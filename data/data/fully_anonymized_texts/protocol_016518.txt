Investigators	 (co-investigators),	 Study	Team	 Members,	 and	 Institutional	Affiliations	Principal	Investigator:	[INVESTIGATOR_441324],	MD		The	University	of	[LOCATION_007]	at	Austin,	Dell	Medical	School		Dell	Children’s	Medical	Center	of	Central	[LOCATION_007]		Austin,	TX			Co-Investigators:	Michael	Gardiner,	MD	The	University	of	[LOCATION_007]	at	Austin,	Dell	Medical	School		Dell	Children’s	Medical	Center	of	Central	[LOCATION_007]		Austin,	TX		III. Source	of	Funding	This	 study	 has	 received	 funding	 from	 the	 2014	 Scientific,	 Education	 and	 Research	Foundation	of	UTSW	Austin	Research/Fellow	Grant	(SERF-RG)	in	the	amount	of	$4997	to	cover	equipment	and	gift	cards	for	patient	enrollment	incentive.				The	Dell	Children’s	Medical	Center	Pediatric	Emergency	Medicine	Fellowship	will	fund	any	further	expenses	incurred.		IV. Hypothesis,	Research	Questions,	or	Goals	of	the	Project	The	 objective	of	 this	 study	is	 to	evaluate	 the	 efficacy	of	 two	 different	 nebulizers.	 	We	hypothesize	 that	 albuterol	 delivered	 with	 a	 breath-enhanced	 nebulizer	 will	 lead	 to	statistically	greater	improvement	in	FEV1	when	compared	to	an	equivalent	dose	delivered	via	 a	 standard	 t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441325].	The	 primary	 aim	 will	 be	 to	 study	 changes	 in	forced	expi[INVESTIGATOR_441326]	 (FEV1)	 in	 patients	 presenting	 to	 an	 urban	 pediatric	emergency	department	with	a	moderate	to	severe	acute	asthma	exacerbation	when	utilizing	these	two	nebulizers.		Secondary	aims	will	include	evaluation	of	hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441327],	emergency	department	(ED)	length	of	stay	(LOS),	changes	in	asthma	severity	scores,	vital	sign	changes,	medication	side	effects,	and	total	quantity	of	albuterol	given	in	the	ED.		A	distal	aim	of	the	study	will	be	to	perform	a	cost	analysis;	though	we	will	likely	need	further	clinical	trials	utilizing	multiple	dose	administration	in	order	to	accurately	analyze	cost.					V. Background	and	Significance	Acute	 asthma	 exacerbation	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most	 frequent	 reasons	 for	 children	 to	 visit	 the	emergency	department.		According	to	the	2011	Centers	for	Disease	Control	and	Prevention	National	Health	Interview	Survey,	there	are	7.1	million	children	living	with	a	diagnosis	of	
Version	date:	30JULY2017	asthma.1	Among	the	surveyed	children,	58%	had	at	least	one	asthma	attack	within	the	prior	year.[ADDRESS_560178]	of	$[ADDRESS_560179]	 (SABA),	systemic	 glucocorticoids,	 and	 correction	 of	hypoxemia.2	While	it	has	long	been	accepted	that	the	use	of	inhaled	SABA	is	efficacious,	the	optimal	route	of	administration	has	been	controversial.		Despi[INVESTIGATOR_441328]	(MDI)	with	spacer	are	likely	as	effective	as	nebulizers,	ED	physicians	in	the	United	States	have	been	reluctant	to	change	their	practice.3-[ADDRESS_560180]	evaluated	 these	 newer	 technology	 nebulizers	 in	 pediatric	 patients	 presenting	 with	 acute	asthma	exacerbations.		One	randomized	controlled	trial	of	pediatric	patients	demonstrated	decreased	 symptom	scores,	 respi[INVESTIGATOR_441329],	and	 lower	 admission	rates	 with	the	use	of	breath-actuated	nebulizers	compared	to	t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441330].15	We	were	only	able	to	identify	one	 study	 which	 analyzed	 spi[INVESTIGATOR_441331].16	In	 this	 study,	 patients	 receiving	 inhaled	 terbutaline	 showed	greater	FEV1	improvement	using	a	breath-actuated	device	as	compared	to	a	constant	flow	nebulizer.			
Version	date:	30JULY2017		To	our	knowledge,	the	efficacy	of	breath-enhanced	compared	to	t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441332].		There	is	an	ongoing	study	at	our	institution	(principal	investigator	[INVESTIGATOR_441333].	Wilkinson)	that	is	evaluating	ED	LOS	in	pediatric	asthma	patients	when	placed	on	a	breath-enhanced	versus	t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441334].		[CONTACT_441383]’s	study	is	not	evaluating	FEV1	or	other	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441335]	a	single	treatment.		Measurement	 of	 FEV1	has	 been	 used	 throughout	 other	 asthma	 literature	as	 a	 reliable	measure	 of	 airway	 obstruction	 and	 effectiveness	 of	 treatment	 in	 patients	 with	 acute	asthma.16-19	FEV1	measurement	has	been	recommended	by	[CONTACT_441369],	Lung,	and	Blood	 Institute	 (NHLBI)	 as	 a	 means	 of	 assessing	 the	 degree	 of	 airway	 obstruction,	 and	response	to	therapy	in	acute	asthma.2	In	their	2007	guidelines,	the	NHLBI	recommended	routine	FEV1	measurements	in	all	patients	presenting	for	acute	asthma	exacerbations,	as	this	measure	is	a	more	reliable	indicator	of	severity	of	exacerbations	than	severity	of	symptoms.2	Additionally,	 FEV1	is	 more	 useful	 than	 peak	 expi[INVESTIGATOR_441336]	 (PEF)	 due	 to	 the	 ability	 to	evaluate	flow-volume	loops	and	distinguish	poor	effort	and	restrictive	lung	diseases	from	asthma-related	obstruction.20-22	For	all	of	these	reasons,	we	feel	it	is	pertinent	to	study	this	breath-enhanced	 nebulizer	 technology	 in	relation	 to	 clinical	 spi[INVESTIGATOR_441337].		VI. Research	Method,	Design,	and	Proposed	Statistical	Analysis	This	 study	 will	 be	 a	 blinded	 observer,	 randomized,	 controlled	 trial	 comparing	 breath-enhanced	nebulizer	albuterol	therapy	with	nebulized	albuterol	administered	via	a	t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441338].				The	study	site	will	be	the	Dell	Children’s	Medical	Center	Emergency	Department,	an	urban	pediatric	ED	with	approximately	80,000	visits	per	year,	of	which	than	3000	visits	are	due	to	asthma	 related	 issues.		The	 patient	 population	 will	 include	 children	 with	 previously	diagnosed	asthma,	aged	≥	6	years	to	<	[ADDRESS_560181]	an	initial	FEV1	less	than	70%	predicted	based	on	NHANES	III	study	data	(moderate	to	severe	exacerbation).	2,15,[ADDRESS_560182]	no	clinical	evidence	of	exacerbation	by	[CONTACT_441370]	(PAS	score	of	0),	have	preexisting	chronic	lung	disease	besides	asthma,	have	congenital	heart	disease,	have	neuromuscular	disease,	have	a	suspected	intrathoracic	foreign	body,	have	an	allergy	or	other	contraindication	to	a	study	medication,	or	have	severe	breathing	difficulty	requiring	immediate	resuscitation.									Subject	Eligibility:	Inclusion:	
Version	date:	30JULY2017	1. Age	≥	6	years	and	<	18	years	2. History	of	physician	diagnosed	asthma	3. Presenting	to	ED	with	acute	asthma	exacerbation	4. Parent	or	guardian	speaks	English	or	Spanish.

Allergy	or	other	contraindication	to	study	medication		Subjects	will	be	identified	in	triage	and	will	be	screened	and	enrolled	by	a	member	of	the	study	team	(P1).		A	research	nurse	will	be	available	for	6-[ADDRESS_560183]	of	care	in	many	 emergency	 departments	 nationwide	 (either	 as	spi[INVESTIGATOR_038],	 or	PEF	measurements).		Performing	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441339],	and	for	children	who	have	FEV1	greater	than	70%	predicted	or	those	unable	to	perform	acceptable	spi[INVESTIGATOR_038],	this	will	allow	them	to	be	excluded	and	their	asthma	treated	more	promptly.		This	will	avoid	excluded	children	having	to	undergo	consent	prior	to	being	excluded	and	receiving	treatment	for	their	acute	 asthma.	 	Consent	 will	 be	 obtained	 from	 the	parent	 or	guardian	 of	 all	 patients,	 and	assent	obtained	from	patients	who	are	at	least	7	years	of	age.		If	required	prior	to	study	enrollment,	supplemental	oxygen	may	be	administered	to	maintain	oxygen	saturation	>	90%	if	there	is	evidence	of	hypoxemia	on	continuous	pulse-oximetry.		If	there	is	a	delay	of	greater	than	15	minutes	due	to	the	consent	process,	a	unit	dose	(2.5mg)	of	albuterol	may	be	given	with	a	standard	t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441340]	[ADDRESS_560184]	an	initial	set	of	vital	signs	 (temperature,	 heart	 rate,	 respi[INVESTIGATOR_441341],	 blood	 pressure,	 and	 peripheral	 pulse	oximetry),	and	record	baseline	asthma	scores	using	multiple	previously	validated	asthma	severity	 scores	(PAS	 and	 PASS).24,25	At	 this	 point,	 study	 patients	 will	 be	 randomized	 to	receive	 treatment	 with	 either	 the	 experimental	 (breath-enhanced)	 or	 control	 (t-pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959])	nebulizer.		Randomization	will	be	performed	with	a	computerized	randomization	process.		Pre-assigned	opaque	envelopes	will	be	used	in	order	to	conceal	randomized	assignments,	preventing	 any	 knowledge	 of	 patient	 assignment	 to	 the	 enrolling	 personnel.	 	 A	 second	
Version	date:	30JULY2017	member	of	the	study	team	(P2)	will	open	the	subject’s	randomized	folder	that	will	dictate	the	 appropriate	 therapy	 arm.	 P2	 will	administer	 a	 single	5mg	 dose	 of	 albuterol	 via	 the	appropriate	nebulizer	as	determined	by	[CONTACT_17628].		P1	will	be	blinded	to	the	treatment	arm,	whereas	P2	will	not	be	blinded.		Following	[ADDRESS_560185]	including	a	repeat	set	of	vital	signs,	pulse-oximetry,	asthma	scoring,	and	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441342].					Patients	 randomized	 to	 the	 “control”	 arm	 will	 receive	 therapy	 with	 our	 standard	 ED	nebulizer,	 the	 Hudson	 RCI®	Micro	 Mist®	nebulizer	 (Teleflex	 Medical®,	 Research	 Triangle	Park,	NJ).		The	treatment	will	be	preferentially	administered	with	a	mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].	Patients	unable	or	unwilling	to	use	a	mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]	(as	determined	by	[CONTACT_941]	P2)	will	receive	therapy	with	a	simple	mask	(Hudson	RCI®,	Teleflex	Medical®,	Research	Triangle	Park,	NJ).			Patients	 randomized	 to	 the	 “experimental”	 arm	 will	 receive	 therapy	 with	 a	 NebuTech®	HDN®,	Breath-Enhanced	High	Density	Jet	Nebulizer	(Salter	Labs®,	Arvin,	CA).		Treatments	will	be	preferentially	administered	with	a	mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].	Patients	unable	or	unwilling	to	use	a	mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]	(as	determined	by	[CONTACT_941]	P2)	will	receive	therapy	with	a	mask.		The	NebuTech®	HDN®	allows	for	a	proprietary	vented	mask,	which	still	utilizes	the	breath-enhanced	features	of	the	system	(I-GuardTM	Valved	Aerosol	Delivery	System,	Salter	Labs®,	Arvin,	CA).				Spi[INVESTIGATOR_441343]	 a	 handheld	 spi[INVESTIGATOR_441344]	(NDD	EasyOne®).[ADDRESS_560186]	recent	American	Thoracic	 Society	 guidelines,	 participants	 will	 asked	 to	 perform	 a	 minimum	 of	 3	 and	maximum	 of	 8	 forced	 expi[INVESTIGATOR_441345]	 3	 adequate	 samples	 as	determined	by	[CONTACT_441371].27	Based	on	prior	data,	more	than	8	attempts	at	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441346]’s	performance	on	lung	function	testing27.		The	highest	recorded	FEV1	will	be	used	for	analysis.		Flow-volume	loops	will	 be	 evaluated	 by	 a	 pulmonologist	 in	 order	 to	 assess	 adequacy	 of	 spi[INVESTIGATOR_441347],	and	those	with	inadequate	loops	will	be	excluded	from	FEV1	analysis.		The	pulmonologist	involved	will	be	blinded	to	therapy	arm.		A	member	of	the	research	team	will	collect	baseline	data	from	the	subject’s	guardian.		Data	will	be	recorded	on	a	standardized	form	and	will	include	subject	demographics	(including	age,	ethnicity,	primary	care	provider),	baseline	home	therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],	and	assessment	of	baseline	asthma	 severity,	nature	 and	 duration	of	current	symptoms,	 and	treatments	 prior	 to	 ED	arrival.		Following	the	post-treatment	assessment,	the	P1	(blinded)	study	personnel	will	be	asked	to	predict	which	nebulizer	was	utilized	in	the	study,	in	order	to	evaluate	adequacy	of	blinding.		Following	completion	of	the	experimental	stage	as	detailed	above,	patients	will	be	released	to	receive	standard	of	care	therapy	as	determined	by	[CONTACT_441372].		We	 anticipate	 that	 the	 majority	 of	 patients	 will	 receive	 care	 according	 to	the	 DCMC	ED	asthma	pathway,	 including	 administration	 of	inhaled	 ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_441348].		However,	some	patients	may	be	treated	off	of	the	ED	pathway,	and	variability	in	subsequent	therapy	is	possible.		Data	will	be	recorded	on	a	standardized	form	
Version	date:	30JULY2017	regarding	subsequent	therapy	through	the	remainder	of	the	patients’	ED	course.		Patients	who	 are	 admitted	 to	 the	 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441349].	Following	 disposition	 from	 the	 ED,	 no	further	data	will	be	obtained	from	patients.		Sample	Size	Treatment	groups	will	be	analyzed	on	an	intention-to-treat	basis.		The	primary	outcome	for	this	study	is	change	in	FEV1	from	initial	presentation	to	reassessment.		By	[CONTACT_441373],16,[ADDRESS_560187]	conducted	a	sample	size	calculation	using	an	 estimated	 baseline	 initial	 FEV1	of	 55%	 predicted,	 and	 an	 estimated	 10%	 FEV1	improvement	 with	 standard	 of	 care.	 	The	 calculations	were	 performed	 using	STATA	 13	statistical	software	(StataCorp,	LP,	College	Station,	TX).	In	order	to	detect	an	improvement	differential	of	5%	(absolute)	between	treatment	arms,	with	a	power	of	0.80	and	alpha	of	0.05,	we	will	need	64	patients	enrolled	in	each	arm.		It	has	been	shown	previously	that	as	few	 as	 35%-65%	 of	 patients	 with	 severe	 asthma	 exacerbations	 are	 able	 to	 successfully	perform	 peak	 expi[INVESTIGATOR_441350].22,[ADDRESS_560188]	that	we	will	be	enrolling	patients	6	years	and	older,	we	estimate	that	with	sufficient	coaching,	approximately	60%	of	patients	in	this	study	will	be	able	to	successfully	complete	interpretable	 spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].	 	Based	on	 this,	we	will	 need	 to	 enroll	[ADDRESS_560189]	deviations	 for	 continuous	 data,	 percentages	 for	 categorical	 data,	 and	 medians	 with	interquartile	ranges	for	ordinal	data.		Secondary	 outcomes	 for	 this	 study	 will	 include	 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_441351],	emergency	department	(ED)	length	of	stay	(LOS),	changes	in	asthma	severity	scores,	vital	sign	changes,	medication	side	effects,	and	total	quantity	of	albuterol	given	in	the	ED.		Analysis	of	these	variables	will	be	completed	using	appropriate	statistical	analysis	depending	on	the	nature	of	the	data	(t-test	for	continuous,	chi	square	of	Fisher’s	exact	test	for	categorical,	and	Mann-Whitney	U	test	for	ordinal).	Non-parametric	tests	will	be	used	when	appropriate.		Finally,	if	significant	baseline	differences	in	the	groups	occur,	linear	multivariable	regression	analysis	of	the	primary	endpoint	will	be	performed	to	adjust	for	potential	confounders.			VII. Human	Subject	Interactions	a. Sources	of	Potential	Participants	
Version	date:	30JULY2017	Subjects	will	be	screened	for	enrolment	if	they	present	to	the	DCMC	ED	with	signs	of	an	acute	asthma	exacerbation.	The	nursing	staff	at	triage,	as	well	as	Pediatric	Emergency	Medicine	study	personnel	will	identify	potential	research	subjects.		In	addition,	a	full	time	research	RN	will	be	available	to	assist	with	identification	and	enrollment	of	potential	subjects,	if	funding	allows	 as	 mentioned	above.	Subjects	 that	 meet	 all	 inclusion	 and	 exclusion	 criteria	 and	consent	to	participate	will	be	enrolled.		b. Procedure	for	Recruitment	of	Participants	All	 patients	 who	 have	 physician-diagnosed	 asthma	 will	 be	 triaged	 upon	 arrival	 to	 the	emergency	department,	and	will	be	evaluated	by	a	triage	nurse.		Upon	identification	of	a	patient	 with	 previously	 diagnosed	 asthma	 who	 is	 presenting	with	 breathing	difficulty	or	cough,	the	triage	nurse	will	contact	[CONTACT_441374],	either	in	the	form	of	the	research	nurse	(if	 available)	 or	 other	 study	 personnel	 who	 are	 available	 within	 the	 ED.	Additionally,	research	personnel	may	identify	subjects	through	periodic	monitoring	of	the	ED	tracking	board	from	the	research	office.	Study	personnel	will	approach	the	parent	or	guardian	for	potential	study	enrollment.		As	a	part	of	screening	for	inclusion	and	exclusion	criteria,	study	personnel	 will	 briefly	 explain	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 research	 project	 and	 perform	baseline	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441352].		Performance	of	this	minimal	risk	study	is	considered	by	[CONTACT_441375],	and	will	expedite	screening	of	patients	if	performed	prior	to	consent.		c. Procedure	of	Obtaining	Informed	Consent	Potential	subjects	and	their	parent	or	guardian	will	have	the	nature	of	the	research	study	as	well	as	potential	risks	and	benefits	of	enrollment	explained	by	[CONTACT_441374].		Consent	will	be	obtained	from	the	parent	or	guardian	of	all	subjects,	and	assent	obtained	from	subjects	who	are	at	least	7	years	of	age.		A	consent	form	written	in	English	or	Spanish	will	be	provided	to	the	parent/guardian	based	on	their	preferred	language.		A	Spanish	interpreter	will	be	utilized	as	needed	to	answer	questions	and	ensure	clear	understanding	of	expectations	after	enrollment.		Subjects	and	parents	will	be	given	adequate	time	to	consider	enrollment,	and	questions	will	be	encouraged	and	answered	prior	to	enrollment.			d. Research	Protocol	It	 will	 be	 explained	 to	 subjects	 and	 guardians	 that	 if	 enrolled	 in	 the	 study,	 that	 study	participation	 will	 involve	receiving	 an	albuterol	 therapy	 with	 either	 the	 control	 or	experimental	nebulizer,	assigned	randomly,	and	performing	follow-up	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441353].		It	will	be	explained	that	all	of	these	therapi[INVESTIGATOR_441354],	and	will	take	approximately	[ADDRESS_560190]	completion	data	is	November	
Version	date:	30JULY2017	2017,	followed	by	[CONTACT_441376].			DCMC	ED	sees	approximately	[ADDRESS_560191]	 with	 access	 restricted	 to	 the	 research	 staff	working	directly	on	data	analysis.		Paper	records	including	data	collection	forms	containing	patient	identifiers,	copi[INVESTIGATOR_441355]	a	patient’s	medical	chart,	or	other	records	containing	protected	health	information	(PHI),	will	be	maintained	in	a	study	folder	identified	by	[CONTACT_441377].		These	folders	will	be	kept	in	a	locked	cabinet	located	in	a	locked,	badge-controlled	facility.		Once	the	database	has	been	compi[INVESTIGATOR_441356],	PHI	will	be	removed	such	that	the	only	link	 between	 the	 study	 ID	 number	 and	 the	 patient	 will	 be	 a	 key,	 which	 will	 be	 stored	separately	from	the	study	database.		Data	stored	on	the	internal	memory	of	the	handheld	spi[INVESTIGATOR_441357]’s	study	ID	number	without	other	PHI.		All	patient	identifiers	will	be	removed	following	data	collection	and	analysis.		All	study	records	will	be	maintained	at	least	as	long	as	required	by	[CONTACT_2371].		The	data	from	this	study	may	be	published,	but	subject	identities	will	not	be	disclosed.		h. Research	Resources	Research	personnel	will	consist	of	Pediatric	Emergency	Medicine	(PEM)	Fellowship	faculty,	PEM	fellows,	and	the	PEM	Fellowship	research	nurse/coordinator.	All	of	the	research	efforts	of	 these	 people	 are	 reimbursed	 through	 the	 standard	 academic	 pay	 mechanism	 of	 the	fellowship.	No	additional	resources	will	be	required.	Equipment	costs	will	be	covered	by	[CONTACT_441378].	 Any	 additional	 costs	 will	 be	covered	 by	 [CONTACT_441379]	 (if	needed).		VIII. Potential	Risks	and	Alternatives	There	is	a	potential	risk	to	patients	of	loss	of	confidentiality.		This	risk	is	minimized	utilizing	the	 methods	 described	 above.	 	 If	 the	 experimental	 nebulizer	 shows	 decreased	 efficacy	compared	 to	 the	control	 arm,	 subjects	 may	 experience	 less	 bronchodilation,	 and	subsequently	 may	 require	 more	 subsequent	 doses	 of	 albuterol,	 or	 other	 adjunctive	therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].	 	 There	 is	 no	 reason	 to	 believe	 that	 patients	 in	 the	 experimental	 group	 will	experience	greater	discomfort	than	those	patients	in	the	control	group.		Data and safety Monitoring: This study involves [ADDRESS_560192] been used clinically for decades. The medication doses are similar to those used by [CONTACT_441380]. For these 
Version	date:	30JULY2017	reasons this study is considered very low risk and equivalent to the ED standard of care for non-study patients.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], a	Data	and	Safety	Monitoring	Plan	will	be	in	place	for	ongoing	evaluation	of	the	safety	of	this	study.		 The DSMP will consist of the PI ([CONTACT_174445]) and the Co-I ([CONTACT_359131]) reviewing any reported adverse events within 24 hours of occurrence. Additionally, at the midpoint of the study (subject #107), there will be a scheduled interim analysis. During this analysis we will analyze group difference with regards to adverse event and admission rates. If, during either of these reviews, new information is discovered that would change the risk profile of the study, enrollment will be suspended and the IRB will be notified to help determine a course of action. 		IX. Potential	Benefits	The	potential	benefit	of	this	trial	is	the	possibility	of	a	better	understanding	of	the	effect	of	breath-enhanced	nebulizer	technology	on	the	treatment	of	acute	asthma.		Additionally,	if	we	are	able	to	demonstrate	significant	benefit	of	 this	new	technology,	this	may	enhance	the	treatment	of	future	pediatric	patients	with	asthma,	at	home	or	in	the	emergency	department.		The	 potential	 benefit	 of	 this	 study	 to	 the	 individual	 study	 patient	 is	 largely	 unknown.		Patients	who	are	randomized	to	the	experimental	arm	of	the	study	may	experience	greater	bronchodilation	due	to	improved	medication	delivery;	however,	this	benefit	is	likely	minimal	given	that	this	study	is	evaluating	only	a	single	dose	of	albuterol.		X. Sites	or	Agencies	involved	in	the	research	project	Research	activities	will	be	carried	out	exclusively	at	Dell	Children’s	Medical	Center.		XI. Review	by	[CONTACT_441381].		XII. Citations	1.

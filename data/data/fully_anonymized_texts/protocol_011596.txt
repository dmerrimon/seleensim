Protocol: A- 101-WART- [ADDRESS_1052407] inclusion/exclusion criteria will be re -assessed prior to randomization during Visit 2.  
2Investigational sites will assign a unique five -digit subject identifier to each subject at Visit 1. This subject identifier will be used in all study documentation for th e duration 
of the study.  
3Each subject’s skin must be assessed during Visit 1 using the Fitzpatrick Skin Type Assessment.  
4Vital signs [including temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, height and weight (Visit 1 only)] will be measur ed by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 9 
and Visit 13.  
5Prior medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_160787] a time -period of 14 days prior to Visit 2.  
6A complete blood count (including hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, red blood cell count and morp hology, white blood cell count and differential (absolute and %) 
including basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils and a clinical chemistry panel including albumin, al kaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate amin otransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LD H), phosphorus, 
potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, and uric acid.  
7The treating investigator will identify at least  1 and up to 6 common warts located on the trunk or extremities that meet the inclusion criteria.  
8 The investigator will use the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) scale to assess each identified common wart. The investigator m ust assess the identified commo n warts 
prior to application of the study medication at Visit [ADDRESS_1052408] a PWA grade ≥ 2.  
9 The investigator will measure the dimensions (longest axis and thickness of the com mon wart) at Visit [ADDRESS_1052409] axis of each common wart at Visits 2 -13. 
10 At Visits 1, Visit 2, 4, 6, and 9 (prior to study medication application), and Visit 10 -13, a q ualified investigational center staff member will take a photograph of each 
identified common wart using the Aclaris supplied camera. All photographs will be sent to a central imaging laboratory.  
11At a sub -set of investigational sites (up to 3 sites), sub jects randomized at these sites will have additional standardized photographs taken of their common warts at the 
following time -points: V2 -[ADDRESS_1052410] their A -101 study medication applied by a parent/legal guardian in front of 
the treating physician or a member of the investigational study staff during in -office visits. If the identified common wart meets the criteria for re - treatment the lesion will be 
re-treated at Visits [ADDRESS_1052411] NOT wash/submerge the treated wart for at least [ADDRESS_1052412] 6 hours. Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the c hild does not put the treated area in the ir mouth, or 
eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry [ADDRESS_1052413]/parent/guardian will perform the second weekly treatment at home.  
16All concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44793] (topi[INVESTIGATOR_160788]) prescription medications, over the counter medications and natural sup plements and non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_767554], physical therapy, and energy -based therapy must be documented in the subject CRF. Subjects must not apply any topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186] ( e.g., moisturizers, sunscreen, 
etc.) to the identified common wart within 12 hours prior to any study visit.  
17The reporting period for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) begins when the subject signs the informed consent and continues through  Visit 11. Non -serious clinical adverse 
events will be collected following the application of the study medication at Visit 2 and t hrough Visit 11. Non -serious adverse events that occur between the time of consent 
and study medication application will be documented as medical history. All safety reporting (AEs and SAEs) will conclude at Visit 11 (approximately [ADDRESS_1052414] 
study  medication application) except for clinical adverse events related to local skin  reactions.

The Intent -to-Treat Population ( ITT) will be used for primary and secondary efficacy 
analyses and summaries.   The Per -Protocol (PP) populatio n will be used for sensitivity 
analyses for the primary efficacy analysis an d all secondary efficacy analyses included in 
the hierarchical testing procedure ( Figure  1).  Subjects will be  summarized and analyzed 
according to randomized treatment group for efficacy . The Safety  Population will be used 
for safety analyses. Subjects will be summarized according to actual treatment received 
at first application of study medication  for safety .  
The baseline scores for PW A will be the last non -missing value collect ed ≤ the date of the 
first application of double -blind study medication .  
For the purpose of analysis, data will be assigned to an analysis visit based on relative 
study day as defined in Appendix B .   
All Data listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_767561]. 
3.1 Study Populations, Disposition, Baseline Characteristics, Medical History 
Concomitant Medications, Exposure and Protocol Violations  
3.1.1 Analysis Populations  
The populations used for analyses will be defined as follows:  
•Intent-t o-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population includes all randomized  
subjects.
•Per-Protocol Population (PP):  The PP Population includes all subjects who  
received at least one application of study medication and had no protocol  
violations as defined in Section 3.1. 5.
•Safety Population: The Safety population includes all subjects who received at  
least one application of study medication.

the study completion status and the reasons for discontinuation  grouped by [CONTACT_767562] (lost to follow-up, adverse event, poor compliance etc.).  
A listing will be provided of all patients discontinued from the study after enrol ment, 
broken down by [CONTACT_767563], giving a patient identifier, the specific 
reason for discontinuation, the treatment (drug and dose), and the duration of treatment 
before discontinuation. Whether or not the blind for the patient was broken at the time of 
discontinuation will be noted. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Aclaris Therapeutics Inc. 05 June 2019  
Protocol: A- 101-WART- 302 Statistical Analysis Plan  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 25 Demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented in the data listings.  
Descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and

[CONTACT_767564] .   
3.1.3 Wart Diagnosis and Characteristics at Baseline  
Descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum) an d/or frequency distributions, as appropriate, will be generated  by 
[CONTACT_767564].   Summarized variables include total warts 
treated, time since first appearance of most and least recent treated warts, longest axis of 
largest wart treated, and thickness of largest wart treated.  
3.1.4 Prior and Concomitant Medications , Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_767555]  (March 2019) .  Prior and co ncomitant 
medications are listed only.  The period(s) in which the medications w ere administered 
will be flagged.  
3.1.5 Protocol Violations  
Protocol violations  will be identified prior to database lock to measure adherence to key 
aspects the protocol  (see section 16.2 of the protocol for full definitions) .    Specific data 
fields that will be examined to identify protocol violations include entrance 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and prohibited prior and concomitant medications  as well as 
all deviations identified by [CONTACT_093] . All protocol violations will be listed  by 
[CONTACT_767565] d summarized (n and percent) by [CONTACT_21964].  
3.2 Efficacy  Endpoints  
The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of A -101 45% compared to  
Vehicle at the endpoint visit, Visit 10 (Day 60). It will be based on the proportion of 
subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all treated common warts.  
Four secondary efficacy analyses will be performed and tested in a hierarchical Fixed -
Sequence step -down method to control alpha among the pre -specified secondary efficacy 
variable s. The predefined order of the tests is specified to be the order of these analyses 
as presented below  (Figure 1) . All analyses will be conducted at the same alpha level (2 -
tail alpha = 0.05). The results of the second analysis will only be reported if the  first 
analysis reaches statistical significance at alpha = 0.05.  The results of the third analysis 
will only be reported if the first and second analyses reach statistical significance, each at 
alpha = 0.05. The results of the fourth analysis will only b e reported if the first, second 
and third analyses reach statistical significance, each at alpha = 0.05.

For regulatory purposes, testing for will halt at the first endpoint with P> 0.05, however 
all endpoints will be analyzed irrespective of the results. Supportive and sensitivity 
analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will also be performed.  
Should sparse enrollment at one or more sites occur, the following algorithm will be 
employed to “pool” sites for analysis. Sites with fewer than [ADDRESS_1052416] s randomized will 
be pooled by [CONTACT_767566] (in the event multiple site s have the same number randomized) and then 
combining the smallest with the next smallest site in the sort order in a stepwise fashion 
until all the sites/pooled sites have  more than  [ADDRESS_1052417] site or 
pooled site.  In the sort order when there are ties in count, a “pooled site” comes after 
non-pooled sites in the pooling hierarchy . The pooled site(s) will be used in all analyses 
that are stratified by [CONTACT_517773]/or  include site in the statistical model.   
3.2.1 Complete Clearance of All Warts  
The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of A -101 45% compared to  
Vehicle at the endpoint visit, Visit 10 (Day 60). It will be based on the proportion of 
subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all treated  common warts. A

Where WARTS represents the number of warts assessed at baseline  (1 wart, 2 warts, 3 
warts, >3 warts) ; TREATMENT is 1 for A -101 and 2 for Vehicle; and RESPONSE = [ADDRESS_1052419], _MH OR_ is the Mantel -Haenszel estimated common 
odds ratio , and L_ MHOR and U_ MHOR are the lower and upper limits, respectively, of 
the corresponding 95% confidence interval.  P_BDCHI is the p -value from the Breslow -
Day test of the homogeneity of the odds ratios across strata and is provided as a 
supportive statistic  to assess the model.  A statistically  significant finding (P<0.05) of the 
Breslow -Day test indicates  that the treatment effect differs by [CONTACT_767568] -specific odds ratios estimates which will be 
included in the output for the primary endpoint .  
3.2.[ADDRESS_1052420] sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be an ana lysis based upon the 
PP population.  This analysis will use the same CMH model described for the primary 
analysis.  
A second sensitivity analysis will be conducted for the primary endpoint using the same 
CMH model  for the ITT  population  that includes the im putation of missing PWA data 
using a fully conditionally specified (FCS) regression -based Multiple Imputation  (MI)  
procedure .  This regression -based MI will be conducted on the worst  (maximum)  PWA 
score for all treated warts at a given visit for each subje ct.  The utilization of the FCS 
methodology accounts for the correlation within a subject  and models mean changes over 
time in the maximum PWA score.  For each subject, only data selected as representative 
of an analysis visit ( i.e. within the defined rela tive day range and closest to the “target”) 
as documented in Appendix B are included in the imputation process.  The imputed data 
will be in the form of the maximum PWA score and will be rounded to an integer and 
bounded by 0 below and 3 above.  All impute d maximum PWA scores that are assigned a 
0 will correspond to complete clearance of all warts at that visit.  The complete clearance

the A -101 45% arm and  a better mean maximum PWA for the vehicle arm.  The shifts 
will be from 0 to 3 in increments of 0.5 for the A -101 45% arm and from 0 to -3 in 
increments of 0.5 for the vehicle arm.  Apart from these tippi[INVESTIGATOR_767557], the analysis 
will follow the same methodology described for the MI procedure.  The odds ratio and 
CMH Chi -square P -value are provided for each of the 7 x 7 =[ADDRESS_1052422] to 
evaluate heterogeneity across  sites.   The SAS syntax differs only by [CONTACT_767569] a “pooled site” as detailed in 
section 3.2.  
3.2.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Visit 13 (Day 137) will be analyzed using an identical model as the primary endpoint at 
Visit 10 (Day 60) .  This will be the first secondary endpoint tested in the hierarchy of 
endpoints described in Section 3.2.   This analysis will be run on the ITT population  using 
randomized treatment group .  
Sensitivity a nalyses performed for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the Visit [ADDRESS_1052423] percent of warts cleared at Visit 13 (Day 137) will be evaluated as the 
second secondar y endpoint using analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) with treatment 
group and site as class variables and the baseline number of warts assessed as a 
continuous covariate.  Patents without a week Visit 13 measurement according to the 
assignment to analysis visi t in Appendix B  will be assigned a score of 0% warts cleared. 
Ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be constructed about the estimated 
treatment difference based on the model estimates and associated variability.

The duration of treatment, the number of application days (i.e. the actual count of days 
where an application occurred), the mean applications per wart (for e ach subject the sum 
of all applications across all  treated  warts and all application days divided by [CONTACT_767571]), and the total applications will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, min imum and maximum). The 
percentage of total wart treatments that were performed in 1 , 2 or 3 applications is also 
provided.  
Overall c ompliance is calculated as the number total number of warts treated for the 
treatment period (through date of last applicati on to any wart) divided by [CONTACT_767572]. The total number of warts treated is the sum of 
the retreatment and home application diary records completed times the number of warts 
assessed at baseline minus the number of war ts scored as PWA=[ADDRESS_1052430] recent assessment (<= the date of the application ). 
3.3.2 Adverse Events  
Adverse events are coded using the MedDRA (Version 22) dictionary  and are categorized 
by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Only treatment emergent adverse 
events are included in summary tabulations  (i.e. adverse events occurring on or after the 
first application of study medication and within [ADDRESS_1052431] application of 
study medication) . All adverse event s are included in the data listings  including those that 
are not considered treatment emergent.   
Aclaris Therapeutics Inc. 05 June 2019  
Protocol: A- 101-WART- [ADDRESS_1052432] application of study medication are considered "prior”. Adverse events with 
onset dates on or after the first application of double -blind study medication  and within 
[ADDRESS_1052433] application of study medication are c onsidered “treatment 
emergent”.  Events with onset dates more than [ADDRESS_1052434] application of study 
medication are considered as "post -therapy".    
Frequency tabulations are presented by [CONTACT_53189], for all adverse 
events; study treatment -related, adverse events resulting in discontinuation of study 
treatment, serious adverse events and adverse events by [CONTACT_764] . Adverse 
events resulting in  discontinuation  are those with ‘action taken’ recorded as ‘d rug 
withdrawn ’. 
Treatment emergent adverse event summaries by [CONTACT_767573]:  
Age (<18,  18 to 65, and > 65)
Sex (Male, Female)
Race (White, Non -White)
3.3.[ADDRESS_1052435] application of study 
medication  will be tabulated by [CONTACT_767574].  
3.3.4 Vital Signs  
Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_767558] e ach visit. Both actual values 
and changes from baseline will be  summarized.  
3.3.5 Laboratory Evaluations  
Shift tables showing changes in relationship to the normal reference range grade from 
baseline to th e “worst ” relationship recorded post -baseline are tabulat ed.  In the event a 
subject  had both “low” and “high” post -baseline values the subject  will be counted under 
both “low” and “high”.  As such , the percentages of the cells in the shift table may add to 
more than 100%.   
Chemistry and hematology parameters  are summarized using descriptive statistics for

Protocol: A- 101-WART- [ADDRESS_1052436] 26% for Active 
compared with 9% for Vehicle is anticipated. Assuming a distribution of treated warts per 
subject comparable to the Phase [ADDRESS_1052437] 
of an advantage in subjec t responder rates (all treated warts with PWA=0) for Active over 
Vehicle groups of at least 11 percentage points. This leads to a required sample size for 
the current study of approximately 500 subjects to provide greater than 90% power to 
achieve statisti cal significance in the primary efficacy analysis. This projection takes into 
account the impact of the anticipated subject  dropout rate on power for the primary 
efficacy analysis, based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population and planned missing data 
impu tation  procedures.  
Additionally, a simulation was conducted in a manner that accounted for the distribution 
of multiple warts, the treatment effect in clearance between the different warts and the 
correlation in wart clearance among multiple warts.  Specif ic details of the simulation are 
described in Appendix C.  Results of this simulation indicate that data from 500 subjects 
(250 per group) will provide 97% power to demonstrate the superiority of 45% A -101 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_767559].    
3.6 Changes in/ Clarifications to the Conduct of the Study or Planned 
Analysis  
The secondary endpoint of mean per subject percent of warts decreased will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_376901] (ANCOV A) including, in addition to the treatment, terms for 
baseline number of warts as a continuous covariate and study site as a class variable.  The 
protocol mentioned only analysis of variance (ANOV A) with specifying the treatment 
term to be included in the model.  
A Breslow -Day test of the homogeneity of th e odds rations across strata for the analysis 
of the primary endpoint – i.e. across the strata defined by [CONTACT_182610] r of warts assessed at 
baseline – is added to assess the model.  
A PP Population has been added to test the sensitivity of the primary and se lect secondary 
analyses to major violations in the protocol.  
A “Safety  Population” has been added that will be used for all  safety summaries as

Due to the possibility  of deviation from the protocol schedule as well as to incorporate 
data from unscheduled and/ or early termination visits, analysis visits are defined below 
based on relative study day.  These analysis visits are based on the nominal, scheduled 
visits in the protocol but allow for wider windows (more days around the target study 
day).  Analysis vis it will be used in analyses performed by [CONTACT_767576].  Both nominal visits as collected on the CRF and 
analysis visits will be retained in the SAS ADaM datasets.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 25 APPENDIX C:  SIMULATION DETAILS FOR POWER COMPUTATION 
A 27-parameter multinomial distribution was used to simulate the primary endpoint in 
the Phase 3 WART studies.  The 27 parameters corresponding to the 27 possibilities for 
the number of warts that are cleared at Visit 10 is shown in Table 2 . 
Table 2: Grid of [ADDRESS_1052440] (1 baseline wart), 
second (2 baseline warts) and third (3 baseline warts) strata were obtained from X2, X5 
and X9, respectively, as defined in the grid in Table 2 .  The number of cleared warts in 
the 4th striatum was obtained from the sum of X14, X20 and X27.  The odds ratio 
between A101 45% and vehicle was tested using a CMH stratified by [CONTACT_75327] 4 strata.  The 
number of positive simulation results divided by [CONTACT_767577].

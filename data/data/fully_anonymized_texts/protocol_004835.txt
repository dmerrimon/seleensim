physical activity intervention using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy ; 
Aim 1, Phase 2    
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_375303] M. Ostendorf, PhD  
Version Date:  3/29/23        
 
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :  A critical challenge  in the prevention of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) is increasing the proportion of adults who are able to lose weight and maintain their weight 
loss long-term.1 Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of sustained weight loss2 and current 
guidelines recommend high levels of moderate- to-vigorous PA (MVPA, 300 min/wk) for weight 
management.3 However, long- term adherence to PA remains low in adults with overweight or 
obesity enrolled in lifestyle weight management programs .4-6 My previous work indicates that 
adults with overweight or obesity are more likely to adhere to PA when PA is consistent with their 
values and is perceived as enjoyable. This is consistent with Self -Determination Theory (SDT), 
which supports autonomous motivation as a critical factor in promoting sustained PA adherence.
7-10 Based on my work, and the work of others11-14, I developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a brief , 
SDT-based, PA support program (called Move) in adults with BMI 25- 45 kg/m2 who were enrolled 
in a 12- month lifestyle weight management program. Currently, Move consists of two, group-
based sessions that support autonomous motivation for PA by [CONTACT_865045]. Participants who attended 
both Move sessions demonstrated a greater increase in MVPA at 12 months compared to those 
who did not attend both Move sessions.  Focus group feedback (n=39) indicated high 
enthusiasm for Move,  but also a strong desire for individualized support and additional Move 
content. Thus, the next step to refine this intervention is to add novel intervention components 
that target barriers to PA that were identified in the focus group feedback . We propose to create 
Move+  by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] 3 additional SDT -based components: 1) 1:1 support sessions (to provide 
individualized support), 2) guided positive exercise mental imagery sessions (to address negative 
feelings around PA), and 3) low -cost, livestream fitness membership (to improve PA access). We 
hypothesize that these Move+  components will improve autonomous motivation for PA15, which 
will lead to increased PA adherence, and thus long- term weight loss  (Fig 1 ).  Our specific aim  is: 
 
Aim 1  Phase 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_865019]+  program . We will conduct a 12- week, 
single -arm field trial to pi[INVESTIGATOR_865019]+  program.  
 
 II. Background and Significance : The burden of obesity, associated with cardiovascular disease 
(CVD ) and early mortality, will continue to be critical public health concern if the issues 
surrounding poor long- term weight loss maintenance are not addressed.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_865020] -term

 PA) is a key predictor of weight loss maintenance5, [ADDRESS_1206792] majority (~90%) of adults 
with overweight or obesity enrolled in current lifestyle weight management programs do not meet 
PA guidelines for weight management long- term (≥12 months after start of intervention).5, 23 -25 
Although many factors contribute to poor l ong-term PA adherence4, 26 -29, absence of accessible, 
effective, theory -based programs that account for each person’s values30, motivation, and 
preferences31-34 remains a major barrier. Thus, there is a critical need for person- centered and 
scalable interventions that promote long- term adherence to PA in adults with overweight/obesity.  
 
I developed a brief, person -centered PA support program, called Move , designed to 
enhance explicit  autonomous motivation for PA in adults with overweight or obesity. The  
Move program is based on the Self -Determination Theory (SDT) and targets enhanced PA 
adherence. Move supports autonomous motivation for PA by [CONTACT_865046]. SDT is compelling to focus on in the context of PA because it distinguishes the quantity from the quality of explicit motivation for 
PA. Autonomous motives, in contrast to controlled motives (e.g. rewards, guilt), are considered 
high-quality because PA is perceived to be consistent with individual values and inherent 
interests.35 The quality of explicit  motivation is determined by [CONTACT_865047] a context (e.g. 
exercise) satisfies 3 basic psychological needs: autonomy (actions are authentic and freely chosen), competence (feeling capable of achieving goals), and relatedness (connection to 
others).
[ADDRESS_1206793] the importance of autonomous motives for PA adherence 
and provided key insight for Move.  
 
Move+  targets both explicit  and implicit  motivation , which  may enhance  PA adherence:  
PA motivation involves both explicit  (conscious thoughts, autonomous motives) and implicit  
processes (automatic, may occur without awareness). Implicit attitudes towards PA  represent an 
individual’s ‘gut’ reaction towards a PA stimulus (e.g. seeing a person running)39, can be positive 
or negative, and may occur without conscious awareness. There is increased evidence that these implicit processes are associated with PA behavior.
40-44 [CONTACT_376365] (collaborator) is an 
expert in studying this association. In his study of [ADDRESS_1206794]  will integrate guided positive exercise mental imagery 
as a novel Move+  intervention component to support long- term PA adherence . Thus, the 
proposed study is novel because our SDT -based PA program targets improved long- term PA 
adherence by [CONTACT_865048], an approach that has not yet been applied in a weight management program.  
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
 
Two Move sessions improved explicit autonomous motivation for PA and PA 
adherence over 12 months: As part of my F32 award (DK122652), I pi[INVESTIGATOR_865021] a 12- month lifestyle weight 
management program with two, 60- min group sessions. In a preliminary analysis, 
participants who attended both Move sessions demonstrated 1) a significant 
increase in autonomous motivation for PA at 12 months ( Fig 2 A), and 2) were more

valid PA data (activPAL, ≥4 days ; cadence ≥75)  
 likely to meet the PA guidelines o f ≥300 min/week of device- measured moderate- to-
vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) at 12 months ( Fig 2 B).  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
However, participants were not randomized to receive Move and results are likely confounded by 
[CONTACT_1604], including overall attendance to group- based classes (78% vs. 60%, p<0.01). 
Importantly, qualitative data supports our intervention, as participants (n=39) reported high enthusiasm and acceptability for the Move program (abstract, ObesityWeek  2021). One 
participant stated: “You begin to enjoy [PA] because it becomes part of you. If you start moving in 
ways that you actually enjoy, it’s no longer a chore. It’s something that you just do.” Participants 
also indicated a strong desire for additional Move  program content.  
 
IV. Research  Methods  
The study will take place at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU -AMC). The 
overall objective is to engage research partners  to refine Move+  (Aim 1 , Phase 2). Results will 
inform a future pi[INVESTIGATOR_865022]+ intervention.  
 
A.  Outcome  Measure(s):  To achieve Aim 1 Phase 2, quantitative and qualitative data will be 
collected. Human- centered design testing
47, 48 will occur using a 12- week, single- arm field 
trial where a R egistered Dietitian (RD) delivers ≥1 Move+ session per week (group- class, 
1:1, and/or guided imagery), remotely. Patients will receive a 12- week online fitness 
membership, using the option with the highest acceptability from cycle 1. Research 
partners recommendations will be used to refine intervention components. See Table 1 for 
a description of the assessments by [CONTACT_865049].  The primary study outcomes  
are acceptability and feasibility of the Move+  intervention. Other pre- specified study 
outcomes include exploring changes in SDT -constructs, explicit motivation for PA, implicit 
attitudes towards PA, weight, waist circumference, PA patterns, and cardiovascular 
markers.

 2. Providers, including Registered Dietitians (RDs) with experience delivering weight 
loss or lifestyle intervention curriculum (n= 1) 
We will enrich recruitment of minority participants above the Denver metro proportions59 
(target ≥15% Black, ≥30% Hispanic). A sample size of n= 10 was chosen because ~10 
research partners /cycle identify 95% of design issues.60 Special classes of participants 
considered vulnerable populations will not be included in the study.  Our primary 
recruitment strategy for this study will be university emails, recruitment from existing 
behavioral weight loss interventions (for participant partners ), and through personal 
invitations (for RDs).

C. Study Design and Research Methods  
 
C.1 Screening  
Interested participants will complete an initial REDCap screening questionnaire containing 
demographic information (age, sex at birth, gender, race, ethnicity , etc.). For participants 
with an age >89, their age will be recorded as 89 in the study database. Participant 
Protocol Template  Page 8 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_1206803] in the interviews.  Research partners  who meet initial eligibility criteria will be 
contact[CONTACT_165480] [INVESTIGATOR_865031]. Research partners will receive an 
explanation of the purpose of the study and study expectations, including research partner  
responsibilities and potential risks related to study participation. Interested individuals will be scheduled for an in- person screening visit to determine eligibility for the 12- week field 
trial. 
 Participants will be asked to sign an eConsent via REDCap or Docusign if they agree to 
participate in the study. If a participant declines eConsent, they will be given the option to 
sign a paper consent in- person or remotely and email their signed consent to the study 
team. Following completion of informed consent procedures, potential participant partners  
will undergo a health history and physical examination . Health history and physical 
examinations will be performed by a qualified healthcare provider ( Physician Assistant, 
Nurse Practitioner, or MD ) to ensure that they meet study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Body 
weight and height will be measured to confirm the self -reported BMI . Resting blood 
pressure and heart rate will be measured. Participants will complete the Physical Activity 
Readiness Questionnaire (PAR -Q+)114 to screen for any contraindications to exercise. 
Participants will also complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)[ADDRESS_1206804] (EATS -26)63 and the Questionnaire on Eating 
and Weight Patterns (QWEP -5)64 to screen for eating disorders . Any screening results that 
preclude enrollment will be communicated to potential volunteers who will be recommended to consult with their primary care provider.  Participants who meet eligibility 
criteria will be invited to participate in the study.   
 
Study group assignment:   Phase 2 is a single arm, 12 -week field trial, thus all participant 
partners  will receive the Move+ program and there is no inactive control.  
 C.2 Study Procedures  
 
C.2.1 Description of Move+  Intervention : The Move+  components are 1) group- based 
classes, 2) individual support sessions (for personalized support), 3) guided mental imagery sessions (to address negative feelings around PA) , and 4) low -cost, virtual fitness 
membership (to improve PA access). I worked with Drs. Masters and Conroy to develop 
Move+ curriculum (see Table 2) that targets  SDT constructs.
65 The group- based sessions 
serve as the core curriculum for Move+ , and three 1:[ADDRESS_1206805] acceptability 
from Aim 1 Phase 1 (COMIRB # 22- 0147) . The guided positive exercise imagery scripts 
were developed based on work from Williams et al.66 and prompt several sensory and 
emotional experiences.45

min/week over the 12 weeks.  This target is consistent with current PA guidelines for overall 
health67, 68.  Subjects will be provided an outline of weekly PA goals (min/week) to gradually 
progress to the target of 150 min/week by [CONTACT_5875] 12.  Subjects will be instructed in the use of a 
relative intensity scale to achieve the target intensity as outlined in current PA guidelines67 
(moderate- intensity activity defined as a level of effort of 5 or 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is the 
level of effort of sitting, and 10 is maximal effort).  The primary risks associated with beginning an exercise program are likely to be fatigue, shortness of breath, or muscle soreness during or after 
the training sessions.  It is expected that when these symptoms occur, they will be minor and brief.  
During exercise there is a small risk subjects may experience musculoskeletal injuries.  During exercise there is a small risk subjects may trip or fall.  During exercise there is a very small risk 
subjects will experience cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, 
dizziness, syncope, or lower extremity claudication.  
 
o Risks of the exercise program will be minimized by [CONTACT_865053]/exclusion criteria.  Subjects will have previously undergone a medical screening including medical history interview and physical exam,  and assessment of 
blood pressure.  According to the most recent American College of Sports Medicine 
(ACSM) Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription
61, exercise stress testing 
prior to initiation of moderate or vigorous exercise is only indicated for high- risk 
individuals (i.e. individuals with symptoms of CVD or individuals with known CVD, 
diabetes, pulmonary disease, or end –stage renal disease).  Subjects with these 
conditions are excluded from our study, thus all subjects in our study will be classified 
as low - or moderate- risk by [CONTACT_865054].  
o If subjects experience muscle soreness, we will prescribe light stretching, and hot/cold therapy to reduce the soreness.  If these approaches do not alleviate the soreness, we will advise the use of OTC pain relievers (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], acetaminophen, ibuprofen), 
unless contraindicated.  It is anticipated that some subjects will experience soreness 
during the first few days of exercise, but since the recommended intensity is moderate we expect the symptoms will be minor and transient.  
o Although some minor to moderate orthopedic injuries may occur during the exercise program (primarily lower body musculoskeletal injuries such as muscle sprains, tendonitis, shin splints) given the moderate intensity and gradual increase of the 
exercise prescription we do not expect any severe injuries.  Subjects who experience 
minor to moderate orthopedic injuries will be allowed to remain in the study and return to exercise as tolerated.  
o Participants may feel uncomfortable about answering questions that are being asked group- based classes or individualized support sessions. Participants are not required 
to answer any questions.  To minimize this risk, we will notify participants that they are 
not required to answer any questions and that they may choose to leave the interview 
at any time. In addition, participants can ask to pause the recording at any time. Lastly, we will allow participants to send a chat privately to the interview moderator if they 
want to write down any thoughts or reactions that they would prefer not to share out 
loud, or that they didn’t have a chance to say.  
 
 Qualitative Data:  
Description:  At the end of the 12- week field trial participant partners  will be asked to participate in a 
90-minute semi -structured focus group, and the RD partner  will be asked to participate in a 60-
minute semi -structured interview. The focus group and interview will be conducted remotely, via 
Zoom Videoconferencing,
 a web conference software with full HD video and audio capability, or in-

components. Additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_865035]+  program. 
The study team will make decisions on the final Move+  program content based on research partner  
feedback. Thus, the final Move+  program content will reflect the wants and needs of the research 
partners . We will code for research partner comments that would result in a revision within each 
transcript. We will discuss all potential revisions within our study team meetings and collectively decide on which revisions to make outright, which revisions to develop a prototype for and go back 
to research partners  for input, and which revisions to discard. As a study team, we will ensure that 
all revisions made to the program features are aligned with retain fidelity of the Self -Determination 
Theory.  
 
Semi -structured 60- minute Interviews:  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_865036]+  program including feasibility/acceptability of each Move+  
intervention component, assessment of cultural relevance, and feedback to refine Move+  
components. Additional topi[INVESTIGATOR_865037]+  program.  
 Justification and Risks:  Participating in a focus group or interview poses minimal risk. In addition, 
the subject matter of the interviews, Move+  acceptability/feasibility , is non- sensitive. This measure 
is required to assess our primary study outcome of interest: feasibility and acceptability of the Move+  program. As with all clinical research studies, there is the general risk of breach of 
confidentiality or data security.  To minimize this risk, only the minimal necessary data will be 
collected, and we w ill follow thorough procedures to maintain confidentiality. As part of the verbal 
consent process before each interview, we will ensure that each participant agrees that anything of 
a personal nature that is mentioned in the room will not be repeated to others outside of the discussion group. If anyone is not willing to give their consent to confidentiality, they may be 
excused from the group.  The risks to the subjects, including potential psychological risks from 
interview questions are minimal. Participa nts may feel uncomfortable about answering questions 
that are being asked in the interviews. Participants are not required to answer any questions.  To

ask to pause the recording at any time. Lastly, we will allow participants to send a chat privately to 
the interview moderator if they want to write down any thoughts or reactions that they would prefer not to share out loud, or that they didn’t have a chance to say. If interviews are held in- person 
instead of remotely via Zoom Videoconferencing, we will hand out note cards to each participant that will be collected at the end of the session. These note cards can be used for participants to write down any thoughts or reactions that they would prefer not to share out loud, that they prefer 
not to be recorded, or that they didn’t have a chance to say. There is a slight risk of a time burden 
associated with participating in engagement activities. Subjects enrolled in this study will potentially benefit by [CONTACT_865055]. The potential benefits of the study to the adult population may be significant. This study is 
expected to lead to an enhanced understanding of, and possibly new therapeutic treatments for, obesity treatment/prevention. In light of these potential benefits, the risks to subjects are 
acceptable.   
 
Outcome Questionnaires:  Description:  The following questionnaires listed below will be used to assess the primary and other 
pre-specified outcomes of the study.  
• REDCap Survey on Design Features: After the focus group occurs, research 
partners  may be asked to complete a REDCap survey that asks for partner  input on 
design changes for the Move+  program components. Research partners  may be 
asked to select between two design options for a program component feature that is 
being considered for revision. Whichever option is preferred by [CONTACT_865056]+  program components. Program 
features that are selected by [CONTACT_865057]+  program components. If a feature splits users 50/[ADDRESS_1206809] operationalize Self -Determination Theory.  
• Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM):  At the end of the 12- week field trial, 
research partners  will be asked to evaluate each Move+  component using the AIM
51 
with a 1- 5 Likert scale (1=Completely Disagree, 5=Completely Agree). The AIM is a 
4-item questionnaire that asks research partners  about whether the intervention 
component meets their approval, is appealing, whether they like it, and whether they 
welcome it’s use. The AIM demonstrated strong psychometric properties including 
content validity, discriminant content validity, reliability, structural validity, structural 
invariance, known- groups validity, and responsiveness to change.  
• Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM): At the end of the 12- week field trial , 
research partners  will be asked to evaluate each Move+  component using the IAM51 
with a 1- 5 Likert scale (1=Completely Disagree, 5=Completely Agree). The IAM is a 
4-item questionnaire that asks partners  about whether the intervention component 
seems fitting, suitable, applicable, and/or like a good match.  The IAM demonstrated 
strong psychometric properties including content validity, discriminant content 
validity, reliability, structural validity, structural invariance, known- groups validity, and 
responsiveness to change.  
• Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM): At the end of the 12- week field trial,  
research partners  will be asked to evaluate each Move+  component using the FIM51 
with a 1- 5 Likert scale (1=Completely Disagree, 5=Completely Agree). The FIM is a 
4-item questionnaire that asks partners  about whether the intervention component 
seems implementable, seems possible, seems doable, and seems easy to use.  The 
FIM demonstrated strong psychometric properties including content validity, 
Protocol Template  Page 13 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 discriminant content validity, reliability, structural validity, structural invariance, 
known- groups validity, and responsiveness to change.  
• Weekly Survey:  Every week during the 12- week field trial, patient partners  will be 
asked to rate their satisfaction with specific program components that they received using a 1- 10 Likert scale (1=Strongly Dislike, 10=Strongly Like) , to describe their 
engagement with the virtual fitness membership and rate the classes they tried, and 
to provide any input for refinement/improvement.  
• Net Promoter Score (NPS): At the end of the 12- week field trial , research partners  
will be asked to evaluate each Move+  component using the NPS. The NPS is a 
single question with a 1- 10 Likert scale: How likely is it that you would recommend 
the Move+  component to a friend or colleague? Respondents are grouped as 
follows: 1) promoters (score 9- 10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep referring 
others and fueling growth, 2) passives (score 7- 8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic 
customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings, and 3) detractors (score 0- 6) 
are unhappy customers who can impede growth with negative word- of-mouth. The 
final NPS score is calculated as % promoters -  % detractors. NPS scores range from 
-100 to +100, with scores >0 indicating good acceptability.  
• Perceived Characteristics of Intervention Scale (PCIS): At the end of the 12-
week field trial , the RD partner  will be asked to complete the PCIS (e.g., completed 
in both phases 1- 2). The PCIS is a 20- item scale that measures trialability, relative 
advantage, compatibility, complexity, potential for intervention adaptation, etc. The 
PCIS is a reliable measure of perceived characteristics of interventions, with some 
preliminary support for its validity.
52  Participant partners  will not be asked to 
complete this scale.  
• Organizational Readiness for Knowledge Translation (OR4KT) Questionnaire: 
At the end of the 12- week field trial , the RD partner  will be asked to complete the 
OR4KT. The OR4KT is a 59- item survey that measures setting- level factors that 
influence program adoption (organizational climate for change, organizational 
contextual factors, organizational willingness to adjust to changes, leadership, 
organizational support, and motivation).53 Subscales are grouped into 6 dimensions: 
1) Organizational climate for change (10 items), 2) organizational contextual factors 
(10 items), 3) Change content (9 items), 4) Leadership (10 items), 5) Organizational support (10 items), and 6) motivation (10 items), followed by 1 open- ended question. 
The validity and reliability of the OR4KT will be assessed in real -life contexts of 
implementation of evidence -based changes in healthcare.
53 Participant partners  will 
not be asked to complete this scale.  
• Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)  69, 70: At baseline and week 12, 
patient partners will be asked to complete the GPAQ  with showcards . The GPAQ is 
a 16- item interview -based questionnaire, where a research staff member will ask 
participants to estimate time spent doing different types of physical activity in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_3711].  The research staff member will use showcards to help the participant 
understand types of activities considered moderate vs. vigorous intensity.  
• Basic  Psychological  Need  Satisfaction  and Frustration  Scale  - Exercise 
(BPNSFS- E)
54: At week  12, patient  partners  and provider  partners  will be asked to 
complete the BPNSFS- E. The BPNSFS- E is a SDT-based  questionnaire.  It assesses 
satisfaction vs. frustration with basic  psychological  needs  for autonomy,  
competence,  and relatedness  with regards  to exercise  through 12 items  (e.g.,  “The 
way I exercise  is in agreement  with my choices  and interests”)  and a five-point  Likert 
scale,  where 1 = “I  don’t  agree at all” and 5 = “I  completely  agree”).  This 24-item 
questionnaire  has demonstrated validity71 and gender  invariance.72  
• Behavioral  Regulations  for Exercise  Questionnaire  (BREQ -3)55: At baseline  and 
week  12, patient  partners  will be asked to complete the BREQ -3. The BREQ -3 is 
SDT-based and provides  separate scores  for each behavioral  regulation for exercise  
(amotivation,  external,  introjected,  identified,  integrated,  and intrinsic).  There  are 24-
Protocol Template  Page 14 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 items  with responses  that range  from 0=”Not  true for Me” and 4=”Very  true for Me.” It 
has demonstrated validity  and reliability.55, 73 
• Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC -IAT)56: At baseline and week 12, 
patient partners will be asked to complete the SC -IAT. The SC -IAT is a 
computerized, time sorting task, which asks participants to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_865038], whether 
each presented PA stimulus belongs to one of two attributes (good/bad).  The SC -IAT 
for physical activity has shown satisfactory internal consistency (i.e., reliability of the 
outcome score of trials within the same test)74, 75 Three scores will be calculated: D-
Score , DW-Score , and IP -Score.  
• Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire (VMIA -2)76: At baseline and week 
12, patient partners will be asked to complete the VMIA -2. The VMIA -2 is a 12- item 
questionnaire where participants rate each mental image in 3 ways (internal visual 
imagery, external visual imagery, and kinesthetic imagery) from 1 (perfectly clear 
and vivid) to 5 (no image at all).  
• Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ -3)77: At baseline and week 12, patient 
partners will be asked to complete the MIQ -3. The MIQ -3 is a 12- item questionnaire 
to assess an individual’s ability to image four movements using internal visual imagery, external visual imagery, and kinesthetic imagery.  
• Internalization of Weight Bias  (WBIS- M): At baseline and week 12, patient 
partners will be asked to complete the WBIS -M. We will measure internalization of 
weight bias using the Weight Bias  Internalization  Scale – Modified (WB IS-M)
57. This 
scale consists of 11 items and uses a 7- point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree; 
7=strongly agree).  WBIS- M has demonstrated high internal consistency and strong 
construct validity. The WBIS -M also demonstrated significant correlations with body 
image, eating pathology, self -esteem, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and 
was associated with these outcomes distinctly from anti -fat attitudes and BMI57. 
• Body dissatisfaction: At baseline and week 12, patient partners will be asked to 
rate their degree of body dissatisfaction.  We will measure this using the Figure 
Rating Scale (FRS) developed by [CONTACT_865058]78. Respondents are asked to 
choose the image that better represents their actual size. Then, they are asked to choose which image represents their ideal body size. The first is considered a 
measure of perception of one's body (current body image); the second is understood 
as an adherence to the ideals of beauty socially shared in the culture to which the respondent belongs (ideal body image). The discrepancy between the two is 
considered a good measure of body dissatisfaction. Positive scores are indicative of 
the desire to have a larger body size, while the negative ones are indicative of the desire to be thinner. The FRS has  indicated good test —retest reliability and 
moderate correlations with other measures of body image dissatisfaction, eating 
disturbance, and overall self -esteem.
79 
• Identity : At baseline and week 12, patient partners will be asked to rate their level of 
agreement for each physical activity identity statement. This will be measured using 
the Behavior Based Identity Questionnaire, which consists of 4 items.  80 
• Physical Activity Habit Strength : At baseline and week 12, patient partners will be 
asked to rate their level of agreement for each physical activity habit  statement. The 
Self-Report  Index  of Habit  (SRHI)  Index  Strength involves  12-items  that assesses 
physical  activity  habit  strength and automaticity81, 82. 
• Dietary Intake Assessment :  Dietary energy and fat intake will be assessed with a 
3-day dietary record. Participants will be asked to log food intake over 3 days 
including a weekend day.  
• Environment: Participants will be asked to report their home address, work address, 
and any changes in these addresses over the 12- week intervention. Home address 
and work address will be used to obtain census level data about the area in which 
they live and work, like access to parks and grocery stores.  
Protocol Template  Page 15 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 • Medication Review:  We will ask patient partners about the medications they are 
taking at baseline and week 12.  
 
Justification and Risks:  These questionnaires are required to assess the primary outcomes of 
acceptability and feasibility and other pre- specified  outcomes of changes in SDT -based constructs  
and additional behavioral and psychosocial outcomes .  Subjects may find it inconvenient to 
complete the surveys.  There are no known risks associated with these procedures.   
 
Additional, Other Pre-Specified  Outcome Measures:  
Anthropometric Measures  
Description:  Body weight will be measured using a digital scale accurate to ±0.[ADDRESS_1206810] 1 mm with a stadiometer at baseline.  Blood 
pressure will be measured with an  automatic sphygmomanometer (average of [ADDRESS_1206811]) at baseline and week 12.  Waist circumference will be measured at baseline 
and week [ADDRESS_1206812].  
 Justification and Risks:  These measures are required to assess our primary study outcomes of 
change in weight and BMI and there are no risks associated with these procedures.    Patterns of PA and Sedentary Behavior  
Description:  The activPALv4 (PALTechnologies, Glasgow, Scotland) will be used to estimate time spent in moderate- to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light activity, and sedentary behavior over a 7- day 
period at baseline and approximately week 12.  The activPAL is a small (23.5 x 43 x 5 mm) and 
light (10 grams) device that uses accelerometer -derived information about thigh position to 
estimate time spent in different body positions (i.e., sitting/lying, standing and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).  The 
device is attached to the anterior thigh and is waterproofed by [CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_10714] a nitrile sleeve.  Thus, it 
can be worn during bathing and overnight, allowing for 24- hour measurement of wake and sleep 
behavior.  The activPAL was used in [CONTACT_857885]’s K23 DK078913 in 114 participants; the device 
was well -tolerated with wear time averaging >23 hours/day
83.  The time- stamped “event” data file 
from the activPAL software will be used to determine time spent sitting, standing, and steppi[INVESTIGATOR_222376].  Using the activPAL program, the event data file will be converted to a second- by-second file 
and additional metrics of sedentary behavior (e.g., breaks in sedentary time, average duration of 
sedentary bouts, sleep time) and time in PA intensity category (sedentary, light and MVPA) will be 
estimated.  The activPAL estimates EE (METs) by 1) assigning MET values to sitting/lying and 
standing events and 2) estimating METs for steppi[INVESTIGATOR_206319].  Many studies have validated the 
activPAL for use in children, adolescents, and adults and report very high levels of accuracy (99-
100%) and no adverse events
84-90.    Participants will also be asked to log all exercise during the 7-
day period they wear the activity monitor.   
 
Justification and Risks:  This measure is necessary to obtain an assessment of patterns of free-
living physical activity, and sedentary behavior.  Subjects may find wearing the monitors 
inconvenient.  Rarely, mild to moderate skin irritation or rash can occur due to the activity monitors.  
If this occurs, the monitor will be discontinued, and the subject evaluated by [CONTACT_9154].   
 
[ADDRESS_1206813] (TMST) 
Description:  A TMST will be obtained as a surrogate measure of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].  In 
accordance with the YMCA TMST protocol58 participants will step on and off a 30.5 cm (12 inch) 
step 24 times per minute for 3 minutes. They will be aided by [CONTACT_865059] 96 
beats per minute which they are to match with 96 steps (24 ascent -descent cycles) per minute. At 
one-minute intervals participants will be told “you are doing well” and the time remaining was 
indicated. Immediately after completion of the test participants rate their perceived exertion using 
the Borg (6 to 20) perceived exertion scale. Their cumulative heart rate will be determined by 
[CONTACT_865060] a stethoscope during the first minute after test completion.  
 
Protocol Template  Page 16 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 Justification and Risks :  The TMST predicts 50- 90% of the variance in fitness as assessed by 
[CONTACT_865061] V02 max testing and is thus an inexpensive surrogate for cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_106387], an important metabolic outcome measure. The TMST is also recommended by [CONTACT_865062].  The primary risks associated with the TMST are likely to be fatigue, shortness of breath, or muscle 
soreness during or after the test.  It is expected that when these symptoms occur, they will be 
minor and brief.  During the TMST there is a small risk subjects may experience musculoskeletal injuries.  During the TMST there is a small risk subjects may trip or fall.  During the TMST is a very 
small risk subjects will experience cardiovascular symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of 
breath, dizziness, syncope, or lower extremity claudication.  Study staff will monitor the test and the test will be stopped if subjects experience any of these symptoms and subjects will be referred to 
their PCP or to the emergency room for further evaluation depending on the severity of symptoms.  
Risks of the TMST will be minimized by [CONTACT_865063]/exclusion criteria.  Subjects will have previously undergone a medical screening including 
medical history interview and physical exam,  and assessment of blood pressure.   
    
D. Potential Scientific Problems:   
 
Making correct inferences when coding qualitative data: There is a risk of making 
incorrect inferences when coding the qualitative data. However, we will use an iterative 
process that involves moving back and forth between raw data and emerging themes 
multiple times, to ensure that participants’ experiences are accurately captured. We use a 
team- based approach to code the qualitative data.  
 Compliance with Move+  Intervention:  We recognize adherence to PA will not be perfect 
and we do not expect it to be.  The research question we seek to address is not whether participants will fully adhere to the Move+  program, but rather whether the Move+  program 
components are acceptable and feasible.  
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
 
F.1 Quantitative Data Analyses: Descriptive statistics will be performed on scale ratings with aspects of the Move+  program. Aspects of the Move+  program with less acceptable 
ratings will be targeted for refinement.
 Average scores <0 for the Net Promoter Score®, or 
<3 on any scale from the PCIS will indicate areas for refinement. Demographic information 
will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.  We will also explore within- person changes in 
other pre- specified outcome measures from baseline to 12 weeks (e.g., PA, weight, waist 
circumference, blood pressure, cardiovascular fitness) using a paired samples t-test. 
Normality assumptions will be evaluated, and transformations used (e.g., square root and log) as appropriate.  P-values <0.05 will be considered significant.  No interim analysis is 
planned.   
 
F.2 Qualitative Data Analyses:  Qualitative data from each cycle  will be transcribed 
verbatim and analyzed using a rapid qualitative analysis approach and a traditional content 
analytical approach. The qualitative data software program ATLAS.ti will be used for data 
organization, management, and analysis. Consistent with established qualitative 
methodology, analysis of interview data will be a continuous, iterative process, beginning with initial data collection and continuing throughout and beyond the data generation 
period.
91-93 We will use a rapid qualitative analysis to understand themes around specific 
domains (acceptability, feasibility, areas for improvement)94. A rapid qualitative analysis 
involves the use of a templated summary to summarize each transcript. Once templated 
summaries are complete, they are further condensed into a matrix to identify key points, 
potential themes, quality and consistency of data collection, directions for further data 
collection and analysis. A rapid qualitative analysis is used to obtain a quick understanding 
of what is in the data. In  addition,  order to achieve immersion, transcripts will be read 
Protocol Template  Page 17 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_1206814] Implementation 
and Sustainability Model (PRISM) and RE -AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 
Implementation, and Maintenance) frameworks95, 96, as well as an inductive, emergent 
approach in order to emphasize respondent perspectives and deemphasize investigator 
speculations93. Each transcript will be coded using a team- based approach (by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Ostendorf  and a trained  Professional Research Assistant ) within ATLAS.ti©.  Initial codes 
will be established, and any questionable codes will be discussed with the study team. We will look for comments/themes of acceptability and feasibility. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_865039], themes, and patterns.
97-99 
 
F.3 Mixed Methods Analyses:  We will use an iterative convergent mixed methods 
design100 to integrate findings from the survey results with qualitative themes to identify 
intervention areas for refinement.  We will look for parallel construc ts/themes, identify 
differences and similarities, and create a joint display to array the integrated results.101, 102  
We will incorporate what we learn from Aim 1 to create a Move+  manual. Our goal is to 
package Move+  in a manner that it is 1) acceptable to participants and organizations to 
and 2) can be feasibly integrated into any existing lifestyle weight management curriculum.  
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:  Over two- thirds of US adults are afflicted with 
overweight or obesity.  Obesity is a serious and increasing public health problem. Physical 
activity is a key modifiable behavior, which may help promote weight loss and weight loss 
maintenance. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_865040], the majority of adults with overweight or obesity do not meet physical activity recommendations. Participants in 
lifestyle interventions typi[INVESTIGATOR_865041], but this adherence steadily declines over time. Although many factors contribute to poor 
physical activity adherence, absence of accessible, effective, theory -based programs that 
account for each person’s values, motivation, and preferences remains a major barrier. 
The proposed study is designed to optimize a theory -based, person- centered physical 
activity program for adults with overweight or obesity. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_865042]. Identifying a feasible physical activity support program for 
adults with overweight or obesity could enhance our ability to treat obesity, as well as 
reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease.  Thus, the minimal 
potential risks to participants are balanced by [CONTACT_865064].

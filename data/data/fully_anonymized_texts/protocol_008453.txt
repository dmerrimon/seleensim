1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Rationale for Hypofractionation  
 
Radiation therapy has a long and established role in the curative tr eatment o f organ -
confine d prostate cancer [1]. However, the optimal radiation dose and treatment 
schedule remain unknown [2]. Typ ically, patients treated with external beam ra diation 
therapy [EBRT] r eceive daily treatment five days per week for a total duration of 7 -8 
weeks [3]. More recently, published non -randomized and randomized data strongly 
suggests that radiation doses in the range of 78 -81 Gy result in an improvement in 
five year bi ochemical freedom from relapse, even in “low r isk (for regional/distan t 
metastasis) patients [4] [5]. Delivery of these doses via highly conformal radiation 
techniques (including conf ormal proton beams) has been associated with m inimal an d 
acceptable si gnificant acute and late treatment -related morbidity. At LLUMC, our 
current institutional standard for early -stage disease is to treat the prostate and 
immediately adjacent paraprostatic  tissues with conformal proton beams alone to a 
radiati on dose of ~81 CGE [Cobalt -Gray Equivalent, in which 1 proton Gy is 
assumed to equal 1.1 photon Gy], delivered over a period of nine weeks. This 
prolonged course, although well tolerated, can lead to l ogistical difficulties in terms 
of requiring p atients ( many of whom re side outside of the immediate area) to remain 
at LLU for periods of up to three months; this can serve as an absolute treatment 
barrier to some patients who would otherwise be candidates  for conformal proton 
beam therapy but who are  unable t o remain at LLU  for such a prolonged treatment 
course. A reduction in treatment time could therefore allow more patients to take 
advantage of this treatment modality that is currently possible.  
 
Radiat ion induced mammalian cell death (including hu man cells ) is classicall y 
described according to the linear -quadratic equation. Per this formula, the survival 
rate of a given cell will depend upon multiple factors including the overall radiation 
dose, the do se per treatment fraction, and the overall tre atment ti me. The dose -
response of tumors and normal tissue to fractionated radiotherapy can be described 
according to the alpha -beta ratio. This ratio is a parameter which numerically 
describes the fractionatio n sensitivity of a particular cell type. For e xample, t he  
ratio is  typi[INVESTIGATOR_483397] ( >10 Gy) for early -responding normal tissues (skin, mucosa) 
and most tumors, and low (< 5 Gy) for late -responding normal tissues (spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], 
brain, bone). An obvious implication of the difference in  ratios between tumor 
and normal tis sue is that it may therefore be possible to increase the “therapeutic 
ratio” by [CONTACT_483399].  
 
Over the last [ADDRESS_621258] been several published reports suggesting that the 
 ratio for prostate can cer cells is  very low and is in fact lower than that for some 
of the surrounding adjacent normal tissues (bladder, rectum) [6] [7]. Although the 
absolute number varies, most publicati ons suggest that the  ratio is between 1 and 
3 [8] [9]. Should this be true, then treatment with hy pofractionat ed regimens (shorter 
overall treatment time, larger treatment fractions) may prove to be more effective 
OSR#[ZIP_CODE]  Phase I -II trial of hypo -fractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy for favorable -risk prostate cancer  
 
   
   3 than conventional fractionation. As will be mentioned below, this hypothesis has 
already been successfully tested in conformal proton beam t reatment of numerous  
malignancies. This protocol is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of 
conformal proton beam therapy of early stage prostate cancer in which treatment is 
administered via a hypofractionated regimen designed to be biological ly equivalen t to 
our current conventional fractionation schemata.  
 
1.2 Hypofractionated Conformal Proton Beam Therapy of other tumors  
 
The use of hypofractionation has a long and generally successful history in conformal 
proton beam therapy. Its use has been p redicated by  [CONTACT_483400] x -rays (i.e., low entrance dose, sharply 
defined high dose area, lack of exit dose) and, until recently, the limited number of 
proton beam treatment centers in existence. Hyp ofractionate d conformal proton beam 
therapy is routinely employed in the treatment of intra -ocular tumors, intra -cranial 
tumors (both benign and malignant), lung cancer, and early breast cancer. It is, 
therefore, reasonable to assume that an analogous leve l of success  can be achieved in 
treatment of organ -confined prostate cancer, and this hypothesis is worthy of testing 
in a Phase I -II clinical trial.  
 
1.3 Calculation of Biologically Equivalent Dose [BED]  
 
In order to facilitate a comparison between our curren t institutio nal standard (81 
CGE/45 Fractions) and the fractionation schedule to be employed in this protocol (60 
CGE/20 Fractions) biologically equivalent doses [BED] will be calculated and the 
isoeffect model using the linear -quadratic equation will be u sed. Also, f or the 
purposes of calculating the BED and isoeffective doses in this protocol two 
underlying assumptions will be made 1) complete repair of radiation -induced DNA 
injury between fractions and 2) there is no time factor. The calculated BED depen ds 
on the as sumed  ratio, which in this protocol will be assumed to be 1.5 for tumor, 
4.0 for rectum (a late responding tissue), and 10 for early responding tissues. The 
assumed  ratio used in each calculation will be indicated by a subscript e.g., BED 
1.5 indicates t hat the BED reported was calculated using an  of 1.5. The calculated 
BED’s for the hypofractionated treatment and our current institutional protocol are as 
follows:  
 
 
               BED 1.5                                  BED 4.0                                 BED 10.0

1.4 Phase I -II Trials of Hypofractionation Regimens in Prostate Cancer  
 
Several reports detailing the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated conformal 
radiation therapy (with x -rays) of prostate cancer can be found in the literature. In the 
[LOCATION_002], Kupelian et al have recently reported five year bNED survival and 
morbidity in a group of patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered 
via an IMRT approach [10]. One hundred patients with organ -confined prostate 
cancer were treated to 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions (2 .5 Gy/fx). Patients were 
treated in 1998, and the median follow up was 66 months. Androgen deprivation 
therapy was administered to 51% of the patients, with the duration of ADT limited to 
no more than six months. The PTV -CTV margin was 4mm posteriorally an d 5-8 mm 
elsewhere. Freedom from biochemical failure was reported using both the ASTRO 
Consensus definition [11] and the RTOG Phoenix definition (nadir + 2 ng/ml). 
Results were reported according to prognostic groups, and the RTOG morbidity 
scoring system was used to report GI and GU morbidity.  
 
The estimated rate of FFBR at five years post -treatment was 85% according to the 
ASTRO definition and 88% per the Phoenix definition. These biochemical results 
were similar to a group of contemporaneously treated patients who were treated with 
3-D CRT to 78 Gy/39 fx. In the hypofractionated patients the combined rate of Grade 
2-3 rectal morbidity was 11% at five years; again, this compares favorably to patients 
treated in a conventional manner to 78 -80 Gy.  
 
LLUMC has treated sixty -two patients with low -risk prostate cancer on a Phase I -II 
hypofractionation trial, in which they received 60 Gy/[ADDRESS_621259] been no Grade >3 complications, and the 
rate of Grade 2 GI/GU morbidity is 1.6%. These toxicity n umbers compare favorably 
with those from our randomized dose -escalation trial and strongly suggest that further 
dose-escalation via hypofractionated techniques is medically feasible.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_621260] been published. The 
Australian Trial compared 64 Gy/32 fx to 55 Gy/20 fx in men with favorable risk 
stage T1 -T2 prostate cancer [12]. The primary trial endpoint was morbidity, and the 
total sample size of 220 patients (110 per arm) was powered to determine a difference 
in the frequency of mild late radiation morbidity of 20% with 90% power. Efficacy 
was conside red to be a secondary endpoint. An interim analysis included the first 120 
consecutively treated men. Median follow up was 43 months (range 23 -62 months). 
Two dimensional EBRT was employed in each arm; no 3 -D or IMRT was used or 
allowed. Morbidity was meas ured with the LENT -SOMA questionnaires. The GI 
component of this questionnaire emphasizes six symptoms (stool frequency, stool 
consistency, rectal pain, mucus discharge, tenesmus, and rectal bleeding). GU 
morbidity measures four symptoms (urinary frequency , urgency, dysuria, and 
OSR#[ZIP_CODE]  Phase I -II trial of hypo -fractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy for favorable -risk prostate cancer  
 
   
   5 hematuria). Treatment efficacy was assessed both clinically and biochemically; the 
latter utilized PSA nadir and three consecutive rises as indications of biochemical 
relapse.  
 
Of the ten symptoms measured only the prevalence of rec tal bleeding at two years 
was different between the two arms, with bleeding reported in 42% of the 
hypofractionated patients vs. 24% in the conventionally treated arm (p<0.05). The 
prevalence of late rectal bleeding in the conventionally treated arm is hig her than 
expected and is most likely due to the two -dimensional methods employed. If one 
only considers those patients experiencing moderate to severe bleeding there is  
no difference  between the arms (20 vs. 14%, P < 0.05). In terms of efficacy, there was  
no difference  in the nadir PSA and the PSA levels 2 years following treatment 
between the arms. Using the ASTRO definition the 4 -year estimated freedom from 
biochemical failure was 85.5% in the conventionally treated arm (BED 10 76.8, BED 
1.5 149.3) and 86 .2% in the hypofractionated arm (BED 10 70.1, BED 1.5 155.8).  
 
Preliminary results of a Canadian randomized trial have also been recently published 
[13]. This trial compares 66 Gy/33 fx (standard arm) to 52.5 Gy/20 fx 
(hypofractionated arm) in patients with low and intermediate risk prostate cancer. 
Dose was prescribed to isocenter and the CTV -PTV margin was 15 mm, except, 10 
mm posterioraly (at investigators discretion). Patients were treated via a four -field 
arrangeme nt and although CT data was used for treatment planning in most patients, 
IMRT was not performed. It must be noted that the two arms were not designed to be 
isoeffective and that the biologically equivalent dose of the short arm is considerably 
less than t he long arm (BED 10 66.3 vs. 79.2, BED 1.5 of 144 vs. 154). It is therefore 
not surprising that the five year failure rate (biochemical or clinical) is higher in the 
hypofractionated arm (59.95% vs. 52.95%, P < 0.05). At a median follow up of 5.7 
years the re is no difference in five year actuarial rate of grade 3+ GI/GU toxicity 
between the two arms.  
  
1.6 Trial Justification  
 
As has been previously described, hypofractionated conformal proton beam radiation 
therapy has become our institutional routine for the treatment of numerous solid 
tumors. Conformal proton beams, by [CONTACT_483401], permit a 
degree of normal tissue sparing that is simply not possible with x -rays [14]. In the 
treatment of prostate cancer, this difference is almost exclusively in the volume of 
normal tissue which  receives a low to moderate radiation dose. This difference may 
and probably does have a profound impact in late normal tissue morbidity as 
radiation -induced late effects are moderated by [CONTACT_483402], 
dose per fraction, and volume of organ receiving any radiation dose. Given the degree 
of normal tissue sparing possible with protons, it is reasonable to assume that results 
achieved with x -ray therapy can be duplicated and quite possibly exceeded (in terms 
of reducing late effects) by [CONTACT_483403] a similar fashion with conformal proton beams. 
Since ample support exists in the medical literature regarding the safety and apparent 
OSR#[ZIP_CODE]  Phase I -II trial of hypo -fractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy for favorable -risk prostate cancer  
 
   
   6 efficacy of hypofractionated prostate cancer treatment via x -rays, it is reasonable and 
desirable to pursue an i dentical strategy with protons.  
 
1.7 Patient Selection  
 
This trial will be restricted to patients with low -risk prostate cancer, defined as Stages 
T1-2C, and Gleason Score 2 -6 and PSA < 10. In this patient population the risk of 
seminal vesicle and lymph invol vement is low enough (< 10%) to permit excluding 
these structures from the treatment volume.  
 
 
1.8 Dose Selection  
 
The hypofractionated dose of 60 CGE/20 Fx has been chosen because, as per the 
linear -quadratic equation (and assuming a BED of 1.5 for prostate c ancer cells) it 
should be isoeffective in terms of biochemical DFS with our current institutional 
standard of 81 CGE/ 45 fractions [4]. In addition, the hypofractionated dose is similar 
to that which has been reported by [CONTACT_483404].  
 
  
2.0 Objectives  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
 
To determine if hypofractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy of prostate 
cancer can result in late RTOG > Grade [ADDRESS_621261] with conventional fractionation 
(81 CGE/45 fx). In PROG 9509, late Gr 2 and Gr3+ GI toxicity was 17 & 1 % 
respectively, Gr2 & Gr3+ GU toxicity wa s 20 & 3%.  
 
 2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
2.2.1.  To determine if hypofractionated conformal proton beam treatment will result 
in local progression (5 -year rate in PROG was 7%), disease -specific survival, 
freedom from biochemical failure (3 -Year Actuarial rat e in PROG was 96% for low 
risk patients, 90% for intermediate/high risk patients), and overall survival (5 year OS 
in PROG was 97%) that are no worse than those achieved with our current 
institutional standard.  
 
2.2.2 . To determine the incidence of acute a nd late GI and GU morbidity treated with 
hypofractionated conformal proton beam treatment.

hormonal therapy would simply confound the impact of hypofractionated 
radiation on bNED survival and freedom from relapse.

11.3.3.  A Bone scan will be performed as clinically indicated e.g., if the patient 
develops a PSA recurrence with a rapid doubling time (< 6 months) or if the

11.3.4 . A needle biopsy is encouraged from the site of original tumor within the 
prostate and/or other sites or within the gland as identified by [CONTACT_483409]/or MRI 
for rising PSA or clinical failures (see Sections 11.5.1 . and 11.6.1 ). 
 
 11.4 Criteria for Biochemical Recurrence  
11.4.1.  Biochemical (PSA) recurrence will be defined as per the new 
RTOG/ASTRO criteria known as the RTOG Phoenix definition: an increase of 
the PSA leve l of at least 2 ng/ml greater than the post -treatment nadir. To ensure 
valid comparisons with our institutional data, the ASTRO Consensus Conference 
definition (three successive > 10% rises in PSA above a nadir) will also be used, 
although this definition will not be the primary definition of biochemical failure.  
 
 11.5 Criteria for Local Recurrence  
11.5.1.  Clinical criteria for local recurrence are progression (increase in size of a 
palpable abnormality) at any time, failure of regression of the palpable t umor by 
[CONTACT_483410] -treatment, and redevelopment of a palpable abnormality after 
complete disappearance of the previously appreciated abnormality. The presence 
of palpable disease must be recorded on the data collection forms for initial and 
follow up p atient evaluations.  
11.5.2  Histologic criteria for local recurrence are presence of prostate carcinoma 
upon biopsy and positive biopsy of the palpably normal prostate > 2 years from 
the end of treatment.  
 
 11.6 Criteria for non -local recurrence . 
11.6.1.  Distant metastasis will be documented if clinical, bone scan, or other 
imaging studies (Prostascint, MRI) demonstrates evidence of its existence. 
Whenever possible, distant metastasis should be documented by [CONTACT_483411]. In addition, TRUS/ biopsy  of the prostate is recommended at the 
time distant metastasis are reported.  
11.6.2.  Regional metastasis will be documented if there is imaging evidence of 
lymphadenopathy and histologic confirmation.

12.1.2.   Three -year actuarial rate of freedom from biochemical failure.  
 
 12.2. Sample Size  
12.2.1. Sample Size  
[IP_ADDRESS] . Phase I Component:   Between [ADDRESS_621271] treated 4260 
patients with early stage prostate cancer (clinical stage T1 or T2, initial PSA <10 
ng/ml, KPS 90 or 100) with protons only. The 3 -year actuarial rectal/urinary 
grade 3 toxicity rate was 0.69% ± 0.15% SE in this cohort. We will 
conservat ively assume the standard toxicity rate 
0p  to be 1% and set the 
unacceptable toxicity rate
1p  at 5%. Statistical error rates will be set at =10% for 
a false positive result (calling the treatment too toxic when it is not) and =10% 
for a false negative result (accepting that the treatment is not too toxic when in 
reality it is) when using a one -sided test of significance. The sample size meeting 
these requirements is 105 patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS] . Phase II Component:    In the same patient cohort, the 3 -year actuarial 
rate of biochemical progression free survival (bPFS) was 96%. We will 
conservatively assume the standard 3 -year biochemical failure rate 
0p  to be 5% 
and set the unacceptable failure rate
1p  at 10%. Statistical error rates for false 
positive and false negative results will again be set at 10%. The required sample 
size is 187 patients, which exceeds the required sample size for the toxicity 
endpoint. An additional 35% will  be added to this number to guard against 
ineligible or inevaluable cases, resulting in 288 patients . In order to be 
conservative the sample size for the Phase I/II study will be set to 300 patients.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assuming we accrue the target goal of 187 eval uable patients, a 5% late 
toxicity rate equates to 9.[ADDRESS_621272] be considered acceptable. This equates to 9 or fewer patients with 
late toxicity, and 12 or fewer patients with recurrence. If the study accrues more 
or less than 187 evaluable patients, these cut -off numbers will be adjusted 
accordingly.  
With a  sample size of 187 patients and an assumed late toxicity rate of 2%, we 
have an upper = 95% confidence limit of 5% for (grade >3) late toxicity. This 
upper bound corresponds to the limit we would accept in terms of toxicity.  
 
 12.3.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_483398] (>=grade 2) in our previously treated patient with early 
stage prostate cancer was less than 15% (12.6% grade 2, 0.8% grade 3) . We wish 
to ensure that the hypofractionation treatment does not increase the acute  toxicity 
rate within the first three months after treatment commenced. The following table

   13 gives the numbers of patients with acute toxicity (>= grade 2) that are considered 
unacceptable at interim check points as calculated by [CONTACT_483412]. For 
example, if there are [ADDRESS_621273] 50 patients entered (and eligible) 
consecutively onto t he trial and not the first [ADDRESS_621274] a 10% 
increase from an assumed 15% toxicity rate to 25%  based on the number of 
patients available at each stage.

12.4 Patient Accrual  
It is projected that there will be approximately a 2 -month period with initial slow 
accrual (5 -10 patients per month) at the beginning of this study to allow for 
establishing t he procedures. After this initial period, it is projected that this study 
will accrue approximately [ADDRESS_621275] to feasibility.  
 
12.5 Analysis Plan  
12.5.1 Interim Analyses of Accrual and Toxicity Data  
• Interim reports will be prepared every six months  until the final analysis. In 
general, the interim reports include information ab out: 
• accrual rate with projected completion date  
• Pre -treatment characteristics of patients accrued  
• frequency and severity of toxicity.  
12.5.2 Analysis and Reporting of Initial Treatment Results  
The analysis to report the initial results of treatment will be undertaken when each 
patient has been potentially followed for a minimum of 15 months. The emphasis 
of this analysis will be on acute toxicity. The usual components of this analysis 
are: 
• patients excluded from the analyses with their reasons for exclusion  
• distribution of the important baseline prognostic variables  
• patient accrual rate  
• observed results with respect to the endpoints described in Section 12.1  
12.5.3 Analysis and Reporting of Final Treatment Results (10/29/01)  
OSR#[ZIP_CODE]  Phase I -II trial of hypo -fractionated conformal proton beam radiation therapy for favorable -risk prostate cancer  
 
   
   14 The analysis to re port the final results of treatment will be undertaken when each 
patient has been potentially followed for a minimum of 3 years. The emphasis of 
this analysis will be on biochemical control. The usual components of this 
analysis are:  
• patients excluded fr om the analyses with their reasons for exclusion  
• distribution of the important baseline prognostic variables  
• patient accrual rate  
• observed results with respect to the endpoints described in Section 12.1.

3. Abstract: 
 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_71517] (LA) is 
widely and very successfully used routinely for perioperati ve pain control in patients 
undergoing major orthopaedic and abdominal surgery si nce [ZIP_CODE] and also at the 
University of [LOCATION_012] (UF).  The routine practice of the  UF Acute Pain Service (APS) is to 
use either ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% without any additives at a  continuous infusion rate of [ADDRESS_77836] of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_71518]’s

parasympathetic ( via the vagus nerve) nervous system. A sympathetic block, inh ibits the 
cardiovascular system and the adrenal cortexes from respo nding appropriately by 
[CONTACT_71587]. This 
sympathelytic blockade is exacerbated by [CONTACT_71588] p arasympathetic tone that 
decreases cardiac output by [CONTACT_71589] a nd heart rate as well as leading to 
more vasodilatation.

 The addition of epi[INVESTIGATOR_71520],  which has been in use for many 
years, has been widely studied and found to be safe. For  example, Niemi et al studied 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_71521] e, fentanyl, with 2mcg/mL epi[INVESTIGATOR_71522]. Niemi dem onstrated that the solution with

 The beneficial role of epi[INVESTIGATOR_71525].  Apart from the humanitarian aspects of e ffectively treating pain and 
suffering, other advantages have been widely studied.  For example, in a large

perioperative cardiac morbidity (~50%), pulmonary inf ections (~40%), pulmonary 
embolism (~50%), ileus (~2 days), acute renal failure (~30%), and blood loss (~30%).3 The 
Multicenter Australian Study of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_71526] (M ASTER) study was another

 A limiting factor in the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187],  however, is the high incidence of 
associated hypotension. Hypotension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 20% 
below the baseline preoperative measurements and acq uired before the epi[INVESTIGATOR_71529].  Effective segmental epi [INVESTIGATOR_71530] t he thoracic or lumbar areas by

 It has been proven beyond doubt that epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], w hen added to ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% 
and used for epi[INVESTIGATOR_71531], is safe a nd may even improve spi[INVESTIGATOR_71532].[ADDRESS_77839] this

either in a pre-operative surgical or anesthetic clinic vi sit or in the pre-operative area on 
the day of surgery. Consent will be obtained by a member of the research team. The 
patient will be given time to read the consent, have all  study related questions 
answered, and discuss the study with their family, if desired . A copy of the signed 
consent will be placed in the patient’s physical chart, and  a research progress note 
documenting study enrollment will be made in the patien t’s electronic medical record.  
 
Inclusion criteria :  
Up to 250 patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years un dergoing epi[INVESTIGATOR_71540] m ajor surgery will be approached 
for their willingness to participate in the study.  Patie nts undergoing major thoracic, 
abdominal, urological or orthopaedic surgery for whom t horacic or lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_71541] (APS) usual and routine practi ce will be included in this

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 05/23/2016_v3 Standard of Care - Preoperative Period:   
All patients will receive a standardized continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_71544]. For the standardized continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_71545], placement will be confirmed 
with loss of resistance technique (LORA), wave form analysis o r nerve stimulation.  .  
 
Patients will receive a bolus of 500 mL of 5% Albumin i ntravenous infusion as per 
the usual routine practice of the APS before the main bolus dose is injected. A 
preoperative level of block will be established that is ap propriate for the surgery by 
[CONTACT_71592][INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% or  lidocaine 2% w/ epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
1:200,000 (5–10 mL) into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_71546] e usual practice of the APS. This 
will be done after the routine test dosing with 3 mL of  2% lidocaine and 1:200,000 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], confirmed that intrathecal and intravascula r markers are negative. If an 
insensate-to-cold area in the appropriate dermatomes ca nnot be established within 10 
minutes following a 5 to 10 mL (maximum 10 mL) injectio n of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5%, the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_71547]. If this process is repeated and there 
was still no level, it will be annotated and the patient  will be removed from the study, 
labeled as a primary block failure, and treated appropr iately by [CONTACT_71593][INVESTIGATOR_71548] a third time or using 
other appropriate perioperative analgesia.  
 
Research-Related Procedures - Preoperative Period:   
Once consent is obtained, patients will be randomly allocat ed by [CONTACT_22123]-
generated randomization to one of four groups.  This will be a quintuple blinded 
prospective study. The anesthesiologist managing the intr aoperative anesthesia, the 
anesthesiologists (APS) placing the blocks and following th e patients on the floors, the 
research nurse taking the measurement, the surgeons, nor  the patients will be aware of 
what combination of drugs are used for the epi[INVESTIGATOR_71549].  
The three groups will consist of:  
1. Group A (Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% infusion; Control group)  
2. Group B (Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% + 2 mcg/mL epi[INVESTIGATOR_238])

The pharmacists will make up and supply test drugs for gr oups A, B and C and 
provide them labeled to the block area drug dispenser as  “A, B, or C test solutions” 
without specifically identifying the content. 
 
Immediately following the establishment of an appropria te level for the planned 
surgery, an infusion of the test drug will be initiated at 4 to 8 mL per hour with a 4- to 8-
mL patient-initiated bolus at a lockout interval of 1 h our – typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 8 mL per hour for 
major abdominal or thoracic surgery and thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_71550] 4 mL per hour

situation, this infusion will be left unchanged througho ut the surgery and postoperative 
period. If clinically indicated, and the infusion rate i s changed above these limits, the 
patient will be removed from the study. If the infusion  is changed to below the limits of 4

Intraoperative and postoperative fluid management will be at the discretion of the 
anesthesia and primary teams.  
 
Preoperative sedation will be a maximum of 5 mg of mid azolam by [CONTACT_71594] (IV) and alfentanil 2000 mcg IV. Monitors in clude: EKG, non-invasive blood

Data analysis plan 
 
All data will be entered securely using the online data base or Red Cap.  To 
assess potential dose-response effects on changes in continuou sly measured primary 
outcomes, repeated measures mixed modeling analyses will be used. This type of 
analysis can assess the main effects of time (i.e., change) a nd group (i.e., epi[INVESTIGATOR_71565]; coded as an ordinal variable) on the outcomes. Mixed  models are the preferred 
approach to analyze data with repeated measures; these models can account for

missing data. Additionally, this model can estimate time  × group interactions. If this 
interaction is statistically significant, that provides evide nce that the changes in 
outcomes are different depending on the dose of epi[INVESTIGATOR_71566] a patient received.  
Logistic regression models will be used to assess the relatio nship between epi[INVESTIGATOR_71567] (SBP < 20% or MAP < 55  mmHg) and other 
categorical outcome variables. A P value of <0.05 was conside red statistically 
significant for all statistical tests.  All analyses were condu cted in JMP Pro 11.0 (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC).   
 
    Sample size determination  
At 80% power (alpha = 0.05), a sample of n=200 (50 pe r group) will be able to 
detect 26% differences in incidence of categorical outcom es, and an effect size of 
Cohen’s f = 0.[ADDRESS_77850] si ze of Cohen’s f = 0.[ADDRESS_77851] deviations in outcomes ranging from 
5 to 25. For example, assuming MAP has an SD = 10, the p resent study will be able to

mean change over time.

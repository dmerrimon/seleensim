In the Ad Hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) study (Presented at the SCAI meeting, 
2015 ), 100 patients with troponin -negative acute coronary syndrome were randomized to receive 
ticagrelor (180mg loading dose [LD] and 90mg afte r 12hr) or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (600mg LD and 75 mg 
after 12 h) with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 75 –100mg daily. P2Y12 reactivity uni t [PRU] using VerifyNowTM assay was 
measured pre -LD, and at 0.5, [ADDRESS_139419] LD. At 2 h, PRU was lower with ticagrelor vs. 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (98.4 ± 95.4 vs. 257.5 ± 74.5, respectively; p<0.001). PRU  diverged as early as [ADDRESS_139420] ticagrelor LD and there was  a significant reduction in the PRU level with ticagrelor . The r ate 
of hig h on -treatment PRU level was  significantly reduced with ticagrelor compared with 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_16367] 2 h (13.3% vs . 78.3%, respectively ; p<0.001). However, ticagrelor still did not cover 
the first 30 min of the procedure.  
 
The Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen –Rapid Early Action for Coronary 
Treatment (ISAR -REACT) study reported  that pretreatment with [ADDRESS_139421] rategy of pretreatment w ith the addition of abciximab 
[1] However, an important consideration in the decision for pretreatment is the associated risk of 
bleeding in those patients requiring coronary by[CONTACT_4897].  The Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123930] w ith 
Eptifibatide  to Arrest the Reactivity of Platelets  (CLEAR PLATELETS study ) [2] showed  that the 
administration of eptifibatide with either a [ADDRESS_139422] to bleeding complications 
after PCI, adopting a bolus injection or brief infusion of glycopr otein inhibitors ( GPI) has reduced 
such complications. In this respect, Kini et al [3] demonstrated that among patients undergoing 
PCI, GPI  [INVESTIGATOR_123931]/bleeding complications with similar MACE and reduced 
cost when compared with GPI [INVESTIGATOR_123932] p lus continuous infusion. In addition, GPI [INVESTIGATOR_123933].  Marmur et al. [4] compared long-term 
mortality after bolus only administration of abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban during PCI and 
demonstrated t hat eptifibatide, when given as bolus -only during PCI, improved the long -term 
survival compared to abciximab. Furthermore, Fung et al. [5] demonstrated that in patients 
undergoing non -emergent PCI, the post -procedural infusion of eptifibatide  can be abbrev iated to 
<[ADDRESS_139423]-Segment Myocardial I nfarction ( NSTEMI ) to 
ticagrelor 190 mg loading and eptifibatide bolus -only (TEP) vs. ticagrelor loading and eptifibatide 
bolus plus 2 h infusion  (TEPI) administrated before stenting  [Fig. 1] . Light transmission 
aggregometry wa s performed and percent inhibition of platelet aggregation ( %IPA ) was calculated 
at baseline, and at 2 , 6 , and 24 h using ADP,TRAP, collagen, and arachidonic acid (AA). Cardiac 
enzymes, hemoglobin and hematocrit were measured at baseline and at 24 h. The  event rates 
were determined at 30 -day follow -up. We demonstrated that in patients randomized to TEP vs. 
TEPI, there were no significant difference in the %IPA values at 2 h and 6 h with ADP 5  μM (100% 
± 0.01 vs. 99% ± 0.25 and 99% ± 2.4 vs. 99% ± 1.2, res pecti vely) and with ADP 20 μM as well as 
with collagen. However, %IPA was lower at 24 h (still >60 % platelet inhibition ) compared with that 
at 2 h and 6 h. Percent IPA with TRAP 10 or 20 μM was higher at 6 h in patients randomized to 
 3 
TEPI [INVESTIGATOR_123934]. TEP (87% ± 13  vs. 74% ± 17; P<0.01, respectively), but t his had no bearing on outcomes 
since ADP was highly inhibited by [CONTACT_123960] 6 h. There were no significant differences in 
troponin or hemoglobin levels among the groups. During follow - up, and there was no sten t 
thrombosis or myocardial infarction.  
 
 
We concluded that % IPA values with ADP and collagen were not significantly different comparing 
ticagrelor with eptifibatide bolus only vs. ticagrelor and eptifibatide bolus plus [ADDRESS_139424] of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123935], variable, and irreversible; approximately 15 
to 30% o f patients are non -responsive [6 ]. Furthermore, a 75 -mg/d clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123936] 5 days, and a 600 -mg loading dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123937] 8 hours to 
achieve a 50% steady state of inhibition of ADP -induced platelet aggregation [7 -9]. The difference 
in the clinical effects of ticagrelor compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123938], more potent, and more consistent inhibition of platelets  [10,11 ].  In the CLEAR

PLATELETS study [2],  administration of eptifibatide with either a [ADDRESS_139425] incidence of 
myonecrosis compared with 600 mg loading dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123939] . 
The Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes ( PLATO ) trial [12] demonstrated that d ual 
antiplatelet therap y with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_123940] d ticagrelor was  superior to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_123941] . Glycoprotein 
IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) bolus and infusion was used wit h ticagrelor in 40% of patients in the PLATO 
trial. However, GPI [INVESTIGATOR_123942]. 
On the other hand, the CLEAR PLATELET study showed clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123943] e ptifibatide bolus and 
infusion was associated  with reduced myonecrosis . In addition, they  showed that platelet 
inhibition was significantly higher with 600 mg vs. 300 mg of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] . In the Ad Hoc PCI study, 
ticagrelor or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123944] a significant reduction in the PR U level with ticagrelor  as compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. We 
demonstrated that %IPA with ticagrelor and eptifibatide bolus was not significantly different than 
ticagrelor and eptifi batide bolus and short infusion.  
The inhibition of platelets  is significantly faster and stronger with Ticagrelor than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745].  W e 
hypothesi zed that inhibition of platelet aggregation with ticagrelor alone will be non -inferior to that 
of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123945]. The present study wi ll be the first to in vestigate the 
pharmacodynamic  effects of ticagrelor vs. clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123946] . If 
ticagrelor alone is indeed non -inferior to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] a nd eptifibatide bolus, this will pave the way 
for a large randomized study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of ticagrelor alone as 
compared with concomitant administration of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123947].  
Study Hypothesis: To compare  the percent inh ibition of platelet aggregation with ti cagrelor 
compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123948] -negative unstable angina.  
 
Inclusion Criteria :  
Patients with s table angina with evidenc e for at least >10% per fusion defect (moderate to large  
ischemia ) or patients with t roponin -negative  unstable angina .  
 
Exclusion Criteria: A need fo r oral anticoagulation therapy; an increased risk of bradycardia, 
and concomitant therapy with a strong cytochrome P -450 inhibitors;  surgery<4 weeks; The use 
of any thienopyridine s prior to randomization ; upstream use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors;  
bleeding diathesis or major bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] w ithin 2 weeks; thrombocytopenia ; incessant chest 
pain; hemodynamic instability; NSTEMI as evidenced by [CONTACT_123961]; renal fai lure 
with a serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL; and anemia with HCT<30% . 
 
Methods    
In this study, [ADDRESS_139426] -
loading dose, 2 h, and 4  h, and 24 h . All patients w ill be started on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 81 mg  prior to procedure  
. Heparin 60 units/kg will be administered  intravenously before PCI. PCI will be performed in 
accordance with standard clinical practice. Please see Fig. 2, Design of the study below and Table

Blood Sampling for Platelet Function Testing  
Blood will be collected from  an antecubital vein into vacutainer tubes (Becton -Dickinson, Franklin 
Lakes, NJ) that contain 3.2% trisodium citrate for l ight-transmittance aggregometry. All 
measurements will be performed at the UAB thrombosis research laboratory.  
 
Light -Transmittance Aggregometry  
Platele t aggregation induced by [CONTACT_123962] (5 and 20  m), TRAP (10 and 20 m) platel et-rich plasma 
will be measured with a Chrono log Optical Agg regometer (m odel 490 -4D; Chrono log Corporation, 
Havertown, Pa). The final extent of aggregation, measured at [ADDRESS_139427] addition, 
and the maximal extent of aggregation will be expressed as the percent change in lig ht 
transmittance from baseline with plate let-poor plasma as a reference. Inhibition of platelet 
aggregation (IPA) will be  calculated as follows:  
  
IPA(%)=100% X PAt - PAb 
PAb 
Where PA is platelet aggregation, b is predosing, and t is postdosing.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
The present study is an exploratory trial to investigate the percent inhibition of platelet activity 
(%IPA) (measured by [CONTACT_60230]-transmittance aggregometry)  comparing the loading dose of ticagrelor 

 6 
with loading dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123943] 2 boluses of eptifibati de measured at all time -points.  Since 
there are no preliminary data available, no power calculation was performed. Statistical analysis 
will be performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 22.0, software 
package for Windows (SPSS, I nc., Chicago, Illinois). Data will be presented as mean ± 1 SD or 
frequencies; a value of P< 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. %IPA  of ticagrelor and 
[ADDRESS_139428] will be performed.   
 
End-Points  
The primar y end point of the study is to compare %IPA induced by [CONTACT_123963] [ADDRESS_139429] loading dose. Secondary endpoints of the study  are to 
compare %IPA induced by [CONTACT_123964][INVESTIGATOR_123943] 2 boluses of eptifibatide   at all time -points.   Other secondary 
outcomes include: 1) the occurrence of post -procedural myonecrosis comparing the [ADDRESS_139430] -procedure troponin -1 level >0.26 µg/l; and 
2) the rate minor  (a fall in hemoglobin of 3 to <5  g/dL) and major bleeding  ( a fall in the hemoglobin 
>5 g/dL)  between the groups . 
 
Anticipated Findings   
Since platelet inhibition with ticagrelor starts rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], we expect that %IPA  at [ADDRESS_139431] that %IPA at 24 h will be higher with ticagrelor than clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123949].  
We anticipate the results of the present study will set the stage for a large randomized tria l 
comparing myonecrosi s, stent thrombosis, death, myocardial infarction, bleeding, and costs in 
patients randomized to ticagrelor onl y vs. loading dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_123943] 2 boluses of eptifibatide .

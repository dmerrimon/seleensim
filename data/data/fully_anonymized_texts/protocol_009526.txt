This statistical analy sis plan (SAP) documents the statistical methodology  and data 
analysis algorithms and conventions to be applied for statistical anal ysis and reporting of 
efficacy  and safet y data of trial31-10-270.  The first approved protocol, dated 30 Mar 
2010, and its amendments (amendment 1 -23 Nov 2010, amendment 2 -08 Apr 2013, 
amendment 3 -11 Apr 2013, amendment 4 -08Jul2015 )are taken into consideration in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_839919].   
2 Trial Objective s
2.1 Primary Objective
Tocontinue to provide aripi[INVESTIGATOR_839920] (IM) Depot treatment (400 mg or 300 
mg) to subjects with schizophrenia completing the 52 -week, open -label safety  and 
tolerability  trial31-08-248 (hereafter referred to as trial248).  Subjects can receive this 
treatment until aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] I M Depot is commercially  available in an y dosage [including 
generic formulation (s)]in the country  that the trialis being conducted or until the trial
end date of [ADDRESS_1167398] long -term safety  data on aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] I M 
Depot in addition to what was collected in trial 248 (52-weeks).   
[ADDRESS_1167399] who discontinued or did not complete trial 248 are allowed to 
enroll in this trial.The trialdesign is presente d in Figure 3 -1and Figure 3 -2.
Eligible subjects enter this trialdirectly  after completing the end of treatment visit ( week 
52) of trial [ADDRESS_1167400] trialvisit for trial 
248serve as the baseline evaluations for this trial.  Subjects continue to receive 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_839921] a continuation of their previous monthly  dose in 
trial 248 .  The monthly  dose can be modified, either reduced from 400 mg to 300 mg to 
address tolerability  or increased from 300mg to 400mg to address efficacy , at the 
discretion of the investigator.
Following the baseline visit, subjects receive monthly  injections and at the same visit, 
adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications arerecorded and the Columbia 
Protocol 31 -10-270 Statistical Analysis Plan

childbearing potential (WOCBP).  Every  6 months, al l of the 3 -month assessments are 
completed along with the Clinical Global I mpression -Severit y (CGI -S) scale, vital signs, 
and extrapy ramidal s ymptoms (EPS) assessments (including the Abnormal Involuntary  
Movement Scale [AIMS], Simpson -Angus Scale [SAS], and Barnes Akathisia Rating 
Scale [BARS]).  At the [ADDRESS_1167402] 
circumference.  
Urine drug screening a nd blood alcohol t esting are obtained at baseline and can be re -
obtained at the investigator’s discretion at an y time during the trial.  A Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS) for subject -reported rating of pain at the most recent injection site and the 
investigator’s assessment for p ain, redness, induration, and swelling of the mo st recent 
injection site are performed at baseline and may  be reassessed at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Clinical laboratory  tests, phy sical examination, and electrocardiogram 
(ECG) obtained at baseli ne may  also be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
based on clinical necessity .  
A Trial Completion visit or Earl y Termination visit ( −2/+10 days) include s the following 
assessments: C -SSRS, AEs, concomitant medications, a urine pregnancy  test for 
WOCBP, CGI -S, vital signs, EPS assessments (AIMS, BARS, SAS), clinical laboratory  
tests, and body  height and weight.
A [ADDRESS_1167403] Treatment Follow -up phone call ismade 30 day s (3days) after it has 
been determined that the subject no longer partic ipate s in this trialand include squestions 
about an y AEs that have occurred and an y concomitant medications taken since the last 
visit
The subject population iscomprised of subjects who have completed Trial 248 and in the 
investigator’s judgment may  benefit from continued participation in an aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] I M 
Depot trial, in countries where aripi[INVESTIGATOR_839922]. It is 
anticipated that 500 to 800 subjects from estimated 250 sites in trial 248 enroll in this 
trial.

in this trialis approximately 500 to 800.
5 Statistical Method
5.1 Data /Data Sets Specifications
5.1.1 Data Sets A nalyzed
The following anal ysis samples are defined for this trial:
Enrolled Sample:  All subjects who sign the informed consent sform for the trial
and enter the trial.
Safety  Sample:  All subjects who receive at least one dose of open -label
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552].   
Efficacy  Sample:  All subjects who enter and have at least one post -baseline 
efficacy  evaluation.
  
Due to the open -label single -arm nature of the trial, all endpoint swill be summarized 
using descriptive statistics . Continuing variables will be tabulated for f requency , mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), maximum and minimum . Categorical variables will be
tabulated for frequency  and percentage .  No formal statistical analy ses are planned due to 
the open -label nature of this trial.  Subjects w ho enrolled in this trialrolled over directly
from Trial 248. Subjects who enrolled in Trial 248 either rolled over from Trial 31 -07-
246 or Trial 31 -07-247, or directl y entered Trial 31 -08-248 as de novo subjects ( i.e., 
subjects never enrolled in Trial 31 -07-246 or 31 -07-247). The data will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_839933] 248as well for all subjects.

5.5.4 Electrocardiograms (ECG) Data
All ECG analy ses are made using observed data. Baseline is defined as average of ECG 
measurements at baseline visit as specified in Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_1167409] visit as spe cified in Section 5.1.2 .  
Missing ECG data are not imputed.  For the calculation of QT correction b y heart rate, 
QTcis missing only  if all 3consecutive beats are unreadable.  As long as there is at leas t
1 beat available in the le ad, the data are included in the anal ysis. For each ECG, QT and 
RR intervals from three consecutive complexes (representing three consecutive heart 
beats) are measured manually .  The QT correction is performed on beat -to-beat basis.  
The mean of ratios (be at-to-beat) is calculated b y (QTc1 + QTc2 + QTc3)/3 using each

panel in the CRF. The AIMS movement rating score (range 0 to 28) isthe sum of the 
rating sc ores for facial and oral movements (items 1 to 4), extremity  movements (items 5 
and 6), and trunk movements (item 7). A missing value of an y item for the SAS or the 
AIMS movement scale could result in a missing SAS total score or AIMS movement 
rating score . The BARS global score (range 0 to5) isderived from the global clinical 
assessment of akathisia from the BARS panel in the CRF. Mean changes from baseline 
on the SAS total score, AIMS movement score, and the BARS global score will be
summarized by  [CONTACT_839942].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Suicidality
Upon administration of the Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
assessments, each subject is evaluated for active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent. Data collected from t he C-SSRS assessment swill be summarized by [CONTACT_839943] y sample reporting suicidal ity;suicidal behavior onl y, emergence of 
suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation only , emergence of suicidal ideation, emergence of 
serious suicidal ideation, and worsening o f suicidal ideation.  
Suicidality  is defined as reporting any  suicidal ideation or behavior. Suicidal behavior 
only is defined as reporting an y type of suicidal behavior s(actual attempt, interrupted 
attempt, aborted attempt and preparatory  acts or behav ior) throughout assessment period. 
Emergence of suicidal behavior is defined as having no suicidal behavior at baseline and 
reporting an y type of behavior at post -baseline.   Suicidal ideation only  is defined as 
reporting an y type of suicidal ideation.  Em ergence of suicidal ideation is defined as 
having no suicidal ideation at baseline and reporting an y type of ideation during 
treatment.  Emergence of serious suicidal ideation is defined as having no suicidal 
ideation at baseline and reporting serious suic idal ideation with score of 4 or 5 on suicidal 
ideation severit y rating during the treatment.  At suicidal ideation severit y rating
assessment, each person is giving a score of 0 (no ideation present) to 5 (active ideation 
with plan and intent).  Worsening of suicidal ideation is defined as having more severe in 
most severe suicidal ideation rating at post baseline than at baseline. Numbers of 
subject s reporting suicidal behavior will be reported by  [CONTACT_839944].  
Protocol [ADDRESS_1167413] getsthe intensity  score from 0 (none) to 5(worst) .  Therefore, suicidal 
ideation intensity total score is range from [ADDRESS_1167414] did not endorse an y 
suicidal ideation, a score of 0 is given for the intensity  scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site Reaction and Pain
Injection site reaction and pain areassessed every 6 months in the visual analogue scale 
(VAS )score (range 0 -100mm) before and after IM depot injection at the scheduled visit .  
Descriptive statistics for VAS score will be tabulated by [CONTACT_839945].  
Assess ment pre 1st IM depot injection is used as baseline.  Proportions of subject s rated 
as absent, mild, mo derate and severe level b y the investigator for localized pain, redness, 
swelling, and induration will be tabulated by [CONTACT_839946] .  In an addition, 
descriptive statistics for i njection site reaction and pain areprovided by  [CONTACT_839947].  
5.5.7 Other Data A nalysis
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medication
Proportions of subjects from the enrolled sample taking concomitant medications will be
tabulated b y drug classification using the WHO drug prior to taking trialmedication , in 
the trialperiod and in the follow -up period , respectively .  
Proportions of subjects taking concomitant medications such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_839927]. Concomitant medications for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_839928], 
respectivel y, using the appropriate conversion factors. Daily dose of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(lorazepam or equivalent) and anticholinergic (benztropi[INVESTIGATOR_92652]) concomitant 
medications will be summarized.  Daily  dose for each subject is calculated in total dosage 
of the specific concomitant medications divided by [CONTACT_839948].
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Exposure to Trial Medication
Exposure to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_839929], average dose level per injection and average 
trialday of receiving each injection . In an addition, percentage of subjects will be
presented b y dosing level per injection .

Page 19of [IP_ADDRESS] Compliance of Trial Medication
To maintain subjects on a schedule within acceptable time window is critical for subjects 
to achieving and maintaining stability  of ps ychotic sy mptoms for the completion of this 
depot trial.  A missed dose of IM depot is defi ned as a lapse of>38 day s between 
injections. The minimum interval of 26 days and maximum interval of 38 day s between 
injections is to ensure that therapeutic plasma concentrations of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_839930]. Compliance of trialmedication ( aripi[INVESTIGATOR_839931]) will be summarized 
for the enrolled sample , in proportion of subjects having 100% compliance, along with 
thefollowing key  features of compliance :
the intervals between Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] I M depot injections <26 day s;
missing at least 1 injection ;
missing 2 consecutive injections at an y time in the trial;
missing 3 injection swithin a 52-week time period.

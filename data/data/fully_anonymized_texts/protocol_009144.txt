SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol IM140103
Protocol Title: Open Label, Adaptive Design, Ascending, Multiple- Dose Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of 
BMS -986004 in Adult Subjects with Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):   Total of 40 subjects will be enrolled for the study, treated in dose panels of 10 subjects each. Four (4) 
dose panels are planned to be enrolled sequentially in an ascending manner , with dose intensity selected to provide 
increased levels of immunosuppression at steady state. Dose levels that are planned to be evaluated in this trial are 
expected to elicit a range of clinical response. Based on current preclinical projections, the doses range from [ADDRESS_794844] on Day 1/Week 0, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12, for a total of 7 
doses. 
During the long term extension (LTE) period, BMS -986004 will be administered once every 2 weeks as an IV 
infusion for 24 w eeks and during 2 Taper visits.
Study Phase: Phase 1b/2
Research Hypothesis: Because current study is an open label trial without placebo control, there is no formal 
research hypothesis to be statistically validated. The purpose of this study is to test if BMS -986004 w ill be effective 
in normalizing platelet counts in subjects with ITP, as well as to assess the safety, PK and immunogenicity of 
multiple doses of BMS -986004 in ITP subjects.
Prim ary Objectives:
To assess the overall safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BMS -986004, when administered in subjects 
with chronic ITP.
Secondary objectives: 
To evaluate efficacy of BMS-986004 in the treatment of throm bocy topenia in subjects with chronic ITP, as 
measured by [CONTACT_600213]/complete response (R/CR) and other clinical parameters. 
To establish BMS -986004 dose response, as measured by [CONTACT_600214].
To measure the target engagement of BMS -986004 follow ing multiple IV doses
To assess the effect of BMS-986004 on markers associated with the risk of throm boembolism (TE) in the 
multiple dose setting
To assess pharmacokin etics and immunogenicity of multiple doses of BMS -986004 in subjects with chronic 
ITP

BMS-986004 anti-cd40l dab
Long T erm Extension Period Objective :
To assess the long term clinical safety, tolerability and efficacy of BMS -986004 . 
Study Design:   This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, dose response, 
and pharmacology (PK, target engagement and PD) of BMS -986004 in subjects w ith ITP. 
The study will comprise a short -term period and a long -term extension (LTE) period. 
The short -term period, is divided into three phases: Response Phase (6 weeks), Remission Phase (6 weeks) and 
Follow  Up phase (8 weeks).
Screening evaluations to determine subject eligibility will be performed [ADDRESS_794845] dose. To be eligible for enrollment, platelet count needs to be 
less than 30,000/ mm3and show  stable or declining trend. If the mean platelet count is betw een 30,000 -35,000/ 
mm3the subject may be considered for enrollm ent on a case by [CONTACT_600215] .
Follow ing screening, a total of [ADDRESS_794846] 4 doses of study drug and complete the required safety and efficacy evaluations at Day 50. 
Non-evaluable subjects will be replaced to maintain a count of 10 subjects in each dose panels, except subjects will 
not be replaced if they are discontinued from the study secondary to an adverse event unless the adverse event can 
be determined to be unrelated to treatment .
Subjects are treated in dose panels of 10 subjects each. Four (4) dose panels are planned to be enrolled sequentially 
in an ascending manner, with dose intensity selected to provide increased levels of immunosuppression at steady 
state. Dose levels (range from 75 mg to 1500 mg administered every two weeks) that are planned to be evaluated in 
this trial are expected to elicit a range of clinical response. 
BMS -986004 w ill be administered once every 2 weeks as an IV infusion for a total of 7 doses. Four (4) doses will be 
administered during the Response Phase over a [ADDRESS_794847] on Day 1/Week 0 , Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 12, for a total of 7 
doses. 
Each dose cohort will enroll 10 new subjects, starting with the respective dose level at Day1/Week 0, regardless of 
the number of subjects joining a dose cohort because of intr a-subject dose escalation. 
A new cohort may be opened to treat subjects at a dose lower than [ADDRESS_794848] 6 subjects treated at the 75 mg 
cohort achieve platelet Response (R) (platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3and at least 2-fold increase from the baseline
count and absence of bleeding) , at the end of response phase (Week 6). The new cohort would follow the same 
schedule as the other cohorts including intra -subject dose escalation.
The Long- term  extension (LTE) period is optional and will include eligible subjects (defined as subjects from 
either cohort 3 or cohort 4 who complete 12 w eeks (85 -days) of treatment and who achieve a response as defined by 
[CONTACT_2669] a doubling of platelets from Short Term  Day 1 baseline and a platelet count of ≥ 35,000/mm3. If a subject 
has platelet counts close to a doubling of platelets and/or betw een 30,000 -35,000 platelets/ mm3, the subject may be 
considered for the long term extension on a case by [CONTACT_413], which will involve a review of data from the short 
term period and w hich will require approval by [CONTACT_600216].
Intra -subject dose escalation
Intra -subject dose escalation could occur after the subject has completed the Response Phase of the study. Subject 
will receive the next higher dose of BMS -[ADDRESS_794849] two consecutive counts performed at Day 43 and Day 50, and a favorable

safety profile is observed. Clinically significant response is defined as achieving platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3with 
an increase of at least 20,000/mm3from baseline and absence of bleeding. Subject will then be dosed at the higher 
dose level for the remainder of the study (Remission Phase).

in the section of early decision of dose escalation for dose panel.
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_600201]. 
Dose escalation to the next planned dose will not proceed if any of the following criteria are met (Adverse event 
grading as defined by [CONTACT_600218] [CTCAE, Version 4.0]):
Five or more subjects in a cohort have platelet counts >450,000/mm3for non-splenectomized subjects and 
>600,000/mm3for subjects who underwent splenectomy, and platelet count raise is not attributable to a rescue 
or concom itant therapy.
Two or more subjects have serious adverse events in the same organ system (Grade 3 and above), that are 
determined to be related to study medication
It is determined that the limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached. This decision will be made 
following discussions betw een the Study Team and the Investigator
If any of the above criteria are met within a dose level, the progression to a higher dose level will be put on hold and 
all safety data available across the study will be evaluated to estimate the risk of proceeding to the higher dose level. 
The review will include all of the subject(s) that experienced SAEs listed above. In addition, data set may include 
subjects from a dose panel, the entire dose panel, or if appropr iate, all randomized subjects treated to date. 
In addition, decision may be made following discussions betw een the Study Team  and the Investigator to halt dose 
escalation for reasons not defined above, including but not limited to, observing a single serious adverse event in 
individual subjects, observ ing trends in a given dose panel and across dose panels, and/or it is determined that the 
limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached. 
If dose escalation is stopped due to any  of these findings, additional cohorts may receive the same or low er do ses of 
the investigational compound.
At the time of dose escalation, dose levels of new cohorts may be adjusted to lower doses if the accumulated safety 
data so dictates.
Adaptive dose selection may be performed to adjust some pre-selected doses, e.g., thethird or/and fourth cohort 
doses, using accumulated efficacy and dose or exposure data. Models based on response rate, such as but not limited 
to (Bayesian) logistic regression, (Bayesian) EMax model, may be utilized to predict a dose satisfying certain

Early Decision of Dose escalation for dose panel
When a cohort is filled and a new subject is available to be treated, an early decision can be made on whether to 
open the next higher cohort if not all the subjects have completed the evaluation period. The early decision rule is 
based on controlling the probability of making a wrong early decision, called decision risk, to be at most 15%. 
Detailed information on deriving the decision risk is included in Appendix 1. 
The early decision rule is based on the largest number of subjects who developed AE of interest which is drug-
related SAE within the same organ system at grade [ADDRESS_794853] the lower dose cohort when more events are observed at the lower cohort, 
decision will be made upon agreement f rom both investigators and sponsor after considering all safety data.
Three count numbers are used by [CONTACT_600219].
Titration -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nH): the number of subjects who are titrated and comp lete the evaluation 
period (2 w eeks) starting from the first titration dose (on day 43).
Start -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nL): the num ber of subjects who develop drug related SAE at grade 3 or higher 
or complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) from the first dose (on day 1) buthaven’t completed the [ADDRESS_794854] titration dose (on day 43) if being titrated to a higher dose.

Subjects with AE of Interest (k): the largest number of subjects who developed drug related SAE within the 
same organ system at grade [ADDRESS_794855] dose of BMS -986004 till 
the decision making day. The value of k is allowed to be either 0 or 1. Note that it doesn’t distinguish at which 
stage of treatment, prior to or post titration, tha t such AE happened.
Minim um Requirement for Cohort Escalation
A set of minimum safety requirement, as listed below , must be met in order to make an early decision.
There must be at least 5 (nL+nH>=5) safety evaluable subjects (with safety data through stu dy Day 15)
A higher dose than the new cohort’s start dose must be shown tolerated in the IM140 -002 study.
Early Decision Rule:
If there is not AE of interest observed, the early decision rule is the same as the minimum requirements.
If there is one AE of interest observed, the early decision rule is shown in Table 3.1.[ADDRESS_794856] cannot be treated at the next 
higher cohort.
Study Population:  
Male and Female subjects ≥18 years old with persistent or chronic ITP according to American Society of 
Hem atology (ASH), with or without prior splenectomy guidelines will be eligible to participate in the study. 
Wom en of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must not be nursing or pregnant and must be using an acceptable 
method of contraception for at least 4weeks before dosing. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 
hours prior to dosing with study medication

Study Assessments:  
Safety Outcome Measures:  Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and 
the results of vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. The 
incidence of observed adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical 
importance.
Efficacy Assessments: Response (R) -platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3and at least 2-fold incre ase from the 
baseline count and absence of bleeding, or Complete response (CR) -platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3and absence 
of bleeding, or Overall response rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a CR or R.
Pharm acokinetic Measures: Pharmacokinetic param eters (Cmax, Ctrough), will be derived from serum 
concentration versus time
Biomarker Measures:  CD40L receptor occupancy and free soluble CD40L will be measured to determine target 
engagement. Total soluble CD40L will be measured as a potential PD biomarker. Platelet -associated anti-

(PBMCs) will be purified from whole blood and analyzed by  [CONTACT_600220]/or if leukocyte phenotypes are affected by [CONTACT_600221]. 
Plasma molecules that may be associated with the disease or drug target pathway, including cytokines and 
chemokines, will be measured. The prim ary safety biomarkers, d-Dimer and Throm bin anti-Throm bin(TAT), 
will be monitored to evaluate risk of throm boem bolism. Exploratory safety biomarkers to monitor possible 
effects on protective immunity will include immune cell enum eration by T, B, NK TruCount and phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_600202]. 
Statis tical Considerations:
Sample Size:
The number of subjects is not based on statistical power considerations. If 4 responders are observed out of 10 
subjects at a dose level, a 90% confidence interval for the response rate is (0.15, 0.70).
Endpoints:
Primary endpoints of safety will be measured by [CONTACT_117795], SAE, ECG, and laboratory abnorm alities including safety 
biomarkers of d -Dimer and TAT. 
Secondary endpoint of efficacy is measured by [CONTACT_30530]. Secondary endpoints of PK include Cmax, CLT, 
AUC(TAU), Ctrough, AI_AUC, and AI_Cmax.
Exploratory endpoints include time to response, duration of response, and time to peak response.
Endpoints for the Long Term Extension Period
Primary endpoints of safety for the long-term extension period will be measured by [CONTACT_117795], SAE, ECG, and laboratory 
abnormalities including safety biomarkers of d -Dimer and TAT.
The endpoint of efficacy is measured by [CONTACT_30530].

≥30,000/mm3and at least [ADDRESS_794867] 
failed conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_600204], splenectom y and TPO 
mimetics. It is anticipated that efficacious doses of BMS -986004 will provide long lasting 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 08-Aug-[ADDRESS_794868] a 
favorable Risk/ Benefit profile.
Detailed information regarding the preclinical toxicology  findings based on nonclinical studies 
inmonkey s with BMS -986004 can be found in Section 1.5.2 and the Investigator Brochure .
1.5.1 Potential risks associated with BMS -986004
BMS -986004 is a dimeric anti- human CD40L  VH dAb formatted with the Fc -tail from abatacept 
(modified IgG1) that is entirely inert in Fc effector function, especiall y in context of FcγRIIa. All 
data from nonclinical and NHP studies demonstrate that BMS -[ADDRESS_794869] biacor e binding analy sis with FcγRIIa. 
Based on previous clinical experience with antibodies targeting costimulatory  molecules and in 
particular with anti-CD40L  antibodies, potential risks include: (1) increased probability  of TE; 
(2) an increase in susceptibili ty to infection and (3) immunogenic potential including infusion 
reactions and formation of ADA. In addition to conventional safet y assessments, general risk 
mitigation plan includes the following:
To initiate dosing at 75 mg dose that has demonstrated favorable safet y profile in health y 
subjects in clinical evaluation. This dose is expected to elicit a sub-optimal response while 
ensuring very  good safety  profile.
To utilize safety  criteria for intra-subject dose escalation and safet y criteria for dose-pane l 
escalation and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].
1.5.[ADDRESS_794870]
To continue to mitigate the potential risk of thromboembolism, the following safety  measures are 
included in ITP study :
Close monitoring of an y potential TE activities after BMS -986004 admini stration. In addition 
to observing clinical manifestations of both venous and arterial TE, the primary  safety 
biomarkers, d-Dimer and Thrombin anti -Thrombin (TAT), will be monitored to evaluate risk 
of thromboembolism. 
TE related exclusion criteria have been added to the protocol; patients with history 
thromboembolic disease (including TIA, stroke, pulmonary  embolism, deep vein thrombosis 
and thrombotic complications) or significant cardiovascular disease (including congestive 
heart failure, arrh ythmias a nd other conditions known to increase risk of TE) are excluded.
1.5.[ADDRESS_794871]
As with any novel immunomodulating agent, there is a possibility  of reducing normal immune 
function as a consequence of targeted CD40L blockade and therefore the following safet y 
measures are included in the ITP study :

Exclusion criteria relative to positive tests for hepatitis B and C, TB and HIV have been 
included in the protocol.
Concurrent or recent use of systemic immune -modulating agents is prohibited or restricted to 
reduce potential risks associated with combinations of immune suppressors.
Patients will be very closely  followed and evaluated for any signs or symptoms of infection 
and complete blood count (CBC) differential counts, lymphocy te immunopheno typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and
measurement of serum Ig -levels (IgG, IgA and IgM) and CRP will be monitored frequently .
1.5.[ADDRESS_794872], infusion reactions are a risk, even following a single dose. To 
reduce the risk of infusion reactions, patients will be closely  monitored by [CONTACT_600224]. In addition, IV 
administration of study drug will not exceed infusion rate of 12.5 mg/min (Table 4-1). 
Furthermore, patients with history  of any significant drug allergy  or serious adverse reaction or 
hypersensitivity  to an y IV administered biologic will be excluded from the study .
1.5.[ADDRESS_794873] and include 
discomfort at the injection site, bleeding, bruising, and rarely  blood clot formation, infection, and 
fainting. Furthermore, rescue medications are permitted in the study  for severe bleeding or wet 
purpura or if the investigator thinks the patient sis at immediate risk. These medications are to 
be given with the intended purpose of raising platelet counts.

3 INVESTIGA TIONA L PLA N
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 1b/2, multicenter, open- label study to evaluate the safet y, efficacy , dose response, 
and pharmacology  (PK, target engagement and PD) of BMS -986004 in subjects with I TP. 
The study  will comprise a short -term period and a long term extension (LTE) period. 
The short -term period, is divided into three phases: Response Phase (6 weeks), Remission Phase 
(6 weeks) and Follow Up phase (8 weeks).
Screening evaluations to determine subject eligibility  will be performed [ADDRESS_794877] dose . To be eligible for enrollment, platelet count needs to be less 
than 30,000/ mm3and show stable or declining trend. If the mean platelet count is between 
30,000 - 35,000/ mm3the subject may be considered for enrol lment on a case by [CONTACT_600225].

count of 10 subjects in each dose panels, except subjects will not be replaced if they are 
discontinued from the study  secondary  to anadverse event unless the adverse event can be 
determined to be unrelated to treatment .
Subjects are treated in dose panels of 10 subjects each. Four (4) dose panels are planned to be 
enrolled sequentiall y in an ascending manner, with dose intensity  selected to provide increased 
levels of immunosuppression at stead y state. Dose levels (range from 75 mg to 1500 mg 
administered every  two weeks) that are planned to be evaluated in this trial are expected to elicit 
a range of clinical response. 
BMS -986004 will be administered once every  2 weeks as an IV infusion for a total of 7 doses.
Four (4) doses will be administered during the Response Phase over a 6week treatment period. 
The remaining 3doses will be administered during the Remi ssion Phase of the study  over a
6week treatment period. Subjects will receive investigational product on Day 1/Week 0, Week 
2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 10 and Week 1 2, for a total of 7 doses. 
Each dose cohort will enroll 10 new subjects, starting with the respective dose level at 
Day1/Week 0, regardless of the number of subjects joining a dose cohort because of intra-subject 
dose escalation. 
A new cohort may be opened to treat subjects at a dose lower than [ADDRESS_794879] 6 subjects 
treated at the 75 mg cohort achieve platelet Response (R) (platelet count ≥ 30,000/mm3and at 
least 2-fold increase from the baseline count and absence of bleeding ), at the end of response 
phase (Week 6). The new cohort would follow the same schedule as the other cohorts including 
intra-subject dose escalation.
The long term extension (LTE) period is optional and will include eligible subjects from either 
cohort 3 or cohort 4 who complete 12 week s(85-days) of treatment and who achieve aresponse
as defined by  [CONTACT_2669] a doubling of platelets from Short Term Day  1 baseline and a platelet count 
of ≥ 35,000/mm3, and absence of bl eeding and any significant AEs as assessed on D71 or if more 
recent platelet count is available , based on the most recent platelet count or on the average of the 
two consecutive most recent platelet counts, whichever is higher .If a subject has platelet counts 
close to a doubling of platelets and/orbetween 30,000-35,000 platelets/ mm3and absence of 
bleeding and any significant AEs as assessed on D71, the subject may  be considered for the long 
term extension on a case by [CONTACT_413], which will involve a review of data from the short term 
period and which will require approval by  [CONTACT_600226].

If any of the above criteria are met within a dose level, the progression to a higher dose level will 
be put on hold and all safety  data available across the study  will be evaluated to estimate the risk 
of proceeding to the higher dose level. The review will include all of the subject(s) that 
experienced SAEs listed above. In addition, data set may include subjects from a dose panel, the 
entire dose panel, or if appropriate, all randomized subjects treated to date. 
In addition, decision may be made followi ng discussions between the Study  Team and the 
Investigator to halt dose escalation for reasons not defined above, including but not limited to, 
observing a single serious adverse event in individual subjects, observing trends in a given dose 
panel and across dose panels, and/or it is determined that the limit of safet y and/or tolerabilit y 
has been reached. 
If dose escalation is stopped due to any of these findings, additional cohorts may receive the 
same or lower doses of the investigational compound.
At the time of dose escalation, dose levels of new cohorts may be adjusted to lower doses if the 
accumulated safet y data so dictates.
Adaptive dose selection may be performed to adjust some pre-selected doses, e.g., the third 
or/and fourth cohort doses, using accumulated efficacy  and dose or exposure data. Models based 
on response rate, such as but not limited to (Bay esian) logistic regression, (Bay esian) EMax, may 
be utilized to predict a dose satisfy ing certain efficacy  criteria, which might be different from the 
standard. If there are enough responding subjects with multiple platelet measurements, changes 
of platelet count may be directly  modeled by [CONTACT_600230].
The selected dose for a cohort should not exceed the original ly planned dose for that cohort, i.e., 
selected dose for cohort C should not be larger than 675mg and it should be at most 1500 mg for 
cohort D.

potential TE event. Prothrombin time (PT) and activated Partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will 
be assessed at screening as measures of a hypercoagulable state. D-dimer and thrombin anti-
thrombin (TAT) in plasma will be quantified as measures of TE risk. Serum troponin I will be 
monitored as an indicator of potentially  TE-related subclinical myocardial infarction. Data from 
these primary  safety biomarker measurements will be collected and carefully  evaluated in the 
context of a thorough review of all available clinical data and used to formulate go/no -go 
decisions prior to dose escalation.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The ca usal relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relati onship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously  reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
NOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasi as or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled asSAE s. (See 
Section 6.1.1 for rep orting pregnancies).
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52205]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative reason ).
Admission for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs 
(applies to oncology  proto cols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safet y 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting.
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within [ADDRESS_794934] be collected 
that 
relate to an y later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ).

The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure.
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not relate d to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_794935] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting colle ction is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy  surveillance forms are only  
intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission t o:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
SAE Facsimile Number :Refer to Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper form s should be used and submitted immediately , only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, 
the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy  reporting) : Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drugor if new inform ation 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using th e same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non serious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformation should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic).

discussion of benefits and risk with the subject.
Protocol -required procedures for study  discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663]  (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated.

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely  confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1. AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)
AND 
2.Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_794941], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND 
3.No other immediatel y apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
The key responsibilities for investigators during p-DILI assessment include: (i) Early  detection, 
medical evaluation (including the exclusion of other potential causes) and rapid laboratory  
confirmation of liver-related abnormalities, and (ii) Sponsor notification of p- DILI cases via 
SAE forms. Following the gathering and assessment of relevant clinical information the sponsor 
is responsible for: (iii) Timely  evaluation and triaging of p-DILI cases, (iv) Expedited reporting 
of p-DILI cases and (v) Expanded review of p-DILI cases including a detailed assessment of all 
available clinical information, investigations and biochemical data.
Investigators are expected to monitor ongoing routine and ad hoc hepatic laboratory  test results 
to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_600208] a subject meets p-DILI criteria. They  are expected to promptl y 
notify  BMS of all p-DILI cases. p-DILI cases may be identified by [CONTACT_499842], whether or not they are accompanied by [CONTACT_79939]-related signs and/or symptoms. In both 
cases, expedited confirmation with repeat laboratory  testing should occur within 3 business days 
using a Hepatic Laboratory  Panel (ALT, AST, TB, AP). Any subject with an abnormal Hepatic 
Laboratory  Panel that meets p-DILI criteria is a candidate for study  drug discontinua tion. Any 
confirmed p-DILI events must be reported (along with a description of the clinical findings) to 
BMS as an SAE within 24hrs of confirmation. 
An extensive clinical history , examination and appropriate investigations should be obtained to 
exclude c holestatic and other apparent causes that may explain the observed abnormalities in 
liver function and/or hepatic signs and symptoms. Other apparent causes include, 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 08-Aug-[ADDRESS_794942] of example only: infectious diseases (such as active hepatitis -A, 
-B and -C), congenital diseases (such as Gilbert’s syndrome), neoplastic diseases (such as 
hepatocellular carcinoma), automimmune diseases (such as primary  biliary  cirrhosis) and the use 
of concomitant hepatotoxic medications (such as antibiotics, the oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_120013]). All investigations to exclude potential causes of liver function abnormalities 
or hepatic signs and/or symptoms should be guided by [CONTACT_600244]’s age, 
gender, clinical history , and signs and symptoms. If necessary , after discussion with Sponsor’s 
safet y team, Investigator may perform additional diagnostic tests/procedures to further diagnose 
pDILI (e.g. ultrasound, MRI /MRS, liver biopsy ).
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required 
by [CONTACT_20492] a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported 
accordingl y. 
7 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE A ND OTHER EXTE RNA L 
COMMITTEES
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will perform safet y and efficacy  assessments at regularl y 
scheduled times as well as on an ad hoc basis if needed. The DMC will review relevant safet y 
data from preceding Cohorts before the study  progresses to the next Cohort. In addition, formal 
DMC monitoring meetings will occur when a maximum of [ADDRESS_794943] is randomized to the 
study  (whichever comes first).
Thereafter, DMC monitoring will be performed at approximately  [ADDRESS_794944] 11 weeks of exposure (whichever comes first) until all 
subjects are enrolled into the study . At that time, the DMC will meet every [ADDRESS_794945] of the study .

Expanded definition Complete abstinence as defined as 
complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse is an 
acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs. This 
also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifesty le 
of the patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (e.g., 
calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, profession of abstinence 
for entry  into a clinical trial, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Subjects who choose complete abstinence are 
not required to use a second method of contraception, but 
female subjects must continue to have pregnancy  tests. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highl y effective 
contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject 
chooses to forego complete abstinence.

AE evaluation period at the current cohort and at the same time keepi[INVESTIGATOR_600211].
Please note that AE would be closely  monitored throughout the trial for each subject, and the 2 
weeks’ AE evaluation period mentioned here is for the purpose of cohort escalation only . During 
the evaluation period, the numbers of subjects who developed drug-related SAE within the same 
organ system at grade [ADDRESS_794961] number will 
be used.
Decision R isk
The decision risk is mathematically  defined as the probability  of observing enough number of 
event(s) in the still non -evaluable subjects given data collected from evaluable subjects such that 
cohort escalation is not allowed. Evaluable subjects are th ose who are observed an AE of interest 
or complete the AE evaluation period. To enroll subject into the next cohort, the non-adaptive 
cohort escalation rule requires, among others, no more than one subject being reported drug-
related serious adverse event or serious infection and infestation within the evaluation period. 
Therefore, if one subject is observed with an AE of interest, the decision risk would be the 
probability  of observing at least one more AE of interest in the non-evaluable subjects; if no AE 
of interest is reported, the decision risk is thus the probability  of observing at least two AEs of 
interest from the non -evaluable subjects.
Decision Data
To take advantage of the titration design, in which subjects could possibly  take a higher dose that 
is to be used initially  in the next cohort, the adaptive decision rule makes use of the following 
three statistics: 
Titration -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nH): the number of subjects who are titrated and 
complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) starting fro m the titration’s first dose (on day  43).
Start -Dose Evaluable Subjects (nL): the number of subjects who develop drug related SAE at 
grade 3 or higher or complete the evaluation period (2 weeks) from the first dose (on day 1) 
but haven’t completed the [ADDRESS_794962] titration dose (on day  
43) if being titrated to a higher dose .
Count of AE of Interest (k): number of subjects with AE of interests, which could happen 
any time after the first dose of BMS- 986004 till the decision making day. Apparentl y, k=0 or 
1. Please note that it doesn’t distinguish at which stage, prior to or post titration, that such AE 
happened.
With sample size of 10 for each cohort, the number if non -evaluable subjects is 10 -nH- nL.

information is solicited from a phase III study  of Abatacept IM101174, in which 12 out 721 
subjects (1.7%) were reported to experience drug related SAEs within short term period (half 
year treatment). The prior used is Beta(0.01, 0.49) , which indicates 2% rate and is equivalent of 
contributing 0.[ADDRESS_794964] at each dose.
Decision risk for k=1 is listed below (values are provided only for when the number evaluable 
subjects, nH+nL, is at least 5, and at most 9). Bayesian MCMC simulation is performed to 
compute the posterior predictive probabilit y under R version 3.1.0 with a random seed of 
20140625.

Date: 08-Aug-[ADDRESS_794967] an adaptive dose fora given response rate. 
Simulations of both logistic regression and Bayesian logistic regression are provided to show 
their performance in predicting dose for pre-selected response rate. New method of analyzing 
data obtained from the study  with titration design is also included. More detailed discussion will 
be available in the stu dy’s statistical analy sis plan (SAP).  
Adaptive dose selection is not limited to the Baye sian logistic regression model described in this 
appendix. Alternative modeling includes, for example, nonlinear or linear mixed effect 
regression of longitudinal platelet count. Specifically , when PK exposure data are available, 
model based on PK exposure may  be a better choice than that on dose only since there are only  a 
few distinct values of doses. 
Adaptive dose selection can be performed as early  as when the third cohort is about to enroll 
subjects. However, it is advised that the predicted dose would be more reliable when more data 
are available, e.g., when the fourth cohort is about to enroll. For safety  reasons, the selected dose 
to be administered at a higher cohort cannot be larger than what is planned for that cohort.
Bayesian Logistic Model Description
The model is described below:
where , at each dose level i, diis dose in mg, pi[INVESTIGATOR_600212], niis the number of 
subjects treated atdose di, and yiis the number of responders. Model parameters βare assumed a 
normal distribution with mean μ and variance ψ. Explaining variable, dose, is in log scale, and is 
subtrac ted by [CONTACT_600248](75), where 75 is the minimum dose administered at cohort 1. By 
[CONTACT_600249], intercept parameter μ alone can be interpreted as the log odd 
value of the expected response rate for cohort 1, and as such it is easy to set prior distribution 
parameters (shown below).
Prior of the model parameters is set under the following guidelines:
Model -predicted response rate at each dose level matches the expected rate.
A 97.5% quantile of the response rate at the lowest dose is around 0.4.
A 2.5% quantile of the response rate at the highest dose is around 0.35.
Extremely  small probability  for β2being negative 

It is assumed that the response rate at dose of 75mg, 225mg, 675mg, and 1500mg to be 0.2, 0.4, 
0.55 and 0.7 respectivel y. A linear regression using the above data will give prior mean μ to be ( 
-1.33, 0.72) with rounding error. The second and third bullets of the guidelines would make the 
stand deviation of β1to be 0.45, and β2to be 0.2. Prior distributions of β1and β2are assumed to 
be independent. A 95% credible interval of response rates under prior and without observation 
data is shown in Figure 1, where the top curve is the upper 97.5% quantile, the center is the 
mean, and the bottom is the lower 2.5% quantile. The circles represent the expected response 
rates at the selected doses. I t can be seen that the chosen prior would lead to a mean response rate 
estimate being very close to the expected or assumed, and at the same time the wide region of 
95% credible interval indicates that the prior’s weak impact on the posterior estimation of 
response rate when data are observed.

Special consideration for titration
Non-responders at each cohort other than themaximum 1500mg cohort would be administered 
higher dose with the hope of becoming responders. Therefore, two response status data may be 
observed for those non-responders. Due to relative small sample size of each cohort, making use 
of status data after the titration dose is believed to increase the accuracy  of model- based 
prediction under some reasonable assumptions. Listed in the below are two assumptions used in 
the adaptive dose selection:
If a subject responses to a dose, the subject would respond to higher dose with probability  1.200 400 [PHONE_12444] 1200 [ZIP_CODE].0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

If a subject does not respond to a dose after [ADDRESS_794968] change from non -responder to responder.
Based on the above assumptions, a new approach is proposed to combine the subjects at two 
adjacent cohorts to estimate the response rate at the higher dose which is shared by [CONTACT_600250].
Simulation
Trial simulation is done to show the performance of logistic regression and Bayesian logistic 
regression with starting dose data only or with titration data included. The Settings of simulation 
parameters are listed below for convenience:
Doses: 75, 225, 675, 1500
Rate: 0.2, 0.4, 0.55, 0.7
Conditional response rate for non -responder after titration:0.25, 0.25, 0.33
Response rate used to predict dose: 0.7 (equivalently  the fourth cohort)
Number of simulated trials: 1000
Prediction results from four different methods are compared with each other.
SLogit: L ogistic regression with response status from starting dose only
SBayLogit: Bay esian logistic regression with response status from starting dose only
DLogit: Logistic regression with response status from both starting dose and titration dose
DBayLogit: Bayesian logistic regression with response status from both starting dose and 
titration dose
Simulation results are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that Bayesian modeling provides less 
variant and seemingl y closer -to-true-value predictions compared to the usual logistic regression. 
In addition, variation of the predicted dose is smaller by [CONTACT_600251].

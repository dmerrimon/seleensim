Amendment 4 [9 May  2021 ] 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment change:  The protocol is being amended to 
document the increase in blood volumes drawn at certain visits (Visit 2 and Visit 6)  to 
improve the serum yield which is critical to evaluate the study endpoints. The  allowed  
window s for study visits during special circumstances have also been widened to 
maintain subject visit compliance during the  COVID -[ADDRESS_615854] (pre -filled syringes), the amended protocol provides 
instru ctions for collection of safety information related to the use of medical devices.  The 
reporting period for pregnancies has also been updated in line with the current guidelines.   
The list of main changes in the protocol with rationale is presented in Table 2 and all 
changes made to this amendment ( including correction of typos) are presented in the 
amendment history  (Refer to Section 12.10.1 ).

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  19 1. SYNOPSIS  
Rationale:  
In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed with the Company  
proposa l to evaluate  meningococcal B vaccine  effec tiveness against a large panel of US 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_479610] N. meningitidi s serogrou p B in 
adolescent s using serum bacter icidal  assay s with endogenou s huma n complement (en c-
hSBA). This panel includes 110 serogroup B strains randomly selected from the original 
panel of 442 endemi c strains identified as appropriately representative of invasive 
meningococcal serogroup B strains detected in the US by  [CONTACT_27388] (CDC ) [Welsch , 2018] .  
Following licensure of Bexsero  (rMenB+OMV NZ) in the US in [ADDRESS_615873] -approval confirmatory trial  in US adolescents and adults . To date, 
there has not been an evaluation c ompleted to assess the  vaccine  effec tivenes s of the 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine against the panel (as described above) of the US 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_479611] N. meningitidis serogroup B.  
The investigational MenABCWY combination vaccine is based upon two established 
[COMPANY_004] vaccines, the quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine ( Menveo ) and 
the multi -component recombinant meningococcal B vaccine ( Bexsero ), for which 
significant nonclinical and clinical data have been generated and used to support 
marketing author isations in US, European Union (EU) and several other countries. The 
MenABCWY investigational vaccine  will be reconstituted from the following two 
components before administration:  
• the MenACWY component lyophil ised in vial;  
• the MenB liquid component in prefilled syringe.  
The MenACWY component contains the same antigens in the same amounts as the 
commercial Menveo , in a lyophil ised form. The MenB liquid component is the same 
formulation as the commercial Bexsero . 
The primary purpose of this study is hence  to demonstrate the  vaccine effectiveness using 
enc-hSBA against a panel of 110 randomly selected endemic US N. meningitidis  
serogroup B invasive disease strains, when administered in a 3 -dose (0,2,6 -months) or a 
2-dose (0,6 -months; 0,2 -months) schedule as a meningococcal gr oup B vaccine ( Bexsero ) 
and when administered in a 2 -dose (0,6 -months) schedule as a combined MenABCWY 
vaccine.  
In addition, the other main objectives of this study are:  
• to demonstrate the consistency of immune responses from 3 production lots of the 
MenAC WY component of the MenABCWY vaccine,  
• to demonstrate the non -inferiority of a 2 -dose series of MenABCWY vaccine versus 
a single dose of Menveo  (MenACWY) in terms of immune response to 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y,  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  20 • to demonstrate the non -inferior ity of the effectiveness of the MenABCWY vaccine 
versus Bexsero  (rMenB+OMV NZ ) against a randomly selected panel of endemic 
US N. meningitidis serogroup B invasive disease strains,  
• to assess the safety of all study vaccines administered as per their vaccin ation 
schedule to healthy subjects aged 10 -25 years.

[COMPANY_004]  investigational MenABCWY vaccine intended to protect against [ADDRESS_615915] 
prevalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans. This combination  
vaccine is based upon two established [COMPANY_004] vaccines, the quadrivalent meningococcal 
ACWY conjugate vaccine ( Menveo ) and the multi -component recombinant 
meningococcal B vaccine ( Bexsero ), for which significant non clinical and clinical data 
have been generated and used to support marketing author isations in US, European 
Union (EU) and several other countries. The MenABCWY investigational vaccine will 
be reconstituted from the following two components before administ ration:  
• the MenACWY component lyophil ised in vial;  
• the MenB liquid component in prefilled syringe.  
The MenACWY component contains the same antigens in the same amounts as the 
commercial Menveo , in a lyophil ised form. The MenB liquid component is the same 
formulation as the commercial Bexsero . 
The primary purpose of this study is to hence  demonstrate the vaccine effectiveness using 
enc-hSBA against a randomly selected panel of endemic US N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
invasive disease strains, when administered  in a 3 -dose (0,2,6 -months) or a 2 -dose (0,6 -
months; 0,2 -months) schedule as a meningococcal group B vaccine ( Bexsero ) and when 
administered in a 2 -dose (0,6 -months) schedule as a combined MenABCWY vaccine.  
In addition, the other main objectives of this st udy are:  
• to demonstrate the consistency of immune responses from 3 production lots of the 
MenACWY component of the MenABCWY vaccine,  
• to demonstrate the non -inferiority of a 2 -dose series of MenABCWY vaccine versus 
a single dose of Menveo  (MenACWY) in term s of immune response to 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y,  
• to demonstrate the non -inferiority of the effectiveness of the MenABCWY vaccine 
versus Bexsero  (rMenB+OMV ) against a randomly selected panel of endemic US N. 
meningitidis  serogroup B invasive disease strains,  
• to assess the safety of all study vaccines administered as per their vaccination 
schedule to healthy subjects aged 10 -25 years.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  36 3.2. Background  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
N. meningitidis  is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide, capable 
of causing outbreaks and epi[INVESTIGATOR_479613]. N. meningitidi s infec tions 
causing invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are an important public health concern 
worldwide due t o the substantial morbidi ty and mortality they cause , as well as the 
transmissibili ty of these infec tions. In healthy individuals, IMD can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_479614], including  fatali ty in 
~10% of cases. While the greatest IMD burden is in infants, there is a second peak of 
disease in adolescents and young adults. 
IMD  occurs when the normally asymptomatically carried encapsulated  gram-negative 
bacterium N. meningitidi s enters  the bloodstream,  multiplies and causes sepsis. Once the 
blood -brain  barrier  is compromised, development of acute bacterial meningi tis represents 
a neurological emergency and necessitates immediate diagnosis and treat ment 
[Heckenberg , 2014 ]. Although IMD occurs worldwide, incidence varies in different 
geographic regions, with the highest disease burden observed in lo w-income countries . 
Reliable estimates of the global bu rden of disease are currently not available, as case 
defini tions differ and surveillance data from many regions are inc omplete [Gossger , 
2012 ]. The overall incidence of IMD in European countries ranges fr om approximately  
0.1 to 2.4  cases per 100  000 popula tions [ECDC , 2016 ]. In the US, incidence was 0.1 
cases per 100  000 population [ CDC , 2018].  
Ninety percent  of menin gococcal mening itis and  septicaemia  are caused by [CONTACT_479666] N. 
meningitidis  serogroups : A, B, C, W and Y.  The distribu tion of serogroup s varies 
geographically  and over time. While the disease  burden  of IMD  in highe r-income 
regions, such as Europe and Australia,  is largely attributable to serogroup  B, in the 
‘meningi tis belt’ of su b-Saharan Africa, IMD is predominan tly caused by [CONTACT_167508] A 
and W. In the US, serogroups B, C and Y account for most IMD .  
The best option for the control of meningococcal disease is the use of effective vaccines 
that would include all five of the most common serogroups responsible for invasive 
disease.  
[COMPANY_004]’s  Meningococcal Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Conjugate Vaccine ( Menveo ) is a 
meningococcal oligosaccharide conjugate vaccine licensed for active immun isation to 
prevent IMD caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, C, W -135, and Y . It contains a 
nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin ( Corynebacterium diphtheriae  Cross Reacting 
Materia l-197, CR M197) as the carrier protein  and has been demonstrated to be  highly  
immunogenic against serogroups ACWY and is well tolerated in all age groups. It has 
been licensed in more than 60 countries ; many of these countries have also approved its 
use in children. In the EU, the vaccine is indicated for use in individuals 2 years of age 
and older, and in the US, in individuals 2 months to 55 years of age.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

meningitidis  serogroup B. Although the meningococcal group B vaccine was developed 
for individuals aged 2 mont hs and older, the actual age range for which this 
recommendation extends varies depending on the approval from different health 
authorities.  
With evidence of meningococcal epi[INVESTIGATOR_479615] [ Cohn , 2015; Halperin , 2012 ; Harrison , 2009 ], a vaccine with the broadest 
possible coverage is an important step toward a definitive and global solution for 
meningococcal disease prevention.  
[COMPANY_004] is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a combinatio n vaccine intended to protect against five of the 
most prevalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans. The availability 
of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would reduce the 
number of injections and could inc rease coverage for meningococcal disease caused by 
N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y worldwide.

Facial paresis  Facial paresis was recogn ised as an importa nt potential 
risk following the results of a sponsored observational 
study (V59_34OB) which found an imbalance of cases of 
facial paresis following vaccination with MenACWY,

5. STUDY D ESIGN  
5.1. Scientific rationale for study design  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
As the rMenB+OMV NZ licensure  in the US was issued through accelerated approval, 
the FDA has requested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vaccine against an 
extended panel of serogroup B meningococcal strains (MenB)  as a post -marketing 
commitment  in US adolescents and young adults , thus confirming that the vaccine can 
protect against diverse meningococcal B strains prevalent in the US. 
The availability of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would 
however reduce the numbe r of injections and could increase coverage for meningococcal 
disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y worldwide. [COMPANY_004]’s 
investigational MenABCWY  combination vaccine is intended to protect against [ADDRESS_615941] prevalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans.  
Hence, along with the licensed MenB vaccine ( Bexsero ), this Phase III study will also 
assess the safety, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of the investigational MenABCWY 
vaccine.  
Rationale for effectiveness  assessment  
As mentioned above, o ne of the primary purposes of this study is to evaluate the 
effectiveness of 2 or 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ and of [ADDRESS_615942] 110 endemic US N. meningitidis  serogroup B strains using an endogenous 
complement human Serum Bactericidal Assay (enc -hSBA), when compared to a control.  
Sera from the ACWY group receiving the MenACWY vaccine will also be tested against 
serogroup B meningococcal strains by [CONTACT_479657] -hSBA as a control  for test -based effectiveness  
assessment . The overall vaccine effectiveness ( VE) against all 110 strains combined will 
be computed by [CONTACT_3553] a general ised linear model. For additional details see statistica l 
analysis section (Section 10). 
Rationale for lot-to-lot consistency  assessment  
MenABCWY is a reconstituted vaccine with the lyophilised ‘ACWY component’ and 
liquid  rMenB+OMV NZ. The MenB component has the same formulation as the 
commercial Bexsero . To demonstrate that the lots of the investigational MenABCWY 
vaccine are adequately representative of the formulation intended for marketing, 
equival ence will be assessed for 3 different lots of the ACWY component of the 
ABCWY vaccine.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

205416 [MENB REC  2ND GEN -038 (V72_72)]  
Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  48 Rationale for non-inferiority assessment of MenABCWY vs MenACWY and 
rMenB+OMV NZ  
The study aims to also demonstrate that the  investigational combination MenABCWY 
vaccine  is not inferior to a licensed MenACWY vaccine (Menveo ) and a licensed MenB 
vaccine (Bexsero ) which are part of  the current standards of care in the US for prevention 
of invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, C, W, Y  and by 
N. meningitidis  serogroup B , respectively . 
Rationale for blood volume collected:  
In order to provide the necessary serum volume  for the bactericidal assays (enc -hSBA 
and/ or hSBA(s))  and ELISA (or equivalent ), approximately  30 mL whole blood will be 
collected at Visit 2 and Visit 6 and approximately 25 mL whole blood will be collected 
at Visit 4 . At pre-vaccination (Visit 1), 20 mL whole blood will be collected to provide 
the necessary serum volume for th e hSBA , and ELISA (or equivalent ).  
Blood samples are taken from all subjects irrespective of the testing status in order to 
maintain the study blind. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for furthe r details.  
Rationale for the selected vaccination schedules  
rMenB+OMV NZ: Th is study aims to demonstra te the VE of the rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccine administered as 2 -dose vaccine, either with a shorter interval (0,2 -months) or a 
prolonged interval (0,6 -months) between doses. A 3-dose schedule has also been  added to 
better characterize the VE  with an alternative dose  regimen as a post approval 
requirement from the US FDA . 
Note: The rMenB+OMV NZ  in the ACWY group is administered in a 0,[ADDRESS_615943] 
characteristics of Bexsero  and helps in mainta ining the blind. No objectives are 
associated with this schedule of rMenB+OMV NZ . 
MenABCWY: A number of different vaccine formulations were evaluated in 
MenABCWY Phase I and II clinical studies. The formulation with the same active 
ingredient composition a s the rMenB+OMV NZ ( Bexsero ) and MenACWY ( Menveo ) 
vaccines was chosen as the final formulation of the investigational MenABCWY vaccine.  
Two doses administered 6 months apart (0,6 -months) is considered the optimal dosing

For this study, a placebo (saline solution) will be administered as presented in  Figure 1. A 
placebo is the only available option to minimize possible introduction of reporting bias in

• Experimental design: This is a  phase III, randomised, controlled, observe r-blind , 
multi-centre  study  to evaluate effec tivenes s, immunogenicity  and safet y of 
rMenB+OMV NZ  and MenABCWY vaccine s. A total of 3651  healthy adolescent s 
and young adults aged 10-25 years will be enrolled  and randomised (5:5:3:3:3:1  
ratio) to one of the six parallel study  group s:  
− MenB_0_2_6 group : subjects will receive 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ  at Day 
1, Day 61 and Day 181 ( 0,2,6-months  schedule).  These subjects will receive 1 
dose of the MenACWY vaccine at Day 211 *. Data from this group will be used 
to assess both the 0,2 -months and 0,2,6 -months schedules; the 0,2 -months 
schedule will be assessed 1 month after the second rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccination administered at Day 61 (Visit 3), and the 0,2,[ADDRESS_615944] rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination at Day 181 
(Visit 5), in the same group . 
− MenB_0_6 group : subjects will receive 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ  at Day 1  
and Day 181 and 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 61 ( rMenB+OMV NZ , 
0,6-months schedule).  These subjects will receive 1 dose of placebo at Day 
211*. 
− ABCWY -1**: subjects will receive 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months 
apart (0,6 -months schedule ), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 1 of the MenACWY 
lyophilised vial component of the vaccine. They will receive 1 dose of placebo 
at Day 61 and at Day 211 *.  
− ABCWY -2**: subjects will receive 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months 
apart (0,6 -months schedule ), at Day 1 and 181 wit h Lot 2 of the MenACWY 
lyophilised vial component of the vaccine. They will receive 1 dose of placebo 
at Day 61 and at Day 211 *. 
− ABCWY -3**: subjects will receive 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months 
apart (0,6 -months schedule ), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 3 of the MenACWY 
lyophilised vial component of the vaccine. They will receive 1 dose of placebo 
at Day 61 and at Day 211 *. 
− ACWY  group : subjects will receive 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 1, 1 
dose of placebo at Day 61 and 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ  at Day 18 1 and Day 
211*. 
* In order to let the subjects in MenB_0_2_6 group receive a dose of MenACWY 
vaccine and for subjects in ACWY group to receive the second dose of rMenB+OMV 
NZ in line with the vaccine as standard of care  (also in line with the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations in the US [ ACIP , 
2011]) , the subjects in these groups will receive a  vaccination of MenACWY and 
rMenB+OMV NZ  vaccines, respectively, on Day 211 (Visit 6) after completion of the 
post-vaccination [ADDRESS_615945] of the groups (MenB_0_6, ABCWY -1, ABCWY -2 and ABCWY -3) will 
receive a dose of Placebo. All these vaccines/ product s administered at Day 211 are 
not associated with any study objectives/ endpoints ( safety assessment conducted 
after 1 dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in the ACWY group at Day 181 is to maintain the 
blind  of the study).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in  the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study centre . The Subject ID will be documented in the 
Screening and Enrolment log.  
The eligibility of the subject will be determined based on the inclusion and exclusio n

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_615968] to a study group/a treatment number at the investigator site will 
be performed using a random isation system on internet (SBIR). The random isation 
algorithm will use a minim isation procedure accounting for study, region  (US and ex-US 
countries) , previous MenACWY vaccination  (primed) ? (Yes and No )*, and age category 
(10-17 years of age and 18 -25 years of age) . Minim isation factors will have equal  weight 
in the minimisation algorithm . 
To ensure adequate representation in the US in line with the post -marketing commitment  
(Section 3.1), a minimum of 30% of adolescents and young adults will be enrolled in the 
US. 
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF/IAF from the subject/subject’s parent/LAR and 
having checked the eligibi lity of the subject, blinded site staff will access SBIR. Upon 
providing the subject identification number, the subject ’s age category and previous 
MenACWY vaccination ? (Yes/ No)*, the random isation system will determine the study 
group and will provide the treatment number to be used  for each dose.  The number of 
each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
When SBIR is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions . 
If for any reason, after random isation the subject fails to undergo treatment, this is an 
early Termina tion and the reason should be recorded in source document as specified in 
the SDA.  
Note that enrolment will be frozen as soon as the target number s (Table 7) are reached. 
Refer to the SPM for further details.  
Note: * Subjects with and without a previous MenACWY vaccination (primed and 
unprimed) . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses  
For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the study staff in charge of the vaccine/product 
administration will access SBIR, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.  
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.

The evaluation of the randomly selected panel of invasive serogroup B strains (110 
strains) for each vaccinated subject is not technically feasible with clinically acceptable 
blood volumes drawn  from adolescent s and young adults. For each applicable serum 
sample , 35 strains will be chosen completely at random  from the 110 strains.  
• The target  number of strains to be tested for each subject will be 35 strains.  
• The serum sample  collected from each subject will be sent on an ongoing basis to 
[COMPANY_004] Clinical Laboratory Sciences or to laboratories  delegated by [CONTACT_479677] . Aliquots for immunogenicity 
and enc-hSBA testing will be prepared depending on the serum volume available for 
a visit from one subject. A minimum amount of 5 mL of serum needs to be available 
to confirm eligibility to perform enc-hSBA testing.  Additional instruction on  the 
number of strains to be randomly assigned for enc -hSBA testing, according to the 
actual sample volume of serum provided to the laboratory , is provided in Section 
10.1.2 . 
7.3. Blinding  and unblinding  
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By [CONTACT_43049] -blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study, the vaccine(s)/product(s) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_479617] (e.g. safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness ) 
will all be unaware of which vaccine/product was administered. To do so, 
vaccine/product preparation and administration will be done by  [CONTACT_479678].  A minimu m 
number of study site personnel  respon sible for preparing and / or delivering the injec tions 
will be unblinded. See Glossary of terms  for definition of qualified healthcare 
professional  and unblinded study staff.  Site personnel responsible for delivering the 
injection must not be involved in study assessments. The study v accine/placebo will be 
provided to the site as subjects’ kits, similar in appearance, identified with treatment 
information (either Meningococcal Group B Vaccine or Meningococcal Groups A, B , C, 
W and Y Vaccine or Meningococcal Groups A, C, Y and W  Conjuga te Vaccine or 
placebo).  Refer to SPM for details . 
The laboratory in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment , and 
codes will be used to link the subject  and study (without any link to the treatment  
attributed to the subject ) to each sample.   
The serological data, which could lead to the unblinding of the study groups, will not be 
available during the course of the study to any investigator or any person involved in the 
clinical conduct of the study  or analysis . 
7.3.1.  Emergency unblindi ng 
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_615969].  
The emergency unblinding process consists of the  automated Internet -based system 
(SBIR) that allows the investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to 
the subject’s individual study treatment.  
As back -up process, the investigator has the option of contact[CONTACT_30697] a [COMPANY_004] Helpdesk (refer 
to Table 10) if he/she needs support to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access 
the automated Internet -based system).  
Non-investigator physician (e.g. physician from emergency room) or subject/care 
giver/family member can also request emergency unblinding either via the investigator 
(preferred option) or via the [COMPANY_004] Helpdesk (back -up process). Contact [CONTACT_479679]/subject card.

7.4.1.  Storage and handling of study vaccine(s)/product(s)   
The study vaccine(s)/product(s) must be stored at the respective label storage temperature 
conditions in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to 
authori sed study personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre -study 
activities under the responsibility of the sponsor study contac t. The storage temperature 
should be continuously monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

SPM for more details on storage of the study vaccine(s)/prod uct(s).  
A temperature excursion is any temperature that is not in range of the label storage 
temperature conditions. Temperatures outside the range of label storage temperature 
conditions must be reported and/or documented. Temperature excursion impacting study 
vaccine(s)/product(s) must be reported and/or documented.  
In the frame of the reporting, the lack/absence of temperature monitoring documentation 
from a device meeting [COMPANY_004] requirements has to be considered as a temperature 
excursion.  
Study vaccine(s) /product(s) that are impacted by a temperature excursion may not be 
used and must be quarantined at label storage conditions until usage approval has been 
obtained from/via the local study contact (e.g. Site Monitor).  
Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for details and instructions on 
the temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and 
accountability of the study vaccine(s)/product(s).  
7.4.2.  Replacement of unusable vaccine (s)/product (s) doses  
In addition to the vacc ine/product doses provided for the planned number of subjects 
(including over -random isation when applicable), at least 10% additional vaccine/product 
doses will be supplied to replace those that are unusable.  
7.5. Concomitant medication(s)/product(s) and concom itant 
vaccinations  
7.5.1.  Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccinations  
Concomitant medications include all medications taken by/administered to the subject at 
and after enrolment to treat any AE collected in the eCRF and any vaccine administered 
to subjects. These medication s/ vaccine s must be documented on the Prior and 
Concomitant Medications and Vaccination  eCRF.   
At each study visit/contact, the investigator or delegate should question the subject and/or 
the subject’s parent(s)/LA R(s) about any medications/products taken and vaccinations 
received by [CONTACT_423].  When  recording  conc omitant medica tions/vaccines, they  shou ld 
be checked against the study entry and continuation criteria in  Section 6, Selec tion of 
Study Popu lation to ensure that the subject should be enrolled/continue in the stud y. 
The following concomitant medication(s)/product(s)/vaccine(s) must be recorded in the

• Any co ncomitant medications/products/vaccines leading to the withdrawal or non -
eligibility of the subject from the study  (Refer to section 7.5.2  for furth er details) . 
• Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines relevant to a n SAE/ Adverse Event 
of Special interest ( AESI ) to be reported as per protocol or administered at any time 
during the study period for the treatment of a n SAE/ AESI’s . In addition, concomitant 
medications relevant to SAEs and AESI’s  need to be recorded on the expedited 
Adverse Event report.  
• The use of antipyretic and/or other medications to prevent (prophylactic use) and/or 
treat fever during the first 7 days after vac cination to be recorded in the eCRF as 
well.  
Medications taken for prophylaxis are those intended to prevent the onset of 
symptoms. Medications taken for treatment are intended to reduce or eliminate the 
presence of symptoms that are present. An anti -pyret ic is considered to be 
prophylactic when it is given in the absence of fever and any other symptom, to 
prevent fever from occurring [fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F 
regardless the location of measurement]. The preferred location for measuri ng 
temperature in this study will be the oral route.

8.3.1.  Screening / Eligibility criteria  
After an individual or individual’s parent/LAR  has consented participation  in the study  
and infor med consent/assent is signed, that individual will be given a unique Screening 
Number manually created by [CONTACT_8647]. The  subject’s unique Screening Number 
will be d ocumented  in the Screening and Enrolment log. The eligibili ty of the subject 
will be determined based on the inclusi on and exclusi on criteria listed in  Section 6 and 
evaluated during this sc reening  procedure.  
In the event that the i ndividual  is determined  ineligible  for study  participation, he/sh e is 
considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure must be documented in the 
Screening and Enrolment log. If the individual is determined to be eligible for the stud y, 
he/she will  be enrolled into the stud y. 
8.3.2.  Collection of demographic data  
Prior to study enrolment, demographic data will be collected  from the subject, including  
date of birth ( month and year ), gender, race, ethnicity, weight, and heigh t, and recorded 
in the subject’s  eCRF.  
8.3.3.  Medical history  
Medical history  will also be collected, including but not limited to any  medica l history 
that may be relevan t to subject eligibili ty for study participation such as prior 
vaccinations, concomitant medica tions, and previous and ong oing illnesses or injuries. 
Relevant medical history  can also include any  medica l histor y that contributes to the 
understanding of an adverse event that occurs during study  participation, if it represents 
an exacerba tion of an underlying disease/pr e-existing problem.  
Obtain the subject’s medical history by [CONTACT_10393]/or review of the subject’s medical 
records and record any pre -existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a 
subject prior to the first study vaccination  in the eCRF . 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  72 8.3.4.  General and symptom -directed physical examination  
A general physical examination is to be performed by a qualified healthcare practitioner. 
“Qualified health care practitioner” refers to any licensed  or certified healthcare 
professi onal who is permitted by [CONTACT_479684] , and who  is identified within the Delegation of Responsibility Log . The 
physical examination will include examination of organ systems that are relevant to the 
investigator based on medical history and review of systems and a measurement of heart 
rate, blood pressure, and temperature.  
These data will be written in the source  document. Should the physical assessment reveal 
any abnormal values or events, these must be documented in the eCRF Adverse Events 
Form.  
Physical examination at each study visit subsequent to the first vaccination visit, will be 
performed only if the subj ect/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) indicates during questioning that 
there might be some underlying pathology(ies) or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_479685].  
If the investigator determines that the subject’s health on the day of vaccination 
tempor arily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled.  Treatment of any 
abnormality observed during this examination should  be performed according to local 
medical practice outside this study or by [CONTACT_479686].  
8.3.5.  Preg nancy test  
Female subjects of childbearing potential are to have a urine pregnancy test prior to any 
study vaccine administration. The study vaccine(s)/product(s) may only be administered 
if the pregnancy test is negative.  
Urine samples will be collected for pregnancy testing in females of child -bearing 
potential, before vaccinations at Visits 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the results recorded in the source 
document and the eCRF.  
Note: Pregnancy test must be performed even if the subject is menstruating at the time o f 
the study visit.  
8.3.6.  Pre-vaccination body temperature  
The body temperature (preferably oral) of each subject needs to be measured prior to any 
study vaccines administration . If the subject has fever [fever is defined as body 
temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F regar dless of the location of measurement] on the day of 
vaccination, the vaccination visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this 
visit (see Section  6.3). 
Note: If the body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_310247] ( other than oral ), this also 
needs to be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  73 8.4. Effectiveness  and/or immunogenicity  assessments  
Please refer to the SPM and/or Central Laboratory Manual for details on biospecimen 
management (handling, storage and shipment).  
Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).  
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related to 
the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory tests described in 
this protocol. This may include the management o f the quality of these tests, the 
maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods, as well 
as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably.  
Future findings may make it desirable to use the s amples acquired in this study for further 
research, not described in this protocol. Additional serologic al testing may be performed 
in the future to further character ise the antibody response to the antigens included in the 
study vaccines or hSBA against an additional panel of strains of Neisseria  species.  
Therefore, all subjects  in countries where this is allowed  will be asked to give a specific 
consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a cont racted partner to use the samples for further research. 
Further  research will be subject to prior EC/IRB approval if required per local legislation.  
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from [COMPANY_004].  
Any sample testing wil l be done in line with the consent of the individual 
subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , wher e it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform any other biological assays except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s).  
If additional testing is performed, the marker priority ranking given in Section 8.4.4  may 
be changed.  
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formally to and discussed 
and agreed with [COMPANY_004].   
8.4.1.  Use of specified study materials  
When materials are provided by [CONTACT_23983], it is MANDATORY  that all clinical samples 
(including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in 
the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the 
subject from the per -protocol analysis (See Section 10.2 for the definition of populations  
for analyses ). The investigator must ensure that his/her personne l and the laboratory(ies) 
under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. However, when [COMPANY_004] does not 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

[IP_ADDRESS].  Blood sampling for effectiveness and immunogenicity response 
assessments  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
A minimum  of approximately  [ADDRESS_615980] vaccination [at Visit 2 (Day 31)  and Visit 6 
(Day 211) ] and approximately [ADDRESS_615981] s 
30 days after the second vaccina tion (at Visit 4 (Day 91)). 
The blood samples should be collected before the study  vaccination when applicable. The 
blood volume that is drawn as presented in Table 11 is needed in  order to provide the 
necess ary serum volume for the bactericidal  assays  (enc-hSBA and hSBA (s)). Refer to 
Section 5.1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for further details on the rationale for the requirement of 
this blood volume.  
Chec k criteria for blood draw delay as specified in Section 6.3. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_479619]  (e.g. 
EMLA adhesives or cream) may be used at the site of blood sample draw, according to 
local practice in order to minim ise pain.  
The blood will be processed as descr ibed in the SPM  and/or Central Laboratory Manual . 
The serum will be stored at a temperature of  -80°C ( -70°C is accepted but -80°C is 
preferred) . Each serum tube will be identified  with a Central Laboratory  label and  sent to 
Central Laboratory per defined frequency . Complete instruct ions for labelling  and storage of 
serum samples are included in the SPM  and/or Central Laboratory Manual . 
The total amount of blood collected over the study  period per subject will be 
approximately  105mL. 
Insufficient blood volume may lead to test cancellation and jeopard ise the statistical 
power. Hence, every effort must be done to collect blood volume as per protocol 
requirements  
Note: Blood samples are taken from all subjects irrespective of the testing status to maintain 
the blind of the study. Refer to Section 8.4 for detail s on how the unused/ left -over samples 
will be used .  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

8.4.3.  Laboratory assays  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
Serum bactericidal activity is a functional measure of the ability of antibodies, in 
conjunction with human complement, to kill meningococci, and it is widely accepted as 
the serological surrogate marker for protection.  
Effectiveness of the MenB component  will be evaluated with serum bactericidal assays 
using endogenous source of human complement (enc -hSBA), on a panel of [ADDRESS_615986] serogroups A, B, C, W and Y will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_479687] s using exogenous source of human complement (hSBA s), using 
indicator strains representing serogroups A, B, C, W and Y.  
An Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA ), or equivalent,  will b e used to 
evaluate  the serotype -specific IgG responses to A, C, W, and Y . The intent is to 
characterize  whether  the immunogenicity measured by [CONTACT_479688], C, W and 
Y indicator strains may be confounded by [CONTACT_479689]. The ELISA procedure is used to detect the 
amount of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in response to specific N. 
meningitidis  polysaccharide antigens . 
Effectiveness  testing by [CONTACT_479657] -hSBA and MenACWY immunogenicity tes ting by  [CONTACT_479690] ,

9 May 2021  83 [IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification of an SAE by [CONTACT_479696] a 
study treatment under clinical investigation.  
The sponsor has a legal r esponsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting  to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory re quirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e .g. summary or listing of SAE s) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.   
8.5.7.  Follow -up of A Es and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject  at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAE  and non -serious AESI s (Refer Section 
12.5.6  for definition) , will be followed until the event is resolved, stabili sed, otherwise  
explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up. Further information on follow -up 
procedures is given in  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
8.5.8.  Treatment of adverse events  
Treatment of any AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice. Any medication administered for the treatment of a  SAE / AESI  
should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject’s eCRF (refer to 
Section 7.5). 
8.5.9.  Subject card  
Study subjects /subjects’ par ent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and 
telephone number of the main contact [CONTACT_43089].  
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each 
subject /subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s). In an emergency situation , this card serves to inform 
the responsible attending physician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant 
information may be obtained by [CONTACT_21947].  
Subjects /subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed  to keep subject cards in their 
possession at all times during the study duration.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation and prompt repor ting 
of any medical device deficiency occurring during the study to [COMPANY_004]. This applies to 
any medical device provided for the conduct of the study.   
Device deficiencies will be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the investigator 
determines that the event  meets the protocol definition of a device deficiency. Refer to 
Section 12.8 for definitions and details on recording and reporting of these events.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any additional investigations to 
elucidate the nature and/or relat ed of the device deficiency to the incident. Follow -up 
applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention or the 
study.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all 
changes signed and da ted by [CONTACT_479697] 24 hours . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory reporting of medical device deficiency when used as 
combination product  
The investigator will promptly report all device deficiencies occurring with any medical 
device provided for us e in the study to [COMPANY_004]. [COMPANY_004] has a legal responsibility to notify 
appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about safety information linked to 
medical devices being used in clinical studies. Refer to Section 12.8.2  for details of 
reporting.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g. the head 
of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory 
requi rements relating to the reporting of device deficiencies to the IRB/IEC.

The study termina tion call will occur  on Day 361. The termina tion visit will be a phone 
call (also in case of early termination of the study).  
The date of termina tion is the date of the last contact (telephone call) in which the 
subject’s health status was assessed or, in cases where the subject does not agree to any 
further safety follow -up, it is the date consent is withdrawn. This date should be recorded 
on the termi nation eCRF page. For visit procedures to be performed for a subject whose 
planned study participation ends prematurely, please see  Section 8.8.1 . 
During the phone call  at the end of the study  (Day 361), the following procedures will be 
performed: interview of subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to collect SAEs, 
AESIs, medically attended AEs, pregnancies and/or  concomitant medications/ 
vaccinations.  
The site will review  with the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) the plan of when 
infor mation relating to the subject’s par ticipa tion in the study may be available (e.g., 
study results, treatment assignments). It will also be discussed how information rela ting 
to the subject’s participation in the study  will be share d with the subject’s  healthcare 
provider, if the subject and/ or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) chooses to share this 
infor mation.

During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. For the duration of such special circumstances, the 
following measures may be implemented for enrolled subjects:  
• If the Subject eDiary device was provided to the subject , it may be returned to the 
site by [CONTACT_31870] (Visit 6). 
• Study visit s may be per formed  at a different location* other than the study site (e.g. 
at subject ’s home ). For study visits involving blood draw, b iological samples should 
not be collected if they cannot be processed in a timely manner or appropriately 
stored until the intended use.  
• If despi[INVESTIGATOR_479623] (see Table 4), then the interval may be extended 
as described below in Table 17.  
• If despi[INVESTIGATOR_31794] (see Table 4), then the interval may be extended as described

10. STATISTICAL C ONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.  Sample size determination  
(Amended 9 May  2021) 
Three thousand six hundred fifty-one (3,651) subjects are to be enrolled in the study. 
Figure 1 presents the study design overview with the breakdown of sample size per study 
arm:  
• MenB_0_2_6: 912 subjects  
• MenB_0_6: 912 subjects  
• ABCWY -1: 548 subjects  
• ABCWY -2: 548 subjects  
• ABCWY -3: 548 subjects  
• ACWY: 1 83 subjects.  
It is assumed that 25% of the subjects will drop -out and not contribute to an evaluable 
result. The remaining subjects who do give an evaluable result provide 90% power to 
reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of rMenB +OMV NZ  and 92% power to 
reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of MenABCWY vaccine. Additionally, 
the study is powered to reject key secondary objective for three N. meningitidis  serogroup 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

An explanation of the testing strategy and hypotheses can be found in Section 10.1.1  and 
its sub -sections. A breakdown of the power for the individual objectives can be found in 
Section 10.1.2  and its sub -sections.  
10.1.1.  Hypothesis testing strategy  
Multiple objectives and endpoints require type I error control. Full alpha (0.05) is split 
equally (alpha=0.025) between rMenB+OMV NZ  objectives and MenABCWY 
objectives. Furthermore, within rMenB+OMV NZ, as well as within MenABCWY, 
objectives are tested hierarchically. If the first null hypothesis is rejected, then the testing 
will continue with the second hypothesis at same alpha. Same for 3rd, 4th, and so forth. 
Whenever a null hypothesis is not reje cted, then the testing will stop.  
As the comparator for MenABCWY non inferiority objective for the B component will 
be the selected  schedule of rMenB+OMV NZ  as determined in this study, the objectives 
of rMenB+OMV NZ  will be analysed first. Additionally, i f all null hypotheses related to 
rMenB+OMV NZ  objectives will be rejected, the alpha (alpha=0.025) will be propagated 
to the MenABCWY part, and hypotheses related to MenABCWY objectives will be 
tested at full alpha (alpha=0.05). See Figure 2 for an explanation of the hierarchical 
testing (top to bottom, the order indicated by [CONTACT_37296]).  
Figure 2 Hierarchical testing of hypothesis

Overall study sample size and its power is provided in Section  10.1. This sub -section 
provides a breakdown of the power calculation for each of the objectives. All calculations 
are based on number of evaluable subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vaccine effectiveness (Test -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  - 3 dose s (0,2,6 -
months schedule)  
The planned  (target)  number of strains to be tested for each subject will be 35 strains. A 
minimum amount of 5 mL of serum needs to be available to perform enc -hSBA testing.  
In case the  volume of serum shipped to the laboratory for enc -hSBA testing  is <[ADDRESS_616005]  a minimum 
number of 20 strains. Otherwise no enc -hSBA testing will be performed with the specific 
sample . The power was calculated for two situations: [ADDRESS_616006].  
In study V102_16E1, the observed raw percentages of samples without bactericidal 
serum activity at 1:4 dilution were 77 .8% in the MenACWY vaccine group and 21.9% in 
the MenABCWY group one -month post 3rd vaccination. The estimated VE of 
MenABCWY compared to  MenACWY was 71% (95% CI: 69% - 73%). For the sample 
size calculations, it is assumed that MenB (any schedule) will have similar results as 
MenABCWY 0,2,6 -months.  
Table 18 shows the result of power calculation for a group size of  684 evaluable subjects 
in MenB group, (any schedule) and 137 subjects in MenACWY group. The percentage of 
tests without bactericidal serum activi ty for MenACWY is assumed to be  75% , while the 
estimation for MenB is 22%. Sample size calculations revealed  >99.9% power to show 
that the lower limit of the two-sided 97.5%  CI for the VE is >65% (Refer to Section

Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or 
misuse.  
Adverse Event of 
Special Interest:  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs): are predefined 
(serious or non -serious) adverse events of scientific and 
medical c oncern specific to the product or program, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_429447], because such 
an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
character ise and understand it.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which [ADDRESS_616027] and the site and 
sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
subjects are blinded while other study personnel may be 
aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 7.3 for details 
on observer -blinded studies).   
Certified copy:  A copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the 
original record that has been verified (i.e. by a dated 
signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_479714] a validated process) to 
have the same information, including data that describe the 
context, content , and structure, as the original.  
Child in care:  A child who has been placed under the control or protection 
of an agency, organ isation, ins titution or entity by [CONTACT_285135], 
the government or a government body, acting in accordance 
with powers conferred on them by [CONTACT_6617]. The

bactericidal assay – rMenB + O MV NZ  
The measures of vaccine effectiveness against 110 invasive disease serogroup B strains 
will be based on the qualified endogenous complement serum bactericidal assay  (enc-
hSBA ). 
The qualified  enc-hSBA assay provides a qualitative assessment (yes/no) of the presence

study, test sera will be diluted 1:[ADDRESS_616031] to a traditional human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) which heat 
inactivates the intrinsic complement proteins and uses an external source of human donor 
complement for each serum sample.  
The enc -hSBA will be performed for each subject against a target number of 35 strains . A 
minimum amount of 5 mL of serum needs to be a vailable to perform enc -hSBA testing.

(hSBA):  
Serum bacteri cidal activity against MenACWY will be determined by [CONTACT_2329] a validated 
agar-overlay hSBA.  
This hSBA is based on the measurement of human complement -dependent bactericidal 
killing of meningococci. As with all functional hSBAs, the assay includes a first step of 
heat inactivation of the human serum samples to inactivate the endogenous complement, 
followed by [CONTACT_479721] a fixed amount of bacteria and 
of human exogenous complement are added. The reactions are incubated to a llow the 
association of meningococcal specific antibodies and their target antigen. The antibody -
antigen complex activates the classical pathway of complement which ultimately results 
in bacterial lysis.  
As a measure of the meningococcal specific antibody titre of each serum sample, the 
MenACWY agar -overlay hSBA follows the principle of detecting and counting the 
surviving meningococcal bacteria after bacterial growth within solid agar media, using an 
automatic colony counter (detection of colony forming un its, CFU).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

"Assent" is a term used to express willingness to participate in research by  [CONTACT_9702] s who 
are by [CONTACT_479723], its expected risks and possible benefits, and 
the activi ties expected  of them  as subjects.  Assent  by [CONTACT_479724], however. If 
assen t is given, informed consent must still be obtained from the subject's parent(s) or 
legal guardian(s). Local laws define who constitutes a "child," and such defini tions 
dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a protocol [Levine , 
1988 ]. 
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the

12.4.9.  Data quality a ssurance  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
The investigator should maintain a record of the location(s) of their r espective essential 
documents including source documents (see Glossary of terms  for the exact definition of  
essential and source documents). The storage system used during the trial and for 
archiving (irrespective of the type of media used) should provide for document 
identification, version history, search, and retrieval.  
Essential documents for the trial may be added or reduced where justified (in advance of 
trial initiation) based on the importance and relevance to the trial. When a copy is used to 
replace an original document (e.g. source documents, CRF), the copy should fulfil the 
requirements for certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (see Glossary of terms  for the exact d efinition of

in the eCRF . 
The investigator must permit study -related monit oring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source documents or certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the source data  (see Glossary of terms  for the exact definition of 
source data ). 
Study monitors will follow the Monitoring Plan to  perform ongoing source data 
verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by [CONTACT_479726], legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete . Changes to 
source data should be traceable, should not obscure th e original entry, and should be 
explained if necessary (e.g. via an audit trail). Safety and rights of subjects must be  
protected  and study be conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and 
any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all app licable regulatory requirements.  
Quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be pre -defined in the  study management plan  to 
identify systematic issues that can impact participant safety and/or the reliability of 
study results. These pre -defined parameters will be  monitored during the study. 
Important deviations from the QTLs and remedial actions taken will be summarised in 
the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Trial records and source documents, including signed ICF, pertaining to the conduct of 
this study must be reta ined by [CONTACT_1732] 25 years from the issue of the final 
Clinical Study Report (CSR) /equivalent summary  unless local regulations or institutional 
policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the 
retention period w ithout the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be 
transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor.  
12.4.10.  Source d ocuments  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Investigator should maintain a record of the location(s) of 
their source documents.   
Data entered in the eCRF  that are transcribed from  source documents must be consistent 
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may 
need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. 
Also, current medical records must be availabl e.

9 May 2021  128 12.4.11.  Study and s ite closure  
[COMPANY_004] or its designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of [COMPANY_004] , provided there is sufficient notice given 
to account for patient’s safe exit from study participation . Study sites  regular closure  will 
be upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required 
data/documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has 
been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any  time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_103086]:  
− Failure of the investigator to  comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
− Inadequate recruitment of subject s by [CONTACT_093]  
− Discontinuation of further study treatment development

12.5.  Appendix  5: Adverse Events: definitions and procedures for 
recordi ng, evaluating, follow -up, and r eporting  
12.5.1.  Definition of AE  
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the 
study treatment.  
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavo urable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), sy mptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Examples of e vents Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chro nic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
administration even though they may have been present prior to th e start of the study.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  129 • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
vaccine(s)/product(s ) or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).  
• Signs, symptoms temporally associated with study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
administration.  
• Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action.  
• Pre- or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated pr ocedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
• Signs, symptoms that require medical attention (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], physician visits 
and emergency room visits).  
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) a re described in Section  12.5.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack  of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Examples of e vents NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a su bject prior to the 
first study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section 
of the eCRF . 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.  
12.5.2.  Definition of SAE  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death,  
b. Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479630], 
Note: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479631]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  130 that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479632]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479633], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639]’ occurred , or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479634] a pre -existing condition  (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, OR  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.  
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in  other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479635] d in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639].

additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of day, 
subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to record the highest temperature in 
the eDiary .  
Note: If the body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_310247] ( other th an oral ), this also 
needs to be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
12.5.4.  Other solicited adverse  events  
The use of analgesics/antipyretics for either prophylactic or treatment purposes will be 
recorded as other solicited events in the Subject eDiary and subsequentl y recorded onto 
the eCRFs and subject medical records.  
The study staff must review the data entered into the Subject eDiary as described in 
Section 12.5.9 . 
12.5.5.  Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not solicited using an eDiary and that was 
spontaneously communicated by a subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) who has signed the 
informe d consent.  
Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., symptoms or illnesses 
requiring a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343639], or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). 
The subjects/ subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact  [CONTACT_479727](s), as well as any events that, though not 
medically attended, are of subject/ parental /LAR’s concern. Detailed information about 
reported unsolicited AEs will be collected by [CONTACT_479728] ’s records.

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are predefined (serious or non -serious) 
adverse events of scientific and medical concern specific to the product or pro gram, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_479730], because such an event might warrant further investigation in order to

[IP_ADDRESS].  Arthritis  
Cases of arthritis are defined  according to the following ad -hoc definition:  
• Presence of a physical exam findings of swelling, redness, heat, or limitation in 
range of motion and/or  
• Presence of a diagnostic imaging studies interpreted by a health care provider as 
demonstrating evidence  of joint inflammation and/or arthrocentesis results 
evidencing inflammation.  
Due to the heterogeneity of the presentation of arthritis which can be either acute or 
chronic, the threshold of duration of [ADDRESS_616041] of PTs corresponding to the diagnosis of arthritis, are those included in the 
MedDRA SMQ Narrow “Arthritis”. For any new diagnosis of arthritis (serious or non -
serious) in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete, an electronic 
Expedited Adv erse Events Report and an ad -hoc eCRF page on arthritis to further 
character ise this AESI.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Potential immune -mediated diseases  
Potential immune -mediated diseases (pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]) are a subset of AESIs that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or ne urologic disorders of interest 
which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. AEs that need to be recorded and 
reported as pI[INVESTIGATOR_479636] 27. 
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathophysiology 
involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and shou ld also be 
recorded as a pI[CONTACT_28839].  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then re cord all relevant information regarding an

0 : < 38.0°C  (100.4℉)  
1 : ≥ 38.0 (100.4°F)  - 38.9°C  (102.1°F)

3 : ≥ 40.0°C  (104.0°F)   
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categor ies: 
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities  
(in a young child, such an AE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at school/kindergarten/a day -care centre and would 
cause the parent(s)/LAR(s) to seek medical advice. In 
adults/adolescents, such an AE w ould, for example, prevent 
attendance at work/school and would necessitate the 
administration of corrective therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category used for rating the intensity of an e vent; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in Section  12.5.2 . 
Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study 
vaccine(s)/product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. In 
case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the 
investigator should specify if the AE could be causally related to a specific 
vaccine/product administered (i.e . investigational, control/placebo or co -administered 
vaccine). When causal relationship to a specific vaccin e(s)/product(s) cannot be 
determined,  the investigator should indicate the AE to be related to all products.  
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relatio nship of the event to the 
study vaccine(s)/product(s) will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also 
consult the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to 
determine his/her assessment.  
There may be situations w hen a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004]. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission 
of the Expedited Ad verse Events Report to [COMPANY_004]. The investigator  may change his/her 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

All solicited  local and systemic  AEs will be considered causally related to vaccination . 
Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by [CONTACT_479734]:   
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have bee n caused by [CONTACT_175074]/product?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
contributed to the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study vaccine( s)/product(s) . There are other, more 
likely causes and administration of the study vaccine(s)/product(s) is 
not suspected to have contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section  12.5.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_479735].  
Possible contributing factors  include:  
• Medical history.

12.6.1.  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permane ntly sterile (see below)  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a young female and is preceded 
by [CONTACT_301950]. Menarche usually occurs within [ADDRESS_616052] development (palpable glandular breast tissue).  
• Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral  oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contrac eption or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use [ADDRESS_616053] discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment.  
12.6.2.  Contraception g uidance  
• Female subjects of childbearing potential are e ligible to participate if they agree to 
use an adequate contraception consistently and correctly according to the methods 
listed in [COMPANY_004] list of highly effective contraceptive methods provided  in Table 29. 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomi sed partner  
(A vasectomi sed partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual 
partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of 
contraceptio n should be used. )  
Male partner steril isation prior to the female subject’s entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that 
subject,  
(The information on the male sterility can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medica l records; 
medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by [CONTACT_163596]).  
Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse 
during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to  the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)

12.8.1.  Definition of medical device AE and adverse device effect (ADE)  
• Medi cal device AE is any untoward medical occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorab le and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medical device. This definition includes events related 
to the medical device or comparator and events relat ed to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. 
This definition includes any AE resulting from:  
− insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user error), or  
− any malfunction of a medical device, or  
− intentional misuse of the medical device.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  151 12.8.2.  Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and [LOCATION_003]DE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either  resulted 
in: 
− A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the 
definition of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
− A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
− Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17450] a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without s erious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
− Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
c. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
d. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had 
not been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE) definition  
• An [LOCATION_003]DE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome 
has not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
12.8.3.  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and 
[LOCATION_003]DE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.

9 May 2021  157 In Section 5 Study design ; Section 5.1 Scientific rationale for study design:  
Rationale for blood volume collected:  
In order to provide the necessary serum volume for the bactericidal assays (enc -hSBA 
and/ or hSBA(s)), and ELISA  (or equivalent ), approximately  30 mL whole blood will be 
collected at Visit 2 and Visit 6 and approximately 25 mL whole blood will be collected 
at Visit 2,  Visit 4 and Visit 6 . At pre-vaccination (Visit 1), 20 mL whole blood will be 
collected to provide the necessary serum  volume for the hSBA  and ELISA (or 
equivalent ). 
In Section 6.3 Criteria for temporary delay for enrolment and vaccination and/or 
blood sampling : 
*In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g.: a 
pandemic) is organised by [CONTACT_43068], outside the routine immunisation 
program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that va ccine 
provided it is licensed and used according to its Prescribing Information and according to  
the local governmental recommendations and provided a written approval of  that the 
Sponsor is obtained  notified accordingly.

In Section [IP_ADDRESS], Blood sampling for effectiveness and immunogenicity response 
assessments : 
A minimum  of approximately  [ADDRESS_616062] vaccination [at Visit 2 (Day 31)  and Visit 6 
(Day 211) ] and approximately  [ADDRESS_616063]  vaccina tion (at Visit 2 (Day 31), Visit 4 (Day 91) 
and Visit 6 (Day 211) ). 
The blood samples should be collected before the study vaccination when applicable. The 
blood volume of 25 mL at Visit 2,  Visit 4 and Visit 6  that is drawn as presented in Table 
11 is needed in order to provide the necessary serum volume for the bactericidal assays 
(enc-hSBA and hSBA(s)). Refer to Section 5.1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for further details on 
the rationale for the requirement of this bl ood volume.  
The total amount of blood collected over the study  period per subject will be

serious adverse device effect (SADE) and unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
12.8.[ADDRESS_616079] (ADE)  
• Medical device AE is any untoward medi cal occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medical device. This definition includes events related 
to the medical d evice or comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. 
This definition includes any AE resulting from:  
• insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user er ror), or  
• any malfunction of a medical device, or  
• intentional misuse of the medical device.  
12.8.2  Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and [LOCATION_003]DE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
e. Led to death  
f. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted 
in: 
• A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the 
definition of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refe r to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
• Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17450] a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure  required by [CONTACT_760], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
• Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
g. Led to fetal distre ss, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0
CONFIDENTIAL  
205416 [MENB REC  2ND GEN -038 (V72_72)]  
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_616080] (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had 
not been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE ([LOCATION_003]DE) definition  
• An [LOCATION_003]DE (also  identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome 
has not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
12.8.3  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs,  SADEs and [LOCATION_003]DE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to [COMPANY_004] within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination 
product w ith device deficiency/incident report form’ is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of ‘Medical device or comb ination product 
with device deficiency/incident report form’ sent by [CONTACT_13187].  
• Contacts for reporting can be found in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[COMPANY_004] will review all device deficiencies, determine and document in writing whether 
they could ha ve led to an SAE. These device deficiencies will be reported to the 
regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by [CONTACT_2091].

In 2013, the [LOCATION_002] ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed with the 
Company proposal to evaluate meningococcal B vaccine effectiveness against a large 
panel of the US epi[INVESTIGATOR_479643]  (N. meningitidis) serogroup  B in adolescents using serum bactericidal assay 
with endogenous human complement (enc -hSBA). This panel includes 110 serogroup B 
strains selected from the original panel of 442 endemic strains identified as appropriately 
representative of invasive meningo coccal serogroup B strains detected in the US by [CONTACT_479664] (CDC) [Welsch, 2018]. Following licensure of Bexsero  
(rMenB+OMV NZ) in the US in 2015, under accelerated approval regulations, [COMPANY_004] was 
requested to demonstrate effectivenes s of Bexsero  via a post -approval confirmatory trial

Section 5.1  Scientific rationale for study design  
As the rMenB+OMV NZ licensure in the US was issued through accelerated approval, 
the FDA has requested to demonstrate the e ffectiveness of the vaccine against an 
extended panel of serogroup B meningococcal strains (MenB) as a post -marketing 
commitment in US adolescents and young adults, thus confirming that the vaccine can 
protect against diverse meningococcal B strains preval ent in the [LOCATION_002] US.  
The availability of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would 
however reduce the number of injections and could increase coverage for meningococcal 
disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y worldwide. [COMPANY_004]’s 
investigational MenABCWY combination vaccine is intended to protect against [ADDRESS_616114] prevalent serogroups of Neisseria  N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans.  
Rationale for the selected vaccination sch edules  
rMenB+OMV NZ: This study aims at to demonstrate demonstrating  the VE of the 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine administered as 2 -dose vaccine, either with a shorter interval 
(0,2-months) or a prolonged interval (0,6 -months) between doses. A [ADDRESS_616115] approval requirement from the US FDA .

• MenB_0_2_6 group *: subjects will receive 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ at Day 1, 
Day 61 and Day 181 ( 0,2 and  0,2,6 -months schedule). These subjects will receive 1 
dose of the MenACWY at Day 211* *. Data from this group will be used to assess 
both the 0,2 -months and 0,2,6 -months sc hedules; the 0,2 -months schedule will be 
assessed 1 month after the second rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination administered at

Day 181 and 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 61 (0,6 -months schedule). These 
subjects will receive 1 dose of the placebo at Day 211* *. 
• ABCWY -1**: subjects will receive  2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months apart 
(0,6-months schedule), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 1 of the MenACWY lyophilised

The target will be to enrol a total of 3651 eligible subjects who will be randomly assigned 
to 6 study groups in a 5:5:3:3:3:1 ratio (912 each in MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 groups, 
548 in each ABCWY group and 183 in ACWY group).  
Allocation of the subject to a study group/a treatme nt number at the investigator site will 
be performed using a randomisation system on internet (SBIR). The randomisation 
algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting for study, region (US and ex -US 
countries) , previous MenACWY vaccination? (Yes an d No)*, and age category (10 -17 
years of age and 18 -25 years of age). Minimisation factors will have equal weight in the 
minimisation algorithm.  
To ensure adequate representation in the US in line with the post -marketing commitment 
(Section 3.1), a minimum  of 30% of adolescents and young adults will be enrolled in the 
US. 
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF/IAF from the subject/subject’s parent/LAR and 
having checked the eligibility of the subject, the blinded  site staff in charge of the 
vaccine/produc t administration will access SBIR. Upon providing the subject 
identification number, the subject’s age category and previous MenACWY vaccination? 
(Yes/ No)*, the randomisation system will determine the study group and will provide the 
treatment number to b e used for each dose. Region does not have to be given as an input 
by [CONTACT_479745].   
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
When SBIR is not availab le, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions.  
If for any reason, after randomisation the subject fails to undergo treatment, this is an 
early Termination and the reason should be recorded in source document as specified in 
the SDA.  
Note that enrolment will be frozen  as soon as the target number s (Table 7) are reached  
in a group has been reached . Refer to the SPM for further details . (refer to Table 7), the 
enrolment will be frozen for this group.

sample of sufficient volume for testing.  
• These strains were randomly ordered into a testing sequence. This testing sequence 
will be used to define a list of strains to be tested for each subject. Within each study 
group, each subject will be randomly assigned to a start strain in the pre -ordered  
sequence of 110 invasive disease serogroup B strains (e.g., strain 1 or 5 or 101). The 
randomisation algorithm will use a block size of 110 (i.e., a start strain will not be 
repeated for 110 subjects within each block), to ensure as much as possible, a si milar 
number of subjects tested for each strain.  
• The target number of strains to be tested for each subject will be 35 strains.  
• The serum sample collected from each subject will be sent on an ongoing basis to 
[COMPANY_004] Clinical Laboratory Sciences or to laborato ries delegated by [CONTACT_479746]. Aliquots for immunogenicity 
and enc -hSBA testing will be prepared depending on the serum volume available for 
a visit from one subject. A minimum amount of 5 mL of ser um needs to be available 
to confirm eligibility to perform enc -hSBA testing. Additional instruction on the

Section 8.4 Effectiveness and/or immunogenicity assessments  
Future findings may make it desirable to use the samples acquired in this study for future 
further  research, not described in this protocol. Additional serological testing may be 
performed in the future to further characterise the antibody response to the antigens 
included in the study vaccines or hSBA against an additional  panel of strains of Neisseria  
species.  
Therefore, all subjects in countries where this is allowed  will be asked to give a specific 
consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted partner to use the samples for future further  
research. Future Further  research will be subject to prior EC/IRB approval if required 
per local legislation.  
Section 8.4.3 Laboratory assays  
An Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) will be used to evaluate the

Overall Rationale for the Amendment /Administrative change : As per the 
recommendation from Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) [IND 
[ZIP_CODE] Amendments 257, 283 – CBER comments on Study Protocol V72_72 Version 1, 
dated February 08, 2019], the scope of the study has been extended to include the 3 -dose 
(0-,2-,6-month) schedule and an additional 2 -dose schedule (0 -,6-month) along with the 
2-dose (0 -,2-month) schedule planned originally. The study will assess the 
immunogenicity of the 2 -dose and 3 -doses vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine 
along with effec tiveness and safety.

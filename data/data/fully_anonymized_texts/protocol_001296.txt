1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
 
The aim of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_486846] t o collect preliminary data on the  feasibility, acceptance, and  
efficacy of an SLP -administered psychosocial intervention for people with post -stroke aphasia.  The main 
objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_549157] , and we predict that it will be. Regarding the efficacy of 
intervention itself, we hypothesize that the psychosocial intervention will result in lower levels of 
psychosocial impairment (e.g., symptoms of anxiety and depression, chronic stress), better qu ality of life, 
and better retention and adherence to rehabilitation activities (i.e., attending therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_718793] of stroke survivors and affects the 
ability to speak, listen, read, and/or write. Aphasia can have devastating effects on functional 
communication and quality of life. Consequently, stroke survi vors with aphasia are at much higher risk 
for depression than stroke survivors without aphasia. Approximately 70% of stroke survivors with aphasia 
experience depression post -stroke (Kauhanen et al., 2000), whereas only about one -third of the broader 
stroke  population experience depression after their stroke (Mitchell et al., 2017). Anxiety disorders are 
also common in aphasia with prevalence estimated at 44% (Morris et al., 2017). Moreover, psychosocial 
problems like depression and anxiety negatively affect  aphasia rehabilitation outcomes (Fucetola et al., 
2006) and quality of life post -stroke (Ayerbe et al., 2014; Donnellan et al., 2010) likely, in part, due to 
low retention in and adherence to rehabilitation activities.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_549158], their mental health 
needs are not being met (Baker et al., 2021; Strong & Randolph, 2021).  One reason for this problem is 
that there are not many psychological interventions that have been adapted for people with aphasia and 
experimentally validated for this population (Baker et al., 2018). Traditional psychological interventions 
are heavily language -based making them less a ccessible to people with aphasia. The stepped care model 
for psychological care after stroke described by [CONTACT_549168] (2016) is a framework proposed in the United 
Kingdom ([LOCATION_006]) to target mental health problems in patients based on their individual needs. All stroke 
survivors enter Level 1 of the stepped care model, w hich is meant to prevent emotional problems. At 
Level 1, patients receive screening/assessment for psychosocial issues, psychoeducation, goal setting, 
problem solving, and monitoring of mood. Patients are moved up to Levels 2 -4, depending on their 
diagnosi s (Level 2: mild -moderate psychosocial impairment, Level 3: moderate -severe symptoms, Level 
4: severe symptoms with challenging behaviors). Within this framework, patients may receive 
interventions at Levels 1 and 2 by [CONTACT_105] -mental health professionals, incl uding SLPs or other 
paraprofessionals (Montgomery et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2019). A systematic review examining 
interventions that target psychosocial wellbeing in post -stroke aphasia identified psychological 
interventions that fit within Levels 1 and 2 of the stepped care model that may be appropriate for people 
with aphasia (Baker et al., 2018). However, because the included studies examined stroke patients with 
and without aphasia within the same sample, it was unclear to what degree the subpopulation of people 
with aphasia benefited from these interventions. Furthermore, whether these interventions could feasibly 
be implemented by [CONTACT_549169]. SLPs are uniquely positioned to be a “first -responder” to 
people with aphasia’s mental health needs  given their expertise in communication and their understanding 
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/[ADDRESS_718794] of aphasia on mental health and daily life (Ryan et al., 2019). Specifically, equippi[INVESTIGATOR_549159] [ADDRESS_718795] examined  psychosocial intervention s for people with aphasia , some  are not 
meant to be administered by [CONTACT_549170] (Thomas et al., 2012), and all require sessions that are 1 -2 hours in 
length (Ryan et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2019) . Furthermore, to our knowledge, no 
SLP-administered psychosocial intervention s for PWA have been tested in the [LOCATION_002]. Given the 
state of the health system in the [LOCATION_002], a psychosocial intervention that requires several weeks of 
1-[ADDRESS_718796].  Intervention 
sessions are designed to be about 30 minutes, and thus, potentially more feasible for clinicians if it is 
found to be effective.   
 
3.0 Intervention  to be studied  
Included participants with aphasia will engage in weekly sessions of an SLP -administered 
psychosocial intervention for 8 weeks. Activities to be completed throughout the intervention are 
outlined in detail below. Throughout the intervention, supported communications strategies will be 
used to facilitate communication with people with aphasia, according to their communication 
needs/aphasia severity.  
The psychosocial intervention includes psychoeducation, behavioral activation therapy, 
education on sleep hygiene, and relaxation training. Psychoeducation has been shown to be 
effective at improving the clinical course, treatment adherence, and psychosocial functioning of 
depressed patients (Souza Tursi et al., 2013). In stroke, specifically, psychoeducation has been 
shown to improve functional outcomes of patients, reduce caregiver burden, and improve stroke 
survivors’ quality of life (Cheng et al., 2018;  Mou et al., 2021). Behavioral activation therapy is 
rooted in the idea that depression and low mood arise from a lack of reinforcement from the 
environment and the activities that one partakes in. Behavioral activation therapy has been shown 
to be an effective treatment for depression in adults ( Chan et al., 2017; Mazzucchelli  et al., 2009; 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_549160]., 2007; Scogin et al., 2005; Soucy Chartier & Provencher, 2013), comparable to the 
effects of cognitive behavioral therapy in treating depression ( Cuijpers et al., 2013;  Richards et al.,  
2016 ). It has also been tested in the [LOCATION_006] with people with aphasia and has been shown to be 
effective  and appropriate for this population  as it does not rely as heavily on verbal 
communication as other approaches  (Thomas et al., 2013; Thomas et al., 2019) . Stroke survivors 
are at risk for sleep  disturbances and poor quality of sleep (Zhao et al., 2022), which can affect 
their cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Education on sleep hygiene as part of stroke 
education may result in higher sleep quality and quality of life (Urcan & Kolcu, 2022).  Finally, 
relaxation training has been shown to be an appropriate intervention for people with aphasia ( El-
Helou et al., 2022; Ryan et al., 2020) and has been shown to be effective in reducing post -stroke 
anxiety (Golding et al., 2015) and potentially an e ffective adjuvant to language therapy ( Marshal 
& Watts, 1976; Murray & Ray, 2001).  
Below we outline what will occur in each  intervention  session with participants.  
Intervention Session 1 : Session [ADDRESS_718797] approximately 30 minutes  and focus on 
psychoeducation and an introduction to behavioral activation therapy . Session agenda:

 Page 4 of 18  • Assessments  (5 minutes) :  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983)  
o Dynamic Visual Analog Mood Scale (D -VAMS; 
http://dvams.com/dvams/menu_home_dvams.htm ; Barrows, 2013)  
o Simple Aphasia Stress Scale (SASS; Laures -Gore & Rice, 2019)  
• Participants will receive psychoeducation focused on  (10 minutes) : 
o normalizing the participant’s psychosocial symptoms (e.g., loss of identity, 
depression, anxiety) and emotions (e.g., grief, anger, guilt , fear, embarrassment, 
etc.), which are common after stroke.  
o Discuss common effects of stroke/aphasia on daily life (e.g., social isolation, 
relationships, work, daily activities).  
o Discuss ways that depression, anxiety, or low mood can affect rehabilitation (e.g., 
attendance, homework completion, low engagement/motivation, perhaps less 
neuroplasticity)  
• Participants will be introduced to the concept of behavioral activation therapy and the goal 
to increase the number of enjoyable activities that the participant partakes in. Participants 
will be asked what types of activities they enjoyed before their stroke , the activities /roles in 
their lives that they value, and the barriers they’ve faced to engaging in these activities . A 
list will be started of activities they enjoy/value and used throughout the intervention.  (15 
minutes)  
• Homework : activity monitoring for participants to track how they currently spend their 
time and their mood during each activity  with the help of a care partner  if available .  
 
Intervention Session 2 : This session will last about [ADDRESS_718798] of ongoing 
behavioral activation therapy and education on sleep hygiene . 
• Assessments: HADS, D -VAMS , SASS  (5 minutes)  
• The SLP will go over the activity monitoring assignment with the participant and schedule 
valued/preferred activities with the participant for the following week.  Participants and the 
SLP will collaboratively problem solve as concerns about ability to engage in preferred 
activities arise. (20 minutes)  
• The SLP will educate the participant on the importance of sleep and sleep hygiene 
practices that can improve sleep. The SLP will suggest ways the participant can instill 
proper sleep hygiene into their routine. (10 minutes)  
• Homework : 1) engage in scheduled activities, 2) track mood after activities and take note 
of difficulties that arose in completing the activity, and 3) choose/implement one method 
for improving sleep hygiene.  
 
Intervention Session 3 : This session will last about [ADDRESS_718799] of ongoing 
behavioral activation therapy and relaxation training.  
• Assessments: HADS, D -VAMS , SASS  (5 minutes)  
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/24  
 Page 5 of 18  • The SLP will go over the participant’s homework to determine whether they completed the 
preferred activities  and sleep hygiene homework.  The SLP and participant will 
collaboratively problem solve to increase participation in these activities. Additional 
activities will be scheduled for the following week. (15 minutes)  
• The SLP will educate the participant on relaxation techniques, including deep breathing, 
positive visualization, progressive muscle relaxation, mindfulness techniques, and 
phone/tablet applications or websites that may help with this practice. (10 minutes)  
• Homework : 1) engage in scheduled activities with tracking, and 2) choose/implement one 
method for relaxation.  
 
Intervention Sessions 4 : These session s will last  about [ADDRESS_718800] of ongoing 
behavioral activation therapy.  
• Assessments: HADS, D -VAMS , SASS  (5 minutes)  
• The SLP will go over the participant’s homework to determine whether they completed the 
preferred activities and relaxation training homework. The SLP and participant will 
collaboratively problem solve to increase participation in these activities. Additio nal 
activities will be scheduled for the following week. (20 minutes)  
• Homework : 1) engage in scheduled activities with tracking  
 
Intervention Session 5: This session will last about [ADDRESS_718801] of ongoing 
behavioral activation therapy and planning for maintenance of activities.  
• Assessments: HADS, D -VAMS , SASS  (5 minutes)  
• The SLP will go over the participant’s  homework to determine whether they completed the 
preferred activities. The SLP and participant will collaboratively problem solve to increase 
participation in these activities  without the weekly accountability . Additional activities will 
be scheduled for the following week. (20 minutes)  
 
Three w eekly booster phone calls:  After the five intervention sessions and post -treatment 
assessments, we will conduct three weekly phone calls to discuss behavioral activation  activities 
and problem solve any issues participants  are having with completing pleasant/scheduled 
activities. These weekly phone calls will occur between the post -treatment assessment session and 
the 1 -month follow -up session.  
 
4.0 Study Endpoints (if applicable)  
 
Primary Outcome:  
The primary outcome measure will be HADS , which is a conventional, validated, and widely used 
measure of psychosocial functioning. This scale consists of 14 items, seven of which contribute to a 
depression scale and seven that contribute to an anxiety scale. Therefore, three scores can be derived from 
this measure: an overall score, depression score, and anxiety score. The overall score will be used as the 
primary outcome measure and this measure will be administered at baseline, at each weekly psychosocial 
intervention session , post -treatment , and at 1 -month follow u p. 
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/24  
 Page 6 of 18   
Secondary Outcomes:  
Secondary measures of psychosocial functioning that are specifically validated for the aphasia population 
will be administered as well , including the D -VAMS, SASS, Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire -
10 (SADQ -10; Sutcliffe & Lincoln, 1998) , Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety Scale (BOA; Kneebone et 
al., 2012; Linley -Adams et al., 2014 , Modified Perceived Stress Scale (mPSS; Hunting Pompon et al., 
2018) , Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life (SAQOL -39; Hilari et al., 2003) , and Communication Confidence 
Rating Sca le for Aphasia (CCRSA; Cherney et al., 2011; Babbitt et al., 2011) . Most of these will be 
administered  at baseline, post -treatment, and at 1 -month follow -up (see below for  a table with  the 
timepoints for each measure  and the rationale for inclusion ). Two of these outcome measures will be also 
administered at the weekly sessions, including the D-VAMS  and SASS .  
 
A questionnaire  related to attendance, retention and adherence to outpatient speech therapy services will 
also be collected at post -treatment to gather preliminary data on whether the psychosocial intervention 
was associated with good retention in/adherence to rehabilitation activities. This will be done by 
[CONTACT_17801] a questionnaire to participants asking questions about whether they are rec eiving 
rehabilitation therapy , and if so, whether they have been attending and following recommendations.  
 
Qualitative interviews will also be conducted at post-treatment and 1 -month follow -up to aid in 
intervention refinement  as well . Care partners of participants (e.g., family, friends, spouse) will be invited 
to participate in the interviews as well.

5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria / Study Population  
People with aphasia: People  with aphasia will be screened for eligibility through an in -
person meeting with a member of the research team after written consent is obtained. Screening 
will consist of  administration of a questionnaire , language assessment , and  review of medical 
records . Medical records will be reviewed to confirm left -hemisphere stroke , time post -stroke , and 
the absence of other neurological disorders (an exclusion criterion) . Medical records will be 
accessed via Epic if the participant was treated at MUSC for their stroke or requested from their 
admitting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the participant is judged to not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will 
not be allowed to continue with the remainder of the study.  
Inclusion Criteria  
• 18-81 years old  
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/24  
 Page 8 of 18  • Native English speaker (English fluency by [CONTACT_654] 7)  
• Aphasia as a result of a l eft-hemisphere ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke  (WAB -
R Aphasia Quotient < 93.8)  
• At least 1-month  post-stroke  
• Confirmation of left hemisphere stroke per medical records  
• Discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Participant is willing and able to consent for themselves.  
Exclusion Criteria  
• Uncorrected hearing or visual impairment  that prevents completion of 
experimental activities as determined by [CONTACT_6270] -report  
• History of other neurological disorder or disease beside stroke (e.g., dementia, 
traumatic brain injury)  as determined by [CONTACT_6270] -report and/or medical records  
• Self-reported history of premorbid learning disability  
• Severe auditory comprehension deficits  (as indicated by a score of more than 
two standard deviations below norms on the Auditory Verbal section of WAB -
R)  
 
Care partners : Care partners of included participants with aphasia will be invited to 
participate in the post -treatment and follow -up qualitative interviews to get their perspectives on 
the intervention and its feasibility. If the participant with aphasia does not have an involved care 
partner, then no care partner will be included in the interviews.  
Inclusion Criteria  
• 18+ years old  
• Care partner of an included participant with aphasia (e.g., close friend or family 
member that had frequent interactions with the participant during their participation 
in the study ).  
Exclusion Criteria  – None.  
 
Efforts  will be made to ensure a representative sample of the broader Charleston area in terms of 
sex/gender and race/ethnicity , however, participants will not be excluded based on sex/gender or 
race/ethnicity, thus there is potential for an imbalance.  
 Children will be excluded because stroke in children is rare and presentation  of language 
symptoms is different compared to adults due to brain plasticity and the course of language 
development.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_718802] 10 participants with aphasia complete the study.  This sample size was 
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/24  
 Page 9 of 18  chosen because this is a feasibility/pi[INVESTIGATOR_50382] 10 participants is a feasible sample that will allow us to 
gather preliminary data to aid in the development of the intervention. We will also recruit up to 10 care 
partners of participants with aphasia to participate in q ualitative interviews after the intervention to gain 
their perspectives as well. Thus, a total of up to 30 participants will be recruited.  
7.0 Setting  
Assessment and treatment sessions will be conducted on MUSC’s campus in a private 
treatment room at the College of Health Professions Building C. Screening/Baseline, Post -
Treatment, and Follow -Up sessions will be conducted in -person. Treatment sessions will also be 
conducted in person; however, if necessary, treatment sessions can be conducted on Zoom. 
Qualitative interviews with care partners can a lso be conducted via Zoom if care partners are 
unable to attend in person  and would like to partake in the qua litative interview . 
8.0 Recruitment Methods  
This study will recruit from the Registry for Stroke Recovery (RESTORE -Pro#00037803, 
IRB approved 9/6/14) which is a research tool sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] 
(NIH) Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Stroke Recovery with  subjects 
consented for future contact [CONTACT_452158].   RESTORE 
staff will query the registry for potential subjects and provide the Principal Investigator (PI) with 
the contact [CONTACT_247345].   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_549161].  
We will also recruit participants through local advertisement (flyers) in local acute 
care/inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549162] , including the MUSC CARES Medical 
Clinic . Local speech -language pathologists will be informed about the study and given flyers so 
they can inform their patients with aphasia about the study . If their patients express interest in 
participating  and give permission to the SLP to share their contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, phone 
number, and or email) to be contact[CONTACT_107801] , the SLP may send their na me and 
contact [CONTACT_502754], [CONTACT_549179] , who will then contact [CONTACT_549172] . Otherwise, interested parties can contact [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_549163]. We will also recruit participants from local stroke and 
aphasia support groups  by [CONTACT_549173]/or by

10.0 Study Design  / Methods  
 
This study is a within -subject, pre -post, repeated measures , mixed -methods design to test the 
feasibility and acceptance of a psychosocial intervention for people with post -stroke aphasia and to gather 
preliminary data on its efficacy on improving psychosocial outcomes and retention/adherence to speech 
therapy. Quantitative primary and secondary outcomes will be administered before and after the 
intervention and at 1 -month follow -up. In addition, qualitative data (questionnaire and interviews ) will be 
collected at the end of the intervention to assess feasibility, a cceptance, effects on retention/adherence to 
speech therapy, and to aid in refinement of the intervention. This includes semi -structured interviews that 
will be administered to participants with aphasia and care partners. Screening/Baseline, Post -Treatment, 
and Follow -Up sessions will be conducted in -person. Treatment sessions will also be conducted in person; 
however, if needed for personal circumstances, treatment sessions can be conducted on Zoom. Qualitative 
interviews with care partners can also be con ducted via Zoom if care partners are unable to attend in 
person. A full description of all sessions is provided below  and a summary of sessions are provided in 
Table 2 below . In general, if participants get fatigued or emotion at any point during testing  or the 
intervention , breaks will be provided and emotional suppor t will be provided by [CONTACT_2710] , if 
appropriate .  
 
Screening/Baseline Visit : This session will last approximately [ADDRESS_718805] of obtaining consent 
for the study, testing for inclusion/exclusion criteria, gathering personal history, and getting to know the 
participant/establishing rapport. If, based on the completed screening ta sks, participants are appropriate 
for the study, they will be evaluated for psychosocial functioning, communication confidence, and 
cognition.  
The following measures will be administered in the first session:  
• Screening assessments  
o Questionnaire (demographic variables, personal/medical history, speech therapy 
history, psychological history)  
o Western Aphasia Battery -Revised (WAB -R; Kertesz, 2007)  
o Request medical records  
• Psychosocial assessments  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983)  
o Dynamic Visual Analog Mood Scale (D -VAMS; 
http://dvams.com/dvams/menu_home_dvams.htm ; Barrows, 2013)  
o Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire -10 (SADQ -10; Sutcliffe & Lincoln, 
1998)  
o Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety Scale (Kneebone et al., 2012; Linley -Adams et 
al., 2014)  
o Simple Aphasia Stress Scale (SASS; Laures -Gore & Rice, 2019)  
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/24  
 Page 11 of 18  o Modified Perceived Stress Scale (mPSS; Hunting Pompon et al., 2018)  
o Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life (SAQOL -39; Hilari et al., 2003)  
• Communication Confidence Rating Scale for Aphasia (CCRSA; Cherney et al., 2011; 
Babbitt et al., 2011)  
• Cognitive Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (Barnay et al., 2012, 2014)  
 
All assessment data will be collected via a secure data capture platform  or on paper. The D -VAMS 
is an online -based assessment tool and data from that assessment will be exported to an .xml file 
and saved on the MUSC Network a cloud -based storage account to which only research personnel 
have access. Medical records will be reviewed to confirm the participant meets 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Given that it may take time to obtain medical records to confirm 
eligibility  (if the participant was not treated at MUSC for their stroke) , if participants meet the rest 
of the eligibility  criteria based on the questionnaire and WAB -R, then we will proceed with the 
remainder of the assessments in the Screening/Baseline session and confirm eligibility via medical 
records after the session .  
Session 1: Session 1 will be scheduled once medical records are obtained and the participant’s 
eligibility is confirmed. If possible, Session [ADDRESS_718806] about 30 minutes. This session will focus on psychoeducation and an 
introduction to behavioral activation therapy. See detailed agenda  for intervention sessions  in 
Section 3 above entitled “Intervention to be studied”.  
Sessions 2-5: Session [ADDRESS_718807] about 30 minutes. See detailed 
agenda for intervention sessions in Section 3 above entitled “Intervention to be studied”.  
Session 6 (Post -Treatment Testing):  The post -treatment testing session will last approximately [ADDRESS_718808] a semi -structured qualitative interview to gather 
information about how feasible the intervention  was for participants, their perceptions/opi[INVESTIGATOR_549164], and what they might want to see included that was not included.   
The following assessments will be administered a t the post -treatment testing session:  
• Assessments  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]  
o Dynamic Visual Analog Mood Scale  
o Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire -10  
o Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety Scale  
o Simple Aphasia Stress Scale  
o Modified Perceived Stress Scale  
o Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life  
o Communication Confidence Rating Scale for Aphasia  
• Questionnaire about retention/adherence to outpatient speech therapy  
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/24  
 Page 12 of 18  • Qualitative interview regarding perceptions of intervention  with participants with aphasia 
and their care partners  
Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Audio recordings will be made on a 
Sony digital recorder and transferred immediately after the session to an MUSC Network 
computer or a cloud -based storage account to which only research perso nnel have access. Once 
transferred, audio recordings will be deleted off the recording device.  
Weekly check -in phone calls:  For the period of time  between Session 6 (post -treatment) and 
Session 7 (1-month follow -up), w e will conduct three weekly phone calls with the participant 
and/or the care partner to discuss behavioral activation activities and problem solve any issues 
they are having with completing pleasant /scheduled  activities.  
Session 7 (1-month Follow -Up):  The following assessments will be administered a the 1 -month 
follow -up testing session:  
• Assessments  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]  
o Dynamic Visual Analog Mood Scale  
o Stroke Aphasia Depression Questionnaire -10  
o Behavioural Outcomes of Anxiety Scale  
o Simple Aphasia Stress Scale  
o Modified Perceived Stress Scale  
o Stroke Aphasia Quality of Life  
o Communication Confidence Rating Scale for Aphasia  
• Qualitative interview regarding perceptions of intervention  with participants with aphasia 
and their care partners  
Again, qualitative interviews will be audio recorded and data will be handled the same way as  for 
the post -treatment session.

Qualitative interview  
 
To compensate participants with aphasia for their time and transportation costs, they will 
be paid $40 per session. If they participate in all 8 sessions, they will earn $320. Payment for study 
visits will be made using a pre -paid debit card, called a Clin Card. Participants will be given a 
ClinCard at the beginning of the study. After each session they participate in, they will receive $[ADDRESS_718810] paired -samples t-tests to 
compare each outcome measure with 2 time points: baseline  vs. post-treatment and baseline vs. 1-
month follow -up. Baseline vs. post -treatment comparisons will be used to examine preliminary 
effects of the intervention on our primary outcome measures (HADS depression scores, HADS 
anxiety scores), and the secondary outcome measures listed above. Baseline vs. 1 -month fol low-
up comparisons will be used to examine any delayed or maintained treatment effects on the 
primary and secondary outcome measures. Quantitative feasibility data and psychosocial data will 
also be examined descriptively given the small sample size.  
Data gathered from the retention/adherence to speech therapy questionnaire and the semi -
structured interview will also be analyzed descriptively and qualitatively for emergent themes that 
can be used to further refine and develop the psychosocial intervention.  
To maintain participant confidentiality, a ll participants will be given a participant study ID  
which will be used on all their study documents  and data . Participant names and direct identifiers  
will be stored separately  from collected data and participant names and study IDs will be linked in 
one password -protected document saved on an MUSC Network computer or cloud -based storage 
account . Data will be stored in a secure data capture platform , on an MUSC Network computer or 
cloud -based storage account, and/or on paper in a  locked file cabinet in a locked room on campus 
to which only research personnel have access . Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed 
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/[ADDRESS_718811] access.  
The RESTORE registry (Pro#00037803), from which this study will recruit subjects, also serves 
as a data analysis tool by [CONTACT_549176]’s stroke recovery research community with a more complete  registry with key stroke elements. 
Some subjects may have participated or will participate in other stroke related research studies at MUSC. 
Sharing data from this and other stroke research studies with RESTORE will allow for more targeted 
recruitment eff orts in the future and could reduce the burden placed on subjects by [CONTACT_549177]. The thi rd Aim of this study leverages this 
ability, as other studies will be better able to target their recruitment based on the information collected in 
these assessments.  Subjects are informed in the consent process if they enroll into the RESTORE registry, 
their data from this study will be shared. They are given the option to do so or not in the consent form. 
Subjects will be asked to sign a HIPAA authorization stating their health information may be disclosed to 
MUSC investigators requiring their data for their research projects upon approval by [CONTACT_84786].   
 
15.0 Risks to Subjects  
 There is minimal risk to participants in this study. Participants with aphasia may 
experience occasional frustration  during administration of the assessments if they are not 
performing as well as they like . If this occurs, breaks and emotional support will be provided by 
[CONTACT_5051]. In addition, due to the emotional nature of some assessments and of the 
psychosocial intervention, participants may experience some negative emotions /psychological 
discomfort  during discussions about adapting to life after a stroke. If this occurs, emotional 
support will be provided by [CONTACT_5051] s and participants will be given a break, if needed. If 
participants demonstrate or reveal any concerns that would require more urgent mental health 
support, such as expressing thoughts of suicide, violence, or substance abuse, they will be referred 
to a mental health expert immediately. We have included a list of mental health referrals in the 
application in the General Comments 2.[ADDRESS_718812]. Lisa McTeague, then the participant will be 
taken to the Emergency Room or 911 will be called. In addition, if participants would benefit from 
ongoing mental health support/counseling after completion of the study then they will be given the 
list of mental health providers to choose from . Finally, though efforts will be made t o maintain 
confidentiality, there is a small risk of a confidentiality breach  of participant data (for participants 
with aphasia and care partner interview data) . Participants will be warned of these risks during the 
consent process prior to their agreeing to partake in the research study.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
 Participants with aphasia may benefit from the psychological intervention in terms of their 
psychological well-being, however, this is not guaranteed  as this is an experimental intervention . 
Although it may or may not benefit participants directly, the information we gather from this study 
could help us better address the psychological need of people with aphasia in the future as well. 
Care partners of participants with aphasia will not directly benefit from their participation in the 
Version #  3; Version Date  12/17/[ADDRESS_718813] symptom s of 
depression, anxiety, or other psychosocial needs.

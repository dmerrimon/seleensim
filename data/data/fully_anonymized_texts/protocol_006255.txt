1 STUDY RATIONALE/BACKGROUND  
Administration  of concomitant  antibiotics  (CA)  is a known risk factor  for treatment  failure  in 
the treatment  of CDI,  as well as for recurrence  of CDI.  Recent  data suggested  that among  
patients  receiving  CA, fidaxomicin  200 mg twice  daily  is superior  to oral vancomycin  125 
mg four times  daily  with clinical  cure rates of 90.0%  and 79.4%,  respectiv ely (p= 0.04)1. 
While  these  data are encouraging,  many  clinicians  remain  unclear  on how  to apply  these  
data to patient  care as a conservative  definition  for CA was  used in this trial (any patient  
who received  ≥ [ADDRESS_382450] CA.) Additionally,  patients  were  
excluded  from  the trial if it was expected  that they would  require  ≥ [ADDRESS_382451]  spectrum  CA for the treatment  of concomitant  
systemic  infections.

3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND  ENDPOINTS  
3.1 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
3.1.1 PRIMARY  OBJECTIVES:  
To compare  the clinical  cure rate using  fidaxomicin  compared  to oral vancomycin  for 
the treatment  of CDI in patien ts requiring  CA.  
3.1.2 SECONDARY  OBJECTIVES:  
To compare  the impact  of therapy  (fidaxomicin  versus  vancomycin)  on recurrence,  
length  of stay, ICU length  of stay (when  applicable),  time to resolution  of diarrhea*,  
rates of colectomy,  and 30 day  mortality  (both  attributable  and all cause)  in patients  
with CDI requiring  CA for concomitant  systemic  infections . 
 
* Two definitions  of time to resolution  of diarrhea  will be analyzed.  The first, which  
will be a component  of clinical  cure,  is consistent  with published  CDI literature  and 
will be defined  as ≤ [ADDRESS_382453]  isolation . 
 
3.2 STUDY  ENDPOINTS  
3.2.1 PRIMARY  ENDPOINT:  
Clinical  cure 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PRIMARY  ENDPOINT  DEFINITION:  
Resolution  of diarrhea  (≤[ADDRESS_382454] ). Clinical  failure  will be 
defined  as persistent  diarrhea  and/or  the need for additional  treatment  for 
CDI at the end of study  therapy.  
 
3.2.2 SECONDARY  ENDPOINT(S):  
Recurrence,  length of stay ( LOS), ICU LOS, time to resolution  of diarrhea  (total),  
rates of colectomy  due to CDI,  30 day mortality,  and 30 day  readmission . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SECONDARY  ENDPOINT  DEFINITION(S):  
Recurrence :  defined  as all three  of the following  within  4 weeks  after 
successfully  completing  study  treatment:  reappearance  of symptoms  of CDI 
(>3 unformed  stools  in a 24 hour  period), a positive  stool  test for C. difficile  
(Figure 1 ), and the need for retreatment  with an agent  active  against  C. 
difficile . 
 
Length  of Stay:   defined  as the length  of stay from  the time of study  
enrollment  until discharge  from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
 
ICU length  of stay:  pertinent  to patients  in the ICU at the time of study  
This [COMPANY_006]  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Template  is Proprieta ry and Shall  not be  Reproduced  
Effective  Date 13Aug2014  3 /10  
 enrollment and patients  admitted  to the ICU within  48 hours  after study  
enrollment/ C. difficile  onset.  Defined  as the length  of stay from  enrollment  in 
the study  until discharge  from  the ICU. 
 
• Time  from  study  enrollment  to resolution  of diarrhea  (as 
defined  earlier in 3.1.2)  
• Rates  of colectomy  due to  CDI 
• 30 day  mortality,  both overall  and attributable  
 
Subgroup  analysis:   A subgroup  analysis  will be performed  analyzi ng the above  
outcomes  in patients  with severe  disease  (defined  as Scr ≥ 1.5 mg/dL  or WBC 
≥ 15,000  cells/mm3)  and also for those  with mild-moderate  disease .

4.2 INCLUSION/EXCLUSION  CRITERIA  
4.2.1 INCLUSION  CRITERI A 
▪ Patients 18 years of age or older  with >3 unformed stools/[ADDRESS_382456] for C. difficile . 
 
▪ Patients  receiving  ≥ 1 high or medium  risk antibiotic  for treatment  of an 
infection  other  than CDI,  for an  anticipated  duration  of ≥ 5 days from the 
time of enrollment  
• High  risk: carbapenems, 2nd-4th generation  cephalosporins,  
fluoroquinolones,  clindamycin,  and beta-lactam/beta -lactamase  
inhibitor  combinations   
• Medium  risk: 1st generation  cephalosporin,  macrolides *, and 
aztreonam  
o *The macrolide w ould be considered to be low risk   if 
patients are receiving intermittent macrolides for 
prophylaxis only and not for treatment of an acute 
infection  
 
4.2.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
• Patients  with severe -complicated  disease  that would  compromise  oral 
therapy  (hypotensi on or shock, ileus or bowel obstruction, megacolon ) 
 
• Patients  with an allergy  to oral  vancomycin  or fidaxomicin  
 
This [COMPANY_006]  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Template  is Proprieta ry and Shall  not be  Reproduced  
Effective  Date 13Aug2014  4 /10  
 • Patients  anticipated  to receive metronidazole  after enrollment  
 
• Patients  who already  received  oral vancomycin  or metronidazole  (either  oral 
or intravenous)  for > 24 hours  within  the preceding  72 hours  at the time of 
enrollment  
 
• Patients  anticipated  to receive  adjunctive  C. difficile  therapy  (rifaxamin,  
nitazoxanide,  tigecycline)  after enrollment  
 
• Patients who are on laxatives  before they are enro lled into the study , such as 
lactulose, if:

baseline.  
• Patients who have had colo stomy or ileostomy  
• Patients who will have colostomy or ileostomy after enrollment and before 
study ends  
• Patients who are or will be on long -term (>12 weeks) medium or high -risk 
antibiotics prophylaxis after enrollment  
 
4.3 SAMPLE  SIZE  
4.3.1 NUMBER  OF CHARTS  TO BE REVIEWED  
Not applicable  
 
4.3.2 NUMBER  OF SUBJECTS  TO BE ENROLLED  
1500 patients  will be expected  over the study  period  (2.5 years)  at the sites.  During  
study  assessment  it was determined  that ~ 41% of all patients  at the sites would  be 
eligible  for the study  (having CDI while  on a high or medium  risk CA for an 
expected  duration  of ≥ 5 days,  and having  not received  24 hours  of pre-treatment  of 
vancomycin  or metronidazole)  leaving  615 eligible  patients  over the study  period.  
Given  the open  label  nature  of this study  we anticipate  being  able to enroll  200 of 
these  eligible  patients,  100 to each treatment  arm, based on the low drop -out rate  
(<2%) that we have seen thus far .  This would  allow us to have approximately  [ADDRESS_382457]  and colleagues  because  more  patients  who are 
receiving  long course  of CA will  fail to reach  clinical  cure on vancomycin.  
Therefore , our power  calculations  are based  off an expected  90% cure rate with 
fidaxomicin  and 75% with vancomycin , and a total sample number of [ADDRESS_382458] 80% power,  with an alpha  of 0.05,  100 patients  will need  to be randomized  
into each arm (total  n = 200).

Effective  Date 13Aug2014  5 /[ADDRESS_382459] of care C. difficile  testing platform  and 
assessed for eligibility using the Stool Testing Algorithm for C. difficile  (Figure 1) . 
Study  personnel  will receive  all positive  results  in real time and will then screen  
the patient  for inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  Screening  will occur  7 days a 
week.  If a patient  meets  inclusion  criteria  the study  staff will approach  the primary  
team  and with t heir approval  the patient  for enrollment.  
4.4.2 RANDOMIZATION  
Patients  will be stratified  for randomization  based  on two criteria:  severity  of CDI,  
and CDI epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  (stratified  into first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]/first recurrence  or > 1 recurrence) . 
 
Once  a patient  is enrolled  in the study,  study staff  will randomize  patients  utiliz ing 
a randomization  binder  stored electronically by [CONTACT_310930] . The patient  
will be placed  in an open  label  treatment  arm as described  below.

* Laboratory  values  will be recorded  as ordered  and evaluated  by [CONTACT_310932].  The standard of care lab resu lts that 
will be collected from subject  medical record s as a part of the study are your 
white blood cell count, platelets, ALT, AS T, total bilirubin, albumin, 
prothrombin time, serum creatinine, lactic acid, and carbon dioxide.  No 
laboratory  values  will be ordered  by [CONTACT_310933].  If 
the patient  has left the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310929] (EOT)  or Test of  Cure 
(TOC ), they will be instructed  to monitor  their symptoms  daily  and keep note of 
fevers  and number  of bowel  movements.  Follow  up phone  calls to assess  cure and 
recurrence  will be made  at the EOT and TOC dates  when  necessary.   
 
5.3 ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING  
5.3.1 DEFINITIONS  
A mild adverse  event is one that is noticeable to the investigator,  physicians  
caring  for the patient  and/or  the patient,  however  does not interfere  with routine  
clinical  care and requires  no specific  intervention.  An example  of this would  be 
mild nausea  from  study  medication.  
A moderate  adverse  event  interferes  with routine  clinical  care,  however  responds  
to symptomatic  management.  An example  would  be vomiting  that responds  to 
anti-emetic  therapy.  
A severe  adverse  event is one that limits  the subject’s  ability  to perform  
routine  activities  and does not respond  to symptomatic  treatment.  An adverse  
event  would  also be considered  severe  if it worsens  clinical  prognosis,  
requires  escalation  in level  of care (i.e. ICU admission),  or negatively  impact s 
outcome  variables.  An example  of this   would be  anaphylactic  shock  
secondary  to the  study  medications.  
5.3.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY MEDICATION  
The following  criteria  will be used to determine  relatedness  to the study  medication:  
 
Not Related:  an AE with a temp oral relationship to the drug  administered  that 
makes  a causal  relationship  improbable,  and/or  for which  other  drugs  or 
underlying  or concurrent  disease provide  a plausible explanation . 
Unlikely  Related:  an AE that has a plausible temporal relationship  to the drug  
This [COMPANY_006]  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. Template  is Proprieta ry and Shall  not be  Reproduced  
Effective  Date 13Aug2014  7 /10  
 administered,  but for  which other causative factor(s) more likely  account  for the  
event  and where  dechallenge  (withdrawal  of drug  treatment)  or dose reduction  
was not felt clinically  indicated  or improvements  on dechallenge or dose 
reduction  have not been  observed . 
Possibly  Related : an AE that has a plausible temporal relationship  to the drug  
administered,  but for  which other  causative  factor(s) could  account  for the event  
and where improvements  on dechallenge or dose reduction  may or may not have 
been observed.

5.3.4 RECORDING  AND  REPO RTING A SAE  
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDIES  NOT  PERFORMED  UNDER  AN IND 
Adverse  Events  (AEs)  will be recorded  on the case report  form  in REDCap . 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and non -serious AEs will be reported  to the 
performance site  IRBs in accordance with local  guidelines.  SAEs  meeting the 
NIH definition of Unanticipate d Problem  will be reported to the FDA.  
Coordinating center staff  will also work  with Cubist/[COMPANY_006]  as necessary  to 
address  any AE's related  to study  product.

6 DATA COLLECTION  AND  ANALYSIS  
6.1 DATA  COLLECTION  
Data collection  will be completed  by [CONTACT_310934]  a standardized  data 
collection  form  provided by [CONTACT_310935] R EDCap with all 
relevant  patient -specific  and treatment -related  information.  
6.2 DATA  VALIDATION  
 Members  of each performance site’s  study  team  who do not participate in data entry  
will validate  clinical  outcomes,  as reported  in the data collection  form,  in 10% of 
patient  cases.  If significant  discrepancies  are found  in ≥ 10% of the analyzed  cases,  
then full validation  will occur  for all patient  cases.  
 
6.3 DATA / STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All statistical  analyses  will be performed  by [CONTACT_310936]  
9.3. For objective  1, the clinical  cure rates of the two treatment  arms  will be compared  
using  Fisher’s  exact  test. Other  analyses relevant  to objective  [ADDRESS_382465]. Multivariate  models  will be 
constructed  using  logistic  regressions  to ident ify individual  factors  associated  with 
either  cure or failure.  Variables  associated  with cure or failure  in the bivariate  analyses  
with p values  < 0.10 will be put into the multivariate  models.  Treatment  arm will be 
forced  into the model  as appropriate  and other  variables  that the investigators  deem

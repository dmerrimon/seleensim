TITLE OF STUDY: 
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open-Label Dose -Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU 
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL-003 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 8 centers in the [LOCATION_002] 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2 
STUDY RATIONALE: The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve 
lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve central nervous system developmental and functional outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL-PEG) is a 
potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals 
with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe con centrations, which may have additional clinical 
benefits. This study is an extension of the do se-finding study (Study PAL-002). Administration of 
rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whether long-term dosing of rAvPAL-PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects.  
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long-term administra tion of SC injections of rAvPAL-PEG on blood 
Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. 
• To evaluate the immune response to long-term administration of SC injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU who participated in Study PAL-002. 
• To evaluate steady-state PK of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. 
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2, op en-label, dose-finding study (Study PAL-002) in - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223337]: rAvPAL-PEG

approximately 35 subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested in 
PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 
PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in PAL-002 will be enrolled into this study. Diet will not 
be altered during the course of this study, except as necessary for safety. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations throughout the study. Toxicity 
will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. 
A Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the study. 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 participants ’ rAvPAL-PEG dosing will continue in PAL-[ADDRESS_223338]’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or 
maintain blood Phe concentrations below 480 µmol/L. Subjects will continue to receive injections in 
the clinic, administered by [CONTACT_96937], but may later be allowed to self-administer doses of study drug 
at home. Whether a subject may be allowed to self-administer study drug doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
The dose may be modified at any time for safety. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected timepoints as shown in 
Table 2.1.[ADDRESS_223339]’s blood Phe concentration has been controlled to 
within a target range (below 480 µ mol/L), the subject may be asked to have additional blood draws for 
PK and blood Phe concentration analyses. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3. The drug becomes commercially available following the appropriate marketing approval. 
4. The study is terminated. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223340]: rAvPAL-PEG

Dose Adjustment Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator, in agreement with the 
Study Medical Officer. Depending upon the response to rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-002, a subject’s dose 
may be adjusted beginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the subject’s 
current dose. 
• The dose may be decreased as appropriate to achieve or maintain a favorable blood Phe concentration. 
• When adjusting the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose cohort levels that were defined in the previous study (PAL- 002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189439], up to one dose per day, for a maximum total dose per week of 2 mg/kg. 
• When a dose is adjusted (either by [CONTACT_189440]), the subject must remain in the clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223341] be a minimum of 2 weeks after each dose adjustment before any additional dose adjustments may be made, 
so that blood Phe concentrations can be assessed. 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]
: 
If an individual subject exhibits drug-related toxicity of CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_223342]’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_9532] (PI) and the Study Medical Officer, and a decision will then be made whether to 
discontinue the subject from the study, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level. 
In addition, if 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit drug-related toxicity of CTCAE grade 3 or 
greater, further dosing of subjects at that dose level and any higher dose levels will be halted until a 
safety assessment is completed.

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: 
Efficacy: 
Blood Phe concentrations will be measured. 
Safety: 
Safety will be evaluated on the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and clinically significant changes in 
vital signs or laboratory test results. 
Pharmacokinetic: 
Plasma concentrations of rAvPAL-PEG will be measured when steady-state levels of Phe are attained.  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size : 
Subjects who participated in PAL-002 may be enrolled into this study. No formal sample size 
calculation was conducted. 
Safety Analysis : 
All subjects who receive any amount of study drug in this study will be included in the safety analyses. Safety will be evaluated on the incidence of AEs, including serious AEs (SAEs), and clinically 
significant changes in vital signs and laboratory test results. 
Efficacy Analysis : 
Data from all subjects who receive any amount of st udy drug and who have any posttreatment efficacy 
data will be included in the efficacy analysis. 
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled timepoint will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration from baseline to each scheduled timepoint will also be summarized. 
Pharmacokinetic Analysis : 
Data from all subjects who complete at least 2 weeks of the study will be included in the PK analysis. Steady-state PK (predose samples) of rAvPAL-PEG will be evaluated in PKU subjects after the 
subject has achieved and maintained target blood Phe concentration (below 480 µmol/L) for a 
minimum of 2 weeks (to allow assessment of blood Phe concentrations) and no further dose 
modification is planned. Once this target has been achieved, PK samples will be collected predose on - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223348]: rAvPAL-PEG

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of phe nylalanine ammonia lyase ( rA vPAL-PEG) is contained in 
the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator should review this document prior to initiating 
this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The murine model of phenylketonuria (PKU) BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2), a mouse line that is 
deficient in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity (Shedlovsky, 1993, Genetics) , was 
used for in vivo screening and pharmacody namic studies. This mouse model exhibits 
characteristics similar to those seen in PKU patients, including hyperphenylalaninemia 
(baseline plasma phenylalanine [Phe] concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µM) and 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Weekly subcutaneous (SC) administration of 80 mg/kg of rAvPAL-PEG 
(approximately 4 IU/mouse) for greater than 3 months lowered blood Phe concentration from 
approximately 2000 µM to less than 200 µM. A similar profile of Phe reduction was also 
seen in ENU2 mice administered wild-type AvPAL-PEG (4 IU/mouse) over [ADDRESS_223367]. In addition to the reduction of plasma 
Phe, a dose-related darkening in coat color occurred, indicating the biosynthesis of melanin, which was previously inhibited when plasma Phe could not be metabo lized and plasma Phe 
concentrations were high. When administrati on of AvPAL-PEG was stopped for 2 to 7 weeks 
and then reinitiated with weekly administra tions, no attenuated res ponse was observed and 
Phe concentrations remained low throughout the week. 
The safety of rAvPAL-PEG was evaluated in  safety pharmacology studies (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
central nervous system [CNS] and cardiovascular [CV]) and toxicity with toxicokinetic 
studies (single and 28-day repeated dose) in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Overall, in all toxicity studies no immune-related toxicities were seen either systemically or at the injection site. No specific methoxypolyethylene glycol  (PEG)-related histol ogical findings were 
observed during the 28-day repeated dose studies. 
Findings in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with a single administration of 
60 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG included morbidity, decreased plasma Phe concentration, decreased protein synthesis, and gastrointestinal (GI) lesions. Plasma Phe concentrations were also reduced to below the level of detection in  the lower dose groups, but without similar - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223368] played a part in 
these morbidity results, although plasma Phe conc entrations were low in all treated monkeys. 
The main finding in the 28-day study was the possible drug-related observation of minimal to 
slight degeneration of blood vesse ls of predominantly medium-siz ed muscular arteries with a 
non-dose-dependent involvement of different orga ns observed in 1 male in the 0.1 mg/kg and 
1 male and 1 female in the 1.0 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG dose groups. 
The half-life of rAvPAL-PEG administered to normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 
250 mg/kg, was 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_223369] area under the 
plasma concentration-time curv e (AUC)-dose linearity. In the cynomolgus monkey after SC 
administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the half-life was 65 hours at 4 mg/kg, 71 hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have similar characteristics. The following findings were noted: (1) a 1-compartment mode l with first-order absorption appears to 
describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL-PEG after single-dose administration, (2) absorption 
is slow and there is a long absorption peri od after SC administration to maximum plasma 
concentration, along with a long half-life, (3 ) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there 
does not appear to be a gender differen ce, and (5) AUC and the maximum plasma 
concentration (C
max) are roughly linearly proportional. 
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
This study is an extension of the second hum an clinical study with rAvPAL-PEG (Study 
PAL-002). Study PAL-001, the first-in-human clinical study of rAvPAL–PEG, was designed 
as a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, dose- escalation study in approximately 35 subjects, 
16 to 50 years old, with PKU. The doses for this study  are planned to be in the same range as 
those tested in PAL-001 and PAL-002 (0.001 th rough 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no 
dose-limiting toxicity was observed in those studies. 
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited disease characterized by [CONTACT_189448] (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw-Hill) . Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North 
America is born with PKU (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw-Hill). Left untreated, PAH deficiency is associated with an abnormally elevated concentra tion of Phe, which is toxic to 
the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr.)  and can result in a variety of neuropathologic 
conditions, including mental retardation, mi crocephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and 
behavioral abnormalitie s (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw-Hill). Th e brains of untreated patients - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223370] in cerebral development, 
and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated 
Phe during fetal development leads to severe mental retardation and can cause microcephaly, growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, Pediatrics), (Koch, 2003, Pediatrics), (Lee, 2003, Pediatrics), (Levy, 2003,  Pediatrics), (Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics), 
(Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr.) . 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan
® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of  PKU involves adherence to low-Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary re striction of Phe-containing  foods. Implementation of a 
Phe-restricted diet in infancy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents 
many of the neuropathologic ma nifestations of PKU, including  severe mental retardation. 
However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of 
natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet) . 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable contro l of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve 
central nervous system developmental and functional outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia 
lyase (rAvPAL-PEG) is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe 
concentrations, which may have additional clinical benefits. This study is an extension of the dose-finding study (PAL-002). Administration of  rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess 
whether long-term dosing of rAvPAL-PEG is  safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe 
concentrations in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from PAL-001 and PAL-002 will change the assumption that 
rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile simila r to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, 
exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that  could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include 
injection-site reactions a nd other general symptoms. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223371] been a few 
reports of PEG-related AEs in humans; cumu lative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, ol iguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG 
exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL-PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely used medicines and other compounds that are admi nistered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189286] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG-related toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was obser ved in monkeys given up to 60 mg/kg of SC rAvPAL-PEG. 
In this study, subjects will be monitore d closely with urine examinations and blood 
chemistries to follow kidney function. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_223372] the foreign protein PAL in rAvPAL-PEG has been mitigated by [CONTACT_189449]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the immune re sponse may be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] 
(Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab) . In vivo and in vitro expe riments have shown that 
PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the immunological response (Scott, 1997, 
Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs.). PEGylation has been effective in reducing anti-rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model, although PEGylation does not 
eliminate antibody formation. Although PEGylati on of rAvPAL may have a significant effect 
on reducing the immunogenicity of the molecule , it is reasonable to expect that some 
individuals may exhibit immune responses  upon exposure to the drug. These immune 
responses may be clinically irrelevant, cause symptoms of various degrees, or lead to 
neutralization of biological activity. Subjects par ticipating in clinical trials will be monitored 
closely with specific antibody titers, sedimentation rates, and complete  blood counts (CBCs). 
PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.)  (Harris, 2003, 
Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.) , and antibodies against PEG seem  to form only under special 
circumstances (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug.Discov.) (Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.)  and may be of no clinical relevance in humans (Richter, 1984, 
Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . In some individuals, anti-PEG antibodies may be 
pre-existing due to previous exposure to PE G in other products. Anti-PEG antibodies have 
been associated with nonresponsiveness against therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer),  
(Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.) . - protocol.pdf Page 26

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 Allergic reactions to the SC injection of rAvPAL-PEG may be mild, moderate, or severe in 
intensity. Reactions may include pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or 
anaphylaxis. Clinical assessments should be  conducted for a minimum of 2 hours after 
injection. Longer observations may be required at the discretion of the PI. The responsible 
physician should use all appropria te measures for the treatment of allergic reactions. Because 
of the small potential for anaphylaxis, equipm ent for emergency resuscitation (including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be within easy access dur ing and after the rAvPAL-PEG injection. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Allergic Reactions 
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of allergic symptoms: 
• Clearing the airway. 
• Vital sign check. 
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment. 
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center. 
In addition, clinical judgment must be us ed in determining th e appropriateness of 
corticosteroid administration. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (5-10 mg/kg) may also be 
administered. An allergy and/or immunology consultation should be sought if necessary. 
7.4.3 Effects of Low Blood Phe 
Insufficient Phe intake or excessive rAvPAL-PEG exposure may cause blood Phe 
concentrations to be too low (eg,  < 30 µmol/L). Prolonged low blood Phe concentrations can 
result in a catabolic state associated with poor  growth and altered body functions, including 
mental and physical alterations, loss of appetite, anemia, rashes, and diarrhea. To ensure 
safety during this study, subjects will be  monitored closely with frequent blood Phe 
concentration determinations. - protocol.pdf Page 27

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2,  open-label, dose-finding study (PAL-002) in 
approximately 35 subjects with P KU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those 
tested in PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg /kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting 
toxicity was observed in PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in PAL-002 will be en rolled into this study. Diet 
will not be altered during the course of this study, except as necessary for safety. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for bl ood Phe concentrations throughout the study. 
Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. 
A Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the study. PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 participants’ rAvPAL -PEG dosing will continue in PAL-[ADDRESS_223373]’s dose will be adjusted as 
needed to attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations below 480 µmol/L based upon 
recommendations by [CONTACT_189450] (Burgard, 1999, 
Eur J Pediatr) . Subjects will continue to receive injec tions in the clinic, administered by 
[CONTACT_96937], but may later be allowed to self-administer doses of study drug at home. Whether a subject may be allowed to self-administer study drug doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. All of the following cr iteria must be met before a subject may 
self-administer doses of the study drug: 
• The subject is willing and able to administer the study drug as directed. 
• The sponsor agrees that self-administration is  appropriate. 
• The subject has achieved a favorable dose (ie, the dosage that provides control of 
blood Phe concentrations within the targ et range for a minimum of 2 weeks). 
• The subject has received appropriate training, including administering doses under 
supervision, until the subject and clinic staff both agree such training is no longer necessary. 
The dose may be modified at any time for safety. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be  conducted at selected timepoints as shown 
in Table 2.1.[ADDRESS_223374] ’s blood Phe concentration has been - protocol.pdf Page 29

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 controlled to within a target range (below 480 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have 
additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent a nd discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3. The drug becomes commercially available following the appropriate marketing 
approval. 
4. The study is terminated. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_223375]’s dose may be modified based on th e decision of the Investigator, in agreement 
with the Study Medical Officer. Depending upon the response to rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-002, 
a subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. 
• The dose may be decreased as appropriate to achieve or maintain a favorable blood 
Phe concentration. 
• When adjusting the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose cohort levels 
that were defined in the previous study (PAL-002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189439], up to 
one dose per day, for a maximum total dose of 2 mg/kg/week. 
• When a dose is adjusted (either by [CONTACT_189440]), the subject must remain in the clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223376]’s data will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_189451] (PI) and the Study Medical Officer, and a decision - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223377] meet all of the following criteria:

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Adverse Events 
According to the ICH definition, an AE (or adverse experience) is “any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and that does not necessarily have a cau sal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and uninten ded sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the IP.” 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is describe d by [CONTACT_189458] “all noxious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose.” This means that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
An AE may include intercurrent illnesses or injuries that represent an exacerbation (increase 
in frequency, severity, or specificity) of pre-ex isting conditions (eg, worsening of asthma). 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. 
The reporting period for non-serious AEs is the period from the first administration of study 
drug through the final F/U Visit or at the ETV . If a non-serious AE remains unresolved at the 
conclusion of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_189292] a joint clinical assessment as 
to whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted, and the results of this assessment must be documented. Resolution is defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
The Investigator will assess AEs for severity, for relationship to IP, and as to whether the 
event meets one or more of the definitions of an SAE (refer to Section 10.2 ). 
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE and will record it on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Grade Description 
Mild No limitation of usual activities 
Moderate Some limitation of usual activities 
Severe Inability to carry out usual activities - protocol.pdf Page 41

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarc tion); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on s ubject/event outcome or action cr iteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not  severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the 
source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship Description 
Not Related Exposure to the IP has not occurred 
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than 
the use of the IP; that is, there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP. 
Possibly Related The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time 
AND 
The AE could be explained equall y well by [CONTACT_189459]. 
Probably 
Related The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND 
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189460]. 
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferre d terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189461], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities terminology). - protocol.pdf Page 42

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 10.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is defined as any AE that: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life threatening, that is, places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This definition does not incl ude a reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189293]-patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Admission of a subject to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189294]-patient as a result of an 
AE, even if the subject is released on the same day, qualifies as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. An event qualifies as 
resulting in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity if it involves a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out usual life functions. This 
definition is not intended to include expe riences of relatively minor or temporary 
medical significance. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is, an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a subject exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event that does not  meet any of the above criteria, but may 
jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in the 
emergency room, allergic bronchospasm, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or  development of drug de pendency or drug abuse. 
More than one of the above criteria may apply to any specific event. 
The reporting period for SAEs begins earlier than non-serious AEs and is the period from the 
time of signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_223391] be followed by 
[CONTACT_135349], even if this extends beyond the study-reporting period. Resolution of an SAE is defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
Any SAE, whether or not considered related to study drug, will be reported immediately 
(within 24 hours) to BioMarin Pharmacovi gilance by [CONTACT_189462]-specific 
SAE Report Form. In addition to the outcome  of the SAE, any medication or other 
therapeutic measures used to treat the event will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page(s). Investigators should not wait to collect additiona l information that fully documents the event 
before notifying BioMarin Pharmacovigilance of an SAE. BioMarin may be required to - protocol.pdf Page 43
 PAL-003 Page 43 of 62 
 
Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about 
the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit additional information requested by [CONTACT_189463]. 
Reporting of SAEs to the IR B will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate 
documentation must be obtained by [CONTACT_189464].

BioMarin Pharmacovigilance by [CONTACT_189465]. In addition, pregnancy in a subject is also reported on the End of Study CRF. The Investigator must make every effort to follow the subject through resolution of the pregnancy 
(delivery or termination) and to report the resolution on the Pregnancy Follow-up Form in the study reference materials. In the event of pr egnancy in the partner of a study subject, the 
Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected health information.

Proprietary and Confidential October 8, 2008 15 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC) 
The DMC will act in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor subject safety and the 
efficacy of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects who partic ipate in the study. Meetings of the DMC can 
be convened at any time at the discretion of the DMC Chair or the Study Medical Officer. The Chair will be notified by [CONTACT_189469]. The DMC will review the study data as soon as it 
is available during the study and offer advice  on whether or not to close the study on the 
basis of toxicity. Details regarding the DMC membership and safety data to be reviewed by [CONTACT_189470] a charter. 
The responsibilities of the DMC are to: 
• Review the study protocol, informed cons ent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, subjects’ risk versus benefit, and other factors that 
could affect the study outcome. 
• Consider relevant information that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participan ts in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189296]. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223406]’s disease, that are not part of this study. Costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be  billed and collected in the way that such 
costs are usually billed and collected. 
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189471] a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_189472]. Any subject who 
experiences a study-related injury should be inst ructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre-specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subject should be give n the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance with , treatment for study-related injuries. The 
treating physician should bill the subject’s hea lth insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531], if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_189474]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin 
is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]-related injuries without prior recourse to third party payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223407] be completed using a web–based application that ha s been validated. Study site 
personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source 
documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not 
acceptable. 
In the event of an entry error, or if new info rmation becomes available,  the site personnel will 
correct the value by [CONTACT_189475]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the site 
personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include 
the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and 
the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs  must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If an Investigator or institution refuses to allow access to subject re cords because of confidentiality, arrangements 
must be made to allow an “inter view” style of data verification. 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189476] “source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_189477]. 
The CRA will then review the response and dete rmine either to close the query or re–query 
the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all 
open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, a ll data fields must be  SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electroni cally sign the casebook, specifying that the 
information on the CRFs is accurate and complete . The Data Manager, or designee, will then 
set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the - protocol.pdf Page 55

The need exists for a treatment that w ill help individuals with phenylketonuria 
(PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood 
phenylalanine (Phe) 
concentrations and improve central nervous system developmental and  functional

Section 7.4.2 Toxicity 
Due to an 
Immunologic Reaction PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.)  
(Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.),  and however,  antibodies against PEG seem 
to form only under special circumstances  may form when PEG is bound to 
compounds.  (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug.Discov.) (Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.)  and may be of no  In some instances, development of such 
antibodies did not result in any significant  clinical relevance  effects  in humans 
(Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . In some individuals, anti-PEG 
antibodies may be pre-existing due to prev ious exposure to PEG in other products. 
Anti-PEG antibodies have been associated  with nonresponsiveness against therapy 
(Armstrong, 2007, Cancer) , (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.).
Two subjects enrolled in PAL-001 who ha d received one dose of rAvPAL-PEG 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions to intramuscular (IM) Depo-Provera, a 
contraceptive containing PEG 3350. Both subj ects had previously received multiple 
IM Depo-Provera injections without complications.

Because Depo-Provera contains PEG [ADDRESS_223425] ba sis for these reported events is not known, 
the use of PEG-containing injectable drugs prior to and during the study is 
prohibited as a precautionary m easure (refer to the addendum and Sections 9.3.2  
and 9.4.8 ).  
 In the event of an alle rgic reaction, subjects ma y be asked to see an

antibody testing. This additional testing may occur up to 6 months following the 
final study visit.  - protocol.pdf Page 72

TITLE OF STUDY: 
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open-Label Dose -Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability 
of Multiple  Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU 
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL-003 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 8 centers in the [LOCATION_002] 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2 
STUDY RATIONALE: 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylk etonuria (PKU) safely achieve 
lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine  (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL-PEG) is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine 
hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control 
blood Phe concentrations, which may have additional c linical benefits. This study is an extension of 
the dose-finding study (Study PAL-002). Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whether long-term dosing of rAvPAL-PEG is safe a nd can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations 
in PKU subjects.  
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long-term administra tion of SC injections of rAvPAL-PEG on blood 
Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of  long-term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. 
• To evaluate the immune re sponse to long-t erm ad ministration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU who participated in Study PAL-002. 
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PK U. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223433]: rAvPAL-PEG

STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2, open-label, dose-finding study (Study PAL-002) in 
approximately 35 
subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested in 
PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in PAL-002  will be enrolled into this study.  
 Diet will not 
be altered during the course of this study, except as necessary for safety. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations throughout the study. Toxicity 
will be measured according to the National Cancer  Institute (NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. 
A Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the study. 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 participants’ r
AvPAL-PEG dosing will continue in PAL-[ADDRESS_223434]’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or 
maintain blood Phe concentrations below 480 µ mol/L. Subjects will continue to receive injections in 
the clinic, administered by [CONTACT_96937], but may la ter be allowed to self-administer doses of study drug 
at home. Whether a subject may be allowed to sel f-administer study drug doses will be evaluated on an 
individual basis. 
The dose may be modified at any time for safety. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected timepoints as shown in 
Table 2.1.[ADDRESS_223435]’s blood Phe concentration has been controlled to 
within a target range (belo w 480 µmol/L), the subject may  be asked to have add
itional blood draws for 
PK and blood Phe concentration analyses. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws co nsent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the In vestigator. 
3. The drug becomes commercially available follo wing the appropriate marketing approval.

Dose Adjustment Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the de cision of the Investigator, in agreement with the 
Study  
Medical Officer. Depending upon the response to rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-002, a subject’s dose 
may be adjusted beginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189486] e nts of no more than 10-fold higher than the subject’s 
current dose. 
• The dose may be decreased as appropriate to ach ieve or ma intain a  favorable blood Phe 
concentration. 
• When adjusting the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose cohort levels that were 
defined in the previous study (PAL-002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189487], up to one dose 
per day, for a maxim u
m total dose per week of 2 mg/kg. 
• When a dose is adjusted (either by [CONTACT_189488]), the subject must remain in the clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223437] be a minimum of 
2 weeks after each dose adjustment befo re any additional dose adjustments may be made, 
so that blood Phe concentrations can be assessed. 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] : 
If an individual subject exhibits drug-related toxici ty of CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_223438]’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_9532] (PI) and the Study Medical Officer, and a decision will then be made whether to 
discontinue the subject from the study, restart dosi ng at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a 
lower dose level. 
In addition, if 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit drug-related toxicity of CTCAE grade 3 or 
greater, further dosing of subjects at 
that dose le vel and any higher dose leve ls will be halted until a 
safety assessment is completed.

Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of phenylalanine ammo nia lyase ( rAvPAL-PEG) is contained in 
the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator should review th is document prior to initiating 
this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The murine model of phenylketonuria (PKU) BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2), a mouse line that is 
deficient in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity (Shedlovsky, 1993, Genetics) , was 
used for in vivo screening and pharmacodyna mic studies. This m ouse model exhibits 
characteristics similar to those seen in PKU patients, including hyperphenylalaninemia 
(baseline plasma phenylalanine [Phe] concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) and 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Weekly subcutaneous (SC) ad ministration of 80 mg /kg of rAvPAL-PEG 
(approximately 4 IU/mouse) for greater than 3 months lowered blood Phe concentration from 
approximately 2000 µM to less than 200 µM. A similar profile of Phe reduction was also 
seen in ENU2 mice administered wild-type AvPAL-PE G (4 IU/mouse) over [ADDRESS_223465] udies (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
central nervous system [CNS] and cardiovascul ar [CV]) and toxicity with toxicokinetic 
studies (single and 28-day repeat ed dose) in rats and cynomolgus m
onkeys. Overall, in all 
toxicity studies no immune-related toxicities were seen either syst emically or at the injection 
site. No specific polyethylene glycol (PEG )-related histological findings were observed 
during the 28-day repeated dose studies. 
Findings in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with a single administration of 
60 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG included  reduced food consumption, dehydration, body weight 
loss, hypoactivity, hypothermia,decreased plasma Phe 
concen tration, decreased protein 
synthesis, and gastrointe stinal (GI) lesions. Plasma Phe concentrations were also reduced to 
below the level of detection in the 4 and 12 mg/kg  dose groups, but without similar - protocol.pdf Page 99
 PAL-003 Page 37 of 82 
 
Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  toxicological consequence, implying that the physiological regulation of Phe levels may 
be an important factor for influencing morbidity .  
The main finding in the 28-day study was the po ssible drug-related observation of minimal to 
slight degeneration 
of blood vessels of predomin antly medium-sized muscular arteries with a 
non-dose-dependent involvement of different orga ns observed in 1 male in the 0.1 mg/kg and 
1 male and 1 female in the 1.0 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG dose groups. No degeneration of the 
arteries was observed in animals administered 0 and 0.01 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG. 
The half-life of rAvPAL-PEG administered to normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 
250 m
g/kg, was 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_223466] area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)-dose linearity. In the cynomolgus monkey after SC 
administration of rAvPAL-PEG , the half-life was 65 hours at  4 mg/kg, 71 hours at 12 mg/kg, 
and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of 
rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and m onkey appear to have similar characteristics. The following 
findings were noted: (1) a 1-compartment mode l with first-order ab sorption appears to 
describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL-PEG after single-dose admini stration, (2) absorption 
is slow and there is a long absorption peri od after SC administration to maximum plasma 
concentration, along with a long half-life, (3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there 
does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) AUC and the maximum plasma concentration (C
max) are roughly linearly proportional. 
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
This study is an extension of the second human clinic al study with rAvPAL-PEG 
(Study PAL-002). Study PAL-001, the first-in-h uman clinical study of rAvPAL–PEG, was 
designed as a Phase 1, open-label, single-dos e, dose-escalation study in approximately 
35 subjects, 16 to 50 years old, with  PKU. The doses for this study  are planned to be in the 
same
 range as those tested in PA L-001 and PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per 
injection), provided no dose-limiting toxi city was observed in those studies. 
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited dise ase characterized by [CONTACT_189448] (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw-Hill) . Approximately 
1 in every 10,000 infants in North 
America is born with PKU (Scriver CR, 
2001, McGraw-Hill). Left untreated, PAH 
deficiency is associated with an abnormally el evated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to 
the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr.)  and can result in a variety of neuropathologic 
conditions, including mental retardation, mi crocephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and - protocol.pdf Page 100
 PAL-003 Page 38 of 82 
 
Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  behavioral abnormalities (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw-Hill ). The brains of untreated patients 
with PKU show evidence of hypomyelination an d gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, 
and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated 
Phe during fetal development leads to severe me ntal retardation and can cause microcephaly, 
growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, Pediatrics), (Koch, 2003, 
Pediatrics), (Lee, 2003, Pediatrics), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics), (Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics), 
(Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr.) . 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of  PKU involves adherence to low-Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containi ng foods. Implementation of a 
Phe-restricted diet in infanc y significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents 
many of the neuropathologic manifestations of  PKU, including severe mental retardation. 
However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, 
and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of 
natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet) . 
The need exists for a treatmen t that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely 
achieve 
lifelong, reliable contro l of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve 
functional outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia ly ase (rAvPAL-PEG) is a potential substitute 
for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme , which is defective in individuals with 
PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may contro l blood Phe concentrations, which may have additional 
clinical benefits. This study is an ex tension of the dose-finding study (PAL-002). 
Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be cont inued to assess whether long-term dosing of 
rAvPAL-PEG is safe and can maintain reduced  blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from PAL-001 and PAL-002 will change the assumption that rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile simila r to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of th ese 
drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: 
toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity  due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, 
exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be 
observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that  could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include 
injection-site reactions and other general symptoms. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223467] been a few 
reports of PEG-related AEs in humans; cumu lative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, ol iguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG 
exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG 
dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely 
used medicines and other compounds that are admi nistered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189286] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG-re lated toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys  given up to 60 mg/ kg of SC rAvPAL-PEG. 
In this study, subjects will be monitored closely with urine examinations and blood 
chemistries to follow kidney 
function. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_223468] the foreign protein PAL in rAvPAL-PEG has been mitigated by [CONTACT_189449]. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the immune  response may be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] 
(Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab) . In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that 
PEGylation of proteins and cells can  attenuate the immunological response (Scott, 1997, 
Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs.). PEGylation has been effective in reducing anti-rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model, although PEGylation does not eliminate antibody formation. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL may have a significant effect 
on reducing the immunogenicity of the molecu le, it is reasonable to expect that some 
individuals may exhibit immune responses  upon exposure to the drug. These immune 
responses may be clinically irrelevant, cause symptoms of various degrees, or lead to 
neutralization of biological activity. Subjects partic ipating in clinical trials will be monitored 
closely with specific antibody tit ers, sedimentation rates, a nd complete blood counts (CBCs). 
PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.)  (Harris, 2003, 
Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), however,  antibodies against PEG may form when PEG is bound to 
compounds . (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug.Discov.) (Richter, 
1983, Int.Arch.Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.)  In some instances, development of such  antibodies did not result in any 
significant  clinical effects  in humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . In 
some individuals, anti-PEG antibodies may be pre-existing due to previous exposure to PEG in other products. Anti-PEG antibodies have been associated with nonresponsiveness against 
therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.). - protocol.pdf Page 102

Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  Two subjects enrolled in PAL-001 who ha d received one dose of rAvPAL-PEG 
experienced hypersensitivity reactions to intramuscular (IM) Depo-Provera, a 
contraceptive containing PEG 3350. Both subjects had previously received multiple IM Depo-Provera injections without complications. 
The first subject, a  year old , developed bruising at the injection site on Day 1 
that resolved on Day 15.  developed hives and mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_60319] 10 minutes

 was treated in the emergency room with , and 
; and oral . The events resolved the same day, and the 
subject had no further complications. The subject had no prior history of any reactions to Depo-Provera. Subsequently, while under the care of an allergist/immunologist, 
the subject had a mild reaction to a concen trated intradermal (1:10) exposure of 
Depo-Provera.  was later given a full dose of IM Depo-Provera without problems. 
The second subject, an  year old , had a slightly raised, erythematic rash below 
the site of rAvPAL-PEG injection on Day 11 that resolved withou t treatment 
on Day 15. 
 developed generalized hives on  arms  and legs and mild difficulty breathing 
20 minutes after receiving IM Depo-Provera (and  third dose of Gardasil) given

had no prior history of any reactions to De po-Provera or Gardasil (Gardasil dose not 
contain PEG).  was subsequently seen by [CONTACT_129510]/immunologist, and the results 
are pending. Because Depo-Provera contains PEG [ADDRESS_223470] basis for these reported events is not known, the 
use of PEG-containing injectable drugs prior to and during the study is prohibited as a 
precautionary measure (refer to the addendum and Sections 9.3.2 and 9.4.8). 
Allergic reactions to the SC injection of rAvP AL-PEG may be mild, moderate or severe in 
intensity. Reactions may include pruritus,  rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223471]-injection. Longer observations may be re quired at the discretion of the PI. The 
responsible physician should use all appropriate measures for the treatment of allergic 
reactions. Because of the small potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for emergency 
resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be  within easy access during and after the 
rAvPAL-PEG injection. 
In the event of an allergic reactio n, subjects may be asked to see an 
allergist/immunologist and/or  provide up to 3 additional blood samples for antibody 
testing. This additional testin g may occur up to 6 months following the 
final study visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Allergic Reactions 
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of allergic symptoms: 
• Clearing the airway. 
• Vital sign check. 
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189308]. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment. 
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center. 
In addition, clinical judgment  must be used in determining the appropriateness of 
corticosteroid adm
inistration. Acetaminophen 
or ibuprofen (5-10 mg/kg) may also be 
administered. An allergy and/or immunology c onsultation should be sought if necessary. 
7.4.3 Effects of Low Blood Phe 
Insufficient Phe intake or excessive rAvPAL-PEG exposure may 
cause blood Phe 
concentrations to be too low (eg, <  30 ˜m ol/L). Prolonged low blood Phe concentrations can 
result in a catabolic state a ssociated with poor growth and altered 
body functions, including 
mental and physical alterations, loss of appetite, anemia, rashes, and diarrhea. To ensure 
safety during this study, subjects will be monitored closely with frequent blood Phe 
concentration determinations. - protocol.pdf Page 104

The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the effect of long-term admini stration of SC injections of rAvPAL-PEG 
on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of  long-term administration of subcutaneous 
(SC) injections of rAvPAL-P EG in subjects with PKU. 
• To evaluate the immune response to long-te rm adm
inistration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU who participated in Study PAL-002. 
• To evaluate steady-state PK of rA vPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. - protocol.pdf Page 105

9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2, open-label, 
dose-finding study (PAL-002) in 
approximately 35 subjects with PKU. The doses ar e planned to be in the same range 
as those 
tested in PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting 
toxicity was observed in PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in PAL-002 will be enrolled into this study. Diet 
will 
not be altered during the course of this study, except as necessary for safety. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations throughout the study. 
Toxicity will be measured according to th e National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. A Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the study. PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 participants’ 
rAvP AL-PEG dosing will continue in PAL-[ADDRESS_223472]’s dose will be adjusted as 
needed to attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations below 480 µmol/L based upon 
recommendations by [CONTACT_189450] (Burgard, 1999, 
Eur J Pediatr) . Subjects will continue to receive inje ctions in the clinic, administered by 
[CONTACT_96937], but may later be allowed to self -administer doses of study drug at home. Whether 
a subject may be allowed to self-adminis ter study drug doses will be evaluated on an 
individual basis. All of the following cr iteria must be met before a subject may 
self-administer doses of the study drug: 
• The subject is willing and able to administer th e study drug as directed. 
• The sponsor agrees that self-a dministration is appropriate. 
• The subject 
has achieved a favorable dose (i e, the dosage that provides control of 
blood Phe concentrations within the targ et range for a mini mum of 2 weeks). 
• The subject has received appropriate tr aining, including administering doses under 
supervis
ion, until the subject

9.1.1 Management of Local and Systemic Reactions to rAvPAL-PEG 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects Who Have Experienced Hy persensitivity Reactions to 
rAvPAL-PEG or a PEG-containing Product 
Subjects who had a previous reaction to rA vPAL-PEG or a PEG-containing product 
that 
warranted early termination from PA L-001 or PAL-002 are excluded from this 
study.  However, subjects may develop such reactions after en rollment
 in PAL-003. 
Management of such reactions are described 
below. Refer to Figure [IP_ADDRESS].2.1  for a 
flowchart for managing these subjects. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_223474] will be premedicated  
with acetaminophpen and antihistamines 
and/or oral steroids, 1 hour prior to study  drug dosing. Recommended premedications 
are acetaminophen and antihistamine (Claritin is preferred). The dosage will be 
standard (eg, 1000 mg acetaminophen and 10 mg Claritin or 25 to 50 mg oral Benadryl; 
an example for steroids woul d be 70 mg oral prednisone). Because Benadryl can cause 
drowsiness, it should be administered only if  the subject is accompanied by a designated 
driver. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_223475] after PAL-003 enrollment will be premedicated with acetaminophen and antihistamines and/or oral steroids (one hour prior to study drug dosing) and will continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG. 
Reactions to skin prick testing or rAvP AL-PEG administered SC are defined as 
follows: 
Local reaction
: 1 affected location, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema 
or redness at or near the site of injection. Systemic reaction
: more than 1 affected location, ie, cutaneous reaction in more than 
1 area, and/or any other generalized sympto ms, such as hypotension, angioedema or 
anaphylaxis or the involvement of other organ  systems (eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular,

accurately documented according to  applicable state, federal a nd local regulations, ICH GCP, 
and study procedures. 9.4.[ADDRESS_223485]’s response to doses. Dosing is up to a maximum dose per 
week of 
2 mg/kg. 
Dosage is calculated by [CONTACT_189495]’s weight in kilograms (kg) on Day 1 
(predose) by [CONTACT_189455] (in mg/kg). Du ring the study, if the weight of a subject 
changes more than 10% fr
om the measuremen t obtained at baseline or at a previous 
measurement, the subject’s dose may be adjusted to accommodate the change. The change 
must be recorded. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information on calculating dosage. 
The injection sites should be al ternated between doses, ie, upper left arm in Week 1, upper 
right arm in Week 2, etc. Doses may be adm
inistered in any of the common SC areas (upper - protocol.pdf Page 114

Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Adverse Events 
According to the ICH definition, an AE (or a dverse experience) is “any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical 
inves tigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the IP.” 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is described by [CONTACT_189458] “all nox ious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose.” This means that a causal relationship 
between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship cannot be ruled out. 
An AE may include intercurrent illnesses or in juries that represent an exacerbation (increase 
in frequency, 
severity, or specificity) of pr e-existing conditions (eg, worsening of asthma). 
Whenever possible, it is preferable  to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. The reporting period for non-serious AEs is the period from the first administration of study 
drug through the final F/U Visit or at the ETV. If a non-serious AE remai
ns unresolved at the 
conclusion of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_189292] a joint clinical assessment as 
to whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted, and the result s of this assessment 
must be documented. Resolution is defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of 
the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
The Investigator will assess AEs for severity, fo r relationship to IP, a nd as to whether the 
event meets one or more of the definitions of an SAE (refer to Section 10.2). 
The Investigator will 
determine the severity of each AE and will record it on the source 
docum
ents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Grade Description 
Mild No limitation of usual activities 
Moderate Some limitation of usual activities 
Severe Inability to carry out usual activities - protocol.pdf Page 122
 PAL-003 Page 60 of 82 
 
Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarc tion); the event itself , however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome  or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or  functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulato ry reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the 
source documents and AE CRF, using the categories 
defined below. 
Relationship Description 
Not Related Exposure to the IP has not occurred 
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  OR 
The AE is considered likely to be  related to an etiology other than 
the use of the IP; that is, there ar e no facts [evidence] or arguments 
to suggest 
a causal relationship to the IP. 
Possibly 
Related The administration of the IP a nd the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time 
AND 
The AE could be explained equall y well by [CONTACT_189459]. 
Probably 
Related The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time  
AND The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189460]. 
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferre d terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189461], using Me dDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities terminology). - protocol.pdf Page 123

Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  10.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is defined as any AE that: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life threatening, that is, pl aces the subject at immediate ri sk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This definition does not in clude a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Admission of a subj ect to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189294]-p atient as a result of an 
AE, even if the subject is released on the same day, 
qualifies as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. An event qualifies as 
resulting in a persistent or  significant disability or incapacity if it involves a 
substantial disruption of th e subject’s ability to carry  out usual life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include e xperiences of relatively minor or temporary 
medical significance. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is , an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a subject exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event that does not  meet any of the above criteria, but may 
jeopardize the 
subject or require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensiv e treatment in the 
emergency room, allergic bronchospasm, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse.

14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorica l 
data will be summarized usi ng frequency and percent, while continuous data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, num ber of observations, mean, median, standard 
deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical

Proprietary and Confidential February 09, 2009  15 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC) 
The DMC will act in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor subjec t safety and the 
efficacy of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects who par ticipate in the study. Mee tings of the DMC can 
be convened at any time at the discretion of the DMC Chair or the Study Medical Officer. 
The Chair will be notified by [CONTACT_189469]. The DMC will review the study data as soon as it 
is available during the study, on a schedule defined in the DMC Charter, and offer advice on 
whether or not to proceed, modify or termin ate study enrollment on the basis of toxicity. 
Details regarding the DMC membership and safety data to be reviewed by [CONTACT_189500] a charter. 
The responsibilities of the DMC are to: 
• Review the study protocol, informed cons ent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the tr ial, subjects’ risk versus be nefit, and other factors that 
could affect the study outcome. 
• Consider relevant 
information that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189316] 9.1.3. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223507]’s dise ase, that are not part of th is study. Costs associated with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed a nd collected in the way that such 
costs are usually billed and collected. 
The Investigator should contac t BioMarin immediately upon notification that a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_189501] e study. Any subject who 
experiences 
a study-related injury should be inst ructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre-specified medical institution if  possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subjec t should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance w ith, treatment for study-related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s 
instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531] , if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_44532]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin 
is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]-related inju ries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223508] be 
completed using a web–based applic ation that has been validated. Study site 
personnel will be trained
 on the application and will enter the clinical data from source 
documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CR F instructions, blank data fields are not 
acceptable. 
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will 
correct the value by [CONTACT_189502]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system 
will require the site 
personnel to enter a reason for changing the va lue. The documented a udit trail will include 
the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and 
the identity of the operator. BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifi able to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all origin al recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to 
allow direct access to all source data. Subject s (or their legally authorized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when gi ving informed consent. If an Investigator or 
institution refuses to allow acce ss to subject records because of  confidentiality, arrangements 
must be made to allow an “inter view” style of data verification. 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189503] e CRFs with the original source documents 
at the 
study site and evaluate them for completeness and accuracy before designating them as 
“source data verified” (SDV). If an error is di scovered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_189477]. 
The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the response does not fully address the question. This proce ss is repeated until all 
open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, a ll data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electron ically s 
ign the casebook, specifying that the 
information on the CRFs is accurate and complete . The Data Manager, or designee, will then 
set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the - protocol.pdf Page 137

should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_223513] with retention should the PI/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject 
files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to inform the PI/institution as to 
when these documents no longer need to be retained. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223514]

Proprietary and Confidential CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY 
 
Amendment: 2 
Date: October 30, 2009  
 
RATIONALE AND SUMM ARY OF CHANGES 
1. The primary objective of the study has been re vis ed for clarity; multiple doses of SC 
injections of rAvPAL-PEG will be asse ssed for efficacy on blood Phe levels of 
subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU).  
2. Information regarding study drug dose adjust ment (ie, allowabl e dose increases to 
achieve target Phe concentrations [ie,  120-600 µmol/L] and dose de-escalation for 
safety [ie, Phe concentration  < 120 µmol/L]) have been revised for clarity. 
Information regarding dose decr eases relative to changes to subject diet has also been 
clarified. 
3. Additional pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling has been added to allow for additional 
assessment of study drug exposure and accumulation based on PK information from 
the Phase 1 study, PAL-001 (A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Ph armacokinetics of Single, Subcutaneous 
Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subj ects With Phenylketonuria). 
4. The information regarding the 2 subjects who reported serious adverse events in 
Study PAL-001 (A Phase 1, Open-Label, Do se-Escalation Study to Evaluate the 
Safety, Tolerability, 
and Pharmacokinetic s of Single, Subcutaneous Doses of 
rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects With Phenylket onuria) has been up dated. In addition, 
information regarding the future risk of  using other PEG-containing or PEGylated 
injectable drugs has been added. 
5. The Nonclinical Studies section has been updated to include information regarding 
chronic repeat-dose toxicity and toxic okinetic studies in monkeys and rats. 
6. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189320]. 
• The criterio
n for toxicity has been clar ified; subjects who have a drug-related 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade  ≥ 3 event that 
is treatment emergent will stop study drug until resolution of the event. - protocol.pdf Page 147

Section 2/Synopsis (Objectives) The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long-term administration of m ultiple doses of SC 
injections of rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the immune response to long-term admin istration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU who participated in Study PAL 002.  1, 13, 27 
Section 2/Synopsis (Study Design and Plan) This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2, open-label, dose-finding study (Study 
PAL-002) in approximately 35-50 35 subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in 
the same range as those tested in PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in PAL-[ADDRESS_223527]’s blood Phe concentration is 
 < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s diet may be adjusted to increase the amount of dietary Phe 
intake to maintain target blood Phe concentrations of 120-600 µmol/L. Changes to diet 
will be made per the discretion of the Inves tigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Officer.  2, 13, 18, 27 
Section 2/Synopsis 
(Study Design and Plan) At least one interim analysis may be performed by [CONTACT_189510].  In 
addition to the Sponsor, a A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the study  
safety of subjects in the study . The DMC  is an independent committee that will act in an 
advisory capacity to the Sponsor . 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term tr eatment of subjects who are continuing to  11,

take rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 subjects’  participants ’ rAvPAL-PEG dosing will continue 
in PAL-[ADDRESS_223528]’s dose will 
be adjusted as needed to attain or  maintain blood Phe concentrations of below  
120-600 480 µmol/L. Subjects will continue to receive injections in  the clinic, 
administered by [CONTACT_189511] . Whether a subject may be allowed to self administer study drug d Doses 
will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
The dose may be modified at a ny time for safety .  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures w ill be conducted at selected time points as 
shown in Table  2.1.1, Schedule of Events . After the subject’s blood Phe concentration 
has been controlled to within a target range ( below  120-600 480 µmol/L), the subject may 
be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as 
needed but not to exceed 3x/week (fingerstic k tests may be performed more frequently) . 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study .  
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3. The drug becomes commercially available following the a ppropriate marketing 
approval.  The subject has completed the study through the Month 24 visit.  
4. The study is terminated. 
Section 2/Synopsis 
(Study Design and Plan) Dose Modifications:  
After any modifications (increases or decreases) to dose level or frequency, subjects 
should remain in the clinic for observation for at least [ADDRESS_223529] for safety.  
Dose Adjustment Increase Methodology :  2, 11, 27 - protocol.pdf Page 152

Each subject’s dose may be modified based  on the decision of the Investigator, in 
agreement with the Study Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will 
depend on available blood Phe and drug concentrations.   
Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 days  after each dose increase (fingerstick is 
acceptable); more frequent or daily blo od Phe measurements may be performed. Subjects 
must have blood Phe concentration tested [ADDRESS_223530]’s dose 
may be adjusted beginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189486] e nts of  no more than 10-fold higher than 
the subject’s current dose. 
• When adjusting increasing  the dose, a dose may be used  that is between the dose 
cohort l evels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg)  that 
were defined in the previous study (PAL-002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189512], up to one dose per day,  for a maximum  total weekly  dose 
per week  of not to exceed  2.0 mg/kg, including subjects who receive more than 
1 dose/week. Subjects who have increased their dose frequency will have 
additional assessments performed (Interim Dosing Visit).  
• When a dose is adjusted increased  (either by [CONTACT_189513]), the subject must remain in the 
clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223531] modified dose administration, 
and an Investigator will remain on site during this time. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks . 
• Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 days  after each dose increase (fingerstick is - protocol.pdf Page 153

acceptable); more frequent or daily blo od Phe measurements may be performed.  
• The dose may be decreased as appropriate to achieve or maintain a favorable 
blood Phe concentration for safe ty. 
Dose Decrease Methodology  
A subject’s diet should be assessed prior to any dose decreases. Ch anges to diet should 
only be made if blood Phe concentrations are  < 120 µmol/L. If a subject’s blood Phe 
level is  < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s dietary Phe intake should be increased to achieve a  
stable blood Phe concentration of 120-600 µmol/L. If the subject’s blood Phe level is 
 < 120 µmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high Phe diet, the rAvPAL-PEG dose will then be decreased. 
The subject will be asked about any changes to  diet prior to any dose adjustments, and 
any changes to diet should be made per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548] ’s Medical 
Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information 
regarding a subject’s blood Phe (  > 30% change from baseline) and drug concentrations, 
as well as toxicity (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases may occur for safety 
(ie, blood Phe concentration  < 120 µmol/L) or other toxicity that may be improved with a 
lower, more frequent dose.  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 
0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. 
If further dosing adjustments are required to a ttain the target Phe concentration, dosing 
frequency may be reduced.

The subject’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_3433] e Principal Investigator (PI) and the Study 
Medical Officer, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject 
from the study, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose 
level. 
In addition, if 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit drug related  toxicity of a 
treatment-emergent CTCAE grade 3 or greater, further dosing of subjects at that dose 
level will be halted  and no subjects will be treated at a  any higher dose level s will be 
halted  until a safety assessment is completed.  In addition, the Food and Drug

monitor each site on a periodic basis and perform verification of source 
documentation for each subject as well as  other required review processes. 
BioMarin’s Regulatory 
Affair s Department (or designee) will be responsible for 
the timely reporting of serious adverse ev ents (SAEs) to appropriate regulatory 
authorities as required. Some study assessm ents, including administration of study 
drug, may be performed at the subject’s hom e. All assessments performed for this 
study will be administered by [CONTACT_189517].  
Section 7.1/Nonclinical Studies Weekly subcutaneous (SC) administ ration of 80 mg/kg of rAvPAL-PEG 
(approximately 4 IU/mouse) for greater than 2 to
 3 months lowered and stabilized 
plasma  blood Phe concentration from approximately 2000 µM to less than 
200 µ M.  
The safety of rAvPAL-PEG was eval uated in safety pharmacology studies 
(respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], central nervous system [CNS] and cardi ovascular [CV]) and toxicity 
with toxicokinetic studies (single an d 28-day repeated dose) in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys. Overall, in the nonclinical  in all toxicity studies, no 
immune related toxicities  anaphylactoid-like reactions or injection-site reactions 
were noted were seen either systemically or at the injection site . No specific 
polyethylene glycol (PEG)-related histolog ical findings were observed during the 
28-day repeated dose studies. 
The main finding in the 28-day study was the possible drug-related observation of 
minimal to 
slight degeneration of blood vessels of predominantly medium-sized  5, 27 - protocol.pdf Page 158
 PAL-003 Page 14 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Section No./Title Revision Comments Relates to

muscular arteries with a non-dose-depende nt involvement of different organs 
observed in 1 male in the 0.1 mg/kg and 1 male and 1 female in the 1.0 mg/kg 
rAvPAL-PEG dose groups. No degeneration of  the arteries was observed in either 
the control  or animals administered 0 and  0.01 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG. 
Section 7.1/Nonclinical 
Studies Chronic repeat-dose toxicity and toxicoki netic studies were conducted in the rat 
(17/26 weeks) and monkey (39 weeks). In  the 26-week study of  rats, weight loss 
was observed in the rats given 25 mg/kg/dose of rAvPAL-PEG, SC; 
corresponding decreased food consumption was observed in the males. The main 
histological finding was focal -to-multifocal areas of vacuolar degeneration of 
renal tubule cells in the kidney of 3 ma les given 25 mg/kg and 3 females given 
 ≥ 8 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG. This renal tubule finding persisted in the kidney of both 
sexes given  ≥ 8 mg/kg/dose at the end of the 12-week recovery phase without 
evidence of reversibility. Increased vac uolation was observed in  histiocytic cells 
of the liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, mandibular lymph node, and adrenal 
cortex of males given 25 mg/kg/dose and females given  ≥ 8 mg/kg/dose; 
vacuolation of histiocytic cells in the testes were also observed in males given 
25 mg/kg/dose. Both renal tubule vacuolat ion and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been associated with PEG-related catabolism and administration of other 
PEGylated proteins.  
In the 39-week, chronic repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in monkeys, 
dose levels of 7.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/dose rAvPAL -PEG were not tolerated in female 
monkeys and resulted in body weight loss, decreased food consumption, and  5 - protocol.pdf Page 159

hypoactivity. The only adverse microscopic finding was arterial inflammation of 
small and mid-sized arteries in multiple orga ns and/or tissues in most animals that 
were given  ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose rAvPAL-PEG SC twi ce weekly at the end of the 
dosing phase. The inter-individual organ involvement was highly variable; some 
animals had findings in one organ and others had multiple organs with arterial 
inflammation. Additionally, not all arteries had signs of inflammation and arterial 
inflammation was resolved by [CONTACT_189518] 13-week recovery period. A full 
analysis of these findings including the involvement of the anti-drug antibodies, 
antibody isotypes, PEG distribution, and rAvPAL-PEG is ongoing. The no 
observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the 17-week and 39-week studies, in 
rat and monkey, respectively, is 1 mg/ kg/dose.  The NOAEL from these studies 
represents greater than a 100-fold safety  factor over the starting dose in PAL-002.  
Section 7.2/Previous 
Clinical Studies This study is an extension of the second human clinic al study with rAvPAL-PEG 
(Study PAL-002). Study PAL-001, the fi rst-in-human clinical study of 
rAvPAL-PEG, was designed as a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, 
dose-escalation study in approximately 35 25 subjects, 16 to 50 years old, with 
PKU. The doses for this study  are based on data from nonclinical studies and 
PAL-001 and are  planned to be in the same ra nge as those tested in PAL -001 and 
PAL 002 ( 0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection (not to exceed 2.0 mg/kg/week ), 
provided no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in those studies  Study PAL-002 .  27 
Section 7.4/Summary of 
Overall Risks and Benefits It is not expected that data from PAL 001 and  PAL-002 will change the 
assumption that rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity  profile similar to other recombinant  4, 27 - protocol.pdf Page 160

PEGylated non-human enzymes currently in use.  
Section 7.4.1/Toxicity 
Due to Exposure to PEG No indication of PEG-related toxicity at the ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of
 up to 60 mg/kg of SC  rAvPAL-PEG SC .  27 
Section 7.4.2/Toxicity 
Due to an Immunologic 
Reaction This section has been reorganized to include updated safety information from 
Study PAL-001. Presentation of informati on in this section, including section 
numbers, has also been revised.  27 
Section 7.4.2/Toxicity 
Due to an Immunologic 
Reaction The active drug substance in rAvPAL-PEG is  a bacterial protein, and as such, it is 
expected that it may elicit im mune recognition and responses. In animal models, 
the immune response against the foreign protein PAL in rAvPAL PEG has been 
mitigated by [CONTACT_189449].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the immune response may 
be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab). 
Administration of rAvPAL-P EG may lead to anti-PEG antibody formation, and 
the duration of this possible effect is not known. This may limit a subject’s future 
ability to be treated with other PEG- containing (eg, Depo-Provera) or PEGylated 
(eg, PEG-interferon) injectable drugs. It  is therefore recommended that any 
PEG-containing injectable drug administered to subjects after completion of this 
study be done under medical observation.   4, 27

known, the use of PEG containing injectable drugs prior to and during the study is 
prohibited as a precautionary measure (refer to the addendum and Sections 9.3.2  
and 9.4.8 ). 
Two subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL-001 and received the 
protocol-defined single dose of rAvPAL -PEG reported systemic skin reactions 
(generalized skin rash) that were attr ibuted to treatment with study drug. One 
subject received a single dose of 0.001 mg /kg rAvPAL-PEG, and the other subject 
received a single dose of 0.01 mg/kg rAvP AL-PEG. Both of these events were 
reported as serious and followed admini stration of Depo-Pr overa injections 
(medroxyprogesterone injection), an inject able contraception. These allergic 
reactions are thought to be related to the PEG molecule s that are found in both the 
study drug, rAvPAL-PEG, and Depo-Provera. Th ese reactions are not likely to be 
experienced concurrent with ot her birth control medications.

was administered as part of this exam ination. One subject had a mild allergic 
reaction to the test; however, no further re actions or complications were reported 
following subsequent administration of a full dose of Depo-Provera. The subject 
continues to receive regular doses (e very 3 months) of Depo-Provera, and no 
further reactions have been reported to date (15OCT2009). The second subject 
also had a positive reaction to Depo-Provera following administration of the skin 
prick test. When a subsequent full dose  of Depo-Provera was administered,  
developed hives, itching, and chills. Th e subject’s symptoms resolved within

amount of dietary Phe intake  to maintain target blood Phe concentrations of 
120-600 µmol/L . Changes to diet will be made per the discretion of the Investigator 
in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medi cal Officer. For information regarding 
changes to diet for safety and decreases in dose, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Section 9.1/Overall Study Design and Plan At least one interim analysis may be performed by [CONTACT_189510]. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor 
the study safety of subjects in the study. The DMC  is an independent committee 
that will act in an adviso ry capacity to the Sponsor . 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-t erm treatment of subjects who are 
continuing to take rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 subjects’  participants ’ rAvPAL-PEG 
dosing will continue in PA L-[ADDRESS_223538]’s dose will be adjusted as  needed to attain or maintain blood 
Phe concentrations below  of 120-600 480 µmol/L based upon recommendations 
by [CONTACT_189519] (Burgard, 1999, Eur J 
Pediatr ). Subjects will continue to re ceive injections in the  clinic, administered by 
[CONTACT_96937]., but may later be allowed to self administer doses of st udy drug at 
home. Whether a subject may be allowed to self administer study drug d Doses 
will be evaluated on an individual basis. All of the following criteria m ust be met 
before a subject may self administer doses of the study drug:
The subject is willing and able to administer th e study drug as directed.   11, 17, 18, 27 - protocol.pdf Page 166

The subject has achieved a favorable dose (ie, th e dosage that provides control of 
blood Phe concentrations within the targ et range for a mini mum of 2 weeks).  
The dose may be modified at any time for safety.
Evaluations, observations, and procedures  will be conducted at selected time 
points as shown in Table 2.1.[ADDRESS_223539]’s blood Phe 
concentration has been controlled  to within a target range ( below  
120-600 480 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have additional blood draws for 
PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed but not to exceed 3x/week 
(fingerstick tests may be performed more frequently) . 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the In vestigator. 
3. The drug becomes commercially available following the appropriate marketing 
approval.  The subject has completed the study through the Month 24 visit.  
4. The study is terminated.

  Administered Subcutaneously 
During Study PAL-003, subjects may expe
rience hypersensitivity reactions to 
rAvPAL-PEG. The hypersensitivity r eactions are defined as follows:  
Local skin reaction: 
• Skin signs or symptoms  in 1 affected primary location,  1 affected location  
ie, hives, wheals, or swelli ng or an area of erythema,  or redness, 
induration, pain, or itching at or near the site of injection. - protocol.pdf Page 168

[IP_ADDRESS].1/Local Skin 
Reactions After enrollment in PAL 003, s Subjects who have had  a local skin reaction (refer 
to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for definition)  after administration of to rAvPAL-PEG in 
PAL-001, PAL-002, or this study  or a PEG containing product  willmay be 
premedicated orally with acetaminophen and antihistamines and/or oral steroids,  
1 hour prior to study drug dosing. Recommended premedications are 
acetaminophen and antihistamine ( Claritin Zyrtec [cetirizine]  is preferred). 
The dosage will be standard (eg, 1000 mg acetaminophen and 10 mg Claritin 
Zyrtec  or 25 to 50 mg Benadryl [diphenahydramine] ; an example for steroids 
would be 70 mg oral prednisone ). Because Benadryl can cause drowsiness, it may 
be administered only if the subject is  accompanied by a designated driver.  
Symptoms of local reactions may be treat ed with local application of ice and 
non-sedating oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_189323]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If the local skin reaction worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_189520]) even with 
premedication prior to study drug dosing, th e subject must be withdrawn from the 
study and complete an Early Termination Visit.

taken if possible.  Large local skin reactions (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for a 
definition) may or may not be contiguous  to the rAvPAL-PEG injection site. 
The location of the large lo cal skin reaction relative to  the rAvPAL-PEG injection 
site will determine if a subject may re main in the study and continue to be 
administered rAvPAL-PEG. An example of  a large local reaction that is not 
contiguous to the injection site is if an injection took place in the right upper arm 
and there are lesions beyond the elbow join t in the right forearm or lesions beyond 
the shoulder joint on the right trunk.  
Subjects who have large local skin reactions  that are contiguous to the injection 
site may remain in the study. Subjects who have large local skin reactions that are 
not contiguous to the injection site may have additional assessments performed 
(Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit) per Investigator discretion and 
must then be terminated from the study. A decision to terminate a subject from 
the study must be agreed to by [CONTACT_189521] e Sponsor’s Medical 
Officer.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_223542] may remain in the study. Large local skin reactions that  are contiguous to 
the injection site should be managed as local skin reactions (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). For the remainder of the study, subjects must be premedicated - protocol.pdf Page 171

orally with acetaminophen and antihistamines 1 hour prior to study drug dosing. 
Recommended premedications are ace taminophen and antihistamine (Zyrtec 
[cetirizine] is preferred). The dosage will be standard (eg, 1000 mg 
acetaminophen and 10 mg Zyrtec or 25 to 50 mg Benadryl [diphenahydramine]). 
Because Benadryl can cause drowsiness,  it may be administered only if the 
subject is accompanied by a designated driver.

sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein (CRP), total hemolytic complement 
(CH50), and complements C 1 and C 4; and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, 
chemistry, hematology). Subjects will th en be terminated from the study and 
should be scheduled to complete th e Early Termination Visit (refer to 
Section 12.4). 
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of  
ice and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral , or IV antihistamines and/or st eroids as needed (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Section [IP_ADDRESS].3/ Systemic Reactions After enrollment in PAL
003, subjects who have a systemic reaction that includes 
noncutaneous systemic symptoms,  such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_66780], hypotension, or 
angioedema, to rAvPAL PEG or a PEG containing product will be evaluated with 
a skin prick test. If the te st is positive, the subject will be excluded from the study.  
Subjects with prior systemic reactions that  included only skin manifestations to 
rAvPAL PEG or a PEG containing product after PAL 003 enrollment will be 
premedicated with acetaminophen and antihis tamines and/or oral steroids (one 
hour prior to study drug dosing) and will continue to receive rAvPAL PEG.  
Reactions to skin prick testing or rAvPAL PEG administered SC are defined as 
follows:  
Local reaction : 1 affected location, ie, hives, wh eals, or swelling or an area of 
erythema or redness at or near the site of injection.   7, 8, 27 - protocol.pdf Page 173
 PAL-003 Page 29 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Section No./Title Revision Comments Relates to

Systemic reaction : more than 1 affected location, ie, cu taneous reaction in more 
than 1  area, and/or any other generalized  symptoms, such as hypotension, 
angioedema or anaphylaxis or the in volvement of other organ systems (eg, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal).  
Subjects who experience a sy stemic reaction (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a 
definition) after administration of rAvP AL-PEG will be terminated from the 
study. Subjects who experience generalized skin symptoms are included in this 
category. Immediately after the systemic reaction (within 48 hours), subjects with 
generalized skin symptoms must have additional assessments performed for 
safety (ie, Unscheduled Hypersensi tivity Skin Reaction Visit): serum 
anti-rAvPAL-PEG antibodies (anti-PAL IgG, anti-PAL IgM, anti-PEG IgG, 
anti-PEG IgM, anti-rAvPAL-PEG neutralizing antibody, and anti-rAvPAL-PEG 
IgE); serum tryptase level (optional; it is  recommended that this sample be drawn 
immediately after re action); sedimentati on rate; CRP, CH50, C 1, and C 4; and 
clinical laboratory tests (urinalysi s, chemistry, hematology; refer to 
Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). Subjects who have a systemic reaction without generalized skin 
symptoms may have these assessments performed per Investigator discretion. 
Subjects will then be terminated from  the study and should be scheduled to 
complete the Early Termination Visit (refer to Section 12.4 ). 
Section 9.1.2/Dose 
Modifications After any modifications (increases or decreases) to dose level or frequency, 
subjects should remain in the clinic for observation for at least 2 hours following 
the injection of study drug. The Investigator should remain at the site to assess the  2, 27 - protocol.pdf Page 174

subject for safety.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]/Dose 
Increase Methodology Each subject’s dose may be modified base d on the decision of the Investigator, in 
agreement with the Study Medical Offi cer. Decisions regarding dose increases 
will depend on available blood Ph e and drug concentrations.  
Depending upon the response to rAvPAL -PEG in PAL-002, an individual   
subject’s dose may be adjusted be ginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the subject’s current dose. 
• When adjusting increasing  the dose, a dose may be used that is between the 
dose cohort l evels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg)  
that were defined in the previous study (PAL-002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189512], up to one dose per day,  for a maximum  total weekly  dose 
per we ek of not to exceed  2.0 mg/kg, including subj ects who receive more 
than 1 dose/week . Subjects who increase their dose frequency should perform 
the Interim Dosing Visit assessments (refer to Section 12.3.5 and Tables 2.1.2  
and 2.1.3).  
• When a dose is adjuste dincreased  (either by [CONTACT_189522]), the subject must remain in 
the clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223544] modified dose administration, and an Investigator will remain on site during this time. 
Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks.

• Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 da ys after each dose increase (fingerstick 
is acceptable); more frequent or daily blood Phe measurements may be 
performed.  
• The dose may be decreased as appropriate to achieve or maintain a favorable 
blood Phe concentration for safety.  
Subjects must have blood Phe concentrati on tested [ADDRESS_223545] be a minimum of 2  weeks after each dose adjustment before any 
additional dose  adjustments may be made, so that blood Phe concentrations can 
be assessed . 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Dose Decrease Methodology  
A subject’s diet should be assessed prior to any dose decreases. Changes to diet 
should only be made if blood Phe concentrations are  < 120 µmol/L. If a subject’s 
blood Phe level is  < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s dietary Phe intake should be 
increased to achieve a stable blood Phe concentration of 120-600 µmol/L. If the 
subject’s blood Phe level is  < 120 µmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high Phe diet, the 
rAvPAL-PEG dose will then be decrease d. The subject will be asked about any 
changes to diet prior to any dose adjustme nts, and any changes to diet should be 
made per the discretion of the Investigat or in consultation with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Officer.  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s 
Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available 
information regarding a subject’s blood Phe ( >30% change from baseline) and   - protocol.pdf Page 176
 PAL-003 Page 32 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Section No./Title Revision Comments Relates to

drug concentrations, as well as toxicity (any hypersensit ivity reaction as defined 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie, blood Phe 
concentration  < 120 µmol/L) or other toxicity that  may be improved with a lower, 
more frequent dose.  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 
0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to  decrease dose in between these 
specified dose levels. If furt her dosing adjustments are requ ired to attain the ta rget 
Phe concentration, dosing frequency may be reduced.

The doses for this study are based upon the results of nonclin ical studies and 
PAL-001.  Findings in cynomolgus monkeys dosed  with a single administration of 
60 mg/kg rAvPAL PEG included severe morbidity, decrea sed plasma Phe 
concentration, decreased protein synt hesis, and GI lesions. Plasma Phe 
concentrations were reduced to below th e level of detection in the lower dose 
groups, without other findings (refer to Section 7.1 ). The no observable adverse 
effect level (NOAELs) from nonclinical studi es in rats and monkeys represents a 
greater than 100-fold safety  factor over the starting dose administered in PAL-

TITLE OF STUDY: 
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open-Label Dose -Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability 
of Multiple  Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU 
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL-003 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 8 centers in the [LOCATION_002] 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2 
STUDY RATIONALE: 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylk etonuria (PKU) safely achieve 
lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine  (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL-PEG) is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine 
hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control 
blood Phe concentrations, which may have additional c linical benefits. This study is an extension of 
the dose-finding study (Study PAL-002). Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whether long-term dosing of rAvPAL-PEG is safe a nd can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations 
in PKU subjects.  
OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long-term administration of multiple doses of  SC injections of 
rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of  long-term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. 
• To evaluate the immune re sponse to long-t erm ad ministration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. 
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PK U. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223567]: rAvPAL-PEG

STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2, open-label, dose-finding study (Study PAL-002) in 
35-50  subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be  in the same range as 
those tested in PAL-002 
(0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting toxicity was observed in PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in PAL-[ADDRESS_223568]’s blood Phe concentration is  < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s diet may be 
adjusted to increase the amount of dietary Phe intake to maintain target blood Phe 
concentrations of 120-600 µmol/L. Changes to diet will be made per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer  Institute (NCI) Common Term inology 
Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. 
At least one interim analysis may be performed by [CONTACT_189510]. In addition to 
the Sponsor, a  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will m
onitor the safety of subjects in the study. 
The DMC  is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor . 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 subjects’  rAvPAL-PEG dosing will continue in PAL-
[ADDRESS_223569]’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or 
maintain blood Phe concentrations of  120-600 µmol/L. D oses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
Evaluations, observations, and proce dures will be conducted at selected ti me points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been cont rolled to within  
a target range ( 120-600 µmol/L), the subject 
may be asked to have additional blood draw s for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed 
but not to exceed 3x/week (fingerstick tests may be performed more frequently) . 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the In vestigator. 
3.  The subject has completed the study through the Month [ADDRESS_223570]: rAvPAL-PEG

Dose Modifications : 
After any modifications (increases or decreases) to dose level or frequency, subjects should 
remain in the clinic 
for observation for at least [ADDRESS_223571] for safety. 
Dose Increase  Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the de cision of the Investigator, in agreement with the 
Study Medica
l Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on blood Phe and drug 
concentrations .  
Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 days aft er each dose increase (fing erstick is acceptable); 
more frequent or daily blood Phe me
asurements may be performed.   
Depending upon the response to rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-002, an individual subject’s dose may be 
adjusted beginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189486] e nts of no more than 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing  the dose, a dose may be used th at is between the dose levels (0.001, 
0.003, 0.01, 0
.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg)  that were defined in the previous 
study (PAL-002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed  2.0 mg/kg, including subjects who receive more than 1 dose/week . 
Subjects who increase their dose frequency will have additional assessments 
performed (Interim Dosing Visit).  
• When a dose is increased (either by [CONTACT_189535]), the subject must remain in the clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223572] modified dose administration, and an Investigator will remain on site 
during this time. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. 
• Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 days  after each dose increase (fingerstic k 
is 
acceptable); more freque nt 
or daily blood  Phe measurements may be performed. 
Dose Decrease Methodology  
A subject’s diet should be assessed prior to any dose decreases. Changes to diet should only be 
made if a subject’s blood Phe concentrations  < 120 µmol/L. If a subject’s blood Phe level is - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223573]: rAvPAL-PEG

 < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s dietary Phe intake should be increased to achieve a stable blood Phe 
concentration of 120-600 µmol/L. If the subject’s blood Phe level is  < 120 µmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high 
Phe diet, the rAvPAL-PEG dose will then be d ecreased. The subject will be asked about any 
changes to diet prior to any dose adjustments, and any changes to diet should be made per the discretion of the Investigator in consulta tion with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on  available information regarding a subject’s 
blood Phe (
 > 30% change from baseline) and drug concentrations, as well as toxicity (any 
hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie, blood Phe concentration 
 < 120 µmol/L) or other toxicity that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose. 
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in  between these spec ified 
dose levels. If further 
dosing adjustments are required to attain the targ et Phe concentration, dosing frequency may be 
reduced.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] : 
If an individual subject exhibits toxicity of a treatment-emergent  CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_223574]’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1268] (PI) and the Study Medical O fficer, and a decision will then be made whether to 
discontinue the subject from the study, restart dosi ng at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a 
lower dose level. 
In addition, if 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit toxicity of a treatment-emergent  CTCAE 
grade 3 
or greater, further dosing of subjects at that dose level will be halted and no subjects will be 
treated at a higher dose level until a safety assessment is completed. In addition, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) will be notified of this occurrence.

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: 
Efficacy: 
Blood Phe concentrations will be measured. 
Immunogenicity: 
The presence of antibodies will be assessed. 
Safety: 
Safety will be evaluated on the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and clinically significant changes in 
vital signs or laboratory test 
results. 
Pharmacokinetic: 
Plasma concentrations of rAvPAL- PEG will be measured when steady-st ate levels of Phe are attained.  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Sample Size : 
Subjects who participated in PAL-002 may be enrolled into this study. No formal sample size 
calculation was conducted. 
Safety Analysis : 
All subjects who receive any amount of study drug in this study and have postdose safety 
information will 
be included in the safety analyses. 
Safety will be evaluated on the incidence of AEs, including serious AEs (SAEs), and clinically 
significant changes in vital signs and laboratory test results. 
Efficacy Analysis : 
Data from all 
subjects who receive any amount of study drug and who have any post-treatment 
efficacy  
data will be included in the efficacy analysis. 
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point  will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, median, m
inimum, a nd maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration 
from baseline to each scheduled time point and presence/absence of antibodies will also be 
summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223581]: rAvPAL-PEG

Pharmacokinetic Analysis: 
Data from all subjects who complete at least 2 weeks of the study will be included in the PK analysis. 
Steady-state 
PK (predose samples) of rAvPAL-PEG  will be evaluated in PKU subjects after the 
subject has achieved and maintained target blood Phe concentration ( 120-6 0
0 μmol/L) for a minimum 
of 2 weeks (to allow assessment of blood Phe concentrations) and no further dose modification is 
planned. Should data become available from PAL-002 that indicate study drug accumulation should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added for PK analysis as needed but not to exceed 3x/week. - protocol.pdf Page 204

Proprietary and Confidential 7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of phenylalanine ammo nia lyase ( rAvPAL-PEG) is contained in 
the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator should review th is document prior to initiating 
this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The murine model of phenylketonuria (PKU) BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2), a mouse line that is 
deficient in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity (Shedlovsky, 1993, Genetics) , was 
used for in vivo screening and pharmacodyna mic studies. This m ouse model exhibits 
characteristics similar to those seen in PKU patients, including hyperphenylalaninemia 
(baseline plasma phenylalanine [Phe] concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) and 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Weekly subcutaneous (SC) ad ministration of 80 mg /kg of rAvPAL-PEG 
(approximately 4 IU/mouse) for greater than 2 to 3 months lowered and stabilized plasma 
Phe concentration from approximately 2000 µM to less than 200 µM. A similar profile of 
Phe reduction was also seen in ENU2 mice administered wild-type AvPAL-PEG 
(4 IU/mouse) over [ADDRESS_223600] udies (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
central nervous system [CNS] and cardiovascul ar [CV]) and toxicity with toxicokinetic 
studies (single and 28-day repeated dose) in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. Overall, in the 
nonclinical studies, no anaphylactoid-like reactions or injection-site reactions were 
noted. No specific polyethylene glycol (PEG)-relat ed histological findings were observed 
during the 28-day repeated dose studies. Findings in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with a single administration of 
60 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG included  reduced food consumption, dehydration, body weight loss, 
hypoactivity, hypothermia,decreased plasma 
Phe c oncentration, decreased protein synthesis, 
and gastrointestinal (GI) lesions . Plasma Phe concentrations were also reduced to below the - protocol.pdf Page 221
 PAL-003 Page 27 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential level of detection in the 4 and 12 mg/kg dos e groups, but without similar toxicological 
consequences, implying that the physiological re gulation of Phe levels may be an important 
factor for influencing morbidity.  
The main finding in the 28-day study was the po ssible drug-related observation of minimal to 
slight degeneration 
of blood vessels of predomin antly medium-sized muscular arteries with a 
non-dose-dependent involvement of different orga ns observed in 1 male in the 0.1 mg/kg and 
1 male and 1 female in the 1.0 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG dose groups. No degeneration of the 
arteries was observed in either the control or animals administered 0.01 mg/kg 
rAvPAL-PEG.  
The half-life of rAvPAL-PEG administered to normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 
250 m
g/kg, was 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_223601] area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)-dose linearity. In the cynomolgus monkey after SC 
administration of rAvPAL-PEG , the half-life was 65 hours at  4 mg/kg, 71 hours at 12 mg/kg, 
and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and m onkey appear to have similar characteristics. The following 
findings were noted: (1) a 1-compartment mode l with first-order ab sorption appears to 
describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL-PEG after single-dose admini stration, (2) absorption 
is slow and there is a long absorption peri od after SC administration to maximum plasma 
concentration, along with a long half-life, (3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there 
does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) AUC and the maximum plasma concentration (C
max) are roughly linearly proportional. 
Chronic repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic studies were conducted in the rat (17/26 weeks) and monkey (39 weeks). In th e 26-week study of rats, weight loss was 
observed in
 the rats given 25 mg/kg/dose of rAvPAL-PEG, SC; corresponding 
decreased food consumption was observed in the males. The main histological finding 
was focal-to-multifocal areas of vacuolar de generation of renal tubule cells in the 
kidney of 3 males given 25 mg/kg and 3 females given  ≥ 8 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG. 
This renal tubule finding persisted in the kidney of both sexes given  ≥ 8 mg/kg/dose at 
the end of the 12-week recovery phase wi thout evidence of rev ersibility. Increased 
vacuolation was observed in histiocytic cell s of the liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, 
mandibular lymph node, and adrenal cortex of males given 25 mg/kg/dose and females 
given  ≥ 8 mg/kg/dose; vacuolation of histiocytic cel ls in the testes were also observed in 
males given 25 mg/kg/dose. Both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223602] been associated with PEG-related catabolism and administration of other 
PEGylated proteins. 
In the 39-week, chronic repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic study in monkeys, dose 
levels of 7.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/dose rAvPAL-PEG w
ere not tolerated in female monkeys 
and resulted in body weight loss, decreased food consumption, and hypoactivity. 
The only adverse microscopic finding was art erial inflammation of  small and mid-sized 
arteries in multiple organs and/or ti ssues in most animals that were given  ≥ 3 
mg/kg/dose rAvPAL-PEG SC twice weekly  at the end of the dosing phase. The 
inter-individual organ involvement was highly  variable; some animals had findings in 
one organ and others had multiple organs with  arterial inflammation. Additionally, not 
all arteries had signs of infl ammation and arterial inflam mation was resolved by [CONTACT_189539] 13-week recovery period. A full analysis of these findings including the 
involvement of the anti-drug antibodies, antibody isotypes, PEG distribution, and rAvPAL-PEG is ongoing. The no observable  adverse effect le vel (NOAEL) for the 
17-week and 39-week studies, in rat and monkey, respectively, is 1 mg/kg/dose.  
The NOAEL from these studies represents grea ter than a 100-fold sa fety factor over the 
starting dose in PAL-002. 
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
This study is an extension of the second human clinic al study with rAvPAL-PEG 
(Study PAL-002). Study PAL-001, the first-in-h uman clinical study of rAvPAL–PEG, was 
designed as a Phase 1, open-label, si ngle-dose, dose-escalation study in 25 subjects, 16 to 
50 years old, with PKU. The doses for this study  are based on data from nonclinical 
studies and PAL-001 and are  0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection (not to exceed 
2.0 mg/kg/week , provided no dose-lim
iting toxicity was observed in Study PAL-002. 
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited dise ase characterized by [CONTACT_189448] (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw-Hill) . Approximately 
1 in every 10,000 infants in North 
America is born with PKU (Scriver CR, 
2001, McGraw-Hill). Left untreated, PAH 
deficiency is associated with an abnormally el evated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to 
the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr.)  and can result in a variety of neuropathologic 
conditions, including mental retardation, mi crocephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and 
behavioral abnormalities (Scriver CR, 2001, McGraw -Hill). The brains of untreated patients 
with PKU show evidence of hypomyelination an d gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, 
and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated - protocol.pdf Page 223
 PAL-003 Page 29 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Phe during fetal development leads to severe me ntal retardation and can cause microcephaly, 
growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, Pediatrics), (Koch, 2003, 
Pediatrics), (Lee, 2003, Pediatrics), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics), (Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics), 
(Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr.) . 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of  PKU involves adherence to low-Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containi ng foods. Implementation of a 
Phe-restricted diet in infanc y significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents 
many of the neuropathologic manifestations of  PKU, including severe mental retardation. 
However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, 
and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of 
natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet) . 
The need exists for a treatmen t that will help individuals with PKU safely achieve lifelong, 
reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe ) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvP AL-PEG) is a potential substitute for the 
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is  defective in individuals with PKU. 
rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentra tions, which may have additional clinical 
benefits. This study is an extension of th e dose-finding study (PAL- 002). Administration of 
rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whethe r long-term dosing of rAvPAL-PEG is safe 
and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from PAL-002 w ill change the assumption that rAvPAL-PEG has 
a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human enzymes currently in 
use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall in to 2 main categories: to xicity due to exposure 
to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. 
Other adverse events (AEs) that could occu r with rAvPAL-PEG in clude injection-site 
reactions and other general symptoms. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_223603] been a few 
reports of PEG-related AEs in humans; cumu lative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, ol iguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG 
exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG 
dose range (6 g per week) is at least - protocol.pdf Page 224
 PAL-003 Page 30 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential 80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely 
used medicines and other compounds that are admi nistered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189286] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG-re lated toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of  up to 60 mg/kg 
rAvPAL-PEG SC. 
In this study, subjects will be monitored closely with urine examinations and blood 
chemistries to follow kidney 
function. 
7.4.2 Toxicity Due to an Immunologic Reaction 
The active drug substance in rAvPAL-PEG is a b acterial protein, and as such, it is expected 
that it may elicit 
immune recogni tion and responses. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the immune 
response may be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab) . In vivo 
and in vitro experiments have shown that PEGy lation of proteins and cells can attenuate the 
immunological response (Scott, 1997, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs.) . 
PEGylation has been effective in reducing an ti-rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model, 
although PEGylation does not eliminate an tibody formation. Although PEGylation of 
rAvPAL may have a significant effect on reducing the immunogenici ty of the molecule, it is 
reasonable to expect that some individuals may exhibit immune responses upon exposure to 
the drug. These immune responses may be clinic ally irrelevant, cause symptoms of various 
degrees, or lead to neutralizati on of biological activity. Subjects pa rticipating in clinical trials 
will be monitored closely with specific anti body titers, sedimentation rates, and complete 
blood counts (CBCs). 
PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.)  (Harris, 2003, 
Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), however, antibodies against PEG may form
 when PEG is bound to 
compounds. (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug.Discov.) (Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.)  In some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in any 
significant clinical effects in humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . 
In some individuals, anti-PEG antibodies may be pre-existing due to previous exposure to 
PEG in other products. Anti-PEG antibodies ha ve been associated with nonresponsiveness 
against therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.). 
Administration of rAvPAL-PEG may lead to  anti-PEG antibody formation, and the 
duration of this possible ef fect is not known. This  may limit a subject’s future ability to 
be treated with other PEG-containing (eg, Depo-Provera) or PEGylated 
(eg, PEG-interferon) injectable drugs.  It is therefore recommended that any - protocol.pdf Page 225

Proprietary and Confidential PEG-containing injectable drug administered to subjects after completion of this study 
be done under medical observation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Skin Reactions 
Two subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL-001 and received the protocol-defined 
single dose of rAvPAL-PEG reported systemic  skin reactions (generalized skin rash) 
that 
were attributed to treatment with study drug. One subject received a single dose of 
0.001 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG, and the other subject  received a single dose of 0.01 mg/kg 
rAvPAL-PEG. Both of these events were reported as serious and followed 
administration of Depo-Provera injectio ns (medroxyprogesterone injection), an 
injectable contraception. These allergic reactions are thought to be related to the PEG molecules that are found in both the study drug, rAvPAL-PEG, and Depo-Provera. These reactions are not likely to be exp erienced concurrent with other birth control 
medications. 
The 2 subjects were administered study drug during PAL-001 and then experienced an 
allergic reaction following an 
injection of Depo-Provera. The symptoms of the reactions 
were hives on the arms and legs and diffi culty breathing. The symptoms for both 
subjects resolved within 1 day following treatment with medication, including the 
). Bo th subjects were examined by [CONTACT_189540] d participation in PAL-001. A skin prick test with Depo-
Provera was administered as part of this ex amination. One subject had a mild allergic 
reaction to the test; however, no further reactions or complications were reported following subsequent administration of a full dose of Depo-Provera. The subject 
continues to receive regular doses (every 3 months) of Depo-Provera, and no further 
reactions have been reported to date (15OCT2009). The second subject also had a positive reaction to Depo-Provera following ad ministration of the sk in prick test. When 
a subsequent full dose of Depo-Provera wa s administered,  developed hives, itching, 
and chills. The subject’s symptoms resolve d within [ADDRESS_223604] basis for these reported 
events and their duration  is not known, the use of PEG-cont aining injectable drugs prior to, 
during, and after  this study is prohibited as a precautionary measure (refer to Sections 9.3.2 
and Section  9.4.8.).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Allergic Reactions 
Allergic re
actions to the SC injectio n of rAvPAL-PEG may be mild, moderate , or severe in 
intensity. Reactions may include pruritus,  rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or 
anaphylaxis. Clinical assessments should be conducted for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223605]-injection. Longer observations may be required at the discretion of the PI. The responsible physician should use all appropriate measures for the treatment of allergic reactions. Because of the small potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be  within easy access during and after the 
rAvPAL-PEG injection. 
In the event of an allergic reaction, subjects may be asked to see an allerg ist/immunologist 
and/or 
provide up to 3 additional blood sample s for antibody testing. This additional testing 
may occur up to 6 months following the final study visit. The following measures are recommended for the treatment of allergic symptoms: 
• Clearing the airway. 
• Vital sign check. 
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment. 
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center. 
In addition, clinical judgment  must be used in determining the appropriateness of 
corticosteroid administration. Acetaminophen 
or ibuprofen (5-10 mg/kg) may also be 
administered. An allergy and/or immunology c onsultation should be sought if necessary.

7.4.3 Effects of Low Blood Phe 
Insufficient Phe intake or excessive rAvPAL-PEG exposure may 
cause blood Phe 
concentrations to be too low (eg, <  30 µmol/L). Prolonged low blood Phe concentrations can 
result in a catabolic state a ssociated with poor growth and altered 
body functions, including 
mental and physical alterations, loss of appetite, anemia, rashes, and diarrhea. To ensure 
safety during this study, subjects will be monitored closely with frequent blood Phe 
concentration determinations. If a subject’s blood Phe concentration is too low, the 
subject’s diet, current dose of stud y drug, or both may be adjusted.  - protocol.pdf Page 228

Proprietary and Confidential 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of a Phase 2, open-label, 
dose-finding study (PAL-002) in 
35-50  subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to  be in the same range 
as those tested in 
PAL-002 (0.001 through 1.0 mg/kg per injection), provided no dose-limiting toxicity was 
observed in PAL-002. 
Only subjects who completed participation in  PAL-[ADDRESS_223606]’s blood Phe concentration is 
 < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s diet may be adjusted to increase the amount of dietary Phe 
intake  to maintain target blood Phe concentrations of 120-600 µmol/L . Changes to diet will 
be made per the discretion of the Investi gator in consultation with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Officer. For information regarding ch anges to diet for safety and decreases in 
dose, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations throughout the study. 
Toxicity will be measured according to th e National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. 
At least one interim analysis may be p erformed by [CONTACT_189510]. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a  Data Monitoring Committ ee (DMC) 
will monitor the  safety 
of subjects in the study. The DMC is an i ndependent committee that will act in an 
advisory capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 subjects’  rAvPAL-PEG dosing will co ntinue 
in PAL-[ADDRESS_223607]’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain 
or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 120-600  µmol/L. D oses will be evaluated on an 
individual basis.  Evaluations, observations, and pr ocedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 2.1.[ADDRESS_223608] ’s blood Phe concentration has been 
controlled to within 
a target rang

9.1.1 Management of Local and Systemic Reactions to rAvPAL-PEG 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects Who Have Had Previous Hypersensitivity Reactions to 
rAvPAL-PEG or a PEG-containing Product 
Subjects who had a previous systemic reaction to rAvPAL-PEG or a PEG-containing product 
that warranted early term
ination from 
PAL-[ADDRESS_223610] had a previous local skin  reaction to rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-002 are 
eligible to participate in this study.  Subjects may develop systemic, large local skin, or 
local skin  reactions after enrollment in PAL-003. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for definitions of 
systemic and local skin reactions. For management of hypersensitiv
ity reactions that 
occur during this study, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Hypersensitivity Reac tions to rAvPAL-PEG Administered 
Subcutaneously 
During Study PAL-003, subjects 
may exp erience hypersensitivi ty reactions to 
rAvPAL-PEG. The hypersensitivity reactions are defined as follow
s: 
Local skin reaction:  
• Skin signs or symptoms in 1 affected primary location, ie, hives, wheals, or 
swelling or an area of erythema, redness , induration, pain, or itching at or near the 
site of injection. 
Large local skin reaction:  
• Skin signs or symptoms, ie, hives, w
heals, or swelling or an area of erythema, 
redness, or 
induration with pain or it ching that extends beyond the site of 
injection by [CONTACT_3450] 6 inches (15 cm) and/or signs or symptoms that are 
not contiguous to the injection site. These may be associated with a low risk of 
systemic symptoms or anaphylaxis upon re-exposure and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction when not contiguous to the injection site. 
Systemic reaction (including generalized skin symptoms):  - protocol.pdf Page 231
 PAL-003 Page 39 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_223611] had a local skin reaction (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for definition)  after 
administration of  rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-001, PAL-002, or this study  may be premedicated 
with acetaminophen and antihistami
nes 1 hour prior to study drug dosing. Recommended 
premedications are acetam inophen and antihistamine ( Zyrtec [cetirizine]  is preferred). 
The dosage will be standard (eg, 1000 mg acetaminophen and 10 mg Zyrtec  or 25 to 50 mg 
oral Benadryl [diphenahydramine] ). Because Benadryl can cause drowsiness, it should be 
administered only if the subject is  accompanied by a designated driver. 
Symptoms of local reactions may be treated with local application of ice and 
non-sedating oral and/or to pi[INVESTIGATOR_189327]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_28709] (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
If the local skin reaction worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_189520]) even  with premedication 
prior to study drug dosing, the subject must be withdrawn from the study and complete 
an Early Termination Visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Large Local Skin Reactions 
Large local skin reactions (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a definition) may or may not be 
contiguous to the rAvPAL-PEG injection si te. The location of the large local skin 
reaction relative to the rAvP AL-PEG injectio
n site will determine if a subject may 
remain in the study and continue to be administered rAvPAL-PEG. An example of a 
large local reaction that is not contiguous to  the injection site is if an injection took 
place in the right upper arm and there are lesions beyond the elbow joint in the right 
forearm or lesions beyond the shou lder joint on the right trunk.  
Subjects who have large local skin reactions th at are contiguous to the injection site 
may remain in the study. Subjects who have la rge local skin react ions that are not 
contiguous to the injection site may have additional assessments performed 
(Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visi t) per Investigator discretion and must 
then be terminated from
 the study. A decisi on to terminate a subject from the study 
must be agreed to by [CONTACT_189541]’s Medical Officer.

Proprietary and Confidential remain in the study. Large local skin reactions that are contiguous to the injection site 
should be managed as local skin reactions (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].1). For the remainder 
of the study, subjects must be premedic ated orally with acetaminophen and 
antihistamines 1 hour prior to study drug dosing. Recommended premedications are 
acetaminophen 
and antihistamine (Zyrtec [cetirizine] is preferred). The dosage will be 
standard (eg, 1000 mg acetaminophen and 10 mg Zyrtec or 25 to 50 mg Benadryl 
[diphenahydramine]). Because Benadryl can cause drowsiness, it may be administered 
only if the subject is accompanied by a designated driver.  
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be  treated with local applicat ion of ice and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as needed (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_223613] additional  assessments performed 
(ie, Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Skin Re action Visit) immediately after the reaction 
(within 48 hours): serum anti-rAvPAL-PEG antibodies (anti-PAL immunoglobulin G 
[IgG], anti-PAL immunoglobulin M [IgM], anti-PEG IgG, anti-PEG IgM, anti-rAvPAL-PEG neutralizing antibody, and anti-rAvPAL-PEG immunoglobulin E [IgE]); 
serum tryptase level; sedimentation rate; C-reactive protein (CRP), total hemolytic complement (CH50), and complements C
1 and C 4; and clinical laboratory tests 
(urinalysis, chemistry, hematology). Subjects will then be terminated from the study 
and should be scheduled to complete the Early Termination Visit (refer to Section 12.4).  
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be  treated with local applicat ion of ice and

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Systemic Reactions 
Subjects who experience a systemic reaction (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a definition) 
after administration 
of rAvPAL-PEG will be terminated from the study. Subjects who 
experience generalized skin symptoms are in cluded in this category. Immediately after 
the systemic reaction (within 48 hours), subjec ts with generalized skin symptoms must 
have additional assessments performed for safety (ie, Unscheduled Hypersensitivity - protocol.pdf Page 235
 PAL-003 Page 41 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Skin Reaction Visit): serum anti-rAvPAL- PEG antibodies (anti-PAL IgG, anti-PAL 
IgM, anti-PEG IgG, anti-PEG IgM, anti-rAvPAL-PEG neutralizing antibody, and 
anti-rAvPAL-PEG IgE); serum tryptase leve l (optional; it is recommended that this 
sample be drawn immediately after rea ction); sedimentation rate; CRP, CH50, C 1, and 
C4; and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology; refer to 
Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). Subjects who have a systemic reaction without generalized skin 
symptoms may have these assessments performed per Investigator  discretion. Subjects 
will then be terminated from 
the study and should be scheduled to complete the Early 
Termination Visit (refer to Section 12.4). 
9.1.2 Dose Modifications 
After any modifications (increases or decreases) to dose level or frequency, subjects should remain in the clinic fo r observation for at least [ADDRESS_223614] for safety. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on th e decision of the Inves tig
ator, in agreement 
with the Study Medical Officer. Decisions rega
rding dose increases will depend on blood 
Phe and drug concentrations . 
Depending upon the response to rAvPAL-PEG in PAL-002, an individual  subject’s dose 
may be adjusted beginning on Day 1 of PAL-003 as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189491] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose.  
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 
0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 mg/kg) that were defined in the previous 
study (PAL-002). 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189542] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed  2.0 mg/kg , including subjects who receive more than 
1 dose/week . Subjects who increase their dose frequency should perform the 
Interim Dosing Visit assessments (refer to Section 12.3.5 and Table 2.1.2  and 
Table 2.1.3 ). 
• When a dose is increased (either by [CONTACT_189543]), the subject must rema in in the clinic for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223615] modified dose administra tion, and an Investigator will remain on 
site during this time. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. - protocol.pdf Page 236
 PAL-003 Page 42 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential • Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 days after each dose increase (fingerstick is 
acceptable); more frequent or daily blood  Phe measurements may be performed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology 
A subject’s diet should be assessed prior to any dose decreases. Changes to diet should 
only be made if blood Phe concentrations are  < 120 µmol/L. If a subject’s blood Phe 
level is  < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s dietary Phe intake should be increased to achieve a 
stable blood Phe concentration of 120-600 µmo l/L. If the subject’s blood Phe level is 
 < 120 µmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high Phe diet, the rA vPAL-PEG dose will then be decreased. 
The subject will be asked about any changes to diet prior to any dose adjustments, and 
any changes to diet should be made per the di scretion of the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s 
Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available 
information regarding 
a subject’s blood Phe (  > 30% change from baseline) and drug 
concentrations, as well as toxicity (any hypersensitivity reaction as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Dose decreases may occur for safe ty (ie, blood Phe concentration 
 < 120 µmol/L) or other toxicity that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose. 
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (1.0, 0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required to 
attain the target Phe concentration, 
dosing frequency may be reduced.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_223616]’s data will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_189451] (PI) and the Study Medical Officer, and a decision 
will then be made whether to discontinue th e subject from the study, restart dosing at the 
same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level. In addition, if [ADDRESS_223617] ration (FDA) will be notified of this 
occurrence.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223618] meet all of the following criteria:

 Removal of Subjects from T reatment or Assessment 
Subjects (or their legally authori zed representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. Th e Investigator must w ithdraw from the study 
any subject who requests to be  withdrawn. A subject’s partic ipation in the study may be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her 
clinical judgment. When possibl e, the tests and evaluations lis ted for the Early Termination 
Visit should be carried out (refer to Section 12.4 ). 
BioMarin must be notified of all subject wit hdrawals as soon as possible. BioMarin also 
reserves the right to discontinue  the study at any time 
for eith er clinical or administrative 
reasons and to discontinue pa rticipation by [CONTACT_189494]. 
Reasons for which the Investigator or BioM arin may withdraw a subject from the study 
include, 
but are not limited to, the following: - protocol.pdf Page 239

and study procedures. 9.4.[ADDRESS_223624]’s response to doses. Dosing is up to a maximum dose per 
week of 
2 mg/kg. 
Dosage is calculated by [CONTACT_189495]’s weight in kilograms (kg) on Day 1 
(predose) by [CONTACT_189455] (in mg/kg). Du ring the study, if the weight of a subject 
changes more than 10% fr

must be recorded. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information on calculating dosage. 
The injection sites should be al ternated between doses, ie, upper left arm in Week 1, upper 
right arm in Week 2, etc. Doses may be adm
inistered in any of the common SC areas (upper 
arm, thigh, abdomen). If dose volume is such th at a dose will be divi ded and given in more 
than 1 injection site, it is preferable to use both arms, both legs, or both sides of the abdomen. 
Subjects may require more than 1 injection per dose, depending upon site policy (ie, some 
institutions do not permit a single SC injec tion of greater than 2 mL).

Proprietary and Confidential 10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Adverse Events 
According to the ICH definition, an AE (or a dverse experience) is “any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical 
inves tigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and uninte nded sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the IP.” 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is described by [CONTACT_189458] “all nox ious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose.” This means that a causal relationship 
between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship cannot be ruled out. 
An AE may include intercurrent illnesses or in juries that represent an exacerbation (increase 
in frequency, severity, or specificity) of pr e-existing conditions (eg, worsening of asthma). 
Whenever 
possible, it is preferable  to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. The reporting period for non-serious AEs is the period from the first administration of study 
drug through the final F/U Visit or at the ETV. If a non-serious AE remai
ns unresolved at the 
conclusion of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_189292] a joint clinical assessment as 
to whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted, and the result s of this assessment 
must be documented. Resolution is defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of 
the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
The Investigator will assess AEs for severity, fo r relationship to IP, a nd as to whether the 
event meets one or more of the definitions of a serious adverse event (SAE; refer to 
Section 10.2). 
The Investig
ator will determine the severity of each AE and will record it on the source 
docum
ents and AE CRF, using the CTCAE v 3 grades  defined below. Events that are 
CTCAE grades 4 and 5 are serious events and require completion of both an SAE form and AE eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 251
 PAL-003 Page 57 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Grade Description 
1 Mild 
2 Moderate 
3 Severe 
4 Life threatening or debilitating 
5 Death related 
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarc tion); the event itself , however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome  or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or  functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulato ry reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the IP and will record it on the 
source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship Description 
Not Related Exposure to the IP has not occurred 
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  OR 
The AE is considered likely to be  related to an etiology other than 
the use of the IP; that is, there ar e no facts [evidence] or arguments 
to suggest a causal relationship to the IP. 
Possibly 
Related The administration of the IP a nd the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time 
AND 
The AE could be explained equall y well by [CONTACT_189459]. 
Probably 
Related The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time  
AND The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189460]. - protocol.pdf Page 252

Proprietary and Confidential 10.2 Serious Adverse Events 
A SAE is defined as any AE that: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life threatening, that is, pl aces the subject at immediate ri sk of death from the event 
as it occurred. This definition does not in clude a reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189315]-patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Admission of a subj ect to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189294]-p atient as a result of an 
AE, even if the subject is released on the same day, qualifies as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. An event qualifies as 
resulting in a persistent or  significant disability or incapacity if it involves a 
substantial disruption of th e subject’s ability to carry  out usual life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include e xperiences of relatively minor or temporary 
medical significance. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, that is , an AE that occurs in the child or fetus 
of a subject exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event that does not  meet any of the above criteria, but may 
jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensiv e treatment in the 
emergency room, allergic bronchospasm, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
More than one of the above criteria may apply to any specific event. 
The reporting period for SAEs begins earlier th an non-serious AEs and is the period from the 
time of signing of the ICF thr ough [ADDRESS_223636] atus or stabilization of the 
condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
Any SAE, whether or not cons idered related to study drug, will be reported immediately 
(within 24 hours) to BioMarin Pharmac ovigilance by [CONTACT_189462]-specific 
SAE Report 
Form. In addition to the outcome of the SAE, any medication or other 
therapeutic measures used to treat the event wi ll be recorded on the appropriate CRF page(s). 
Investigators should not wait to collect additional information that fully documents the event 
before notifying BioMarin Pharmacovigilance of an SAE. BioMarin may be required to - protocol.pdf Page 254
 PAL-003 Page 60 of 84 
 
Proprietary and Confidential report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities wi thin 7 calendar days of being notified about 
the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit additional information requested 
by [CONTACT_189463]. 
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory re quirements. Adequate 
documentation must be obtained by [CONTACT_189498].

The Investigator must make every effort to  follow the subject th rough resolution of the 
pregnancy (delivery or termina tion) and to report the resolu tion on the Pregnancy Follow-up 
Form in the study reference materials. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study 
subject, the Investigator should make ever y reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s

Proprietary and Confidential 14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorica l 
data will be summarized usi ng frequency and percent, while continuous data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, num ber of observations, mean, median, standard 
deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical 
analys
is. 
14.[ADDRESS_223658] postdose safety 
information  will 
be included in the safety analyses. 
Safety will be evaluated on the incidence of AEs, including serious AEs (SAEs), and 
clinically significant ch
anges in vita l signs and laboratory test results. 
The verbatim terms reported on CRFs to identify AEs will be c oded using MedDRA. 
Treatment-emergent AEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, 
relationship to study drug, and se verity. Changes from baseline in vital signs and laboratory 
test results will be summarized with descriptive statistics. 
14.[ADDRESS_223659] 2 weeks of the study will be included in the PK 
analysis. 
Steady-state PK (predose samples) of rAvPAL-PEG will be evaluated in PKU subjects after 
the subject has achieved and maintained  target blood Phe concentrations ( 120-600 μ mol/L) 
for a minimum of 2 weeks and no furt her dose modification is planned. 
Should data become available from PAL-002 that indicate study drug accumulation should 
also be measured, additional blood draws may be added  for PK analysis as needed but not 
to exceed 3x/w

Proprietary and Confidential 15 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC) 
The DMC will act independently  in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the safety 
of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects who participate in the study. Meetings of the DMC can be 
convened 
at any time at the discretion of the DMC Chair or the Study Medical Officer. 
The Chair will be notified by [CONTACT_189469]. The DMC will review the study data as soon as it 
is available during the study, on a schedule defined in the DMC Charter, and offer advice on 
whether or not to proceed, modify or termin ate study enrollment on the basis of toxicity. 
Details regarding the DMC membership and safety data to be reviewed by [CONTACT_189500] a charter. 
The responsibilities of the DMC are to: 
• Review the study protocol, informed cons ent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the tr ial, subjects’ risk versus be nefit, and other factors that 
could affect the study outcome. 
• Consider relevant 
information that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189316] 9.1.3. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223664]’s dise ase, that are not part of th is study. Costs associated with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed a nd collected in the way that such 
costs are usually billed and collected. 
The Investigator should contac t BioMarin immediately upon notification that a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_189501] e study. Any subject who 
experiences 
a study-related injury should be inst ructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre-specified medical institution if  possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subjec t should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance w ith, treatment for study-related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s 
instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531] , if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_44532]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin 
is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]-related inju ries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223665] be 
completed using a web–based applic ation that has been validated. Study site 
personnel will be trained
 on the application and will enter the clinical data from source 
documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CR F instructions, blank data fields are not 
acceptable. 
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will 
correct the value by [CONTACT_189502]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system 
will require the site 
personnel to enter a reason for changing the va lue. The documented a udit trail will include 
the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and 
the identity of the operator. BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifi able to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all origin al recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, 
all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subject s (or their legally authorized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when gi ving informed consent. If an Investigator or 
institution refuses to allow acce ss to subject records because of  confidentiality, arrangements 
must be made to allow an “inter view” style of data verification. 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189503] e CRFs with the original source documents 
at the 
study site and evaluate them for completeness and accuracy before designating them as 
“source data verified” (SDV). If an error is di scovered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_189477]. 
The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the response does not fully address the question. This proce ss is repeated until all 
open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, a ll data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electron ically s 
ign the casebook, specifying that the 
information on the CRFs is accurate and complete . The Data Manager, or designee, will then 
set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the - protocol.pdf Page 271

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY  
 
Amendment: 3  
Date: May 04, 2011 
 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The primary rationale for amending this protocol is to include a substudy to assess the safety, 
efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immune response when rAvPAL- PEG  treatment  is 
temporarily discontinued and then re -started  in subjects .  
rAvPAL -PEG is being assessed as a long -term, chronic treatment for patients with PKU, and 
there is limited safety, efficacy, PK, and immune  response information about the effects of a 
temporary dose interruption. Therefore, a Su bstudy has been added to this study to explore 
the effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -PEG treatment . In this Substudy, up to 
10 subjects will stop dosing for a period of approximately 4 weeks. During this dosing interruption, subjects will be asses sed for safety, efficacy,  PK, and immune response and will 
continue to perform the scheduled study assessments. Subjects are eligible for participation in the Substudy if they are on a stable rAvPAL-PEG dosing regimen (ie, blood Phe levels have been reached at 60 -600 µmol/L) for [ADDRESS_223676] not reported any serious 
adverse events (SAEs)  during this study, and were not enrolled in Study PAL-004.  
Currently, there is no information regarding the PK  profile  of rAvPAL-PEG when blood Phe 
levels are at 60 -600 µmol/L for subjects on a multiple -dose regimen. To address this lack of 
information, additional PK sampling will be performed prior to the dosing interruption. Upon restarting rAvPAL -PEG, PK sampling will also be performed to allow for c ollection of drug 
exposure data (area under the plasma concentration -time curve [AUC] and maximum plasma 
concentration [C
max]), absorption rate, and clearance for subjects who  have been previously 
exposed to rAvPAL- PEG  in this Substudy. This information will allow for comparisons to be 
performed with subjects who we re naïve to previous rAvPAL- PEG treatment from the Phase 
1 study, PAL-001. 
Following participation in the Substudy, subjects will return to the rAvPAL -PEG dose level 
and frequency that they were receiving prior to the dose interruption and will continue 
participation in the study until completion .  - protocol.pdf Page 281
 PAL -003 Page 3 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Because rAvPAL -PEG is a bacterial protein, an immune- mediated reaction  and a reduction 
in efficacy (blood Phe reductions) are possible when rAvPAL -PEG dosing is re-introduced 
after the dose interruption of the Substudy. However, information from nonclinical studies, 
antibody results, and safety  and efficacy  results from the clinical studies to date (JAN2011) 
have shown that there is  no added safety risk or ris k of decreased efficacy  when 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing is stopped and then re- started  at the same dose level .  
• In nonclinical  studies using the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model, an animal 
model that exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, a 2-4 week 
dose-interruption was  performed  in animals administered 80  mg/kg/week . Following 
the dose interruption assessment , the animals re-started  rAvPAL -PEG dosing at the 
same dose level (80 mg/kg /week ). In this assessment, n o safety issues were noted 
upon re- starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG and there was an immediate return to 
stable blood Phe reductions .  
• There has not been any  immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated reactions to 
rAvPAL -PEG observed  following administration of a rAvPAL-PEG injection. All 
reactions to rAvPAL -PEG have been reported approximately 12-[ADDRESS_223677] anaphylaxis or a severe 
systemic reaction. Thus, it is not anticipated that reactions to rAvPAL- PEG are 
IgE-mediated .   
• To date (JAN2011), the clinical experience with re-starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing for 
subjects from Study PAL -[ADDRESS_223678] on reducing blood Phe levels upon re-introduction of drug.  
• Nine subjects who received a single dose of rAvPAL -PEG and completed  the Phase 1 
study,  PAL -001, rolled over into the multiple -dose, Phase 2 study, PAL -002. After a 
period of several months during which no drug was administered, these 9  subjects re-
started rAvPAL -PEG dosing in Study PAL-002 at the same starting doses as was 
administered in Study PAL-001. T here has been no difference to date in the safety 
profile  or efficacy  profile  of the subjects from Study PAL -001 who rolled over into 
Study PAL -002 (previously exposed to rAvPAL- PEG) when compared with subjects 
who were  naive to rAvPAL-PEG dosing in Study PAL-002. Although previously 
exposed subjects had higher and a faster return of anti-PAL and anti- PEG 
immunoglobulin G ( IgG) titers than those of naïve subjects, these results have  not 
been associated with a higher safety risk  or efficacy risk based on information to date.  
o In Study PAL-002, [ADDRESS_223679] had a protocol -defined (per 
Protocol Amendment # 3 dated 30APR2010), 2-week washout (no dose - protocol.pdf Page 282
 PAL -003 Page 4 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 administered) following several weeks of a fixed dose of 0.06 mg/kg/week or 
0.1 mg/kg/week  rAvPAL -PEG. Following the [ADDRESS_223680] experienced additional safety issues. Eight subjects continue to receive dosing with rAvPAL-PEG (APR 2011) and have subsequently increas ed their dose level without additional reported adverse events that have 
resulted in a subsequent dosing interruption
. 
 
In summary, because the risk to subject safety  and efficacy  is expected to be limited upon re-
starting rAvPAL -PEG, dosing will be re- started at the same dose level for subjects in the 
Substudy. Re- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing must be pe rformed in the clinic with 
post-administration observation performed to monitor subject safety. In addition, subjects will continue to be assessed per the safety assessment and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189330]. Dose decreases for safety and increases  also will continue to be performed relative 
to safety as defined in the protocol.  In addition, t he Substudy objectives have been added  to 
assess the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing on safety and tolerability, 
efficacy (blood Phe concentration), PK, and immune response. The PK analysis has also been 
revised to accommodate for inclusion of the Substudy
. 
Additional major  changes implemented in this protocol amendment are as follows: - protocol.pdf Page 283
 PAL -003 Page 5 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 • The maximum allowable rAvPAL -PEG dose of 2.0 mg/kg/week has been increased 
to 5.0 mg/kg/week to allow for further dose increases. This change is based on 
available safety and blood Phe information to date (JAN2011) from this ongoing study and from the ongoing Phase 2 study, PAL-002. Experience from this study and Study PAL -002to date (JAN2011) indicates that rAvPAL-PEG administered in doses 
titrated up to a single administration of 2.0 mg/kg/week does not pose a clinically 
significant risk to subject safety. The most frequently reported AEs in this study and Study PAL -[ADDRESS_223681] been self -limited and without sequelae. One 
SAE (dehydration and urticaria) has been reported to date; the event was reported as not related to treatment with rAvPAL -PEG and resolved. Two days after dosing with 
rAvPAL -PEG, the subject presented with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_151412].  The 
subject was started on  for the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].  Twenty -four hours 
 after starting  and the third day after dosing with rAvPAL -PEG at 0.1mg/kg, 
the subject pr esented with a generalized skin reaction (urticaria).  Because the subject 
had no improvement while on ,  went to the emergency room and was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189331].  Since this event , this subject has remained in the study and and has 
continued dosing with rAvPAL-PEG, escalating the dose to 0.6 mg/kg with no additional events reported to date. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_189332] -PEG being well tolerated in doses 
up to 2.0 mg/kg/week, many of the subjects  in Study PAL-[ADDRESS_223682] not yet been able 
to achieve and sustain blood Phe reductions to clinically significant levels (120-600 µmol/L; JAN2011). While some subjects who have been administered 2.0 mg/kg/week rAvPAL -PEG have had > 50% reduction from baseline in blood Phe 
levels, they have not yet achieved the protocol-defined target blood Phe of 120-600 
µmol/L (JAN2011). It is hypothesized that administration of rAvPAL-PEG doses 
higher than 2.0 mg/kg/week will reduce the blood Phe levels further to within the protocol- defined range of clinical significance (60 -600 µmol/L; target range revised 
per this protocol amendment) without jeopardizing subject safety. Dose increases up to 5.0 mg/kg/week may be implemented if none of the protocol-defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189333]. Increases to 5.0  mg/kg/week must be performed in increments, 
every 2 weeks, per the dose increase instructions and safety assessment and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189334]. U pwards titration of dose to 5.0 mg/kg/week will be 
gradual t o mitigate risk to subject safety. Also, subjects who increase dosing to up to 
5.0 mg/kg/week will continue to be monitored for safety, blood Phe, PK, and antibodies per the scheduled assessments and procedures. - protocol.pdf Page 284

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 • The study inclusion criteria have been modified to permit subjects who have 
completed Study PAL-004 (A Phase 2, Open- Label Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Dose Levels of rAvPAL- PEG 
Administered Daily in Subjects with Phenylketonuria ) to continue to receive 
rAvPAL-PEG in this study. Additionally, instruction regarding re-introduction of 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing has been added for subjects rolling over from Study PAL-004. 
rAvPAL -PEG treatment will be re -introduced at the same dose level and dosing 
frequency  as was admi nistered at the completion of Study PAL-004. Subjects will be 
monitored for safety when rAvPAL-PEG dosing is re-started in this study, and 
subjects will continue to be assessed per the safety assessment and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189330].  
• The target blood Phe level has been revised from 120-600 µmol/L to 60 -600 µmol/L 
to allow for dosing that may provide greater clinical benefit to subjects. Blood Phe 
levels of approximately 60  ± 13 µmol/L are considered normal per the NIH 
Consensus Statement, 2000. 
• An exploratory objective has been added to assess the relationship of diet and change 
in blood Phe level in subjects with PKU. Information from a 3- day diet diary will be 
used to assess dietary Phe intake, as well as  all other liquids and food. The study 
rationale has been revised to include information regarding the relationship of diet in blood Phe concentration following administration of rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with 
PKU. The study rationale and  study outcome measur es have also been revised to 
address this added study objective.  
• Information regarding self administration of rAvPAL- PEG  has been added. 
Self-administration of study drug is now allowed by [CONTACT_189553] r and the Sponsor’s Medical Of ficer and if adequate 
training is demonstrated. This change has been  made to increase subject participation 
and to increase study completion  given the long study duration.

o An optional skin biopsy of the affected and not affected area has been 
added to the Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit for subjects who have had a systemic reaction or a large local reaction not contiguous to the injection site. The biopsy is optional per subject consent and should be taken within 1 week of the reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3, Section 
12.3.7, and  Table 2.1.1) . The biopsy will allow for further monitoring of 
subject safet
y. 
12. To monitor for subject safety, assessments have bee n added for subjects who have 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing administered outside of a scheduled clinic visit, including 
subjects who are on a daily dosing regimen. AEs, concomitant medications, and an inspection of the injection site will be assessed (refer to Section  12 and Table 2.1.1) .  
13. The safety assessments performed during the Unscheduled Hypersensi tivity Reaction 
visit are now mandatory for subjects who have a systemic reaction or a large local reaction that is not contiguous with the injection site.  This revision has been made to

visits are not required to be performed in the clinic if performed by a home healthcare 
professional. This change will allow for increased subject compliance (refer to 
Section  12 and Table 2.1.1).  
17. The duration of the study has been extended from 24 months to up to 60 months to allow for extended collection of long-term safety information from subjects who are administered rAvPAL- PEG (refer to the Sy nopsis [ Section  2] and Section  9.1). 
18. The PK assessments have been removed from the Interim Dosing Visit for subjects 
who increase their dose frequency (refer to Section  12and  Table 2.1.3and  Table 2.1.4)  
because PK information will now be obtained from the Substudy. 
19. Information regarding the timing of dose administration and sampling for PK and blood Phe has been revised; dose administration and sampling no longer need to be performed in the morning but must be performed prior to dose administration. This change has been made to allow for feasibility of dosing for both sites and subjects (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Section  [IP_ADDRESS], and Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
20. Results from the completed Phase [ADDRESS_223696] been added (Section  7.2.1). Information regarding Phase 2 Study PAL-002 has been updated and 
information regarding Phase 2 Study PAL-004 has been added to the Background section (refer to Section  7.2).

TITLE OF STUDY:  
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open- Label Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL -PEG in Subjects with PKU  
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL -003 
STUDY SITES:  Approximately 20  centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE:  
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) 
is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have 
additional clinical benefits. This study is an extension of the dose-finding studies (Study PAL-002 and 
Study PAL -004). Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whether long- term 
dosing of rAvPAL -PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects.  
Because rAvPAL -PEG is being assessed as a long -term chronic treatment for patients with PKU, there 
is a need to understand the effect of a temporary dosing interruption on the safety, efficacy (blood Phe), PK, and immune  response. Therefore, a Substudy has been a dded to this study to assess the 
effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -PEG treatment in subjects who are on a variety of 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing regimens (dose level and frequency). Up to 10 subjects who are on a variety of 
dosing regimens (dose level and frequency) in this study are eligible for participation in the Substudy and will stop dosing for a period of approximately [ADDRESS_223699]:

been added to this study to assess the relationship  of diet, rAvPAL -PEG administration, and blood Phe 
level. Changes to subject diet are not allowed in this study unless per the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. Diet  will be monitored using a diet diary. 
OBJECTIVES:  
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long -term administration of multiple doses of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the immune response to long- term administration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To assess the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration following 
administration with rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows: 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing in a 
subset of subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing on blood Phe

STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN:  
This is a long -term extension of the Phase 2, open -label, dose-finding studies, PAL -002 and PAL-004, 
in approximately 100 subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested 
in PAL -002 and PAL-004 (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week), provided no dose- limiting 
toxicity is observed in PAL-[ADDRESS_223701] be 
made per t he Investigator  in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer and must be performed 
under the supervision of the Investigaor in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. To 
monitor for changes in sub ject diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be 
reviewed with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189556]’s 
Medical Officer and if adequate trainin g is demonstrat ed. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be 
considered appropriate for self administration.    
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
version  4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Spons or. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take

PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or mai ntain blood Phe 
concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range (60 -600 µmol/L), the subject may 
be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
A subject will continu e in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator.  
3.  The subject has completed the study through the Month 60 visit . 
4.  The study is terminated.  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from 
study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to 
have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued p articipation does not 
compromise subject safety.  
PAL -[ADDRESS_223703] rAvPAL -PEG administration halted for approximately 4 weeks 
regar dless of their dosing regimen (dose level and frequency). rAvPAL -PEG will not be administered 
during the dose interruption; however, subjects will continue to perform assessments for safety, blood 
Phe concentration, PK, and immune response. Subjects enroll ed into the Substudy will also have  
additional PK sampling performed prior to the  dosing interruption  and during the dosing interruption. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223704]:

Dose Modifications : 
Dose Increase Methodology
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator, in agreement with the 
Study Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event 
profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations.  : 
 
For sub jects from PAL -[ADDRESS_223706]’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_223707]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per 
a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentration s. Dose increases should be performed  as 
follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose.  
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, and 5.0 mg/kg)) or per 
Investigator determination in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer based on 
available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any 
adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189557] a total weekly dose 
not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg.Subjects who increase their dose frequency will have additional 
assessmen ts performed (Interim Dosing Visit). 
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_223708]:

first modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not 
need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount.  
• Only 1 dose (level or frequency) adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks.  
• Blood Phe levels will be measured daily for 3 days after each dose increase (fingerstick is acceptable); more frequent or daily blood Phe measurements may be performed. 
 Dose Decrease Methodology  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical Officer. 
Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a subject’s blood 
Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie,   any adverse event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose).  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 
0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required to attain  the target Phe concentration, dosing 
frequency may be reduced.  
Safety Assessment  Criteria
If an individual subject exhibits toxicity of a treatment- emergent CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_223709]’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_079] (PI) 
and the Study Medical Officer, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject 
from the study treatment, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level.  : 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
If 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit toxicity of a treatment -emergent CTCAE grade 3 or greater 
or a systemic reaction that is assessed as related to treatment with study drug, further dosing of 
subjects at that dose level will be evaluated  and  a safety assessment will be  completed. In addition, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may  be notified of this occurrence if appropriate. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223710]:

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) is contained in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator 
should review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program for rAvPAL- PEG has characterized the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG using the inte nded clinical SC route 
of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of 
PKU. The ENU2 mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, 
including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) 
and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL- PEG administered to male 
ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximately 2000  µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week  3 and Week 7 of dosing. After 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL- PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned as evidenced by [CONTACT_189563] < 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 weeks.  
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG -PAL, two dose interruption ass essments were performed:  a 
2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose interru ption assessments, the animals re -started rAvPAL -PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL- PEG injections were temporarily 
stopped for 2 -4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A 
similar interim attenuated response was observed with the  longer dose interruption of 
approximately 11 weeks .  In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG (Lapis, 2007, ASHG 57th Annual Meeting) . 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) effects were seen wit h SC administration of 
rAvPAL -PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were observed in telemetry -instrumented monkeys assessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL -PEG administered subcutaneously. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half -life (t
1/2) values of rAvPAL- PEG administered to 
normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_223740] area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) -dose. In the 
cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the t 1/2 was 65  hours at 
4.0 mg/kg, 71  hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest 
dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have 
similar characteristics. The following findings were noted: (1)  a 1-compartment model with 
first-order absorption appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL- PEG after 
single -dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after 
SC administration to maximum observed plasma concentra tion (C max), along with a long t 1/2, 
(3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) the AUC and the C
max are roughly linearly proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG was assessed in single -dose and repe at-dose studies in normal 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose rat study, decreased body weight gain and Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the Kupffer cell finding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a 26-week repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and vacuolation of the histiocytic cells were observed in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. In a 39 -week repeat -dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid nodules in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this finding was completely reversed after [ADDRESS_223741] -level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL -PEG when administered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells in the rat and arterial inflammation findings in the monkey.  - protocol.pdf Page 322

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU patients 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan® or are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  
This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG 
(Study  PAL -002 and Study PAL-004) based on data from the completed clinical study, 
PAL -001, and clinical experience to date (JAN2011) from this ongoing study and the other 
ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_223742] of rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe concentrations. 
The effectiveness of rAvPAL -PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies of 
ENU2 mice was consistent with what was observed in PAL-001. PAL-001 enrolled 25 PKU 
subjects with a mean (standard deviation; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolled into the study were assigned to receive a single administration of rAvPAL -PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects e ach received 1  of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL- PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL -001 are summarized as follows: 
• rAvPAL -PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood -lowering 
effect on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  
• For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL- PEG, clinically 
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically 
significant decreases from baseline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3% (mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was 1113 µmol/L.  
• Overall, no clinically significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed in 
subjects who were administered rAvPAL -PEG at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003, 
0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg. - protocol.pdf Page 323
 PAL -003 Page 45 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 • For subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG at the 3  higher dose levels (0.01, 
0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL-PEG concentration levels, the 
calculated PK parameters were a mean T max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/2 of 46-120 hours, 
and an AUC 0-t, and C max that were proportional with dose. Drug exposure was slightly 
increased with increased dose.  
 
7.2.2 Phase 2 Studies PAL -002 and PAL-004 
Currently, rAvPAL -PEG is being investigated in two Phase 2 clinical trials (PAL -002 and 
PAL -004). To date (JAN2011), a total of [ADDRESS_223743] for Study 
PAL -004.   
In PAL -002 (A Phase 2, Open- Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety , Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU), 
approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled and will be administered multiple doses of rAvPAL -PEG up to 5.0 mg/kg/week. PAL-002 is a 2-part study. In Part 1, subjects will be 
assigned to 1 of 4 rAvPAL-PEG dose cohorts (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg). rAvPAL -PEG will be administered at a fixed weekly dose of 0.001 mg/kg (Cohort 1), 
0.003 mg/kg (Cohort 2), 0.01 mg/kg (Cohort 3), 1.0 mg/kg (Cohort 4), or 0.1 mg/kg (Part  1 
Substudy) for 8 weeks. In Part 2, all subjects who complete Part 1 will be administered an adjustable dose of rAvPAL-PEG for up to an additional 8 weeks. The dose administered in Part 2 may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189564]/or dose frequency to reach a target blood Phe 
concentration of 60-600 µmol/L. Study PAL -003 (Long-Term Extension of a Phase 2, Open-
Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL- PEG in Subjects with PKU) is an extension study of PAL-
[ADDRESS_223744] of multiple doses of rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU for up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary 
objectives of the study are (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of 
multiple dose levels of rAvPAL-PEG, (2) to evaluate the antibody response to rAvPAL- PEG, 
and (3) to evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. The study protocol 
was amended ( 30APR2010) to include a substudy of an additional rAvPAL- PEG dose level - protocol.pdf Page 324
 PAL -003 Page 46 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 (0.1 mg/kg/week) that reduced blood Phe concentrations to clinically significant levels in the 
Phase 1 study, PAL-001. The protocol was amended again (28MAR2011) to increase the starting dose for Cohort 4 from 0.03 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week. To date (JAN2011), [ADDRESS_223745] been dosed with 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG. Additional information about the safety reported to date 
(JAN2011) is provided in Section  7.4.2. 
Study PAL -004 is designed to determine if daily administration of rAvPAL- PEG at  daily 
dose levels (0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day) is safe and effective in reducing and maintaining consistent blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. It is hypothesized that a higher starting dose and frequency will reduce blood Phe concentrations to near- normal 
levels in  a timely manner and will provide the greatest clinical benefit. Considering the 
concentration and volume of drug that is administered subcutaneously, the only way to increase the rAvPAL -PEG dose is via daily administration. Therefore, in Study PAL- 004, a 
higher starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg will be administered 5 days a week (referred to as daily), a dosing regimen that has been observed to be tolerated and to reduce blood Phe concentrations to clinically meaningful levels in previously exposed subjects in this study. Following completion of Study PAL-004, subjects have the option to enroll into this study and to continue to receive doses of rAvPAL-PEG for up to an additional 60 months. 
In this study, subjects in PAL-002 and PAL-004 will continue to be adminis tered the same 
rAvPAL -PEG that was administered in PAL -002 or PAL-004. If the safety, PK, and blood 
Phe concentration results from either PAL-002 or PAL-004 indicate that the appropriate level 
of PEGylation and dosing regimen differs from that administered  in PAL-002 or PAL-004, 
the PEGylation and/or dosing regimen administered in this study may change.    
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited disease characterized by [CONTACT_189448]. Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North America is born with PKU (Scriver,  
2001, McGraw- Hill) . Left untreated, PAH deficiency is associated with an abnormally 
elevated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to the brain ( Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr .) and can 
result in a variety of neuropathologic conditions, including mental retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities (Scriver, 2001, McGraw- Hill) . The 
brains of untreated patients with PKU show evidence of hypomyelination and gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, and, in some ca ses, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, 
Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated Phe during fetal development leads to severe mental retardation and 
can cause microcephaly, growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, - protocol.pdf Page 325
 PAL -003 Page 47 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Pediatrics ), (Koch, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Lee, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics ), 
(Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr .). 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of PKU involves adherence to low- Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containing foods. Implementation of a 
Phe-restricted diet in infancy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents many of the neuropathologic manifestations of PKU, including severe mental retardation. However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of natural protein sources ( Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), ( Walter, 2002, Lancet ). 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with PKU safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. rAvPAL -PEG is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may ha ve additional clinical benefits.  
Because rAvPAL -PEG is being assessed as a long -term chronic treatment for patients with 
PKU, there is a need to understand the effect of a temporary dosing interruption on the safety,  efficacy (blood Phe), PK, and immune response. To date (JAN2011), there is limited  
information on the effects of a rAvPAL -PEG dose interruption in subjects with PKU. 
Therefore, a Substudy has been added to this study to assess the effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]-starting rAvPAL -PEG treatment in sub jects who are on a variety of rAvPAL -PEG dosing 
regimens (dose level and frequency). Up to 10 subjects who are on a variety of dosing regimens (dose level and frequency) in this study are eligible for participation in the Substudy and will stop dosing for a period of approximately 4 weeks. During this dosing interruption, subjects will be assessed for safety, efficacy, PK, and immune response and will continue to perform the scheduled study assessments. There is no information regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rAvPAL -PEG when blood Phe levels are at 60-600 µmol/L 
for subjects on a multiple-dose regimen. To address this lack of information, additional PK sampling will be performed prior to the dosing interruption. Upon restarting rAvPAL- PEG, 
PK sa mpling will also be performed to allow for collection of drug exposure data (area under 
the plasma concentration -time curve [AUC] and maximum plasma concentration [C
max]), 
absorption rate, and clearance for subjects who have been previously exposed to rAvPAL-PEG in this Substudy. This information will allow for comparisons to be performed with - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223746] diet are not allowed in 
this study unless per the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.     
This study is an extension of the dose- finding studies (PAL -002 and PAL-004). 
Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whether long-term dosing of rAvPAL -PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from PAL-002 or PAL- 004 will change the assumption that rAvPAL -PEG 
has a toxicity profile similar to other reco mbinant PEGylated non-human enzymes currently in use. 
The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and 
toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects result ing 
in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that could occur with rAvPAL -PEG include injection- site reactions and other general symptoms.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_223747] been a few 
reports of PEG -related AEs in humans; cumulative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, oliguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely used medicines and other compounds that are administered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_123001] ( Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos .). No indication of PEG- related toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been assocated with PEG -related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins 
(refer to Section  7.1).  
In this study, subjects will be monitored closely with urine examinations and blood chemistries to follow kidney function. - protocol.pdf Page 327
 PAL -003 Page 49 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 7.4.2 Toxicity Due to an Immunologic Reaction 
The active drug substance in rAvPAL- PEG is a bacterial protein, and as such, it is expected 
that it may elicit immune recognition and responses. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the  immune 
response may be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab ). In vivo 
and in vitro experiments have shown that PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the 
immunological response (Scott, 1997, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A ), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs .). 
PEGylation has been effective in reducing anti-rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model, although PEGylation does not eliminate antibody formation. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL may have a significant effect on reducing the immunogenicity of the molecule, it is reasonable to expect that some individuals may exhibit immune responses upon exposure to the drug. These immune responses may be clinically irrelevant, cause symptoms of various 
degrees, or lead to neutralization of biological activity. Subjects participating in clinical trials will be monitored closely with specific antibody titers, sedimentation rates, and complete blood counts (CBCs). 
In Study PAL-001, there were 11 subjects (out of 25 subjects in the study) with skin- related 
reactions (injection -site bruising, erythema, pain, rash, swelling, and urticaria) that occurred 
following the single a dministration of rAvPAL-PEG. For all of these subjects, the reactions 
were generalized skin reactions or injection -site skin reactions that did not compromise other 
organs and were not life-threatening. These suspected antibody- mediated responses were 
nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. These subjects are not considered to be at 
significant risk for antibody -mediated reactions with injection of rAvPAL-PEG during 
PAL -002, PAL-004, or this study; however, specific precautions for these subjects will be 
taken during this study to monitor subject safety (refer to Section  9.1.1).  
In Study PAL-002, [ADDRESS_223748] been dosed to date (JAN2011), including at dose le vels 
of 2.0 mg/kg/week (or 0.4 mg/kg/5 days a week). Most reactions reported in these subjects have been nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. There has been 1 SAE reported to date; the event was reported as not related to treatment with study drug.  There have been no 
reports of anaphylaxis to date (JAN2011). Subjects who have a systemic reaction during this study will undergo a series of assessments to monitor safety, including assessment of IgE antibodies, prior to determining if dosing may resume . Additionally, subjects who have 
systemic reactions will be premedicated and will be monitored closely for safety (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3 for additional information regarding continued treatment of subjects with 
systemic reactions during the study).  - protocol.pdf Page 328

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic ( Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol .), (Harris, 2003, 
Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), however, antibodies against PEG may form when PEG is bound to 
compounds. (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.) ,(Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.).  In some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in any significant clinical effects in humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . 
In some individuals, anti-PEG antibodies may be pre-existing due to previous exposure to 
PEG in other products. Anti-PEG antibodies have been associated with nonresponsiveness against therapy (Armstr ong, 2007, Cancer ), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther. ) 
Administration of rAvPAL- PEG may lead to anti -PEG antibody formation, and the duration 
of this possible effect is not known. This 
may limit a subject’s future ability to be treated 
with other PEG-containing ( eg, Depo -Provera) or PEGylated (eg,  PEG -interferon) injectable 
drugs. It is therefore recommended that any PEG -containing injectable drug administered to 
subjects after completion of this study be done under medical observation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Skin Reactions  
Two out of 25 subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL- 001 and received the 
protocol-defined single dose of rAvPAL- PEG reported systemic skin reactions (generalized 
skin rash) that were attributed to treatment with study drug. One subject received a single dose of 0.001 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG, and the other subject received a single dose of 
0.01 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG. One of these events was reported as serious, and the other was 
reported as nonserious; both events were reported following administration of Depo- Provera 
injections (medroxyprogesterone injection), an injectable contraception. These allergic 
reactions are thought to be related to the PEG molecules that are found in both the study drug, rAvPAL -PEG, and Depo-Provera. These reactions are not likely to be experie nced 
concurrent with other birth control medications. 
The [ADDRESS_223749]; however, no further reactions or complications were reported following subsequent administration of a full dose of Depo-Provera. Upon study completion, the subject continued to receive regular doses (every 3 months) of Depo-Provera, and no further reactions were reported. The second - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223750]’s symptoms resolved within [ADDRESS_223751] basis for these reported events and their duration is not known, the use of PEG-containing injectable drugs prior to, during, and after this study is prohibited as a precautionary measure (ref er to Section  9.3.2 and Section 9.4.8. ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Allergic Reactions 
Allergic reactions to the SC injection of rAvPAL- PEG may be mild, moderate , or severe in 
intensity. Reactions may include pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or anaphylaxis. Clinical assessments should be conducted for a minimum of 30-[ADDRESS_223752]-injection. Longer observations may be required at the discretion of the PI. The responsible physician should use all appropriate measures for the treatment of allergic 
reactions. Because of the small potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be within easy access during and after the 
rAvPAL -PEG injection. Subjects who qualify for self administration of study drug will be 
provided with emergency resuscitation instructions (refer to Section  9.[ADDRESS_223753] 
Self-Administration Training Materials ). 
In the event of an allergic reaction, subjects may be asked to see an allergist/immunologist and/or provide up to [ADDRESS_223754] es for antibody testing. This additional testing 
may occur up to 6 months following the final study visit. 
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of allergic symptoms:  - protocol.pdf Page 330

 PAL -003 Page 52 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 • Maintain the airway.  
• Vital sign check.  
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment.  
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center.  
In addition, clinical judgment must be used in determining the appropriateness of 
corticosteroid administration. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (5-10 mg/kg) may also be administered. An allergy and/or immunology consultation should be sought if necessary. Information regarding the management of local skin, large local skin, and systemic reactions is provided in Section  9.1.1. Detailed instructions for the management of allergic reactions 
are provided in the Study Reference Manual.  
7.4.3 Effects of Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189344] -Starting rAvPAL -PEG Treatment  
The effects  of starting, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and re- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing on safety and blood 
Phe reductions previously achieved through rAvPAL-PEG dosing are not well defin ed, and 
there is limited clinical experience with rAvPAL -PEG. Allergic reactions are a common and 
expected clinical outcome of re -starting biologic drugs, such as rAvPAL-PEG, and may 
occur when subjects re- start rAvPAL -PEG dosing. However, no information reported from 
the ongoing clinical studies, including this study, or nonclinical results point to an increased safety risk  or decreased  efficacywhen rAvPAL-PEG dosing is stopped and then re- started at 
the same dose level . 
• Nonclinical experience in the BTBR Pah
enu2 (ENU2) mouse model indicates that 
dosing interruptions of 2- 4 weeks  for mice administered rAvPAL -PEG 
80 mg/kg/week had no increased safety risk upon re- starting dosing and there was an 
immediate  return to stable blood Phe reductions (refer to  Section  7.1).  - protocol.pdf Page 331
 PAL -003 Page 53 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 • Antibody results from the ongoing Phase 2 study, PAL-002, and this ongoing study to 
date (JAN2011) have not indicated an immune  response that points to an increased 
safety risk or decreased efficacy  upon re-introduction of drug. There has  not been any 
immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated reactions to rAvPAL-PEG observed 
following administration of a rAvPAL- PEG injection. All reactions to rAvPAL -PEG 
have been reported approximately 12-[ADDRESS_223755] anaphylaxis or a severe systemic reaction. Thus, it is not anticipated that reactions to rAvPAL -PEG are IgE -mediated.   
• To date (JAN2011), the clinical experience with re- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing for 
subjects from Study PAL-[ADDRESS_223756] on reducing blood Phe levels upon 
re-introduction of drug.  
o Nine subjects who received a single dose of rAvPAL-PEG and completed the 
Phase 1 study, PAL-001, rolled over into the multiple-dose, Phase 2 study, PAL -002. After a period of several months during which no drug was 
administered, these 9  subjects re- started rAvPAL -PEG dosing in Study PAL-
002 at the same starting doses as was
 administered in Study PAL -001. There 
has been no difference to date in the safety profile or efficacy p rofile  of the 
subjects from Study PAL-001 who rolled over into Study PAL-002 (previously exposed to rAvPAL-PEG) when compared with subjects who were naive to rAvPAL -PEG dosing in Study PAL-002. Although previously 
exposed subjects had higher and a faster return of anti-PAL and anti- PEG IgG 
titers than those of naïve subjects, these results have not been associated with a higher safety risk or efficacy riskbased on information to date.  
o In Study PAL-002, [ADDRESS_223757] had a protocol -defined (per 
Protocol Amendment # 3 dated 30APR2010), 2-week washout (no dose administered) following several weeks of a fixed dose of 0.06 mg/kg/week or 0.1 mg/kg/week rAvPAL -PEG. Following the [ADDRESS_223758] experienced additional safety issues. Eight subjects continue to receive dosing with rAvPAL-PEG (APR 2011) and have subsequently increased their dose level without additional reported adverse events that have resulted in a subsequent dosing interruption. 
In this study, measures will be taken to reduce the risk to subject safety upon re- starting 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing while still allowing for reductions in blood Phe level to clinical 
signific ance (blood Phe reduction to 60-600 µmol/L) . To mitigate the possible safety risks 
upon re- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing, re-introduction of dosing should be performed in the 
clinic , and the subject must be observed for 30- [ADDRESS_223759] safety. S ubjects will also continue to be assessed per 
the safety assessment and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189345] n 9.1.3 and Section  9.1.4, and 
dose decreases will continue to be performed relative to safety as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
To mitigate the possible reduced effect on blood Phe level upon re- starting rAvPAL -PEG, 
subjects in this study who interrupt dosing whether per the protocol (ie, subjects participating in the Substudy; refer to Section  9.1) or for other reasons (refer to Section  9.4.10) will 
re-start rAvPAL -PEG dosing at the same dose level.  - protocol.pdf Page 333

9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long- term extension of the Phase 2, open-label, dose-finding studies, PAL-002 and 
PAL -004, in approximately 10 0 subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same 
range as those tested in PAL -002 and PAL-004 (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week), 
provided no dose- limiting tox icity was observed in PAL-[ADDRESS_223760] be made per the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer 
and must be performed under the supervision of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Of ficer. To monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet diary will be issued 
to subjects for completion and will be brought to each clinic visit for review with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_81920]’s Medical Officer and if adequate training is demonstrated . Subjects must meet a set 
of criteria to be considered appropriate for self administration. Refer to Section  9.[ADDRESS_223761] Self -Administration Training Materials . 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured 
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. - protocol.pdf Page 335
 PAL -003 Page 57 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of 
subjects in the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. PAL -002 and PAL-004 subjects’ rAvPAL- PEG do sing will continue in PAL -
003. In PAL-003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or maintain blood 
Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 2.1.1, Table 2.1.2, Table 2.1.3 and Table 2.1.4 (Schedule of Events) . After the 
subject’s blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range 
(60-600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood 
Phe concentration analyses as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Offic er. 
A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3. The subject has completed the study through the Month 60 visit.  
4. The study is terminated.  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data 
affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety. 
A subset of up to [ADDRESS_223762] rAvPAL -PEG administration halted for approximately 4 weeks regardless of their dosing 
regimen (dose level and frequency). rAvPAL-PEG will not be administered during the dose - protocol.pdf Page 336

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 [IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Hypersensitivity Reactions to rAvPAL -PEG Administered 
Subcutaneously  
During Study PAL-003, subjects may experience hypersensitivity reactions to rAvPAL- PEG. 
The hypersensitivity reactions are defined as follows:  
Local skin reaction: 
• Skin signs or symptoms in 1 affected primary location, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling 
or an area of erythema,  redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site of 
injection.  
• Large local skin reaction: 
• Skin signs or symptoms, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, 
redness, or induration with pain or itching that extends beyond the site of injection by [CONTACT_3450] 6 inches (15 cm) and/or signs or symptoms that are not contiguous to the injection site. These may be associated with a low risk of systemic symptoms or anaphylaxis upon re- exposure and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction 
when not contiguous to the injection site. 
• Systemic reaction (including generalized skin symptoms): 
• Skin and non-skin signs or symptoms in more than 1 affected primary location, 
ie, cutaneous reaction in more than 1 area and/or anaphylaxis or any ot her generalized 
symptoms, such as hypotension, angioedema or the involvement of other organ 
systems, eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological; and/or a fever attributed to treatment with rAvPAL -PEG (  ≥ 100.4°F or  ≥ 38°C).

administration of rAvPAL-PEG in this study may continue if the symptoms do not worsen 
and no other symptoms have developed but may be premedicated with acetaminophen and/or antihistamines (standard dosage per the package insert ) [ADDRESS_223767] is accompanied by a designated driver.  
Symptoms of local reactions may be treated with local application of ice and non- sedating 
oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_189327]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If the local skin reaction worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_189565]) even with premedication prior to study drug 
dosing, the subject must be withdrawn from study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Large Local Skin Reactions 
Large local skin reactions (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition) may or may not be 
contiguous to the rAvPAL- PEG injection site, and subjects with either type of large local 
skin reaction may continue dosing if the skin symptoms have resolved and no other 
symptoms ha ve developed. Subjects may be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Systemic Reactions  
Subjects who experience a systemic reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for a definition) after 
administration of rAvPAL- PEG must s top further administrations of rAvPAL-PEG and must 
immediately return to the clinic for safety assessments  . Subjects who experience generalized 
skin symptoms are included in this category. Immediately after the systemic reaction (within 48 hours), subject s with generalized skin symptoms must have additional assessments 
performed for safety (ie, Unscheduled Hypersens itivity Reaction Visit): serum antibodies 
(anti--PAL IgG, anti -PAL IgM, anti -PEG IgG, anti -PEG IgM, anti rAvPAL -PEG IgE, 
anti-rAvPAL -PEG neutra lizing antibodies); serum tryptase level (it is recommended that this 
sample be drawn immediately after reaction); sedimentation rate; CRP, CH50, C
1, C3, and 
C4; skin biopsy (optional; affected and not affected area; to be performed within 1 week of 
reacti on); and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology; refer to  
Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1).  
Following completion of the Unscheduled Systemic Reaction Visit, administration of rAvPAL -PEG may resume up to [ADDRESS_223771]’s safety will not be further compromised with resumed dosing. rAvPAL- PEG administration will resume at the next lowest dose level. 
Restarting of rAvPAL -PEG administration following a systemic reaction must be performed 
in the clinic for the first week of resumed dosing. Subjects must be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and /or antihistamines (standard dosage per the package insert ) [ADDRESS_223772] be accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).  
If blood Phe concentrations are not 60-600 µmol/L follo wing 1  week of daily administration 
at the lowered dose cohort and there is no fu rther evidence of toxicity (ie,  another systemic 
reaction attributed to rAvPAL -PEG administration or clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test results), the  subject may be administered the next highest dose level in the 
clinic per the allowable dose increases outlined in Section  9.1.2. Subjects must be - protocol.pdf Page 341

9.1.2 Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology  
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator, in agr eement 
with the Study Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations. 
For subjects from PAL-002, an individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day 
[ADDRESS_223774]’s dose may be adjusted if 
warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189491] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 
0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,  1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, a nd 5.0 mg/kg)  
or per Investigator determination in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg.Subjects who increase their dose frequency should perform the Interim Dosing Visit assessments (refer to Section  
12.3.6 and Table 2.1.3 
and Table 2.1.4).  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for 30-[ADDRESS_223775] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount. 
• Only 1 dose (level or frequency) adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. 
• Blood Phe levels will be measured daily for 3 days after each dose increase 
(fingerstick is acceptable); more frequent or daily blood Phe measurements may be 
performed.  - protocol.pdf Page 342
 PAL -003 Page 64 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology  
All do se decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical 
Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a 
subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse event (any hypersensi tivity 
reaction as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie,  any adverse 
event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose). 
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 
0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adj ustments are required to attain the target Phe 
concentration, dosing frequency may be reduced.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_223776]’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_189566] (PI) and the Study Medical Officer, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from the study treatment, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level. 
9.1.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_42224] 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit toxicity of a treatment- emergent CTCAE grade 3 
or greater or a sy stemic reaction that is assessed as related to treatment with study drug, 
further dosing of subjects at that dose level will evaluated  and a safety assessment will be  
completed. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be notified of this 
occurrence if appropriate .

9.3.3 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study or to receive study drug at any time without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw from the study or study drug treatment any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion o f the 
Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible, a subject who is discontinued from study treatment should continue to perform the study tests and evaluations until study completion. For subjects who discontinue from the study, the tests and evaluations listed for the Early Termination Visit should be carried out (refer to Section  12.4).  
BioMarin must be notified of all subject with drawals as soon as possible. BioMarin also 
reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for either clinical or administrative reasons and to discontinue participation by [CONTACT_187658]. 
Reasons for which the Investigator or BioMarin may withdraw a subject from the study 
treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:  - protocol.pdf Page 345

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., 
sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a patient administered the study -drug or other 
protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577].  
• Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment run -
in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study-drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagno sis. 
The study period during which all non-serious AEs and SAEs will be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and the first adminstration of study drug  and continues until 
[ADDRESS_223799] visit of the treatment period (refer to Section 12) . After informed consent but prior to initiation of study treatment, 
only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. The criteria 
for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section  10.2.   
The Investig ator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record. 
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see  Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated - protocol.pdf Page 359
 PAL -003 Page 81 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE using the National Can cer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that 
do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of 
daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48622]; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living (ADL)  
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent 
intervention indicatedb 
5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the 
toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.

on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to the IP has not occurred 
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in 
time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the IP; that 
is, there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP.  
Possibly 
Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189578]. 
Probably Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189579].  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189580], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology).

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1 
or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life threatening.  
• Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the patient at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a patient exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event or reaction. 
The reporting period for SAEs begins after informed consent is obtained, and continues until 
[ADDRESS_223801] be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event by [CONTACT_189581] -specific SAE Report Form to 
BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). ). Each SAE must also be reported in the CRF Investigators should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463].The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, the patient is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented in the CRF and in the patient’s medica l record . 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report). 
At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223802] through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and to report the resolution on the Pregnancy Follow -up Form in the study reference materials. In the event of pregnancy in the 
partner of a study subject, the Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected health information. 
10.[ADDRESS_223803] the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Direc tive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensur e that the 
IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours. - protocol.pdf Page 363

review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regula tory 
document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document requirements, CRFs, monitoring requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, including SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of data on CRFs from source documents, adherence to protocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting and drug accountability records.  
The designated clinical data management group will enter or transfer CRF data into a study 
database.

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF  SAMPLE SIZE 
14.1 Statistical and A nalytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency and percent, while continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical analysis.  
14.[ADDRESS_223818] postdose safety information will be included in the safety analyses. 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. A by–subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a serious AE (SAE), including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study drug. 
Clinical laboratory data will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_11876]. Frequency and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference range) and/or 
clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post-treatment visits. Changes from baseline to the post-treatment visits will also be provided. Descriptive statistics, including clinically  significant 
changes from baseine, of vital signs, ECG results, and X-ray results will also be provided. 
14.[ADDRESS_223819] the following PK parameters assessed: area 
under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC), time to maximum plasma concentration 
(T
max), maximum plasma concentration (C max), half life ( t1/2), and clearance (CL/F) .Should 
data become available from PAL -002 or PAL-004 that indicate study drug accumulation 
should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added for PK analysis as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223820]- treatment e fficacy data will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration from baseline to each s cheduled time point and presence/absence of antibodies will also be 
summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L will be summarized by [CONTACT_189515].  
The relationship of dietary Phe intake (per information reported on the subject diet diary) and blood Phe concentration will also be explored. Subjects who received any amount of study drug with any post-treatment blood Phe concentration measurements and diet diary information will be included in this exploratory analysis. Information regarding this exploratory analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analyais Plan.  
For subjects who completed the Substudy, the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -
PEG dosing on safety, blood Phe level, and immune response will be explored. Information regarding the analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analyais Plan.  
14.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Subjects who participated in PAL-002 or PAL-004 may be enrolled into this study. No formal sample size calculation was conducted  for this study or the PAL-003 Substudy.   
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
All analyses will be presented based on observed data only. Missing data will not be imputed for analyses unless sensitivity analyses are warran ted. If imputations are used, detailed 
imputation methods will be described in the SAP before locking the database. 
14.7 Interim Analyses  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study on an ongoing basis (refer to Section  15 for 
information regarding the DMC). 14.[ADDRESS_223821]’s safety is compromised without immediate action. In these - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223822] again provide informed consent.

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 15 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE (DMC)  
The DMC will act independently in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the sa fety 
of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who participate in the study. Meetings of the DMC can be 
convened at any time at the discretion of the DMC Chair or the Study Medical Officer. 
The Chair will be notified by [CONTACT_189583]. The DMC will review the study data as soon as it is available during the study, on a schedule defined in the DMC Charter, and offer advice on whether or not to proceed, modify or terminate study enrollment on the basis of toxicity. Details regarding the DMC membership and safety data to be reviewed by [CONTACT_189470] a charter. 
The responsibilities of the DMC are to:  
• Review the study protocol, informed consent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring.  
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, subjects’ risk versus benefit, and other factors that could affect the study outcome. 
• Consider relevant information that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189316]  9.1.3. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223823]’s disease, that are not part of this study. Costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre- specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The s ubject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance with, treatment for study- related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for th e cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s 
instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531], if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_189585]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with th e law.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223824] be completed using a web–based application that has been validated. Study site personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will correct the value by [CONTACT_187698]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the si te 
personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If an Investigator or institution refuses to allow access to subject records because of confidentiality, arrangements must be made to allow an “interview” style of data verification.  
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189476] “source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, all data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying that the information on the CRFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or desig nee, will then 
set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the - protocol.pdf Page 382

The following table summarizes the revisions made to the protocol and relates the cha nges to the appropriate  rationale. Text that has been 
added or inserted is indicated by [CONTACT_189589], and deleted text is indicated by [CONTACT_189590]. 
Section No./Title   
Section 2/Synopsis (Study 
Sites) Approximately 20 8 centers in the [LOCATION_002] 4 
Section 2/Synopsis (Study Rationale) The need exists for a treatment that will help  individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely 
achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concen trations and improve 
functional outcomes. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL-PEG) is a potential substitute 
for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with 
PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe c oncentrations, which may have additional 
clinical benefits. This study is an  extension of the dose-finding studies
y (Study PAL-002 
and Study PAL-004 ). Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be continued to assess whether 
long-term dosing of rAvPAL-PEG is saf e and can maintain reduced blood Phe 
concentrations in PKU subjects. 
Because rAvPAL-PEG is being assessed as a long-term chronic treatment for patients with 
PKU, there is a need to understand the eff ect of a temporary dosing interruption on the 
safety, efficacy (blood Phe), PK, and immune  response. Therefore, a Substudy has been 
added to this study to assess the effects of st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]-starting rAvPAL-PEG treatment 
in subjects who are on a variety of rAvPAL-PEG dosing regimens (dose level and 
frequency). Up to 10 subjects who are on a variety of dosing regimens (dose level and 
frequency) in this study are eligible for par ticipation in the Substudy and will stop dosing 
for a period of approximately 4 weeks. During this dosing interruption, subjects will be 
assessed for safety, efficacy, PK, and immune response and will continue to perform the 
scheduled study assessments.  
Blood Phe levels depend not only on the f unctional presence of the endogenous enzyme 
PAH but also on the dietary intake of Phe. It is important to understand the role of diet on 
blood Phe levels concurrent with the administration of rAvPAL-PEG treatment. Therefore, 1, 5 - protocol.pdf Page 391

an exploratory objective has been added to this study to assess the relationship of diet, 
rAvPAL-PEG administration, and blood Phe leve l. Changes to subject diet are not allowed 
in this study unless per the Investigator in c onsultation with the Spons or’s Medical Officer. 
Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.  
Section 2/Synopsis 
(Objectives) The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the immune  antibody  response to long-term administration of SC 
injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. 
• To evaluate steady state PK of rAvPAL PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To assess the long-term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration 
following administration with rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]-starting rAvPAL-PEG 
dosing in a subset of subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a nd re-starting rAvPAL-PEG dosing on blood 
Phe concentration in a subset of subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]-starting rAvPAL-PEG dosing on immune 
response in a subset of subjects with PKU.   
• To assess the effect of multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG on the PK profile, in 
particular clearance of drug, when drug is stopped in a subset of subjects with PKU 
who have been previously exposed to rAvPAL-PEG.

 < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s diet may be adjusted to increase the amount of dietary Phe 
intake to maintain target blood Phe concentrations of 120 600 µmol/L. Changes to diet will 
be made per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical 
Officer.  Any decision to modify subject diet must be made per the Investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer and must be performed under the 
supervision of the Investigaor in consulta tion with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.To 
monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet di ary will be issued to subjects for completion 
and will be reviewed with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_81920]’s Medical Officer and if adequate tr aining is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a 
set of criteria to be considered appropriate for self administration .   
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations  throughout the study. 
Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version [ADDRESS_223836] one interim analysis may be performed by [CONTACT_189510]. In addition - protocol.pdf Page 393

to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the 
Sponsor. 
PAL-003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL-PEG. PAL-002 and PAL-004  subjects’ rAvPAL-PEG dosing will continue in 
PAL-[ADDRESS_223837]’s dose will be adjusted 
as needed to attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 6 120-600 µmol/L. Doses will 
be evaluated on an individual basis. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After 
the subject’s blood Phe concentration has b een controlled to within a target range 
(6120-600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and 
blood Phe concentration analyses as needed pe r the discretion of the Investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer but not to exceed 3x/week (fingerstick tests 
may be performed more frequently) .  
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3.  The subject has completed the study through the Month 24 60 visit. 
4.  The study is terminated. 
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may 
also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data 
affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be 
made to retain subjects in the study and to  have them complete the study assessments as 
scheduled as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety.

immune response. Subjects will be eligible for participation in the Substudy provided they 
also meet all of the PAL-[ADDRESS_223839] ration halted for approximately 4 weeks 
regardless of their dosing regimen (dose le vel and frequency). rAvPAL-PEG will not be 
administered during the dose interruption; however, subjects will continue to perform 
assessments for safety, blood Phe concentra tion, PK, and immune response. Subjects 
enrolled into the Substudy will also have a dditional PK sampling performed prior to the 
dosing interruption and during the dosing interruption. To allow for PK sampling once 
dosing is stopped, subjects may be admitted to a research facility within [ADDRESS_223840] week after the dosing interruption.  
Section 2/Synopsis (Dose 
Modifications) Dose Modifications : 
After any modifications (increases or decrease s) to dose level or frequency, subjects should 
remain in the clinic for observation for at least [ADDRESS_223841] for safety.  
Dose Increase Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based  on the decision of the Investigator, in 
agreement with the Study Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend 
on a subject’s adverse event profile and  blood Phe and drug concentrations.  
Blood Phe levels  will be measured 3 days after each dose increase (fingerstick is 2, 3, 21, 22 - protocol.pdf Page 395

acceptable); more frequent or daily blo od Phe measurements may be performed.  
For subjects from PAL-[ADDRESS_223842]’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_223843]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per 
a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be 
performed as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189491] 10-fold higher than 
the subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels 
(0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2,  0.3, 0.4,  0.6, 0.8,  and 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, 
and 5.0  mg/kg) that were defined in the previous study (PAL 002). or per 
Investigator determination in consulta tion with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe 
(60-600 µmol/L) and drug concentrations,  as well as any adverse events (any 
hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total 
weekly dose not to exceed 5 2.0 mg/kg, including subjects who receive more 
than 1 do se/week. Subjects who increase their dose frequency will have 
additional assessments performed (Interim Dosing Visit). 
• When a dose is increased (either by [CONTACT_189591]) , the subject must remain in the c linicbe observed for a 
minimum of 30-[ADDRESS_223844] modified dose 
administration, and an Investigator  will remain on site during this 
time.Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed 
following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase 
the overall weekly dose amount.  
• Only 1 dose (level or frequency)  adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. 
• Blood Phe levels will be measured daily for 3 days after each dose increase 
(fingerstick is acceptable); more frequent  or daily blood Phe measurements - protocol.pdf Page 396
 PAL-003 Page 118 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Section No./Title   
may be performed. 
Dose Decrease Methodology  
A subject’s diet should be assessed prior to an y dose decreases. Changes to diet should only 
be made if a subject’s blood Phe concentrations  < 120 µmol/L. If  a subject’s blood Phe 
level is  < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s dietary Phe intake should be increased to achieve a 
stable blood Phe concentration of 120 600 µmol/L. If the subject’s blood Phe level is 
 < 120 µmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high Phe diet, the rAvPAL PEG dos e will then be decreased. The 
subject will be asked about any changes to di et prior to any dose adjustments, and any 
changes to diet should be made per the discre tion of the Investigator in consultation with 
the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical 
Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding 
a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L > 30% change from baseline ) and drug 
concentrations , as well as any adverse eventst oxicity  (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose 
decreases may occur for safety (ie, blood Phe concentration  < 120 µmol/L) or other 
toxicity any adverse event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose) .  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0,  1.0, 0.8,  0.6, 0.4,  0.3, 0.2,  
0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It  is also permitted to decrease dose in between 
these specified dose levels. If further dosing adju stments are required to attain the target 
Phe concentration, dosing frequency may be reduced.

Section 7.1/Nonclinical 
Studies The nonclinical program for rAvPAL-PEG has characterized the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rA vPAL-PEG using the intended clinical SC 
route of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR  Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse 
model of PKU. The ENU2 mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU 
patients, including hyperphenylalaninemia (bas eline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 
2000 µM) and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL-PEG administered to 
male ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximately 2000 µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week 3 and Week 7 of dosing. Afte r 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL-PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned  as evidenced by [CONTACT_189595] c oncentrations of plasma Phe 
< 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 weeks.  
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG-PAL, two dose interruption assessments were performed:  a 
2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose 
interruption assessments, the animals re-started  rAvPAL-PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL-PEG injections were temporarily 
stopped for 2-4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A 
similar interim attenuated response was observed with the longer dose interruption of 
approximately 11 weeks.  In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL-PEG (Lapis et al., Long-term correction of PKU in the 1, 25 - protocol.pdf Page 403

Safety pharmacology studies were conducte d in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) e ffects were seen with SC administration of 
rAvPAL-PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were observed in telemetr y-instrumented monkeys assessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL-PEG administered subcutaneously.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters we re evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats 
and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half-life (t 1/2) values of rAvPAL-PEG 
administered to normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and 
[ADDRESS_223849] area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve (AUC)-dose. In the cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, 
the t 1/2 was 65 hours at 4.0 mg/kg, 71 hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 
mg/kg (the highest dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey 
appear to have similar characteristics. The following findings were noted: (1) a 
1-compartment model with first-order absorpti on appears to describe the plasma profiles of 
rAvPAL-PEG after single-dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long 
absorption period after SC administration to  maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax), along with a long t 1/2, (3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not 
appear to be a gender difference, and (5) the AUC and the C max are roughly linearly 
proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL-PEG was assessed in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in normal 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-do se rat study, decreased body weight gain and 
Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the 
Kupffer cell finding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a - protocol.pdf Page 404

26-week repeat-dose toxicity and toxicokinetic  (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hy pertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and 
vacuolation of the histiocytic cells were obser ved in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. In a 39-week repeat-dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid nodules 
in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this 
finding was completely reversed after 13-weeks of recovery. The 
no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL-PEG when administered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, 
respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of 
vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells in the rat and arterial inflammation 
findings in the monkey.  
The murine model of phenylketonuria (PKU) BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2), a mouse line that is 
deficient in phenylalanin e hydroxylase (PAH) activity (Shedlovsky, 1993, Genetics), was 
used for in vivo screening and pharmacodynamic studies. This mouse model exhibits 
characteristics similar to those seen in PKU patie nts, including hyperphenylalaninemia 
(baseline plasma phenylalanine [Phe] concentrations of 1000 to 2000  µM) and 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Weekly subcutaneous (SC) administration of 80  mg/kg of rAvPAL PEG 
(approximately 4 IU/mouse) for greater than 2  to 3 months l owered and stabilized plasma 
Phe concentration from approximately 2000 µM to less than 200  µM. A similar profile of 
Phe reduction was also seen in ENU2 mice administered wild type AvPAL PEG 
(4 IU/mouse) over [ADDRESS_223850]. 
In addition to the reduction of plasma Phe, a dose related darkening in coat color occurred, - protocol.pdf Page 405

indicating the biosynthesis of melanin, which was previously inhibited when plasma Phe 
could not be metabolized and plasma Phe concen trations were high. When administration of 
AvPAL PEG was stopped for 2  to 7 weeks and then reinitia ted with weekly 
administrations, no attenuated response was obser ved and Phe concentrations remained low 
and stable until the next administration.  
The safety of rAvPAL PEG was evaluated in safety pharmacology studies (respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
central nervous system [C NS] and cardiovascular [CV]) and toxicity with toxicokinetic 
studies (single and 28 day repeated dose) in rats and c ynomolgus monkeys. Overall, in the 
nonclinical studies, no anaphylactoid like reactions or injection site reactions were noted. 
No specific polyethylene glycol (PEG) related histological findings were observed during 
the 28 day repeated dose studies.  
Findings in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with a single administration of 
60 mg/kg  rAvPAL PEG included  reduced food consumption, dehydration, body wei ght 
loss, hypoactivity, hypothermia,decreased pl asma Phe concentration, decreased protein 
synthesis, and gastrointestinal (GI) lesions. Plas ma Phe concentrations were also reduced to 
below the level of detection in the 4 and 12 mg/kg dose groups, but witho ut similar 
toxicological consequences, implying that the physiological regulation of Phe levels may be 
an important factor for influencing morbidity.  
The main finding in the 28 day study was the possible drug related observation of minimal 
to slight degen eration of blood vessels of predominantly medium sized muscular arteries 
with a non dose dependent involvement of different organs observed in 1 male in the 
0.1 mg/kg and 1  male and 1 female in the 1.0  mg/kg rAvPAL PEG dose groups. No 
degeneration of the a rteries was observed in either the control or animals administered 0.01 
mg/kg rAvPAL PEG.

administration of rAvPAL PEG, the half life was 65  hours at 4  mg/kg, 71 hours at 
12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest dose). Qualitatively , the 
kinetics of rAvPAL PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have similar characteristics. The 
following findings were noted: (1)  a 1compartment model with first order absorption 
appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL PEG after single dose admi nistration, 
(2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after SC administration to

monophasic, (4)  there does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) AUC and the 
maximum plasma concentration (C max) are roughly linearly proportional.  
Chronic repeat dose toxicity and toxicokinetic studies were conducted in the rat 
(17/26  weeks) and monkey (39 weeks). In the 26 week study of rats, weight loss was 
obser ved in the rats given 25 mg/kg/dose of rAvPAL PEG, SC; corresponding decreased 
food consumption was observed in the males. The main histological finding was 
focal tomultifocal areas of vacuolar degeneration of renal tubule cells in the kidney of 
3 males g iven 25  mg/kg and 3  females given  ≥ 8 mg/kg rAvPAL PEG. This  renal tubule 
finding persisted in the kidney of both sexes given  ≥ 8 mg/kg/dose at the end of the 
12week recovery phase without evidence of  reversibility. Increased vacuolation was 
observed in  histiocytic cells of the liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph node, mandibular lymph 
node, and adrenal cortex of males given 25  mg/kg/dose and females given  ≥ 8 mg/kg/dose; 
vacuolation of histiocytic cells in the testes were also observed in males given 
25 mg/kg/dose. Both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have been 
associated with PEG related catabolism and administrati on of other PEGylated proteins.

levels of 7.0 and 5.0  mg/kg/dose rAvPAL PEG were not tolerated in female monkeys and 
resulted in body weight loss, decreased food consumption, and hypoactivity. The only 
adverse microscopic finding was arteri al inflammation of small and mid sized arteries in 
multiple organs an d/or tissues in most animals that were given  ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose rAvPAL
PEG SC twice weekly at the end of the dosing phase. The inter individual organ 
involvement was highly variable; some animal s had findings in one organ and others had 
multiple organs with a rterial inflammation. Additionally, not all arteries had signs of 
inflammation and arterial inflammation was resolved by [CONTACT_2671] [ADDRESS_223852] level (NOAEL) for the 17 week and 39 week studies, in rat and

Section 7.2/Previous 
Clinical Studies This study is an extension of the second human clinical study with rAvPAL PEG 
(Study  PAL 002). Study PAL 001, the first inhuman clinical study of rAvPAL PEG, wa s 
designed as a Phase 1, open label, single dose, dose escalation study in 25  subjects, 16  to 
50 years old, with PKU. The doses for this study are based on data from nonclinical studies 
and PAL 001 and are 0.001 through 1.0  mg/kg per injection (not to exce ed 2.0  mg/kg/week, 
provided no dose limiting toxicity was observed in Study PAL 002. 
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of rAvPAL-PEG in reduci ng blood Phe concentra tions in PKU patients 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan® or are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment.

Section 7.2.1/Phase 1 
Study: PAL-[ADDRESS_223853] of rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe 
concentrations.  
The effectiveness of rAvPAL-PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies 
of ENU2 mice was consistent with what  was observed in PAL-001. PAL-001 enrolled 
25 PKU subjects with a mean (standard devia tion; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 
1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolle d into the study were assigned to receive a 
single administration of rAvPAL-PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects each received 1 of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL-PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL-001 are summarized as follows:  
• rAvPAL-PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood-lowering 
effect on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  
• For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG, clinically 
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically 
significant decreases from baseline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3% 
(mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was 
1113 µmol/L.  
• Overall, no clinically significant reducti ons in blood Phe level were observed in 
subjects who were administered rAvPAL-PEG  at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003, 20 - protocol.pdf Page 409
 PAL-003 Page 131 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Section No./Title   
0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg.  
• For subjects who were administered rAvPAL-PEG at the 3 higher dose levels (0.01, 
0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL-PEG concentration levels,  
the calculated PK parameters were a mean T max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/2 of 
46-120 hours, and an AUC 0-t, and C max that were proportional with dose. Drug 
exposure was slightly increased with increased dose.  
 
Section 7.2.2/Phase 2 
Studies: PAL-002 and PAL-004 Currently, rAvPAL-PEG is being investigated in two Phase 2 clinical trials (PAL-002 and 
PAL-004). To date (JAN2011), a total of [ADDRESS_223854] for Study 
PAL-004.   
In PAL-002 (A Phase 2, Open-Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple  Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU), 
approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled a nd will be administered multiple doses of 
rAvPAL-PEG up to 5.0 mg/kg/week. PAL-002 is a 2-part study. In Part 1, subjects will be 
assigned to 1 of 4 rAvPAL-PEG dose cohorts (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg). 
rAvPAL-PEG will be administered at a fixed weekly dose of 0.001 mg/kg (Cohort 1), 
0.003 mg/kg (Cohort 2), 0.01 mg/kg (Cohort 3), 1.0 mg/kg (Cohort 4), or 0.1 mg/kg (Part 1 
Substudy) for 8 weeks. In Part 2, all subjects who complete Part 1 will be administered an 
adjustable dose of rAvPAL-PEG for up to an additional 8 weeks. Th e dose administered in 
Part 2 may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189564]/or  dose frequency to reach a target blood Phe 
concentration of 60-600 µmol/L. Study PAL- 003 (Long-Term Extension of a Phase 2, 
Open-Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of 
Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU) is an extension study

for up to an additional [ADDRESS_223856] of  multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU for up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary 
objectives of the study are (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of 
multiple dose levels of rAvPAL-PEG, (2) to evaluate the antibody response to rAvPAL-
PEG, and (3) to evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. The study 
protocol was amended (30APR2010)  to include a substudy of an additional rAvPAL-PEG 
dose level (0.1 mg/kg/week) that reduced blood Phe concentrations to clinically significant 
levels in the Phase 1 study, PAL-001. The protocol was amended again (28MAR2011) to 
increase the starting dose for Cohort 4 from 0.03 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week. To date 
(JAN2011), [ADDRESS_223857] been dosed with 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG. Additional information about the 
safety reported to date (JAN2011) is provided in Section 7.4.2.  
Study PAL-004 is designed to determine if da ily administration of rAvPAL-PEG at daily 
dose levels (0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day) is safe and effective in reducing and 
maintaining consistent blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. It is hypothesized 
that a higher starting dose and frequency will reduce blood Phe concentrations to 
near-normal levels in a timely manner and will provide the greatest clinical benefit. 
Considering the concentration and volume of dr ug that is administered subcutaneously, the 
only way to increase the rAvPAL-PEG dose is vi a daily administration. Therefore, in Study 
PAL-004, a higher starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg will be administered 5 days a week (referred 
to as daily), a dosing regimen that has been observed to be tolerated and to reduce blood 
Phe concentrations to clinically meaningful le vels in previously exposed subjects in this 
study. Following completion of Study PAL-004, subjects have the option to enroll into this - protocol.pdf Page 411

study and to continue to receive doses of rA vPAL-PEG for up to an additional 60 months.  
In this study, subjects in PAL-002 and PAL-004 w ill continue to be administered the same 
rAvPAL-PEG that was administered in PAL-002 or PAL-004. If the safety, PK, and blood 
Phe concentration results from either PAL- 002 or PAL-004 indicate that the appropriate 
level of PEGylation and dosing regimen diffe rs from that administered in PAL-002 or 
PAL-004, the PEGylation and/or dosing regimen administered in this study may change.    
 
Section 7.3/Study 
Rationale Because rAvPAL-PEG is being assessed as a long-term chronic treatment for patients with 
PKU, there is a need to understand the eff ect of a temporary dosing interruption on the 
safety, efficacy (blood Phe), PK, and immune response. To date (JAN2011), there is limited 
information on the effects of a rAvPAL-PEG dose interruption in subjects with PKU. 
Therefore, a Substudy has been added to this  study to assess the effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]-
starting rAvPAL-PEG treatment in subjects who are on a variety of rAvPAL-PEG dosing 
regimens (dose level and frequency). Up to 10 subjects who are on a variety of dosing 
regimens (dose level and frequency) in this study are eligible for participation in the 
Substudy and will stop dosing for a period of approximately 4 weeks. During this dosing 
interruption, subjects will be assessed for saf ety, efficacy, PK, and immune response and 
will continue to perform the scheduled study assessments. There is no information 
regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rAvPAL-PEG when blood Phe levels are at 
60-600 µmol/L for subjects on a multiple-dose regimen. To address this lack of 
information, additional PK sampling will be performed prior to the dosing interruption. 
Upon restarting rAvPAL-PEG, PK sampling will al so be performed to allow for collection 
of drug exposure data (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] and 
maximum plasma concentration [C max]), absorption rate, and clearance for subjects who 
have been previously exposed to rAvPAL-PEG  in this Substudy. This information will 1, 5 - protocol.pdf Page 412

PEG treatment from the Phase [ADDRESS_223858] diet are not allowed 
in this study unless per the Investigator in c onsultation with the Spons or’s Medical Officer. 
Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.    
This study is an extension of the dose-finding studies y (PAL-002 and PAL-004 ). 
Administration of rAvPAL-PEG will be con tinued to assess whether long-term dosing of 
rAvPAL-PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects. 
 
Section 7.4/Summary of 
Overall Risks and Benefits It is not expected that data from PAL-002 or PAL-004  will change the assumption that 
rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. 4 
Section 7.4.1/Toxicitity Due to Exposure to PEG Acute exposure to high doses of PEG can result in renal toxicity. There have been a few reports of PEG-related AEs in humans; cumu lative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, o liguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG 
exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL- PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely used medicines and other compounds that are administered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_123001] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.). No indication of PEG-related toxicity at the ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kg 25 - protocol.pdf Page 413

rAvPAL-PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule v acuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been assocated with PEG-related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins  
(refer to Section 7.1).  
 
Section 7.4.2/Toxicity Due 
to an Immunologic Reactions In Study PAL-001, there were 11 subjects (out of 25 subjects in the study) with skin-related 
reactions (injection-site bruising, erythema, pain, rash, swelling, and urticaria) that occurred 
following the single administration of rAvPAL-PEG. For all of these subjects, the reactions 
were generalized skin reactions or injection- site skin reactions that did not compromise 
other organs and were not life-threateni ng. These suspected antibody-mediated responses 
were nonserious and mild or moderate in sever ity. These subjects are not considered to be at 
significant risk for antibody-mediated reactions with injection of rAvPAL-PEG during 
PAL-002, PAL-004, or this study; however, specific precautions for these subjects will be 
taken during this study to monitor subject safety (refer to Section 9.1.1).  
In Study PAL-002, [ADDRESS_223859] been dosed to date (JAN2011), including at dose levels 
of 2.0 mg/kg/week (or 0.4 mg/kg/5 days a w eek). Most reactions reported in these subjects 
have been nonserious and mild or moderate in severity. There has been 1 SAE reported to 
date; the event was reported as not related to tr eatment with study drug. There have been no 
reports of anaphylaxis to date (JAN2011). Subjects who have a systemic reaction during 
this study will undergo a series of assessment s to monitor safety, including assessment of 
IgE antibodies, prior to determining if dosing may resume. Additionally, subjects who have 
systemic reactions will be premedicated and will be monitored closely for safety (refer to 
Section 9.1.6 for additional information regarding continued treatment of subjects with 
systemic reactions during the study).

Section [IP_ADDRESS]/Systemic 
Skin Reactions Two out of 25 subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL-001 and received the 
protocol-defined single dose of rAvPAL-PEG reported systemic skin reactions (generalized skin rash) that were attributed to treatment  with study drug. One subject received a single 
dose of 0.001 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG, and the other subject received a single dose of 0.01 mg/kg rAvPAL-PEG. Both of these events were reported as serious and followed 
administration  One of these events was reported as serious, and the other was reported as 
nonserious; both events were reported following administration  of Depo-Provera injections 
(medroxyprogesterone injection), an injectable contraception. These allergic reactions are 
thought to be related to the PEG molecules that are found in both the study drug, rAvPAL-PEG, and Depo-Provera. These reactions are not lik ely to be experienced concurrent with 
other birth control medications.

[IP_ADDRESS]/Management of Allergic Reactions Allergic reactions to the SC injecti on of rAvPAL-PEG may be mild, moderate , or severe in 
intensity. Reactions may include pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or anaphylaxis. Clinical assessments s hould be conducted for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223862]-injection. Longer observations may be required at the discretion of the 
PI. The responsible physician should use all appropriate measures for the treatment of

Section 7.4.3/Effects of 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189344]-Starting rAvPAL-PEG Treatment The effects of starting, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and re-s tarting rAvPAL-PEG dosing on safety and blood 
Phe reductions previously achieved through rAvPAL-PEG dosing are not well defined, and 
there is limited clinical experience with rAvPAL-PEG. Allergic reactions are a common 
and expected clinical outcome of re-starti ng biologic drugs, such as rAvPAL-PEG, and may 
occur when subjects re-start rAvPAL-PEG dos ing. However, no information reported from 
the ongoing clinical studies, including this study,  or nonclinical results point to an increased 
safety risk or decreased efficacy when rAvPAL-PEG dos ing is stopped and then re-started 
at the same dose level:  
• Nonclinical experience in the the BTBR  Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model indicates 
that dosing interruptions of 2-4 weeks for mice administered rAvPAL-PEG 
80 mg/kg/week had no increased safety risk  upon re-starting dosing and there was 
an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions  (refer to Section 7.1).

not been any immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to rAvPAL-
PEG observed following administration of a rAvPAL-PEG injection. All reactions 
to rAvPAL-PEG have been reported approximately 12-[ADDRESS_223864] anaphylaxis or a 
severe systemic reaction. Thus, it is not anticipated that reactions to rAvPAL-PEG 
are IgE-mediated.   
• To date (JAN2011), the clinical experien ce with re-starting rAvPAL-PEG dosing 
for subjects from Study PAL-[ADDRESS_223865] on reducing blood Phe levels 
upon re-introduction of drug.  
o Nine subjects who received a single dose of rAvPAL-PEG and completed 
the Phase 1 study, PAL-001, rolled ove r into the multiple-dose, Phase 2 
study, PAL-002. After a period of several months during which no drug 
was administered, these 9 subjects re-s tarted rAvPAL-PEG dosing in Study 
PAL-002 at the same starting doses as was administered in Study PAL-001. 
There has been no difference to date in the safety profile or efficacy profile 
of the subjects from Study PAL-001 who rolled over into Study PAL-002 
(previously exposed to rAvPAL-PEG) when compared with subjects who 
were naive to rAvPAL-PEG dosing in Study PAL-002. Although 
previously exposed subjects had higher and a faster return of anti-PAL and 
anti-PEG IgG titers than those of naïve subjects, these results have not been 
associated with a higher safety risk or  efficacy riskbased on information to 
date.   - protocol.pdf Page 418

o In Study PAL-002, [ADDRESS_223866] had a protocol-defined (per 
Protocol Amendment # 3 dated 30A PR2010), 2-week washout (no dose 
administered) following several weeks of a fixed dose of 0.06 mg/kg/week 
or 0.1 mg/kg/week rAvPAL-PEG. Following the [ADDRESS_223867] experienced additional 
safety issues. Eight subjects continue to receive dosing with rAvPAL-PEG 
(APR 2011) and have subsequently increased their dose level without 
additional reported adverse events that have resulted in a subsequent dosing 
interruption.  
 
In this study, measures will be taken to re duce the risk to subject safety upon re-starting 
rAvPAL-PEG dosing while still allowing for reductions in blood Phe level to clinical 
significance (blood Phe reduction to 60-600 µmol/L). To mitigate the possible safety risks - protocol.pdf Page 419

upon re-starting rAvPAL-PEG dosing, re-intr oduction of dosing should be performed in the 
clinic, and the subject must be observed for 30-[ADDRESS_223868] safety. Subjects will also continue to be assessed per 
the safety assessment and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189357] d in Section 9.1.3 and Section 9.1.4, and 
dose decreases will continue to be performed re lative to safety as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
To mitigate the possible reduced effect on blood Phe level upon re-starting rAvPAL-PEG, 
subjects in this study who interrupt dosing whether per the protocol (ie, subjects 
participating in the Substudy; refer to Secti on 9.1) or for other reasons (refer to Section 
9.4.10) will re-start rAvPAL-PEG dosing at the same dose level.      
 
Section 7.4.3/Effects of 
Low Blood Phe  Insufficient Phe intake or excessive rAvPAL PEG exposure may cause blood Phe 
concentrations to be too low (eg,   30 µmol/L). Prolonged low b lood Phe concentrations 
can result in a catabolic state associated w ith poor growth and a ltered body functions, 
including mental and physical alterations, loss of appetite, anemia, rashes, and diarrhea. To 
ensure safety during this study, subjects will be monitored closely with frequent blood Phe 
concentration determinations. If a subject’s blood Phe concentration is too low, the 
subject’s diet, current dose of study drug, or both may be adjusted.

Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Section No./Title   
following administration with rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows:  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]-starting rAvPAL-PEG 
dosing in a subset of subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a nd re-starting rAvPAL-PEG dosing on blood 
Phe concentration in a subset of subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a nd re-starting rAvPAL-PEG dosing on immune  
response in a subset of subjects with PKU.   
• To assess the effect of multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG on the PK profile, in 
particular clearance of drug, when drug is stopped in a subset of subjects with PKU 
who have been previously exposed to rAvPAL-PEG.

Diet will should  not be altered during the course of this study, except as necessary for safety 
as determined by [CONTACT_189597]. If a subject’s  blood Phe concentration is 
 < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s diet may be adjusted to increase the amount of dietary Phe 
intake to maintain target blood Phe concentrations of 120 600 µmol/L. Changes to diet will 
be made per the discretion of the Investigator in  consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical 
Officer.  For information regarding changes to diet for safety and decreases in dose, refer to 
Section  9.1.[ADDRESS_223870] be made per the Investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer and must be performed under the 
supervision of the Investigaor in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. To 
monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet di ary will be issued to subjects for completion 
and will be reviewed with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical 
Officer and if adequate training is provided. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be 
considered appropriate for self administration. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_223871] Self-Administration Training Materials.  
Subjects will be evaluated for safety and for blood Phe concentrations  throughout the study. 
Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version [ADDRESS_223872] one interim analysis may be performed by [CONTACT_189598].  In addition 
to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in

blood Phe concentration analyses as needed pe r the discretion of the Investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer .but not to exceed 3x/week (fingerstick tests 
may be performed more frequently).  
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
1. The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
2. The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
3. The subject has completed the study through the Month 24 60 visit. 
4. The study is terminated. 
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may 
also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data 
affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be 
made to retain subjects in the study and to  have them complete the study assessments as

Section [IP_ADDRESS]/Dose Increase Methodology Each subject’s dose may be modified based  on the decision of the Investigator, in 
agreement with the Study Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend 
on a subject’s adverse event profile and
 blood Phe and drug concentrations.  
Blood Phe levels will be measured 3 days  after each dose increase (fingerstick is 
acceptable); more frequent or daily blood Ph e measurements may be performed.  
For subjects from PAL-[ADDRESS_223884]’s dose may be adjusted be ginning on Day [ADDRESS_223885]’s dose ma y be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s 
adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed  as 
follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189491] 10-fold higher than 
the subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels 
(0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2,  0.3, 0.4,  0.6, 0.8,  and 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0,

based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe 
(60-600 µmol/L) and drug concentrations,  as well as any adverse events (any 
hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total 
weekly dose not to exceed 5 2.0 mg/kg, including subjects who receive more 
than 1 dose/week. Subjects who increase their dose frequency should perform 
the Interim Dosing Visit assessments (refer to Section 12.3.6 5 and Table 2.1.3

• When a dose is increased (either by [CONTACT_189600] y of dosing) , the subject must remain in the clinic be observed for a 
minimum of 30-[ADDRESS_223886] modified dose 
administration, and an Investigator  will remain on site during this 
time.Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed 
following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase 
the overall weekly dose amount.  
• Only 1 dose (level or frequency)  adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. 
• Blood Phe levels will be measured daily for 3 days after each dose increase 
(fingerstick is acceptable); more frequent  or daily blood Phe measurements 
may be performed. 
 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]/Dose 
Decrease Methodology A subject’s diet should be assessed prio r to any dose decre ases. Changes to d iet should only 
be made if a subject’s blood Phe concentrations  < 120 µmol/L. If a subject’s blood Phe 
level is  < 120 µmol/L, the subject’s dietary Phe intake should be increased to achieve a 
stable blood Phe concentration of 120 600 µmol/L. If the subje ct’s blood Phe level is 
 < 120 µmol/L despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a high Phe diet, the rAvPAL PEG dose will then be decreased. The 
subject will be asked about any changes to di et prior to any dose adjustments, and any 
changes to diet should be made per the discretion of the I nvestigator in consultation with 
the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical 
Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding 
a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L > 30% change from baseline ) and drug 
concentrations , as well as any adverse eventst oxicity  (any hypersensitivity reaction as 
defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie, blood Phe 
concentration  < 120 µmol/L) or other toxicity any adverse event that may be improved with 
a lower, more frequent dose) .  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0,  1.0, 0.8,  0.6, 0.4,  0.3, 0.2,

Section 10.1/ Adverse Events According to the ICH definition, an AE (or adverse experience) is “any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patie nt or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, and that does not necessarily have a cau sal relationship with this treatment. An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding),  symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the IP.” For this protocol, a 
reportable adverse event (AE) is any untowar d medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a patient administer ed the study-drug or other protocol-imposed 
intervention, regardless of attri bution. This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577].  
• Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no-treatment run-15 - protocol.pdf Page 444
 PAL-003 Page 166 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Section No./Title   
in). 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is describe d by [CONTACT_189458] “all noxious and unintended 
responses to a medicinal product related to any dose.” This means that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and  an AE is at least a reasonable  possibility, ie, the 
relationship cannot be ruled out An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal rela tionship between the study-drug and the AE . 
An AE may include intercurrent illnesses or in juries that represent an exacerbation (increase 
in frequency, severity, or specificity) of pre existing conditions (eg, worsening of asthma).  
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. 
The reporting period for non serious AEs is the period from the first administration of study 
drug through the final F/U Visit or at the  ETV. If a non serious AE remains unresolved at 
the conclusion of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_189364] a joint clinical 
assessment as to whether continued follow up of the AE is warranted, and the results of this 
assessment must be documented. R esolution is defined as the return to baseline status or 
stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
The study period during which all non-serious AEs and SAEs will be reported begins after 
informed consent is obtained and the first adminstration of study drug  and continues until 
[ADDRESS_223900] visit of the treatment 
period (refer to Section 12). After informed consent but prior to initiation of study 
treatment, only SAEs associated with any prot ocol-imposed interventions will be reported.  
The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in The Investigator will 
assess AEs for severity, for relationship to IP, and as to whether the event meets one or 
more of the definitions of a serious adverse event (SAE; refer to Section 10.2 ). - protocol.pdf Page 445
 PAL-003 Page 167 
 
Proprietary and Confidential   May 04, 2011 Section No./Title   
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or 
stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or study participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be 
documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record.  
The Investigator responsible for the care of the patient or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to 
seriousness, which is based on patient/event out come or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a patient’s  life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that 
do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general 
guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. and will record it on the 
source documents and AE CRF, using the CTCAE v  3 grades defined below. Events that 
are CTCAE grades 4 and 5 are serious events and require completion of both an SAE form 
and AE eCRF.  
Grade Description 
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated

5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
oneself, using the toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, howev er, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on subject/event out come or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functionin g. Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
The Investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the IP study drug  and will 
record it on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below.

• Is an important medical event or reaction.  
A SAE is defined as any AE that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life threatening,  that is, places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred. This definition does not  include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189365]. Admission of a subject to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189366] a result of 
an AE, even if the subject is released on the same day, qualifies as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapaci ty. An event qualifies as 
resulting in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity if it involves a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out usual life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relati vely minor or

monitoring visit to obtain additional case de tails deemed necessary to appropriately 
evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74378], consultant report, or autopsy 
report).  
At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal ph ysician(s) believes might be related to prior 
study treatment.  
The investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated stud y participation if felt to be related to prior 
study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator should become 
aware of the development of cancer or of a c ongenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived

Section 10.3/Pregnancy Pregnancy in a subject or partner should be reported immediately ( within 24 hours of the 
site becoming aware of the pregnancy ) to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance by [CONTACT_189611].  In addition, pregnancy in a subject is also 
reported on the End of Study CRF. The Investigator must make every effort to follow the 
subject through resolution of the pregnancy (d elivery or termination) and to report the 
resolution on the Pregnancy Follow-up Form in the study reference materials. In the event 
of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s c onsent for release of protected health 
information. 15 
Section 10.4/Urgent Safety 
Measures  The regulations governing clinical trials state that the sponsor and Investigator are required 
to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate 
hazards that may affect the safety of subject s, and that the appropr iate regulatory bodies 
should be notified according to their respectiv e regulations. According to the European 
Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in  the light of the circumstances, 
notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the 
development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to 
affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor  and the Investigator shall take appropriate 
urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor 
shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken 
and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notif ied at the same time.” The reporting period 
for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the 
period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or 
at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the 
implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours.  
Examples of situations that may require urge nt safety measures include discovery of the 15 - protocol.pdf Page 451

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY  
Amendment: 4  
Date: June 7, 2012 
 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The protocol for Study PAL-003 is being amended to make the following changes: 
1. Assessment of spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio has been added at study entry for 
newly enrolled subjects. In addition, all subjects will now have spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio assessed monthly after study entry. Complements (C3 and C4) will also b e collected and assessed at study entry and every 3  months for all 
subjects; if complement levels are abnormal upon assessment, sampling will be performed monthly.   
Rationale for change:  The urine albumin/creatinine ratio and C3 and C4 tests have been 
added because they are measures of potential renal injury resulting from an immunologic 
reaction to rAvPAL- PEG. Several subjects currently being treated with rAvPAL -PEG have 
developed antibodies to rAvPAL-PEG and evidence of consumption of complement. While no subject in a rAvPAL-PEG study has had clinical laboratory evidence of renal injury as of May 2012, these tests have been added to increase detection of sensitivity to renal injury and 
to evaluate the potential for a clinically meaningful safety signal.  
2. Subjects who meet the criteria for blood Phe levels and rAvPAL-PEG dose will now 
have their blood Phe concentration collected monthly rather than weekly. 
Rationale for change:  Subjects will have their blood Phe concentration assessed monthly 
versus weekly if they have been on a stable dose of rAvPAL-PEG (ie, no dose change in the last 2 weeks) and have had a phenylalanine (Phe) level at or below target range (60-600 µmol/L ) for [ADDRESS_223913]’s blood Phe increases to 
 > 600 µmol/L  or decreases to  ≤ 30 µmol/L  for 
any of the monthly blood Phe draws, that subject should perform weekly blood Phe dr aws 
until the rAvPAL- PEG dose has been adjusted and the Phe level returns to within the 
protocol- defined target range for at least 2 weeks.   - protocol.pdf Page 465
 PAL -003 A4 Page 3 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
3. Information regarding hypersensitivity reactions and rAvPAL- PEG treatment, 
including how to treat hypersensitivity reactions, has been updated. 
Rationale for change:  As of May 2012, a total of [ADDRESS_223914] been administered 
rAvPAL -PEG in the Phase 1 (PAL-001) and Phase 2 (PAL-002 and -004) studies, including 
this extension study. With the information from these [ADDRESS_223915] care following a hypersensitivity reaction 
has been modified based on this additional information.  
4. A fixed dose of rAvPAL- PEG will be administered in this study. Additionally, a 
higher concentration of rAvPAL- PEG (15 mg/ml vs. 10 mg/ml) will be administered. 
Subjects who have demonstrated efficacy (ie, Phe within target range 60-600 µmol/L)  
for at least two consecutive Phe assessments may convert their weight -based 
rAvPAL -PEG dose to a fixed dose and may also divide their weekly dose into a 
7-days-a-week dosing regimen. 
Rationale for change:  The Phase 3 rAvPAL -PEG program will be conducted using a 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing concentration of 15 mg/ml, a fixed dose, and a 7- days-a-week dosing 
regimen. This extension study is being amended to incorporate the planned Phase [ADDRESS_223916] weight of 80 kg (based on the subjects in previous rAvPAL- PEG 
studies).  Efficacy information regarding the fixed doses will be collected in this study and 
the Phase 2 study, 165-205. Subjects who are on a fixed-dose regimen will be monitored for 
safety per the safety plan outlined in the pro tocol. The 15 mg/ml rAvPAL -PEG  formulation 
is more concentrated than the 10 mg/ml formulation, allowing for fewer injections per dose. 
It is hypothesized that hypersensitivity reactions could be related to maximum plasma concentration  (C
max); therefore, subjects who qualify for home or self administration may 
divide their weekly dose for administration up to 7 days per week.   
5. A pharmacokinetics (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of 
rAvPAL -PEG in a minimum of [ADDRESS_223917] 2 consecutive weeks and for whom no further dose 
modifications are planned. A corresponding PK substudy objective has been added. 
Rationale for change:  Subjects who are being treated with  an efficacious dose of 
rAvPAL -PEG (ie, have received the same rAvPAL -PEG dose for at least 2 consecutive 
weeks) and for whom no further dose modifications are planned  will qualify for the PK substudy. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223918] been collected from the Phase 1 study, PAL-001; however, there is 
little multiple -dose PK data when a stable dosing regimen has been implemented. With the 
PK substudy, multiple- dose PK data will be collected for subjects who have already achieved 
and maintained Phe reduction to within the protocol- defined target range.    
6. The previous PK substudy that required stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189367]-PEG dosing 
has been removed. No subjects were enrolled into this PK substudy. 
Rationale for change:  The previous PK substudy was designed to exami ne the effect of 
rAvPAL -PEG dosing interruptions on safety, efficacy, PK, and immune response.  This 
substudy has been discontinued because it requires subjects to discontinue treatment with 
rAvPAL -PEG, which would halt any Phe reduction benefits that may have occurred with 
treatment. The corresponding substudy objectives have been removed.  Unscheduled dose interruptions may still occur due to adverse events per the Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
7. Finger stick Phe assessments have been removed.  
Rationale for change:  The plasma Phe samples currently implemented in the study provide sufficient assessment of blood Phe levels without subjecting subjects to the additional and painful finger stick procedure. The site staff may perform assessments of Phe levels at the local laboratory if needed.  
8. Guidance for treating subjects who develop hypophenylalaninemia has been added. 
Rationale for change:  Although there is no evidence in the literature that low Phe is of clinical significance in adults, it is hypothesized that sustained low blood Phe is a clinical 
concern because Phe is an essential amino acid.  Guidelines for treating subjects whose 
serum Phe levels reach ≤ 30 μmol/L for a minimum of [ADDRESS_223919] performed a blood draw upon completion of a previous rAvPAL-PEG study do not need to perform another blood draw at the Screening Visit of this study if the blood draw was performed within 
28 days. Safety and efficacy information are not expected to change in the 28 days from completion of a previous rAvPAL- PEG study and the start of this study.  
Rationale for change:  Currently, subjects in Studies PAL-002 and PAL- 004 immediately 
enroll  into the PAL-003 extension study (ie, do not stop rAvPAL-PEG dosing).  The

similar to the end -of-study blood draw performed for Studies PAL -002 and PAL-004.  When 
subjects enroll over into Study PAL-003 within 28 days of completing a previous 
rAvPAL -PEG study, the screening blood draw is not needed. Safety and efficacy information 
is not expected to change in the 28 days from completion of a previous rAvPAL- PEG study 
and the start of this study.   
10. Information regarding the management of allergic reactions has been updated.  
Rationale for change:  Administration of oral or IV glucocorticoids has been added as a 
recommended treatment.  
11. The inclusion criteria have been modified to allow enrollment of subjects from a 
Phase 2 rAvPAL- PEG study.  
Rationale for change:  This change will allow enrollment of subjects who complete Study 165-205.    
12. Assessment of urinalysis test results has been moved from the local laboratory to the 
central laboratory.  
Rationale for change:  This change will help standardize test results across sites.    
13. Subject weight will now be measured monthly rather than weekly. 
Rationale for change:  Because the study is moving f rom weight-based dosing to a fixed 
dosing regimen (see amendment item #5 above), there is no need to obtain weight on a 
weekly basis.    
14. Subject diet diaries will be assessed monthly rather than weekly.  
Rationale for change:  Weekly diet diary assessment p rovides no added benefit to safety or 
efficacy when compared with monthly diet diaries. Monthly diet diary assessments will 
provide sufficient safety and efficacy information while increasing feasibility of completion 
for sites and subjects. 
15. Information re garding clinical rAvPAL -PEG studies has been updated. 
Rationale for change:  Information regarding Studies PAL -[ADDRESS_223920] been made to improve clarity and consistency.

TITLE OF STUDY : 
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open- Label Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, E fficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL -PEG in Subjects with PKU  
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL -003 
STUDY SITES :  Approximately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT :  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE : 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve 
lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rA vPAL -PEG) 
is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have 
additional clinical benefits. This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase [ADDRESS_223922] diet are not allowed in this study unless per the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. D iet will be monitored using a diet diary. 
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in 
a minimum of [ADDRESS_223923]:

when subjects have reached and maintained a stable dosing regimen.  With the PK su bstudy, multiple -
dose PK data will be collected for subjects who have already achieved Phe reduction to within the 
protocol- defined target range. 
OBJECTIVES : 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long -term administration of multiple doses of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the immune response to long- term administration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration 
following administration with rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows: 
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who have achieved and maintained 
target blood Phe concentration and for whom no further dose modifications are planned. 
 
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN : 
This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL-PEG Phase 2 studies in approximately 100 subjects with 
PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested in PAL -002 and PAL-004 (starting 
at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week), provided no dose- limiting toxicity is observed in a previous 
rAvPAL -PEG study.  
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL -PEG study will be enrolled into this study. Subjects

monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be 
reviewed with the clinical study staff on a monthly basis.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_2725]’s 
Medical Officer and if adequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be considered appropriate for self administration.   
Subjects  will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
version  4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’ pre vious rAvPAL -PEG dosing will continue in PAL-003. In PAL-003, each 
subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 
60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose 
(subjects who have maintained blood Phe levels to 60-600 µmol/L for at least [ADDRESS_223927] 2 consecutive weeks). Doses will be 
evaluated on an individual basis.  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range (60-600 µmol/L), the subject may 
be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223928]:

the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
• A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator.  
•  The subject has completed the study through the Month 60 visit. 
•  The study is terminated.  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will be ask ed to 
continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from 
study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, 
and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to 
have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not 
compromise subject safety.

Dose Modifications : 
Dose Increase Methodology
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator, in agreement with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse 
event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations.  : 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_223930]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile 
and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows.

current dose.  
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the do se levels (0.001, 0.003, 
0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, and 5.0 mg/kg)) or per 
Investigator determination in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60 -600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse 
events (any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly dose not 
to exceed 5.0 mg/kg.  Subjects who increase their dose fr equency will have additional 
assessments performed (Interim Dosing Visit).  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_223933] 
modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be 
observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the 
overall weekly dose amount.  
• Only [ADDRESS_223934] be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical Officer. 
Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases 
may occur for safety (ie, any adverse event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose).  Dose Decrease Methodology  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose 
levels. If further dosing adjustments are required to attain the target Phe concentration, dosing 
frequency may be reduced.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L as measured by [CONTACT_189614] a minimum of 1 month), the subject’s rAvPAL-PEG dose should be decreased to 
the next lower dose. If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_223935] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods

7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) is contained in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator 
should review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program for rAvPAL -PEG has characterized the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG using the intended clinical SC route 
of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of 
PKU. The ENU2 mouse m odel exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, 
including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) 
and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL- PEG administered to male 
ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximately 2000  µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week  3 and Week 7 of dosing. After 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL- PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned as evidenced by [CONTACT_189563] 
< 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 weeks.  
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG -PAL, two dose interruption as sessments were performed:  a 
2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose interruption assessments, the animals re -started rAvPAL -PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL- PEG in jections were temporarily 
stopped for 2-4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A similar interim attenuated response was observed with the longer dose interruption of approximately 11 weeks.   In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG (Lapis, 2007, ASHG 57th Annual Meeting) . 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) effects were seen with SC administration of rAvPAL -PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were ob served in telemetry -instrumented monkeys assessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL -PEG administered subcutaneously. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half -life (t
1/2) values of rAvPAL- PEG administered to - protocol.pdf Page 491

Proprietary and Confidential  
normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_223959] area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) -dose. In the 
cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the t 1/2 was 65  hours at 
4.0 mg/kg, 71  hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest 
dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have similar characteristics. The following fin dings were noted: (1) a 1-compartment model with 
first-order absorption appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL- PEG after 
single -dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after 
SC administration to maximum observed plasma concentration (C
max), along with a long t 1/2, 
(3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) the AUC and the C
max are roughly linearly proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG was assesse d in single -dose and repeat-dose studies in normal 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose rat study, decreased body weight gain and Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the Kupffer cell finding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a 26-week repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and vacuolation of the hist iocytic cells were observed in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. In a 39 -week repeat -dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid nodules in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this 
finding was completely reversed after [ADDRESS_223960] -level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL -PEG when administered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells in the rat and arterial inflammation findings in the monkey.  - protocol.pdf Page 492

7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan® or are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  
This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG 
(Study  PAL -002, Study PAL -004, and Study 165-205) based on data from the completed 
clinic al study, P AL-001, and clinical experience as of JAN2011 from this ongoing study and 
the other ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_223961] of rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations. 
The effectiveness of rAvPAL -PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies of 
ENU2 mice was consistent with what was observed in PAL-001. PAL-001 enrolled 25 PKU 
subjects with a mean (standard deviation; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolled into the study were assigned to receive a single administration of rAvPAL -PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects each received 1  of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL- PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL -001 are summarized as follows: 
• rAvPAL -PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood -lowering 
effect on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  
• For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL- PEG, clinically 
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically 
significant decreases from baseline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3% (mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was 1113 µmol/L.  
• Overall, no clinically significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed in 
subjects who were administered r AvPAL -PEG at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003, 
0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg. - protocol.pdf Page 493
 PAL -003 A4 Page 31 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
• For subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG at the 3  higher dose levels (0.01, 
0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL-PEG concentration levels, the 
calculated PK parameters were a mean T max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/[ADDRESS_223962] igated in three Phase 2 clinical trials (PAL -002 and 
PAL -004). As of May 2012, a total of [ADDRESS_223963] been administered rAvPAL- PEG in a 
rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 study.   
In PAL -002 (A Phase 2, Open- Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU), 
approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled and will be administered multiple doses of rAvPAL -PEG up to 5.0 mg/kg/week. PAL-002 is a 2-part study. In Part 1, subjects will be 
assigned to 1 of 4 rAvPAL-PEG dose cohorts (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.1 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg). rAvPAL -PEG will be administered at a fixed weekly dose of 0.001 mg/kg (Cohort 1), 
0.003 mg/kg (Cohort 2), 0.01 mg/kg (Cohort 3), 1.0 mg/kg (Cohort 4), or 0.1 mg/k g (Part  1 
Substudy) for 8 weeks. In Part 2, all subjects who complete Part 1 will be administered an adjustable dose of rAvPAL-PEG for up to an additional 8 weeks. The dose administered in Part 2 may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189564]/or dose frequency to reach a target blood Phe 
concentration of 60-600 µmol/L.  
Study PAL -003 (Long-Term Extension of a Phase 2, Open- Label, Dose-Finding Study to 
Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects with PKU) is an  extension study of PAL-002, PAL-004 and 165-205 (A 
Phase 2, Multi- Center, Open -Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate Safety, Efficacy and 
Tolerability of Subcutaneously Administered rAvPAL-PEG in Patients with PKU for 24 Weeks). Once subjects have complet ed a previous rAvPAL-PEG study, they have the option 
to enroll into PAL-[ADDRESS_223964] of multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU for up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary 
objectives of the study are (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of multiple d ose levels of rAvPAL-PEG, (2) to evaluate the antibody response to rAvPAL- PEG, - protocol.pdf Page 494
 PAL -003 A4 Page 32 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
and (3) to evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. The study protocol 
was amended (30APR2010) to include a substudy of an additional rAvPAL- PEG dose level 
(0.1 mg/kg/week) that reduced blood Phe concentrations to clinically significant levels in the 
Phase 1 study, PAL-001. The protocol was amended again (28MAR2011) to increase the starting dose for Cohort 4 from 0.03 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week. As of  JAN2011, 
[ADDRESS_223965] been dosed with 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG. Additional information about the safety reported as of 
JAN2011 is provided in Section 7.4.2. 
Study PAL -004 is designed to determine if daily administration of rAvPAL- PEG at  daily 
dose levels (0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day) is safe and effective in reducing and 
maintaining consistent blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. It is hypothesized that 
a higher starting dose and frequency will reduce blood Phe concentrations to near- normal 
levels in a timely manner and will provide the greatest clinical benefit. C onsidering the 
concentration and volume of drug that is administered subcutaneously, the only way to increase the rAvPAL -PEG dose is via daily administration. Therefore, in Study PAL- 004, a 
higher starting dose of 0.4 mg/kg will be administered 5 days a we ek (referred to as daily), a 
dosing regimen that has been observed to be tolerated and to reduce blood Phe concentrations to clinically meaningful levels in previously exposed subjects in this study. Following completion of Study PAL-004, subjects have the option to enroll into this study and to continue to receive doses of rAvPAL-PEG for up to an additional [ADDRESS_223966]-driven dose modification schema to assess 
safety. In addition, fixed dosing at a drug concentration of 15 mg/mL rAvPAL- PEG will be 
assessed.  As of May  2012, enrollment of subjects is underway for this study. 
In this study, subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL-PEG study will continue to be 
administered the same rAvPAL -PEG dose that was administered in the previous study. If the 
safety, PK, and blood Phe concentration results from the previous study indicate that the appropriate level of PEGylation and dosing regimen differs from that administered in the previous study, the PEGylation and/or dosing regimen administered in this study may change.    
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited disease characterized by [CONTACT_189616]. Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North America is born with PKU (Scriver, 2001, McGraw- Hill) . Left untreated, PAH deficiency is associated with an abnormally - protocol.pdf Page 495
 PAL -003 A4 Page 33 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
elevated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr. ) and can 
result in a variety of neuropathologic conditions, including mental retardation, microcephaly, 
delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnorm alities (Scriver, 2001, McGraw- Hill) . The 
brains of untreated patients with PKU show evidence of hypomyelination and gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, 
Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated Phe during fetal development leads to severe mental retardation and 
can cause microcephaly, growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, 
Pediatrics ), (Koch, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Lee, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics ), 
(Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr. ). 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan
® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of PKU involves adherence to low- Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containing foods. Implementation of a Phe-restricted diet in infancy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents many of the neuropathologic manifestations of PKU, including severe mental retardation. However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet ). 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with PKU safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. rAvPAL- PEG is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe 
concentrations, which may have additional clinical benefits.  
Blood Phe levels depend not only on the functional presence of the endogenous enzyme PAH 
but also on the dietary intake of Phe. It is important to understand the role of diet on blood Phe levels concurrent with the administration of rAvPAL- PEG treatment. Therefore, an 
exploratory objective has been added to this study to assess the relationship of diet, rAvPAL -PEG administration, and blood Phe level. Changes to subject diet are not allowed in 
this study unless per the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.     
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of 
rAvPAL -PEG in a minimum of [ADDRESS_223967] already achieved Phe reduction to within the protocol- defined target range.  
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL-PEG studies. Administration of 
rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess whether long-term dosing of rAvPAL- PEG is safe 
and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from previous rAvPAL-PEG studies will change the assumption 
that rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include injection -site reactions and other g eneral symptoms.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_223968] been a few reports of PEG -related AEs in humans; cumulative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, oliguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG 
exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely used medicines and other compounds that are administered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189286] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG- related toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kg 
rAvPAL -PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been assocated with PEG -related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins 
(refer to Section  7.1).  
In this study, subjects will be monitored closely with urine examinations and blood chemistries to follow kidney function. 
7.4.2 Toxicity Due to an Immunologic Reaction 
The active drug substance in rAvPAL- PEG is a bacterial protein, and as such, it is expected 
that it may elicit immune recognition and responses. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the immune 
response may be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab ). In vivo - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223969] shown that PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the 
immunological response (Scott, 1997, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs. ). 
PEGylation has been effective in reducing anti-rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model, although PEGylation does not eliminate antibody formation. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL may have a significant effect on reducing the immunogenicity of the molecule, it is reasonable to expect that some individuals may exhibit immune responses upon exposure to the drug. These immune responses may be clinically irrelevant, cause symptoms of various degrees, or lead to neutralization of biological activit y. Subjects participating in clinical trials 
will be monitored closely with specific antibody titers, sedimentation rates, and complete 
blood counts (CBCs). 
As of May 2012, a total of [ADDRESS_223970] been administered rAvPAL- PEG in the single -
dose, Phase 1 study (PAL-001) and in the repeat -dosing Phase 2 studies (P AL-002, PAL-
004, and PAL-003). The dose levels in the repeat -dosing studies range from 0.001 to 5.0 
mg/k g/week administered in various frequencies (including 5 days a week).  The most 
clinically significant AEs have been hypersensitivity reactions that have led to dosing 
interruptions and reductions. Most of the hypersensitivity reactions have been nonserious and mild-to-moderate in severity.  
A total of [ADDRESS_223971] been reported as related to rAvPAL -PEG. Two of the study- drug related SAEs 
occurred in Study PAL -001. Both of these SAEs occurred in subjects in the lower dose 
cohorts: an SAE of hypersensitivity reaction in a subject in the 0.001 mg/kg cohort and an 
SAE of anaphylactic reaction (urticaria) in a subject in the 0.01 mg/kg cohort . Neither SAE 
was severe or resulted in discontinuation from the study, and both of the SAEs resolved. 
There were no SAEs in subjects in the higher dose cohorts (0.03 mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg) in PAL -001. The third study drug- related SAE (angioedema) occurred in a subject in Study 
PAL -004. The fourth SAE (urti caria, dehydration) was reported as not related to study drug 
and occurred in a subject in Study PAL-002.  There have been no reports of anaphylaxis for any subject treated with rAvPEG -PAL (as of January 2012).  
Subjects who have a systemic clinical reacti on at any time during this study may undergo a 
series of assessments to monitor safety, including assessment of complements, C- reactive 
protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and IgE antibodies.  Reintroduction of rAvPAL -PEG dosing after a reaction will depend on clinical assessments and available 
laboratory data, such as chemistry and urine studies, to ensure that there has been no - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_223972] not been predictive of future clinical 
reactions when dosing with rAvPAL-PEG.  Additionally, subjects will be premedicated to 
prevent or mitigate risk of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3).  
PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.), (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), however, antibodies against PEG may form when PEG is bound to 
compounds. (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.) ,(Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.).  In some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in any significant clinical effects in humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . 
In some individuals, anti-PEG antibodies may be pre-existing due to previous exposure to 
PEG in other products. Anti-PEG antibodies have been associated with nonresponsiveness against therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.).  
Administration of rAvPAL- PEG may lead to anti -PEG antibody formation , and the duration 
of this possible effect is not known. Subjects in the Phase [ADDRESS_223973]’s future ability to be treated with other PEG -containin g (eg,  Depo -Provera) or 
PEGylated (eg,  PEG -interferon) injectable drugs. It is therefore recommended that any 
PEG -containing injectable drug administered to subjects after completion of this study be 
done under medical observation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Skin Reactions  
Two out of 25 subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL- 001 and received the 
protocol-defined single dose of rAvPAL- PEG reported systemic skin reactions (generalized 
skin rash) that were attributed to treatment with study drug. One subject received a single dose of 0.001 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG, and the other subject received a single dose of 
0.01 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG. One of these events was reported as serious, and the other was 
reported as nonserious; both events were reported following administration of Depo- Provera  
injections (medroxyprogesterone injection), an injectable contraception. These allergic reactions are thought to be related to the PEG molecules that are found in both the study drug, rAvPAL -PEG, and Depo-Provera. These reactions are not likely to be expe rienced 
concurrent with other birth control medications. 
The [ADDRESS_223974]; however, no 
further reactions or complications were reported following subsequent administration of a full dose of Depo-Provera. Upon study completion, the subject continued to receive regular doses (every 3 months) of Depo-Provera, and no further reactions were reported. The second subject also had a positive reaction to Depo- Provera following administr ation of the skin 
prick test. When a subsequent full dose of Depo-Provera was administered,  developed hives, itching, and chills. The subject’s symptoms resolved within [ADDRESS_223975] basis for these reported events and their duration is not known, 
the use of PEG-containing injectable drugs prior to, during, and after this study is prohibited as a precautionary measure (refer to Section  9.3.2 and Section 9.4.8).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Allergic Reactions 
Allergic reactions to the SC injection of rAvPAL -PEG may be mild, moderate , or severe in 
intensity. Reactions may include pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or anaphylaxis. Clinical asses sments should be conducted for a minimum of 30-[ADDRESS_223976]-injection. Longer observations may be required at the discretion of the PI. The responsible physician should use all appropriate measures for the treatment of allergic 
reactions. Because of the  small potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for emergency 
resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be within easy access during and after the - protocol.pdf Page 500

Proprietary and Confidential  
rAvPAL -PEG injection. Subjects who qualify for self administration of study drug will be 
provided with emergency resuscitation instructions (refer to Section  9.[ADDRESS_223977] 
Self-Administration Training Materials).  
In the event of an allergic reaction, subjects may be asked to see an allergist/immunologist 
and/or provide up to 3 additional blood samples for immunology studies and complement testing. This additional testing may occur up to 6 months following the final study visit.   
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of allergic symptoms:  
• Maintain the airway.  
• Vital sign check.  
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. 
• Administration of oral or IV glucocorticoids. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment (eg, acetaminiophen or 
ibuprofen). 
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center.  
In addition, clinical judgment must be used in determining the appropriateness of 
corticosteroid administration. An allergy and/or immunology consultation should be sought if necessary. Information regarding the management of local skin, large local skin, and systemic reactions is provided in Section  9.1.1. Detailed instructions for the management of 
allergic reactions are provided in the Study Reference Manual.  - protocol.pdf Page 501

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in approximately 100 subjects 
with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested in PAL -002 and 
PAL -004 (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week), provided no dose- limiting toxicity was 
observed in a previous rAvPAL-PEG studies. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL- PEG s tudy will be enrolled into this study. 
Subjects enrolling into PAL-[ADDRESS_223978] their starting dose determined per the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  The first dose will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_223979] be made per the In vestigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer 
and must be performed under the supervision of the Investigator in consultation with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Officer. To monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet diary will be issued to subject s for completion and will be brought to clinic monthly for review with the clinical 
study staff.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_81920]’s Medical Officer and if adequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set 
of criteria to be considered appropriate for self administration. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_223980] Self- Administration Training Materials.  
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NC I) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), version 4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of 
subjects in the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor. - protocol.pdf Page 503

PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’previous rAvPAL-PEG dosing will continue in PAL-003. In PAL-
003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or maintain blood Phe 
concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a subject’s 
weight or will be a fixed dose (subjects who have maintained blood Phe levels to 60-600 
µmol/L for at least [ADDRESS_223981] 2 consecutive weeks; refer to Section  9.4.4). Doses will be evaluated on an 
individual basis.  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 9.1.[ADDRESS_223982] ’s blood Phe concentration has been 
controlled to within a target range (60 -600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have 
additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 60 visit. 
• The study is terminated.  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subj ects may 
also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to have them complete th e study assessments as scheduled 
as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety. 
A PK substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_223983] additional pre- dose PK sampling performed (refer to 
Table 9.1.2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects Who Have Had Previous Hypersensitivity Reactions to rAvPAL -PEG or a PEG -containing Product  
Subjects who had a previous systemic reaction to rAvPAL- PEG or a PEG -containing product 
that warranted early termination from a previous rAvPAL -PEG study are  excluded from 
participation in this study. Subjects who experienced a generalized skin rash are included in this category. Subjects who have had a previous local skin reaction to rAvPAL- PEG in a 
previous rAvPAL- PEG study are eligible to participate in this study. Subjects who have had 
a previous reaction and are deemed eligible for participation must be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or non- sedating antihistamines [ADDRESS_223997] is accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).  
Subjects may develop systemic, large 
local skin, or local skin reactions after enr ollment in PAL -003. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
definitions of systemic and local skin reactions. For management of hypersensitivity reactions that  occur during this study, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Reaction and Hypersensitivity Reactions to rAvPAL- PEG 
Administered Subcutaneously  
During Study PAL-003, subjects may experience hypersensitivity reactions to rAvPAL- PEG. 
The hypersensitivity reactions are defined as follows:  
Local skin reaction: 
• Skin signs or symptoms in 1 affected primary location, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling 
or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site of injection.  
Large local skin reaction: - protocol.pdf Page 511
 PAL -003 A4 Page 49 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
• Skin signs or symptoms, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, 
redness, or induration with pain or itching that extends beyond the site of injection by 
[CONTACT_3450] 6 inches (15 cm) and/or signs or symptoms that are not contiguous to the injection site.  These may be associated with a low risk of systemic symptoms or 
anaphylaxis upon re- exposure and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction 
when not contiguous to the injection site.  
Systemic reaction (including generalized skin symptoms): 
• Skin and non-skin signs or symptoms in more than 1 affected primary location, 
ie, cutaneous reaction in more than 1 area and/or anaphylaxis or any other generalized 
symptoms, such as hypotension, angioedema or the involvement of other organ 
systems, eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_83731], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological; and/or a fever 
attributed to treatment with rAvPAL -PEG (  ≥ 100.4°F or  ≥ 38°C). 
For management of hypersensitivity reactions that occur during this study, refer to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Local Skin Reactions 
All subjects who experience a local skin reaction during this study may be premedicated 
orally with acetaminophen and/or non- sedating antihistamines 1 -2 hours prior to study drug 
dosing (subjects may take non- sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all 
future study doses. Recommended premedications are acetaminophen and/or non- sedating 
antihistamine. The dosage will be standard. Because antihistamines can cause drowsiness, sedating antihistamines may be administered only if the subject is accompanied by a designated driver. Symptoms of local reactions may be treated with local application of ice and non- sedating oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_189327]/or topic al steroids (refer to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If the local skin reaction worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_116333]’s Medical Officer) even with premedication prior to study drug dosing, the subject must be withdrawn from study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Large Local Skin Reactions 
Large local skin reactions (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition) may or may not be 
contiguous to the rAvPAL- PEG injection site, and subjects with either type of large local 
skin reaction may continue dosing if the skin symptoms have resolved and no other 
symptoms have developed. Subjects will be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or non-sedating antihistamines 1 -2 hours prior to study drug dosing (subjects may take non-
sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) fo r all future study doses. 
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as needed (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_223998] developed. For the remainder of the study, subjects will be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or non- sedating antihistamines 1 -2 hours prior to study drug dosing

Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as needed (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.2 Large Local Skin Reactions Not Contiguous to Injection Site 
Large local skin reactions that are not contiguous to the injection site may be associated with a low risk of systemic symptoms or anaphylaxis upon re-exposure to rAvPAL-PEG and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3). An example of 
a large local reaction th at is not contiguous to the injection site is if an injection took place in 
the right upper arm and there are lesions beyond the elbow joint in the right forearm or lesions beyond the shoulder joint on the right trunk. 
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as needed (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Systemic Reactions  
Subjects who experience a systemic reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for a definition) after 
administration of rAvPAL-PEG must stop further administrations of rAvPAL-PEG and must immediately return to the clinic for safety assessments. Subjects who experience generalized skin symptoms are included in this category. Immediately after the systemic reaction (within 
48 hours), subjects with generalized skin symptoms must have additional assessments performed for safety (ie, Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit): serum antibodies (anti-PAL IgG, anti- PAL IgM, anti -PEG IgG, anti- PEG IgM, anti rAvPAL -PEG IgE, 
anti-rAvPAL -PEG neutralizing antibodies); serum tryptase level (it is recommended that this 
sample be drawn immediately after reaction); sedimentation rate; CRP, CH50, C
1, C3, and 
C4; skin biopsy (optional; affected and not affected area; to be performed within 1 week of 
reaction); and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology; refer to Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1.  
Following the reaction, subjects will be required to complete the assessments of the Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction visit, including assessment of IgE. If a subject presents with a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, further dosing will be held while laboratory evaluation of IgE, as part of the Unscheduled Systemic Reaction Visit, is performed.  Subjects who do not have an IgE- mediated reaction may resume study drug administration 
per the discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s Medical Officer; however, 
if subject was dosing at home, they will be required to come into the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_223999] experienced an IgE-mediated reaction, dosing - protocol.pdf Page 515

will not resume until review of th e case with the Investigator, Sponsor ’s Medical Officer, and 
an allergist/immunologist.   
rAvPAL -PEG administration will resume at the next lowest dose level. Restarting of 
rAvPAL -PEG administration following a systemic reaction must be performed in the clinic 
for the first week of resumed dosing. Subjects must be premedicated orally with 
acetaminophen and/or antihistamines 1-2 hours prior to study drug dosing (subjects may take 
non-sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all future study dos es. 
Additionally, subjects must be closely monitored for 30-[ADDRESS_224000] be accompanied by  a designated driver (if applicable) .   
If blood Phe concentrations are not 60-600 µmol/L following 1  week of daily administration 
at the lowered dose cohort and there is no further evidence of toxicity (ie, another systemic reaction attributed to rAvPAL -PEG administration or clinically significant abnormal 
laborat ory test results), the  subject may be administered the next highest dose level in the 
clinic per the allowable dose increases outlined in Section  9.1.2. Subjects must be 
premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or antihistamines 1-2 hours prior to study drug dosing (subjects may take non- sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all 
future study doses. Additionally, subjects must be closely monitored for 30-[ADDRESS_224001] be accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).  
9.1.2 Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology  
Each subject’s do se may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator, in agreement 
with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on a 
subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations. 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224002]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follow s: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. - protocol.pdf Page 516
 PAL -003 A4 Page 54 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 
0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,  1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, a nd 5.0 mg/kg)  
or per Investigator determination in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction) fo r an individual subject. 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg.  Subjects who increase their dose frequency should perform the Interim Dosing Visit assessments (refer to Section  
12.3.6 and 
Table 9.1.1).  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for 30-[ADDRESS_224003] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do 
not need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase t he overall weekly dose amount. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical 
Officer. Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse event (any hypersensitivity reaction as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie, any adverse 
event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose). 
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 
0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required to attain the target Phe concentration, dosing frequency may be reduced.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L as 
measured by [CONTACT_189614] a minimum of 1 month), the subject’s rAvPAL-PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224004] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician). - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224005]’s data will be evaluated by [CONTACT_189566] (PI) and the Sponsor’s Medical Officer, and a decisio n will then be 
made whether to discontinue the subject from the study treatment, restart dosing at the same 
dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level. 
9.1.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_42224] 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit toxicity of a treatment- emergent CTCAE grade 3 
or greater or a systemic reaction that is assessed as related to treatment with study drug, 
further dosing of subjects at that dose level will evaluated and a safety assessment will be completed. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be notified of this occurrence if appropriate.

9.3.3 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or Assessment  
Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study or to receive study drug at any time without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw from the study or study drug treatment any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible, a subject who is discontinued from study treatment should continue to perform the study tests and evaluations until study completion. For subjects who discontinue from the study, the tests and evaluations listed for the Early Termination Visit should be carried out (refer to Section  12.4).  
BioMarin must be notified of all subject withdrawals as soon as possible. BioMarin also reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for either clinical or administrative reasons and to discontinue participation by [CONTACT_189617] t or noncompliance. 
Reasons for which the Investigator or BioMarin may withdraw a subject from the study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Subject experiences a serious or intolerable adverse event (AE).

BioMarin and/or its designee will provide the study site or subject with a supply of IP sufficient for the completion of the study. BioMarin is responsible for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_189350]. The clinical site is responsible for supplying the study drug to subjects who qualify for self administration. Refer to the PAL -[ADDRESS_224013] (IP) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Product Ch aracteristics and Labeling  
The rAvPAL-PEG drug product for SC injection is formulated and supplied as a sterile aqueous (colorless to pale yellow) solution in clear, single-use, type- 1 borosilicate glass 
vials. Each 3  mL vial contains 1.5 ±  0.2 mL to deliver either 10 mg of rAvPAL- PEG per 
1 mL (10  mg/mL protein concentration) or 15 mg of rAvPAL-PEG per 1 mL (15 mg/mL 
protein concentration). Each vial is filled with 1.5 ±  0.[ADDRESS_224014] be stored at 5 ± 3°C (41  ± 5°F) under the conditions specified in the IB. At the 
site, the IP will be stored in a secure area accessible only to the designated pharmacists and 
clinical site personnel. All IP must be stored and inventoried and the inventories must be carefully and accurately documented according to applicable state, federal and local regulations, ICH GCP, and study procedures. 
Specific instructions for storage of study drug for subjects who qualify for self administration 
are provided in the Subject Self- Administration Training Materials.

[CONTACT_189441], dose frequency, or both, as agreed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s Medical Officer, based upon the subject’s response to doses. Dosing is up to a maximum dose per week of 5.0 mg/kg (or 375 mg for subjects receiving a fixed dose).  
For subjects receiving weight-based dosing, dosage is calculated by [CONTACT_189621]’s weight in kilograms (kg) on Day 1 (predose) by [CONTACT_189455] (in mg/kg). During the study, if the weight of a subject changes more than 10% from the measurement obtained at baseline or at a previous measurement, the subject’s dose may be adjusted to accommodate the change. The change must be recorded. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information on calculating dosage. 
Subjects wh o have demonstrated efficacy (as measured by [CONTACT_189622] 60-600 µmol/L for at least 2 consecutive weeks) and who have maintained a stable 
rAvPAL -PEG dose for at least 2 consecutive weeks may be eligible to transition from 
weight -based dosing to a fixed dosing regimen that would permit daily dosing (5- or 7 -days-
per-week).  Subjects who convert to a fixed-dosing regimen should convert their dose based 
upon the information presented in Table [IP_ADDRESS]. - protocol.pdf Page 524

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., 
sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study- drug or other 
protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577].  
• Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions (eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment run -
in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study- drug and the AE.  
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
The study period during which all non-serious AEs and SAEs will be reported begins after informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug  and continues until [ADDRESS_224032] visit of the treatment period (refer to Section 12). After informed consent but prior to initiation of study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 10.2.   
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record. 
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AE s 
for severity, relationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see  Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to 
seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224033]’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed accor ding to the general 
guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of 
daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48622]; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily 
living (ADL)  
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent 
intervention indicatedb 
5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the 
toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.

on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to the IP has not occurred 
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use 
of the IP; that is, there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP. 
Possibly 
Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189578]. 
Probably 
Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189626].  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189580], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology).

Proprietary and Confidential  
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1 
or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life threatening.  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event or reaction. 
The reporting period for SAEs begins after informed consent is obtained, and continues until 
[ADDRESS_224035] be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event by [CONTACT_189581] -specific S AE Report Form to 
BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). ). Each SAE must also be reported in the CRF Investigators should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463].  The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study 
treatment or participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented in the CRF and in the subject’s medical record.  
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate 
the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report). - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224036]’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation if felt to be related to prior study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator should becom e aware 
of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that participated in this study.  
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation must be obtained by [CONTACT_189627].

IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for these events which may 
require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
• Immediate need to revise the IP administration (i.e., modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol). 
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management. 
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety requirements.

13 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
BioMarin personnel or designees will visit the study site prior to initiation of the study to 
review with the site personnel information about the IP, protocol and other regulatory document requirements, any applicable randomization procedures, source document requirements, CRFs, monitoring requirements, and procedures for reporting AEs, including SAEs.  
At visits during and after the study, a CRA will monitor the site for compliance with regulatory documentation, with a focus on accurate and complete recording of data on CRFs from source documents, adherence to protocol, randomization (if applicable), SAE reporting and drug accountability records.  
The designated clinical data management group will enter or transfer CRF data into a study 
database.  
Data quality control and analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_189468] a designee, based on a predefined analysis plan. - protocol.pdf Page 550

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF  SAMPLE SIZE 
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency and percent, while continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical analysis.  
14.[ADDRESS_224052] postdose safety information will be included in the safety analyses. 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. A by–subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a serious AE (SAE), including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study drug. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. Frequency and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference range) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post-treatment visits. Changes from baseline to the post-
treatmen t visits will also be provided. Descriptive statistics, including clinically significant 
changes from baseline, of vital signs, ECG results, and X-ray results will also be provided. 
14.[ADDRESS_224053] the following PK parameters assessed: area 
under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC), time to maximum plasma concentration 
(T
max), maximum plasma concentration (C max), half life ( t1/2), and clearance (CL/F) .  Should 
data become available from previous rAvPAL- PEG studies that indicate study drug 
accumulation should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added for PK analysis as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224054]- treatment efficacy data will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, an d maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration 
from baseline to each scheduled time point and presence/absence of antibodies will also be summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L will be summarized by [CONTACT_189515]. 
The relationship of dietary Phe intake (per information reported on the subject diet diary) and 
blood Phe concentration will also be explored. Subjects who received any amount of study drug with any post- treatment blood Phe concentration measurements and diet diary 
information will be included in this exploratory analysis. Information regarding this exploratory analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
For subjects who completed the Substudy, the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189329]- starting rAvPAL -
PEG dosing on safety, blood Phe level, and immune response will be explored. Information regarding the analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
14.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Subjects who participated in previous rAvPAL-PEG studies may be enrolled into this study. 
No formal sample size calculation was conducted for this study or the PAL-003 Substudy.   
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
All analyses will be presented based on observed data only. Missing dat a will not be imputed 
for analyses unless sensitivity analyses are warranted. If imputations are used, detailed 
imputation methods will be described in the SAP before locking the database. 
14.7 Interim Analyses  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study on an ongoing basis (refer to Section 15 for 
information regarding the DMC). - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224055]’s safety is compromised without immediate action. In these 
circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB must be sought, and the Investigator should inform BioMarin and the full IRB within [ADDRESS_224056] receive approval from the IRB prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to subjects, the ICF will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_189628], and all active subjects mus t again provide informed consent. 
Note: If discrepancies exist between the text of the statistical analysis as planned in the protocol, and the final SAP, a protocol amendment will not be issued and the SAP will prevail.  - protocol.pdf Page 553

15 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE (DMC)  
The DMC will act independently in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the safety 
of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who participate in the study. Meetings of the DMC can be 
convened at any time at the discretion of the DMC Chair or the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
The Chair will be notified by [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Officer of all SAEs and will receive 
summaries of other safety data as available. The DMC will review the study data as soon as it 
is available during the study, on a schedule defined in the DMC Charter, and offer advice on whether or not to proceed, modify or terminate study enrollment on the basis of toxicity. Details regarding the DMC membership and safety data to be reviewed by [CONTACT_189470] a charter. 
The responsibilities of the DMC a re to:  
• Review the study protocol, informed consent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, subjects’ risk versus benefit, and other factors that could affect the study outcome. 
• Consider relevant information that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189370]  9.1.4. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224057]’ s disease, that are not part of this study. Costs associated with 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre- specified medical i nstitution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for study- related injuries. 
The treating physic ian should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531], if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_187697]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224058] be completed using a web–based application that has been validated. Study site personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will correct the value by [CONTACT_189629]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the site personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of  the correction, and 
the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If an Investigator or institution refuses to allow access to subject records because of confidentiality, arrangements must be made to allow an “interview” style of data verification. 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189630] “source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, all data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying that the information on the CRFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, will then - protocol.pdf Page 556

set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the 
clinical study report for the entire study, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224059] the monitors. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_189371].

a clinical site at any time during or after completion of the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_189372] d if 
an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory Agencies may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_189299]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_189300], study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224060] notify BioMarin of any change in the location, disposition or custody of the study files. The PI/institution must take measures to pre vent accidental or 
premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (e.g., subject charts) as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_25435].  
All study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_224061] approval of a marketing application in the U.S. or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the [LOCATION_002] or an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_224062] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The PI/institution should retain subjec t identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_224063] with retention should the PI/institution be unable to continue ma intenance of 
subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to inform the PI/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224064] poly(ethylene

Section No./Title  Revision  Rationale  
Section 2/Synopsis, Study 
Rationale  … This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies PAL -002, PAL -004, and 165- 205the dose finding 
studies (Study PAL 002 and Study PAL 004). Administration of rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess whether 
long-term dosing of rAvPAL -PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects.  
Because rAvPAL PEG is being assessed as a long term chronic treatment for patients with PKU, there is a need t o 
understand the effect of a temporary dosing interruption on the safety, efficacy (blood Phe), PK, and immune response. 
Therefore, a Substudy has been added to this study to assess the effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189375] w ho are on a variety of rAvPAL PEG dosing regimens (dose level and frequency). Up to 
10 subjects who are on a variety of dosing regimens (dose level and frequency) in this study are eligible for participation 
in the Substudy and will stop dosing for a perio d of approximately 4  weeks. During this dosing interruption, subjects 
will be assessed for safety, efficacy, PK, and immune response and will continue to perform the scheduled study 
assessments.   
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in a minimum of [ADDRESS_224069] already achieved Phe reduction to within 
the protocol -defined target range.  5, 6, 16  - protocol.pdf Page 565

Section 2/Synopsis, Objectives  The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To assess evaluate the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration following 
administration  with rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows:  
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who have achieved and maintained target blood Phe 
concentration and for whom no further dose modifications are planned.  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189376] a subset of subjects 
with PKU.  
• To evaluate the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189377] a subset 
of subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate  the effect of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189378] a subset of 
subjects with PKU.   
• To assess the effect of multiple doses of rAvPAL PEG on the PK profile, in particular clearance of drug, when 
drug is stopped in a subset of su bjects with PKU who have been previously exposed to rAvPAL PEG.    5, 6, 16  - protocol.pdf Page 566

Section 2/Synopsis, Study Design 
and Plan  This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies the Phase 2, open label, dose finding studies, PAL 002 
and PAL 004, in approximately 100 subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested in 
PAL -002 and PAL -004 (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week), provided no dose -limiting toxicity is observed in a 
PAL [ADDRESS_224070] their 
starting dose determined per the Sponsor’s Medical O fficer.  Subjects who enroll from PAL [ADDRESS_224071] be made per the 
Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer and must be performed under the supervision of the 
Investigaor Investigator  in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. To monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet 
diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be reviewed with the clinical stud y staff on a monthly basis .  
 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take rAvPAL -PEG. PAL 002 
and PAL 004 Subjects’ previous subjects’ rAvPAL -PEG dosing will continue in PAL -003. In PAL -003, each subject’s 
dose will be adjusted as needed to attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 60- 600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose 
will be based on either a subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose (subjects who have maintained blood Phe levels to 
60-600 µmol/L for at least  [ADDRESS_224072] 2 
consecutive weeks). Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.

Section 2/Synopsis, Study Design 
and Plan  PAL -[ADDRESS_224073] rAvPAL PEG administration halted for approximately 4 weeks regardless of their dosing re gimen 
(dose level and frequency). rAvPAL PEG will not be administered during the dose interruption; however, subjects will 
continue to perform assessments for safety, blood Phe concentration, PK, and immune response. Subjects enrolled into 
the Substudy wil l also have additional PK sampling performed prior to the dosing interruption and during the dosing 
interruption. To allow for PK sampling once dosing is stopped, subjects may be admitted to a research facility within [ADDRESS_224074] week after the dosing interruption.  5, 6 
Section 2/Synopsis, Dose Increase Methodology  For subjects from PAL [ADDRESS_224075]’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day  [ADDRESS_224076]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows.  
• Only 1 dose  (level or frequency) adjustment is a llowed every 2 weeks.  
• Blood Phe levels will be measured daily for 3 days after each dose increase (fingerstick is acceptable); more 
frequent or daily blood Phe measurements may be performed.

Decrease Methodology  If the subje ct develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L as measured by [CONTACT_189614] 
a minimum of 1 month), the subject’s rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition 
persists after another [ADDRESS_224077] may be asked to consult the dietician 
to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas a nd to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard 
of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician).

Section 7.2/Previous Clinical 
Studies  The rAvPAL -PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of 
rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan® or 
are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment. This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with 
rAvPAL -PEG (Study  PAL -002,andStudy PAL -004, and Study 165- 205) based on data from the completed clinical 
study, PAL -001, and clinical experience to date as of (JAN2011)  from this ongoing study and the other ongoing Phase 2 
studiesy, PAL -002 and PAL -004.

Section 7.2.2/Phase 2 Studies PAL -002, PAL -004, and 165-205
 Currently, rAvPAL -PEG is being investigated in two three  Phase 2 clinical trials (PAL -002 and PAL -004). To date 
(JAN2011) As of May [ADDRESS_224080] for Study PAL 004.   
Study PAL -003 (Long- Term Extension of a Phase 2, Open -Label, Dose- Findi ng Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL -PEG in Subjects with PKU) is an extension study of PAL -
002,and PAL -004, and 165- 205 (A Phase 2, Multi -Center, Open -Label, Dose- Finding Study to Evaluate Sa fety, Efficacy 
and Tolerability of Subcutaneously Administered rAvPAL -PEG in Patients with PKU for 24 Weeks) . Once subjects 
have completed Study PAL [ADDRESS_224081] the option to enroll into PAL -
003 and to continue t o receive doses of rAvPAL -PEG for up to an additional 60 months.  
…. The protocol was amended again (28MAR2011) to increase the starting dose for Cohort 4 from 0.03 mg/kg/week to 
1.0 mg/kg/week. To date ( As of  JAN2011) , [ADDRESS_224082] been dosed with 0.1  mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG. Additional information about the safety reported as of  to date 
(JAN2011)  is provided in Section  7.4.[ADDRESS_224083] -driven dose modification schema to assess safety. In addition, fixed 
dosing at a drug concentration of 15 mg/mL rAvPAL -PEG will be assessed. As of May 2012, enrollment of subjects is 
underway for this study.  
In this study, subjects inwho completed a previous rAvPAL -PEG study  PAL 002 and PAL 004 will continue to be 
administered the same rAvPAL -PEG dose that was administered in the previous study PAL 002 or PAL 004. If the 
safety, PK, and blood Phe concentration results from the previous study either PAL 002 or PAL 004 indicate that the 
appropriate level of PEGylation and dosing regimen differs from that administered in the previous study PAL 002 or 
PAL 004, the PEGylation and/or dosing regimen administered in this study may change.

Section 7.3/Study Rationale  Because rAvPAL PEG is being assessed as a long term chronic treatment for patients with PKU, there is a need to 
understand the effect of a temporary dosing interruption on the safety, efficacy (blood Phe), PK, and immune response. 
To date (JAN2011), there is limited information on the effects of a rAvPAL PEG dose interruption in subjects with 
PKU. Therefore, a Substudy has been added to this study to assess the effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189381] a variety of rAvPAL PEG dosing regimens (dose level and frequency). Up to 
10 subjects who are on a variety of dosing regimens (dose level and frequency ) in this study are eligible for participation 
in the Substudy and will stop dosing for a period of approximately 4  weeks. During this dosing interruption, subjects 
will be assessed for safety, efficacy, PK, and immune response and will continue to perform  the scheduled study 
assessments. There is no information regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of rAvPAL PEG when blood Phe 
levels are at 60 600 µmol/L for subjects on a multiple dose regimen. To address this lack of information, additional PK 
sampli ng will be performed prior to the dosing interruption. Upon restarting rAvPAL PEG, PK sampling will also be 
performed to allow for collection of drug exposure data (area under the plasma concentration time curve [AUC] and 
maximum plasma concentration [C max]), absorption rate, and clearance for subjects who have been previously exposed 
to rAvPAL PEG in this Substudy. This information will allow for comparisons to be performed with subjects who were 
naïve to previous rAvPAL PEG treatment from the Phase  1 stud y, PAL 001.

Section 7.3/Study Rationale  A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in a minimum of [ADDRESS_224084] already achieved Phe reduction to within 
the protocol -defined target range.  
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL -PEG thethe dose finding studies (PAL 002 and  PAL 004). 
Admi nistration of rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess whether long -term dosing of rAvPAL -PEG is safe and can 
maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects.

Section 7.4/Summary of Overall 
Risks and Benefits  It is not expected that data from previous rAvPAL -PEG studies  PAL 002 or PAL 004 will change the assumption that 
rAvPAL -PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non -human enzymes currently in use….  16 - protocol.pdf Page 573

Section 7.4.2/Toxicity Due to an 
Immunologic Reaction  As of May 2012, a total of [ADDRESS_224085] been administered rAvPAL -PEG in the single -dose, Phase 1 study (PAL -
001) and in the repeat -dosing Phase 2 studies (PAL -002, PAL -004, and PAL -003).  The dose levels in the repeat -dosing 
studies range from 0.001 t o 5.0 mg/kg/week administered in various frequencies (including 5 days a week).  The most 
clinically significant AEs have been hypersensitivity reactions that have led to dosing interruptions and reductions. Most 
of the hypersensitivity reactions have been  nonserious and mild -to-moderate in severity.  
A total of [ADDRESS_224086] been reported as 
related to rAvPAL -PEG.  Two of the study- drug related SAEs occurred in Study PAL -001.  Both of  these SAEs 
occurred in subjects in the lower dose cohorts: an SAE of hypersensitivity reaction in a subject in the 0.001  mg/kg 
cohort and an SAE of anaphylactic reaction (urticaria) in a subject in the 0.01  mg/kg cohort.  Neither SAE was severe or 
resulte d in discontinuation from the study, and both of the SAEs resolved.  There were no SAEs in subjects in the higher 
dose cohorts (0.03 mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg) in PAL- 001.  The third study drug -related SAE (angioedema) occurred in a 
subject in Study PAL -004.  The  fourth SAE (urticaria, dehydration) was reported as not related to study drug and 
occurred in a subject in Study PAL -002.  There have been no reports of anaphylaxis for any subject treated with 
rAvPEG -PAL (as of January 2012).  
 15 
Section 7.4.2/Toxicity  Due to an 
Immunologic Reaction  Subjects who have a systemic clinical reaction at any time during this study may undergo a series of assessments to 
monitor safety, including assessment of complements, C -reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rat e (ESR), 
and IgE antibodies.  Reintroduction of rAvPAL -PEG dosing after a reaction will depend on clinical assessments and 
available laboratory data, such as chemistry and urine studies, to ensure that there has been no end -organ damage prior 
to resuming t reatment with rAvPAL -PEG. As of May 2012, antibody titers, including positive IgE titers, have not been 
predictive of future clinical reactions when dosing with rAvPAL -PEG.  Additionally, subjects will be premedicated to 
prevent or mitigate risk of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].3 ). 
In Study PAL 001, there were 11 subjects (out of 25 subjects in the study) with skin related reac tions (injection site 
bruising, erythema, pain, rash, swelling, and urticaria) that occurred following the single administration of rAvPAL
PEG. For all of these subjects, the reactions were generalized skin reactions or injection site skin reactions that d id not 
compromise other organs and were not life threatening. These suspected antibody mediated responses were nonserious 
and mild or moderate in severity. These subjects are not considered to be at significant risk for antibody mediated 
reactions with inj ection of rAvPAL PEG during PAL 002, PAL 004, or this study; however, specific precautions for 
these subjects will be taken during this study to monitor subject safety (refer to Section 9.1.1 ). 
In Study PAL 002, [ADDRESS_224087] been dosed to date (JAN2011), including at dose levels of 2.0  mg/kg/week (or 0.4 
mg/kg/5 days a week). Most reactions reported in these subjects have been nonserious and mild  or moderate in severity. 
There has been 1 SAE reported to date; the event was reported as not related to treatment with study drug. There have 
been no reports of anaphylaxis to date (JAN2011). Subjects who have a systemic reaction during this study will u ndergo 
a series of assessments to monitor safety, including assessment of IgE antibodies,   1, 15  - protocol.pdf Page 574

and will be monitored closely for safety (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].3  for additional information regarding continued 
treatment of subje cts with systemic reactions during the study).  
…. In  some individuals, anti -PEG antibodies may be pre -existing due to previous exposure to PEG in other products. 
Anti-PEG antibodies have been associated with nonresponsiveness against therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer) , (Ganson, 
2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.).  Administration of rAvPAL -PEG may lead to anti -PEG antibody formation, and the duration 
of this possible effect is not known. Subjects in the Phase [ADDRESS_224088]’s future ability to be treated with other 
PEG -containing (eg,  Depo -Provera) or PEGylated (eg,  PEG -interferon) injectable drugs. It is therefore recommended 
that any PEG -containing injectable drug administered to subjects after completion of this study be done under medical 
observation.

Section [IP_ADDRESS]/Management of 
Allergic Reac tions  In the event of an allergic reaction, subjects may be asked to see an allergist/immunologist and/or provide up to 3 additional blood samples for antibody testing
immunology studies and complement testing . This additional testing may 
occur up to 6 mont hs following the final study visit.   
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of allergic symptoms:  
• Administration of oral or IV glucocorticoids  
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids.  
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment ( eg, acetaminiophen or ibuprofen ). 
In addition, clinical judgment must be used in determining the appropriateness of corticosteroid administration. 
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (5 10 mg/kg) may also be administered. An allergy and/or immunology consultation 
should be sought if necessary. Information regarding the management of local skin, large local skin, and systemic 
reactions is provided in Section  9.1.1 . Detailed instructions for the management of allergic reactions are provided in the 
Study Reference Manual.

and PAL 004, in approximately 100 subjects with PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those tested in 
PAL -002 and PAL -004 (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week), provided no dose -limiting toxicity is observed in a 
PAL [ADDRESS_224089] their 
starting dose determined per the Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  Subjects who enroll from PAL [ADDRESS_224090] be made per the 
Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer and must be performed under the supervision of the 
Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Med ical Officer. To monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet diary will 
be issued to subjects for completion and will be brought to each clinic monthly visit for review with the clinical study 
staff.  
 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of s ubjects who are continuing to take rAvPAL -PEG. 
Subjects’previous rAvPAL -PEG dosing will continue in PAL -003. In PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as 
needed to attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 60- 600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be  based on either a 
subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose (subjects who have maintained blood Phe levels to 60 -600 µmol/L for at least [ADDRESS_224091] 2 consecutive weeks; refer to 
Section  9.4.4). Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.

Methodology  For subjects from PAL 002An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224105]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows:  
Only 1 dose (level or frequency)  adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks.  
Blood Phe levels will be measured daily for 3 days after each dose increase (fingerstick is acceptable); more frequent or 
daily blood Phe measurements may be perfo rmed.  
 2, 7 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]/Dose Decrease Methodology  If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L as measured by [CONTACT_189614] 
a minimum of 1 month), the subject’s rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition 
persists after another [ADDRESS_224106] may be asked to  consult the dietician 
to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard 
of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician).

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY  
Ame ndme nt: 5  
 
Date : February 2 8, 2014 
 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The protocol for Study PAL-003 is b eing amended to make the f ollowing change s: 
 
1. Study Duration : The PAL -[ADDRESS_224123] Population : The study population has been revised to only include subjects 
who are on a stable rAvPAL -PEG  dosing regimen  of  < 70 mg/week or 
 > 350 mg/week. This study  is intended to provide long- term access to rAvPAL -PEG  
until study termination or regulatory approval for subjects who are not eligible to 
transition into  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study, 165-302. Subjects who 
are on a stable rAvPAL -PEG  dose regimen of  ≥ 70 mg/week to  ≤ 350 mg/week and 
do not transition to 165-302 will be withdrawn from this study. 
3. Consultation by [CONTACT_2728]’s Medical Officer for Diet and Dose Modifications : Review 
and approval of diet and dose modifications by [CONTACT_456]’s medical officer is no longer required for this study , except for dose increases 
 > 350 mg/week . Significant 
modifications to dose and/or diet are not expected as subjects are generally on a stable maintenance rAvPAL -PEG dose regimen and are no longer performing dose titration.  
4. Observation Time  following Dose Increases or Dose Interruption : The observation 
period following an increase in rAvPAL -PEG  dose or re-introduction of 
rAvPAL -PEG  following a dose interruption has been reduced to [ADDRESS_224124] not proven to be useful. 
5. Clinic Visits : Clinic visits have been reduced from weekly to monthly because it is 
anticipated that rAvPAL -PEG dose adjustments will be infrequent (subjects are on a 
maintenance dose regimen)  and to lessen patient burden. However, w eekly telephone 
contacts will continue to be performed.  Also, blood sampling for PK and 
immunogenicity assessment s has been revised from monthly to every 12  weeks  to 
better align with the long- term needs of this study  and to lessen patient burden . - protocol.pdf Page 597
 PAL -003 A5 Page 3 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
6. Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit : Assessments of urine/albumin 
creatinine ratio and urine N- methyl histamine have been added and sedimentation rate 
has been removed to align with the Hypersensitivity Reaction visit assessments 
performed in the Phase 3 studies. In addition, the window for the Hypersensitivity 
Reaction Visit has been changed to within  24 hours of event onset to enable timely 
assessment of hypersensitivity markers. 
7. Immunogenicity Testing: Antibody testing has been clarified. Anti -PAL 
immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing  is no longer required for this study because there has 
been no observed association between anti-PAL IgE and hypersensitivity reactions.  
Anti-PAL -PEG IgE testing will continue to be performed as part of the 
Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit assessments.  
8. Safety Analysis : Details regarding analysis of hypersensitivity adverse events (AEs), 
including those that result in dose modification, have been added. Also, physical 
examination results and immunogenicity test results have been added to the safety analysis description.  
9. Adverse Event Reporting : The pregnancy reporting period has been clarified as the 
time from informed consent to [ADDRESS_224125] dose of study drug. Also, AE reporting for events that are not resolved at the time of study completion has been revised; AE outcomes with resolution dates if applicable should be reported on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF). 
10. Premedication : Subjects who have a hypersensitivity reaction are no longer required 
to premedicate with acetaminophen and antihistamine for all subsequent doses of study drug. However, premedication prior to study drug administration is encouraged.  
11. Return to Dosing following Hypersensitivity Reactions : Return to dosing following a 
hypersensitivity reaction should be based on investigator assessment in consultation 
with t he Sponsor’s Medical Officer.  
12. Pharmacokinetic Substudy : The sample size for the PK Substudy has been clarified as 
up to [ADDRESS_224126] : rAvPAL -PEG  information has been updated to include 
information regarding the addition of 20-mg vials and prefilled syringes with rAvPAL -PEG . 
14. Clinical Background Information:  Results from the  Phase [ADDRESS_224127] been updated to align with information provided in 
the Phase 3 studies. 
15. Schedule of Events and Study Procedures : The Schedule of Events and the Study 
Procedures sections have been updated to reflect the changes to this amendment.   
16. Sponsor’s Medical Officer : The Medical Officer information has been updated. - protocol.pdf Page 598

TITLE OF STUDY : 
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open- Label  Dose -Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL -PEG in Subjects with PKU  
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL -003 
STUDY SITES :  Approximately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT :  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE : 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) 
is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have 
additional clinical be nefits. This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase [ADDRESS_224129] diet are not allowed in this study unless per the Investigator. Diet  will be 
monitored using a diet diary. 
A pharmacokineti c (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in

dose PK data will be collected for subjec ts who have already achieved Phe reduction to within the 
protocol- defined target range.  
OBJECTIVES : 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long -term administration of multiple doses of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the immune response to long- term administration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration 
following administration with rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows: 
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who have achieved and maintained 
target blood Phe concentration and for whom no further dose modifications are planned. 
 
STUDY DESIGN AND PLA N: 
This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL- PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with PKU. The 
doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 studies (starting at 
0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided no dose- limiting toxicity is 
observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG study.  
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL -PEG study will be enrolled into this study. Subjects

starting dose determined per the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. The first dose will be administered in the 
clinic, and the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224133] diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be reviewed with the clinical study staff on a monthly basis.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_2725]’s 
Medical Officer and if adequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be 
considered appropriate for self administration.   
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Com mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
version  4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’ previous rAvPAL- PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL -003. In 
PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to  attempt to  attain or maintain blood Phe 
concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a subject’s weight or will 
be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range (60-600 µmol/L), the subject may 
be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per 
the discre tion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224134]:

• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator.  
•  The subject has completed the study through the Month 86 visit.  
•  The study is terminated.  
• The study drug receives marketing authorization. 
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subje cts will be asked to 
continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, 
and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to 
have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not 
compromise subject safety.  
Subjects who participate in this study will be required to transition into a Phase 3 study (165-302) if 
weekly doses of rAvPAL -PEG are between 70 mg/week and 350 mg/week (inclusive) provided that 
doses of rAvPAL -PEG  have been stable ( ie, no major change in dose for at least 4 weeks). Subjects 
who meet these criteria must be transitioned from PAL-003 to Study 165-302 provided they meet the 165-302 study eligibility criteria .  
Subjects who are eligible for Study 165 -302 but do not transition into 165-302 will be withdrawn from 
this study. 
The PAL -003 study will continue until BMN -165 is approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) for marketing in the [LOCATION_002] or until the sponsor terminates further development of this 
drug for the treatment of PKU.

Dose Modifications : 
Dose Increase Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions regarding 
dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations.  
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224136]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile 
and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10- fold higher than the subject’s 
current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, and 5.0 mg/kg or 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375 mg/week) or per Investigator determination based on available 
information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject. Dose increases 
 > 350 mg/week 
require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly dose not to exceed 5.0  mg/kg or 375 mg/week. Dose increases 
 > 350 mg/week require consultation 
with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224137] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following injecti on of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the 
overall weekly dose amount.  
• Only [ADDRESS_224138]’s blood

permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further d osing adjustments are 
required in response to safety , dosing frequency may also be reduced.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L), the subject’s rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose. If the condition persists after another

consult the dieticia n to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and 
nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician). 
Safety Assessment Criteria : 
If an individual su bject exhibits toxicity of a treatment -emergent CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_224141]’s data will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_079] (PI) 
and the Sponsor’s Medical Officer, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from the study treatment, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97146] : 
If 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit toxicity of a treatment -emergent CTCAE grade 3 or greater 
or a systemic reaction that is assessed as related to treatment with study drug, further dosing of subjects at that dose level will be evaluated and a safety assessment will be completed. In addition, the

7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of PEGylated recombinant A nabaena variabilis phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) is contained in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator 
should review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program for rAvPAL- PEG has characteriz ed the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG using the intended clinical SC route 
of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of 
PKU. The ENU2 mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, 
including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) 
and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL- PEG administered to male 
ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximat ely 2000 µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week  3 and Week 7 of dosing. After 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL- PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned as evidenced by [CONTACT_189640] 
< 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 weeks.  
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG -PAL, two dose interruption assessments were performed:  a 
2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose 
interruption assessments, the animals re -started rAvPAL -PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL- PEG injections were temporarily 
stopped for 2-4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A similar interim attenuated response was observed with the longer dose interruption of approximately 11 weeks.   In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG (Lapis, 2007, ASHG 57th Annual Meeting) . 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) effects were seen with SC administration of rAvPAL -PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were observed in telemetry -instrumented monkeys as sessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL -PEG administered subcutaneously. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half -life (t
1/2) values of rAvPAL- PEG administered to - protocol.pdf Page 623

Proprietary and Confidential  
normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_224166] area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) -dose. In the 
cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the t 1/2 was 65  hours at 
4.0 mg/kg, 71  hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest 
dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have similar characteristics. The following findings were noted: (1)  a 1-compartment m odel with 
first-order absorption appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL- PEG after 
single -dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after 
SC administration to maximum observed plasma concentration (C
max), along with a long t 1/2, 
(3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not appear to be a gender difference, 
and (5) the AUC and the C max are roughly linearly proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG was assessed in single -dose and repeat- dose studie s in normal 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose rat study, decreased body weight gain and Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the Kupffer cell finding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a 26-week repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and vacuolation of the histiocytic cells were observed in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. In a 39 -week repeat -dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid nodules in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this finding was completely reversed after [ADDRESS_224167] -level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL -PEG when admini stered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells in the rat and arterial inflammation find ings 
in the monkey.  
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan
® or are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  
This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG - protocol.pdf Page 624
 PAL -003 A5 Page 30 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
(Study  PAL -002, Study PAL -004, and Study 165-205) based on data from the completed 
clinical study, P AL-001, and clinical experience from this ongoing study and the other 
ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_224168] of rAvPAL-PEG on blood Phe concentrations. 
The effectiveness of rAvPAL -PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies of 
ENU2 mice was consistent with what was observed in PAL-001. PAL-001 enrolled 25 PKU 
subjects with a mean (standard deviation; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolled into the study were assigned to receive a single administration of rAvPAL -PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects each received 1  of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL- PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL -001 are summarized as follows: 
• rAvPAL -PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood -lowering 
effect on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  
• For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL- PEG, clinically 
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically 
significant decreases from baseline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3% (mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was 1113 µmol/L.  
• Overall, no clinically significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed in 
subjects who were administered rAvPAL -PEG at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003, 
0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg. 
• For subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG at the 3  higher dose levels (0.01, 
0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL-PEG concentration levels, the 
calculated PK parameters were a mean T
max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/[ADDRESS_224169] been designed 
to evaluate rAvPAL -PEG  at various doses and dosing regimens to safely achieve and 
maintain blood Phe reductions in subjects with PKU. Currently, there are three ongoing Phase 2 studies (PAL-002, PAL-004, 165-205); an overview of each study is presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -002), Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -004), and Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  (165-205).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -002 
Study PAL -002 (A Phase 2, Open- Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Sa fety, 
Efficacy, and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL- PEG in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in September [ADDRESS_224170] completed the study. PAL -002 enrolled 11 previously exposed subjects from the single-dose study, PAL- 001, and 
29 subjects who were naïve to rAvPAL -PEG . Thirty-three of the 37 subjects who completed 
PAL -002 enrolled into this open-label extension study ( PAL -003). Two sub jects 
discontinued from the study due to lost to follow-up, relocation, or other reasons, and [ADDRESS_224171] discontinued from the study due to an AE (skin reaction).  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of 
rAvPAL -PEG (ranging from 0.001 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week) on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU with up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary 
objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of multiple doses of rAvPAL -PEG , to evaluate the immune response to rAvPAL -PEG , and to 
evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL -PEG  in subjects with PKU.  
The PAL -002 study design consists of two parts. In Part 1, rAvPAL -PEG was administered 
as a once weekly fixed, low-dose induction regimen for 8 weeks. In Part 2, the rAvPAL -PEG  
dose was titrated upwards; subjects received adjustable dose increases for up to 8 weeks to 
achieve a target blood Phe concentration of 600 µmol/L. The doses and dosing schedules were revised with a series of protocol amendments to incorporate the information gained 
during conduct of this early, open- label , multiple -dose study.  
A wide range of doses was planned for the PAL-002 study, beginning with doses as low as 0.001mg/kg/week.  However, n o substantial reductions in blood Phe level were observed in 
the majority of subjects who were administered rAvPAL -PEG  in the initial four cohorts at 
doses of 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg  administered once per week . The absence of - protocol.pdf Page 626

Proprietary and Confidential  
appreciable Phe reduction after 16 weeks of treatment in this range of doses led to a decision 
to amend the study protocol to include a cohort with a higher starting dose of 0.1 
mg/kg/week, which had been previously shown to decrease blood Phe levels to 
approximately  600 µmol/L in the single -dose, Phase 1 study ( PAL -001). After the first 
2 weeks of dosing at 0.1 mg/kg/week, transient Phe reduction was observed in this subset of 
subjects.  However , this dosing regimen was accompanied by [CONTACT_189641], suggesting that additional 
exploration of dosing regimens would be required.  
In summary, preliminary results from PAL -002 demonstrated that doses below 0.1 g /kg 
administered once per week were not effective in reducing Phe levels.  While transient 
reduction of Phe was apparent at doses of at least 0.1 mg/kg given once per week, this dose regimen was associated with a high incidence of systemic hypersensitivity reactions, typi[INVESTIGATOR_189385].  Further escalation above this dose of 
0.1 mg/kg/week would be required to sustain the effect on Phe levels over time.  Increased doses would require spreading dose administration over several days per week, as once- weekly  administration of higher doses would not be practical due to the large volume of 
study drug.  Therefore, additional dosing regimens would need to be explored in a 
subsequent study (PAL-004). 
Once subjects completed Study  PAL -002, they were eligible to enr oll into t his open- label 
extension study, PAL-003 to continue to receive rAvPAL -PEG  up to a maximum dose of 
5.0 mg/kg/week  or 375 mg/week.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -004 
PAL -004 (An Open- Label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
Subcutaneous Dose Levels of rAvPAL- PEG Administered Daily in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in April [ADDRESS_224172] enrolled into this study  (PAL -003). One subject withdrew consent from 
continued participation prior to study completion. All subjects enrolled in this study were 
naïve to rAvPAL -PEG  exposure. 
The objective of this study was to determine if daily administration  (defined as 5days/week)  
of rAvPAL -PEG  at dose levels of 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day was safe and 
effective in reducing and maintaining blood Phe concentrations to 600 µmol/L in subjects with PKU. The starting dose was 0.4 mg/kg, administered 5 days/week. A total of 12 subjects - protocol.pdf Page 627

were added in sequence and were started on doses of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06 mg, or 0.001/kg/day 
based on incoming safety data. Overall, subjects in PAL- 004 who initiated treatment at 
higher daily doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg /day achieved immediate and substantial reduction of 
blood Phe levels, but dosing had to be temporarily reduced or interrupted due to the onset of systemic hypersensitivity reactions at approximately Day [ADDRESS_224173] in the setting of temporary dose reduction or interruption, but Phe levels generally improved if higher dose levels were reinstated .  
To prevent the onset of hypersensitivity reactions that were temporally associated with the onset of anti- drug IgM responses, an additional dosing strategy was assessed in PAL-004; 
4 subjects initiated dosing at a low dose of 0.001mg/kg/day or 0.06mg/kg/day for [ADDRESS_224174] the planned dose interruption, suggesting little advantage with this alternate induction regimen .  
Experience from PAL -004 indicated that initiating daily rAvPAL -PEG  dosing with relatively 
high daily doses was not sustainable due to the onset of hypersensitivity reactions that occurred approximately 9 to 12 days after the start of administration, nor was the alternate dosing regimen (2 week drug holiday) well tolerated or effective in Phe reduction. In 
addition, the daily treatment regimen did not reduce the time to achieve target blood Phe levels  seen in previous studies. This study indicated that to improve tolerability, 
rAvPAL -PEG  should be initiated with an induction period at doses subs tantially lower than 
0.4mg/kg, followed by [CONTACT_189642].   
Once subjects com pleted Study  PAL -004, they were eligible to enroll into this  open- label

effective and well tolerated. The objective of this study  was to further assess this dosing 
regimen. Two rAvPAL -PEG  dosing regimens were to be explored in this study:  weekly low-
dose induction (2.5 mg/week for 4 to 8 weeks), followed by a period of upward dose titration  
towards a target Phe level (600 µmol/L ) followed by [CONTACT_189643] 24 week study duration (Group 1).  The other dosing regimen planned for this 
study (Group 2) involved administration of a single bolus dose of [ADDRESS_224175] 3 weeks  duration followed by [CONTACT_189644] a pattern similar to that employed in Group 1. A total of 24 subjects were enroll ed into 165-205. In addition to confirming an effective, well- tolerated 
dose regimen, this study incorporated non- weight -based dosing, starting with dose 
administration once per week  at a low dose (2.5mg) with gradual escalation and conversion 
of dose administration to  5x/week  dosing for chronic maintenance therapy .  
Once subjects have completed Study  165-205, they are eligible to enroll into this study  to 
continue to receive rAvPAL -PEG  up to a maximum dose of 5.0 mg/kg/week  or 
375 mg/week , or into the Phase 3 study, BMN 165-302. 
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inher ited disease characterized by [CONTACT_189448]. Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North America is born with PKU  Scriver, 2001, McGraw- Hill) . Left untreated, PAH deficiency is associated with an abnormal ly 
elevated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr. ) and can 
result in a variety of neuropathologic conditions, including mental retardation, microcephaly, 
delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities (Scriver, 2001, McGraw- Hill) . The 
brains of untreated patients with PKU show evidence of hypomyelination and gliosis, arrest 
in cerebral development, and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, 
Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated Phe during fetal development leads to severe mental retardation and 
can cause microcephaly, growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, 
Pediatrics ), (Koch, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Lee, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics ), 
(Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr. ). 
For a subset of patie nts with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan
® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of PKU involves adherence to low- Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containing foods. Implementation of a Phe-restrict ed diet in infancy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents 
many of the neuropathologic manifestations of PKU, including severe mental retardation. - protocol.pdf Page 629
 PAL -003 A5 Page 35 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adole scents, 
and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of 
natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet ). 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals w ith PKU safely achieve lifelong, 
reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. rAvPAL- PEG is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL -PEG may control blood Phe 
concentrations, which may have additional clinical benefits.  
Blood Phe levels depend not only on the functional presence of the endogenous enzyme PAH 
but also on the dietary intake of Phe. It is important to understand the role of diet on blood Phe levels concurrent with the administration of rAvPAL- PEG treatment. Therefore, an 
exploratory objective has been added to this study to assess the relationship of diet, rAvPAL -PEG administration, and blood Phe level. Changes to subject diet are not allowed in 
this study unless per the Investigator. Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.     
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of 
rAvPAL -PEG in up to [ADDRESS_224176] already achieved Phe reduction to within the protocol- defined target range.  
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL- PEG Phase 2 studies. Administration of 
rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess the long- term safety and efficacy  of rAvPAL -PEG 
in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from previous rAvPAL- PEG studies wi ll change the assumption 
that rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include injection -site reactions and other general sympto ms. - protocol.pdf Page 630
 PAL -003 A5 Page 36 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
7.4.1 Toxicity Due to Exposure to Polyethylene Glycol ( PEG ) 
Acute exposure to high doses of PEG can result in renal toxicity. There have been a few 
reports of PEG -related AEs in humans; cumulative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, oliguria, and azotemia. The anticipated  PEG 
exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely used medicines and other compounds that are administered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, r ectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189286] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG- related toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been assocated with PEG -related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins 
(refer to Section  7.1).  
In this study, subjects will be monitored closely with urine examinations and blood chemistries to follow kidney function. 
7.4.2 Toxicity Due to an Immunologic Reaction 
The active drug substance in rAvPAL- PEG is a bacterial protein, and as such, it is expected 
that it may elicit imm une recognition and responses. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_189287] a role in the immune 
response may be rendered inaccessible by [CONTACT_31410] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab ). In vivo 
and in vitro experiments have shown that PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the 
immunological response (Scott, 1997, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs. ). 
PEGylation has been effective in reducing anti-rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model, 
although PEGylation does not eliminate antibody formation. Although PEGylation of 
rAvPAL may have a significant effect on reducing the immunogenicity of the molecule, it is reasonable to expect that so me individuals may exhibit immune responses upon exposure to 
the drug. These immune responses may be clinically irrelevant, cause symptoms of various degrees, or lead to neutralization of biological activity. Subjects participating in clinical trials will be monitored closely with specific antibody titers sedimentation rates, and complete 
blood counts (CBCs). 
As of May 2012, a total of [ADDRESS_224177] been administered rAvPAL- PEG in the single -
dose, Phase 1 study (PAL-001) and in the repeat -dosing Phase 2 studies (P AL-002, 
PAL -004, and PAL-003). The dose levels in the repeat -dosing studies range from 0.001 to 
5.0 mg/kg/week administered in various frequencies (including 5 days a week). The most 
clinically significant AEs have been hypersensitivity reactions that have led to dosing - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224178] been reported as related to rAvPAL -PEG. Two of the study- drug related 
SAEs occurred in Study PAL -001. Both of these SAEs occurred in subjects in the lower dose 
cohorts: an SAE of hypersensitivity reaction in a subject in the 0.001 mg/kg cohort and an SAE of anaphylactic reaction (urticaria) in a subject in the 0.01 mg/kg cohort . Neither SAE 
was severe or resulted in discontinuation from the study, and both of the SAEs resolved. There were no S AEs in subjects in the higher dose cohorts (0.03 mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg) in 
PAL -001. The third study drug- related SAE (angioedema) occurred in a subject in Study 
PAL -004. The fourth SAE (urticaria, dehydration) was reported as not related to study drug 
and occurred in a subject in Study PAL-002.  There have been no reports of anaphylaxis for any subject treated with rAvPEG -PAL (as of January 2012).  
Subjects who have a systemic clinical reaction at any time during this study may undergo a series of assessments to monitor safety, including assessment of complements, C- reactive 
protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and IgE antibodies.  Reintroduction of rAvPAL -PEG dosing after a reaction will depend on clinical assessments and available 
laboratory data, such as chemistry and urine studies, to ensure that there has been no end-organ damage prior to resuming treatment with rAvPAL -PEG. As of May 2012, 
antibody titers, including positive IgE titers, have not been predictive of future clinical reactions w hen dosing with rAvPAL-PEG.  Additionally, subjects may be premedicated  to 
prevent or mitigate risk of hypersensitivity  reactions (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3).  
PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.), (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.) , however, antibodies against PEG may form when PEG is bound to 
compounds. (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.),(Richter, 1983, Int.Arch .Allergy 
Appl.Immunol.) .  In some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in any 
significant clinical effects in humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . 
In some individuals, anti-PEG antibodies may be pre-existing due to previous exposure to 
PEG in other products. Anti-PEG antibodies have been associated with nonresponsiveness against therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer) , (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.) .  
Administration of rAvPAL- PEG may lead to anti -PEG antibody formation, and the duration 
of this possible effect is not known. Subjects in the Phase [ADDRESS_224179]’s future ability to be treated with other PEG -containing (eg, Depo -Provera) or 
PEGylated (eg,  PEG -interferon) injectable drugs. It is therefore recommended that any 
PEG -containing injectable drug administered to subjects after completion of this study be 
done under medical observation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Systemic Skin Reactions  
Two out of 25 subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL- 001 and received the 
protocol-defined single dose of rAvPAL- PEG reported systemic skin reactions (generalized 
skin rash) that were attributed to treatment with study drug. One subject received a single 
dose of 0.001 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG, and the other subject received a single dose of 
0.01 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG. One of these events was reported as serious, and the other was 
reported as nonserious; both events were reported following administration of Depo- Provera 
inject ions (medroxyprogesterone injection), an injectable contraception. These allergic 
reactions are thought to be related to the PEG molecules that are found in both the study drug, rAvPAL -PEG, and Depo-Provera. These reactions are not likely to be experienced 
concurrent with other birth control medications. 
The [ADDRESS_224180]; however, no further reactions or complications were reported following subsequent administration of a full dose of Depo-Provera. Upon study completion, the subject continued to receive regular 
doses (every 3 months) of Depo-Provera, and no further reactions were reported. The second subject also had a positive reaction to Depo- Provera following administration o f the skin 
prick test. When a subsequent full dose of Depo-Provera was administered,  developed hives, itching, and chills. The subject’s symptoms resolved within [ADDRESS_224181] basis for these reported events and their duration is not known, the use of PEG-containing injectable drugs prior to, during, and after this study is prohibited as a precautionary measure (refer to Section  9.3.2 and Section 9.4.8).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions to the SC injection of rAvPAL-PEG may be mild, moderate , or 
severe in intensity. Reactions may include pruritus, rash, shortness of breath, hypotension, or anaph ylaxis. Clinical assessments should be conducted for a minimum of 30minutes 
post-injection. Longer observations may be required at the discretion of the PI. The responsible physician should use all appropriate measures for the treatment of 
hypersensitivity  reactions. Because of the small potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for 
emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be within easy access during and after the rAvPAL -PEG injection. Subjects who qualify for self administration of study drug 
will be provided with emergency resuscitation instructions (refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_224182] Self -Administration Training Materials).  
In the event of a hypersensitivity  reaction, subjects may be asked to see an 
allergist/immunologist and/or provide up to 3 additional blood samples for immunology studies and complement testing. This additional testing may occur up to 6 months following the final study visit.   
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of hypersensitivity reaction  
symptoms: 
• Maintain the airway.  
• Vital sign check.  
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. - protocol.pdf Page 634

Proprietary and Confidential  
• Administration of oral or IV glucocorticoids.  
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment (eg, acetaminiophen or 
ibuprofen). 
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center.  
 
In addition, clinical judgment must be used in determining the appropriateness of 
corticosteroid administration. An allergy and/or immunology consultation should be sought if necessary. Information regarding the management of local skin, large local skin, and systemic reactions is provided in Section  9.1.1. Detailed instructions for the management of 
hypersensitivity  reactions are provided in the Study Reference Manual.  - protocol.pdf Page 635

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a long-term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with 
PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested  in the Phase 2 
studies (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided 
no dose- limiting toxicity was  observed in a previous rAvPAL-PEG studies. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL-PEG study will be enrolled into this study. 
Subjects enrolling into PAL-[ADDRESS_224183] their starting dose determined per the Sponsor’s 
Medical Officer.  The first dose will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be  
observed for [ADDRESS_224184] diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be brought to clinic monthly for review with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_2725]’s Medical Officer and if adequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be considered appropriate for self administration. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_224185] Self -Administration Training Materials.  
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of 
subjects in the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatmen t of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’previous rAvPAL- PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL-003. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224186]’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to  attain or maintain 
blood Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a 
subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 9.1.[ADDRESS_224187]’s blood Phe concentration has been 
controlled to within a target range (60 -600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have 
additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per the 
discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s M edical Officer.  
A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 86 visit.  
• The study is terminated.  
• The study drug receives marketing authorization.  
 
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perf orm the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may 
also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to ret ain subjects in the study and to have them complete the study assessments as scheduled 
as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety. 
Subjects who participate in this study will be required to trans ition into a Phase 3 study 
(165-302) if weekly doses of rAvPAL -PEG  are between 70 mg/week and 350 mg/week 
(inclusive) provided that doses of rAvPAL -PEG  have been stable (ie, no major change in 
dose for at least 4 weeks). Subjects who meet these criteria must be transitioned from 
PAL -[ADDRESS_224188] additional pre-dose PK sampling performed (refer to Table 9.1.2).

Subjects who had a previous systemic reaction to rAvPAL -PEG or a PEG -containing product 
that warranted early termination from a previous rAvPAL-PEG study are excluded from participation in this study. Subjects who have had a previous local skin reaction to rAvPAL -PEG in a previous rAvPAL- PEG study are eligible to participate in this study. 
Subjects who have had a previous reaction and are deemed eligible for participation must be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or non- sedating antihistamines [ADDRESS_224202] is accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).  
Subjects may develop 
systemic, large local skin, or local skin reactions after enrollment in PAL-003. Refer to Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] for definitions of systemic and local skin reactions. For management of 
hypersensitivity reactions that occur during this study, refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and

[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Reaction and Hypersensitivity Reactions to rAvPAL- PEG 
Administered Subcutaneously  
During Study PAL- 003, subjects may experience hypersensitivity reactions  to rAvPAL- PEG. 
The hypersensitivity reactions are defined as follows:  
Local skin reaction: 
• Skin signs or symptoms in 1 affected primary location, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling 
or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the s ite of 
injection.  - protocol.pdf Page 645
 PAL -003 A5 Page 51 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Large local skin reaction: 
• Skin signs or symptoms, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, 
redness, or induration with pain or itching that extends beyond the site of injection by 
[CONTACT_3450] 6 inches (15 cm) and/or signs or symptoms that are not contiguous to the injection site. These may be associated with a low risk of systemic symptoms or anaphylaxis upon re- exposure and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction 
when not contiguous to the injection site.  
Systemic reaction (including generalized skin symptoms): 
• Skin and non-skin signs or symptoms in more than 1 affected primary location, 
ie, cutaneous reaction in more than 1 area and/or anaphylaxis or any other generalized 
symptoms, such as hypotension, angioedema or the involvement of other organ 
systems, eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological; and/or a fever attributed to treatment with rAvPAL -PEG (  ≥ 100.4°F or  ≥ 38°C).

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Local Skin Reactions 
All subjects who experience a local skin reaction during this study may be premedicated  
orally with acetaminophen and/or non- sedating antihistamines 1 -2 hours prior to study drug 
dosing (subjects may take non- sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all 
future study doses. Recommended premedications are acetaminophen and/or non- sedating 
antihistamine. The dosage will be standard. Subjects must be accompanied by a designated 
driver (if applicable) b ecause antihistamines can cause drowsiness. Symptoms of local 
reactions may be treated with local application of ice and non -sedating  oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_189386]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If the local skin reaction worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_183082]’s Medical Officer) even with premedication prior to study drug dosing, the subject must be withdrawn from study treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Large Local Skin Reactions 
Large local skin reactions (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition) may or may not be 
contiguous to the rAvPAL- PEG injection site, and subjects with either type of large local 
skin reaction may continue dosing if the skin symptoms have resolved and no other 
symptoms have developed. Subjects will be encouraged to  premedicate orally with 
acetaminophen and/or non- sedating antihistamines 1 -2 hours prior to study drug dosing 
(subjects may take non- sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all future study 
doses. 
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as needed (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

(subjects may take non- sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all future study 
doses. Because antihistamines can cause drowsiness, it may be administered only if the subject is accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).  - protocol.pdf Page 648

[IP_ADDRESS].2.2 Large Local Skin Reactions Not Contiguous to Injection Site 
Large local skin reactions that are not contiguous to the injection site may be associated with 
a low risk of systemic symptoms or anaphylaxis upon re-exposure to rAvPAL-PEG and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3). An example of 
a large local reaction that is not contiguous to the injection site is if an injectio n took place in 
the right upper arm and there are lesions beyond the elbow joint in the right forearm or lesions beyond the shoulder joint on the right trunk. 
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as needed (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Systemic Reactions  
Subjects who experience a systemic reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for a definition) after 
administration of rAvPAL-PEG must stop further administrations of rAvPAL-PEG and must immediately return to the clinic for safety assessments. Subjects who experience generalized skin symptoms are included in this category. Immediately after the systemic reaction (within 24 hours), subjects with generalized skin symptoms must have additional assessments performed for safety (ie, Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit): serum antibodies (anti-PAL IgG, anti- PAL IgM, anti -PEG IgG, anti- PEG IgM, anti rAvPAL -PEG IgE, 
anti-rAvPAL -PEG neutralizing antibodies); serum tryptase level (it is recommended that th is 
sample be drawn immediately after reaction); urine albumin/creatinine ratio; urine N -methyl 
histamine; CRP, CH50, C
1, C3, and C 4; skin biopsy ( optional; affected and not affected area; 
to be performed within 1 week of reaction); and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology; refer to Figure  [IP_ADDRESS].1.  
Following the reaction, subjects will be required to complete the assessments of the Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction visit, including assessment of IgE. If a subject presents with a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, further dosing will be held while laboratory evaluation of IgE, as part of the Unscheduled Systemic Reaction Visit, is performed.  Subjects may resume study drug administration per the discretion of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s Medical Officer; however, if subject was dosing at home, they will be required to come into the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_224204] week of resumed dosing. Subjects will be encouraged to  premedicate o rally with 
acetaminophen and/or antihistamines 1-2 hours prior to study drug dosing (subjects may take 
non-sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all future study doses. Additionally, subjects must be closely monitored for [ADDRESS_224205] be accompanied by  a designated driver (if applicable) .   
If blood Phe concentrations are not 60-600 µmol/L following 1  week of daily administration 
at the  lowered dose cohort and there is no further evidence of toxicity (ie, another systemic 
reaction attributed to rAvPAL -PEG administration or clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test results), the  subject may be administered the next highest dose leve l in the 
clinic per the allowable dose increases outlined in Section  9.1.2. Subjects will be encouraged 
to premedicate orally with acetaminophen and/or antihistamines 1 -2 hours prior to study drug 
dosing (subjects may take non- sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all 
future study doses. Additionally, subjects must be closely monitored for [ADDRESS_224206] be accompanied by a designated driver  (if applicable).  
9.1.2 Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology  
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions 
regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and 
drug concentrations. 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224207]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. - protocol.pdf Page 650
 PAL -003 A5 Page 56 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 
0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8,  1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, a nd 5.0 mg/kg  or 
2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375 mg/week ) or per Investigator determination 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as 
well as any adverse events for an individual subject.  Dose increases  > 350 mg/week 
require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg  or 375 mg/week.   Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require 
consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224208] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not 
need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology  
Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a 
subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse event (any hypersensitivity reaction as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Dose decreases may occur for hypophenylalanemia or 
any adverse event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent  dose. 
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg or 375, 300, 225, 150, 75, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 
mg/week ). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If 
further dosing adjustments are required in response to safety, dosing frequency may also  be 
reduced.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L ), the 
subject’s rAvPAL-PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224209] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods 
and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician). - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224210]’s da ta will be evaluated by [CONTACT_189645] (PI) and the Sponsor’s Medical Officer, and a decision will then be 
made whether to discontinue the subject from the study treatment, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dos e level.  
9.1.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_42224] 2 or more subjects at a dose level exhibit toxicity of a treatment -emergent CTCAE grade 3 
or greater or a systemic reaction that is assessed as related to treatment with study drug, further dosing of subjects at that dose leve l will evaluated and a safety assessment will be 
completed. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may be notified of this occurrence if appropriate.

This is an open- label study.  
9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications taken by a subject for 30 days before Screening will be recorded on the designated CRF. The Investigator may prescribe 
additional medications during the study, as long as the prescribed medication is not 
prohibited by [CONTACT_760]. In the event of an emergency, any needed medications may be prescribed without prior approval, but the Sponsor’s Medical Officer must be notified of the use of any contraindicated medications immediately thereafter. Any concomitant medications added or discontinued during the study should be recorded on the CRF. 
Use of any investigational product (with the exception of rAvPAL-PEG used in a previous 
rAvPAL -PEG study) or investigational medical device within 30  days before Screening, or 
requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments, is prohibited. - protocol.pdf Page 661

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., 
sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study- drug or other 
protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577].  
• Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions (eg, AEs related to s creening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment run -
in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relatio nship between the study-drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
The study period during which all non-serious AEs and SAEs will be reported begins afte r 
informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug  and continues until [ADDRESS_224237] visit of the treatment period (refer to Section 12). After informed consent but prior to initiation of study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 10.2.   
The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Outcome of AEs ( and resolution dates) should be 
documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record  unless the 
subject is lost to follow -up or it has been determined that the study treatment or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. 
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, re lationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see  Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224238]/event outcome or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the genera l 
guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated;  limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of 
daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening : hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48622]; disabling; limiting self care activities of dail y 
living (ADL)  
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent 
intervention indicatedb 
5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the 
toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224239] it 
on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship Description  
Not Related  Exposure to the IP has not occurred 
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use 
of the IP; that is, there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP. 
Possibly Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189578]. 
Probably Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189579].  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189580], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology).  - protocol.pdf Page 671

Proprietary and Confidential  
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 1 
or more of the foll owing criteria:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life threatening.  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event or reaction.  
The reporting period for SAEs begins after informed consent is obtained, and continues until 
[ADDRESS_224240] be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event by [CONTACT_189581] -specific SAE Report Form to 
BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). Each SAE must also be reported in the CRF Investigators should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before 
notifying BPV of a SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any infor mation requested by [CONTACT_189648].  The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study 
treatment or participa tion is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should 
be documented in the CRF and in the subject’s medical record. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate 
the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report). - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224241]’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation if felt to  be related to prior 
study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that participated in this study.  
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation must be obtained by [CONTACT_189627]. 
10.[ADDRESS_224242] through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and to report the resolution to BPV in the study reference materials. In the event 
of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the Investigator should make every reasonable 
attempt to o btain the woman’s consent for release of protected health information. 
10.[ADDRESS_224243] the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the li ght of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the Inve stigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the - protocol.pdf Page 673
 PAL -003 A5 Page 79 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/REB is not ified at the same time.” The reporting period for these events which may 
require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
• Immediate need to revise the IP admin istration (i.e., modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol). 
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management. 
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency and percent, while continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical analysis.  
14.[ADDRESS_224253] postdose safety information will be included in the safety analyses.  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology (MedDRA) will be used by [CONTACT_189649] (CRF).  
The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity . A by –subject listing will be provided for those subjects who 
experience a serious AE (SAE), including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study drug. Hypersensitivity AEs and AEs that result in dosing interruptio n or dose level reduction are of interest, and the percentage of subjects who report 
these AEs will be presented.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. Frequency and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference range) and/or 
clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each 
clinical laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post-treatment visits. Changes from baseline to the post-treatment visits will also be provided. Descriptive statisticsof vital signs, physical 
examination results, ECG results, and X- ray results , and immunogenicity test results will also 
be provided.  Additionally, antibodies and titers will be summarized by [CONTACT_51256].

(Tmax), maximum plasma concentration (C max), half life ( t1/2), and clearance (CL/F) .  Should 
data become available from previous rAvPAL- PEG studies that indicate study drug 
accumulation should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added for PK analysis 
as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer. 
14.3.[ADDRESS_224255]- treatment efficacy data will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration from baseline (to be defined in the SAP) to each scheduled time point and presence/absence 
of antibodies will also be summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe concentrations of 60 -600 µmol/L will be summarized by [CONTACT_189594]. 
The relationship of dietary Phe intake (per information reported on the subject diet diary) and 
blood Phe concentration will also be explored. Subjects who received any amount of study drug with any post-treatment blood Phe concentration measurements and diet diary information will be included in this exploratory analysis.  
Details regarding exploratory analyses  will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
14.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Subjects who participated in previous rAvPAL-PEG studies may be enrolled into this study. 
No formal sample size calculation was conducted for this study or the PAL-003 Substudy.   
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
All analyses will be presented based on observed da ta only. Missing data will not be imputed 
for analyses unless sensitivity analyses are warranted. If imputations are used, detailed 
imputation methods will be described in the SAP before locking the database. - protocol.pdf Page 684

15 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC)  
The DMC will act independently in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the safety 
of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who participate in the study.  
The responsibilities of the DMC are to: 
• Review the study protocol, informed consent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, subjects’ risk versus benefit, and other factors that could affect the study outcome. 
• Assess the effect and relevance of new external evidence. 
• Consider relevant information tha t may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189316] 9.1.4. 
• Make recommendations to the BioMarin concerning continuation or termination of the study or other study modifications based on observations. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224258]’s disease, that are not part of this study. Costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre- specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subject should be given the na me of a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance with, treatment for study- related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment, unless the executed Clinical Trial Agreement between BioMarin and the institution of the investigator specifies otherwise. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s instructions, BioMarin may  pay for reasonable and necessary 
medical services to t reat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224259] be completed using a web–based application t hat has been validated. Study site 
personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will correct the value by [CONTACT_187698]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the site personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent.  
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189630] 
“source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is 
needed,  the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the quer y or re –query 
the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, all data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying that the information on the CRFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the - protocol.pdf Page 688

Section 2/Synopsis, Study Rationale  ….This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies PAL -002, PAL -004, and 165 -205. 
Administration of rAvPAL- PEG will be continued to assess whether long term dosing the long -term safety 
and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentrations  in PKU subjects.  
….Therefore, an exploratory objective has been added  to this study to assess the relationship of diet, 
rAvPAL -PEG administration, and blood Phe level. Changes to subject diet are not allowed in this study 
unless per the Investigatorin consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer . Diet  will be monitored using a 
diet diary. 
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in a 
minimum of up to [ADDRESS_224270] 2 consecutive 
weeks measurements  and for whom no further dose modifications are planned. Single-dose PK data has been 
collected in the Phase 1 study, PAL -001….

Section 2/Synopsis, 
Study Design and Plan This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in approximately up to  100 subjects with PKU. The 
doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously  tested in the Phase 2 studies  PAL 002 and PAL 004 
(starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided no dose- limiting toxicity is 
observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG study.  
…. The first dose will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224271] be made per 
the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer  and must be performed under the supervision 
of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer . To monitor for changes in subject diet, a 
diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be reviewed with the clinical study staff on a monthly basis.  
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take rAvPAL -PEG. 
Subjects’ previous rAvPAL -PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL -003. In PAL-003, each subject’s dose will 
be adjusted as needed to attempt to  attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG 
dose will be based on either a subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose (subjects who have maintained blood Phe 
levels to 60 600 µmol/L for at least [ADDRESS_224272] 2 consecutive weeks) . Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.  
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 8 60 visit.  
•  The study drug receiv es marketing authorization.

Study Design and Plan Subjects who participate in this study will be required to transition into a Phase 3 study (165 -302) if weekly 
doses of rAvPAL -PEG are between 70 mg/week and 350 mg/week (inclusive) provided that doses of rAvPAL-
PEG have been stable (ie, no major change in dose for at least 4 weeks). Subjects who meet these criteria must 
be transitioned from PAL-003 to Study 165-302 provided they meet the 165-302 study eligibility criteria.  
Subjects who are eligible for Study 165 -302 but do not transition into 165-302 will be withdrawn from this 
study.  
The PAL -003 study will continue until BMN-165 is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for 
marketing in the [LOCATION_002] or until the sponsor terminates further development of this drug for the treatment 
of PKU.

Dose Modifications Dose Increase Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator, in agreement with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Officer . Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood 
Phe and drug concentrations.  
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224274]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe 
concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 
0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, and 5.0 mg/kg ) or 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 
375 mg/week)  or per Investigator determination in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer  
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse 
events (any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual sub ject. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require 
consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly dose not to exceed 
5.0 mg/kg Subjects who increase their dose frequency will ha ve additional assessments performed 
(Interim Dosing Visit) or 375 mg/week. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require consultation with the 
sponsor’s medical monitor . 
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224275] mo dified 
dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following 
injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount.

Section 2/Synopsis, 
Dose Modifications Dose Decrease Methodology  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical Officer.  Decisions 
regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60 -600 µmol/L) , 
as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie,  
hypophenylalanemia or  any adverse event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose) .  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 
0.003, 0.001 mg/kg or 375, 300, 225, 150, 75, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/week). It is also permitted to decrease 
dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required to attain the target Phe 
concentration in response to safety , dosing frequency may also  be reduced. 
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L as measured by [CONTACT_189650] a minimum of 1 month ), the subject’s rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose. 
If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224276] 
may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be 
monitored by a dietician).

Clinical Studies  The rAvPAL -PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects who do not respond to 
treatment with Kuvan® or are n ot compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  This study is an extension of the 
ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG (Study  PAL -002, Study PAL-004, and Study 
165-205) based on data from the completed clinical study, PAL-001, and clinical experience as of

with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer . Diet  will be monitored using a diet diary.     
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in a 
minimum of up to [ADDRESS_224282] already achieved Phe 
reduction to within the protocol- defined target  range.  
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL- PEG Phase 2  studies. Administration of rAvPAL- PEG 
will be continued to assess whether long term dosing the long- term safety and efficacy of 
rAvPAL -PEG is safe and can maintain reduced blood Phe concentra tions  in PKU subjects.

Study Design and Plan This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in approximately up to  100 subjects with PKU. 
The doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously  tested in the Phase 2 studies  PAL 002 and 
PAL 004 (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/ kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided no 
dose- limiting toxicity is observed in a previous rAvPAL- PEG study.  
…. The first dose will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224284] be made per 
the Investigator in consu ltation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer  and must be performed under the 
supervision of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor’s Medical Officer . To monitor for changes in 
subject diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be reviewed with the clinical study staff on a monthly basis.  
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take rAvPAL -PEG. 
Subjects’ previous rAvPAL -PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL -003. In PAL-003, each subject’s dose 
will be adjusted as needed to attempt to  attain or maintain blood Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. 
rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose (subjects who have 
maintained blood Phe levels t o 60 600 µmol/L for at least [ADDRESS_224285] 2 consecutive weeks) . Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 8 60 visit.  
•  The study drug receives marketing authorization.

Phe and drug concentrations.  
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224290]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe 
concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 
0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, and 5.0 mg/kg ) or 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300,

based on available information regardi ng a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse 
events (any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require 
consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg Subjects who increase their dose frequency will have additional assessments performed 
(Interim Dosing Visit) or 375 mg/week. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require consultation with the 
sponsor’s medical monitor . 
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224291] modified 
dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following 
injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount.

Decrease Methodology  Dose Decrease Methodology  
All dose decreases must be agreed to by [CONTACT_29548]’s Medical Officer.  Decisions 
regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60 -600 µmol/L), 
as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases may occur for safety (ie,  
hypophenylalanemia or  any adve rse event that may be improved with a lower, more frequent dose) .  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01,

dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required to attain the target Phe 
concentration in response to safety , dosing frequency may also  be reduced. 
If the subject develops low  blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L as measured by [CONTACT_189650] a minimum of 1 month ), the subject’s rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose. 
If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224292] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a ba lanced and

Proprietary and Confidential  CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY  
Ame ndme nt: 6  
Date : October 30, 2014 
 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
The protocol for Study PAL-003 is being amended to make the f ollowing change s: 
1. All subjects who are on stable doses of rAvPAL- PEG, including subjects on doses 
between 70 mg/week and 350 mg/week (inclusive) may remain in this study to continue open- label administration with rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects may be eligible for 
participation in the long-term, open-label extension portion of the Phase [ADDRESS_224307] a better understanding of the risk/benefit with rAvPAL- PEG administration. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189392] (DMC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
a. If a severe or life- threatening National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTC AE) grade  ≥ 3 hypersensitivity event 
occurs that is treatment- related and meets clinical criteria (Brown, 2004, 
J.Allergy Clin.Immunol. ) for severe, an ad hoc independent DMC will 
convene within [ADDRESS_224308] an NCI- CTCAE grade  ≥ 3 hypersensitivity 
event that is treatment- related and is suspected to meet the clinical criteria 
(Brown, 2004, J.Allergy Clin.Immunol. ) for severe in the judgment of th e 
investigator and the sponsor’s medical monitor may be permanently discontinued from study drug. 
c. Anaphylaxis (per National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food 
Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network  [NIAID/FAAN] criteria) is an AE of 
special interest  that should be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_224309] been added:  
a. Premedications administered prior to study drug for subjects who have had a 
hypersensitivity AE have been revised based on a better understanding of the 
safety profile of rAvPAL -PEG. Changes are also consistent with 
recommendations from an independent immunologist. Should premedication be required, H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) should be administered 
approximately [ADDRESS_224310] not expi[INVESTIGATOR_189393].   
5. Information to track and categorize device (prefilled syringe) malfunction and failures, device- related injuries, and any medication errors attributed to device 
performance has been added.    
6. Anti-rAvPAL immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody assessment has been added to the 
Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit to better assess IgE response. The anti- protein IgE 
test serves as a control to determine whether anti -rAvPA L IgE antibody positivity 
may be missed in anti- rAvPAL -PEG IgE assessment due to potential protein epi[INVESTIGATOR_189394].  The collection and testing of serum anti- PAL 
IgG, anti-PAL IgM, anti- PEG IgG, anti -PEG IgM and anti -rAvPAL -PEG neutralizing 
antibodies for Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Visits are no longer necessary as all these antibodies are tested frequently (at routine study visits) and can provide results at or near the time of an hypersensitivity AE.  
7. rAvPAL -PEG dosing information has been revised to include instructions specific to 
prefilled syringe. Self -administration training for prefilled syringe drug product has 
been added.  
8. The study duration has been extended for another [ADDRESS_224311] a year; 
in addition, all subjects in the ongoing Phase 3 BMN 165 studies are dosed at home.  
Safety data to date indicate that mild to moderate hypersensitivity adverse events commonly occur in subjects receiving BMN 165 but can generally be safely managed with continued home-based dosing.   Safety precautions including detailed guidance regarding response to hypersensitivity AEs are being added to all ongoing studies; this guidance supersedes previous PAL-003 instruction mandating return to clinic -based dosing for all hypersensitivity reactions or Grade 3 or higher adverse 
events.  In addition, PAL-003 experience has shown that dosing adjustments (either increase or decrease) are occasionally necessary to maintain optimal Phe control in the long term and can be safely made without return to clinic-based dosing. 
13. The rAvPAL-PEG immunogenicity profile has been revised and updated. Information that characterizes the specific antibody responses detected in subjects has been added.  
14. Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. 
Specific major revisions since the completion of the last protocol amendment (Amendment 5, 
dated 28FEB2014) to the text of each section are outlined in Section 24.

PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL -003 
STUDY SITES :  Approximately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT :  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE : 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) 
is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in 
individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have 
additional clinical benefits. This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase [ADDRESS_224313] diet are not allowed in this study unless per the Investigator. Diet  will be

OBJECTIVES : 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long -term administration of multiple doses of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of th e study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the immune response to long- term administration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with  PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration 
following administration with rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows: 
• To evalu ate steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who have achieved and maintained 
target blood Phe concentration and for whom no further dose modifications are planned.  
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN : 
This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL- PEG Phase 2 studies in up  to 100 subjects with PKU. The 
doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 studies (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided no dose- limiting toxicity is 
observed in a previou s rAvPAL -PEG study. Subjects’ doses will not exceed 375 mg/week. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL -PEG study will be enrolled into this study. Subjects 
enrolling into PAL -[ADDRESS_224315] their 
starting dose determined per the sponsor’s medical monitor . The first dose will be administered in the 
clinic, and the subject must be observed for 30 minutes following administration. Additionally, subjects will be given two epi[INVESTIGATOR_189395] (refer to Section  9.4). A follow- up telephone call will be made to the - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224316]:

Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189659]’s 
medical monitor and if adequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be considered appropriate for self-administration.  Additional training will be provided to subjects and 
demonstration of competency required when prefilled syringe drug product is introduced, every 
24 weeks, and more often as needed.  
Subjects will be evaluated for safety th roughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version  4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subje cts in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’ previous rAvPAL- PEG dosing will gen erally continue in PAL- 003. In 
PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to attain or maintain blood Phe 
concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a subject’s weight or will 
be a fixed dose. Doses wil l be evaluated on an individual basis.  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range (60-600 µmol/L), the subject may 
be asked t o have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per 
the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject  withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  
•  The subject has completed the study through the Month [ADDRESS_224318]:

Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will be asked to 
continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from 
study participation at any t ime. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, 
and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to 
have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not 
compromise subject safety.

Dose Modifications : 
Dose Increase Methodology
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations.  : 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224320]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows. 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10- fold higher than the subject’s 
current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003,

Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases may occur for hypophenylalanemia or any adverse event that may be improved with a lower dose.  Dose Decrease Methodology  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg or 375, 300, 225, 150, 75, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/week ). It is also 
permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are 
require d in response to safety, dosing frequency may also be adjusted. 
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L), the subject’s rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose. If the condition persists after another

Proprietary and Confidential  7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) is contained in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator 
should review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program for rAvPAL- PEG has characterized the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG using t he intended clinical SC route 
of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of 
PKU. The ENU2 mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, 
including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) 
and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL- PEG administered to male 
ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximately 2000  µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week  3 and Week 7 of dosing. After 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL- PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned as evidenced by [CONTACT_189563] < 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 weeks.  
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG -PAL, two dose interruption assessments were performed:  a 
2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose interrup tion assessments, the animals re -started rAvPAL -PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL- PEG injections were temporarily 
stopped for 2-4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A similar interim attenuated response was observed with the longer dose interruption of approximately 11 weeks.   In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG (Lapis, 2007, ASHG 57th Annual Meeting) . 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) effects were seen with SC administration of rAvPAL -PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were observed in telemetry -instrumented monkeys assessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL -PEG administered subcutaneously. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half -life (t
1/2) values of rAvPAL- PEG administered to 
normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and [ADDRESS_224354] area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) -dose. In the 
cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the t 1/2 was 65  hours at 
4.0 mg/kg, 71  hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest 
dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have 
similar characteristics. The following findings were noted: (1) a 1-compartment model with 
first-order absorption appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL- PEG after 
single -dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after 
SC administratio n to maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), along with a long t 1/2, 
(3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) the AUC and the C
max are roughly linearly proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG was assessed in single -dose and repeat-dose studies in normal 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose rat study, decreased body weight gain and Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the Kupffer cell fi nding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a 
26-week repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and vacuolatio n of the histiocytic cells were observed in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. In a 39 -week repeat -dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid  nodules 
in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this finding was completely reversed after [ADDRESS_224355] -level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL -PEG when administered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells in the rat and arterial inflammation findings in the monkey. 
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan
® or are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  
This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG 
(Study  PAL -002, Study PAL-004, and Study 165-205) based on data from the completed 
clinical study, PAL -001, and clinical experience from this ongoing study and the other 
ongoing Phase [ADDRESS_224356] of rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations. 
The effectiveness of rAvPAL -PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies of 
ENU2 mice was consistent with what was observed in PAL-001. PAL- 001 e nrolled 25 PKU 
subjects with a mean (standard deviation; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 
1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolled into the study were assigned to receive a single administration of rAvPAL -PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects each received 1  of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL- PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL -001 are summarized as follows: 
• rAvPAL -PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood -lowering 
effect on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  
• For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL- PEG, clinically 
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically 
significant decreases from bas eline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3% 
(mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was 1113 µmol/L.  
• Overall, no clinically significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed in 
subjects who were administered rA vPAL-PEG at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003, 
0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg. 
• For subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG at the 3  higher dose levels (0.01, 
0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL-PEG concentration levels, the 
calculated PK parameters were a mean T
max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/[ADDRESS_224357] been designed 
to evaluate rAvPAL -PEG at various doses and dosing regimens to safely achieve and 
maintain blood Phe reductions in subjects with PKU. Currently, there are three ongoing 
Phase 2 studies (PAL-002, PAL-004, 165-205); an overview of each study is presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -002), Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -004), and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (165-205).  - protocol.pdf Page 762

discontinued from the study due to lost to follow-up, relocation, or other reasons, and [ADDRESS_224359] discontinued from the study due to an AE (skin reaction).  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of 
rAvPAL -PEG (ranging from 0.001 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week) on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU with up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondar y 
objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG, to evaluate the immune response to rAvPAL-PEG, and to evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The PAL -002 study design consists of two parts. In Part 1, rAvPAL- PEG was administered 
as a once weekly fixed, low -dose induction regimen for 8 weeks. In Part 2, the rAvPAL- PEG 
dose was titrated upwards; subjects received adjustable dose increases for up to 8  weeks to 
achieve a target blood Phe concentration of 600 µmol/L. The doses and dosing schedules were revised with a series of protocol amendments to incorporate the information gained during conduct of this early, open- label, multiple -dose study.  
A wide range of doses was planned for the PAL-002 study, beginning with doses as low as 0.001mg/kg/week.  However, no substantial reductions in blood Phe level were observed in the majority of subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG in the initial four cohorts at 
doses of 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg administered once per week. The absence of appreciable Phe reduction after 16 weeks of treatment in this range of doses led to a decision to amend the study protocol to include a cohort with a higher starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg /week, which had been previously shown to decrease blood Phe levels to 
approximately 600 µmol/L in the single -dose, Phase 1 study (PAL-001). After the first 
2 weeks of dosing at 0.1 mg/kg/week, transient Phe reduction was observed in this subset of subject s. However, this dosing regimen was accompanied by [CONTACT_189662], suggesting that additional exploration of dosing regimens would be required.  - protocol.pdf Page 763
 PAL -003 A6 Page 32 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  In summary, preliminary results from PAL -002 demonstrated that doses below 0.1 g/kg 
administered once per week were not effective in reducing Phe levels.  While transient 
reduction of Phe was apparent at doses of at least 0.1 mg/kg given once per week, this dose regimen was associated with a high incidence of systemic hypersensitivity reactions, typi[INVESTIGATOR_189399].  Further escalation above this dose of 0.1 mg/kg/week would be required to sustain the effect on Phe levels over time.  Increased doses would require spreading dos e administration over several days per week, as 
once-weekly administration of higher doses would not be practical due to the large volume of study drug.  Therefore, additional dosing regimens would need to be explored in a subsequent study (PAL-004). 
Once subjects completed Study  PAL -002, they were eligible to enroll into this open- label 
extension study, PAL-003 to continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG up to a maximum dose of 
5.0 mg/kg/week or 375 mg/week.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -004 
PAL -004 (An Open- Label Study to Evaluate the  Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
Subcutaneous Dose Levels of rAvPAL- PEG Administered Daily in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in April [ADDRESS_224360] enrolled into this study (PAL -003). One subject withdrew consent from 
continued participation prior to study completion. All subjects enrolled in this study were 
naïve to rAvPAL-PEG exposure. 
The objective o f this study was to determine if daily administration (defined as 5days/week) 
of rAvPAL -PEG at dose levels of 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day was safe and 
effective in reducing and maintaining blood Phe concentrations to 600 µmol/L in subjects 
with PKU. The starting dose was 0.4 mg/kg, administered 5 days/week. A total of 12 subjects were added in sequence and were started on doses of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06 mg, or 0.001/kg/day based on incoming safety data. Overall, subjects in PAL-004 who initiate d treatment at 
higher daily doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/day achieved immediate and substantial reduction of blood Phe levels, but dosing had to be temporarily reduced or interrupted due to the onset of systemic hypersensitivity reactions at approximately Day  [ADDRESS_224361] in the setting of temporary dose reduction or interruption, but Phe levels generally improved if higher dose levels were reinstated.  
To prevent the onset of hypersensitivity reactions that were temporally asso ciated with the 
onset of anti-drug IgM responses, an additional dosing strategy was assessed in PAL-004; - protocol.pdf Page 764
 PAL -003 A6 Page 33 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  4 subjects initiated dosing at a low dose of 0.001mg/kg/day or 0.06mg/kg/day for 
[ADDRESS_224362] the planned dose interruption, suggesting little advantage with this alternate induction regimen.  
Experience from PAL -004 indicated that initiating daily rAvPAL -PEG dosing with relatively 
high daily doses was not sustainable due to the onset of hy persensitivity reactions that 
occurred approximately 9 to 12 days after the start of administration, nor was the alternate dosing regimen (2 week drug holiday) well tolerated or effective in Phe reduction. In addition, the daily treatment regimen did not r educe the time to achieve target blood Phe 
levels seen in previous studies. This study indicated that to improve tolerability, rAvPAL -PEG should be initiated with an induction period at doses substantially lower than 
0.4mg/kg, followed by [CONTACT_189663].   
Once subjects completed Study  PAL -004, they were eligible to enroll into this open- label 
extension study to continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG up to a maximum dose of 5.0 mg/kg/week or 375 mg/week.

Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Subcutaneously Administered rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects 
With PKU for 24 Weeks) was initiated in May 2012. Data from ongoing Studies PAL-002, PAL -004, a nd PAL-003 suggested that a 4- week treatment course with weekly dosing at a 
fixed low dose (induction), followed by a weekly 2-fold, upward titration of rAvPAL- PEG to 
approximately 10-fold higher than the initiation dose (maximum of 375 mg/week) is effecti ve and well tolerated. The objective of this study was to further assess this dosing 
regimen. Two rAvPAL-PEG dosing regimens were to be explored in this study:  weekly low-dose induction (2.5 mg/week for 4 to 8 weeks), followed by a period of upward dose titration towards a target Phe level (600 µmol/L) followed by [CONTACT_189664] 24 week study duration (Group 1).  The other dosing regimen planned for this study (Group 2) involved administration of a single bolus dose of [ADDRESS_224363] 3 weeks duration followed by [CONTACT_189665] a pattern similar to that employed in Group 1. A total of 24 subjects were enrolled into 165-205. In addition to confir ming an effective, well -tolerated

7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited disease characterized by [CONTACT_189448]. Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North America is born with PKU (Scriver,  2001, McGraw- Hill) . Left untreated, PAH deficiency is associated with an 
abnormally elevated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr. ) and can result in a variety of neuropathologic conditions, including mental 
retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities (Scriver,  2001, McGraw- Hill) . The brains of untreated patients with PKU show evidence of 
hypomyelination and gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated Phe during fetal development 
leads to severe mental retardation and can cause microcephaly, growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Koch, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Lee, 2003, 
Pediatrics ), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr. ). 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan
® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of PKU involves adherence to low- Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of  Phe-containing foods. Implementation of a 
Phe-restricted diet in infancy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents many of the neuropathologic manifestations of PKU, including severe mental retardation. However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet ). 
The need exists for a t reatment that will help individuals with PKU safely achieve lifelong, 
reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. rAvPAL- PEG is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have additional clinical benefits.  
Blood Phe levels depend not only on the functional presence of the endogenous enzyme PAH 
but also on the dietary intake of Phe. It is important to understand the role of diet on blood Phe levels concurrent with the administration of rAvPAL- PEG treatment. Therefore, an - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224364] diet are not allowed in 
this study unless per the Investigator. Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.     
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of 
rAvPAL -PEG in up to [ADDRESS_224365] already achieved Phe reduction to within the protocol- defined target range. 
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL-PEG Phase 2 studies. Administration of rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess the long- term safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG 
in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that dat a from previous rAvPAL-PEG studies will change the assumption 
that rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include injection -site reactions and other general symptoms. 
7.4.1 Toxicity Due to Exposure to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 
Acute exposure to high doses of PEG can result in renal toxicity. There have been a few reports of PEG -related AEs in humans; cumulative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, oliguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposur es to PEG in widely 
used medicines and other compounds that are administered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_123001] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG- related toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been assocated with PEG -related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins 
(refer to Section  7.1).  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224366] partially inaccessible by [CONTACT_189666] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab ). In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that 
PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the immunological response (Scott, 1997, 
Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs. ). PEGylation has been effective in 
reducing anti -rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model but does not eliminate antibody 
formation. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL likely reduces the antigenicity of the molecule, 100% of individuals exposed to rAvPAL-PEG develop antibodies against rAvPAL.  
Drug -specific immune responses can range from clinical irrelevance to causing serious  
hypersensitivity AEs (such as anaphylaxis) and may reduce efficacy due to 
antibody- mediated drug clearance or antibody neutralization of enzymatic activity. 
Historically, PEG was thought to be nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.), (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.);  however, repeated studies have found that 
subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous exposure to PEG can induce anti- PEG antibodies 
(Harris,  2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), (Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.). In 
some instances, de velopment of such antibodies did not result in significant clinical effects in 
humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . However, PEG antibody responses 
were associated with hypersensitivity reactions to PEGylated liposomes (Judge, 2006, 
Mol.Ther. ). Anti-PEG antibodies have also been associated with nonresponsiveness against 
therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer ), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther. ). 
Subjects participating in the Phase [ADDRESS_224367] been monitored closely for anti-drug im munogenicity (anti -rAvPAL immunoglobulin G [IgG], anti- rAvPAL IgM, 
anti-PEG IgM, anti -PEG IgG, neutralizing antibodies that inhibit PAL enzymatic activity, 
anti-rAvPAL IgE, and anti -rAvPAL -PEG IgE), complements, C -reactive protein (CRP), 
ESR, and complete chemistry. All subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in the Phase [ADDRESS_224368] 
detected within 2 -3 weeks of treatment initiation and anti- rAvPAL IgG antibodies were 
detected within 2-3 months. The anti-rAvPAL IgG response generally peaked by 3-5 months and was sustained in all subjects. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) capable of inhibiting enzymatic activity were detected in a minority of subjects 2 -3 months after treatment - protocol.pdf Page 768
 PAL -003 A6 Page 37 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  initiation. The timing of the NAb response suggests these antibodies may be a component of 
the anti -rAvPAL IgG response. It is expected that the centralized location of the PAL active 
site, within the tetrameric structure, makes it difficult for antibodies to bind and inhibit 
enzymatic activity. In addition, anti-PAL antibody binding is likely sterically hindered by [CONTACT_189667]. The majority of treated subjects also developed a transient anti- PEG 
antibody response. The anti- PEG response was compr ised of IgM and IgG isotypes. In 
general, anti -PEG antibodies were no longer detected after 5-6 months of treatment. This 
type of transient antibody response is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] T cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) responses. 
The majority of immune -mediated AEs experienced in subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in 
the Phase [ADDRESS_224369] and can lead to the accumulation of complement component 
anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a) that can induce hypersensitivity symptoms. Although IgG immune complexes can also activate the classical complement pathway, they do so with less 
efficiency than IgM. This is due, in part, to the requirement for multiple Fc regions in close proximity to activate the complement cascade, meaning that multiple monomeric IgG Abs are required to bind, whereas only one pentameric IgM Ab is needed to bind to activate complement. Also, in the case of rAvPAL-PEG, binding of anti-PAL IgG antibodies is likely compromised due to epi[INVESTIGATOR_189400], which may reduce IgG- mediated 
comple ment activation in vivo . This complex dynamic between combined isotype- specific 
Ab responses and epi[INVESTIGATOR_189401] a major factor dictating the need for an induction and titration dose regimen in the treatment of rAvPAL- PEG to be imple mented 
in this study.

hypersensitivity rea ctions. Because of the potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for 
emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be within easy access during and - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224371], and N SAIDs approximately 2 -3 hours prior to each dose of study drug for one 
week upon return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. NSAIDs should 
be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.  Subjects who qualify for self-administration of study drug are trained to recognize a serious hypersensitivity AEs and how to respond. Additionally, subjects are given two epi[INVESTIGATOR_189402] (Section 9.4). Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
for instructions regarding resumption of study drug following resolution of symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis per National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria (Sampson, 2006, J.Allergy Clin.Immunol. ).  
In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, subjects may be asked to see an allergist/immunologist and/or provide up to 3 additional blood samples for immunology studies and complement testing. This additional testing may occur up to 6 months following the final study visit.   
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of hypersensitivity reaction symptoms: 
• Maintain the airway.  
• Vital sign check.  
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. 
• Administration of oral or IV glucocorticoids. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment.  
• Transfer t o an acute care facility of the study center.  
In addition, clinical judgment must be used in determining the appropriateness of corticosteroid administration. An allergy and/or immunology consultation should be sought if necessary. Detailed instructions fo r the management of hypersensitivity reactions are

Proprietary and Confidential  9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with 
PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 
studies (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/w eek or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided 
no dose- limiting toxicity was observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG studies. Subjects’ doses 
will not exceed 375 mg/week. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL-PEG study will be enrolled into this study. 
Subjects enrolling into PAL -[ADDRESS_224372] their starting dose determined per the sponsor’s 
medical monitor.  The first week of dosing will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for 30 minutes following administration. Subjects are given t wo 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_189402] (refer to Section  9.4). A  follow- up telephone call will be made to the subject to monitor 
subject safety [ADDRESS_224373] diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be brought to clinic monthly for review with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189668]’s medical monitor and if a dequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set 
of criteria to be considered appropriate for self- administration. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_224374] is introduced, every 24 weeks, and more often as needed. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured 
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. - protocol.pdf Page 772
 PAL -003 A6 Page 41 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of 
subjects in the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvP AL-PEG. Subjects’previous rAvPAL-PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL-003. 
In PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to attain or maintain 
blood Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a 
subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.  Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 9.1.[ADDRESS_224375]’s blood Phe concentration has been 
controlled to within a target range (60 -600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have 
additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor. 
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 98 visit. 
• The study is terminated.  
• The study drug receives marketing authorization. 
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and i nterpretation of study results, every effort should be made 
to retain subjects in the study and to have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety.  
A PK substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in up to 
[ADDRESS_224376] additional pre-dose PK sampling performed (refer to Table 9.1.2).

Proprietary and Confidential  9.1.1 Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout the study and are trained to recognize potential 
hypersensitivity AEs (including anaphylaxis) and how to respond. Subjects are instructed to contact [CONTACT_189660]. The inves tigator may require 
further evaluation at the clinic. If a hypersensitivity AE (eg, injection -site reaction, rash, joint 
pain, itching) occurs, the subject may be advised to premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory  medication (NSAIDs) approximately 
2-3 hours prior to subsequent rAvPAL-PEG doses. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.  
Hypersensitivity AEs, including anaphylaxis, are expected with rAvPAL -PEG 
administration.  rAvPAL- PEG dosing in response to a suspected hypersensitivity AE may be 
modified or halted depending on the severity of the event and suspected rAvPAL- PEG 
causality (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Severity for hypersensitivity AEs will be per NCI- CTCA E 
grades.

Proprietary and Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Respons e to Anaphylaxis 
If the investigator suspects that the event is anaphylaxis, the subject will be assessed in the 
clinic. Laboratory assessments for suspected anaphylaxis events should be performed prior to the next administration of study drug (if applicab le) and include anti-rAvPAL IgE and 
anti-rAvPAL -PEG IgE (sampling must be performed >8 hours after event onset and before 
the next dose of study drug) and tryptase (within 24 hours of event onset). The investigator will consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from study drug, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level. 
For the first week of dosing after resolution of anaphylaxis, the study drug will be 
administered in a clinic setting with equipment for emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within easy access.  The subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224391], and NSAIDs approximately 2-3 hours prior to each dose of study drug for one week upon return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.

9.1.3 Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology  
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions 
regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations. 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224393]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, a nd 5.0 mg/kg or 
2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375 mg/week) or per Investigator determination 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events for an individual subject.
 Dose increases  > 350 mg/week 
require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg or 375 mg/week. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224394] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. - protocol.pdf Page 781
 PAL -003 A6 Page 50 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology  
Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a 
subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse event (any hypersensitivity reaction as defined in Section  9.1.1). Dose decreases may occur for hypophenylalanemia or 
any adverse event that may be improved with a lower dose.  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg or 375, 300, 225, 150, 75, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/week). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required in response to safety, dosing frequency may also be adjusted.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L ), the 
subject’s rAvPAL-PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224395] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician).

It is preferable that the injection sites should be alternated between doses, ie, upper left arm 
in Week 1, upper right arm in Week 2, etc. Doses may be administered in any of the common SC areas (upper arm, thigh, abdomen). If dose volume is such that a dose will be divided and given in more than 1 injection site, it is preferable to use both arms, both legs, or both sides of the abdomen. 
Subjects may require more than 1 injection per dose, depending upon site policy (ie, some 
institutions do not permi t a single SC injection of greater than 2  mL).  Dosage calculations 
must be performed according to study drug preparation instructions provided in the PAL-[ADDRESS_224411] Self-Admini stration Training Materials.

This will be an open-label study; no randomization schedule will be generated. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224412] number used in their previous rAvPAL- PEG study.  
9.4.6 Selection of Doses Used in the Study  
This Phase 2 study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK parameters of 
multiple doses of rAvPAL- PEG after long -term administration in subjects with PKU. A  dose 
that produces a reduction in blood Phe concentrations to 60-600 μmol/L will be determined for each subject based on preliminary safety, antibody, and efficacy data from this ongoing study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_189572]. 
Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_456]’s medical 
monitor and if adequate training is provided (refer to Section 9.4).

9.4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications taken by a subject for 30 days 
before Screening will be recorded on the designated CRF. The Investigator may prescribe additional medications during the study, as long as the prescribed medication is not prohibited by [CONTACT_760]. In the event of an emergency, any needed medications may be prescribed without prior approval, but the sponsor’s medical monitor must be notified of the use of any contraindicated medic ations immediately thereafter. Any concomitant medications 
added or discontinued during the study should be recorded on the CRF. 
Use of any investigational product (with the exception of rAvPAL-PEG used in a previous 
rAvPAL -PEG study) or investigational me dical device within 30 days before Screening, or 
requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments, is prohibited. 
Use or planned use of any injectable drugs containing PEG (other than rAvPAL- PEG), 
including D epo-Provera, is prohibited within [ADDRESS_224414] will be encouraged to be premedicate as outlined in Section 9.1.1. If 
the hypersensitivity AE worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_189673]’s medical monitor) even with premedication prior to study drug - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224415] may pa rticipate in this study (refer to Section  9.3.2).  
Use of any medication that is intended to treat PKU within [ADDRESS_224416] decision or per the Investigator. After a dosing interruption of ≥ four consecutive doses, rAvPAL-PEG administration should be re- started at the same dose level and dosing 
frequency that was administered prior to the dosing interruption. The first week of dosing of rAvPAL -PEG foll owing a dose interruption should be administered in a clinic setting, and 
the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224417], and non- steroidal anti-
inflammatory me dication (NSAIDs) approximately 2 -3 hours prior to study drug should be 
administered follo wing any dose interruption of ≥ four consecutive doses. NSAIDs should be 
given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated. A follow-up telephone call will be made to the subject to monitor subject safety 24 hours following the return to dosing. Subjects should continue to perform the study assessments as outlined in the Schedule of Events (refer to Table 9.1.1) during any dosing interruption.  
Subjects who miss rAvPAL-PEG dosing due to poor compliance may be discontinued from 
further study treatment per discretion of the Sponsor or Investigator (refer to Section 9.3.3).

Proprietary and Confidential  10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Adve rse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g.,  sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study -drug or 
other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577] . 
• Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study-drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis. 
The study AE reporting period is as follows:
 After informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported.  After informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug, all non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until [ADDRESS_224428] administration of study drug or the early termination visit, whichever is longer (refer to Section 12). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of SAEs is provided in 
Section  10.2.   
For this study, a medical device is defined as the prefilled syringe and all of the component parts.  The reporting period for device- related events begins with the first dose administered 
using prefilled syringe and ends with the last dose administered using prefilled syringe. Events assessed by [CONTACT_189674], including malfun ction, injury, or 
medication error, will be captured into an electronic data capture system. All serious events related to the device will be reported to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV) within 24 hours using the device- related event report form and entered onto the appropriate eCRF page(s) as 
required.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224429] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treatment or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Outcome of AEs (and resolution dates) should be 
documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record unless the subject is lost to follow -up or it has been determined that the study treatment or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. 
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AEs for severity, relationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see  Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening : 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189411]; disabling; 
limiting self care activities of daily living (ADL)b 
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs . 
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the 
toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224430] it 
on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to  the IP has not occurred  
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in 
time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the IP; that is, there are no facts [evidence] or ar guments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP.  
Possibly Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189578].  
Probably Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189579].  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189580], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology).  
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life threatening.  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Important medical events or reactions that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189412]. - protocol.pdf Page 801
 PAL -003 A6 Page 70 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  For this protocol, anaphylaxis per NIAID/FAAN criteria for the clinical diagnosis of 
anaphylaxis is designated as an AE of special interest (serious or nonserious and irrespective of severity) to facilitate rapid reporting and sponsor review. Al l occurrences of anaphylaxis 
per NIAID/FAAN criteria will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event using the SAE form. Severity and serious criteria (if applicable) should be reported on the SAE form. 
The reporting period for SAEs related to protocol imposed interventions begins after 
informed consent is obtained, the reporting period for all SAEs begins after first dose of study drug and continues until [ADDRESS_224431] administered dose. 
All SAEs (including serious device-related events), whether or not considered related to 
study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event by [CONTACT_189581]-specific SAE Report Form or device Report Form to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). Each SAE must also be reported in the CRF Investigators should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463].  The Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study treat ment or participation 
is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented in the CRF and in the subject’s medical record. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate 
the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report). 
At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study partici pation if felt to be related to prior 
study treatment. The Sponsor should also be notified if the Investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that participated in this study.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224432] through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or 
termination) and to report the resolution to BPV in the study reference materials. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected health information. 
10.[ADDRESS_224433] the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/2 0/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the 
occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
• Immediate need to revise the IP administration (i.e., modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol). - protocol.pdf Page 803
 PAL -003 A6 Page 72 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  • Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management. 
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety

Proprietary and Confidential  14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMP LE SIZE 
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency and percent, while continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical analysis.  
14.[ADDRESS_224443] postdose safety information will be included in the safety analyses. 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology (MedDRA) will be used by 
[CONTACT_189675] (CRF).  
The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. A by–subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a serious AE (SAE), including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawal from the study or study drug. Hypersensitivity AEs and AEs that result in dosing interruption or dose level reduction are of interest, and the percentage of subjects who report these AEs will be presented.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. Frequency and percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference range) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post- treatme nt visits. Changes from baseline to the 
post- treatment visits will also be provided. Descriptive statistics of vital signs, physical 
examination results, ECG results, and X- ray results, and immunogenicity test results will also 
be provided. Additionally, a ntibodies and titers will be summarized by [CONTACT_51256].

accumulation should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added f or PK analysis 
as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor. 
14.3.[ADDRESS_224445]- treatment efficacy data will be included in the e fficacy analysis.  
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration from baseline (to be defined in the SAP) to each scheduled ti me point and presence/absence 
of antibodies will also be summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe concentrations of 60 -600 µmol/L will be summarized by [CONTACT_189594]. 
The relationship of dietary Phe intake (per information reported on the subject diet diary) and 
blood Phe concentration will also be explored. Subjects who received any amount of study drug with any post-treatment blood Phe concentration measurements and diet diary information will be inclu ded in this exploratory analysis.  
Details regarding exploratory analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
14.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Subjects who participated in previous rAvPAL-PEG studies may be enrolled into this study. No formal sa mple size calculation was conducted for this study or the PAL-003 Substudy.   
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
All analyses will be presented based on observed data only. Missing data will not be imputed for analyses unless sensitivity analyses are warranted. If i mputations are used, detailed 
imputation methods will be described in the SAP before locking the database. - protocol.pdf Page 814
 PAL -003 A6 Page 83 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  14.7 Interim Analyses  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study on an ongoing basis (refer to Section 15 f or 
information regarding the DMC). 
14.[ADDRESS_224446]’s safety is compromised without immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB must be so ught, and the 
Investigator should inform BioMarin and the full IRB within [ADDRESS_224447] again provide informed consent. 
Note: If discrepancies exist between the text of the statistical analysis as planned in the 
protocol, and the final SAP, a protocol amendment will not be issued and the SAP will prevail.  - protocol.pdf Page 815

Proprietary and Confidential  15 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE (DMC)  
The DMC will act independently in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the safety 
of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who participate in the study.  
The responsibilities of the DMC are to:  
• Review the study protocol, informed consent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, subjects’ risk versus benefit, and other factors that 
could affect the study outcome. 
• Assess the effect and relevance of new external evidence.  
• Consider relevant information that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189370] 9.1.2. 
• Make recommendations to the BioMarin concerning continuation or termination of the study or other study modifications based on observations. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224448]’s disease, that are not part of this study. Costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and treatments s hould be billed and collected in the way that such 
costs are usually billed and collected.  
The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre- specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subject should be gi ven the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance with, treatment for study- related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medi cal treatment, unless the executed Clinical Trial Agreement 
between BioMarin and the institution of the investigator specifies otherwise. If the subject has followed the Investigator’s instructions, BioMarin may pay for reasonable and necessary medical ser vices to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533] -related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224449] be completed using a web–based app lication that has been validated. Study site 
personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will correct the value by [CONTACT_187698]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the site personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to  allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized 
representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent.  
A CRA desi gnated by [CONTACT_189630] 
“source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is 
needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to clos e the query or re–query 
the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, all data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying that the information on the CRFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the clinical study report for the entire study, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224450] the monitors.

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_189300], study site facilities, original source documentation, and all study files.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224451] notify BioMarin of any change in the location, disposition or custody of the study files. The PI/institution must take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (e.g., subject charts) as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_25435].  
All study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_224452] approval of a marketing application in the U.S. or an ICH region and until (1) there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in the [LOCATION_002] or an ICH region or (2) at least [ADDRESS_224453] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. The PI/institution should retain subject identifiers for at least [ADDRESS_224454] with retention should the PI/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full 15 years. It is the responsibility of BioMarin to inform the PI/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224455] poly(ethylene glycol)

(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Severity for hypersensitivity AEs will be per NCI -CTCAE grades.  
Subjects who had a previous systemic reaction to rAvPAL PEG or a PEG containing pr oduct that warranted early termination from a 
previous rAvPAL PEG study are excluded from participation in this study. Subjects who have had a previous local skin reaction to 
rAvPAL PEG in a previous rAvPAL PEG study are eligible to participate in this stu dy. Subjects who have had a previous reaction and are 
deemed eligible for participation must be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or non sedating antihistamines [ADDRESS_224471] is accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).  Subjects may develop systemic, large local

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Local Skin Reactions  
All subjects who experience a local skin reaction during this study may be premedicated orally with acetaminophen and/or non sedating 
antihistamines 1 2 hours prior to study drug dosing (subjects may take non sedating pre medications prior to coming to clinic) for all future 
study doses. Recommended premedications are acetaminophen and/or non sedating antihistamine. The dosage will be standard. Subjects 
must be accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable) because anti histamines can cause drowsiness. Symptoms of local reactions may 
be treated with local application of ice and non sedating oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_189327]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (refer to Section 7.4.3).  
If the local skin reaction worsens with a repeat  injection (as determined by [CONTACT_116333]’s Medical 
Officer) even with premedication prior to study drug dosing, the subject must be withdrawn from study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Large Local Skin Reactions  
Large local skin reactions (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition) may or may not be contiguous to the rAvPAL PEG injection site, and 
subjects with either type of large local skin reaction may continue dosing if the skin symptoms have resolved and no other sy mptoms hav e 
developed. Subjects will be encouraged to premedicate orally with acetaminophen and/or non sedating antihistamines 1 2 hours prior to 
study drug dosing (subjects may take non sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all future study doses.  
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, or IV antihistamines a nd/or steroids as 
needed (refer to Section 7.4.3).

remainder of the study, subjects will be encouraged to premedicate orally with acetaminophen and/or non sedating antihistamines 1 2 
hours prior to study drug dosing (subjects may take non sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for all future stu dy doses. 
Because antihistamines can cause drowsiness, it may be administered only if the subject is accompanied by a designated driver  (if 
applicable).  
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral,  or IV antihistamines and/or steroids as

[IP_ADDRESS].2.2 Large Local Skin Reactions Not Contiguous to Injection Site  
Large local skin reactions that are not contiguous to the injection site may be associated with a low risk of  systemic symptoms or 
anaphylaxis upon re exposure to rAvPAL PEG and, therefore, will be managed as a systemic reaction (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].3). An 
example of a large local reaction that is not contiguous to the injection site is if an injection took place in the right upper arm and there are 
lesions beyond the elbow joint in the right forearm or lesions beyond the shoulder joint on the right trunk.  
Symptoms of large local skin reactions may be treated with local application of ice and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, o r IV antihistamines and/or steroids as 
needed (refer to Section 7.4.3).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Systemic Reactions  
Subjects who experience a systemic reaction (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for a definition) after administration of rAvPAL PEG must stop 
further administration s of rAvPAL PEG and must immediately return to the clinic for safety assessments. Subjects who experience 
generalized skin symptoms are included in this category. Immediately after the systemic reaction (within 24  hours), subjects with 
generalized skin sym ptoms must have additional assessments performed for safety (ie, Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction Visit): 
serum antibodies (anti PAL IgG, anti PAL IgM, anti PEG IgG, anti PEG IgM, anti rAvPAL PEG IgE, anti rAvPAL PEG neutralizing 
antibodies); serum tr yptase level (it is recommended that this sample be drawn immediately after reaction); urine albumin/creatinine ratio; 
urine N methyl histamine; CRP, CH50, C 1, C3, and C 4; skin biopsy (optional; affected and not affected area; to be performed within 1 week  
of reaction); and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology; refer to Figure [IP_ADDRESS].1.  
Following the reaction, subjects will be required to complete the assessments of the Unscheduled Hypersensitivity Reaction vi sit, including 
assessm ent of IgE. If a subject presents with a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis, further dosing will be held while laboratory eval uation of 
IgE, as part of the Unscheduled Systemic Reaction Visit, is performed.  Subjects may resume study drug administration per  the discretion 
of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s Medical Officer; however, if subject was dosing at home, they will be require d to come into - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224473] week of resumed dosing. Subjects will be encouraged to premedicate ora lly with

to clinic) for all future study doses. Additionally, subjects must be closely monitored for [ADDRESS_224474] be accompanied by a designated driver (if applicable).   
If blood Phe concentrations are not 60 600 µmol/L following 1  week of daily administration at the lowered dose cohort and there is no 
further evidence of toxicity (ie,  another systemic reaction attributed to rAvPAL PEG administration or clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory test results), the  subject may be administered the next highest dose level in the clinic per the allowable dose increases outlined in 
Section  8.1.2 . Subjects will be encouraged to premedicate orally with acetaminophen and/or antihistamines 1 2 hours prior to study drug 
dosing (subjects may take non sedating premedications prior to coming to clinic) for  all future study doses. Additionally, subjects must be

 Rationale #13:  
Revision and update to the rAvPAL- PEG immunogenicity profile; additional information characterizing specific antibody 
responses detected in subjects  
7.4.[ADDRESS_224485] ug (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab ). In vivo and in vitro experiments have 
shown that PEGylation of proteins and cells  can attenuate the immunological response (Scott, 1997, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A ), (Chen, 2001, 
BioDrugs. ). PEGylation has been effective in reducing anti -rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model , although PEGylation but does not 
eliminate antibody formati on. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL may have a significant effect on reducing likely reduces  the 
immunogenicity antigenicity  of the molecule, it is reasonable to expect that some 100% of  individuals may exhibit exposed to rAvPAL -PEG 
develop antibodies against rAvPAL.  
Drug -specific  immune responses upon exposure  can range from clinical irrelevance  to the  causing serious hypersensitivity AEs (such as 
anaphylaxis) and may reduce efficacy due to antibody -mediated  drug. These immune responses may be clinically irrel evant, cause symptoms of 
various degrees,  clearance  or lead to  antibody  neutralization of biological  enzymatic
As of May 2012, a total of [ADDRESS_224486] been administered rAvPAL PEG in the single dose, Phase 1 study (PAL 001) and in the repeat 
dosing Phase 2 studies (PAL 002, PAL 004, and PAL 003). The dose levels in the repeat dosing studies range from 0.001 to 5.0  mg/kg/week 
administered in various frequencies (including 5 days a week). The most clinically significant AEs have been hypersensitivity  reactions that have 
led to dosing interruptions and reductions. Most of the hypersensitivity re actions have been nonserious and mild tomoderate in severity.   activity .  Subjects participating in clinical trials will be 
monitored closely with specific antibody titers sedimentation rates, and complete bl ood counts (CBCs).  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224487] been reported as related to rAvPAL PEG. 
Two of the study drug related SAEs occurred in Study P AL001. Both of these SAEs occurred in subjects in the lower dose cohorts: an SAE of 
hypersensitivity reaction in a subject in the 0.001  mg/kg cohort and an SAE of anaphylactic reaction (urticaria) in a subject in the 0.01  mg/kg 
cohort . Neither SAE was sev ere or resulted in discontinuation from the study, and both of the SAEs resolved. There were no SAEs in subjects in 
the higher dose cohorts (0.03 mg/kg and 0.1mg/kg) in PAL 001. The third study drug related SAE (angioedema) occurred in a subject in Study 
PAL004. The fourth SAE (urticaria, dehydration) was reported as not related to study drug and occurred in a subject in Study PAL 002.  There 
have been no reports of anaphylaxis for any subject treated with rAvPEG PAL (as of January 2012).  
Subjects who hav e a systemic clinical reaction at any time during this study may undergo a series of assessments to monitor safety, including  
assessment of complements, C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and IgE antibodies.  Reintroduction of rAvPAL PEG 
dosing after a reaction will depend on clinical assessments and available laboratory data, such as chemistry and urine studie s, to ensure that there 
has been no end organ damage prior to resuming treatment with rAvPAL PEG. As of May 2012, antibo dy titers, including positive IgE titers, have 
not been predictive of future clinical reactions when dosing with rAvPAL -PEG.  Additionally, subjects may be premedicated to prevent or 
mitigate risk of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].3).  
PEG itself is considered nonimmunogenic Historically, PEG was thought to be nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol. ), (Harris, 2003, 
Nat.Rev.Drug Discov. ); however, repeated studies have found that subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous exposure to PEG can induce anti PEG 
antibodies (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov. ) however, antibodies against PEG may form when PEG is bound to compounds. (Richter, 1983, 
Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol. ). In some instances, development of such antibodies did not result i n significant clinical effects in humans 
(Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol. ) .  In some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in any significant clinical 
effects in humans . However, PEG antibody responses were associated wit h hypersensitivity reactions to PEGylated liposomes (Judge, 2006, 
Mol.Ther. ).In some individuals, anti PEG antibodies may be pre existing due to previous exposure to PEG in other products. Anti PEG antibodies 
have also been associated with nonresponsivenes s against therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer ), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther. ) .  
Administration of rAvPAL PEG may lead to anti PEG antibody formation, and the duration of this possible effect is not known. Subjects in the 
Phase [ADDRESS_224488]’s future 
ability to be treated with other PEG containing (eg,  Depo Provera) or PEGylated (eg,  PEG interferon) injectable drugs. It is therefore 
recommended tha t any PEG containing injectable drug administered to subjects after completion of this study be done under medical observation.  
Systemic Skin Reactions  
Two out of 25 subjects who were enrolled in Study PAL 001 and received the protocol defined single dose of rAvPAL PEG reported systemic 
skin reactions (generalized skin rash) that were attributed to treatment with study drug. One subject received a single dose of 0.001  mg/kg 
rAvPAL PEG, and the other subject received a single dose of 0.01  mg/kg rAvPAL PEG. O ne of these events was reported as serious, and the 
other was reported as nonserious; both events were reported following administration of Depo -Provera injections (medroxyprogesterone injection), 
an injectable contraception. These allergic reactions are t hought to be related to the PEG molecules that are found in both the study drug, rAvPAL- protocol.pdf Page 837

Proprietary and Confidential  PEG, and Depo Provera. These reactions are not likely to be experienced concurrent with other birth control medications.  
The 2 subjects were administered study drug dur ing PAL 001 and then experienced an allergic reaction following an injection of Depo Provera. 
The symptoms of the reactions were hives on the arms and legs and difficulty breathing. The symptoms for both subjects resolv ed within 1  day 
following treatment w ith medication, including the antihistamine Benadryl (diphenhydramine). Both subjects were examined by [CONTACT_189680] 001. A skin prick test with Depo Provera was administered as part of this examination. On e 
subject had a mild allergic reaction to the test; however, no further reactions or complications were reported following subs equent administration 
of a full dose of Depo Provera. Upon study completion, the subject continued to receive regular doses (ever y 3 months) of Depo Provera, and no 
further reactions were reported. The second subject also had a positive reaction to Depo Provera following administration of the skin prick test. 
When a subsequent full dose of Depo Provera was administered, develope d hives, itching, and chills. The subject’s symptoms resolved within 
[ADDRESS_224489] 
basis for these reported events and their duration is not known, the use of PEG containing injectable drugs prior to, during, and  after this study is 
prohibited as a precautionary measure (refer to Section 9.3.2 and Section 9.4.8).  
Subjects participating in the Phase [ADDRESS_224490] been monitored closely for anti -drug immunogenicity (anti -rAvPAL immunoglobulin G 
[IgG], anti -rAvPAL IgM, anti -PEG IgM, anti -PEG IgG, neutralizing antibodies that inhibit PAL enzymatic activity, anti -rAvPAL IgE, and anti -
rAvPAL -PEG IgE), complements, C -reactive protein (CRP), ESR, and complete chemistry. All subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in the Phase [ADDRESS_224491] detected within 2 -3 weeks of treatment 
initiation and anti -rAvPAL IgG antibodies were detected within 2 -3 months. The anti -rAvPAL IgG response generally peaked by 3 -5 months and 
was sustained in all subjects. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) capable of inhibiting enzymatic activity were detected in a minority of subjects 2 -3 
months after treatment initiation. The timing of the NAb response suggests thes e antibodies may be a component of the anti -rAvPAL IgG 
response. It is expected that the centralized location of the PAL active site, within the tetrameric structure, makes it difficult for antibodies to bind 
and inhibit enzymatic activity. In addition, an ti-PAL antibody binding is likely sterically hindered by [CONTACT_189667]. The majority of 
treated subjects also developed a transient anti -PEG antibody response. The anti -PEG response was comprised of IgM and IgG isotypes. In 
general, anti -PEG antibodies were no longer detected after 5 -6 months of treatment. This type of transient antibody response is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] T cell -
independent type 2 (TI -2) responses.  - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_224492] and can lead to the accumulation of complement component 
anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a) that can induce hypersensitivity symptoms . Although IgG immune complexes can also activate the classical 
complement pathway, they do so with less efficiency than IgM. This is due, in part, to the requirement for multiple Fc regions in close proximity 
to activate the complement cascade, meaning that multiple monomeric IgG Abs are required to bind, whereas only one pentameric IgM Ab is 
needed to bind to activate complement. Also, in the case of rAvPAL -PEG, binding of anti -PAL IgG antibodies is likely compromised due to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_189400], which may reduce IgG -mediated complement activation in vivo . This complex dynamic between combined 
isotype -specific Ab responses and epi[INVESTIGATOR_189401] a major factor dictating the need for an induction and titration dose 
regimen in the treatment of rAvPAL -PEG to be implemented in this study.  - protocol.pdf Page 839

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY  
Amendment:  3 
Date: [ADDRESS_224494] of all significant changes and supporting rationale.  
1. Collection of skin reaction data is being added to aid in assessment of skin reaction 
adverse events (AEs). The Skin Reaction electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) should 
be completed for skin reactions that last 14 days or longer. Photographs of the skin 
reactions may also be collected . 
2. Additional information about subjects who are trying to conceive, are pregnant, 
and/or breastfeed during the study has been added. Subjects must stop study drug administration if trying to conceive, are pregnant, and/or are breastfeeding. Because 
of the long- term nature of this study, subjects may re -start study drug following birth 
and cessation of breastfeeding (if applicable) per the investigator and the sponsor. 
Information regarding contraception use has also been added . 
3. The inclu sion criterion regarding contraception use for subjects who are sexually 
active has been revised. Subjects must now use two acceptable methods of contraception while participating in the study to align with the contraception requirements in the Phase 3 studies.  
4. The study duration has been extended from 98 months to 102 months. 
5. The AE reporting period has been clarified; nonserious AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) should continue to be reported through [ADDRESS_224495] dose of study drug or the Study Complet ion Visit/Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs last. 
6. Minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency. 
 
In addition, the Schedule of Events and Section [ADDRESS_224496] the cha nges

Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open- Label Dose -Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL -PEG in Subjects with PKU  
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL -003 
STUDY SITES :  Approximately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT :  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE : 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional 
outcomes. PEGylated recombinant Anabaena va riabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) 
is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in 
individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have 
additional clinical bene fits. This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase [ADDRESS_224498] diet are not allowed in this study unless per the Investigator. Diet  will be 
monitored using a diet diary. 
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in 
up to [ADDRESS_224499] already achieved Phe reduction to within 
the protocol-defined target range.  This substudy has been completed as of 20 December 2013. - protocol.pdf Page 847

OBJECTIVES : 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long -term administration of multiple doses of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the immune response to long- term administration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentr ation 
following administration with rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows: 
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who have achieved and maintained 
target blood Phe concentration and for whom no further dose modifications are planned.  
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN : 
This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL-PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with PKU. The 
doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 studies (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided no dose- limiting toxicity is 
observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG study. Subjects’ doses will not exceed 375 mg/week. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL -PEG study will be enrolled into this study. Subjects 
enrolling into PAL -[ADDRESS_224501] their 
starting dose determined per the sponsor’s medical monitor. The first dose will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224502] to monitor - protocol.pdf Page 848

Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189659]’s 
medical monitor and if adequate training is demonstr ated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be 
considered appropriate for self-administration.  Additional training will be provided to subjects and 
demonstration of competency required when prefilled syringe drug product is introduced, every 
24 weeks, and more often as needed. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
version  4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’ previous rAvPAL-PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL- 003. In 
PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to attain or maintain blood Phe 
concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be base d on either a subject’s weight or will 
be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range (60-600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per 
the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
A subject will c ontinue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  
•  The subject has completed the study through the Month 98 visit. 
•  The study is terminated.  - protocol.pdf Page 849

AUTHORITY USE ONLY:  
• The study drug receives marketing authorization.  
Because the risks of taking rAvPAL -PEG during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown, subjects 
cannot take rAvPAL -PEG if they are trying to conceive, are pregnan t, or are breastfeeding. Male 
subjects who are planning to impregnate a female partner and female subjects who are trying to 
become pregnant during the study will be discontinued immediately from study drug. Male subjects 
who have impregnated a female partner may re-start study drug after conception but must return  to the 
study- required contraception use , which must include one barrier method. Subjects who remain in the 
study after discontinuation of study drug due to pregnancy may re- introduce rAvPAL -PEG d osing 
after the birth has been reported (or termination of the pregnancy) and breastfeeding has completed (if 
applicable) or after the subject is no longer actively trying to conceive. Re- starting rAvPAL -PEG 
dosing must be per investigator and sponsor agre ement based on an assessment of the known risks and 
potential benefits while taking BMN 165. Female subjects must return to the study-required 
contraception use, which must include one barrier method, immediately after the birth (or termination 
of the pregnancy). 
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will be asked to 
continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from 
study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to 
have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not 
compromise subject safety.

(any hypersensitivity reaction) for an individual subject. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week 
requi re consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg or 375 mg/week.  Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require consultation 
with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224508] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be

Safety Assessment Criteria : 
Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout the study and are tra ined to recognize potential 
hypersensitivity AEs (including anaphylaxis) and how to respond. Subjects are instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_189660]. The investigator may require further evaluation at the clinic. If a hype rsensitivity AE (eg, injection -site reaction, rash, joint pain, itching) occurs, the 
subject may be advised to premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) approximately 2 -3 hours prior to  subseque nt rAvPAL -PEG 
doses. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.  
Hypersensitivity AEs, including anaphylaxis, are expected with rAvPAL -PEG administration. 
rAvPAL -PEG  dosing in response to a suspected hypersensitivity AE may be mo dified or halted 
depending on the severity of the event and suspected rAvPAL -PEG causality. Severity for 
hypersensitivity AEs will be per NCI -CTCAE gr ades. 
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189418]  ≥ 3 hypersensitivity AE that is related to study drug and is 
suspected to meet Brown’s criteria for severe (grade 3) in the judgment of the investigator and the 
sponsor’s medical monitor may be permanently discontinued from study drug.  
Dosing in Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Dosing in response to a hypersensitivity AE depends on the NCI- CTCAE grade and suspected 
relationship to rAvPAL -PEG .  
Once an AE (other than anaphylaxis) improves to grade 1 or resolves, study drug dose may be 
increased, maintained, or reduced. If dosing has been interrupted due to an AE (other than 
anaphylaxis) and the investigator determines it is safe for the subject to resume dosing, the first dose 
after improvement of the AE should be performed in the clinic. The subject must be observed for 
[ADDRESS_224512], and NSAIDs approximately 2-3 hours prior to subsequent rAvPAL -PEG  doses. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not 
tolerated. - protocol.pdf Page 852

Response to Anaphylaxis  
If the investigator suspects that the event is anaphylaxis, the subject will be assessed in the clinic. Laboratory assessments for suspected anaphylaxis even ts should be performed prior to the next 
administration of study drug (if applicable) and include anti-rAvPAL IgE and anti- rAvPAL -PEG IgE 
(sampling must be performed >8 hours after event onset and before the next dose of study drug) and 
tryptase (within 24  hours of event onset). The investigator will consult with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from study drug, restart 
dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level.  
For the first week of dosing after resolution of anaphylaxis, the study drug will be administered in a clinic setting with equipment for emergency resuscitation  (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within easy access.  
The subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224514], and NSAIDs 
approximately 2-3 hours prior to each dose of study drug for one week upon return to dosing 
regardless of the duratio n of dose interruption. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted 
if not tolerated.   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] : 
If an NCI -CTCAE grade  ≥ 3 hypersensitivity treatment -related event occurs and meets Brown’s 
criteria for severe (grade 3), an ad hoc independ ent DMC meeting will convene within [ADDRESS_224515]. Clinically severe 
hypersensitivity is defined as significant hypoxia, hypotension or neurologic compromise that is 
life-threatening or required treatment to prevent a life- threatening event:  
• Cyanosis or SpO 2 ≤ 92%  
• Hypotension with SBP < 90 mm Hg (adults)

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) is contained in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator 
should review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program for rAvPAL- PEG has characterized the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG using the intended clinical SC route 
of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of 
PKU. The ENU2 mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, 
including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) 
and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL- PEG administered to male 
ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximately 2000  µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week  3 and Week 7 of dosing. After 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL- PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned as evidenced by [CONTACT_189563] < 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 weeks.  
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG -PAL, two dose interruption assessments were performed:  a 
2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose interruption assessments, the animals re -started rAvPAL -PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL- PEG injections were temporarily 
stopped for 2-4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A similar interim attenuated response was observed with the longer dose interruption of approximately 11 weeks.   In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG  (Lapis, 2007, ASHG 57th Annual Meeting). 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) effects were seen with SC administration of rAvPAL -PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were observed in telemetry -instrumented monkeys assessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL -PEG administered subcutaneously. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half -life (t
1/2) values of rAvPAL- PEG administered to 
normal rat s at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and 44 hours, respectively, - protocol.pdf Page 870
 PAL -003 A7 Page 27 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: [ADDRESS_224540] area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) -dose. In the 
cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the t 1/2 was 65  hours at 
4.0 mg/ kg, 71 hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest 
dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have 
similar characteristics. The following findings were noted: (1)  a 1-compartment model with 
first-order absorption appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL- PEG after 
single -dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after 
SC administration to maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), along with a long t 1/2, 
(3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) the AUC and the C
max are roughly linearly proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG was assessed in single -dose and repeat-dose studies in norma l 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose rat study, decreased body weight gain and Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the Kupffer cell finding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a 26-week repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and vacuolation of the histiocytic cells were observed in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. In a 39 -week repeat -dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid nodules in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this finding was completely reversed after [ADDRESS_224541] -level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL -PEG when administered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells in the rat and arterial inflammation findings in the monkey. 
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subjects 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan
® or are n ot compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  
This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG 
(Study  PAL -002, Study PAL-004, and Study 165-205) based on data from the completed 
clinical study, PAL -001, and clinical experience from this ongoing study and the other 
ongoing Phase 2 studies, PAL-002 and PAL-004.  - protocol.pdf Page 871
PAL -003 A7 Page 28 
Proprietary and Confidential Amendment 7: [ADDRESS_224542] of rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations. 
The effectiveness of rAvPAL -PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies of 
ENU2 mice was consistent with what was observed in PAL-001. PAL-001 enrolled 25 PKU subjects with a mean (standard deviation; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolled into the study were assigned to receive a single administration of rAvPAL -PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects each received 1  of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL- PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL -001 are summarized as follows: 
•rAvPAL -PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood -lowering
effect on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.
•For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL- PEG, clinically
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically
significant decreases from baseline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3%(mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was1113 µmol/L.
•Overall, no clinically significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed in
subjects who were administered rAvPAL -PEG at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003,
0.01, and 0.03 mg /kg.
•For subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG at the 3  higher dose levels (0.01,
0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL-PEG concentration levels, the
calculated PK parameters were a mean T
max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/[ADDRESS_224543] been designed 
to evaluate rAvPAL -PEG at various doses and dosing regimens to safely achieve and 
maintain blood Phe reductions in subjects with PKU. Currently, there are three ongoing Phase 2 studies (PAL-002, PAL-004, 165-205); an overview of each study is presented in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -002), Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -004), and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (165-205).  - protocol.pdf Page 872

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 [IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -002 
Study PAL -002 (A Phase 2, Open -Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Efficacy, and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL- PEG in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in September [ADDRESS_224544] completed the study. PAL -002 enrolled 11 previously exposed subjects from the single-dose study, PAL- 001, and 
29 subjects who were naïve to rAvPAL- PEG. Thirty -three of the 37 subjects who completed 
PAL -002 enrolled into this open-label extension study (PAL-003). Two subjects 
discontinued from the study due to lost to follow-up, relocation, or other reasons, and [ADDRESS_224545] discontinued from the study due to an AE (skin reaction).  
The primary objective of this study was to eva luate the effect of multiple doses of 
rAvPAL -PEG (ranging from 0.001 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week) on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU with up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary 
objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG, to evaluate the immune response to rAvPAL-PEG, and to evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The PAL -002 study design consists of two parts. In Part 1, rAvPAL- PEG was administered 
as a once weekly fixed, low -dose induction regimen for 8 weeks. In Part 2, the rAvPAL- PEG 
dose was titrated upwards; subjects received adjustable dose increases for up to 8  weeks to 
achieve a target blood Phe concentration of 600 µmol/L. The doses and  dosing schedules 
were revised with a series of protocol amendments to incorporate the information gained during conduct of this early, open- label, multiple -dose study.  
A wide range of doses was planned for the PAL-002 study, beginning with doses as low a s 
0.001mg/kg/week.  However, no substantial reductions in blood Phe level were observed in the majority of subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG in the initial four cohorts at 
doses of 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg administered once per week. The absence of appreciable Phe reduction after 16 weeks of treatment in this range of doses led to a decision to amend the study protocol to include a cohort with a higher starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg/week, which had been previously shown to decrease blood Phe l evels to 
approximately 600 µmol/L in the single -dose, Phase 1 study (PAL-001). After the first 
2 weeks of dosing at 0.1 mg/kg/week, transient Phe reduction was observed in this subset of subjects. However, this dosing regimen was accompanied by [CONTACT_189682], suggesting that additional exploration of dosing regimens would be required.  - protocol.pdf Page 873
 PAL -003 A7 Page 30 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 In summary, preliminary results from PAL -002 demonstrated that doses below 0.1 g/kg 
administered once per  week were not effective in reducing Phe levels.  While transient 
reduction of Phe was apparent at doses of at least 0.1 mg/kg given once per week, this dose 
regimen was associated with a high incidence of systemic hypersensitivity reactions, typi[INVESTIGATOR_189421].  Further escalation above this dose of 
0.1 mg/kg/week would be required to sustain the effect on Phe levels over time.  Increased doses would require spreading dose administration over several days per week, as once- weekly ad ministration of higher doses would not be practical due to the large volume of 
study drug.  Therefore, additional dosing regimens would need to be explored in a subsequent study (PAL-004). 
Once subjects completed Study  PAL -002, they were eligible to enroll into this open- label 
extension study, PAL-003 to continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG up to a maximum dose of 
5.0 mg/kg/week or 375 mg/week.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -004 
PAL -004 (An Open- Label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
Subcutaneous Dose Level s of rAvPAL -PEG Administered Daily in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in April [ADDRESS_224546] enrolled into this study (PAL -003). One subject withdrew consent from 
continued participation prior to study completion. All subjects enrolled in this study were 
naïve to rAvPAL-PEG exposure. 
The objective of this study was to determine if daily administration (defined  as 5days/week) 
of rAvPAL -PEG at dose levels of 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day was safe and 
effective in reducing and maintaining blood Phe concentrations to 600 µmol/L in subjects 
with PKU. The starting dose was 0.4 mg/kg, administered 5 days/week. A total of 12 subjects were added in sequence and were started on doses of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06 mg, or 0.001/kg/day based on incoming safety data. Overall, subjects in PAL- 004 who initiated treatment at 
higher daily doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/day achi eved immediate and substantial reduction of 
blood Phe levels, but dosing had to be temporarily reduced or interrupted due to the onset of systemic hypersensitivity reactions at approximately Day [ADDRESS_224547] in the setting o f temporary dose reduction or interruption, but Phe levels generally 
improved if higher dose levels were reinstated.  
To prevent the onset of hypersensitivity reactions that were temporally associated with the 
onset of anti-drug IgM responses, an additiona l dosing strategy was assessed in PAL -004; - protocol.pdf Page 874
 PAL -003 A7 Page 31 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 4 subjects initiated dosing at a low dose of 0.001mg/kg/day or 0.06mg/kg/day for 
[ADDRESS_224548] the planned dose interruption, suggesting little advantage with this alternate induction regimen.  
Experience from PAL -004 indicated that initiating daily rAvPAL -PEG dosing with relatively 
high daily doses was not sustainable due to the onset of hypersensitivity reactions that occurred approximately 9 to 12 days after the start of administration, nor was the alternate dosing regimen (2 week drug holiday) well tolerated or effective in Phe reduction. In addition, the daily treatment regimen did not reduce the time to achieve target blood Phe levels seen in prev ious studies. This study indicated that to improve tolerability, 
rAvPAL -PEG should be initiated with an induction period at doses substantially lower than 
0.4mg/kg, followed by [CONTACT_189642].   
Once subjects completed Study  PAL -004, they were eligible to enroll into this open- label 
extension study to continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG up to a maximum dose of 
5.0 mg/kg/week or 375 mg/week.

Study 165-205 (A Phase 2, Multi- Center, Open -Label, Dose-Finding Study to Eva luate 
Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Subcutaneously Administered rAvPAL-PEG in Subjects 
With PKU for 24 Weeks) was initiated in May 2012. Data from ongoing Studies PAL-002, PAL -004, and PAL-003 suggested that a 4- week treatment course with weekly dosing at a 
fixed low dose (induction), followed by a weekly 2-fold, upward titration of rAvPAL- PEG to 
approximately 10-fold higher than the initiation dose (maximum of 375 mg/week) is effective and well tolerated. The objective of this study was to further assess this dosing 
regimen. Two rAvPAL-PEG dosing regimens were to be explored in this study:  weekly low-dose induction (2.5 mg/week for 4 to 8 weeks), followed by a period of upward dose titration towards a target Phe level (600 µmol/L) followed by [CONTACT_189664] 24 week study duration (Group 1).  The other dosing regimen planned for this study (Group 2) involved administration of a single bolus dose of [ADDRESS_224549] 3 weeks duration followed by [CONTACT_189665] a pattern similar to that employed in Group 1. A total of 24 subjects were enrolled into 165-205. In addition to confirming an effective, well- tolerated 
dose regimen, this study incorporated non- weight -based dosing, starting with dose - protocol.pdf Page 875

7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU i s an aut osomal, r ecessive, i nherited di sease characterized b y deficiency i n the enz yme 
PAH
. Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North America is born with PKU 
(Scriver, 2001, McGraw- Hill) . L eft unt reated,  PA H de ficiency i s associated w ith an 
abnormall
y elevated concentration of Phe, whic h is toxic to the brain ( Kaufman, 1989, J  
Pediatr.)  and can result in a varie ty of neuropathologic conditions, including mental 
retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities 
(Scriver, 2001, McGraw-H ill). The brains of untreated patients with PKU show evidence of 
hypomyelination a nd gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, and, in some cases, white matter 
degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated Phe during fe tal development 
leads  to severe mental r etardation  and c an cause microc ephaly , growth retardation, and 
congenit
al he art di sease (Guttler, 2003, P ediatrics ), ( Koch, 2003, P ediatrics ), (Lee, 2003, 
Pediatrics ), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics ), (Matalon, 2003, P ediatrics ), (Rouse, 2004, J .Pediatr.) . 
For a subset
 of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of PKU involves adherence to low- Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containing foods. Implementation of a 
Phe-restricted diet in infa ncy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents 
many of the neuropathologic manifestations of PKU, including severe mental retardation. However, compliance with this restrictive diet can be difficult for older children, adolescents, and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet ). 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with PKU safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. rAvPAL- PEG is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have additional clinical benefits.  
Blood Phe levels depend not only on the functional presence of the endogenous enzyme PAH 
but also on the dietary intake of Phe. It is important to understand the role of diet on blood Phe levels  concurrent with the administration of rAvPAL- PEG treatment. Therefore, an - protocol.pdf Page 876

this study unless per the Investigator. Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.     
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of 
rAvPAL -PEG in up to [ADDRESS_224551] already achieved Phe reduction to within the protocol- defined target range.  
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL-PEG Phase 2 studies. A dministration of 
rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess the long- term safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG 
in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from previous rAvPAL-PEG studies will change the assumption 
that rAv PAL -PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include injection -site reactions and other general symptoms.  
7.4.1 Toxicity Due to Exposure to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 
Acute exposure to high doses of PEG can result in renal toxicity. There have been a few reports of PEG -related AEs in humans; cumulative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, oliguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in widely used medicines and other compounds that are admini stered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189286] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG- related toxicity at the 
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kg rAvPAL -PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have 
been assocated with PEG -related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins 
(refer to Section  7.1).  - protocol.pdf Page 877
PAL -003 A7 Page 34 
Proprietary and Confidential Amendment 7: [ADDRESS_224552] partially inaccessible by [CONTACT_189666] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab ). In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that 
PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the immunological respons e (Scott, 1997, 
Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs. ). PEGylation has been effective in 
reducing anti -rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model but does not eliminate antibody 
formation. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL likely reduces the antigenicity of the molecule, 100% of individuals exposed to rAvPAL-PEG develop antibodies against rAvPAL.  
Drug -specific immune responses can r ange from  clinical i rrelevance to c ausing  serious  
hypersensitivity AEs (such as anaphylaxis) and may reduce efficacy due to 
antibody- mediated dr ug clearance or ant ibody ne utralization  of enzymatic act ivity.  
Histori
cally, PEG was thought to be nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.), 
(Harris, 2003, N at.Rev.Drug Discov.) ; however, repeated studies have found that 
subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous exposure to 
PEG can induce anti-PEG antibodies 
(Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), (Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.). In 
some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in significant clinical effects in 
humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . However, PEG antibody responses 
were associated w ith hypersensitivity r eactions  to  PEGylated lipos omes (J udge, 2006, 
Mol.Ther.) . Anti-PEG antibodies have also bee n associated with nonresponsi veness against 
therapy (Armstrong, 2007, C ancer ), (Ganson, 2006, A rthritis Res.Ther.) . 
Subjects pa
rticipating in the Phase [ADDRESS_224553] been monitored closely for 
anti-drug immunogenicity (anti-rAvPAL immunoglobulin G [IgG], anti- rAvPAL IgM, 
anti-PEG IgM, anti -PEG IgG, neutralizing antibodies that inhibit PAL enzymatic activity, 
anti-rAvPAL IgE, and anti -rAvPAL -PEG IgE), complements, C -reactive protein (CRP), 
ESR, and complete chemistry. All subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in the Phase [ADDRESS_224554] 
detected within 2 -3 weeks of treatment initiation and anti- rAvPAL IgG antibodies were 
detected within 2 -3 months. The anti-rAvPAL IgG response generally peaked by 3-5 months 
and was sustained in all subjects. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) capable of inhibiting enzymatic activity were detected in a minority of subjects 2 -3 months after treatment 
initiation. The timing of the NAb response suggests these antibodies may be a component of - protocol.pdf Page 878
 PAL -003 A7 Page 35 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 the anti -rAvPAL IgG response. It is expected that the centralized location of the PAL active 
site, within the tetrameric structure, makes it difficult for antibodies to bind and inhibit 
enzymatic activity. In addition, anti-PAL antibody binding is likely sterically hindered by [CONTACT_189683]. The majority of treated subjects also developed a transient anti- PEG 
antibody response. The anti- PEG response was comprised of IgM and IgG isotypes. In 
general, anti -PEG antibodies were no longer detected after 5 -6 months of treatment. This 
type of transient antibody response is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] T cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) responses. 
The majority of immune -mediated AEs experienced in subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in 
the Phase [ADDRESS_224555] and can lead to the accumulation of complement component 
anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a) that can induce hypersensitivity symptoms. Although IgG immune complexes can also activate the classical complement pathway, they do so with less effici ency than IgM. This is due, in part, to the requirement for multiple Fc regions in close 
proximity to activate the complement cascade, meaning that multiple monomeric IgG Abs are required to bind, whereas only one pentameric IgM Ab is needed to bind to act ivate 
complement. Also, in the case of rAvPAL-PEG, binding of anti-PAL IgG antibodies is likely compromised due to epi[INVESTIGATOR_189400], which may reduce IgG- mediated 
complement activation in vivo . This complex dynamic between combined isotype- specific 
Ab responses and epi[INVESTIGATOR_189401] a major factor dictating the need for an induction and titration dose regimen in the treatment of rAvPAL- PEG to be implemented 
in this study.

week upon return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.  Subjects who qualify for self-administration of study drug are trained to recognize a serious hypersensitivity AEs and how to respond. Additionally, subjects are given two epi[INVESTIGATOR_189402] (Section 9.4). Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
for instructions regarding resumption of study drug following resolution of symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis per National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylax is Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria 
(Sampson, 2006, J.Allergy Clin.Immunol. ).  
In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, subjects may be asked to see an allergist/immunologist and/or provide up to [ADDRESS_224558] ement testing. This additional testing may occur up to 6  months following 
the final study visit.  
The following measures are recommended for the treatment of hypersensitivity reaction symptoms: 
• Maintain the airway.  
• Vital sign check.  
• Administration of oral or IV diphenhydramine. 
• Administration of epi[INVESTIGATOR_189288]. 
• Administration of oral or IV glucocorticoids. 
• Administration of oxygen and IV fluids. 
• Administration of additional symptomatic treatment.  
• Transfer to an acute care facility of the study center.  
In addition, clinical judgment must be used in determining the appropriateness of corticosteroid administration. An allergy and/or immunology consultation should be sought if necessary. Detailed instructions for the management of hypersensitivity r eactions are

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with 
PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 
studies (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided 
no dose- limiting toxicity was observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG studies. Subjects’ doses 
will not exceed 375 mg/week. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL-PEG study will be enrolled into this study. 
Subjects enrolling into PAL-[ADDRESS_224559] their starting dose determined per the sponsor’s 
medical monitor.  The first week of dosing will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for 30 minutes following administration. Subjects are given two epi[INVESTIGATOR_189422] (refer to Section  9.4). A  follow- up telephone call will be made to the subject to monitor 
subject safety [ADDRESS_224560] diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be brought to clinic monthly for review with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189668]’s medical monitor and if adequate training is de monstrated. Subjects must meet a set 
of criteria to be considered appropriate for self- administration. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_224561] is introduced, every 24 weeks, and more often as needed. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured 
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE), version 4. - protocol.pdf Page 882
 PAL -003 A7 Page 39 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) w ill monitor the safety of 
subjects in the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long-term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’previous rAvPAL-PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL-003. 
In PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to attain or maintain 
blood Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a 
subject’s weight or w ill be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.  
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 9.1.[ADDRESS_224562]’s blood Phe concentration has been 
controlled to within a target range (60 -600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have 
additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per the discreti on of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor. 
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 98 visit. 
• The study is terminated.  
• The study drug receives marketing authorization. 
Because the risks of taking rAvPAL-PEG during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown, 
subjects cannot take rAvPAL -PEG if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are 
breastfeeding ( refer to Section  9.3.2, Exclusion Criteria ). Male subjects who are planning to 
impregnate a female partner and female subjects who are trying to become pregnant during 
the study will be discontinued immediately from study drug. Male subjects who have impregnated a female partner may re -start study drug after conception but must return to the 
study-required contraception use ( refer to Section  9.3.1, Inclusion Criteria ), which must 
include one barrier method. Subjects who remain in the study after discontinuation of study drug due to pregnancy may re-introduce rAvPAL-PEG dosing after the birth has been reported (or termination of the pregnancy) and breastfeeding has completed (if applicable) or after the subject is no longer actively trying to conceive. Re- starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing 
must be per investigator and sponsor agreement based on an assessment of the known risks and potential benefits while taking BMN 165. Female subjects must return to the - protocol.pdf Page 883

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 study-required contraception use ( refer to Section  9.3.1), which must include one barrier 
method, immediately after the birth (or termination of the pregnancy).   
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accurac y, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made 
to retain subjects in the study and to have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety.  
A PK substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in up to 
[ADDRESS_224563] additional pre-dose PK sampling performed (refer to Table 9.1.2).

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 9.1.1 Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout the study and are trained to recognize potential 
hypersensitivity AEs (including anaphylaxis) and how to respond. Subjects are instructed to contact [CONTACT_189660]. The investigator may require further evaluation at the clinic. If a hypersensitivity AE (eg, injection -site reaction, rash, joint 
pain, itching) occurs, the subject may be advised to premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) approximately 
2-3 hours prior to subsequent rAvPAL-PEG doses. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.  
Hypersensitivity AEs, includin g anaphylaxis, are expected with rAvPAL -PEG

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 [IP_ADDRESS] Response to Anaphylaxis 
If the investigator suspects that the event is anaphylaxis, the subject will be assessed in the 
clinic. Laboratory assessments for suspected anaphylaxis events should be performed prior to the next administration of study drug (if applicable) and include anti-rAvPAL IgE and anti-rAvPAL -PEG IgE (sampling must be performed >8 hours after event onset and before 
the next dose of study drug) and tryptase (within 24 hours of event onset). The investigator will consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from study drug, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level. 
For the firs t week of dosing after resolution of anaphylaxis, the study drug will be 
administered in a clinic setting with equipment for emergency resuscitation (including 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within easy access.  The subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224578], and NSAIDs approximately 2-3 hours prior to each dose of study drug for one week upon return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. NSAIDs should be given with food and may be omitted if not tolerated.

9.1.3 Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology  
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions 
regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations. 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224580]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mg/kg or 
2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375 mg/week) or per Investigator determination 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events for an individual subject.
 Dose increases  > 350 mg/week 
require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg or 375 mg/week. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224581] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. - protocol.pdf Page 892
 PAL -003 A7 Page 49 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology  
Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available information regarding a 
subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse event (any hypersensitivity reaction as defined in Section  9.1.1). Dose decreases may occur for hypophenylalanemia or 
any adverse event that may be improved with a lower dose.  
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg or 375, 300, 225, 150, 75, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/week). It is also permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are required in response to safety, dosing frequency may also be adjusted.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L ), the 
subject’s rAvPAL-PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224582] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease mana gement, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician).

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g.,  sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study -drug or 
other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577].  
• Complications th at occur as a result of non -drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused  the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study-drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
The study AE reporting period is as follows:  After informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study drug, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported.  
After informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug, all non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until [ADDRESS_224615] administration of study drug or the Study Completion Visit/Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs last  (refer to Section 12). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of 
SAEs is provided in Section 10.2.  
For this study, a medical device is defined as the prefilled syringe and all of the component 
parts. The reporting period for device- related events begins with the first dose administered 
using prefilled syringe and ends with the last dose administered using prefilled syringe. Events assessed by [CONTACT_189674], including malf unction, injury, or 
medication error, will be captured into an electronic data capture system. All serious events related to the device will be reported to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV) within 24 hours using the device- related event report form and entered onto the appropriate eCRF page(s) as 
required.  - protocol.pdf Page 912
 PAL -003 A7 Page 69 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: [ADDRESS_224616] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Outcome of AEs (and resolution dates) should be documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record unless the subject is lost to follow -up or it has been determined that the study drug or study 
participation  is not the cause of the AE. 
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AEs for severity, relationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see  Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to 
seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigator will determine the severity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe  or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening : 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self care activities of daily living (ADL)b 
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using 
the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the 
toilet, tak ing medications, not bedridden.  - protocol.pdf Page 913
 PAL -003 A7 Page 70 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: [ADDRESS_224617] it 
on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related 
in time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the IP; 
that is, there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to 
the IP.  
Possibly 
Related  The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time 
AND 
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189684].  
Probably 
Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND 
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189685].  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189580], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology).  
 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life threatening.  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at immediate 
risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused  death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy. - protocol.pdf Page 914
 PAL -003 A7 Page 71 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 • Importa nt medical events or reactions that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189426].  
For this protocol, anaphylaxis per NIAID/FAAN criteria for the clinical diagnosis of 
anaphylaxis is designated as an AE of special interest (serious or nonserious and irrespective of severity) to facilitate rapid reporting and sponsor review. All occurr ences of anaphylaxis 
per NIAID/FAAN criteria will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event using the SAE form. Severity and serious criteria (if applicable) should be reported on the SAE form. 
The reporting period for SAEs related to protocol imposed interventions begins after 
informed consent is obtained, the reporting period for all SAEs begins after first dose of study drug and continues until [ADDRESS_224618] administered dose. 
All SAEs (including serious device-related events), whether or not considered related to 
study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event by 
[CONTACT_189581]-specific SAE Report Form or device Report Form to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). Each SAE must also be reported in the CRF Investigators should not wait to collect inf ormation that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a 
SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189463].  The 
Investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug or parti cipation is 
not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented in the CRF and in the subject’s medical record. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report). 
At the last scheduled visit, the Investigator should instruct each subject to report any 
subsequent SAEs t hat the subject’s personal physician(s) believes might be related to prior 
study drug. 
The Investigator should notify the study Sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation if felt to be related to prior - protocol.pdf Page 915

Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measure s taken and shall ensure that the 
IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for these events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours. - protocol.pdf Page 916
 PAL -003 A7 Page 73 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of t he 
following: 
• Immediate need to revise the IP administration (i.e., modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol). 
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management. 
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements.

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no for mal statistical tests will be performed. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency and percent, while continuous data will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical analysis.  
14.[ADDRESS_224634] postdose safety information will be included in the safety analyses.  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology (MedDRA) will be used by [CONTACT_189686] (CRF).  
The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. A by–subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a serious AE (SAE), including death, or experie nce an AE associated with early 
withdrawal from the study or study drug. Hypersensitivity AEs and AEs that result in dosing interruption or dose level reduction are of interest, and the percentage of subjects who report these AEs will be presented.  
Clinica l laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. Frequency and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference range) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented  for each 
clinical laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post- treatment visits. Changes from baseline to the 
post- treatment visits will also be provided. Descriptive statistics of vital signs, physical 
examination results, ECG results, and X- ray results, and immunogenicity test results will also 
be provided. Additionally, antibodies and titers will be summarized by [CONTACT_51256].

accumulation should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added for PK analysis 
as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s me dical 
monitor. 
14.3.[ADDRESS_224636]- treatment efficacy data will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point will be summarized using descr iptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration from baseline (to be defined in the SAP) to each scheduled time point and presence/absence of antibodies will also be summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe concentrations of 60 -600 µmol/L will be summarized by [CONTACT_189594]. 
The relationship of dietary Phe intake (per information reported on the subject diet diary) and 
blood Phe concentration will also be explored. Subjects who received any amount of study drug with any post-treatment blood Phe concentration measurements and diet diary information will be included in this exploratory analysis.  
Details regarding exploratory analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
14.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Subjects who participated in previous rAvPAL-PEG studies may be enrolled into this study. 
No formal sample size calculation was conducted for this study or the PAL-003 Substudy.   
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
All analyses will be presented based on observed data only. Missing data will not be imputed 
for analyses unless sensitivity analyses are warranted. If imputations are used, detailed imputation methods will be described in the SAP before locking the data base.  - protocol.pdf Page 926

The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre- specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for study -related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment, unless the executed Clinical Trial Agreement between BioMarin and the institution of the investigator specifies otherwise. If the subject 
has followed the Investigator’s instructions, BioMarin may pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531]. In some jurisdictio ns, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]-related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.  - protocol.pdf Page 929
 PAL -003 A7 Page 86 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: [ADDRESS_224640] be completed using a web–based application that has been validated. Study site personnel will be trained on the applica tion and will enter the clinical data from source 
documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will corre ct the value by [CONTACT_189475]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the site personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction, and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all ori ginal recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized repres entative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent.  
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189630] “source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated fi eld. Site 
personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, all data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Investigator will then electronically sign the casebook, specifying that the information on the CRFs is accurate and complete. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. Upon completion of the clinical study report for the entire study, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents. - protocol.pdf Page 930

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 7: 16 December 2015 24 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT TEXT REVISIONS  
The following is a summary of significant protocol revisions; added text is underlined and deleted text is struck . The study design schematic 
(Figure 9.1.1) and Schedule of Events (Table 9.1.1) were revised accordingly. Addi tional administrative changes have been made for 
consistency and clarity throughout this amendment and are reflected in the protocol body. Revisions made to the Synopsis (Section 2) are 
reflected in the corresponding protocol section as appropriate. Revisions to cross references to protocol tables, figures, sections, and references reside within the protocol body.  
Section  Revision  Rationale for 
Change  
Section 2, Section 9.1, 
Study Design  Because the risks of taking rAvPAL -PEG during pregnancy and breastfe eding are unknown, subjects cannot 
take rAvPAL -PEG if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Male subjects who are 
planning to impregnate a female partner and female subjects who are trying to become pregnant during the 
study will be discontinued immediately from study drug. Male subjects who have impregnated a female 
partner may re -start study drug after conception but must return  to the study-required contraception use, 
which must include one barrier method. Subjects who remain in the study after discontinuation of study drug 
due to pregnancy may re- introduce rAvPAL -PEG dosing after the birth has been reported (or termination of 
the pregnancy) and breastfeeding has completed (if applicable) or after the subject is no longer acti vely 
trying to conceive. Re -starting rAvPAL -PEG dosing must be per investigator and sponsor agreement based 
on an assessment of the known risks and potential benefits while taking BMN 165. Female subjects must 
return to the study-required contraception use , which must include one barrier method, immediately after the 
birth (or termination of the pregnancy).  [ADDRESS_224656] meet all of the following criteria:  
• Sexually active subjects must be willing to use an two acceptable methods of contraception while 
participating in the study.  Males post vasectomy for 2 years with no known pregnancies do not need 
to use any other forms of contraception during the study. 3

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  SUMMARY  
Amendment:  8 
Date: [ADDRESS_224667] of all significant changes and supporting rationale:  
1. To monitor subject safety, a repeat urinalysis should be performed for subjects who 
have an abnormal or elevated proteinuria test result. Additionally, first or second morning void is being recommended for all urinalyses collected during the study. In 
addition, information regarding renal toxicity due to exposure to PEG has been updated in the background section ( Section 7.4.1). 
2. Additional instruction has been added for subjects who are pregnant or are planning 
to become pregnant (or impregnate a female partner) during the study for clarity and to monitor subject safety.  
o Subjects who are planning to conceive must stop study drug at least [ADDRESS_224668] use two forms of acceptable 
contraception prior to trying to conceive. 
o Subjects who are planning to become pregnant ( or impregnate a female 
partner) during the study may modify their diet in consultation with the 
investigator and/or study dietician .  
o Subjects who are pregnant or are trying to conceive and have temporarily discontinued study drug are not required to perform the scheduled pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments.  
o Subjects who have been confirmed to be pregnant with a serum pregnancy test are not required to perform the urine pregnancy tests while pregnant. 
o Upon re-starting study drug following a pregnancy or breastfeeding , 
female subjects must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test result.  
3. Additional instruction regarding adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) reporting has been added to provide clarity and to improve the quality of safety reporting. The following have been added: 
o Guidance on factors suggestive of a causal relationship to study drug to facilitate investigator assessments of AEs  
o Guidance on how to report AEs occurring secondary to other events  
o Guidance on reporting of persistent versus recurrent AEs  - protocol.pdf Page 943
 PAL -003 A8 Page 3 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224669] an elevated urine/albumin creatinine ratio (defined as confirmed result of ≥
  100 mg/g for subjects with results within 
normal r ange at baseline or a confirmed increase of 100-200 mg/g from baseline for 
subjects with elevated results at baseline) should be referred to a nephrologist for consultation. 
5. To monitor for subject safety, subjects who experience an injection- site skin reaction 
that lasts 
 ≥ 14 days should be referred for a dermatology consultation and may be 
asked to perform a skin biopsy. 
6. Instruction regarding the premedications to administer prior to injection of study drug has been revised to provide alternative medications to subjects w ho may not tolerate 
non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS); subjects may alternatively be 
premedicated with antipyretics  (eg, acetaminophen) . 
7. Information regarding exploratory sample analysis (use of leftover blood and urine samples) during the stu dy and after the subject completes the study has been added.  
8. The Schedule of Events has been modified; scheduled visits are to occur every 8 weeks (rather than every 4 weeks and quarterly) to align with the visit schedule in the ongoing extension (Part 4) of the Phase [ADDRESS_224670] more recent information and/or instruction regarding study

TITLE OF STUDY : 
Long-term Extension of a Phase 2, Open -Label Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, 
and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL -PEG in Subjects with PKU  
PROTOCOL NUMBER :  PAL -003 
STUDY SITES :  Approximately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002]  
PHASE  OF DEVELOPMENT :  Phase 2  
STUDY RATIONALE : 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) safely achieve lifelong, reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. PEGylat ed recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) 
is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may hav e 
additional clinical benefits. This study is an extension of the rAvPAL -PEG Phase [ADDRESS_224673] diet are not allowed in this study unless per the Investigator. Diet  will be 
monitored using a diet diary.  
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in 
up to [ADDRESS_224674] already achieved Phe reduction to within 
the protocol-defined target range.  This substudy has been completed as of 20 December 2013. - protocol.pdf Page 946

OBJECTIVES : 
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the effect of long -term a dministration of multiple doses of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations in subjects with PKU. 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long- term administration of subcutaneous (SC) 
injections of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
• To evaluate the immune response to long- term administration of SC injections of 
rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The exploratory objective of the study is as follows:  
• To evaluate the long -term relationship of diet and change in blood Phe concentration 
following administration with rAvPAL- PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The Substudy objectives are as follows: 
• To evaluate steady -state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who have achieved and maintained 
target blood Phe concentration and for whom no further dose modifications are planned.  
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
This is a long -term extension of rAvPAL-PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with PKU. The 
doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 studies (starting at 
0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided no dose- limiting toxicity is 
observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG study. Subjects’ doses will not exceed 375 mg/week. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL -PEG study will be enrolled into this study. Subjects 
enrolling into PAL -[ADDRESS_224676] their 
starting dose determined per the sponsor’s medical monitor. The first dose will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224677] safety 24  hours following the return to dosing.  - protocol.pdf Page 947

Diet should not be altered during the course of this study.  Any decision to modify subject diet must be 
made per the Investigator and must be performed under the supervision of the Investigator. To monitor for changes in subject diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for completion and will be reviewed 
with the clinical study staff on a monthly basis.  
Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189659]’s 
medical monitor and if ade quate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be 
considered appropriate for self-administration.  Additional training will be provided to subjects and 
demonstration of competency required when prefilled syringe drug product is int roduced, every 
24 weeks, and more often as needed.  
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version  4. 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of subjects in 
the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of su bjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’ previous rAvPAL-PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL- 003. In 
PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to attain or maintain blood Phe 
concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rA vPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a subject’s weight or will 
be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis. 
Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points. After the subject’s 
blood Phe concentration has been controlled to within a target range (60-600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per 
the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
A subject will continue in PAL-003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  
•  The subject has com pleted the study through the Week 476 visit.   
•  The study is terminated.  
• The study drug receives marketing authorization.  - protocol.pdf Page 948

Because the risks of taking BMN 165 during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown, subjects 
cannot take BMN 165 if they are trying to  conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding (refer to 
Section  9.3.2 for Exclusion Criteria). Male subjects who are planning to impregnate a female partner 
and female subjects who are trying to become pregnant during the study  must be temporarily 
discontinued from study drug for [ADDRESS_224680] 
use two acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who are planning to become pregnant (or 
impregnate a female partner) may modify  their diet in consultation with the investigator and/or study 
dietician. Subjects who are confirmed to be pregnant per a serum pregnancy test and are temporarily 
off study drug are not required to perform the scheduled urine pregnancy tests. Subjects who are 
pregnant or are trying to conceive and have temporarily discontinued study drug should not perform 
the scheduled PK assessments. Male subjects who have impregnated a female partner may re- start 
study drug after conception following the investigator’s c onsultation with and approval by [CONTACT_35011]. Male subjects must return to the study-required contraception use, which must include one barrier method, prior to restarting study drug. F emale subjects who remain in the study after temporary 
discontinuation of study drug due to pregnancy may restart BMN [ADDRESS_224681] result, the birth has been reported (or termination of the pregnancy), and 
breastfeeding has completed (if applicable) or after the subject is no longer actively trying to conceive. Re-starting BMN 165 dosing requires the investigator’s prior consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_35041]. Female subjects must return to the study -required contraception use, which must 
include one barrier method, immediately after the birth (or termination of the pregnancy).  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will be asked to 
continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from 
study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to 
have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety.

Dose Modificat ions: 
Dose Increase Methodology : 
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions regarding 
dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrations.  
An individual subjec t’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224684]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile 
and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as foll ows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10- fold higher than the subject’s 
current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4,0, and 5.0 mg/kg or 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 
40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375 mg/week) or per Investigator determination based on available 
information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction)  for an individual subject. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week 
require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly dose not 
to exceed 5.0 mg/kg or 375 mg/week.  Dose increa ses  > 350 mg/week require consultation 
with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224685] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be 
observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the 
overall weekly dose amount.  
• Only [ADDRESS_224686]’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse events (any hypersensitivity reaction). Dose decreases 
may occur for hypophenylalanemia or any adverse event that may be improved with a lower dose.  - protocol.pdf Page 950

permitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If further dosing adjustments are 
required in response to safety, dosing frequency may also be adjusted. 
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L), the s ubject’s 
rAvPAL -PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose. If the condition persists after another 
[ADDRESS_224688] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and 
nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should 
be monitored by a dietician). 
Safety Assessment Criteria : 
Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout the study and are trained to recognize potential hypersensitivity AEs (including anaphylaxis) and how to respond. Subjects are instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_189660]. The investigator may require further evaluation at the clinic. If a hypersensitivity AE (eg, injection -site reaction, rash, joint pain, itc hing) occurs, the 
subject may be advised to premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and antipyretics 
(eg, acetaminophen) approximately 2 -3 hours prior to subsequent rAvPAL -PEG doses. If non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) is administ ered as a premedication, it should be given with 
food.  
Hypersensitivity AEs, including anaphylaxis, are expected with rAvPAL -PEG administration. 
rAvPAL -PEG  dosing in response to a suspected hypersensitivity AE may be modified or halted 
depending on the se verity of the event and suspected rAvPAL -PEG causality. Severity for 
hypersensitivity AEs will be per NCI -CTCAE gr ades. 
Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189403]  ≥ 3 hypersensitivity AE that is related to study drug and is 
suspected to meet Brown’s criteria for severe (grade 3) in the judgment of the investigator and the 
sponsor’s medical monitor may be permanently discontinued from study drug.  - protocol.pdf Page 951
 PAL -003 A8 Page 11 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
Dosing in Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Dosing in response to a hypersensitivity AE depends on the NCI- CTCAE grade and suspected 
relationship to rAvPAL -PEG .  
Once an AE (other than anaphylaxis) improves to grade 1 or resolves, study drug dose may be 
increased, maintained, or reduced. If dosing has been interrupted due to an AE (other than 
anaphylaxis) and the investigator determines it is safe for the subject to resume dosing, the first dose 
after improvement of the AE should be performed in the clinic. The subject must be observed for 
[ADDRESS_224689], and antipyretics  (eg, acetaminophen) approximately 
2-[ADDRESS_224690] will be assessed in the clinic. 
Laboratory assessments for suspected anaphylaxis events should be performed prior to the next 
administration of study drug (if applicable) and include anti-rAvPAL IgE and anti- rAvPAL -PEG IgE 
(sampling must be performed >8 hours after event onset and before the next dose of study drug) and 
tryptase (within 24  hours of event onset). The investigator will consult with the sponsor’s medical 
monitor, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from study drug, restart 
dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing at a lower dose level.  
For the first week of dosing after resolution of anaphylaxis, the study drug will be administered in a 
clinic setting with equipment for emergency resuscitation  (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within easy access.  
The subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224691], and antipyretics  
(eg, acetaminophen) approximately 2 -3 hours prior to each dose of study drug for one week upon 
return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. If  NSAIDs  are administered as a 
premedication, they should be given with food.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] : 
If an NCI -CTCAE grade  ≥ 3 hypersensitivity treatment -related event occurs and meets Brown’s 
criteria for severe (grade 3), an ad hoc independent DMC meeting will convene within [ADDRESS_224692]. Clinically severe 
hypersensitivity is d efined as significant hypoxia, hypotension or neurologic compromise that is 
life-threatening or required treatment to prevent a life- threatening event:

7 INTRODUCTION 
A comprehensive review of PEGylated recombinant Anabaena variabilis phenylalanine 
ammonia lyase (rAvPAL -PEG) is contained in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_189447]; the Investigator 
should review this document prior to initiating this study.  
7.1 Nonclinical Studies  
The nonclinical program for rAvPAL- PEG has characterized the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology of rAvPAL-PEG using the intended clinical SC route 
of administration. Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of 
PKU. The ENU2 mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, 
including hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 µ M) 
and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. Following weekly doses of rAvPAL- PEG administered to male 
ENU2 mice, plasma Phe concentrations decreased from approximately 2000  µM to 
< 200 µM after 2 dose administrations. An attenuated reduction of blood Phe was seen 
between Week  3 and Week 7 of dosing. After 7 weekly administrations of rAvPAL- PEG, 
pharmacological activity returned as evidenced by [CONTACT_189563] < 200 µM over the entire week, which continued for a total of 15 we eks. 
In pharmacodynamic studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model administered 
80 mg/kg/week rAvPEG -PAL, two dose interruption assessments were performed: 
a 2-4 week dose interruption and an 11-week dose interruption. Following both dose interruption assessments, the animals re- started rAvPAL -PEG at a dose of 80 mg/kg/week. 
No attenuated Phe response was observed when rAvPAL- PEG injections were temporarily 
stopped for 2-4 weeks, and there was an immediate return to stable blood Phe reductions. A simila r interim attenuated response was observed with the longer dose interruption of 
approximately 11 weeks. In both of these assessments, no safety issues were noted upon 
re-starting dosing with rAvPAL -PEG  (Lapis, 2007, ASHG 57th Annual Meeting). 
Safety pharma cology studies were conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. No 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_189343] (CNS) effects were seen with SC administration of rAvPAL -PEG. No changes in cardiovascular (CV) parameters, including electrocardiogram 
(ECG) waveforms, were observed in telemetry -instrumented monkeys assessed for the CV 
effects of rAvPAL -PEG administered subcutaneously. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in single-dose and repeat-dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The elimination half -life (t
1/2) values of rAvPAL- PEG administered to 
normal rats at SC doses of 10, 25, and 250 mg/kg were 47, 33, and 44 hours, respectively, - protocol.pdf Page 968
 PAL -003 A8 Page 28 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224718] area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC) -dose. In the 
cynomolgus monkey after SC administration of rAvPAL-PEG, the t 1/2 was 65  hours at 
4.0 mg/kg, 71  hours at 12 mg/kg, and could not be determined at 60 mg/kg (the highest 
dose). Qualitatively, the kinetics of rAvPAL-PEG in the rat and monkey appear to have 
similar characteristics. The follow ing findings were noted: (1) a 1-compartment model with 
first-order absorption appears to describe the plasma profiles of rAvPAL- PEG after 
single -dose administration, (2) absorption is slow and there is a long absorption period after 
SC administration to maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), along with a long t 1/2, 
(3) elimination is slow and monophasic, (4) there does not appear to be a gender difference, and (5) the AUC and the C
max are roughly linearly proportional.  
Toxicology of rAvPAL- PEG was assessed in single -dose and repeat-dose studies in normal 
rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In the single-dose rat study, decreased body weight gain and Kupffer cell vacuolization at the high SC dose of 250 mg/kg was observed; however, the Kupffer cell finding was not seen in the single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. In a 
26-week repeat -dose toxicity and toxicokinetic (TK) rat study, decreased body weight gain, 
decreased food consumption, vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule cells, and vacuolation of t he histiocytic cells were observed in rats administered 25 mg/kg/dose, twice 
weekly. In a 39 -week repeat -dose study in monkeys, arterial inflammation, perivascular 
cellular infiltrates in the SC injection sites, thymic atrophy, and increased lymphoid nodul es 
in bone marrow of the sternum were observed in monkeys given ≥ 3 mg/kg/dose, twice weekly. Of these findings, only the arterial inflammation was deemed adverse and this finding was completely reversed after [ADDRESS_224719] -level (NOAEL) of rAvPAL -PEG when administered 
subcutaneously twice weekly for 26 weeks and 39 weeks in the rat and monkey, respectively, was 1.0 mg/kg. These NOAELs were based on histological findings of vacuolation/hypertrophy of the renal tubule c ells in the rat and arterial inflammation findings 
in the monkey. 
7.2 Previous Clinical Studies  
The rAvPAL-PEG clinical development program has been designed to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG  in reducing blood Phe concentrations in PKU subje cts 
who do not respond to treatment with Kuvan
® or are not compliant with Kuvan® treatment.  
This study is an extension of the ongoing human clinical studies with rAvPAL- PEG 
(Study  PAL -002, Study PAL-004, and Study 165-205) based on data from the completed 
clinical study, PAL -001, and clinical experience from this ongoing study and the other 
ongoing Phase 2 studies, PAL-002 and PAL-004.  - protocol.pdf Page 969
 PAL -003 A8 Page 29 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224720] of rAvPAL -PEG on blood Phe concentrations. 
The effectiveness of rAvPAL -PEG in decreasing Phe concentrations in nonclinical studies of 
ENU2 mice was consistent with what was observed in PAL-001. PAL- 001 enrolle d 25 PKU 
subjects with a mean (standard deviation; SD) baseline blood Phe concentration of 
1310 µmol/L (405). The 25 subjects who enrolled into the study were assigned to receive a single administration of rAvPAL -PEG at 1 of 5 dose levels: 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, and 
0.1 mg/kg. Five subjects each received 1  of the 5 dose levels of rAvPAL- PEG.  
Key safety, efficacy, and PK results of Study PAL -001 are summarized as follows: 
• rAvPAL -PEG was well tolerated and had a clinically significant blood -lowering 
effect  on Phe concentration when administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg.  
• For the 5 subjects who were administered 0.1 mg/kg rAvPAL- PEG, clinically 
significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed, with the most clinically 
significant decreases from baseline values to Day 7, ranging from 33.8% to 97.3% 
(mean of 58.12%). The mean baseline blood Phe level for these 5 subjects was 1113 µmol/L.  
• Overall, no clinically significant reductions in blood Phe level were observed in 
subjects who were administered rAvPAL -PEG at the lower doses of 0.001, 0.003, 
0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg. 
• For subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG at the 3  higher dose levels 
(0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg) and who had measurable rAvPAL- PEG concentration 
levels, the calculated PK parameters were a m ean T
max of 89-106 hours, a t 1/[ADDRESS_224721] been designed 
to evaluate rAvPAL -PEG at various doses and dosing regimens to safely achieve and 
maintain blood Phe reductions in subjects with PKU. Currently, there are three ongoing Phase 2 studies (PAL-002, PAL-004, 165-205); an overview of each study is presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -002), Section [IP_ADDRESS] (PAL -004), and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (165-205).  - protocol.pdf Page 970

[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -002 
Study PAL -002 (A Phase 2, Open- Label, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Efficacy, and Tolerability of Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of rAvPAL- PEG in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in September [ADDRESS_224722] completed the study. PAL -002 enrolled 11 previously exposed subjects from the single-dose study, PAL- 001, and 
29 subjects who were naïve to rAvPAL- PEG. Thirty -three of  the 37 subjects who completed 
PAL -002 enrolled into this open-label extension study (PAL-003). Two subjects 
discontinued from the study due to lost to follow-up, relocation, or other reasons, and [ADDRESS_224723] discontinued from the study due to an AE (skin reaction).  
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of 
rAvPAL -PEG (ranging from 0.001 mg/kg/week to 1.0 mg/kg/week) on blood Phe 
concentrations in subjects with PKU with up to 16 weeks of treatment. The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of 
multiple doses of rAvPAL-PEG, to evaluate the immune response to rAvPAL-PEG, and to evaluate the PK profile of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects with PKU.  
The PAL -002 study design consists of two parts. In Part 1, rAvPAL- PEG was administered 
as a once weekly fixed, low -dose induction regimen for 8 weeks. In Part 2, the rAvPAL- PEG 
dose was titrated upwards; subjects received adjustable dose increases for up to 8  weeks to 
achieve a tar get blood Phe concentration of 600 µmol/L. The doses and dosing schedules 
were revised with a series of protocol amendments to incorporate the information gained during conduct of this early, open- label, multiple -dose study.  
A wide range of doses was plan ned for the PAL-002 study, beginning with doses as low as 
0.001mg/kg/week.  However, no substantial reductions in blood Phe level were observed in the majority of subjects who were administered rAvPAL- PEG in the initial four cohorts at 
doses of 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, and 0.03 mg/kg administered once per week. The absence of appreciable Phe reduction after 16 weeks of treatment in this range of doses led to a decision to amend the study protocol to include a cohort with a higher starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg/week,  which had been previously shown to decrease blood Phe levels to 
approximately 600 µmol/L in the single -dose, Phase 1 study (PAL-001). After the first 
2 weeks of dosing at 0.1 mg/kg/week, transient Phe reduction was observed in this subset of subjects. However, this dosing regimen was accompanied by [CONTACT_189682], suggesting that additional exploration of dosing regimens would be required.  - protocol.pdf Page 971
 PAL -003 A8 Page 31 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
In summary, preliminary results from PAL -002 demonstrated that doses below 0.1 g/kg 
administered once per week were not effective in reducing Phe levels.  While transient 
reduction of Phe was apparent at doses of at least 0.1 mg/kg given once per week, this dose regimen was associated with a high inciden ce of systemic hypersensitivity reactions, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_189399].  Further escalation above this dose of 0.1 mg/kg/week would be required to sustain the effect on Phe levels over time.  Increased doses would require spreading dose administration over several days per week, as once-weekly administration of higher doses would not be practical due to the large volume of study drug.  Therefore, additional dosing regimens would need to be explored in a subsequent study (PAL-004). 
Once subjects completed Study  PAL -002, they were eligible to enroll into this open- label 
extension study, PAL-003 to continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG up to a maximum dose of 
5.0 mg/kg/week or 375 mg/week.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAL -004 
PAL -004 (An Open- Label Study to Evaluate the Safet y, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
Subcutaneous Dose Levels of rAvPAL- PEG Administered Daily in Subjects With 
Phenylketonuria) was initiated in April [ADDRESS_224724] enrolled into this study (PAL -003). One subject withdrew consent from 
continued participation prior to study completion. All subjects enrolled in this study were 
naïve to rAvPAL-PEG exposure. 
The objective of this study was to determine if daily administration (defined as 5days/week) 
of rAvPAL -PEG at dose levels of 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg/day was safe and 
effective in reducing and maintaining blood Phe concentrations to 600 µmol/L in subjects with P KU. The starting dose was 0.4 mg/kg, administered 5 days/week. A total of 12 subjects 
were added in sequence and were started on doses of 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06 mg, or 0.001/kg/day based on incoming safety data. Overall, subjects in PAL-004 who initiated trea tment at 
higher daily doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg/day achieved immediate and substantial reduction of blood Phe levels, but dosing had to be temporarily reduced or interrupted due to the onset of systemic hypersensitivity reactions at approximately Day [ADDRESS_224725] in the setting of temporary dose reduction or interruption, but Phe levels generally improved if higher dose levels were reinstated.  
To prevent the onset of hypersensitivity reactions that were temporally associated  with the 
onset of anti-drug IgM responses, an additional dosing strategy was assessed in PAL-004; - protocol.pdf Page 972

administration once per week at a low dose (2.5mg) with gradual escalation and conversion 
of dose administration to 5x/week dosing for chronic maintenance therapy.  
Once subjects have completed Study  165-205, they are eligible to enroll into this study to 
continue to receive rAvPAL-PEG up to a maximum dose of 5.0 mg/kg/week or 375 mg/week, or into the Phase 3 study, 165-302. 
7.3 Study Rationale 
PKU is an autosomal, recessive, inherited disease characterized by [CONTACT_189448]. Approximately 1 in every 10,000 infants in North America is born with PKU (Scriver,  2001, McGraw- Hill) . Left untreated, PAH deficiency is associated with an 
abnormally elevated concentration of Phe, which is toxic to the brain (Kaufman, 1989, J Pediatr.)  and can result in a variety of neuropathologic conditions, including mental 
retardation, microcephaly, delayed speech, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities (Scriver,  2001, McGraw -Hill) . The brains of untreated patients with PKU show evidence of 
hypomyelination and gliosis, arrest in cerebral development, and, in some cases, white matter degeneration (Huttenlocher, 2000, Eur.J Pediatr.) . Elevated Phe during fetal development 
leads to severe mental retardation and can cause microcephaly, growth retardation, and congenital heart disease (Guttler, 2003, Pediatrics), (Koch, 2003, Pediatrics), (Lee, 2003, 
Pediatrics), (Levy, 2003, Pediatrics), (Matalon, 2003, Pediatrics), (Rouse, 2004, J.Pediatr.) . 
For a subset of patients with residual enzyme activity, treatment with Kuvan
® is an option. 
For all other patients, current management of PKU involves adherence to low- Phe medicinal 
diet formulas and dietary restriction of Phe-containing foods. Implementation of a Phe-restricted diet in infancy significantly reduces blood Phe concentrations and prevents many of the neuropathologic manifestations of PKU, including severe mental retardation. However, compliance with this restrictive diet c an be difficult for older children, adolescents, 
and adults, and adherence may result in nutritional deficiencies due to the limitations of natural protein sources (Fisch, 2000, Eur.J.Pediatr.), (Walter, 2002, Lancet) . 
The need exists for a treatment that will help individuals with PKU safely achieve lifelong, 
reliable control of blood phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and improve functional outcomes. rAvPAL- PEG is a potential substitute for the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) 
enzyme, which is defective in individuals with PKU. rAvPAL-PEG may control blood Phe concentrations, which may have additional clinical benefits.  
Blood Phe levels depend not only on the functional presence of the endogenous enzyme PAH 
but also on the dietary intake of Phe. It is important to understand the role of diet on blood Phe levels concurrent with the administration of rAvPAL- PEG treatment. Therefore, an - protocol.pdf Page 974

Proprietary and Confidential Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224726] diet are not allowed in 
this study unless per the Investigator. Diet will be monitored using a diet diary.     
A pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of 
rAvPAL -PEG in up to [ADDRESS_224727] already achieved Phe reduction to within the protocol- defined target range.  
This study is an extension of previous rAvPAL-PEG Phase 2 studies. Administration of rAvPAL -PEG will be continued to assess the long- term safety and efficacy of rAvPAL -PEG 
in PKU subjects. 
7.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Benefits 
It is not expected that data from previous rAvPAL -PEG studies will change the assumption 
that rAvPAL-PEG has a toxicity profile similar to other recombinant PEGylated non-human 
enzymes currently in use. The toxicities of these drugs usually fall into 2 main categories: toxicity due to exposure to PEG, and toxicity due to immunologic sensitization. In addition, exaggerated pharmacological effects resulting in very low Phe concentrations could be observed. Other adverse events (AEs) that could occur with rAvPAL-PEG include injection -site reactions a nd other general symptoms. 
7.4.1 Toxicity Due to Exposure to Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 
Acute exposure to high doses of PEG can result in renal toxicity. There have been a few reports of PEG -related AEs in humans; cumulative intravenous (IV) PEG doses of 121 to 
240 g caused acute renal tubular necrosis, oliguria, and azotemia. The anticipated PEG exposure associated with the expected rAvPAL -PEG dose range (6 g per week) is at least 
80-fold lower than the reported toxic doses and comparable to exposures to PEG in w idely
used medicines and other compounds that are administered by [CONTACT_109516], oral, rectal, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_189428] (Webster, 2007, Drug Metab Dispos.) . No indication of PEG- related toxicity at the
ultrastructural level was observed in monkeys given a single dose of up to 60 mg/kgrAvPAL -PEG SC. In rats, both renal tubule vacuolation and histiocytic cell vacuoles have
been assocated with PEG -related catabolism and administration of other PEGylated proteins

Proprietary and Confidential Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224728] been no reported events of 
glomerulonephritis or renal failure reported with pegvaliase administration. Of the 10 subjects identified with UAC ratios  ≥ 3 mg/mmol on 3 or more consecutive 
measurem ents, values were generally in the microalbuminuria range and none had concurrent 
sustained hematuria. Seven of these 10 subjects had microalbuminuria at baseline prior to pegvaliase exposure, of which 2 events resolved while on pegvaliase treatment and 4 events did not progress while subjects remained on pegvaliase. One of these 7 subjects with baseline microalbuminuria (3.62 mg/mmol at baseline) had an increase in their UAC ratio during the study, which was more apparent after dose titration to 60 mg of pegvaliase (remaining in microalbuminuria range, with a most recent value of 20.36 mg/mmol), however evaluating relationship to pegvaliase treatment is confounded by a medical history of obesity, hypertension, and new onset pre- diabetes during the Phase [ADDRESS_224729] had a maximum UAC ratio of 175 mg/g on Day 8 on the study; at the time of study and study drug discontinuation (Day 36), UAC ratio was within the normal range at 19 mg/g. The final study visit recorded for this subject (Day 67) had a UAC ratio of 17 mg/g.  This subject reported a single concurrent grade [ADDRESS_224730] developed sustained elevations in serum creatinine or concurrent sustained hematuria.  
To monitor for renal toxicity, subjects participating in this study will undergo urinalysis, will be assessed for urine albumin/creatini ne ratio, and will undergo blood chemistry tests to 
assess renal function.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_224731] partially inaccessible by [CONTACT_189689] (Gamez, 2007, Mol.Genet.Metab) . In vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that 
PEGylation of proteins and cells can attenuate the immunological response (Scott, 1997, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A), (Chen, 2001, BioDrugs.) . PEGylation has been effective in - protocol.pdf Page 976

Proprietary and Confidential Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
reducing anti -rAvPAL antibody titers in the mouse model but does not eliminate antibody 
formation. Although PEGylation of rAvPAL likely reduces the antigeni city of the molecule, 
100% of individuals exposed to rAvPAL-PEG develop antibodies against rAvPAL.  
Drug -specific immune responses can range from clinical irrelevance to causing serious 
hypersensitivity AEs (such as anaphylaxis) and may reduce efficacy due to 
antibody- mediated drug clearance or antibody neutralization of enzymatic activity. 
Historically, PEG was thought to be nonimmunogenic (Davis, 1981, Clin.Exp.Immunol.), (Harris, 2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.);  however, repeated studies have found that 
subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous exposure to PEG can induce anti- PEG antibodies 
(Harris,  2003, Nat.Rev.Drug Discov.), (Richter, 1983, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.). In 
some instances, development of such antibodies did not result in significant clinical eff ects in 
humans (Richter, 1984, Int.Arch.Allergy Appl.Immunol.) . However, PEG antibody responses 
were associated with hypersensitivity reactions to PEGylated liposomes (Judge, 2006, 
Mol.Ther.) . Anti-PEG antibodies have also been associated with nonresponsiveness against 
therapy (Armstrong, 2007, Cancer), (Ganson, 2006, Arthritis Res.Ther.) . 
Subjects participating in the Phase [ADDRESS_224732] been monitored closely for anti-drug immunogenicity (anti-rAvPAL immunoglobulin G [IgG], anti- rAvPAL IgM, 
anti-PEG IgM, anti -PEG IgG, neutralizing antibodies that inhibit PAL enzymatic activity, 
anti-rAvPAL IgE, and anti -rAvPAL -PEG IgE), complements, C -reactive protein (CRP), 
ESR, and complete chemistry. All subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in the Phase [ADDRESS_224733] 
detected within 2 -3 weeks of treatment initiation and anti- rAvPAL IgG antibodies were 
detected within 2 -3 months. The anti-rAvPAL IgG response generally peaked by 3-5 months 
and was sustained in all subjects. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) capable of inhibiting enzymatic activity were detected in a minority of subjects 2 -3 months after treatment 
initiation. The timing of the NAb response suggests these antibodies may be a component of the anti -rAvPAL IgG response. It is expected that the centralized location of the PAL active 
site, within the tetrameric structure, makes it difficult for antibodies to bind and inhibit enzymatic activity. In addition, anti-PAL antibody binding is likely sterically hindered by [CONTACT_189667]. The majority of treated subjects also developed a transient anti- PEG 
antibody response. The anti- PEG response was comprised of IgM and IgG isotypes. In 
general, anti -PEG antibodies were no l onger detected after 5 -6 months of treatment. This 
type of transient antibody response is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] T cell-independent type 2 (TI-2) responses. 
The majority of immune -mediated AEs experienced in subjects treated with rAvPAL -PEG in 
the Phase 2 studies are believed to be the result of antibody-mediated hypersensitivity. The - protocol.pdf Page 977

anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a, C5a) that can induce hypersensitivity symptoms. Although IgG immune complexes can also activate the classical complement pathway, they do so with less efficiency than IgM. This is due, in part, to the requirement for multiple Fc regions in close proximity to activate the complement cascade, meaning that multiple monomeric IgG Abs are required to bind, whereas only one pentameric IgM Ab is needed to bind to acti vate 
complement. Also, in the case of rAvPAL-PEG, binding of anti-PAL IgG antibodies is likely compromised due to epi[INVESTIGATOR_189400], which may reduce IgG- mediated 
complement activation in vivo . This complex dynamic between combined isotype- specific 
Ab responses and epi[INVESTIGATOR_189401] a major factor dictating the need for an induction and titration dose regimen in the treatment of rAvPAL- PEG to be implemented

hypersensitivity reactions. Because of the potential for anaphylaxis, equipment for emergen cy resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) should be within easy access during and 
after the rAvPAL -PEG injection. Subject should be pre-medicated with H1 antagonist, H2 
antagonist, and antipyretics  (eg, acetaminophen) approximately 2-3 hours prior to each dose 
of study drug for one week upon return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. If non- steroidal anti -inflammatory medication (NSAIDs) is  administered as a 
premedication, it should be given with food.  Subjects who qualify for self- administration of 
study drug are trained to recognize a serious hypersensitivity AEs and how to respond. Additionally, subjects are given two epi[INVESTIGATOR_189402] (Section 9.4). Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for

9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a long-term extension of rAvPAL -PEG Phase 2 studies in up to 100 subjects with 
PKU. The doses are planned to be in the same range as those previously tested in the Phase 2 
studies (starting at 0.001 through 5.0 mg/kg/week or 2.5 mg through 375 mg/week ), provided 
no dose- limiting toxicity was observed in a previous rAvPAL -PEG studies. Subjects’ doses 
will not exceed 375 mg/week. 
Only subjects who completed a previous rAvPAL- PEG study will be enrolled into this study. 
Subjects enrolling into PAL-[ADDRESS_224737] their starting dose determined per the sponsor’s 
medical monitor.  The first week of dosing will be administered in the clinic, and the subject must be observed for 30 minutes following administration. Subjects are given two epi[INVESTIGATOR_189402] (refer to Section  9.4). A  follow- up telephone call will be made to the subject to monitor 
subject safety [ADDRESS_224738] diet, a diet diary will be issued to subjects for 
completion and will be brought to clinic monthly for review with the clinical study staff.  
Subjects may self -administer study drug at home if approved by [CONTACT_189668]’s medical monitor and if adequate training is demonstrated. Subjects must meet a set of criteria to be considered appropriate for self- administration. Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_224739] is introduced, every 24 weeks, and more often as needed. 
Subjects will be evaluated for safety throughout the study. Toxicity will be measured 
according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),  version  4. - protocol.pdf Page 981
 PAL -003 A8 Page 41 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
In addition to the Sponsor, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety of 
subjects in the study. The DMC is an independent committee that will act in an advisory 
capacity to the Sponsor. 
PAL -003 is designed to evaluate long- term treatment of subjects who are continuing to take 
rAvPAL -PEG. Subjects’previous rAvPAL-PEG dosing will generally continue in PAL-003. 
In PAL -003, each subject’s dose will be adjusted as needed to attempt to attain or maintain 
blood Phe concentrations of 60-600 µmol/L. rAvPAL -PEG dose will be based on either a 
subject’s weight or will be a fixed dose. Doses will be evaluated on an individual basis.  Evaluations, observations, and procedures will be conducted at selected time points as shown 
in Table 9.1.[ADDRESS_224740]’s blood Phe concentration has been 
controlled to within a target range (60 -600 µmol/L), the subject may be asked to have 
additional blood draws for PK and blood Phe concentration analyses as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs: 
• The subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study. 
• The subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor. 
• The subject has completed the study through the Week 476 visit.   
• The study is terminated.  
• The study drug receives marketing authorizatio n.  
 
Because the risks of taking BMN 165 during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown, 
subjects cannot take BMN 165 if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding (refer to Section 9.3.2 for Exclusion Crit eria). Male subjects who are planning 
to impregnate a female partner and female subjects who are trying to become pregnant during the study must be temporarily discontinued from study drug for [ADDRESS_224741] use two acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who are planning to become pregnant (or impregnate a female partner) may modify their diet in consultation with the investigator and/or study dietician. Subjects who are confirmed to be pregnant per a serum pregnancy test and are temporarily off study drug are 
not required to perform the scheduled urine pregnancy tests. Subjects who are pregnant or are trying to conceive and have temporarily discontinued study drug should not perform the 
scheduled  PK assessments. Male subjects who have impregnated a female partner may - protocol.pdf Page 982

re-start study drug after conception following the investigator’s consultation with and 
approval by [CONTACT_7195]. Male subjects must return to the study-required 
contraception use (refer to Section 9.3.1 for Inclusion Criteria), which must include one 
barrier method, prior to restarting study drug. F emale subjects who remain in the study after 
temporary discontinuation of study drug due to pregnancy may restart BMN [ADDRESS_224742] result, the birth has been reported (or termination of the pregnancy), and breastfeeding has completed (if applicable) or after the subject is no longer actively trying to conceive. Re-starting BMN 165 dosing requires the investigator’s 
prior consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_7195]. Female subjects must return to the study-required contraception use (refer to Section 9.3.1), which must include one barrier 
method, immediately after the birth (or termination of the pregnancy).  
Subjects may withdraw from treatment with study drug at any time; however, subjects will 
be asked to continue to perform the study assessments until study completion. Subjects may also withdraw from study participation at any time. Because the completeness of the data affects the integrity, accuracy, and interpretation of study results, every effort should be made to retain subjects in the study and to have them complete the study assessments as scheduled as long as continued participation does not compromise subject safety.  
A PK substudy has been added to evaluate the steady- state PK of rAvPAL -PEG in up to 
[ADDRESS_224743] additional pre-dose PK sampling performed (refer to Table 9.1.2).

9.1.1 Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events  
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout the study and are trained to recognize potential 
hypersensitivity AEs (including anaphylaxis) and how to respond. Subjects are instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_189660]. The investigator may require further evaluation at the clinic. If a hypersens itivity AE (eg, injection -site reaction, rash, joint 
pain, itching) occurs, the subject may be advised to premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and antipyretics  (eg, acetaminophen) approximately 2-3 hours prior to subsequent 
rAvPAL -PEG doses. If NSAIDs  are administered as a premedication, they  should be given 
with food. Subjects who experience an injection -site skin reaction that lasts 
 ≥ [ADDRESS_224758] for consultation and a skin biopsy. 
Hypersensitivity AEs, including anaphylaxis, are expected with rAvPAL -PEG 
administration.  rAvPAL-PEG dosing in response to a suspected hypersensitivity AE may be 
modified or halted depending on the severity of the event and suspected rAvPAL- PEG 
causality (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Severity for hypersensitivity AEs will be per NCI- CTCAE 
grades.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189403] ≥ 3 hypersensitivity AE that is related to study drug and is suspected to meet Brown’s criteria for severe (grade 3) in the judgment of the investigator and the sponsor’s medical monitor may be permanently discontinued from study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosing in Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events 
Dosing in response to a hypersensitivity AE depends on the NCI-CTCAE grade and 
suspected relationship to rAvPAL-PEG. Dosing instructions are presented in Table [IP_ADDRESS].1 and are regardless of previous occurrence: - protocol.pdf Page 988

e If the investigator determines that the NCI -CTCAE grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_224759] will be asked to return to the clinic within 24  hours of event onset for 
evaluation, including laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, anti -rAvPAL IgE, 
anti-rAvPAL -PEG IgE [sampling must be performed >8 hours after event onset and before the next dose of 
study  drug] , urine albumin/creatinine ratio, urinary N -methyl histamine, CRP, C3, C4, and tryptase) .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Response to Anaphylaxis 
If the investigator suspects that the event is anaphylaxis, the subject will be assessed in the 
clinic. Laboratory assessments for suspected anaphylaxis events should be performed prior to the next administration of study drug (if applicable) and include anti-rAvPAL IgE and - protocol.pdf Page 989

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
anti-rAvPAL -PEG IgE (sampling must be performed >8 hours after event onset and before

will consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor, and a decision will then be made whether to discontinue the subject from study drug, restart dosing at the same dose level, or restart dosing a t a lower dose level.  
For the first week of dosing after resolution of anaphylaxis, the study drug will be administered in a clinic setting with equipment for emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within easy access.  The subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224760], and antipyretics  (eg, acetaminophen) approximately 
2-3 hours prior to each dose of study drug for one week upon return to dosing regardless of the duration of dose interruption. If NSAIDs  are administered as a premedication, they  
should be given with food.

9.1.3 Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Increase Methodology  
Each subject’s dose may be modified based on the decision of the Investigator. Decisions 
regarding dose increases will depend on a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe and drug concentrat ions. 
An individual subject’s dose may be adjusted beginning on Day [ADDRESS_224762]’s dose may be adjusted if warranted per a subject’s adverse event profile and blood Phe concentrations. Dose increases should be performed as follows: 
• The dose may be increased by [CONTACT_189438] 10-fold higher than the 
subject’s current dose. 
• When increasing the dose, a dose may be used that is between the dose levels (0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, a nd 5.0 mg/kg or 
2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 225, 300, 375 mg/week) or per Investigator determination 
based on available information regarding a subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L) as well as any adverse events for an individual subject.
 Dose increases  > 350 mg/week 
require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  
• The dose may be adjusted by [CONTACT_189534] a total weekly 
dose not to exceed 5.0 mg/kg or 375 mg/week. Dose increases  > 350 mg/week require consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
• When a dose is increased, the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224763] modified dose administration. Subjects who increase their dose frequency do not need to be observed following injection of study drug if the increase in frequency does not increase the overall weekly dose amount. 
• Only 1 dose adjustment is allowed every 2 weeks. - protocol.pdf Page 991
 PAL -003 A8 Page 51 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Decrease Methodology  
Decisions regarding dose decreases will depend on available infor mation regarding a 
subject’s blood Phe (60-600 µmol/L), as well as any adverse event (any hypersensitivity 
reaction as defined in Section 9.1.1). Dose decreases may occur for hypophenylalanemia or 
any adverse ev ent that may be improved with a lower dose. 
A dose should first be reduced by [CONTACT_15994] (5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.06, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003, 0.001 mg/kg or 375, 300, 225, 150, 75, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 mg/week). It is also per mitted to decrease dose in between these specified dose levels. If 
further dosing adjustments are required in response to safety, dosing frequency may also be adjusted.  
If the subject develops low blood Phe (as defined by a blood Phe level ≤ 30 µmol/L ), the 
subject’s rAvPAL-PEG dose should be decreased to the next lower dose.  If the condition persists after another [ADDRESS_224764] may be asked to consult the dietician to eliminate medical foods and/or formulas and to ensure a balanced and nutritious diet (as part of the routine standard of care for PKU disease management, subject diet should be monitored by a dietician).

the hypersensitivity AE worsens with a repeat injection (as determined by [CONTACT_189673]’s medical monitor) even with premedication prior to study drug 
dosing, the subject must be withdrawn from the study and complete an Early Termination Visit.  
Subjects who have had a prior hypersensitivity AE to rAvPAL- PEG or a PEG -containing 
product may pa rticipate in this study (refer to Section  9.3.2).  
Use of any medication that is intended to treat PKU within [ADDRESS_224785] decision or per the Investigator. After a do sing interruption of ≥ four consecutive 
doses, rAvPAL-PEG administration should be re- started at the same dose level and dosing 
frequency that was administered prior to the dosing interruption. The first week of dosing of rAvPAL -PEG following a dose interruption should be administered in a clinic setting, and 
the subject must be observed for [ADDRESS_224786], and antipyretics  
(eg, acetaminophen) approximately 2 -3 hours prior to study drug should be administered 
following any dose interruption of ≥ four consecutive doses. If NSAIDs  are administered as a 
premedication, they should be given with food. A follow -up telephone call will be made to

destroyed or missing study drug or study materials.  
Unused study drug may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating procedures, but only after BioMarin has granted approval for drug destruction. The monitor must account for all study drug in a formal reconciliation process prior to study drug destruction. All study drug destroyed on site must be documented. Documentation must be provided to BioMarin and retained in the PIs study files. If a site is unable to destroy study drug appropriately, the site can return unused study drug to BioMarin upon request. The return of study drug or study drug materials must be accounted for on a Study Drug Return Form provided by [CONTACT_189447]. 
Subjects who qualify for self-administration of study drug will be provided with instructions 
for returning used and unused study drug and the proper disposal of any study drug materials (refer to the Subject Self -Administration Training Materials).

10 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS   
10.1 Adverse Events  
For this protocol, a reportable adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence 
(e.g.,  sign, symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study- drug or 
other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the course of the 
study.  
• Pre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_189577].  
• Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to scree ning procedures, medication washout, or no- treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationshi p between the study -drug and the AE. 
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of terms relating to a diagnosis.  
The study AE reporting period is as follows:
 After informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study drug, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported.  
After informed consent is obtained and the first administration of study drug, all non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begins and continues until [ADDRESS_224798] 
administration of study drug or the Study Completion Visit/Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs last  (refer to Section 12). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of 
SAEs is provided in Section 10.2.  
For this study, a medical device is defined as the prefilled syringe and all of the component 
parts. The reporting period for device- related events begins with the first dose administered 
using prefilled syringe and ends with the last dose administered using prefilled syringe. Events assessed by [CONTACT_189674], including malfunction, injury, or medication error, will be captured into an electronic data capture sys tem. All serious events 
related to the device will be reported to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV) within 24 hours using the device-related event report form and entered onto the appropriate eCRF page(s) as required.  - protocol.pdf Page 1011
 PAL -003 A8 Page 71 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224799] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. Outcome of AEs (and resolution dates) should be documented on the appropriate CRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record unless the subject is lost to follow -up or it has been determined that the study drug or study 
participation is not the cause of the AE. 
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, relationship to study-drug, and seriousness (see  Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe headache) is not equivalent to seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
The Investigat or will determine the severity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Adverse events that 
do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below. 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)a 
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self care activities of 
daily living (ADL)b 
4 Life threatening or debilitating: consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
Grade 4 and 5 AEs should always be reported as SAEs.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189431] c lothes, using 
the telephone, managing money.  
b Self care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the 
toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.  - protocol.pdf Page 1012

on the source documents and AE CRF, using the categories defined below. 
Relationship  Description  
Not Related  Exposure to the IP has not occurred  
OR 
The administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not reasonably related in time  
OR 
The AE is considered likely to be related to an etiology other than the use of the IP; that is, 
there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a causal relationship to the IP.  
Possibly Related  The administration of the IP  and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in time  
AND  
The AE could be explained equally well by [CONTACT_189578].  
Probably Related  The administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE are reasonably related in ti me  
AND  
The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_189579].  
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_189580], using MedDRA (Medical Dictionar y for Regulatory Activities terminology).  
 
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to) the 
following: 
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given patient or disease state  
• Absence of event prior to study drug exposure 
• Consistency with study product pharmacology 
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action 
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or recurrence of AE with reintroduction of study drug

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
10.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets 
1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal.  
• Is life threatening.  
o Note: Life -threatening refers to an event that places the subject at immediate 
risk of death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy. 
• Important medical events or reactions that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189426]. 
For this protocol, anaphylaxis per NIAID/FAAN criter ia for the clinical diagnosis of 
anaphylaxis is designated as an AE of special interest (serious or nonserious and irrespective 
of severity) to facilitate rapid reporting and sponsor review. All occurrences of anaphylaxis per NIAID/FAAN criteria will be re ported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site 
becoming aware of the event using the SAE form. Severity and serious criteria (if applicable) should be reported on the SAE form. 
The reporting period for SAEs related to protocol imposed interventions begi ns after 
informed consent is obtained, the reporting period for all SAEs begins after first dose of 
study drug and continues until [ADDRESS_224801] administered dose. 
All SAEs (including serious device-related events), whether or not considered related to 
study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of  the event by 
[CONTACT_189581]-specific SAE Report Form or device Report Form to BioMarin Pharmacovigilance (BPV). Each SAE must also be reported in the CRF Investigators should not wait to collect information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of a SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that Investigators - protocol.pdf Page 1014
 PAL -003 A8 Page 74 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224802] to follow -up, or it has been determined that the study drug or participation is 
not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented in the CRF and in the subject’s medical record. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed necessary to appropriately eva luate 
the SAE report (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant report, or autopsy report). 
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB will be done in compliance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB and with applicable regulatory requirements. Adequate documentation must be obtained by [CONTACT_189627]. 
10.3 Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (eg, cascade events) should be iden tified 
by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. However, 
medically important events that may be linked and/or separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the eCRF. For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
10.[ADDRESS_224803] 
evaluation time points. Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs  and resolves between subject  evaluation time points,  but 
then subsequently recurs. All recurrences of the AE should be individually recorded as a 
separate event on the AE eCRF. 
10.[ADDRESS_224804] results will be recorded on the lab oratory results pages of the eCRF, or 
appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the central laboratory, if applicable. 
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 1015
 PAL -003 A8 Page 75 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224805] to confirm the abnormality and any one or more of the following conditions is met: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_189691]  
• Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation of, or any other change in a conc omita nt medication, therapy or 
treatment).  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (eg, change of dose, discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol specified safety and efficacy laboratory result 
from tests performed after the first dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory reference range and meets the clini cal significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that falls outside the laboratory reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type 
explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_760], or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.   
10.6 Pre-existing Conditions 
A pre -existing condition is one that is pres ent at the start of the study. Such conditions should 
be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre -existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period. It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre-existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_189692] (eg, more frequent headaches). 
10.7 General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abn ormality should be recorded as a pre- existing 
condition (refer to Section 10.6). During the study, any new clinically significant findings 
and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of an A E 
(or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 1016

Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189432] (refer to 
Section 10.2).  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189433]. These scenarios includ e planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189434]: 
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement  
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre- existing medical 
condition that has not changed in severity 
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication 
10.9 Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the AE reporting period (refer to Section 10.1 for nonserious 
AEs and  Section 10.2 for SAEs), regardless  of attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF 
and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal 
outcome should be recorded as the sing le medical concept on the eCRF.  If the cause of death 
is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF.   
10.[ADDRESS_224806] through resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or termination) and to report the resolution to BPV in the study reference materials. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the Investigator should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected health information. - protocol.pdf Page 1017

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE (as the 
Sponsor considers these to be medically significant), recorded on the eCRF, and expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. 
10.11 Follow- up of Subjects after Adverse Events  
For some SAEs and AESI s, the sponsor may follow up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, 
and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], 
consultant report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report.  
10.[ADDRESS_224807] to report to the 
investigator and/or to BPV directly  any subseque nt SAEs that the subject ’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The i nvestigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject  has discontinued or terminat ed study participation if the i nvestigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been related  to prior study treatment. The sponsor should 
also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in 
this study.

occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the Investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The sponsor shall forthwith inform the competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/EC/REB is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for these events which may 
require the implementation of urgent safety measures is the period from the time of signing of the ICF through the completion of the last study visit or at the ETV. Investigators are required to report any events which may require the implementation of urgent safety measures to BioMarin with 24 hours. - protocol.pdf Page 1018

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
Examples of situations that may require urgent safety measures include discovery of the 
following: 
• Immediate need to revise the IP administration  (i.e., modified dose amount or 
frequency not defined in protocol). 
• Lack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management. 
• Discovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
14.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Because of the small sample size, no formal statistical tests will be performed. Categorical 
data will be summarized using frequency and percent, while continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (ie, number of observations, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details about the planned statistical analysis.  
14.[ADDRESS_224822] postdose safety information will be included in the safety analyses. 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology (MedDRA) will be used by 
[CONTACT_189649] (CRF).  
The incidence of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. A by–subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience a serious AE (SAE), including death, or experience an AE associated with early withdrawa l from the study or study drug. Hypersensitivity AEs and AEs that result in dosing 
interruption or dose level reduction are of interest, and the percentage of subjects who report these AEs will be presented.  
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. Frequency and percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference range) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory test. For each clinical laboratory test, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post- treatment visits. Changes from baseline to the 
post- treatment visits will also be provided. Descriptive statistics of vital signs, physical 
examinati on results, ECG results, and X- ray results, and immunogenicity test results will also 
be provided. Additionally, antibodies and titers will be summarized by [CONTACT_51256].

data become available from previous rAvPAL- PEG studies that indicate study drug 
accumulation should also be measured, additional blood draws may be added for PK analysis 
as needed per the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
14.3.[ADDRESS_224824]- treatment efficacy data will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
Blood Phe concentration at each scheduled time point will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Change in blood Phe concentration from baseline (to be defined in the SAP) to each scheduled time point and presence/absence of antibodies will also be summarized. In addition, the proportion of subjects who have maintained target Phe co ncentrations of 60-600 µmol/L will be summarized by [CONTACT_189594]. 
The relationship of dietary Phe intake (per information reported on the subject diet diary) and 
blood Phe concentration will also be explored. Subjects who received any amount of study drug with any post-treatment blood Phe concentration measurements and diet diary information will be included in this exploratory analysis.  
Details regarding exploratory analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
14.5 Determination of Sample Size  
Subjects who participated in previous rAvPAL-PEG studies may be enrolled into this study. 
No formal sample size calculation was conducted for this study or the PAL-003 Substudy.   
14.6 Handling of Missing Data 
All analyses will be presented based on  observed data only. Missing data will not be imputed 
for analyses unless sensitivity analyses are warranted. If imputations are used, detailed 
imputation methods will be described in the SAP before locking the database. - protocol.pdf Page 1028

15 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC)  
The DMC will act independently in an advisory capacity to BioMarin to monitor the safety 
of rAvPAL -PEG in subjects who participate in the study.  
The responsibilities of the DMC are to: 
• Review the study protocol, informed consent and assent documents, and plans for 
data monitoring. 
• Evaluate the progress of the trial, subjects’ risk versus benefit, and other factors that 
could affect the study outcome. 
• Assess the effect and relevance of new external evidence.  
• Consider relevant information that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participan ts or the ethics of the study. 
• Protect the safety of the study participants in accordance with the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_189370] 9.1.2. 
• Make recommendations to the BioMarin concerning continuation or termination of the study or other study modifications based on observations. - protocol.pdf Page 1030

The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_189584] a study subject has been injured by [CONTACT_44528]. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by [CONTACT_189473] a pre-specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment 
facility if necessary. The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_187696], and assistance with, treatment for study- related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party 
payer for the cost of this medical treatment, unless the executed Clinical Trial Agreement between BioMarin and the institution of the investigator specifies  otherwise. If the subject 
has followed the Investigator’s instructions, BioMarin may pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_189693] f or study-related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.  - protocol.pdf Page 1031

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224828] be completed using a web–based application that has been validated. Study site 
personnel will be trained on the application and will enter the clinical data from source documentation. Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable.  
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the site personnel will correct the value by [CONTACT_189694]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the site personnel to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the or iginal value, the new value, the time of the correction, and 
the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, which 
necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and  subject records. 
In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated). The Investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their  medical records, and subjects will be informed 
of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent.  
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_189630] “source data verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the response and determine either to close the query or re–query the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s CRF casebook can be locked, all data fields must be SDV and all queries 
closed. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, visits, and the entire casebook to locked. The i nvestigator will then electronically sign the casebook, 
specifying that the  information on the CRFs is accurate and complete. Upon completion of 
the clinical study report for the entire study, an electronic copy of each site’s casebooks will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a compact disk (CD) and sent to each site for retention with other study documents. - protocol.pdf Page 1032

24 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT TEXT REVISIONS   
The following is a summary of significant protocol revisions; added text is underlined and deleted text is struck . Additional administrative 
changes have been made for consistency and clarity throughout this amendment and are reflected in the protocol body. Revisions made to the 
Synopsis (Section 2) are reflected in the corresponding protocol section as appropriate. Revisions to cross references to protocol tables, figures, sections, and references reside within the protocol body.  
Section  Revision  Rationale for 
Change  
Global change  Up to [ADDRESS_224844], and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medication 
(NSAIDs) antipyretics (eg,  acetaminophen)  approximately 2 -3 hours prior to study drug should be 
administered for 1 week upon reintroduction of study drug at Part 3, Week 1 and Part 4, Week 1, 
as well as upon reintroduction of study drug after resolution of an AE, following any dose interruption of  ≥ 4 days, and for any dose increases in Part 4. If non- steroidal anti- inflammatory 
medication (NSAIDs) is administered as a premedication, it NSAIDs  should be given with food 
and may be omitted if not tolerated . 6 
Section 7.4.1, Toxicity 
Due to Exposure to 
Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)  Based on phase [ADDRESS_224845] been no reported events of 
glomerulonephritis or renal failure reported with pegvaliase administration. Of the 10  subjects 
identified with UAC ratios  ≥ 3 mg/mmol on 3 or more consecutive measurements, values were 
generally in the microalbuminuria range and none had concurrent sustained hematuria. Seven of 
these 10  subjects had microalbuminuria at baseline prior to pegvaliase exposure, of which 2 
events resolved while on pegvaliase treatment and 4 events did not progress while subjects 
remained on pegvaliase. One of these 7 subjects with baseline microal buminuria (3.62 mg/mmol 
at baseline) had an increase in their UAC ratio during the study, which was more apparent after 
dose titration to 60 mg of pegvaliase (remaining in microalbuminuria range, with a most recent 
value of 20.36 mg/mmol), however evaluating relationship to pegvaliase treatment is confounded 1 - protocol.pdf Page 1040
 PAL -003 A8 Page  100 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224846] had a maximum UAC ratio of 
175 mg/g on Day 8 on the study; at the time of study and study drug discontinuation (Day 36), 
UAC ratio was within the normal range at 19 mg/g. The final study visit recorded for this subject 
(Day 67) had a UAC ratio of 17 mg/g.  This subject reported a single concurrent grade [ADDRESS_224847] developed sustained elevations in serum 
creatinine or concurrent sustained  hematuria.  
To monitor for renal toxicity, subjects participating in this study will undergo urinalysis, will be 
assessed for urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and will undergo blood chemistry tests to assess renal 
function. In this study, subjects will be monitored closely with urine examinations and blood 
chemistries to follow kidney function. 
Section 9.1, Overall Study 
Design and Plan  A subject will continue in PAL -003 until one of the following occurs:  
• The subject has completed the study through the Month 98Week 476 visit.  9 - protocol.pdf Page 1041

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224848] include one barrier method. During 
Part 4 only, subjects who remain in the study after discontinuation of study drug due to pregnancy 
may re introduce BMN 165 dosing after the birth has been reported (or termination of the 
pregnancy) and breastfeeding has completed (if applicable) or after the subject is no longer 
actively trying to conceive. Re starting BMN [ADDRESS_224849] include one 
barrier method, immediately after the birth (or termination of the pregnancy).  
Because t he risks of taking BMN 165 during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown, subjects cannot take BMN 
165 if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding (refer to Section 9.3.2 for Exclusion Criteria). 
Male subjects who are planning to impregnate a female partner and female subjects who are trying to become 
pregnant during the study must be temporarily discontinued from study drug for [ADDRESS_224850] use two acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who are planning to become 
pregnant (or impregnate a female partner) may modify their diet in consultation with the investigator and/or study 
dietician. Subjects who are confirmed to be pregnant per a serum pregnancy test and are temporari ly off study drug 
are not required to perform the scheduled urine pregnancy tests. Subjects who are pregnant or are trying to conceive 
and have temporarily discontinued study drug should not perform the scheduled PK assessments. Male subjects who 
have impr egnated a female partner may re -start study drug after conception following the investigator’s consultation 
with and approval by [CONTACT_7195]. Male subjects must return to the study -required contraception use (refer to 
Section 9.3.1 for Inclusion Cr iteria), which must include one barrier method, prior to restarting study drug. Female 
subjects who remain in the study after temporary discontinuation of study drug due to pregnancy may restart BMN 
165 dosing after a confirmed negative urine pregnancy tes t result, the birth has been reported (or termination of the 
pregnancy), and breastfeeding has completed (if applicable) or after the subject is no longer actively trying to 
conceive. Re -starting BMN 165 dosing requires the investigator’s prior consultatio n with and approval by [CONTACT_35011]. Female subjects must return to the study -required contraception use (refer to Section 9.3.1), which must 
include one barrier method, immediately after the birth (or termination of the pregnancy).  2 - protocol.pdf Page 1042

if results were within normal range at baseline. Subjects who had elevated results at baseline 
followed by a confirmed subsequent increase of 100-200 mg/g from baseline should also be 
referred to a nephrologist for consultation.

[IP_ADDRESS]. 1 (Clinical 
Laboratory Tests)  The table has been revised to add the following footnotes:  
a To be performed by [CONTACT_12115]. If urine pregnancy test is positive or equivocal, serum 
sample will be taken and assessed by a central laboratory. It is recommended that urine samples 
are obtained as a first or second morning void. In the event of elevated urinary protein on a test 
result, a repeat urinalysis should be performed. This repeat urine sample must performed in the 
morning at the first or second morning void to allow for accurate test results and may be 
performed by a home healthcare nurse.

Section  Revision  Rationale for 
Change  
All samples collected in this study may be used for exploratory research. In addition, samples 
collected for other purposes may be used for exploratory research use once the primary use has 
been completed.  
Section 10.1., Adverse 
Events  Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but a re not limited to) the following:  
• Plausible temporal relationship  
• Absence of alternative explanations  
• Rarity of event in a given patient or disease state  
• Absence of event prior to study drug exposure 
• Consistency with study product pharmacology 
• Known relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action 
• Similarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products  
• Abatement of AE with discontinuation of study drug, and/or recurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of study drug 3 
Section 10.3, Adverse 
Event s Occurring 
Secondary to Other 
Events  In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (eg, cascade events) should be identified by 
[CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have resulted in dehydration, it is 
sufficient to record  only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. However, medically important 
events that may be linked and/or separated in time should be recorded as independent events on 
the eCRF. For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
recorded separately on the eCRF.  3 - protocol.pdf Page 1045
 PAL -003 A8 Page  105 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: [ADDRESS_224857] evaluation 
time points. Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its severity increases 
or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF). 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but then 
subsequently recurs. All recurrences of the AE should be individually recorded as a separate event 
on the AE eCRF. [ADDRESS_224858] to confirm the abnormality and any one or more of the following conditions is met: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Leading to a change in study medication (e.g. dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation)  
• Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment).  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  3 - protocol.pdf Page 1046
 PAL -003 A8 Page  106 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
Section  Revision  Rationale for 
Change  
• The abno rmality is of a degree that requires active management (eg, change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.)  
 
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol specified safety and efficacy laboratory result from 
tests performed after the first dose of study medication that falls outside the laboratory reference 
range and meets the clinical significance criteria.  
This does not apply to any abnormal laboratory result that falls outside th e laboratory reference 
range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported 
as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_12695], or those which are a result of an AE that has already been reported.  
Section 10.6, Pre -existing 
Conditions  A pre -existing condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions should be 
recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF.  
A pre -existing  condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during the study period. It is important 
to convey the concept that a pre-existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_189696] (eg, more frequent headaches). 3 
Section 10.7, General 
Physical Examination 
Findings  At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a pre -existing condition 
(refer to Se ction 10.6). During the study, any new clinically significant findings and/or 
abnormalities discovered on physical examination that meet the definition of an AE (or an SAE) 
must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF. 3 - protocol.pdf Page 1047

Section  Revision  Rationale for 
Change  
Section 10.8, 
Hosp italization, 
Prolonged 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery  Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189435] (refer to Section 10.2).  
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189436]. These scenarios include planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_189437]:  
• Perform a protocol -mandated efficacy measurement  
• Undergo a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure for a pre- existing medical condition 
that has not changed  
• Receive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication 3 
Section 10.9, Deaths  All deaths that occur during the AE rep orting period (refer to Section 10.1  for nonserious AEs and 
Section 10.2 for SAEs), regardless of attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF and 
expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. 
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome 
should be recorded as the single medical concept on the eCRF. If the cause of death is unknown 
and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” or “Death of 
Unknown Cause” on the eCRF.   [ADDRESS_224859] withdraws from the study due to pregnancy…. 3 - protocol.pdf Page 1048

Proprietary and Confidential  Amendment 8: 31 March 2017 
Section  Revision  Rationale for 
Change  
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, should always be classified as an SAE (as the 
Sponsor considers these to be medically significant), recorded on the eCRF, and expeditiously 
reported to the Sponsor as an SAE. 
Section  10.11, Follow -up 
of Subjects after Adverse 
Events  For some SAEs and AESIs, the sponsor may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant 
report, or aut opsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report.  [ADDRESS_224860] to report to the 
investigator and/or to BPV directly any subsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal physician(s) 
believes might be related to prior study treatment.  
The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participati on if the investigator believes that the 
death or SAE may have been related to prior study treatment. The sponsor should also be notified 
if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly 
in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject who participated in this study.  [ADDRESS_224861] Information  Name:

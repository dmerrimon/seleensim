3.0 OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHESES  
3.1 Primary Objective & Hypothesis  
Objective:   
To determine the overall response rate as measured by [CONTACT_393] 1.[ADDRESS_828687] or subsequent line(s) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
        Hypothesis:    
Given the significant cross talk between tumor angiogenesis and the immune response, combined therapy with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in advanced gastroesophageal cancer patients will provide improved outcomes compared to standard treatment with currently approved agents. 
3.2 Secondary Objective & Hypothesis  
 Objective:   
 To determine the progression free s urvival (PFS) , overall survival  (OS), and toxicity rates 
in advanced gastroesophageal patien ts treated with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab. 
3.3 Exploratory Objective 
Objective:   
To characterize changes in the immune cell phenotype, immune pathway activity, and immune response following lenvatinib only , and then with the addition of 
pembrolizumab. 
4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.1 Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib Background  
Pemborlizumab and lenvatinib are briefly described below.  Refer to the current Inve stigator’s 
Brochures (IB)/approved labeling for details.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_828688] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformatio n has been known for decades .  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue , and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and 
long- term survival in many solid tumors.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_828689] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -
cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune res ponses, 
including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily 
member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen 
receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  Th e structure of 
murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding 
and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine- based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif 
(ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_828690] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_272446] t of signaling 
proteins .  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T  regs a nd Natural Killer cells .  Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets 
of macrophages and dendritic cells .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in  various tumors .  Both ligands are type I transmembrane 
receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain 
short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_828691] notably on vascular endothelium, 
whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in 
lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune 
T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell 
function in peripheral tissues .  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety 
of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has 
been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expans ion in s ubjects with melanoma .  This 
suggests that the PD -1/PD- L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2.  Keytruda
TM (pembrolizumab) has been approved in the United Stated for 
multiple indications including: the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma ,  patient s with metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  previously untreated 
or who have had disease progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy and  whose 
tumor express PD -L1 as de termined by [CONTACT_13247] -approved test , patients with recurrent or 
metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer with disease progression on or after platinum -
containing chemotherapy, and patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who are either ineligible or w ho have progressed on cisplatin- containing chemotherapy. .

4.1.2 Pembrolizumab Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Pharmacology 
Pembrolizumab binds to human and Cynomolgus monkey PD-[ADDRESS_828692] with dog, rat, or mouse PD-1. Pembrolizumab does not bind immunoglobulin superfamily members cluster of  differentiation 
28 (CD28), cytotoxic T -lymphoc yte-associated protein 4 (CTLA -4), or  inducible T -cell 
costimulator (ICOS).  
 Pembrolizumab strongly enhances T -lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells 
from healthy human donors, cancer subjects, and nonhuman primates. In T -cell activation 
assays using human donor blood cells, the half -maximal effective concentration (EC
50) has 
been approximately 0.1 to 0.3 nM. In addition to interleukin- 2 (IL -2), tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma (IFN γ), and levels of other cytokines were found to be 
modulated by [CONTACT_79911]. The antibody potentiates existing immune responses only in the presence of antigen and does not nonspecifically activate T -cells. In the in vitro peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and whole blood cytokine release  assays, the cytokine levels 
induced by [CONTACT_79912]. Pembrolizumab does not induce antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or 
complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).  
 Using anti–murin e PD -1 surrogate antibodies, PD -1 blockade has been shown to significantly 
inhibit tumor growth in a variety of syngeneic murine tumor models. In these experiments in mice, anti –PD-1 therapy is synergistic with chemotherapeutic agents such as gemcitabine and 
5-fluorouracil (5 -FU), and combination therapy results in increased complete tumor regression 
rates in vivo. Studies also revealed that immunosuppressive doses of dexamethasone included in combination with agents used in standard-of- care treatment for  
NSCLC do not reduce the anti- tumor efficacy of an anti –murine PD-1 surrogate antibody. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a non–
Good Laboratory 
Practices (GLP) single dose PK study and two GLP repeat -dose toxicokinetic (TK) studies (1 
month and 6 month) in Cynomolgus monkeys. Pembrolizumab stability as a modified IgG4 molecule was evaluated in vivo in mice.  
 After single -dose IV administration at 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg in Cynomolgus monkeys, decline of 
serum concentration followed multiphasic kinetics. Anti –drug antibodies (ADAs) were  
detected in most of the treated animals. Clearance (CL) and terminal half -life (t
1/2) appeared  to 
be dose-dependent in the dose range tested with t 1/2 varying from 4 to 10 days. In the 1 -month 
repeat -dose (once weekly) GLP toxicity study at 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg in Cynomolgus monkeys, 
ADAs were detected in most of the low -dose (6 mg/kg) treated animals. The systemic exposure 
over the 7- day dosing interval (AUC 0-7 days) was sex-independent and increased with increasing 
dose. The mean t 1/2 values in individual 
ADA-negative animals ranged from 15.7 to 22.3 days across doses.  In the 6-month repeat-dose (every other week) GLP toxicity study at 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg in 
 
Page [ADDRESS_828693] of the low -dose (6 mg/kg) treated  animals. 
The systemic exposure to pembrolizumab was independent of sex and was  approximately 
dose-proportional across all doses. The mean t 1/2 values in individual 
ADA- negative animals ranged from 21 to 22 days across doses. 
 
IgG4 wild type molecule can undergo in vivo molecular rearrangement called Fab- arm (or  
half molecule) exchange by [CONTACT_108653][INVESTIGATOR_108594]4 half molecules, thereby [CONTACT_108654]. Pembrolizumab is a hinge mutated IgG4 (S228P), which prevents in vivo half -molecule swap (formation of hybrid ). An in vivo mice  
experiment has demonstrated that pembrolizumab did not form hybrid antibody with another  
wild type IgG4 molecule.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Pharmacology/Toxicology 
The potential for systemic toxicity of pembrolizumab was assessed in a 1- month repeat -dose 
toxicity study with a 4 -month recovery in Cynomolgus monkeys and in a 6-month repeat -dose 
toxicity study with a 4 -month recovery period in Cynomolgus monkeys. In the 
1-month toxicity study, Cynomolgus monkeys were administered an IV dose of 6, 40, or  200 
mg/kg once weekly for a total of 5 doses. Four monkeys/sex/group were euthanized during Week 5. The remaining 2 monkeys/sex/group were euthanized during Week 23, after  a 4-
month post -dose period. In this study, pembrolizumab was well -tolerated in monkeys  with the  
systemic exposure (AUC) up to approximately 170,000 μg·day/mL over the course  of the 
study. There was no test art icle–related mortality, and test article –related changes  were limited 
to an increased incidence of inguinal swelling, and increased splenic weights in  males 
receiving 200 mg/kg. Both of these findings were not considered adverse and there  was no 
histopathologic correlation. Splenic weights were normal at the post- dose necropsy.  
 Anti–pembrolizumab antibodies were detected in 7 out of 8 animals in the 6 mg/kg dose  group 
and 1 animal out of 8 in the 40 mg/kg dose group and were associated with an apparent  increase 
in clearance of pembrolizumab. The presence of ADA in monkeys in the low -dose group and 
in [ADDRESS_828694] the pharmacodynamic response, because 
sufficient target engagement was demonstrated for the duration of the study  (with  the exception 
of 1 low -dose monkey). Additionally, anti –pembrolizumab antibodies were  not detected in any 
monkeys in the high- dose group, suggesting that potential toxicity has  been evaluated at the 
highest exposure levels in the study. Based on the  lack of adverse test  article –related findings 
in this study, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was ≥200 mg/kg.  
 In the 6 -month toxicity study, the potential for systemic toxicity was assessed in Cynomolgus 
monkeys administered an IV dose of 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg once every other week for  
approximately 6 months (a total of 12 doses) followed by a 4- month treatment- free period.  
Three animals/sex/group were designated for interim necropsy at the end of the 6 -month dosing 
phase ([ADDRESS_828695] dose in Study Week 23); and the remaining 
monkeys were designated for final necropsy following the 4-month treatment- free period.  
Pembrolizumab was well tolerated at all dose levels. There were no test article –related  ante 
mortem findings, electrocardiographic or ophthalmic findings, changes at injection sites, gross 
observations or organ weight changes at the interim or final necropsy. Because there  were no 
test article –related histomorphologic findings at interim necropsy, histomorphologic  
 
Page 25 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
evalu ation of tissues collected at final necropsy was not conducted. The presence of ADA  was 
observed in 5 out of 10 animals at 6 mg/kg/dose during the dosing phase, which correlated 
with an apparent increased rate of elimination of pembrolizumab in these anima ls. 
No anti –pembrolizumab antibodies were detected at 40 or 200 mg/kg/dose during the dosing 
phase, and no pembrolizumab serum concentration profiles in these [ADDRESS_828696] of ADA on pembrolizumab elimination rate. During the treatment- free period, anti– 
pembrolizumab antibodies were detected in 2 animals at the 6 mg/kg/dose, which already had ADA present during the dosing phase, and in 2 additional animals (1 at the 6 mg/kg/dose and 1 at the 200 mg/kg/dose), which were ADA-negative during the dosing phase. The detection of anti-pembrolizumab antibodies had a minimal effect on the mean group systemic exposure to pembrolizumab during the study and did not impact the evaluation of potential toxicity of pembrolizumab for the duration of the 6-month study, because there were no test article– related effects on any of the parameters examined and no monkey in the mid- and high-dose groups developed ADA during the dosing phase. In conclusion, pembrolizumab administered 
once every other week over a 6 -month duration to Cynomolgus monkeys was  well tolerated 
and the NOAEL was ≥200 mg/kg/dose (the highest dose tested).  
 In addition, tissue cross -reactivity studies using monkey and human specimens were  conducted 
to evaluate the potential cross reactivity of pembrolizumab with cryosections of Cynomolgus monkey tissues and normal human tissues. Results demonstrated the expected  
on-target staining of the membranes of mononuclear leukocytes in both species. The  off-target 
staining (cytoplasmic and stromal) that o ccurred in many tissues of both species  was 
considered spurious binding inherent to the experimental conditions of the in vitro tissue  cross -
reactivity studies with no in vivo toxicological significance.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Summary of Results 
As of the data cutoff dates for the IB (dated 17- FEB-2017) pembrolizumab monotherapy and 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622426] 9833 subjects with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors in [COMPANY_006] -sponsored trials  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profile of pembrolizumab, with low clearance and limited volume of distribution, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_422473]. Exposure to pembrolizumab is  approximately 
linear in the dose range of clinical relevance (1 to 10 mg/kg  and at 200mg ). Furthermore,  
pembrolizumab has a low potential of eliciting the formation of anti- drug antibodies. 
 
The pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab was studied in 2195 patients who received doses of 
1 to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Based on population 
pharmacokinetic analyses  in patients with solid tumors, the geometric mean [% coefficient of 
variation (CV%)] for clearance, steady  state volume of distribution, and terminal half -life were 
202 mL/day (37%), 7.38 L (19%) and 27 days  (38%), respectively.  
Steady -state concentrations of pembrolizumab were reached by 19 weeks of repeated dosing 
with an  every 3 -week regimen and the systemic accumulation was 2.2 -fold. The peak 
concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Cmin), and are a under the plasma concentration

the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety 
Pembrolizumab has a positive benefit- risk profile and is well tolera ted in the approved 
indications, as evidenced by a low rate of toxicity Grade 3 to 5 drug- related AEs (13.8%),  
discontinuations due to AEs (11.9%), and deaths due to drug-related AEs (0.4%). 
Furthermore, the frequency of immune-mediated AEOSIs is low, and these events are readily  
managed in the clinical setting. The safety and efficacy data generated to date provide a favorable benefit -risk assessment for the use of pembrolizumab as a treatment for subjects with 
advanced/metastatic melanoma, NSCLC, and HNSC C.  
In the pembrolizumab monotherapy trials (P001/P002, P012, P013, and P028, plus the P011 monotherapy arm), the overall incidence of AEs ranged from 83.0% (73 of 88 subjects in P012) to 100% (10 of 10 subjects in P011). The most commonly reported AEs inc luded fatigue, 
diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, and anemia. The incidence of drug - related  AEs (DRAEs) 
ranged from 39.8% (35 of 88 subjects in P013) to 80.0% (8 of 10 subj ects in  P011). The most 
commonly reported DRAEs across all studies were nausea, fatigue, and  diarrhea. The 
incidence of Grade 3 -5 DRAEs across studies ranged from 6.8% (6 of 88 in P013) to 12.0% 
(187 of 1562 subjects) in P001/P002. The most commonly reported Grade [ADDRESS_828697] 
subjects who experienced an AE continued in the study, with the incidence of AEs leading to 
discontinuation ranging from 1.9% (8 of 430 subjects in P028) to 12.3%  (192 of 1562 subjects 
in P001/P002). The majority of AEs leading to  discontinuation were not considered drug 
related. Discontinuations due to a DRAE were infrequent and ranged from 0% (no subjects in P011) to 4.5% (4 of 88 subjects in P013). The  most commonly reported DRAEs leading to 
discontinuation were pneumonitis, alanine  increased aminotransferase, and increased aspartate 
aminotransferase.  
 The overall pattern of AEs observed in melanoma subjects enrolled in P002 demonstrates  
favorable safety profile when this immune therapy is compared to chemotherapy. Cons istent  
with prior observations from randomized comparisons of the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose  levels 
when given every [ADDRESS_828698] a f avorable safety  profile 
compared to chemotherapy.  
 In the combination therapy trials (P021 and P023), the overall incidence of AEs was  95.4% 
(62 of 65 subjects) in P021 and 80% (8 of 10 subjects) in P023. In P021, the most  commonly 
reported AEs in this population across the dose regimens were fatigue (49.2%),  constipation 
and nausea (26.2% each), decreased appetite (23.1%), diarrhea (18.5%), and anemia and 
alopecia (15.4% each). In P023, the most commonly reported AEs experienced in this 
population across the dose regimens were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (50.0%  each), 
followed by [CONTACT_108659], respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], and back pain (30.0% each). The incidence of DRAEs was 86.2% (56 of 65 subjects in this population) in P021 and 60.0% (6 of 10 subjects in this population) in P023. In P021, the most commonly reported DRAEs experienced in this 
population across the dose regimens are fatigue (35.4%); nausea, decreased appetite, and 
alopecia (13.8% each); diarrhea (12.3%); and constipation and aspartate aminot ransferase 
increased (10.8% each). In P023, the most commonly reported DRAEs experienced in this 
 
Page 27 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
population across the dose regimens were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (50.0% each), 
anemia (30.0%), dysphonia, hiccups, and pruritis (20.0% each). 
 Grade 3 -5 DRAEs were reported in 23.1% (15 of 65 subjects in this population) in P021 and 
50.0% (5 of 10 subjects in this population) in P023. In P021, the most common Grade 3-5 DRAEs in this population across dose regimens were aspartate aminotransferase increas ed 
(6.2%) and anemia and alanine aminotransferase increased (4.6% each). In P023, the only  
Grade [ADDRESS_828699] in this population across dose  regimens 
were neutropenia (40.0%) and anemia (20.0%).  In P021, most subjects continued treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_108596], and only 4.6% discontinued due to an 
AE. Only 3.1% of subjects discontinued study treatment due to an AE that was  considered 
related to study treatment by [CONTACT_4718]. Adverse events resulting in  discontinuation were 
reported in 3.1% (2 of 65 subjects). Interstitial lung disease, dermatitis  allergic, and drug 
eruption were the only AEs resulting in discontinuation and were reported in [ADDRESS_828700] each 
(1.5%). In P023, no subjects discontinued due to an AE.  In general, the i ncidence of drug- related serious adverse events (DRSAEs) was low. Many  of 
the events occurred in [ADDRESS_828701] each and/or <1.0% each.  In the pembrolizumab monotherapy trials, the most commonly reported DRSAEs (those that  
occurred in [ADDRESS_828702] 1 study) were pneumonitis (range of 0.7% to  
1.3% of subjects); colitis (range of 0.3% to 0.9% of subjects), pyrexia (range of 0.3% to 0.5% of subjects); diarrhea (range of 0.2% to 0.4%); hepatitis (0.7% of subjects); nausea, adrenal  
insuffici ency, hyponatraemia, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, vomiting, and dyspnea  (0.3% of 
subjects each); and dehydration, generali zed edema, hypothyroidism, renal failure  acute, and 
pericardial effusion (0.2% of subjects each). The remaining DRSAEs occurred in [ADDRESS_828703] each. In P021, 8 subjects experienced DRSAEs; the DRSAEs were as follows: anemia, febrile neutropenia,  
atrial fibrillation, colitis, pyrexia, hypersens itivity, alanine aminotransferase increased,  
aspartate aminotransferase increased, drug eruption, rash, and urticaria. In P023, 2 subjects  
experienced DRSAEs; [ADDRESS_828704] (AEOSI ) was 16.1%. Overall, the most  commonly reported AEOSI included hypothyroidism 
(7.2% of subjects), pneumonitis  (2.9% of subjects), infusion reaction (2.5% of subjects), and 
hyperthyroidism (2.2% of subjects). The incidences of the remaining AEOSI were low (range of 0.1 to 1.3% of subjects). The overall incidence of drug-related AEOSI was 14.3%. Overall, 
 
Page 28 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
2.6% of  subjects discontinued treatment due to an AEOSI and the most commonly reported 
drug- related . 
 
AEOSI leading to discontinuation was pneumonitis (1.3% of subjects). Only one  subject died 
of AEOSI (pneumonitis, 0.1% of subjects). No corticosteroids were used to manage myositis, 
pericarditis, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, uveitis and vasculitis.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy: Melanoma  
The safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a randomized (1:1:1), open- label,  
multicenter, active -controlled trial in patients with  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naive melanoma Patients were 
randomized to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of  10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 10mg/kg every 
3 weeks as an intravenous infusion until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or to 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion for 4 doses  unless discontinued 
earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression could 
receive additional doses of treatment unless disease progression was symptomatic,  was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_622427], required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or  
was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_27939] (0 vs.1), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and PD -L1 expression (≥1% of tumor cells  [positive] vs. 
<1% of tumor cells  [negative]) according to an investigational use only (IUO) assay. Key 
eligibility criteria were unresectable  or metastatic melanoma with progression of disease; no 
prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; and no more than one prior  systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma. 
Patients with BRAF V600E mutation -positive melanoma  were not required to have received 
prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Patients with autoimmune disease; a  medical condition that 
required immunosuppression; previous severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal  antibodies; 
and HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, were ineligible. Assessment of tumor status was  
performed at 12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 12 weeks thereafter.  The major efficacy  outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression -
free survival (PFS ), as assessed by [CONTACT_19375] (BICR) using Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors [RECIST v1.1]). Additional efficacy outcome measures 
were overall response rate (ORR) and  response duration. 
A total of 834 patients were randomized: 277 patients to the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 
3 weeks arm,  279 to the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_828705] atistically significant improvements in OS and

The efficacy of pembrolizumab was investigated in a sub -group of a cohort of 280 patients 
enrolled in a  multicenter, open -label multi- cohort, activity -estimating study . The cohort 
consisted of patients  with metastatic NSCLC that had progressed following platinum -
containing chemotherapy, and if  appropriate, targeted therapy for ALK or EGFR mutations 
and any evidence of PD -L1 expression by a  clinical trial immunohistochemistry assay. Patients

with autoimmune di sease; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had 
received more than [ADDRESS_828706] for  PD-L1 expression tumor proportion score (TPS). This retrospectively 
identified sub- group of 61 patients  accounts for 22% of the 280 patients in the cohort. Patients 
included in this sub- group had a PD -L1 expression TPS of greater than or equal to 50% tumor 
cells as determined by [CONTACT_187284] -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx Kit. Patients received KEYTRUDA 10 
mg/kg every 2 (n=27) or 3 (n=34) weeks until  unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that 
was symptomatic, was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_10480], required  urgent interven tion, occurred with a 
decline in performance status, or was confirmed at [ADDRESS_828707] 1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_622446]. 
Among the 61 patients with a TPS greater than or equal to 50%, the baseline characteristics 
were:  
median age 60 years (34% age 65 or older); 61% male; 79% White; and 34% and 64% with an ECOG PS  0 and 1, respectively. Disease character istics were squamous (21%) and non-
squamous (75%); M1 (98%); brain metastases (11%); one (26%), two (30%), or three or more 
(44%) prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and the  incidence of genomic aberrations was EGFR (10%) or ALK 
(0%).  
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 2. The ORR and duration of response were similar regardless of  schedule (every 2 weeks or every 3 weeks) and thus the data below are pooled.

fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), basic FGF, hepatocycte growth factor (HGF), interleukin (IL)-8, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).   
Of the numerous molecules that have been shown to have angiogenic properties, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis with increased expression being associated with a poor prognosis in many human tumor types, including gastroesophageal cancers.  VEGF acts primarily on endothelial cells to promote their 

 
Page [ADDRESS_828709] on tumor growth and metastasis formation. 
Lenvatinib is an oral, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase  (RTK) inhibitor that selectively  inhibits 
the kinase activities of VEGF receptors VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3.  Lenvatinib also 
inhibits other receptor tyrosine kinases that have been implicated in  pathogenic angiogenesis, 
tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal  cellular functions. These 
include FGF receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; PDGFR α, KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib interacts with 
VEGFR2 with a novel binding mode recently  categorized as Type V resulting in high 
selectivity, rapid association kinetics and relatively  slow dissociation kinetics for the target.[ 1] 
Lenvatinib binds to the  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -binding site and the neighboring 
allosteric region in the kinase  domain adopti ng the aspartic acid -phenylalanine- glycine (DFG) -
in conformation. This  results in superior binding affinity of lenvatinib to VEGFR2. Most of 
the known receptor  tyrosine kinase inhibitors are categorized as: 1) Type I inhibitors which 
bind the kinase in the  DFG -in configuration and only bind to the ATP -binding site; or 2) Type 
II inhibitors which bind the kinase in the DFG -out conformation and bind to both the ATP -
binding site and the neighboring regions. 
 The results of in vitro receptor binding assays, cel l-based assays, and an in vivo angiogenesis  
models as well as the results of recent studies in human xenograft  models in athymic mice  
suggest that in most tumors, the mode of  action for lenvatinib antitumor activity is primarily  
related to the inhibition o f both VEGF  and FGF- dependent angiogenesis .[2, 3] Specifically,  
intracellular signal transduction analysis for  MAPK/Erk1/2, S6K, S6, and their  phosphorylated 
forms in HUVECs revealed that lenvatinib  inhibited the MAPK pathway and the mTOR -S6K-
S6 pathway triggered by [CONTACT_578166], both of which are important 
intracellular signaling pathways for  angiogenesis. Since cross talk between the VEGF 
signaling pathway and the FGF signalin g pathway may accelerate angiogenesis in the tumor, 
this mode of dual inhibition may more  effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis. In addition, 
recent data from preclinical studies  suggest that the FGFR pathway is also a driver resistance 
to antiangiogenic drugs .[4]  Lenvatinib targets both VEGFR- and FGFR -induced  
angiogenesis thereby [CONTACT_622447].  
Lenvatinib has been approved in the US for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine -refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).

 In cell -based assays, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF -driven VEGFR2 phosphorylation,  
proliferation, and tube formation in human umbilical  vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models 
with IC50 values of 0.25, 3.4, and 2.1 nmol/L, respectively. Lenvatinib also inhibited FGF -
driven HUVEC tube formation of with an IC50 value of 7.3 nmol/L. These results indicated that lenvatinib inhibits both VEGF - and FGF- driven angiogenesis in vitro.  
 In human tumor xenograft models in athymic mice, orally administered lenvatinib  
(administered as lenvatinib mesylate) significantly inhibited the growth of many different

[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics 
 The PK of lenvatinib in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys were characterized by a low plasma clearance and a small to moderate volume of distribution. After oral administration of  
lenvatinib at 3 mg/kg as a solution, lenvatinib was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_622428] (64.4%), rats (68.7%), dogs (70.4%), and monkeys (78.4%).  In vitro plasma protein binding of lenvatinib (0.3 – 30 μg/mL) was highest in humans (97.87% 
– 98.62%), followed by [CONTACT_116434], athymic mice, monkeys, and dogs. In humans, lenvatinib mainly bound to albumin. In vitro blood to plasma ratios of lenvatinib (0.1 - 10 μg/mL) remained 
constant in humans (0.589 – 0.608); in contrast, the ratios in animals were lower with 
increasing concentration.  
 In human liver microsomes, the demethylated form of lenvatinib was identified as the major metabolite. This metabolite was also detected after incubation with mouse, rat, dog, and monkey liver microsomes. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 was the predominant (>80%) CYP isoform involved in the metabolism of lenvatinib. Aldehyde oxidase (AO) in human liver 9000×g supernatant of homogenate (S9) generated M3´ from lenvatinib and M2´ from M2. About 50 metabolites were detected in plasma, tissues, urine, feces, and bile samples after a single oral administration of [14C]lenvatinib (radiolabeled on the quinoline ring) to rats and

monkeys at 3 mg/kg. More than 50% of methanol extractable radioactivity in plasma was 
parent drug, lenvatinib, and oxidative metabolism was one of the main metabolic pathways of lenvatinib. In addition to oxidative metabolism, glutathione (GSH) conjugation with elimination of the O -aryl group followed by [CONTACT_454517] (hydrolysis of the 
glutathione moiety, degradation of the cysteine moiety, and intramolecular rearrangement of the cysteinylglycine and cysteine conjugates and subsequent dimerization) were the major metabolic pathways a fter [14C]lenvatinib administration. Cleavage of the O -aryl bond

acetyl glucosamine with or without hydroxylation) were the major metabolic pathways after [14C]CB- lenvatinib (radiolabeled on the chlorobenzene ring). In human plasma, lenvatinib and 
its metabolite, the N -cysteine conjugate of the quinoline moiety in lenvatinib, could form 
covalent bonds with human plasma protein(s) via the thioether and disulfide bonds, respectively. Nucleophiles such as GSH and cysteine successfully released lenvatinib -related 
components which covalently bound to human plasma protein as the corresponding conjugates via a substitution reaction, suggesting that the covalent binding would be reversible in humans in vivo.  After a single oral administration of [14C]lenvatinib (3 mg/kg) to rats and monkeys, radioactivity was mainly excreted in feces, and 90% or more of the radioactive dose was recovered by [ADDRESS_828710] 65%, which 
coincided with oral bioavailability of lenvatinib. Tissue distribution and elimination of radioactivity in most tissues were parallel with that in blood or plasma in rats and monkeys, while the elimination of  radioactivity in the melanin -containing tissues was slow in monkeys. 
 The placental transfer of lenvatinib after a single oral administration of [14C]lenvatinib (3 mg/kg) to pregnant rats was very low in rats on Days 13 and 18 of pregnancy. The radioactivity in milk was approximately 2 times higher than that in plasma after a single oral administration of [14C]lenvatinib mes ylate to lactating rats (3 mg/kg), and the radioactivity in the milk 
decreased in parallel with that in plasma. Radioactivity detected  in the milk and plasma was 
primarily attributed to the parent drug, lenvatinib.  
 Lenvatinib exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 (IC50: 10.1 μmol/L), a weak inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A and virtually no  inhibitory effect on CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 in human liver microsomes. Time -
dependent inhibition by [CONTACT_622448] 1'- hydroxymidazolam from midazolam 
(CYP3A4) was observed. The results of the simulations using Simcyp® suggested that there is no significant drug -drug interaction risk between lenvatinib and midazolam (CYP3A 
substrate) or repaglinide (CYP2C8 substrate) at the clinical dose of 24 mg of lenvatinib.  Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 3 μmol/L of lenvatinib had a tende ncy 
towards a slight increase in CYP3A enzyme activity or CYP3A4 mRNA expression. No effects on CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2B6 based on enzyme activities or messenger (mRNA) expression.  
 In human liver microsomes, lenvatinib directly inhibited 5´ -diphospho-
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1 and UGT1A4 with IC50 values of 10.6 and 14.0 μmol/L, 
 
Page [ADDRESS_828711] inhibition of UGT1A6, 
UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 (IC50 values greater than 30.0 μmol/L). Treatment of culture d human 
hepatocytes with up to 3 μmol/L of lenvatinib did not induce UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 enzyme activities or mRNA expression.  Lenvatinib was a substrate for multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1, = P -glycoprotein [ P-gp]) 
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and showed inhibitory activity toward P -gp-
mediated and BCRP -mediated transports (IC50>30 μmol/L). Lenvatinib was not a substrate 
for organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1,  OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT)1, OCT2, or bile salt export pump 
(BSEP). Lenvatinib showed an inhibitory effect on OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, and BSEP with the IC50 values of 4 to 15 μmol/L, and no inhibitory effect on OATP1B3 (IC50 >30 μmol/L). Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 3 μmol/L of lenvatinib showed no induction potency on P -gp mRNA expression. In human liver cytosol, lenvatinib 
did not inhibit AO activity (IC50 >100 μmol/L).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Pharmacology/Toxicology 
In the chronic toxicity studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, target organ toxicity was primarily observed in the kidneys (glomerulopathy, sometimes with proteinuria), gastrointestinal tract (duodenal lesions), artery/arterioles (arterial fibrinoid necr osis, medial 
degeneration, or hemorrhage) in various organs, bone (increased epi[INVESTIGATOR_622429]/cartilage), and male and female reproductive organs (testicular hypocellularity and  
ovarian follicular atresia and decreased menstruation [monkeys]) in both species, and in the incisor (dysplasia) and adrenals (sinusoidal dilatation, cortical necrosis) in rats. All of these findings were not unexpected as similar findings have been reported in animals treated with other TKIs and are considered to be related to the pharmacologic (antiangiogenic) effects of  
lenvatinib. These findings were reversible and most were not evident at the end of the 4- week recovery period.  The effects of lenvatinib on the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and central nervous system (CNS)  
were evaluated in rats and dogs. Two in vitro electrophysiology studies were also conducted to assess the effect of lenvatinib on human ether -à-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium 
current or action potential parameters. No significant adverse effects were observed in these 
studies except for a weak inhibitory effect on hERG potassium current (IC50 = 11.89 μmol/L).  In view of these results, lenvatinib is anticipated to have a low risk of cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and CNS adverse effects in humans. However, hypertension is an identified clinical risk associated with clinical use of lenvatinib and other VEGF inhibitors . 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Summary of Results

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacology 
Data from the clinical pharmacology studies showed lenvatinib: 
• Exhibits linear PK and minimal accumulation at clinically relevant doses  
• Is extensively metab olized with no major metabolites  
• Has an elimination half -life of approximately 28 hours 
• Has no clinically significant drug-drug interactions • Has no food effect • Does not prolong QTc interval in healthy volunteers (increases >10 msec excluded) 
 
Absorption: A

typi[INVESTIGATOR_197362] [ADDRESS_828713] the 
extent of absorption, but decreases the rate of absorption and delays t he median Tmax from 2 
hours to 4 hours.  
 I
n patients with solid tumors administered single and multiple doses of lenvatinib once daily, 
the maximum lenvatinib plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration - 
time curve (AUC) increased pro portionally over the dose range of 3.2 to 32 mg with a median 
accumulation index of 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg).   Distribution: I
 n vitro binding of lenvatinib to human plasma proteins ranged from 98% to 99% 
(0.3 – 30 μg/mL). In vitro, the lenvatinib blood- to-plasma concentration ratio ranged from 
0.589 to 0.608 (0.1 – 10 μg/mL).  
 B
ased on in vitro data, lenvatinib is a substrate of P -gp and BCRP but not a substrate for 
organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP ) 
1B1, OATP1B3, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, or the bile salt export pump (BSEP).  
 Elimination: P
 lasma concentrations declined bi -exponentially following Cmax. The terminal 
elimination half -life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours. 
 Metabolism: C
 YP3A is one of the main metabolic enzymes of lenvatinib. The main metabolic 
pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic (CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase) and non- enzymatic processes.  
 
Excretion:  Ten days after a single administratio n of radiolabeled lenvatinib to 6 patients with 
solid tumors, approximately 64% and 25% of the radiolabel were eliminated in the feces and urine, respectively. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Saf
ety 
 
Safety data obtained in [ADDRESS_828714] common adverse reactions observed in lenvatinib -treated patients (greater than or 
equal to 30%) were, in order of decreasing frequency, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, 
arthralgia/myalgia, decreased appetite, weight decreased, nausea, stomatitis, headache, vomiting, proteinuria, palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia  (PPE) syndrome, abdominal pain, 
and dysphonia. The most common serious adverse reactions (at least 2%) were pneumonia (4%), hypertension (3%), and dehydration (3%).  Adverse reactions led to dose reductions in 68% of patients receiving lenvatinib  and 5% of 
patients receiving placebo; 18% of patients discontinued lenvatinib  and 5% discontinued 
placebo for adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions (at least 10%) resulting in dose reductions of lenvatinib were hypertension (13%), proteinuria (11%),  decreased appetite 
(10%), and diarrhea (10%); the most common adverse reactions (at least 1%) resulting in discontinuation of lenvatinib  were hypertension (1%) and asthenia (1%) 
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Efficacy  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Phase I /Ib studies 
There were a total of 34 confirmed PRs observed in four studies across all doses as of the cutoff date of 27 Apr 2014, including 7 (20.6%) in Study E7080 -E044- 101, 10 (29.4%) in Study 
E7080-A001- 102 (Schedules 1 and 2), 1 (2.9%) in Study E7080-J081- 103, and 16 (47.1%) in 
Study E7080-J081-110. One CR was observed in Study E7080-J081-110.  
Study E7080-J081- 110 is completed. Objective response rate (ORR [CR + PR]) was 60.7% 
(17 of 28 subjects) overall, 68.2% (15 of 22 subjects) in the combined 4 mg BID group (dose-
escalation cohort and expansion cohort combined), and 33.3% (2 of 6 subjects) in the 6 mg BID group.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Phase II studies 
There were a total of 13 Phase 2 studies: 7 are completed, 5 are ongoing, and 1 was closed to enrollment. Of the 7 completed studies, 2 were conducted in subjects with melanoma  (E7080-
G000-206, E7080-702), one was in DTC and medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) (E7080-G000-
201), one in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma  (HCC)  (E7080-J081- 202), one in recurrent 
Grade 3 or 4 GBM (glioblastoma, malignant) (E7080-G000- 203), and one in advanced 
endometrial cancer (E7080-G000-204), and one in ATC or DTC or MTC (E7080-J081-208]). Study E7080- [ADDRESS_828715] with Grade 4 GBM. PFS and OS results showed no difference in these outcomes between recurrent Grade 4 GBM subjects treated with lenvatinib and those treated with bevacizumab (Cohort 1). Although OS rates at 12 and 18 months were numerically higher in the lenvatinib than in the bevacizumab arm (lenvatinib 37% and 24% vs bevacizumab 22% and 9%), in the context of a PFS -6 of 21.2%, median OS of only 7.5 months 
 
Page 38 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
for lenvatinib, and the difference in median OS of only 1.5 months between lenvatinib and 
bevacizumab, the DMC and Eisai concurred that lenvatinib does not provide additional benefit over bevacizumab in these subjects. The activity of lenvatinib wa s limited in subjects with 
recurrent Grade 3 GBM (Cohort 2), with a 6- month PFS rate of 8.0%, median PFS of 2.8 
months, and median OS of 12.0 months (median 17.7 months of follow -up). The activity of 
lenvatinib was unimpressive in subjects with recurrent Grade 4 GBM who failed prior bevacizumab therapy (Cohort 3), with a 6- month PFS rate of 7.6%, median PFS of 1.8 months, 
and median OS of 4.1 months (median 23.4 months of follow-up) in these subjects. 
In Study E7080-G000-204, treatment with lenvatinib resul ted in antitumor activity in subjects 
with recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer with evidence of disease progression following 
platinum- based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was the ORR; 19 (14.3%) 
subjects achieved a best overall respon se of CR ([ADDRESS_828716]) or PR (18 subjects) based on the 
assessments by [CONTACT_622449] (IRR), and 28 (21.1%) subjects achieved CR (2 subjects) or PR (26 subjects) based on investigator assessments in the Full Analyses Set. Results from the Per Protocol Analysis Set were similar, with an ORR of 15.7% (19 subjects) 
based on the assessments by [CONTACT_622450] 22.3% (27 subjects) based on investigator assessments, indicating that lenvatinib is active as a second -line treatment in subjects with 
advan ced endometrial cancer. Median OS was 9.6 months (median follow -up was 9.6 months). 
The median OS increased to 10.6 months based on an updated survival assessment at 59.4% of events and a median follow -up at 15.[ADDRESS_828717] approximately 6 mont hs later. 
The median estimate of PFS was 5.6 months based on IRR assessment. The 3- and 6 -month 
PFS rates were 66.1% and 41.0%, respectively, based on IRR assessment. 
Study E7080-G000- 206 primary objective was to assess the objective response rate (ORR; 
complete response + partial response [CR + PR]) of lenvatinib in subjects with unresectable 
Stage III or Stage IV melanoma not harboring the V600E BRAF mutation and disease 
progression following up to 2 prior systemic anticancer regimens for unresectable Sta ge III or 
Stage IV melanoma (Cohort 1) and in in subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma harboring the activating BRAF mutations (mainly the V600E mutation) and disease progression following BRAF V600E -targeted therapy (Cohort 2). The ORR  was similar for 
both subjects with or without the V600 E BRAF mutation. The ORR was 8.6% (8 subjects) in Cohort 1 and 9.0% (8 subjects) in Cohort 2. All were partial responses. Treatment with lenvatinib resulted in some antitumor activity in subjects with  unresectable Stage III or Stage 
IV melanoma and evidence of disease progression. For the Cohort 1 the median estimate of PFS was 3.7 month and the 6- month PFS rate was 26.1%. The estimated Kaplan- Meier median 
OS was 8.9 months. The overall survival rate was 40.9% at 12 months and was not estimable at 18 and 24 months. The median follow -up time was 8.7 months. Based on assessments by 
[CONTACT_453309], the disease control rate (DCR) was 52.7% and the CBR was 31.2%. The durable S D 
rate was 22.6%. The assessments for time to response and duration of response were not reliable given the small number of responses. For the Cohort 2 the median estimate of PFS was 1.8 months and the 6- month PFS rate was 17.2%. The estimated Kaplan -Meier median OS was 
6.3 months. The overall survival rate was 26.8% at 12 months, 19.9% at 18 months and 16.4% at 24 months. The median follow -up time was 14.0 months. Based on assessments by [CONTACT_453309], 
the DCR was 34.8% and the CBR was 14.6%. The durable SD rate was 5.6%. The assessments for time to response and duration of response were not reliable given the small number of 
responses.

 Clinical Research Protocol  
In Study E7080- 701, 7 subjects with platinum -sensitive ovarian cancer were enrolled. Due to 
the early termination of the study, no efficacy analysis was performed. 
Although efficacy was not an endpoint for the Phase 1b portion of Study E7080- 702, tumor 
response was recorded. The data presented were from local reads only; thus, caution should be 
used when interpreting the data. Some encouraging clinical activity was noted at the MTD (Cohort 2, 20 mg daily, n=7), with a best overall response of partial response (PR) for 2 subjects, stable disease (SD) for [ADDRESS_828718]. 
Although Study E7080- 702 was not powered or designed to determine superiority of the 
lenvatinib plus dacarbazine combination (L+D arm) compared with dacarbazine alone (D arm) 
in Phase 2, the study did provide promising efficacy results. The median PFS (imputed) for the L+D arm was 19.1 weeks (95% CI: 9.57, 25.57) compared with 7.0 weeks (95% CI: 5.57, 
15.57) for the D arm, with a hazard ratio of L+D versus D alone of 0.4 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.75), a 2.7-fold increase in PFS, and 60% reduction in progression risk. Time to progression favored 
the L+D arm (n=30), with an imputed median TTP  of 19.1 weeks (95% CI: 9.57, 24.43) 
compared with 7.0 weeks (95% CI: 5.57, 15.57) in the D arm (n=30), with a hazard ratio of L+D versus D alone of 0.4 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.79). In the L+D arm, 31 subjects (77.5%; 95% CI: 64.6%, 90.4%) were recorded as having PD or death at six months compared with 34 subjects (91.9%; 95% CI: 83.1%, 100.0%) in the D arm. An overall response (confirmed CR or PR) was reported for eight subjects (ORR: 20.0%; 95% CI: 7.6%, 32.4%) in the L+D arm compared with three subjects (ORR: 8 .1%; 95% CI: 0.0%, 16.9%) in the D arm for an ORR difference 
comparing the L+D arm with the D arm of 11.9% (95% CI: - 3.3%, 27.1%). In the L+D arm, 
the disease control rate (CR + PR + SD [confirmation of CR or PR not required]) was 60.0% (95% CI: 44.8%, 75.2%) compared with 40.5% (95% CI: 24.7%, 56.4%) in the D arm. 
A meaningful clinical benefit was observed in Study E7080-G000- 201. Lenvatinib showed 
antitumor activity in both the DTC and MTC histological cohorts. The primary endpoint of the 
study, ORR based on the assessments by [CONTACT_622451] (IIR), was 50% in 
the DTC cohort and 36% in the MTC cohort. A favorable benefit was also observed in the secondary efficacy endpoints of median PFS and overall survival. For the DTC cohort, with a 
follo w-up time of 14 months, the median estimate of PFS was 12.6 months, and for the MTC 
cohort, with a follow-up time of 8.0 months, the median estimate of PFS was 9.0 months. The overall survival rate was 86% for the DTC cohort and 76% for the MTC cohort at [ADDRESS_828719] led to pursuing a Phase 3 study, E7080- G000 -303, in subjects 
with 131I -refractory DTC and radiographic evidence of disease progression within the prior 
12 months. 
The remaining 6 Phase 2 studies, (E7080-G000- 205 in re nal cell carcinoma ( RCC) , E7080-
G000- 207 in pediatrics subjects, E7080-G000- 209 in adenocarcinoma, E7080- 703 in locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and E7050- G000 -901 in combination with lenvatinib in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors (Dose Escalation)  and in subjects with recurrent 
glioblastoma or unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma) are currently ong oing.

been analyzed for the primary objective of efficacy. This is a Phase 3 study to compare the 
 
Page 40 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in subjects with 131I -refractory DTC and radiographic 
evidence of disease progression within the prior 12 months. The study cutoff date for the 
primary analysis of this study was 15 Nov 2013. As of this date, 94 (36.0%) subjects in the 
lenvatinib arm and 119 (90.8%) subjects in the placebo arm had completed treatment in the Randomized Phase, i.e. , had disease progression. Treatment was discontinued prematurely for  
45 (17.2%) subjects in the lenvatinib arm and 4 (3.1%) subjects in the placebo arm. The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation in both treatment arms was AEs: 37 (14.2%) subjects in the lenvatinib arm and 3 (2.3%) subjects in the placebo arm. Treatment was ongoing for 122 (46.7%) lenvatinib subjects compared with 8 (6.1%) placebo subjects. 
All 392 subjects enrolled in the study (261 in the lenvatinib arm and 131 in the placebo arm) 
were included in both the Full Analysis Set and the Safety Analysis Set. The Per Protocol Analysis Set comprised 383/392 (97.7%) subjects, 256/261 (98.1%) subjects in the lenvatinib arm and 127/131 (96.9%) subjects in the placebo arm. 
Based on IIR assessments using the Full Analysis Set, the median PFS was 18.3 months  for 
lenvatinib compared with 3.6 months for the placebo group, with an HR of 0.21 (99% CI: 0.14, 
0.31), as estimated from the stratified Cox proportional hazard model. The difference in PFS between the lenvatinib and placebo arms was statistically significant (P<0.0001) using both a stratified and unstratified log -rank test.  
The results of the primary efficacy analysis were fully supported by [CONTACT_622452]. The median PFS and 95% CI were the same for the 2 analysis sets. The results of the 3 planned sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary 
PFS analyses (Sensitivity Analysis A [all events and deaths], Sensitivity Analysis B [investigators’ assessments], and Sensitivity Analysis C [uniform scheduled date of assessment]). The log -rank tests all showed a statistically significant difference between 
lenvatinib treatment and placebo (P<0.0001). The HRs for all the analyses were comparable (0.21 to 0.24). 
The median PFS was longer with lenvatinib treatme nt compared with placebo for all of the 
subgroups evaluated (age group [≤65, >65 years], sex, race, prior VEGF/VEGFR -targeted  
therapy [0, 1], region [Europe, North America, Other], histology [papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], follicular], and 
TSH level). The HRs and 2- sided 95% CIs showed favorable outcomes for lenvatinib 
compared with placebo for PFS for all the various subgroups. 
Four (1.5%) subjects treated with lenvatinib had a best overall response (BOR) of CR while 
no subjects in the placebo group had a CR, and 165 (63.2%) subjects had a PR compared with 2 (1.5%) subjects in the placebo group. The secondary endpoint, ORR based on the IIR assessments, was significantly higher with lenvatinib treatment. The ORR was 64.8% in the lenvatinib arm compared with 1.5% in the placebo arm. The odds ratio was 28.87, which was statistically significant (P<0.0001) in favor of lenvatinib. The median duration of objective response for the lenvatinib arm was not yet reached at the time of data cutoff. Among the responders, 75% had a duration of response of greater than 9.[ADDRESS_828721] objective response was 2.0 months for the lenvatinib group.

 Clinical Research Protocol  
Although OS was another secondary endpoint, the study was not designed to demonstrate a 
survival difference with the crossover design and limited statistical power. The analysis for OS included data from the placebo- treated subjects with confirmed disease progression who 
entered into the optional open label ( OOL ) Lenvatinib Treatment Period of the Extension 
Phase. At the data cutoff date, the median OS was not yet reached for either the lenvatinib arm or the placebo arm (including crossover subjects). When adjusted for the treatment crossover, using the pre -specified  rank-preserving structural failure time ( RPSFT ) model, the HR  was 
0.62 (95% CI: 0.40, 1.00), showing a trend toward prolongation of OS with lenvatinib as compared with placebo. The difference in OS between the 2 treatment arms was marginally significant as determined using the resampling method (bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) (P=0.0510). The adjusted OS rates were numerically higher in the lenvatinib arm compared with the placebo crossover arm (6 months: 90.7% vs 85.3%, respectively; 12 months: 81.6% vs 70.0%, respectively; 18 months: 72.3% vs 63.0%, respectively). Using the unadjus ted stratified Cox 
proportional hazard model, the HR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.07), showing a trend in favor of lenvatinib treatment for prolonged OS, as was observed with the adjusted model. 
Study E7080-G000- [ADDRESS_828722] Population  
[IP_ADDRESS] Background: Gastroesophageal Cancer 
With an annual global incidence of more than 952,000 cases of gastric cancer  (GC) and 
456,000 cases of esophageal cancer (EC), upper GI malignancies are major worldwide cancer risks. [5]  In the [LOCATION_002], predictions for 2015 call for 16,910 new cases of EC, with 
15,690 deaths, and 26,37 0 new cases of GC, with 10,730 deaths.[ 6]  Most patients diagnosed 
in the US unfortunately already have advanced incurable disease at the time of  presentation.  
Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine and platinum is typi[INVESTIGATOR_622430]-line treatment for advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, with median survival 
ranging from [ADDRESS_828723] supportive care, with median overall survival rates of 4- 5 months.[ 7]  
There is a clear need for better treatment options in this refractory gastroesophageal cancer patient population.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Targeting Angiogenesis 
Angiogenesis plays a major role in the development and progres sion of gastric cancer.  It has 
been shown that expression of VEGFR2 is a prognostic factor correlated with poor prognosis.[ 8]  Furthermore, the Gastric Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) has 
demonstrated how some subtypes of gastric cancer are associated with a recurrent amplification of the VEGF -A gene and with an elevated expression of t he an giogenesis -related 
pathways.[ 9-11] 
 
Page 42 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
Clinically, angiogenesis inhibitors are active and beneficial in the treatment of advanced gastric 
cancer.  A recent meta- analysis of 22 trials  exploring targeted therapy for a total of 7,022 
advanced gastric cancer patients demonstrated positive results for anti -angiogenic agents in 
terms of overall survival (HR 0.759; P < 0.001).[ 12]  Ramucirumab, an anti -VEGFR2 
monoclonal antibody, has been FDA approved as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel for treatment of advanced gastric or gastro -esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, 
with disease progression on or after prior fluoropyrimidine - or platinum -containing 
chemotherapy.  When used as a single agent median overall survival reached 5.2 months and in combination with paclitaxel 9.6 months. [13, 14]  In addition, apatinib an oral VEGFR2 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor was approved in China in December [ADDRESS_828724] failed two prior lines of chemotherapy, based on a survival benefit of nearly two months.[ 15]  It is currently being investigated in multiple additional ongoing studies in 
China including earlier lines of therapy, in combination with chemotherapy and as a maintenance strategy. [16]  Finally, regorafenib an oral multi -targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
including VEGFR1- 3, has demonstrated promising activity in refractory  gastroesophageal 
patients.  Led by [CONTACT_622453], INTEGRATE was a randomized phase II study of regorafenib versus placebo in 152 advanced gastroesophageal cancer patients who had progressed on one or more lines of prior therapy.  A significant improvement in progression free survival compared to placebo (2.6 vs 0.9 months, p<0.0001) was found in all geographic regions and patient subgroups evaluated.[ 17]   
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Checkpoint Inhibition 
There is increasing evidence that cancer immunotherapy is active in a wide variety of malignancies.  Modulation of the immune checkpoint is one of the key mechanisms by [CONTACT_622454].  Checkpoint pathways are regulated by [CONTACT_177735]/receptor interactions.  The programmed death -1 (PD -1) receptor is 
present on lymphocytes and negatively regulates T cell responses following binding of PD -1 
ligand (PD -L1), which is frequently expressed on tumor cells.  Blocking the PD -1/PD- L1 
interaction p revents tumors from down regulating the cytotoxic lymphocyte response.  Immune 
checkpoint inhibition has shown early promise in the treatment of gastric cancer.  A phase 1b study of single agent pembrolizumab was reported in which patients with advanced PD-L1-
positive gastric cancer who had progressed on at least 1 line of therapy were treated every 2 
weeks until progression or toxicity.  Pembrolizumab had manageable toxicity and demonstrated promising efficacy with a 22% response rate and a 12 month overall survival of 42%. [18]  Single agent pembrolizumab was subsequently evaluated in a large phase II study 
of patients with  advanced gastric/GEJ  adenocarcinoma who had progressed on 2 or more prior 
chemotherapy regimens.  Of 259 patients enrolled, overall response rate irrespective of tumor PD-L1 expression was 11.2% .[19] Grade 3 -5 treatment -related adverse events were 
manageable and occurred in 16.6% of patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in 2 patients and fatalities in 2 patients.  Nivolumab, a similar  monoclonal antibody targeting PD -
1, was investigated as a single agent in 59 refractory gastroesophageal cancer patients.  Overall 
response rate was 1 2%, with a 12 month overall survival rate of  38%. [20]  Single agent 
nivolumab was also evaluated in a randomized placebo controlled phase III study for patients with advanced gastric cancer who had progressed on 2 or more chemotherapy regimens.  A total of 493 patients were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to nivolumab versus placebo with 
primary endpoint overall survival.  Median OS was 5.32 months with nivolumab versus 4.14

 Clinical Research Protocol  
months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.78; 
p<0.0001), and OS rates at 6 and 12 month were 46.4% versus 34.7% and 26.6% versus 10.9%, respectively .  The overall response rate (ORR) was 11.2% (95% CI, 7.7- 15.6) with nivolumab 
versus 0% (95% CI, 0.0- 2.8) with placebo (p<0.0001). Grade ≥ 3 drug -related adverse events 
(AEs) occurred in 11.5 % of nivolumab and 5.5 % of placebo; 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively, discontinued of study treatment due to drug- related AEs (any grade). [21] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for a Combined Anti-Angiogenesis and Immune Therapy Strategy 
There is significant interplay between angiogenesis and the immune system.  VEGF has been shown to exert multiple effects on the anti -tumor immune response including antigen 
presentatio n, effector mechanisms and immune cell trafficking.  Specifically, VEGF can 
impair dendritic cell maturation through both VEGFR -1 and 2.[ 22-24]   VEGF can also induce 
myeloid derived suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation in a VEGFR2 dependent manner.[ 25, 26]  In addition, the extravasation of 
effector immune cells into tumor sites is modulated by [CONTACT_12270].   VEGF can down- regulate the 
expression of adhesion molecules, including ICAM 1 and VCAM -1, on tumor endothelial cells 
thereby [CONTACT_622455] -endothelial interaction. [24]  As a result, in the presence of a 
pro-angiogenic environment, the tumor microenvironment lacks adequate effector T cell 
infiltration and is characterized by [CONTACT_622456], conditions known to foster immunosuppressive cells.  In turn, many of the induced immunosuppressive cells themselves promote angiogenesis.  Both myeloid derived suppressor cells as well as activated dendritic cells directly support tumor neo -angiogenesis. [27-29]  
Given the extensive  cross talk between angiogenesis and immune surveillance, a combined 
and targeted approach is warranted for optimal outcomes.  Employing anti -angiogenic therapy 
provides several advantages beyond its own potential anti -tumor effects.   Because 
angiogenesis  inhibitors do not deplete all Tregs, but only restore their proportion to physiologic 
levels, there is less likelihood of autoimmune mediated side effects. [26] In addition, targeting 
angiogenesis does not deplete activated T cells while it does inhibit immunosuppr essive 
pathways such as MDSC’s and thereby [CONTACT_622457]-tumor response.[ 30]    
Proof of principle was demonstrated in a xenograft colon cancer model in which the simultaneous blockade of PD1 and VEGFR2 inhibited tumor growth synergistically, wi thout 
any overt toxicities. [31]  It was noted that VEGFR2 blockade did not interfere with T cell 
infiltration and immunological activation induced by [CONTACT_4002] -1 blockade.  In this study, a 
monoclonal antibody to VEGFR2 was employed; however, it is hypothesized that a VEGFR2 TKI with additional targets would be superior.  Sunitinib, a m ulti-targeted TKI with targets 
including VEGFR2, PDGFR and Flt3, demonstrated reversal of immune suppression and modulation of the tumor microenvironment in a colon xenograft model.[ 32]   There was a 
decrease in the number of MDSC’s and Tregs as well as an increase in CD8 and CD4 tumor infiltrating cells for sunitinib treated mice. There was also a decrease in expression of 
immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL -10 and TGF -β.  Promising activity for combined PD -
1 and VEGFR2 blockade has been seen in renal cell carcinoma.  In a phase I clinical trial 
combining nivolumab, an anti -PD-1 antibody with sunitinib or pazopanib in pati ents with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma the ORR was 52% (17/33) in the sunitinib arm and 45% (9/20) 
 
Page [ADDRESS_828725] assessment (6 w eeks) in 41% (arm S) and 
56% (arm P) of responding patients and were durable (range: arm  S: 12.1+ to 54 w eeks; arm 
P: 12.1 to 69.1+ w eeks).[33] 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Advantage of Lenvatinib in Gastroesophageal Cancer 
Similar to other anti -angiogenic agents found to have single agent activity in advanced 
gastroesophageal cancer, lenvatinib inhibits VEGFR2 with a high affinity and an IC 50 of 
4nM/L.  However, lenvatinib also targets additional tyrosine kinases including FGFR.   Fibroblas t growth factor (FGF) family members are among those linked to escape from the 
effects of inhibition of VEGF signaling .[34, 35]  Therefore, lenvatinib should theoretically 
provide superior anti -angiogenic activity than pure VEGF/VEFR2 inhibitors.  In mice models, 
lenvatinib was shown to inhibit both VEGF - and FGF - induced angiogenesis.[ 2]   Amongst an 
extended panel of 19 human tumor xenograft models, lenvatinib treatment resulted in significant tumor shrinkage with a ΔT/C of -55% in the AZ -521 gastric adenocarcinoma cell 
line.  The anti -tumor activity of lenvatinib in these xenografts was associated with high 
microvessel density (MVD) and low % of pericyte coverage.  Furthermore, when MVD and pericyte coverage were examined in [ADDRESS_828726] vascular scores and therefore would be predicted to be sensitive to treatment with lenvatinib. [2]  Additionally, alterations in FGFR2 
have been shown in up to 9% of gastric cancer patients and are correlated with poor outcome.[ 9, 36]  Lenvatinib may be especially beneficial in this subset.  Finally, it is interesting 
to note that both VEGFA and FGFR2 alterations are enriched in the chromosomal instability (CIN) and genomically stable (GS) molecular subsets defined by [CONTACT_97651]. [9]   More than 
two thirds of gastric cancers can be classified within these two subtypes which, unlike MSI and EBV subtypes, are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_622431] “immunogenic” tumors.  Using lenvatinib to simultaneously target VEGF and FGF in these common subtypes is hypothesized to improve their “immunogenicity” and response to PD-1 blockade.   
 
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection   
[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizmuab F ixed Dosing 
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) wa s conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent pembrolizumab.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated 
three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -
limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of pembrolizumab  showed 
evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical 
 
Page 45 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
studies within the pembrolizumab program has shown that a lower dose of pembrolizumab and 
a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed sl ow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic 
data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  
This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scient ific rationale for testing a Q2W and 
Q3W dosing schedule.    A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_828727] a wide therapeutic 
range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to  remain well 
within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab  in the melanoma 
indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg  Q3W (i.e. 5- fold higher 
dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no antic ipated changes in exposure between 
different indication settings.  
 The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships 
of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated  and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Combined Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib Dosing 
 
Page 46 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
An open label phase 1b/2 t rial of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in subjects with selected solid 
tumors ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is currently ongoing.  The phase 1b portion was designed to determine 
and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for lenvatinib in combination with 200 mg 
(intravenous [IV], every 3 weeks [Q3W]) pembrolizumab in participants with selected solid tumors including non- small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer,  
urothelial cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of  the head and neck, or melanoma . Based on the 
preliminary results from this study, the MTD for lenvatinib was determined to be 20mg PO daily.  In the first do sing cohort of lenvatinib 24mg po daily in combination with 
pembrolizumab 200mg IV q3w, 2 DLT’s occurred including 1 grade 3 fatigue and 1 grade 3 arthralgia.  As a result , the dose was de -escalated to 20mg of daily lenvatinib.  At this dose 
level, no DLT’s have been observed in 10 patients (6 with renal ce ll carcinoma, 2 with 
endometrial carcinoma, 1 with NSCLC and 1 with melanoma).  Seven of the ten patients have not experienced any significant adverse events, have not required any dose reductions, and remain on study (range 4 -19 weeks).  Three patients di d experience adverse events including 
one patient with grade 3 liver function abnormality at week 7 who came off study for progression of disease at week 9, one with grade 3 rhabdomyolysis at week 5 which resolved with holding treatment and patient currently continues on dose reduced treatment at week 9, and one patient with grade 3 hypertension at week 4.  The study has now proceeded  to the 
phase 2 expansion portion to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination in 6 cohorts with lenvatinib 20mg PO daily and pembrolizumab 200mg IV q3w. 
 
4.2.3 Rationale for Study Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary and Secondary Efficacy Assessments  
Objective response as assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_828728] measures of clinical activity. 
Overall survival is considered the  “gold standard” for  quantifying clinical benefit, with PFS 
being an acceptable surrogate.  
Safety  
Standard safety parameters (AEs, SAEs, laboratory evaluations, vital signs,  and  physical 
examinations) will be employed to assess the safety profile of lenva tinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research  
Candidate biomarkers for subject selection will be assessed to determine whether these 
markers predict which subjects are most likely to respond to treatment with lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab. 
Tumors can express PD -L1 as a mechanism of adaptive resistance to an activated immune 
response within the tumor microenvironment. PD -L1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed 
by [CONTACT_4658], has been shown to correlate with response to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types 
including gastroesophageal cancer. [37] Archival pre- treatment biopsies will be collected from 
 
Page [ADDRESS_828729] demonstrated that certain gene expression profiles correlate with clinical 
benefit and represent reproducible and sensitive tools that define common features of the immune microenvironment associated with response to pembrolizumab across multiple tumor types. [18, 37] Commercially available nanostring technology will be used to look at a 770 gene 
panel which combines markers for 24 different immune cell types and populations, 30 common cancer antigens and genes that represent all categories of immune response including key checkpoint blockade genes.  The 18 gene T -cell inflamed GEP (weighted sum of the normalized 
values for the genes) previously shown to be predictive of response to pembrolizumab will be 
determined. [37]  The [ADDRESS_828730] activity, and profile  of the immune response 
is planned to see if there is sensitization occurring to PD -1 inhibition.  Blood will be collected 
for correlative biomarker analysis on study day 1 prior to initiation of lenvatinib.  Repeat blood draws will be done on day 8, prior to pembrolizumab administration and on C2D1 prior to pembrolizumab administration.  The numbers of total T cells, CD4T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, and NK cells per mL of peripheral blood, the relative populations of these lymphocyte subsets, and the relative frequency of proliferating, naïve, effector, and memory T cells, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_4133].  Serum marker levels will be summarized descriptively and 
graphically for the patient population. The time course of expression levels will also be summarized g raphically by [CONTACT_4676].

5.3.1 Dose Selection  and Modification 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Selection  
Dose and schedule are based on phase I results from ongoing study “Phase 1b/2 Trial of Lenvatinib Plus Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Selected Solid Tumors ” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  
Subjects with non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, urothelial 
cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or melanoma  were treated with 
pembrolizumab 200mg IV every three weeks with esc alating doses of lenvatinib in order to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose.  The MTD was determined to be 20mg of lenvatinib daily in combination with pembrolizumab.

 Clinical Research Protocol  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modification (Escalation/Titration/Other)  
If one therapeutic agent is either hel d or permanently discontinued secondary to toxicity, 
then therapy with the other study agent  should continue and the subject  should remain on -
study with full adherence to all protocol- related requirements .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Dose Interruptions and Modifications for Pembrolizumab  
Adverse events (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab  exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose 
or several months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must  be withheld for drug-
related  toxicities  and severe or life- threatening AEs as per 3 below. See Section 5.5.1 for 
supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

mL/hr).  Otherwise dosing will be held until symptoms resolve and the subject should be premedicated for the next scheduled d ose. 
c Patients with intolerable or persistent Grade [ADDRESS_828754] dose.  
 
Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to study therapy ( e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, subject  vacation, 
and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor  (NYU Langone Medical 
Center) . The reason for interruption should be documented in the subject 's study r ecord. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Interruptions and Modifications for Lenvatinib  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_828755] BP < 140/90 mmHg at the time of study entry and, if known to be hypertensive, are on 
antihypertensive therapy before they start treatment with lenvatinib . The early detection and  
effective management of hy pertension are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib  dose 
interruptions and reductions. Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as the BP is  
confirmed to be > 140/[ADDRESS_828756]'s clinical  circumstances and follow standard 
medical practice. For previously normotensive subjects, monotherapy with one of the classes 
of antihypertensives should be started when BP > 140/[ADDRESS_828757] is at imminent risk to  
develop a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complications of 
uncontrolled hypertension (e.g., BP > 160/100 mmHg, significant risk factors for cardiac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant co -morbidities). Once the blood 
pressure is controlled, lenvatinib should be resumed as described below.  
 
 
Page 58 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
The following guidelines should be followed for the management of systolic BP > 160 mmHg 
or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg confirmed on repeat measurements after an hour:   
• Continue study drug and institute antihypertensive therapy for subjects not already  
receiving this.  
• For those subjects already on antihypertensive medicatio n, the dose of the current agent 
may be increased, if appropriate, or one or more agents of a different class of antih yperte nsive should be added. 
• If systolic  BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_622435], then lenvatinib  administration should be interrupted and 
restarted at a dose of 14 mg once daily when BP < 150/95 mmHg. 
• If systol ic BP > 160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg recurs on the 14 mg once 
daily dose despi[INVESTIGATOR_3060] (either by [CONTACT_3137] a different class of antih ypertensive), then lenvatinib administration should be interrupted and restarted 
at a dose of 10 mg once daily when BP < 150/95 mmHg. 
• If systolic BP >160 mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg recurs on the 10mg once daily dose despi[INVESTIGATOR_3060] (either by [CONTACT_3137] a different class of antihypertensive), then study drug administration should be interrupted and  additional 
dose reduction should be discussed with the sponsor. 
 The following guidelines should be followed for the management of Grade 4 hypertension (life  
threatening consequences): 
• Institute appropriate medical management.  
• Discontinue lenvatinib 
  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Management of Proteinuria 
Regular assessment for proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Study Flow Chart 
(Section 6.0).   Guidelines for assessment and management of  proteinuria are  summarized as 
follows:  
• If 
proteinuria > 2+ is detected on urine dipstick testing, study drug will be continued 
and a 24- hour urine  collection for total protein will be obtained as soon as possible 
within 72 hours to verify  the grade of proteinuria. Grading according to the National 
Cancer Institute's (NCI)  Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE 
v4.03) will be  based on the 24 hour urinary protein result. Management of lenvatinib  
administration  will be based on the grade of proteinuria according to the Dose 
Reduction and Interruption Instructions provided in Table 8.

5.3.2 Timing of Dose Administration 
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed on the Trial Fl ow Chart (Section 6.0).  Trial treatment may 
be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: - 5 min/+10 min).  
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution.

 Clinical Research Protocol  
5.3.3 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, the Sponsor  (NYU Langone Medical Center) , investigator 
and subject will know the treatment administered.  
5.4 Concomitant Medications  and Vaccinations A llowed and  Prohibited  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the  exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be requir ed.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the [COMPANY_006] C linical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination 
rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_828763]’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the cas e report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over -the- counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_828764] dose of trial treatment s hould be recorded for serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ) and events of clinical interest ( ECIs ) as defined in Section 7.2. 
5.4.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_595207] (including retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of this trial: 
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab and lenvatinib 
• Radiation therapy
  
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed at the investigator’s discretion .   
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_828765] dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster , yellow fever, rabies, BCG, a nd 
typhoid vaccine.  
 
Page 61 of  115 
 Clinical Research Protocol  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  Replacement therapy (e.g., physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pi [INVESTIGATOR_12978], etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment  and is allowed with 
dosing not to exceed 10mg daily of prednisone equivalent. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects 
may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]- Treatment Follow -up Phase. 
5.5 Rescue Medications  and Supportive Care  
5.5.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  Sugges ted supportive care measures for the management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, t hese 
guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as 
additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The  treatment guidelines below are intended to be applied 
when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrol izumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator  does not 
need to follow the treatment guidance  (as outlined below) . Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for dose 
modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.

 7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Study Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures  to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Furthermore, additional evaluations/ testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/ or 
[COMPANY_006] and/or Eisai for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing 
may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may req uire that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, 
such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. 
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent  from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial. 
Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_423]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally 
acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated signature [CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation 
in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any wr itten information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ approval opi[INVESTIGATOR_130974].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to  the subject’s 
willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB requirements, applicable laws and regulations and 
Sponsor requirements.

 7.1.2 Clinical Procedures  and Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow-up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 (see Section 1 1.2).  Toxicities will be 
characterized in terms regarding seri ousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with 
regard to trial treatment.  
Please refer to section 7.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Exam 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a physical exam during the screening period and subsequent visits.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as 
medical history.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Study Flow Chart (Section 6.0).  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], weight and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Section 11.1) at screening,  
prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and discontinuation of trial treatment as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease 
Tumor assessments will be based on RECIST v1.1 and will be performed according to the schedule presented in Sections 6.0 and 7.0.  Tumor assessments should include the following evaluations: physical examination and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast. If CT with contrast is contraindicated, CT without contrast is preferred over MRI. The same method is preferred for all subsequent tumor 
assessments.  
 
Measurability of Tumor Lesions 
Tumor lesions will be categorized as follows: 
 • Measurable Lesions - Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
Product:    Pembrolizumab   
Protocol/Amendment No.:  May 18, 2020v2.0   
 
Page 75 of 115  
 ◦ [ADDRESS_828787] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the 
   slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm) 
◦ 10 m m caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial)  
◦ Malignant lymph nodes are considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
   lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_828788] scan (CT scan  
   slice  thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm)  
 
• Nonmeasurable Lesions - Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions  (or sites of 
disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological  lymph nodes with 
≥ 10 to < 15 mm in short axis). Lesions consider ed truly  nonmeasurable include the following: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial  effusion, and inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung,  abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by [CONTACT_87415].  • Target Lesions - All lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of  2 lesions 
per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target  lesions. It may 
be the cas e that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement 
in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  
 • Non-target Lesions - It is possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the  same 
organ as a single item on the case report form ( e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or 
“multiple liver metastases”).  
 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
• Complete Response - Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathol ogical lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may 
not be “0” if there are target nodes).  
 • Partial Response - At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions,  
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 • Progressive Disease - At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions,  
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the  
smallest on study). In addition t o the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also  demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: The appearance of one or more  
new lesions may be considered progression.)  • Stable Disease - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suf ficient increase to  
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.

 arget Lesions

Page 76 of 115  
  
• Complete Response - Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of  tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm in short 
axis).  
 • Non -complete Response/Non -progressive Disease - Persistence of 1 or more non- target  
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 • Progressive Disease - Unequivoca l progression of existing non- target lesions will be  defined 
as the overall level of substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even  in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discont inuation of therapy. In the absence of measurable disease, change in nonmeasurable 
disease comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be  required to declare PD for 
measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a pleural  effusion from “trace” to “large,” 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to  widespread.  
 
Appearance of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions is considered PD according to RECIST v1.1. Considering the 
unique response kinetics that have been observed with immunotherapy, new lesions may not represent true disease progression. In the absence of rapid clinical deterioration, subjects may continue to receive study treatment until confirmed PD.  
 
Evaluation of Overall Response 
Treatment of subjects may  continue 
after the initial assessment of PD if the investigator determines the subject is clinically 
improving and is deriving benefit from treatment. In the  absence of clinical deterioration, such 
modifications to the RECIST criteria may discourage  the early disco ntinuation of 
pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib  and provide a  more complete evaluation of the 
combination activity than would be seen with conventional response criteria.

Multiplexed -
 gene expression profiling (5 slides) 
Research biopsies will be subjected to RNA extraction and analysis to assess expression of 
immune -related genes. The NanoString technology is a variation on the DNA microarray, 
and permits analysis of up to 800 transcripts in a single reaction. This platform  has been 
validated for application to both RNA from frozen tissue and RNA extracted from FFPE samples . The nCounter®PanCancer Immune Profile Panel developed by [CONTACT_124442], Inc. 
allows analysis of 770 genes for 24 different immune cell types and populations, 30 common cancer antigens and functional markers including checkpoint blockade genes (http://www.nanostring.com/ ).  
RNA will be isolated from 5 X 5um sections of formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded material. 
RNA will be extracted from tissue at the NYU Translational Research Laboratory using  the 
RNeasy® kit (Qiagen). The resulting RNA will be quantified using a bioanalyzer and 250ng used for targeted gene expression analysis following manufacturer's protocols. The  resulting 
data will be interrogated to establish whether a limited and defined gene -expression

 Report Promptly, but no later than 5 working days:  
Researchers are required to  submit reports of the following problems promptly but  no later 
than 5 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:  
• Unanticipated problems including adverse events  that are unexpected and related  
– Unexpected : An event is “unexpected” when its specificity and severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -
approved informed consent document and other relevant sources of information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts.  
– Related to the research procedures : An event is rel ated to the research procedures  
if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], the event was more  likely 
than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
– Harmful : either caused harm to subjects or others, or placed them at increased risk  
 
Other Reportable events:  
The following events  al so require prompt reporting  to the IRB, though no later than  5 working 
days: 
• Complaint of a research subject  when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol deviations or violations  (includes intentional and accidental/unintentional 
deviations from  the IRB approved protocol) for any of the following situations:  
– one or more participants were placed at increased risk of harm  
– the event has the potential to occur again 
– the deviation was necessary to protect a subject from immediate harm 
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Incarceration of a participant  when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain 
on the study. 
• New Information indicating a change to the risks or  potential benefits  of the research, 
in terms of severity or frequency. (e.g. a nalysis indicates lower -than-expected response 
rate or a more severe or frequent side effect; Other research finds arm of study has no therapeutic value; FDA labeling change or withdrawal from market)

working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse event for  collection purposes. An 
overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non- serious event of clinical interest and must be reported within [ADDRESS_828824]:   Pembrolizumab/ MK-3475

previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_828826] to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
[COMPANY_006]  Product  Did [COMPANY_006]  product cause the adverse event? The determinati on of the likelihood that [COMPANY_006]  product caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_75368] a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a 
medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available 
information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between [COMPANY_006]  product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components  and their 
respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely [COMPANY_006]  product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was a ctually exposed to [COMPANY_006]  product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], 
diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of [COMPANY_006]  product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug- induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)? 
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_622464], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors

(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_77992]’s product; or (3) the trial is a single- dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the sub ject re -exposed to [COMPANY_006]  product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (3)

7.2.6 Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in 
accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622440]. 
7.2.7 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_622441], there are no 
formalized stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. However, should any serious and unexpected adverse events occur, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622442]. 
7.2.8 Medical Monitoring Plan  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her 
site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan.  The Data Safety and Monitorin g Committee (DSMC) will 
review the study at least annually.  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Per the NYU PCC Institutional Data Safety and Monit oring Plan, this phase II trial will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_622465]  (from the date the first subject  is enrolled), at dose 
escalation point and subsequent cohort activation, and at the completion of the study prior to study closure. This review includes accrual data, subject demographics and adverse events.  Principal Investigators are required to attend the review of their studies. Additional reviews can be scheduled based on SAE reports, investigator identified issues, external information, etc.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_828828]  ID number(s),  and emails  all requested  
documents  to the quality  assurance specialist by [CONTACT_622466].  All documents  
are reviewed  and a monitoring report  is submitted within  [ADDRESS_828829]:   Pembrolizumab/ MK-3475

 communication  with the site monitor,  the Sponsor  or representatives,  and review/entry  of 
data into the electronic  study  database.  Continued non-compliance  and failure  to submit  
documentation will result  in the suspension of subject  enrollment  at the site, until the 
documents  have  been  received.  
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_828830] the null hypothesis of  <10% RR  (CR+PR)  versus 
the alternative hypothesis of >30% overall response rate requires an overall sample size of 29 
subjects  in order to achieve 80% power with a significance level of 5%.  After testing the 
combination therapy on [ADDRESS_828831] stage, the trial will be 
terminated if there are 1 or fewer responses. If there are 2 or more responses  (including non-
confirmed response s) the trial will continue on to second stage . A response e valuable subject 
is defined as having r eceived both investigational agents for at least [ADDRESS_828832] 
scan for disease evaluation on therapy, or evidence of early (prior to 2 cycles) clear progression on physical examination, or death prior to [ADDRESS_828833] overall response for the i nterim 
analysis  will be assessed up to 6 months on treatment.  If the trial goes on to the second stage, 
then if there are 5 or fewer responses   out of 29 response evaluable subjects , the combina tion 
therapy will be rejected . If there are 6 or more responses (including non- confirmed responses) 
over the entire treatment duration - the combination will be studied further.  
At the end of the study, toxicities, as measured by [CONTACT_26277] 4.03, will be 
described by [CONTACT_622467], by [CONTACT_540281], with the maximum grade over 
all cycles used as the summary measure per patient. Overall response rates (defined as PR plus CR) will be estimated with exact 95% confidence intervals. PFS and OS will be described using Kaplan -Meier curves.  
All subjects  who receive at least one dose of the lenvatinib and/or pembrolizumab combination 
will be evaluable for toxicity.  
Efficacy Measures  
Response rate (RR): Best overall response will be calculated as the best response (CR  or PR) 
recorded from the start of treatment for each s ubject , and will be used for the summaries of 
objective response. Best overall response will be determined programmatically based on the RECIST 1.1 criteria. For this study confirmation of response within 4 weeks will not be 
required . 
Progression Free Survival  (PFS): is defined as the interval between the date of start of treatment 
and the earlier date of objective disease progression per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_828834]:   Pembrolizumab/ MK-3475  
Protocol/Amendment No.:  May 18, 2020v2.0   
 
Page 103 of 115  
 Overall Survival (OS): is calculated as the interval from the start of treatment to the date of 
subject  death (any cause).  
RECIST 1.1 assessments (including Target Lesion measurements) will be used to determine ORR and PFS.  Imaging assessments will be made every 6-[ADDRESS_828835] progressive disease.  
AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs.  
AEs will be coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities).  
 
Biomarker/Exploratory Objectives  
All biomarker analyses will consist of descriptive statistical summaries at baseline (means, 
medians, standard deviations, quantiles, ranges, etc.) and graphical displays (e.g. boxplots). Similar summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_622468]. We will use non- parametric tests to assess the relationships 
between PDL1 status , gene expression profiles  of interest,  and response to combination 
treatment of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib . Outcome relationships will be largely explorative 
and descriptive.

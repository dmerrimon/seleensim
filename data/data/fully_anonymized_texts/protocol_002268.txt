5. Risk/Benefit Assessment  [ADDRESS_235727] growing immigrant groups in the US, who 
suffer disproportionately high type 2 diabetes (T2D) burden and have poorly controlled T2D. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_45478]-documented T2D disparities in this minority group, limited work has been 
conducted to improve health outcomes in Chinese Americans. The goal of this Pathway to 
Independence Award (K99/R00) is to expedite the candidate’s transition to an independent 
investigator who possesses focused expertise in development and evaluation of culturally and 
linguistically tailored and sustainable interventions to reduce T2D disparities in Chinese 
Americans. In the K99 phase of this award, the candidate will obtain critical training needed to 
accomplish this goal and will develop a short message service (SMS) intervention to improve T2D 
management in Chinese Americans. In the R00 phase, the candidate will utilize acquired skills to 
conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_198115].  In the K99 phase, the candidate will also conduct pi[INVESTIGATOR_198116] 
R00 phase. More specifically, the aims are to 1) characterize barriers and facilitators of glycemic 
control in Chinese Americans with T2D (Aim 1a); 2) develop culturally and linguistically tailored 
SMS intervention content (Aim 1b); and 3) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the SMS 
intervention in a pre-, post-test study (Aim 1c). In the R00 phase, the candidate will refine the 
SMS intervention based on the K99 pi[INVESTIGATOR_198117]-of-concept regarding its 
efficacy in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_198118] 60 Chinese Americans with T2D (Aim 2).  
Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=30 each): 1) wait-list control and 2) SMS 
intervention.  Both groups will continue to receive standard of care treatment for their T2D. The 
SMS group will receive brief lifestyle counseling videos via SMS links. At the end of the study, the 
wait-list control group will be provided the opportunity to receive the SMS-based counseling 
videos. Measurements will be obtained at baseline, 3, and [ADDRESS_235728] control 
group. Findings from this R00 study will inform a larger full-scale R01 efficacy trial of the SMS 
intervention, and ultimately, establish the candidate’s program of research focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_198119]. This project can serve as a program model for other chronic disease interventions in 
Chinese Americans that require lifestyle modification (e.g., prediabetes, hypertension), or for 
disparities research in other high-risk immigrant populations (e.g., South Asians, Hispanic 
Americans). 
In Year 4 of this K99/R00 award (Year 2022), PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lu Hu received additional pi[INVESTIGATOR_198120]. Accumulating evidence shows 
that patients with T2D are more likely to have mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, 
eating disorders, diabetes distress, and other mental health issues than those without the 
disease.[ADDRESS_235729]. Lu 
Hu’ prior and current studies (K99, R00 Protocol Number: s18-[ZIP_CODE]; FAMILY Protocol Number: 
s19-[ZIP_CODE])to administer surveys related to mental health and conduct focus groups with 
participants to gain a deeper understanding of barriers. K99 phase includes [ADDRESS_235730], there are 23 pairs of participants: [ADDRESS_235731] is 133 (50 from K99 
phase, 60 from R00 phase and 23 from FAMILY study). 
 
2.  PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND 
2.[ADDRESS_235732] growing immigrant groups in the [LOCATION_002].6–
8 Multiple studies show that, compared to non-Hispanic whites, Chinese Americans suffer 
disproportionately higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D),9–13have poorer self-management and 
glycemic control,14–18and are at elevated risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_198121].19Lack of 
culturally and linguistically sensitive healthcare providers and programs are the most commonly 
cited reasons for disparities in T2D care and health outcomes in Chinese Americans.20–[ADDRESS_235733] played a critical role in prevention and management of T2D for this population.20–[ADDRESS_235734] limited time (e.g., 10-15 mins) 
with their clinicians during scarce clinical encounters.27,28When language and cultural barriers 
come into play for Chinese immigrants, the lifestyle counselling at clinical settings is even more 
difficult.20,22,23,29,30Given high rates of mobile technology usage among Chinese American 
communities,31–33 an intervention program based on mobile technology has unprecedented 
advantages for engaging patients with lifestyle changes in real time and in their natural settings 
(e.g., at homes).34–36Emerging evidence shows that a text message-based approach (e.g., SMS, 
short message service) is a potentially low-cost, sustainable, and scalable strategy to deliver 
targeted and consistent diabetes education and support.37–39 While evidence demonstrates 
effectiveness of SMS interventions in young or middle aged adults,40their efficacy or effectiveness 
remains untested in Chinese Americans with T2D, who often are older (~60 years old)  and are 
limited English proficient.13 
This K99/R00 study provides a unique opportunity to address this knowledge gap. In the 
K99 phase,  we will conduct qualitative interviews to characterize barriers and facilitators of 
glycemic control in Chinese Americans with T2D ( Aim 1a). Findings from these interviews will 
inform the cultural tailoring of the intervention content. Then we will develop the SMS intervention, 
which includes brief lifestyle counseling videos sent to participants via SMS links ( Aim 1b). We 
will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the SMS intervention in a 3-month, single group pre-, 
post-test study among 30 Chinese Americans with T2D ( Aim 1c). In the R00 phase,  we will refine 
the intervention based on the K99 pi[INVESTIGATOR_198117]-of-concept regarding its 
efficacy in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_198118] 60 Chinese Americans with T2D ( Aim 2).  
Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=30 each): 1) wait-list control; and 2) SMS 
intervention.   
For the Rutgers mental health pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will leverage participants in the K99, R00 phase 
(s18-[ZIP_CODE]), and FAMILY (s19-[ZIP_CODE]) studies (N=133), and add some mental health-related 
questions to understand the mental health burden in Chinese immigrants with T2D. To understand 
barriers to accessing mental health services, we will conduct two focus groups (n=10-16) with 
Chinese immigrants with T2D to gain a deeper understanding of barriers to mental health services.

3.     METHODS AND PROCEDURES 
3.1  Study Design 
K99 Phase  
Qualitative focus groups/interviews (N=20):  We will conduct focus groups/interviews to 
understand barriers and facilitators of glycemic control in Chinese Americans with T2D and to 
develop culturally and linguistically tailored SMS intervention content.  
 
Quantitative pre-, post-test evaluation (N=30):  We will assess the feasibility and acceptability 
of the SMS intervention in a 3-month, single group pre-, post-test study among [ADDRESS_235735] (N=60):  Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=30 each): 1) wait-list 
control; or 2) SMS intervention. We will evaluate changes in HbA1c at baseline, 3-, and 6-
months. In exploratory analyses, we will test mediators (e.g., self-efficacy, diabetes self-
management behaviors, diet intake, and physical activity). 
Rutgers Mental Health Pi[INVESTIGATOR_198123]-sectional quantitative survey (N=133): We will contact [CONTACT_198148] K99, R00 
phase (s18-[ZIP_CODE]), and FAMILY study (s19-[ZIP_CODE]) to ask whether they are interested in joining 
this mental health pi[INVESTIGATOR_198124] a few additional questions. Our target goal is 133. As of 
9/28/2022, all participants from K99, R00 and FAMILY completed their assessments, intervention 
and participation with us. We will administer this mental health survey once this pi[INVESTIGATOR_198125]. This will be a one-time survey administration because the goal of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_198126] a snapshot of the mental health burden in Chinese Americans with T2D. We are 
CARE Study Version 9.29.2022
6 not examining changes over time in mental health, thus, we will not repeat the survey at 3 or 6 
months.  
Qualitative focus groups (N=10-16): Guided by [CONTACT_198149],41we will assess 
facilitators and barriers to accessing mental health services in Chinese Americans with T2D. We 
will explore factors on multiple levels, including individual, interpersonal, community, health 
system, and societal levels. We will select 10-15 participants based on their survey responses 
(who reported elevated stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms) to join the focus groups (2 focus 
groups; 5-8 participants per group) to gain a deeper understanding of barriers to utilizing mental 
health services. We will also ask participants’ preferences for mental health support (e.g., 
individual vs. group-based, in-person vs. phone vs. video-based).
3.2 Sites 
The study will be conducted at the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center (CBWCHC), a 
federally qualified health center located in both Manhattan Chinatown and Queens Flushing 
Chinatown. In 2015, it provided a total of 275,[ADDRESS_235736] 
and leading community centers in NYC, having established a trusting relationship with the 
Chinese American community. In 2016, approximately 5,000 patients with T2D were seen at the 
CBWCHC; the vast majority of them are Chinese.  
CBWCHC will not be engaged in research activities and their role is to identify/refer patients and 
provide space for this study. All research related activities (e.g. recruitment, consenting, 
conducting study procedures) will be performed by [CONTACT_198150]. The letter of support has 
been uploaded in the attachment section.  
To maximize recruitment efforts, we will also identify potential private practices or community 
based organizations in Chinatown areas and work with them to recruit potential participants. In 
addition, we will identify and recruit participants into the study from NYU Langone Health. Similar 
to the procedures at CBWCHC, all of the research related activities (e.g. recruitment, 
consenting, conducting study procedures) will be performed by [CONTACT_198150]. The role 
of NYU Langone Health, these private practices or community-based organizations is to 
help to identify/refer patients and/or provide space for this study.

Rutgers Mental Health Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] : For the quantitative survey, because we will call K99, R00 phase 
(s18-[ZIP_CODE]), and FAMILY study (s19-[ZIP_CODE])  participants, the inclusion and exclusion criteria will 
be the same as each parent study. In addition, participants are eligible to participate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_198127]. For the focus group 
participants, we will review the mental health survey responses from participants and invite those 
who reported elevated stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms to join the focus group discussion.  
 
4.    PROCEDURES 
4.1   Patient Recruitment 
Participants will be identified and recruited into the study from NYC health care facilities, 
including CBWCHC, private practices, community-based organizations, and NYU Langone 
Health and affiliated provider practices. 
 
We will recruit participants using the following methods :   
a.  Posters.  Posters will be placed in NYC health care facilities waiting and examination 
rooms.  Posters will list a contact [CONTACT_198151].  Patients who self-refer will be screened for eligibility. Posters will also be placed in 
Chinese community centers (e.g., senior centers) and distributed during Chinese community 
events. Posters will also be posted electronically on WeChat, which is a popular chatting 
smartphone application among Chinese Americans and Chinese Immigrants.  
b.  Direct referral by [CONTACT_37157].   CBWCHC, NYU Langone Brooklyn site 
providers, and private practice health care providers will approach patients who are potentially 
eligible for the study, solicit their interest in the study. If patients express verbal interest in the 
study participation, their health care providers will share the patient’s contact [CONTACT_198152], or patients will also be able to call (self-refer to) to the number provided in the 
recruitment flyer and speak with a study staff if they are interested in participating. Study staff 
will call the patient and with the patient’s verbal consent the staff will conduct a quick phone pre-
screening to confirm eligibility prior to study enrollment. [CONTACT_198165] is the medical director 
at NYU Brooklyn Family Health Center. We are collaborating with [CONTACT_198166] and her team at 
NYU Brooklyn. They would help refer potential study participants that are eligible and interested 
in our study. The initial referral list from health care providers will only include patient’s name 
[CONTACT_198162]. After verbal consent is 
obtained and documented, the study staff will request the patient’s medical information from the 
CARE Study Version 9.29.[ADDRESS_235739] recent HbA1c value  7%. The report will also 
include demographics including patient name, gender/sex, date of birth, address, phone 
number, weight, height, BMI, name [CONTACT_198163], most recent HbA1c value and 
date of measurement. Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_198128]. The report will be generated prior to the recruitment process to help 
us find potential participants. The report will be kept on a secure electronic NYU research drive 
to ensure the confidentiality of health information and identifying information from potential 
participants. These patients will receive a mailing describing the study and letting them know 
how they can opt out of further contact. The study staff will call eligible patients who have not 
opted out to describe the study, complete the brief eligibility screener and offer enrollment. 
While screening potential participants by [CONTACT_756], demographics and the most recent HbA1c 
value will be confirmed or updated.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_235740] complete a brief 
phone screener to screen whether or not the participant is eligible. Once eligibility is confirmed, 
the study staff will discuss with the patient what active participation in this study means (review 
verbal consent, interviews, potential benefits, and risks of participations), the purpose and 
limitations of the study, and requirements of the study. If the patients verbally agree to 
participate, the patient’s primary care physician will also be notified that the patient is being 
enrolled in this study. The verbal consent process will be audiotaped with the patient’s 
permission. The verbal consent is an accommodation due to the rising COVID-[ADDRESS_235741] linking a participant’s name [CONTACT_198164], this information will be kept on a secure 
electronic drive to ensure the confidentiality of health information and identifying information 
from participants. Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_198129].  
 
We will have the verbal consent script available in both English and Chinese. The participant 
can choose their own preferred language and our bilingual study staff will explain the study to 
CARE Study Version 9.29.[ADDRESS_235742] any data from them. 
 
The Informed Consent is a continuous and dynamic process, all participants will be reminded at 
every phone call about the A/V recordings, study assessments and that they are free to withdraw 
at any time. 
For the Rutgers Mental Health Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will use an IRB-approved verbal consent to ask 
whether the K99, R00 phase (s18-[ZIP_CODE]), and FAMILY study (s19-[ZIP_CODE]) participants are willing 
to join this pi[INVESTIGATOR_198130] a few additional questions about their mental health. The consent 
process will be recorded via audio.  
4.3  Study Procedures 
Our NYU study staff will be conducting ALL of the following study procedures.  
4.3.1 K99 Phase Patient Focus Groups/Interviews Procedures  
We will recruit a convenience sample of [ADDRESS_235743] 4-5 focus groups, with 4-5 participants per group. Focus groups will be held at a private 
and quiet location at the CBWCHC. Focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Using 
a semi-structured interview guide, a trained interviewer will use open-ended questions and follow-
up probes to understand barriers to and facilitators of diabetes self-care in their daily life.  
Patients will be paid $[ADDRESS_235744] 
explain the study and consent form to the participants. After the consent form is signed, study 
staff will ask participants to perform a finger stick to check their HbA1c levels. If the A1c level is 
greater or equal to 7%, the study staff will continue with the study survey. Otherwise, study staff 
will thank participants for their interest and time and pay $30 for their time.  
For those who are eligible to continue to participant, they will be asked several survey questions 
and then subscribed to our diabetes videos. They will receive 1-2 SMS-based counseling videos 
every week for 12 weeks (each video is about 5-10 minutes in duration).  HbA1c will be assessed 
at baseline and again at [ADDRESS_235745] the goal and 
CARE Study Version 9.29.2022
10 problem solve any raised questions/concerns. 
Patients will be paid $30 for completing baseline visit and $[ADDRESS_235746] 60% of the diabetes videos. The other focus 
group is with poorly engaged group, defined as participants who have watched less than 60% of 
the videos. For those participated in the focus group discussion, they will receive $30 for their 
time and participation.  
We will reimburse $[ADDRESS_235747] to receive a range of $0-$60 (=$5*12) depending on the number of weeks 
they have completed the videos.   
Due to COVID-19, we will conduct the 3-month and 6-month survey over the phone. For the 3-
month weight measurement, we will ask participants to weigh themselves at home if they have a 
scale at home. For those who do not have scales at home, this will be treated as missing data.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_235748] Procedures  
The R00 phase study is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT) of 6 months duration. 
Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=30 each): 1) wait-list control; or 2) SMS 
intervention.The study will include 3 measurement visits, baseline, 3, and 6 months. Patients 
will be paid $[ADDRESS_235749] (interested patient’s name [CONTACT_91985]) from the 
providers, the bilingual study staff will call the patient and provide more details about the study. 
If patients expressed interest in participation, the study staff will administer several screening 
questions over the phone. After eligibility is determined and verbal consent is obtained, we will 
collect baseline surveys over the phone and randomize them via a computer-generated 
randomization scheme with equal allocation to one of the 2 groups: 1) wait-list control; or 2) 
SMS.  
 
Independent variable: randomization arm
Wait-list control group: All participants will continue to receive the standard of usual care for
their T2D at their providers’ office during the course of our study. At the end of the study, the 
wait-list control group will be provided the opportunity to receive the counseling videos delivered 
to them via SMS links.   
 
SMS intervention: Participants in the intervention group will receive SMS-based video 
counseling, which include both educational and SCT-based behavioral content (see Table 1 
below for a tentative outline of the intervention content). Given the system and personal 
barriers, we believe this SMS-based approach will improve access to culturally and linguistically 
tailored diabetes counseling. Additionally, this approach will allow participants to review the 
videos later on or share with their loved ones who often want to be supportive but do not know 
how. We will send 2 videos each week for a total of 12 weeks with each video about 5-10 
minutes in duration. The videos will be sent via WeChat or regular text messages (SMS). We 
will contact [CONTACT_198153]. WeChat will be only used to send the health education videos. No other communication 
will occur via WeChat. Our study team will remind participants at the beginning of the study and 
CARE Study Version 9.29.2022
11 during the bi-weekly phone calls about not sending any Protected Health Information via 
WeChat. In addition, our education videos do not contain any Protected Health Information and 
it will teach participants about diet, exercise, and stress management in general. We will ask 
participants’ permission to use WeChat platform and advise that sending messages over an 
unsecured application like WeChat is an unsecure and unencrypted form of communication and 
there is a potential risk of disclosing information to an individual who is not authorized to receive 
it (unauthorized disclosure).   
 
We will also let participants know that they can still participate in the study if they decline to 
receive the health education videos on WeChat. As an alternative, we will send the education 
videos as regular text messages to their phones. They can decline at any time during the study 
to receive the videos on WeChat and then we will switch to regular text messages.  
 
We will also help participants to set goals for their diabetes management and then have 
biweekly phone call follow-ups to check in their progress toward the goal and problem solve any 
raised questions/concerns.  
 
Procedures: The study will include 3 measurement phone calls, baseline, 3, and 6 months. 
Patients will be paid $30 for each measurement call. Due to COVID-19, all data will be collected 
over the telephone. Each survey calls will include audio/Video recordings if verbal consent from 
the study participants was obtained.  For participants randomized to the SMS intervention 
group, we will reimburse $[ADDRESS_235750] to receive a range of $0-$60 (=$5*12) depending on the 
number of weeks they have completed the videos. We will also provide $60 to control 
participants if they finish all study related procedures at 3 months assessment.

12 Figure 1. Conceptual Model 
 
Primary & Exploratory Outcomes  
Primary outcome: HbA1c: As part of the usual care, patients with T2D receive a HbA1c blood 
test at their doctors’ office every 3-6 months. To minimize participants’ burden, we will not conduct 
additional blood tests for this study. Instead, we will abstract the HbA1c testing results from the 
medical record at the participant’s health care facility. Once we obtain the consent from 
participants,  we will contact [CONTACT_198154]’ offices for HbA1c results.  
 
Secondary outcomes: Consistent with our conceptual model (Fig. 1), we will also measure self-
efficacy, diabetes self-management behaviors, dietary intake, and physical activities at each time 
points (baseline, 3-, and 6-months). All of these scales have been used and validated in the 
Chinese population. 
1. Self-efficacy: We will use the well-validated Stanford Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale42to 
measure participants’ confidence to manage T2D. This instrument contains 8 items and asks 
participants to rate their confidence level in performing specific self-management behaviors, 
using 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident).  
2. Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors: We will administer the adapted Summary of 
Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) measure43to assess participants’ adherence to 
diabetes self-management behaviors. This scale consists of [ADDRESS_235752] 7 days.  
3. Dietary Intake: Informed by a previous study in Chinese Americans,44we will use the adapted  
Mediterranean Dietary Screener45to estimate dietary intake behaviors in our participants at 
baseline, 3- and 6-months.  
4. Physical Activity: We will use the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)46,[ADDRESS_235753] 7 days. This scale will provide an estimate of the number of minutes 
per week participants engage in each category of physical activity (e.g., vigorous, moderate, 
and mild intensity). We will also use the ActiGraph to objectively measure physical activity and 
sleep. Our study staff will distribute and collect the device to participants once they are eligible 
for the study. Once we receive the device, we will download the data. 
 
 
Covariates: Sociodemographic, health characteristics, and acculturation. We will use a 
sociodemographic questionnaire to collect basic information about the participant such as age, 
gender, education, income, duration of residence in the US, health insurance, the diabetes 
medication regimen, duration of T2D, and medical history. Informed by [CONTACT_198155], we will also 
include surveys to measure Health Beliefs, Diabetes Knowledge, Diabetes Distress, Social 
Support, Mental Health, the Impact of COVID-19, and memory test, which also play essential 
roles in diabetes management.  Interventions:

CARE Study Version 9.29.2022
13 Rutgers Pi[INVESTIGATOR_198134] : Accumulating evidence 
shows that patients with T2D are more likely to have mental health issues, including depression, 
anxiety, diabetes distress, and other mental health issues than those without the disease. We will 
add several mental health and psychosocial related surveys and administer this survey to the 
study participants via telephone at one survey only.. This survey phone call will not be audio or 
video recorded but the consent process will be audio recorded.   We are going to use validated 
measures to assess general stress,48,49acculturation,50 minority stress (discrimination),51
symptoms of depression,52,53anxiety,54loneliness,55social support,56,57 stigma towards mental 
health58, mindfulness59, 60, and mental health seeking behaviors. See Table 2 below. We will 
provide a $[ADDRESS_235754] incentive to participants who complete this survey with us.  
Rutgers Pi[INVESTIGATOR_198135] (N=10-16): We will select 10-15 participants based on their mental 
health survey responses to join the focus groups (2 focus groups; 5-8 participants per group) to 
gain a deeper understanding of barriers to utilizing mental health services. Participants who 
reported elevated stress, anxiety or depressive symptoms will be invited for this focus group 
discussion. We will collect their AV consent to record the focus group discussion. We will also ask 
participants’ preferences for mental health support (e.g., individual vs. group-based, in-person vs. 
phone vs. video-based). Participants will receive additional $[ADDRESS_235755] incentive for their time. 
We will submit the interview guide as a modification later.

5.         RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
CARE Study Version 9.29.[ADDRESS_235756]. Psychological risks include: 1) the possibility that some participants may perceive some 
questionnaire or background data assessment as intrusive or causing them to feel 
uncomfortable; 2) breach of confidentiality. The study involves an intervention designed to 
enhance adherence to standard diabetes care (e.g., adherence to the prescribed diabetes 
medication, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors). If our intervention improves 
adherence to the medication regimen or if participants make lifestyle changes (e.g., increased 
physical activity), more epi[INVESTIGATOR_198136]. We will advise participants of the 
importance of monitoring their blood sugar as suggested by [CONTACT_198154], and to contact [CONTACT_198156]. 
There is also a potential risk for breach of confidentiality on WeChat. To minimize the risk, we 
will remind participants that they should call our study phone number for any questions related 
to the study participation. WeChat will only be used to send education videos. No 
communication will occur via WeChat. Also, we will remind them at the beginning of the study 
and during the bi-weekly phone calls about not sending any Protected Health Information via 
WeChat. In addition, our education videos do not contain any Protected Health Information and 
it will teach participants about diet, exercise, and stress management in general. Based on our 
recent completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (a similar WeChat video study in 30 Chinese immigrants), we did 
not observe any breach of privacy or confidentiality. All of the study team members received 
sufficient training on protecting privacy and confidentiality and have extensive experience in 
working with this hard-to-reach immigrant population. The benefits of receiving these culturally 
and linguistically tailored education videos outweighed the risks.  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_235757] benefit from participating. However, 
information learned during the study may produce benefits for future patients by [CONTACT_198157].  
 
6.  CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA STORAGE 
We will use the IRB recommended RedCap for data storage (openREDCap.nyumc.org). We will 
also work with MCIT to set up a NYU shared network drive which is HIPAA compliant (for offsite 
backup storage) specifically for our study. All study personnel have already taken the mandatory 
HIPAA and Patient Privacy/Confidentiality training modules required by [CONTACT_198158], to 
ensure that they are aware of the importance of patient confidentiality and all appropriate laws 
regarding protection against privacy breaches. Procedures will be in place to ensure that all files 
containing subject information will be kept in locked filing cabinets or password-protected 
electronic databases on a secure server. The majority of study data and all interview transcripts 
will be maintained in electronic files with no patient identifiers other than a study ID number; 
there will be one file maintained separately with its own password protection that links study ID 
numbers to patient identifying information.  
No identifiable information about study participants will be disclosed to individuals outside those 
approved by [CONTACT_198159]. No publications that result from the study will 
identify individual participants. 
 
CARE Study Version 9.29.[ADDRESS_235758]-protected and user-restricted. We will delete potential 
identifiable information from transcripts and audio recordings one year after the study ends. We 
will also encourage participants to use pseudonyms during focus groups and/or interviews. 
During each focus group or interview session, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_198137]. The text-message-based video 
counseling will be protected via password-enabled access. Only study participants will have 
access codes to open these videos. Others in the same household would not be able to open 
the video, unless participants choose to share the access code.  
7. DATA ANALYSIS AND DATA MONITORING
7.1 Data Analysis  
K99-phase Aim 1 : All focus groups will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim into Microsoft 
Word. Atlas will be used to store, organize, retrieve, and analyze the qualitative data. Thematic 
analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data.61To establish coding reliability, the RA and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_198138] 10% of the transcripts and identify kappa coefficient.62We will meet 
weekly to review definitions and assignment of codes, and resolve differences through consensus. 
If no agreement can be made, the study team will be consulted. The RA and PI [INVESTIGATOR_198139]. We will present 
coding schemes to study team, discuss emergent themes, refine codes, and develop a codebook 
that consists of a list of categories and topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Once all data have been coded based on the 
codebook, codes most relevant to the research questions will be subject to further analysis. For 
the quantitative data, a paired t-test will be used to determine pre-post change in HbA1c. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize participants’ satisfaction with the SMS intervention.  
R00-phase Aim 2 : We will employ the “intent to treat” (ITT) approach in analyses. We will perform 
a detailed descriptive analysis of all the data collected in the study. These preliminary descriptive 
statistics will be used to 1) check accuracy and completeness of inputted data, 2) describe 
univariate distribution of each variable at baseline, and 3) examine the associations between 
variables. We will also explore features of the data (e.g., amount and pattern of missing data, 
outliers, excess zeros, departures from distributional assumptions) to determine whether special 
techniques are needed.  
Aim 2a: Establish the proof of concept regarding the efficacy of the SMS intervention for 
glycemic control in Chinese Americans with T2D. We will test whether the [ADDRESS_235759] sizes will be used for sample size estimation needed 
for a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80 for the larger scale R01 study. 
  
Exploratory Aim 2b: Explore the potential effects of the SMS intervention on psychosocial 
and behavioral factors in glycemic control. For continuous secondary outcome variables (self-
efficacy, adherence, and dietary data), linear mixed modeling will be used to examine the group 
and group by [CONTACT_198160] 3- and 6-months. For the physical 
activity data, we will use a GEE logistic model to examine whether there are group differences in 
the proportions of participants achieving 150 minutes/week of physical activity at any level of 
intensity and at a moderate- or greater intensity level.

support in Chinese immigrants with T2D. We will describe the percent of the sample who has 
elevated stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms and the current social support and copi[INVESTIGATOR_152274]. We will also use correlation to examine the relationships between the mental health 
burden and diabetes self-management behaviors and HbA1c (measured in R00 study).  
Aim 2d: Characterize barriers to accessing mental health services and understand needs 
and preferences in Chinese Americans with T2D.  Similar to the analytic approach used in the 
K99 Aim [ADDRESS_235760]. Atlas will be used to store, organize, retrieve, and analyze the qualitative data. 
Thematic analysis will be used to analyze qualitative data.59
7.2 Data Monitoring  
The purpose of the data safety monitoring plan is to ensure the safety of subjects and the 
validity and integrity of the data. Data and safety monitoring will be the shared responsibility of 
all members of the research team. Personnel involved in monitoring activities will include:  
 [CONTACT_198167], ScD (co-ivestigator). Professor of Population Health at NYU 
School of Medicine (NYUSoM).  
 [CONTACT_198168], PhD, PI, [CONTACT_54979] has worked as a graduate student researcher on several 
NIH-funded projects during her doctoral training and participated in the data and safety 
monitoring meetings. During her current postdoctoral training, she is also actively 
participating in [CONTACT_198169]’s project meetings, including data and safety monitoring 
meetings. [CONTACT_54979] has received intensive training in human subjects research. [CONTACT_54979] will 
be responsible for data safety monitoring of the overall study and [CONTACT_198169] will provide 
close oversight via weekly mentoring meeting.  
 
Data monitoring 
Ongoing quality control will include regular data verification and protocol compliance checks. An 
ongoing review of study procedures will be done to ensure that the privacy of subjects and 
confidentiality of data is not violated. Weekly meetings will be held between [CONTACT_54979] and [CONTACT_198170] and other research staff involved in the project to review the progress of subjects 
enrolled in the study.  
 
Safety monitoring 
It is possible that our intervention might help participants better adhere to the medication 
regimen or make lifestyle changes (e.g., increased physical activity), which may result in the 
need for less diabetes medications and thus more epi[INVESTIGATOR_198141]. We 
will advise them to continue to monitor their blood sugar levels as suggested by [CONTACT_198154], 
and contact [CONTACT_198161]. This safety information 
will be emphasized at the beginning and end of each intervention video. 
 
Because the proposed study is minimal risk, we will not establish an independent Data Safety 
and Monitoring Board. The study team including several experts (Drs. Sevick, Hu) who have 
extensive experience in conducting clinical trials will perform date safety and monitoring. We will 
meet regularly to review inclusion and exclusion criteria, and develop a detailed safety protocol, 
plans for monitoring subjects for adverse events, and a protocol for protection of privacy and 
confidentiality of participants. The study PI ([CONTACT_54979]) will hold weekly project meeting with the 
study staff and provide project updates to [CONTACT_198169] (primary mentor) via weekly mentoring 
one-on-one meetings. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_198142], recruitment,

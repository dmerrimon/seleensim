4   PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA We propose a clinical trial examining the use of perioperative pregabalin to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_263066]. Patients undergoing ureteroscopy with stent placement will receive either a single dose of 300 mg pregabalin PO or an identical placebo in the preoperative area. We will assess patient centered outcomes, specifically examining possible side effects as well as short- and long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_263067].  OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS Primary Hypothesis The use of perioperative pregabalin in ureteroscopy with stent placement will decrease the amount of perioperative pain experienced by [CONTACT_102].  Secondary Hypotheses We hypothesize that the use of the perioperative pregabalin in ureteroscopy with stent placement will:  - Have secondary benefits in the immediate post-operative period - Decrease the proportion of patients receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_263068] [ADDRESS_319903]-operative area.   Secondary Endpoints: Secondary endpoints include the following: - Reported post anesthesia care unit (PACU) symptoms experienced - Score on clock drawing test - Number of unplanned contacts between the patient and the healthcare system within [ADDRESS_319904] procedure - Proportion of patients with new persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_192842] 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery BACKGROUND AND STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  The prevalence of urolithiasis is greater than 8% and increasing in the [LOCATION_002] (US) [1]. There are several treatment options, including ureteroscopy (with or without laser lithotripsy), extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. A recent study in [LOCATION_004] demonstrated that ureteroscopic treatment was employed in more than 40% of interventions [2], with some nationwide estimates up to 59% [3]. At least 300,000 stone interventions are performed yearly in the US on working age adults [4], thereby, there are at least 120,[ADDRESS_319905] a ureteral stent intraoperatively [5]. The most commonly used variety of stent is the double J stent [6], which has long been known to cause post-operative pain in around 80% of patients, as well as irritative symptoms in a sizeable portion [7, 8]. Approximately 12% of those undergoing ureteroscopy will have an emergency department (ED) visit in the first [ADDRESS_319906]-operative days [9], typi[INVESTIGATOR_263069] [10]. Aside from the short-term repercussions of ureteroscopy with stent placement (such as ED visits), there are long-term issues related to pain or the treatment thereof. Recent evidence suggests that approximately 6% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve patients who undergo ureteroscopy will become new persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] [11].    
5   Alpha-blockers decrease ureteral stent discomfort when compared to placebo [12, 13]. Anti-muscarinic medications have also been shown to be helpful with stent related discomfort independently, or in addition to alpha blockade [14], though the evidence is mixed [15]. A recent systematic review failed to find any studies of other medications for stent related discomfort that met inclusion criteria [16]. Subsequently, a well-designed study demonstrated the utility of mirabegron for indwelling stent symptoms [17].  Recent guidelines recommend the use of multimodal treatment strategies in the management of postoperative pain [18]. In several contexts, gabapentin or pregabalin have been shown to be a beneficial part of such a strategy. For example, in percutaneous nephrolithotomy, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study demonstrated that a single dose of 600mg of oral gabapentin 1 hour before surgery significantly decreased catheter-related bladder discomfort, number of patients requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_263070], and amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_263071] [19]. Similarly, outside urology, several well-designed trials demonstrate the positive effects of perioperative pregabalin or gabapentin in the elective, outpatient surgery setting [20-22]. Several reviews and meta-analyses have also supported the use of perioperative gabapentin or pregabalin in various settings [23-26]. The principal side effects of pregabalin are temporary cognition/coordination changes, with a very low risk of serious side effects [27]. No well-constructed studies to date have examined the perioperative use of gabapentinoids in post-ureteroscopy ureteral stent related symptoms.   In preparation for this work, we performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_263072]. We obtained IRB approval for a prospective feasibility study. We enrolled [ADDRESS_319907]-operative and discharge medications. Patient centered outcomes were measured. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95922]-operative counseling about pain control and stent discomfort, 20% expected to need opi[INVESTIGATOR_263073]. The only adverse effect reported more than once was dry mouth. All patients went home on the day of surgery, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]. No patient was prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_263074]. One patient went to the emergency room in the first [ADDRESS_319908]-operative days for a procedural pain related reason. Interestingly, it was actually immediately after stent removal. This patient was prescribed 90 oral morphine equivalents of tramadol. This rate of return is in line with contemporary reports [9].   We learned a great deal from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. First, we saw that it was feasible to enroll patients at a relatively high rate. We approached 12 eligible patients to enroll 10. A surprisingly high number (approximately 1/3) of patients undergoing eligible procedures were not eligible for enrollment, typi[INVESTIGATOR_263075]. We were successfully able to administer the study medication and track outcomes. The number of surveys were quite burdensome – to participants, nurses, and study staff. Insurance companies regularly required prior authorization for the recommended discharge medications (but would approve relatively similar medications). We have modified the design of this study in several ways due to the lessons learned in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY Subject Population Undergoing elective ureteroscopy with stent placement at University of Missouri Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263076] - Age ³ [ADDRESS_319909] Exclusion - Renal insufficiency (eGFR < 50 mL/minute/1.73 m2) - Ureteral stent in place >[ADDRESS_319910] the patient’s care.  PRETREATMENT EVALUATION This study does not require any additional pretreatment evaluations other than those which are part of current clinical care standards for a patient undergoing ureteroscopy with stent placement at University of Missouri. Preoperative evaluations typi[INVESTIGATOR_263077]:  - Routine history and physical examination to include documentation of any comorbidities, medications (including complementary and alternative medications), family history, social history (alcohol and tobacco usage), height, body weight - Past medical history including previous treatment for addiction 
[ADDRESS_319911] surgical history including other uses of stents in the patient’s lifetime - Evaluation of renal function - Any woman of child bearing age who believes she may be pregnant receives a pregnancy test  SURGICAL PLAN The technique of surgery will have been determined to be ureteroscopy with stent placement based on the discretion of the surgeon and patient. None of the techniques utilized in the study are considered experimental and all are considered standard therapeutic options for patients with indications for this procedure. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_263078].    The operating team will consist of surgeons at University of Missouri Department of Surgery-Urology Division. The procedures are performed under standardized general anesthesia with standard intraoperative vital sign monitoring. EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  Not part of usual care This protocol requires several evaluations outside those typi[INVESTIGATOR_83576]. These are all questionnaires.   Timing Questionnaire Respondent Before day of surgery OR on day of surgery Screening questionnaire Study staff  Baseline questionnaire and demographic information Patient  E-consent Patient  Preop Watson clock drawing test and visual analog scale of pain Patient Day of surgery PACU Study staff  Watson clock drawing test and visual analog scale of pain $ Patient [ADDRESS_319912] op chart review Study staff  Early patient questionnaire $ Patient [ADDRESS_319913] Study staff/Treatment staff  Evaluation of trial Patient $ indicates questionnaires for which compensation will be provided. Please see details of compensation.  Usual care Routine evaluation and management for those undergoing ureteroscopy with stent placement include: ASA classification, assigned by [CONTACT_263085] (crystalloid, colloid, blood products) PACU medication Discharge medication Follow up plan 
8   TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS Various symptoms have been associated with the administration of pregabalin in the perioperative setting. The risk of serious adverse events in this use of pregabalin is low [27] and the potential benefits of this treatment may outweigh the risks. This will be recorded in the PACU questionnaire.    Surgical complications will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and reviewed using the institutional standard for complications reporting for all surgical patients as followed by [CONTACT_263086]. Standardized graded complications and adverse effects at UM utilize the five-point modified Clavien-Dindo system. Grade I include complications requiring monitoring but no intervention; Grade II requires bedside or medical treatment; Grade III constitute adverse events requiring surgical or procedural intervention with return to normal functioning; Grade IV includes disabling, life-threatening complications with resulting functional loss and grade V is death of the patient. This is a modification of the Clavien-Dindo system for reporting complications with defined, categorized and classified events that will be segregated into time periods of ≤30 days, 31-90 days and > 90 days after surgery and includes medication complications following NCI CTCAE version 5 guidelines. CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  The intraoperative period is defined as the period from anesthesia induction to the extubation of the trachea. The surgical time is determined from the incision to the final skin closure.  The postoperative period is defined as the period from the extubation to various study endpoints.  Blood loss is defined as the estimate accounted from the suction device and absorptive sponges during the procedure, as described and agreed upon by [CONTACT_11065], anesthesiologist, circulating nurse, and surgical technician as covered by [CONTACT_76404].  The patient’s pain will be evaluated with a visual analogue scale of pain [28]. This may either be done digitally or by [CONTACT_29160] [29].  Adverse events will be measured with an optional PACU questionnaire for nurses as well as by [CONTACT_263087].   Neurological changes will be measured using the Watson[30] clock drawing test.  Satisfaction will be evaluated via questionnaires at subsequent time points.    Need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_263079], chart review, and review of any available prescription database. CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they express a desire to do so or if it is determined to be in the patient’s best interest to do so.  BIOSTATISTICS Sample Size The study will be powered with an 80% probability to detect a 10% difference in the primary outcomes. It will also assume a loss to follow up rate of 50%. This will require approximately 200 total subjects with a planned 1:[ADDRESS_319914] 500 eligible procedures are conducted each year at our institution. Accounting for excluded patients and those who do not wish to participate, we estimate that full enrollment should be attainable within one year.  Analysis A formal statistical analysis plan, crafted by [CONTACT_263088], will be finalized prior to data analysis.   
9    The primary outcome will be the score on the visual analog scale of pain in the PACU.  Secondary outcomes reported will be the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_263080] (in oral morphine equivalents) in the first thirty post operative days. Also reported will be the proportion of patients requiring narcotic pain medication, a composite of unplanned healthcare interactions within the first [ADDRESS_319915]-operative days, PACU length of stay, nausea/vomiting, changes in cognition or coordination, and a composite of serious adverse events (ICU admission or death) within the [ADDRESS_319916]-operative days.   Analyses will be performed in R. For the primary outcome, student’s t-test will be used to compare the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_263080]. For the secondary outcomes, either chi-squared or student’s t-test will be performed to test for differences between those who received perioperative pregabalin and those who received placebo. For the secondary outcomes, multiple testing will be corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [31]. RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES Research Participant Registration We will confirm eligibility as defined in the section entitled Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility.   We will obtain informed consent, by [CONTACT_30578].  Participant randomization Randomization will be undertaken using the randomization module available in REDCap. Patients will be randomized to either “Group A” or “Group B”. Medications will be distributed via the investigational pharmacy according to patient allotment. No one outside the investigational pharmacy will have knowledge of which group receives active medication.   DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES The research team will be responsible for project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, IRB correspondence, problem resolution and prioritization and coordination of the protocol study team activities. The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure departmental server or will be stored online in the university approved resource, REDCap [32]. Source documentation and regulatory binders will be stored in a locked filing cabinet within a locked department office space. These sites are exclusively used for research documents and only members of the research team will have access to files for this study.   Quality Assurance Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates, and extent and accuracy of evaluations will be monitored throughout the study period. Potential problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action.   Data and Safety Monitoring The MU Health Care Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found online.   There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response and staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of the clinical trials program.  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS Benefits and Risks The experimental intervention (perioperative pregabalin administration) is currently used at University of Missouri Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263081]. Numerous studies have shown significant patient benefits in all fields, including Urology. Several reviews have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of perioperative 
10   gabapentinoid administration. The principal side effects of pregabalin are temporary cognition/coordination changes, with a very low risk of serious side effects. Therefore, we do not believe that the therapeutic aspects of this trial pose any serious risk different from patients undergoing ureteroscopy with stent placement under standard procedures.    Toxicities and side effects Adverse outcomes are not anticipated with the regimen of pregabalin used in this study. Patients are closely monitored during the perioperative period and any serious events will be immediately brought to the attention of the study staff. All potential side effects will be recorded in questionnaires.   Alternatives / Therapeutic options The alternative to participation in the trial would be to undergo ureteroscopy with stent placement according to the surgeon’s standard practice and not to participate in the study.  The patient may or may not receive pregabalin in this case. No other aspect of patient care would differ.  Financial Costs and Burdens The cost of study drug and study drug administration will be covered by [CONTACT_263089].   Patient incentives The patients will be offered the following compensation:  Timing Amount Requirement Day of surgery $5.[ADDRESS_319917]-op $5.00 Completion of early patient questionnaire We may extend this to later time points pending future funding.   Monies will be supplied to patients in the form of e-gift certificates.  Privacy and Confidentiality We will keep the study records confidential. No identifiers will be used in any reports or publications resulting from the study.   Volunteering Nature of the Study Participation is entirely voluntary. All aspects of patient’s care and monitoring will be unaffected by [CONTACT_263090].  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Any SAE will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar days. The reporting procedure will be followed as outlined in the University of Missouri protocol found in the “Core Standard Operating Procedure for Event Reporting.”.  INFORMED CONSENT PROCEDURES Before protocol-specified procedures are carried out, consenting professionals will explain full details of the protocol and study procedures as well as the risks involved to participants prior to their inclusion in the study. This may be performed by [CONTACT_648]. Participants will also be informed that they are free to withdraw at any time. All participants will submit an electronically signed consent form. This consent form meets the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations and the Institutional Review Board.   Before any protocol-specific procedures can be carried out, the consenting professional will fully explain the aspects of patient privacy concerning research specific information. In addition to signing the IRB 
[ADDRESS_319918] agree to the Research Authorization component of the informed consent form.  Each participant will sign the electronic consent form. The participant will receive a copy of the informed consent form. A member of the study staff will also sign the electronic consent form.

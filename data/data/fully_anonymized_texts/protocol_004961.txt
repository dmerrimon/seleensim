Title: Correlation of Trust and Outcomes Following Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pai n 
NCT#: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Date: 6/10/[ADDRESS_293924] (IRB) at the University of South 
Dakota served as the IRB of record with joint approval from Nova Southeastern University IRB.  
3.3 Procedures  
3.3.1 Participant recruitment  
Various clinic sites (AZ, CA, RI, VA, WA, and WI) were approached through email, 
phone, and direct contact [CONTACT_242235] a data collection site. Clinic sites interested in participating completed an IRB 
Location Site Application along with a clinic site consent agreement (Appendix A). Each clinic 
site had a point of contact [CONTACT_242236], and that contact [CONTACT_242237][INVESTIGATOR_242219]. Once each clinic site and participating physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242220] e set 
up, new patients potentially meeting inclusion criteria of chronic low back pain (pain greater 
than 3 months) coming to the clinic were identified by [CONTACT_242238]. Upon arrival at the clinic, potential patient partici pants were handed regular clinic 
site new patient paperwork, but they were also given a participant recruitment flier. If the patient 
verbally expressed interest in participation, they were provided with an introductory letter with a 
PsychData link. This l ink had the informed consent and the participant was given a Health 
Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) form as part of the IRB process. This method 
of recruitment was utilized to minimize any potential coercion.  
Once patient participants com pleted the informed consent process they were directed to a 
second PsychData link in order from them to complete a participant demographics form 
(Appendix B) that further verified their eligibility into the study. Inclusion criteria consisted of 
greater th an [ADDRESS_293925] 80% of the treatments from the initial physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242221]. Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242222] a physical therapy license to treat patients and employed at a cli nic 
site approved for the study.  
The initial a priori  was set for a total of 64 patient participants with the primary 
complaint of chronic low back pain that had lasted a minimum of 3 months prior to initiating the 
current physical therapy epi[INVESTIGATOR_9694].  The patient were consecutively enrolled in the study at 
the various clinic sites. An a priori  achieves 79% power to detect a Pearson correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_293926] with a significance level of 0.05 with an included 20% dropout 
rate. These results are based on [ADDRESS_293927] one patient participant duri ng the course of the study.  
3.3.2 Instruments – Predictor variables  
 Various instruments were used to measure trust during the encounter. For the purpose of 
this study, three of the most well studied provider -specific trust measurement scales (Trust in 
Physician Scale,29 Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS),[ADDRESS_293928] Scale38) used in 
the physician and psychology literature were chosen that have ite ms written that could easily 
translate to physical therapy practice and patient care. To date, none of these provider -specific 
trust measurement scales had been studied for use in physical therapy practice. General trust in 
the medical profession and physi cal therapy was assessed by [CONTACT_242239].37 A TA measurement scale (Working Alliance Inventory – Short Revised) was used and 
was the only predictor instrument previously used in the physical therapy literature.[ADDRESS_293929]’ s 
perception of their patient’s connection and engagement (PT Survey of Patient Connection and 
Engagement) within the therapeutic process during the physical therapy encounter.  
Trust in Physician Scale : The Trust in Physician Scale29 is one of the first instruments 
developed to assess a patient’s interpersona l trust in their physician. The original published work 
of Anderson and Dedrick in 1990, detailed the development and validation of the Trust in 
Physician Scale. Three different dimensions of trust were assessed: dependability of the 
physician, confidence in the physician’s knowledge and skills, and confidentiality and reliability 
of information between the physician and patient. The Trust in Physician Scale is a patient self -
report tool with 11 -items scored on a 5 -point Likert scale. The labels for the Lik ert scale 
followed the later modified version by [CONTACT_242240], et al.53 (1 = totally disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = 
neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = totally agree). Raw scores can range from [ADDRESS_293930]. The scale was modified for the purposes of this study with the words 
“physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]” inserted any place the original version had the word “doctor”. It has a 
combination of positively (questions #2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10) and negatively (questio ns #1, 5, 7, 
and 11) worded questions. The Flesch reading ease score equates to 52.3 to provide a Flesch -
Kincaid grade level at 9.6 according to Microsoft® Word 365 for Office (Redman, WA).  This 
scale has been used in research in primary care physicians and specialty medical practice with a 
variety of patient populations.29,53,59 (Appendix C)  
Primary Care Assessment Survey : The PCAS28 was developed to measure seven different 
domains of care through [ADDRESS_293931] summary scale assesses the 
physician’s integrity, competence, and role as the patient’s agent. The trust summary scale is 
measured with eight different item questions with a low est score of [ADDRESS_293932]. Seven of the item questions (questions #1 -7) are 
measured by a five -point Likert scale (1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = not sure, 4 = disagree, 5 
= strongly disagree ). Question #8 is scored on a 11 -point scale with anchors (0 = not at all, 10 = 
completely) it requires recalibration to align with questions #1 -7 (1 = 0 -2 precoded item value, 2 
= 3-4 precoded item value, 3 = 5 -6 precoded item value, 4 = 7 -8 precoded item  value, 5 = 9 -10 
precoded item value). Four of the seven Likert scale items (questions #1, #3, #5, #8) are reverse 
score items and must be recoded for final scoring (5 = precoded item value 1, 4 = precoded item 
value 2, 3 = precoded item value 3, 2 = preco ded item value 4, 1 = precoded item value 5). For 
purposes of this study, the word “doctor” was replaced with “physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]” from the 
original scale. The PCAS scoring algorithms calculate a score if a respondent answers at least 
50% of the items on t he scale ([ADDRESS_293933] scale), the missing whole values are inputted 
as the respondent’s average score across all completed items for the scale. A transformed scale 
score can be computed as the product of the actual raw scale score minus the lowest  possible raw 
scale score ([ADDRESS_293934] scale) that is divided by [CONTACT_242241] ([ADDRESS_293935] scale) multiplied by 100. The Flesch reading ease score is 62.6, which equates to an 8.4 
Flesch -Kincaid grade level according to Microso ft® Word 365 for Office (Redman, WA). The 
scale was originally developed and tested on [LOCATION_005] state employees on their level of 
trust with their primary care physician. (Appendix D)  
Wake Forest Scale : The third provider specific trust measurement s cale used was the 
Wake Forest Scale38 developed by [CONTACT_63035], et al. The Wake Forest Scale was developed to improve 
on the various trust measureme nt scales that currently had been published at that time 
(Anderson/Dedrick29 with the Thom modification53, Safran28, and Kao39,118) and to be more 
generalized to other care providers, not just physicians. The Wake Forest Scale development was 
done by [CONTACT_242242]. To address areas of the trust domain that the study team did not think 
where fully covered, they, along with a group of experts developed additional items. After initial 
testing and screening of questions, it produced [ADDRESS_293936] (fidelity = #1 -2, competence = #3 -4 and #8, honesty = #6, global = #5, #7, 
and #9 -10). The items cover question format consisting of a mixture of positive (#1, #4 -7, and 
#9-10) and negative (#2, #3, and #8) statements in Likert categories (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = 
disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). Trust is measured with a sum of the [ADDRESS_293937]. For purposes of this study the questions with 
the words “your doctor” were repla ced with “your physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]”. The final Flesch reading 
ease is 54.0, demonstrating a Flesch -Kincaid grade level of 9.6 according to Microsoft® Word 
365 for Office (Redman, WA).  (Appendix E)  
General Trust in Physician Scale : Patient general trust in healthcare providers has been 
shown to be different than interpersonal healthcare provider trust.[ADDRESS_293938]. An 11 -item scale was formulated from the initial 25 candidate items that were 
based on five domains (fidelity, competence, hon esty, confidentiality, and global trust). Five -
point Likert scale categories were utilized for each question (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 
3 = neutral, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree). The final [ADDRESS_293939] both positive (#1, #3 -6, and 
#8-10) and negative (#2 and #7) worded questions, with reverse scoring for negative items. 
Scores can range from [ADDRESS_293940]. If one or two 
scores were left out, the missing values were imputed with the average score, if th ree or more 
scores were missing the total score was not be calculated and left out. The words “physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]” were inserted for the word “physician” for use with this study. The General Trust in 
Physician Scale according to Microsoft® Word 365 for Of fice (Redman, WA) has a Flesch 
reading ease of 42.4 providing a Flesch -Kincaid grade level of 10.8. (Appendix F)  
Working Alliance Inventory -Short Revised : The Working Alliance Inventory -Short 
Revised (WAI -SR)[ADDRESS_293941] commonly used instruments to measure the alliance 
between patients and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242223].55 A 12 -item short form was originally 
developed in 1989128 from the original 1986 36 -item Working Alliance Inventory129 and revised 
in 2006127 into the current WAI -SR. The WAI -SR has been developed to assess Bordin’s Task, 
Goal, and Bonds dimensions.18 The scale is measured on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 = never, 2 = 
rarely, 3 = sometimes, 4 = often, 5 = always). All items are positively worded and higher scores 
reflect higher levels of therapeutic alliance. Flesch reading ease s core is at 63.0, producing a 
Flesch -Kincaid grade level of 8.0 according to Microsoft® Word 365 for Office (Redman, WA).  
(Appendix G)  
PT Survey of Patient Connection and Engagement : This survey questionnaire was 
developed for use during this dissertation study. An original [ADDRESS_293942]’s perceptions of the patient’s 
engagement and connection with their physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242224]. No 
measurement tool such as this exists based on the review of the current literature. The scale 
contains 10 positively worded items scored on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 = very poor, 2 = below 
average, 3 = average, 4 = above average, 5 = excellent). The score contains two sub -scores 
connection (questions 1, 3, and 7 ) and engagement (questions 2, 4 -6, and 8 -10). The 
questionnaire scores a 62.0 on the Flesch reading ease scale, making it at an 8.5 Flesch -Kincaid 
grade level according to Microsoft® Word 365 for Office (Redman, WA). (Appendix H)  
3.3.3 Instruments – Outco me measurement variables  
 The outcome measurements chosen for this study assessed the patients’ progress during 
their physical therapy epi[INVESTIGATOR_242225]. Patient reported outcomes assessed 
clinical pain and functional progress by [CONTACT_242243] 2.0 (ODI), 
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and a Global Rate of Change Scale (GROC) as these have 
been shown to be more responsive than physical impairment measurements.132,133  
 Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 : Improvement in function is a key outcome measurement 
for clinical conditions and the ODI has shown to have some of the best responsiveness when it 
comes to patients with low back pain.134 The ODI has been an extensively used measurement 
tool to evaluate function and how back pain affects an individual’s ability to do daily 
activities.135-138 The ODI assesses function in 10 categories (pain intensity, personal care, lifting, 
walking, sitting, standing, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], sexual activity, social life, and traveling). Version 2.[ADDRESS_293943] score is recorded. The 
overall score (index) is calculated by [CONTACT_242244] (number of categories answered x 5). This number is then 
multiplied by 100 and rounded to a whole number. Overall index scores can be interpreted for 
the range of 0 -20% for minimal disability, 21 -40% for moderate disability, 41 -60% for severe 
disability, 61 -80% for c rippled, and 81 -100% for individuals bed bound or exaggerating their 
symptoms.139,140 (Appendix I)  
Numeric Pain Rating Scale : The NPRS is a unidimensional measurement of pain 
intensity in adults.132,141 -147 It consists of an 11 -point ordinal scale measuring pain from “0” = no 
pain to “10” = worst pain imaginable. The respondents were asked to report on current, best and 
worst pain in the last 24 hours. All three scores (current, best, and worst) were recorded along 
calculat ion of the average of all three being reported. This scale has been used across various 
diagnoses and age ranges.132,143 -145,148 (Appendix J)  
Global Rate of Change scale : The G ROC scale, as stated in its name, is global rating of 
improvement and satisfaction over the course of treatment.[ADDRESS_293944] common formats of the GROC is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a 7, 
11, or 15 point scale on a number line with 0 in the middle and moving out one integer in the 
positive and negative numerical direction. The end anchors also co ntain the negative and positive 
words of “very much worse” and “very much improved” or ”completely better” with “no 
change” being in the middle at the zero.[ADDRESS_293945] 
reliability.153,154 For purposes of this study the recommended 11 -point scale was used ( -5 = very 
much worse, 0 = unchanged, 5 = completely recovered).152 (Appendix K)  
3.3.4 Instruments – Demographic collection  
 Demographic data was collec ted on both the patient along with the treating physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242226]. Each patient provided information regarding age, gender, 
race, and educational level. The patient’s birth order was recorded, as first born or only child 
have b een shown to accept treatment more readily and stayed in treatment longer.[ADDRESS_293946] was asked. (Appendix B) Each of the participating physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242227] a demographics form providing their age, gender, race, level of physical therapy 
education, specialty certifications (if any), and years practicing as a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
(Appendix L)  
3.3.[ADDRESS_293947]  participant demographic information form and were 
provided a coded ID#.  
At each clinical site, front office staff that recognized potential patients for the study 
(patients being seen for initial evaluation of low back pain or equivalent diagnosis by a p hysical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242228]) gave the patient a research study recruitment 
flier. Those patients interested in participating were provided a link to an online PsychData link 
to complete the informed consent and a HIPAA form . Once the patient participant provided 
informed consent, they progressed to additional PsychData questionnaires to be filled out by [CONTACT_242245][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Information 
collected consisted of : baseline demographic information sheet, General Trust in Physician 
Scale, Trust in Physician Scale, PCAS, Wake Forest Scale, ODI, and NPRS. The online 
participant data collection allowed for blinding of the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242229]. Patient participants received normal physical therapy evaluation 
and treatment as directed by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Upon completion of the initial visit, the 
patient participant completed the WAI -SR, Trust in Physician Scale, PC AS, and Wake Forest 
Scale through a second PyschData link. After completion of the second physical therapy visit, 
the participating physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242230]. Patient participants were blinded to the ph ysical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s responses on this 
instrument. Patient participants continued to receive normal physical therapy as directed by [CONTACT_242246][INVESTIGATOR_242231]. The majority of 
the physical therapy enc ounters (80%) needed to have the initial physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242232]. If less than 80% 
of the visits have the direct care delivered by [CONTACT_242247][INVESTIGATOR_541], 
that data was excluded from primary analysis. Upon discontinuation of the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_242233] [ADDRESS_293948] completed a second PT Survey of Patient Connection and Engagement at the 
conclusion of care. (Figure 1) Patient participants that complete all three series of forms (pre -
initial visit, post -initial visit, and di scontinuation epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) were eligible for a total of $25 in 
Walmart gift cards to be mailed to an address of their choice.  
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  
All data was coded and entered into SPSS version 27.0 ( IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., [LOCATION_003] ) for statistical 
analysis. Patient participant and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_242234], ranges, and standard deviations. The primary correlational statistics was the Spearman rho to 
assess the various individual trust m easurement scores and changes in scores over time and individual 
scores with the primary outcome measurements of pain, function, and global change. The individual 
trust measurement scores, that have not been used in physical therapy, were be analyzed for 
correlation to WIA -SR, which has been used in physical therapy research, with Spearman’s rho. 
Friedman’s analysis of variance looked at changes in individual trust measurement scores over time 
from pre -initial visit, post -initial visit, and discharge. The n on-parametric analysis was used due to the 
ordinal nature of the outcome variables. The PT Survey of Patient Connection and Engagement was 
analyzed for correlation with outcomes and the individual trust measurement scales with the Spearman 
rho. Linear regr ession analysis was done with the individual trust measurement scales and outcomes 
variables for predictive modeling of trust and outcomes assessment.

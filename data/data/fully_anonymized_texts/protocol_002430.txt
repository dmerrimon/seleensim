The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, 
which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects.  The Certificate protects against the 
involuntary release of information about subjects collected during the course of our covered studies.  The 
researchers involved in the studies cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in 
the study in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they are criminal, 
administrative, o r legislative proceedings.  However, the subject or the researcher may choose to voluntarily 
disclose the protected information under certain circumstances.  For example, if the subject or his/her 
guardian requests the release of information in writing, th e Certificate does not protect against that 
voluntary disclosure.  Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA request under the 
Food,  Drug and Cosmetics Act.  
 
The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against mandatory disclosure by [CONTACT_6741], reportable communicable diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to

ABST RACT  
This subprotocol is a component of the  Pediatric MATCH trial  APEC1621 . The APEC1621SC screening  
protocol  details the process used to identify actionable mutations in patient tumor samples will determine 
eligibility for this subprotocol . This is a  phase 2 trial of palbociclib  in children with relapsed or refractory 
solid tumors (including non-Hodgkin lymphomas, histiocyto ses and CNS ) harboring specified genomic 
alterations in  the cyclinD -cdk4/[ADDRESS_522660] thereby [CONTACT_414563].1 Palbociclib’s activity is dependent on the expression of tumor suppressor 
retinoblastoma (Rb1) protein. Palbociclib was granted accelerated approval in February [ADDRESS_522661] cancer. It has demonstrated promising 
antitumor potential as monotherapy or combined therapy in numerous clinical trials.  
 
Palbociclib will be given orally once daily on days 1-21 with 7 days off in a 28-day cycle. The pediatric  
MTD and RP2D was determined to be 75 mg/m2.

Day 28 Evaluation  
 
Palbociclib  will be administered  on days 1 -21; a cycle will be  28 days. Evaluations will occur at the 
end of every other cycle x 3, then every 3 cycles .  
 
Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug related dose -limiting 
toxicity that requires removal from therapy.  Therapy may otherwise continue for up to 2 years provided the 
patient meets the criteria for starting subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any of the criteria 
for removal from protocol therapy  criteria ( Section 10.0 ).

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
 
 Primary Aims  
 
 To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial 
response) in pediatric patients treat ed with palbociclib with advanced solid tumors  
(including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders  that 
harbor activating genetic alterations  in cell cycle genes.  
 
 Secondary Aims  
 
 To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with 
palbociclib  with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin 
lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in 
alterations in cell cyc le genes.  
 
 To obtain information about the tolerability of palbociclib in children  and 
adolescents  with relapsed or refractory cancer . 
 
 Exploratory Aims  
 
 To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through 
evaluation of circulati ng tumor DNA.  
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
CDK4  and CDK6  (CDK4/6 ) encode cyclin -dependent serine -threonine kinases that form a 
complex with cyclinD to phosphorylate the pRb tumor suppressor protein, leading to 
release of bound E2F transcription factors and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. 
Cancer cells have many alterations that overcome the pRb -dependent restriction 
checkpoint, most commonly through either loss of pRb or other alterations that lead to 
constitutive acti vation of the cyclin -D-CDK4/[ADDRESS_522663] common 
genetic alterations include (1) amplification or deregulated transcription of the CCND1 
gene, which encodes cyclinD1, (2) mutation, deletion or epi[INVESTIGATOR_414541] p14ARF and p16INK4A, an inhibitor of the kinase activity of the cyclinD -

of pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) harbor deletions of INI1/SMARCB1  gene 
which re sults in altered activity of the SNF5/SWI chromatin remodeling complex, resulting 
in dependence on cyclin D for MRT cell survival.3  There are currently three selective 
CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib  (PD0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and 
abemaciclib (LY2835219).  There are more than 60 adult clinical trials for these agents 
(one with ribociclib including pediatric subjects) and palbociclib  was recently FDA -
approved for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor in women with advanced

Frequency of biomarker in pediatric malignancies  
Genomic alterations leading to activation of the cyclinD -cdk4/6 -INK4a network are 
commonly detected in both adult and pediatric tumors. Of note, the majority of published 
studies discussed below ide ntified alterations using diagnostic specimens and a variety of 
different platforms.  Furthermore, these estimates of prevalence are likely to underestimate 
the frequency of alterations at recurrence. Recent data for neuroblastoma demonstrates 
evidence of new mutations at relapse as well as clonal evolution of low frequency 
alterations, including recurrence -specific deletions of the CDKN2A  locus in 3 of 23 relapse 
specimens.7,8 The majority of alterations detected in diagnostic pediatric samples to date 
are due to copy number changes and not missense mutations. In a cohort of 82 
neuroblastoma patients analyzed by [CONTACT_414564], SNP and expression arrays amplification 
of the 11q13 region that contains CCND1  was detected in 15% of tumors, deletion of one 
or both alleles of CDKN2A  in 7 tumors and amplification of cdk4 or cdk6 loci in 3 tumors. 
Other neuroblastoma tumors without detectable cdk4/6 copy number gains showed 
elevated mRNA.9 In an independent group of 375 high risk neuroblas toma tumors 
CDK4 (5%), CDK6 (15%) and CCND1 (19%) copy number gains were detected.10 The 
majority of these tumors stained positive for endogenous pRb.  
 
CDK4/6  or CCND1 amplification was detected in 25% of supratentorial PNET and 1 -5%

Consideration of specific agents  
As mentioned above these agents are cytostatic and thus, may be more effective in 
combination trials. Given the mechanism of action for these agents there is some concern 
and early pre -clinical studies to support that they might be protective or antagonistic with 
commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.[ADDRESS_522670] adult studies now combine cdk4/6 
inhibition with other targeted agents that unlike common chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_414542] o n DNA replication/S phase. These include mTOR inhibitors in several cancers, 
MEK and BRAF inhibitors in melanoma, ALK inhibitors in NSLC, and HDM2 inhibitors 
for liposarcoma. These drugs are given orally and LEE011 has a liquid formulation in 
development. Although there is no published data supporting ability to cross the blood 
brain barrier , palbociclib efficacy has been shown for intracranial GBM xenografts26, and 
there are adult Phase II studies ongoing for CNS tumors, suggesting that patients with CNS 
tumors and metastatic lesions could be eligible for this agent.  
 
 Preclinical Studies  
 
 Antitumor Activity  against pediatric tumors  
Palbociclib has been shown to have pre -clinical evidence of activity in CDK4/6 
mutated and retinoblastoma wild -type glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), diffuse 
intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), and neuroblastoma tumor xenograft cell lines . 
10,[ADDRESS_522671] neuroblastoma cases.27 
Palbociclib reduced cell proliferation in a large subset of neuroblastoma cell lines 
and xenograft models (12 of 1 7 human neuroblastoma -derived cell lines) by 
[CONTACT_414565] (mean IC50 = 307 ± 68 nmol/L in 
sensitive lines).28 
 
 Animal Toxicology  
The toxicity profile of palbociclib was studied in rats, rabbits and dogs and 
included single and repeat dose studies, reproductive, developmental and 
genotoxicity studies. Based on the nonclinical safety studies conducted with 
palbociclib, the primary toxicities  included effects on hematolymphopoietic and 
male reproduc tive organ tissues in rats and  dogs. Additional target organ findings 
observed in rats only included altered glucose  metabolism in relationship to effects 
on the pancreas with secondary findings in the eye,  kidney, and adipose tissue; and 
effects on bone a nd actively growing incisor teeth.  Palbociclib also caused effects 
on cardiovascular function, fetotoxicity in embryofetal  development studies, and 
aneugenicity in genetic toxicity assessments. Other  palbociclib -related findings 
were in gastrointestinal tissue, appeared as vacuolation in  multiple tissues, and

included effects on the liver, kidney, adrenal gland, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133],  and 
coagulation times (prolonged) that were of limited severity and/or lacked 
degenerative  features.  
 
 Adult Studies  
Palbociclib is FDA approved in combination with endocrine therapy to treat patients with 
hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer.29-[ADDRESS_522672] common 
adverse event, occurring in approximately 50 -62% of patients receiving the drug. Febrile 
neutropenia is extremely infrequent, occurring in 0 -3% of patients.29-32 
 
 Phase 1 Studies  
A Phase I clinical study was conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of 
palbociclib at 75, 125, and 150 mg once daily dose levels for 21 days of 28 -day 
cycle in 41 adult patients with RB -positive solid tumors (except small cell lung 
cancer or retinob lastoma) or non –Hodgkin lymphoma that were refractory to 
standard chemotherapy. Neutropenia was the only dose -limiting effect. The most 
common non -hematologic adverse events included fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. [ADDRESS_522673] therapy received 
palbociclib once daily for 14 days followed by 7 days off (21 -day cycle). Six 
patients had dose l imiting toxicities due to neutropenia, four receiving 200 mg 
daily; two receiving 225 mg daily, therefore the maximum tolerated dose was 200 
mg daily.33 
 
Palbociclib was administered as 125 mg daily for thre e weeks, followed by [CONTACT_414566] a phase 1/[ADDRESS_522674] common 
adverse events included neutropenia, leucopenia, and fatigue. Two patients 
experienced grade 4 neutropenia, one patient required a dose interruption.34 
 
 Phase 2 /3 Studies  
In a Phase -II study of palbociclib (PD0332991) in histologically confirmed, 
metastatic breast cancer positive for retinoblastoma (Rb) protein and measureable 
disease, palbociclib was shown to be efficacious in endocrine -resistant, HR(+), 
Rb-positive breast can cer.28 Palbociclib was given at 125 mg orally on days 1 to 
21 of a 28 -day cycle. Thirty -seven patients were enrolled; 84% hormone -receptor 
(HR)(+)/Her2( -), 5% HR(+)/Her2(+), and 11% HR( -)/Her2( -), with a median of 2 
prior cytotox ic regimens. Two patients had partial response (PR) and 5 had stable 
disease ≥ 6 months for a clinical benefit rate (CBR = PR + 6moSD) of 19% 
overall, 21% in HR(+), and 29% in HR(+)/Her2( -) who had progressed through ≥
2 prior lines of hormonal therapy. Med ian PFS overall was 3.7 mo nths [95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.9 -5.1], but significantly longer for those with HR(+) 
versus HR( -) disease (P = 0.03) and those who had previously progressed through 
endocrine therapy for advanced disease (P = 0.02). Grade 3 /4 toxicities included 
neutropenia (51%), anemia (5%), and thrombocytopenia (22%). Twenty -four 
percent had treatment interruption and 51% had dose reduction, all for cytopenias. 
No biomarker identified  a sensitive tumor population.29

A phase 2 clinical trial evaluated the and safety of palbociclib 125 mg daily for 3 
weeks, followed by [CONTACT_414567] i n combination with letrozole 2.5 mg daily 
compared with letrozole 2.5 mg daily monotherapy in 83 postmenopausal women 
with advanced estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and HER2 -negative breast cancer 
who had not received any systemic treatment. There were 41 progression -free 
survival events in the combination group compared with 59 in the letrozole 
monotherapy group. The median progression free survival was 20.2 months in the 
combination group, and 10.2 months in the letrozole monotherapy group. Forty -
five pat ients (54%) of patients in the combination group reported grade 3 -4 
neutropenia, compared with one patient (1%) of the patients in the letrozole 
monotherapy group. This study demonstrated that the addition of palbociclib to 
letrozole significantly improved  progression -free s urvival in women with 
advanced estrogen receptor -positive and HER2 -negative breast cancer.30 
Another phase II study in patients with CDK4 -amplified liposarcoma revealed a 
66% progression free survival at [ADDRESS_522675] line therapy with 
sorafen ib, subjects were treated with 125 mg /day palbociclib (PD -0332991), days 
1-21 of a 28 -day cycle, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal from study or death. Of the 21 pts (18 M, 3 F), all had pathologically 
confirmed Retinoblastoma -positive HCC and one patient experienced a [ADDRESS_522676] 
cancer were randomized to receive either palbociclib 125 mg/d for [ADDRESS_522677] cancer that had progressed on prior endocrine compared with 
fulvestrant monotherapy.37 
 
 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
In plasma collected from patients enrolled on  the Phase I trials , palbociclib 
concentrations were  detectable 1 hour following oral administration . This indicat es 
rapid absorp tion. Pharmacokinetics did not vary among the schedules  or within 
each trial,  and PK did not appear to be dose dependent over a dose -range from 25 
to 225 mg flat dosing.  The volume of distribution of palbociclib is  2793  L, which 
is high and  indicat es substantial tissue binding. The half-life of palbociclib is 25.9 
h and supports  the appropriateness of once daily dosing .  Extended PK analyses 
are not available ; however,  the reproducible toxicity of the drug over long -term 
dosing indicates that drug accumulation is unlikely. Excretion has not been 
characterized in detail , however  is predominantly non -renal given a measured renal

In another adult Phase 1 trial palbociclib was  also absorbed slowly (mean Tmax, 4.2 
hours), the mean elimination half -life was 26.7 hours, and it demonstrated a large 
volume of distribution (mean [ZIP_CODE] L).[ADDRESS_522678] defects in cell cycle regulation. The maximum tolerated dose of palbociclib 
for pediatric patients with Rb positive, recurrent, progressive or refractory central 
nervous system tumors is being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1  clinical trial  by 
[CONTACT_414568] (PBTC) . The study is evaluating CNS tumors 
in less heavily (stratum I) pre -treated patients (pts) and the primary objectives of 
the study are to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics 
(PK), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), and preliminary evidence  of efficacy. 
Presence of specific genomic alteration s was  not an eligibility requirement.  
Palbociclib was given orally daily for 21 days in a 28 day cycle for up to 2 yrs. 
Cohorts of 3 -6 patients were treated at 50 (n = 3), 75 (n = 7), or 95 (n = 6) 
mg/m2/day. Among the sixteen eligible p atients  enrolled (median age 13.3 yrs; 
male 59%), 13 pts (76%) had either malignant glioma (n = 7) or DIPG (n = 6). 
Median n umber  of courses received was 2 (range 1 -9). Of 14 evaluable p atients , 
the only DLT observed was G rade 4 neutropenia in 2/4 patients treated at 
95mg/m2/day. Other significant drug related course 1 toxicities included Grade 3 
neutropenia (n = 5) and Grade 3 lymphopenia (n = 2). The MTD was therefore 
determined to be 75 mg/m2/day. At 75 mg/m2, the median  Cmax and T max for Course 
1 Day 1 was 94 ng/ml and 4.02 hr, respectively. The trial is currently enrolling an 
expansion cohort at 75  mg/m2 and an amendment to expand eligibility to more 
heavily pre -treated patients is underway .38 
  
There  is another  recent pediatric Phase I study for patients with MRT, 
neuroblastoma, or other tumors with alterations in cyclinD -cdk4/[ADDRESS_522679] 
using LEE011 (NCT [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) that is not yet reported. An interim abstract 
publication on the first 22 patients (mainly neuroblastoma and MRT) suggested 
there was an acceptable safety profile.39  
 
 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative Biological Studies : 
Pediatric pharmacokinetic  studies are underway as a part of Phase -I PBTC study.  
  
 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
We propose a single arm phase 2 study of palboci clib monotherapy in pediatric patients 
with advanced solid tumors, non -Hodgkin lymphomas or CNS tumors that harbor genetic 
alterations in  cell cycle genes, specifically  CDK4 , CDK6 , CCND1, CCND2, or CCND3 
amplification. Palbociclib will be given orally once  daily on days 1 -21 with 7 days off in a 
28-day cycle at the previously determined RP2D  of 75 mg/m2.38 Evaluations will occur at 
the end of  every other cycle x 3, then every 3 cycles . Therapy will be discontinued if there 
is evidence of progressive disease or drug related dose -limiting toxicity that requires 
removal from therapy. Th erapy may otherwise continue for up to 2 years provided the 
patient meets the criteria for starting subsequent cycles and does not meet any of the criteria 
for removal from protocol therapy criteria.

In the primary cohort of the study we will evaluate 20  mutation -matched (“biomarker 
positive”) evaluable patients of any histology for the primary study aim of determining the 
objective response rate (CR/PR) to the agent. If ≥ 3 patients in the primary cohort with the 
same histology show signs of objective re sponse ( CR/PR ), a histology -specific biomarker 
positive expansion cohort will open after the primary cohort is completed to up to 7 
evaluable biomarker positiv e patients with that histology in order to allow us to estimate 
more precisely the activity in bi omarker positive patients of that histology. A maximum of 
3 such histology specific, biomarker positive expansion cohorts will be permitted under 
this study.

 Genetic Screening Procedures for Eligibility  
 
Patient enrollment onto the APEC1621SC screening protocol is required. In Stage 2 of 
Pediatric MATCH (effective with Amendment #4 of APEC1621SC for  patients enrolling 
on screening protocol) tumor genomic testing results from a CAP/CLIA -certified 
laboratory will be reviewed by [CONTACT_414570]1621SC Molecular Review Committee after 
APEC1621SC screening protocol enrollment to confirm the identification of an a ctionable 
Mutation of Interest (aMOI) for which a MATCH treatment subprotocol is available. 
Questions regarding interpretation of tumor testing results for potential APEC1621 I study 
patients (such as whether a specific mutation would be considered actionab le for the study) 
should be directed to the APEC1621SC and APEC1621 I study chairs.  
 
The treatment assignment to a MATCH subprotocol (if a relevant aMOI is detected) will 
be communicated to the enrolling institution via the COG treatment assignment 
mechanis m, upon which a reservation to APEC1621 I will be secured by [CONTACT_6744]. 
Reservations should be withdrawn by [CONTACT_414571]1621 I.

involved and their attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_414543]’s parents or guardian if the patient is a 
child, and a signed informed consent and assent will be obtained according to institutional 
guidelines.  
 
 Screening Procedures  
Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively  to determine eligibility for this trial 
must only be done after obtaining written informed consent.  This can be accomplished 
through the study -specific protocol.  Documentation of the informed consent for screening 
will be maintained in the patient’s res earch chart. Studies or procedures that were 
performed for clinical indications (not exclusively to determine eligibility) may be used for 
baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.  
 
 Eligibility Checklist  
Before the  patient can be enrolled, the responsible institutional investigator must sign and 
date the completed eligibility checklist.  A signed copy of the checklist will be uploaded 
into RAVE immediately following enrollment . 
 
 Study Enrollment  
Patients may be enrolled on the study once all eligibility requirements for the study have 
been met.  Before enrolling a patient on study, the Study Chair or Vice Chair should be 
notified. Patients who give informed consent for the protocol in order to undergo screening 
for eligibility are not considered enrolled and should not be enrolled until the screen ing is

Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
Therapy will be discontinued if there is evidence of progressive disease or drug related 
dose-limiting toxicity that requires removal from therapy ( Section 6.0 ). Therap y may 
otherwise continue for up to 2 years provided the patient meets the criteria for starting 
subsequent cycles ( Section 5.2 ) and does not meet any of the criteria for removal fro m 
protocol therapy criteria ( Section 10.0 ). 
 
 Therapy Delivery Map  
See Appendix V for therapy delivery map for Cycle [ADDRESS_522700] stable disease and has 
again met laboratory parameters as defined in the eligibility section, Section 4.0  and 
eligible to continue agent administration per the requirements i n section 6.0  
   
 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the  current version of the  NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CT CAE).   All appropriate treatment 
areas s hould have access to a copy of  the current version of the CTCAE v5.0.  A copy of 
the CTCAE v5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Any 
suspected or confirmed dose -limiting toxicity should be reported imme diately (within 24 
hours) to the Study Chair.  
 
 
 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to  protocol therapy . Dose limiting hematological and non -hematological 
toxicities are defined differently.  
 
 Non-Hematological Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any Grade 3 or greater  non-hematological toxicity attributable to the 
investigational drug with the specific exclusion of:  
- Grade 3 nausea and vomiting of less < 3 days duration  
- Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST /GGT  that return s to 
levels that meet initial eligibility criteria or baseline within 7 days. See 
Appendix X II for values that represent thresholds between CTCAE 
grades.  
Note : For the purposes of this study the ULN for ALT is defined as 45 U/L  
regardless of baseline . 
- Grade 3 or 4 fever < 5 days duration.  
- Grade 3 infection < 5 days duration.  
- Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to supplementation  
• Any Grade 2 non -hematological toxicity that persists for ≥ 7 days and is 
considered sufficiently medically significant or sufficiently intolerable by 
[CONTACT_6754].  
• Note : Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuatio n of study drug will not 
be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.

Page 24 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematological dose limiting toxicity is defined as:  
 
a) In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ),   
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, not due to malignant 
infiltration  
• Grade 3  thrombocytopenia  that persists for ≥ 7 days  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia  requiring a platelet transfusion on two 
separate days within a 7 -day period  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia  with clinically significant bleeding  
• Neutropenia or thrombocytopenia that causes a delay of > 14 days 
between treatment cycles (e.g. platelets <100K or AN C<1000 ). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Note : Grade [ADDRESS_522701] be notified of any dosage modification or use of myeloid growth 
factor.  
 
 Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity  
 
 If a patient experiences hematological toxicity as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , the 
treatment will be held.  Counts should be checked every 3 -4 days for 
thrombocytopenia and every other day for neutropenia during this time. If the 
toxicity resolves to meet eligibility parameters within 14 days of d rug 
discontinuation, the patient may resume treatment at a reduced dose (see Appendix 
IV). Doses reduced for toxicity will not be re -escalated, even if there is minimal or 
no to xicity with the reduced dose.  
 
 If toxicity does not resolve to meet eligibility  parameters within [ADDRESS_522702] be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
 Dose Modifications for Non -Hematological Toxicity  
 
 If a patient experiences non -hematological dose -limiting toxicity as defined in 
Section 5.4.1 , the treatment will be held. When the toxicity resolves to meet 
eligibil ity parameters or baseline within 14 days of drug discontinuation, the 
patient may resume treatment at a reduced dose (see Appendix IV ). Doses reduced 
for toxicity will not be re-escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the 
reduced dose.  
 
 If toxicity does not resolve to meet eligibility or baseline  parameters within [ADDRESS_522703] be removed from protocol therapy.

7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT  THERAPY  
 
 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these 
treatments are administered the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
 Investigational Agents  
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
 
 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary . See Section 7.5 for drugs that should not be used 
concomitantly due to potential interactions with  palbociclib . See below for recommendations  
on management of specific toxicities  associated  with palbociclib . 
 
 Growth Factors  
Growth factors that support platelet or white cell number or function can only be 
administered for culture proven bacteremia or invasive fungal infection. The Study Chair 
should be notified before growth factors are initiated.  
 
 
 
 Concomitant Medications  
 
 CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole , grapefruit, and grapef ruit juice  
are not permitted on study. Strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin,  phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St John’s wort are not 
permitted on study. (See Appendix II  for a list of additional agents ). 
 
 Palbociclib is a weak time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 in humans. The use 
of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic range should be avoided for the duration of the study, if reasonable 
alternatives exist ( Appendix II ).

 Radiology Studies  
 Central Radiology Review for Response:   
Patients who respond (CR, PR) to therapy or have long term stable disease (SD) 
(≥ 6 cycles) on protocol therapy will be centrally reviewed.  The Operations center 
will notify the site when a patient has met the criteria for review. The tumor disease 
evalua tions to be submitted for review include baseline (pre -study) evaluations as 
well as all end of cycle tumor disease evaluations which occurred while the patient 
was on the subprotocol therapy study.  
 
 Technical Details of Submission:  
To ensure an adequate interpretation of FDG -PET and CT with contrast scans, 
scans transferred between the treating institutions and the Imaging and Radiation 
Oncology Core Group IROC RI (QARC) must be submi tted in Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. BMP ﬁles, JPG ﬁles, or hard 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ﬁlms) are unacceptable for adequate interpretation of PET and CT with 
contrast scans. Imaging studies must be submitted electronically as outlined in  the 
following paragraph. The images will be made available to study radiologists and 
nuclear medicine physicians for central review.  
 
Submission of Diagnostic Imaging data in DICOM format is required.  
Submission of the digital files and reports via TRIAD is preferred.  Instructions for 
TRIAD set up are below.  
 
Alternatively, the images and reports may be submitted via sFTP to IROC Rhode  
Island. Digital data submission instructions including instructions for obtaining a 
sFTP account, can be found at http://irocri.qarc.org . Follow the link labeled digital 
data.  Sites using the Dicommunicator software to submit imaging may continue 
to use that application. Corresponding Radiology reports may be submitted along 
with the electronic submission via TRIAD or sFTP or may be emailed to 
[EMAIL_084].   
 
Questions may  be directed to [EMAIL_084] or [PHONE_099].  
  
Digital RT Data Submission Using TRIAD (if TRIAD is available at your site):  
TRIAD is the American College of Radiology’s (ACR) image exchange 
application.  TRIAD provides sites participating in cl inical trials a secure method 
to transmit DICOM and DICOM RT files and other digital objects, such as reports.

Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
TRIAD de -identifies and validates the images as they are transferred.  
 
TRIAD Access Requirements:  
Site physics staff who will submit images throu gh TRIAD will need to be 
registered with the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and have a valid 
and active CTEP Identity and Access Management (IAM) account.  Please refer to 
CTEP Registration Procedures of the protocol for instructions on how to re quest a 
CTEP -IAM account.  
To submit images, the site TRIAD user must be on the site roster and be assigned 
the 'TRIAD site user' role on the CTSU roster.  Users should contact [CONTACT_779]’s 
CTSU Administrator or Data Administrator to request assignment of the  TRIAD 
site user role.   
 
TRIAD Installations:  
 
When a user applies for a CTEP -IAM account with the proper user role, he/she 
will need to have the TRIAD application installed on his/her workstation to be able 
to submit images. TRIAD installation documentat ion can be found by [CONTACT_6758]://triadinstall.acr.org/triadclient/    
 
This process can be done in parallel to obtaining your CTEP -IAM account 
usernam e and password.  
 
If you have any questions regarding this information, please send an e -mail to the 
TRIAD Support mailbox at TRIAD -[EMAIL_085].  
 
IROC Rhode Island (formerly QARC) will facilitate the central reviews.  
 
For FDG -PET imaging, the transferre d imaging data should include uncorrected 
and attenuation -corrected PET projection data, as well as the reconstructed PET or 
PET/CT images used by [CONTACT_6759] a response assessment. If low - 
dose CT was used for attenuation correction, the ac quired CT images should also 
be submitted. The imaging data submitted for central review must allow the study 
to be reconstructed and displayed in transaxial, sagittal and coronal formats using 
standard reconstruction techniques. Reconstructed MPEG clips a nd similar types 
of reconstructions will not be accepted. CT and MRI images similarly should be 
submitted in a format that either includes properly reconstructed multi -planar 
viewing formats in soft tissue and bone windows, or includes the thin -section axi al 
acquisition data from which multi -planar reconstructions can be re -created.  
 
Sites not able to submit imaging electronically may submit imaging via CD.   CD’s 
may be sent by [CONTACT_6760]:

 (1) Cycle 5 Day 1  
(2) At disease  progres sion or end of protocol therapy (for patients receiving ≥ 5 
cycles of therapy only)  
  
Peripheral blood samples for circulating tumor  DNA should be obtained as 
follows:  
• For patients ≥ [ADDRESS_522711]  20 mLs (10 mL per tube x 2 tubes)   
• For patients ≥ 5 kg but < [ADDRESS_522712] 10  mL (one tube)  
• For patients <  5 kg researc h samples will not be collected   
 
In all cases, blood draw volumes should strictly adhere to institutional limitations , 
taking other blood draws into consideration.  However, if a reduction in volume is 
required, samples should be col lected in 10 mL increments (ie . 0, 10, or [ADDRESS_522713] is completely 
filled) . 
 
Established institutional guidelines  should be followed for blood collection via 
vascular access devices. Heparin should be avoided in pre -collection flush 
procedures. If therapeutic heparin dosing contamination is a possibility, 
venipun cture is recommended as a first -choice collection metho d. If a Streck Cell-
Free DNA BCT tube immediately follows a heparin tube in the draw order, we 
recommend collecting an EDTA tube as a waste tube prior to collection in the 
Streck Cell -Free DNA BCT.  
 
For patients who do not have indwelling catheters, blood should be collected via 
venipuncture. To guard against backflow, observe the following precautions:  
• Keep patient’s arm in the downward position during the collection 
procedure.  
• Hold the tube with the stopper in the uppermost position so that the tube 
conte nts do not touch the stopper or the end of the needle during sample 
collection.  
• Release tourniquet once blood starts to flow in the tube, or within 2 
minutes of application . 
• Fill tube completely.

Page 32 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
See Treatment and Dose Modification sections of the protocol.   
Palbociclib capsules should be swallowed whole and taken with food.  Do not crush, 
chew or open capsules prior to swallowing.  If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an 
additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the 
usual time.  
 
 Potential Drug Interactions  
In vivo data indicate th at CYP3A4 is important for palbociclib metabolism and 
clearance in humans. For this reason, avoid concomitant administration of strong and 
moderate CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors  (see Appendix II  for list of agents) .   
 
In vitro data indicated that palbociclib has a low potential to inhibit the activities of 
drug transporters P -glycoprotein (P -gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), 
organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cati on transporter (OCT)2 and 
organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Based on in vitro data, P -gp and BCRP mediated transport are 
unlikely to affect the extent of oral absorption of palbociclib at thera peutic doses. [ADDRESS_522719] ( Appendix II ).  
 
 
 Palbociclib  Toxicities  
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a 
single list of reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an age nt 
using a uniform presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the 
comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and 
italicized text. This s ubset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol 
specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below). Refer 
to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting 
Requirements'  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicatio

1751 patients. Below is the CAEPR for Palbociclib (PD -0332991).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in 
parentheses next to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination 
protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different 
SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is 
required .

10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA  
 
 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 
a) Clinical (including physical examination or serum tumor markers) or radiographic 
evidence of progressive disease (See Section 12). 
b) Adverse Events requiring removal from protocol therapy (See Section 6). 
c) Refusal of protocol therapy by [CONTACT_4676]/parent/guardian  
d) Non-compliance that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_6712].  
e) Completion of 26 cycles  of therapy.  
f) Physician determines it is not in the patient’s best interest.  
g) Repeated eligibility laboratory studies ( CBC with differential, bilirubin, ALT (SGPT) 
or serum creatinine)  are outside the parameters required for eligibility prior to the start 
of protoc ol therapy  (See Section 8.1 ). 
h) Study is terminated by [CONTACT_2728].  
i) Pregnancy  
j) Patient did not receive protocol treatment after study enrollment  
 
Patients who are removed from  protocol therapy during cycle [ADDRESS_522720] resolved per Section 13.4.4 , whichever happens 
LATER . The only exception is with documentation of the patient’s withdrawal of 
consent  from the APEC1621SC screening protocol . Patients who are removed from 
protocol therapy in subsequent cycles should have the necessary observations to 
ensure adequate clinical care.  
 
 Follow -Up Data Submission and APEC1621SC Off Study Criteria  
Patients who are off subprotocol therapy will continue to  be followed on the APEC1621SC 
screening protocol. Follow -up data submission will occur until one of the APEC1621SC 
Off Study Criteria is met (See Section 10 of APEC1621SC for details). Ongoing adverse 
events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient is removed from protocol therapy, 
but within [ADDRESS_522721] and CTEP -AERS (if applicable).  Follow -up data will be required until off study 
criteria are met unless consent is withdrawn or the patient dies or is lost to follow -up. 
 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 Sample Size and Study Duration  
APEC1621 I will require a minimum of 20 evaluable patients  and a maximum of 49 
patients, allowing for 15% inevaluability. Assuming an enrollment r ate of 4 -6 biomarker 
positive patients per year, this subprotocol  is expected to be completed within 8-12 years . 
 
 Dosing Considerations   
A pediatric MTD/RP2D has been established for palbociclib ; therefore patients will be 
treated at that dose38. Please see section 5.1  for a specific discussion of the dosing of 
palbociclib to be used in this study.   
 
 Study Design  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 37 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
The p rimary cohort defined below will employ single stage A’Hern designs of N=20 and 
N=10 respectively. The agent will be deemed worthy of further study in the relevant subset 
of patients (i.e. biomarker positive in any histology, biomarker positive in a particular 
histology, etc) if the decision rule is met. Operating characteristics are shown below.  
 
Cohort  N Decision Rule  Alpha  Power  
Primary biomarker positive  20 ≥ 3 responses  10% 90% 
 
Histology -specific biomarker positive expansion cohorts will, by [CONTACT_108], be deemed 
worthy of further study, since they will have at least 3 responses. The table below shows 
90% confidence intervals (Wilson method) for a range of observable response rates.  
 
Cohort Size  Observed Response Rate  90% Confidence Interval  
10 30% 13% - 56% 
10 40% 19% - 65% 
10 50% 27% - 73% 
 
 Primary Cohort :  
APEC1621I  will evaluate a primary cohort of 20 mutation -matched (“biomarker 
positive”) evaluable patients of any histology for the primary study  aim of 
determining the objective response rate  (CR/PR according to the response criteria  
in Section 12.3 )  to the agent. Using an A’Hern design41 with alpha=10%, a sample 
of N=20 will provide 90% power to detect an improvement in response rate from 
5%, if the treatment is ineffective, to 25% if the targeted therapy is sufficiently 
effective to warrant further study. If there are at least 3 responses out of 20  in the 
primary cohort , the biomarker/therapy match will be deemed a success.  
 
 Histology -Specific Biomarker Positive Expansion Cohorts:  
If ≥ 3 patients in the primary cohort with the same histology show signs of 
objective response (CR/PR according to the response criteria  in Section 12.3 ), a 
histology -specific biomarker positive  expansion  cohort will open after the primary 
cohort is completed to up to [ADDRESS_522722] of target  tumor histologies.  
We will open up to 3 such expansion cohorts for biomarker positive patients (i.e., 
if [ADDRESS_522723] ≥ 3 responses, we will open a total of 3 expansion cohorts as 
described above). Note that this can only happen if the response rat e in the primary 
cohort is at least 45% (9/20) and there cannot be more than [ADDRESS_522724] response of PR or CR on the study.  Response rates will be calculated as the 
percent of evaluable patients who  are responders,  and confidence intervals will be 
constructed  using the Wilson score interval method.42 Decision making for A’Hern design 
cohorts will follow rules described above.  
 
Toxicity t ables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence by [CONTACT_6769] . A patient will be counted only once for a given toxicity for the worst grade of

be considered evaluable f or response.  Any patient who receives non -protocol anti -cancer 
therapy during the response evaluation period will be considered a non -responder for the 
purposes of the statistical rule, unless they show an objective response prior to receiving 
the non -protocol anti -cancer therapy (in which case they will be considered a responder). 
Patients who demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by [CONTACT_6770] a response. When  opening expansion cohorts, t he 
evaluat ion period for determination of best response will be [ADDRESS_522726] a response (CR or PR) must have imaging studies reviewed centrally at the COG. 
Centers will be notified by [CONTACT_6771] s table disease. 
Preliminary assessment of activity using institutionally provided tumor measurements will 
be entered into CDUS quarterly. The central review by [CONTACT_6772].  
 Evaluability for Toxicity  
All patients who receive at least one dose of protocol therapy  will be considered in the 
evaluation of toxicity.  
 Progression free survival  (PFS)  
Progression free survival will be defined as time from the initiation of protocol treatment 
to the occurrence of any of the following events: disease progres sion or disease 
recurrence or death from any cause. All patients surviving at the time of analyses without 
events will be censored at their last follow -up date.  
 
PFS along with the confidence intervals will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. 
Patients with local calls of disease progression  (i.e. calls made by [CONTACT_6773]) , 
will be counted as having had an event , even if the central review does  not declare 
progression. We will also report PFS based on central radiology review as a secondary 
analysis, if adequate number of disagreements in progressions exist between the treating 
institution s and the central radiology review to make such an analys is meaningful.     
 
 
 Correlative Studies  
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters will be performed to define 
systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK 
parameters will be summarized with simple summary  statistics, including means, medians, 
ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).   
 
A descriptive analysis of the exploratory aims described in Section 1.3  will be performed 
and will be summarized with simple summary statistics. All of these analyses will be 
descriptive in nature.

12.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  v5.0 (CTCAE)  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the current version of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  v.5.0 (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE 
reporting.   All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the curren t 
CTCAEv 5.0.  A copy of the CTCAEv 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .). 
 
 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival ( PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of subprotocol 
treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Development  of new disea se or progression in any established lesions is considered 
progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions 
show opposite responses, the progressive disease takes precedence.  
 
 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tu mors  
See the table in Section 8.0  for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to t he 
scheduled scans, a confirmat ory scan should be obtained on the next consecutive cycle  
following init ial documentation of objective response.  
 
As outlined, patients will be assigned to one of the following categories for assessment of 
response:  a) solid tumor (non-CNS) and measurable disease ( Section 12.4 ); b) 
neuroblastoma with MIBG positive lesions ( Section 12.5 ); c) CNS tumor  (Section 12. 7); 
and d)  lymphoma/hystiocytosis  (Section 12. 8). Note: Neuroblastoma patients who do not 
have MIBG positive lesions should be assessed for response as solid tumor patients with 
measurable disease .  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response

Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228 -
247, 2009].  Key points are that [ADDRESS_522727]  
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of 
malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria.  
 
 Definitions   
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response :  
Eligible patients who receive  at least on e dose of protocol therapy will 
be considered evaluable for response. Evaluable patients who 
demonstrate a complete or partial response confirmed by [CONTACT_414577] -protocol anti -cancer therapy will be considered a 
responder. All other evaluable patients will be considered non -
responders  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response : 
  Eligible patients who  have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable  
but do not meet the definitions  of measurable disease  and have received 
at least one dose of protocol therapy  will be considered evaluable for  
non-target disease  response.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.   
 
 
 Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_522728] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_522729] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_522730] be 
recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
might or might not be considered measurable. If the investigator 
thinks it appropriate to include the m, the conditions under which 
such lesions should be considered must be defined in the 
protocol.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_522731] scan ( CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥ 10 to <  15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable 
disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericar dial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 41 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
simple cysts should n ot be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measu rability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, r epresentative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs,  but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion that can b e measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in th e sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The 
baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in  rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions :  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_99238], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 42 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
[IP_ADDRESS] Conventional CT and MR I:  This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_522732] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion shou ld be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of i dentical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  
If markers are initially abov e the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
 Cytology should be obtained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or  
stable disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression 
(particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression o ccurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this  is not PD.

Page 43 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
For patients with a positive PET scan at diagnosis, PET can be used to 
follow response in addition to a CT scan using the International Pediatric 
non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Response Criteria .43 
 
 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 
 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <[ADDRESS_522733] be detected by [CONTACT_6777].  
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevate d at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in th e sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline 
sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of a t least 5 mm.  
(Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered progressions). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but 
unequivocal progression in non -target or non -
measurable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overal l level of substantial worsening in non -
target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify  for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study  
 
 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm

short axis)  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion statu s.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.

 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in Section 
12.[ADDRESS_522734] show viable neuroblastoma.  
 
 The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Partial Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive 
lesions  
Progressive disease : Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
 The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2  for details on transferring images to the 
Imaging Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 46 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra -osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  
1 = 1 site per segment,   
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:  
 
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_414578] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely  resolved.  
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6713], no tumor cells can be detected by [CONTACT_6783][INVESTIGATOR_6714] 21 
days apart to be considered a Complete Response . 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced).  
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduce d). 
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.

 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Section 12.9 . 
 
 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
 Bone Marrow Involvement  
Note: patients with bone marrow as the ONLY site of disease are not eligible for 
this study. Response criteria in this section are intended to be used when assessing 
marrow involvement as a component of overall response.  
 
Histologic analysis at the local institution of marrow tumor cell involvement is 
required for patients with a history of marrow involvement. Marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6715] 2 cycles thereafter. Note: If 
progressive dise ase is documented by [CONTACT_414579], then a repeat BM is not needed to confirm PD.  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_522736] 21 days  apart. Normalization of urinary 
catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at 
study enrollment.  
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_414580] a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND 
a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% 
tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient enteri ng with 
30% tumor must increase to > 60%).  
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma 
in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if 
tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_522737] 21 days  apart . 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 48 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
Stable Disease : Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive 
disease.  
 
 Overall Best Response Assessment  
Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as  described in Section 12.[ADDRESS_522738] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If 
multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for  
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the 
thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm  lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
Any change in size of non -target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
 Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
Response criteria are assessed based on the product of the longest diameter and its 
longest per pendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any 
established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in 
other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes preced ence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Off all steroids 
with stable or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the 
initial baseline measurements ; on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids with 
a stable or improving neurologic examinati on. 
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 49 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD ; on a stable or 
decreasing dose  of steroids with a stable or improving neurologic examination.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the  sum of the products 
of the  perpendicular diameters of the target lesion s, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of the product s observed s ince the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
 Increasing doses of corticosteroids required to maintain stable neurological status 
should be strongly considered as a sign of clinical progression unless in the context 
of recent wean or transient neurologic change due e.g. to radiation effects . 
 
 Response Criteria for Non -Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non -target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
 
 Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
 Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The 
overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new lesions in the preceding 
columns.

 Response Criteria for Patients with Lymphoma/Histiocytosis  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_6788] -Hodgkin 
Lymphoma Criteria43, with modification from the Lugano classification.44 
 
 Disease Parameters  
 
1. Measurable disease : A measura ble node must have an LDi (longest diameter) 
greater than 1.[ADDRESS_522739] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal 
fractions of centimeters).  
 
2. Non-measured disease : Al l other lesions (including nodal, extranodal, and 
assessable disease) should be followed as nonmeasured disease (e.g., cutaneous, 
GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites).    
 
3. Target lesions : For patients staged with CT, up to six of the largest target nodes, 
nodal masses, or other lymphomatous lesions that are measurable in two diameters 
(longest diameter [LDi] and shortest diameter) should be identified from different 
body regions representative of the patient’s over all disease burden and include 
mediastinal and retroperitoneal disease, if involved.  
 
 Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all disease.  CT or MRI should be free of residual mass or 
evidence of new disease. FDG -PET should be negative.  
 
Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu)  
Residual mass is negative by [CONTACT_6789] -PET; no new lesions by [CONTACT_6790]; 
no new and/or progressive disease elsewhere  
 
Partial Response (PR)  
50% decrease in SPD (the sum of the products of the largest diameter and the 
perpendicular diameter for a tumor mass) on CT or MRI; FDG -PET may be 
positive (Deauville score or 4 or 5 with reduced lesional uptake compared with 
baseli ne); no new and/or PD; morphologic evidence of disease may be present in 
BM if present at diagnosis; however, there should be 50% reduction in percentage 
of lymphoma cells . 
 
No Response (Stable Disease)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor su fficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
Progressive disease  
For those with > 25% increase in SPD on CT or MRI, Deauville score 4 or 5 on 
FDG -PET with increase in lesional uptake from baseline, or  development of new 
morphologic evidence of disease in BM   
 
 Evaluation of Non -measured Lesions (CT -based response, PET/CT based

response not applicable)44 
 
Complete Response (CR) : Absent non -measured lesions.  
 
Partial response (PR) : Absent/normal, regressed, lesions, but no increase.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : No increase consistent with progression  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : New or clear progression of preexisting 
non-measured lesions.  
 
 Evaluation of organ enlargement44  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Regress to normal  
 
Partial response (PR) : Spleen must have regressed by >50% in length 
beyond normal  
 
Stable Disease (SD):  No increase consistent with progression  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : In the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length 
must increase by 50% of the extent of its prior 
increase beyond baseline. If no prior splenomegaly, 
must increase by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_522740] a 3-week  time period, are required to determine the 
patient’s overall best response. Two objective status determinations of CR before 
progression a re required for best response of CR. Two determinations of PR or better 
before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are required for a best response of PR. 
Two determinations of stable/no response or better before progression, but not qualifying 
as CR  or PR, are required for a best response of stable/no response; if the first objective 
status is unknown, only one such determination is required. Patients with an objective 
status of progression on or before the second evaluations (the first evaluation is  the first 
radiographic evaluation after treatment has been administered) will have a best response of 
progressive disease. Best response is unknown if the patient does not qualify for a best 
response of progressive disease and if all objective statuses af ter the first determination and 
before progression are unknown.  
 
 
 Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times 
during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms  
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information 
about expedited reporting.  
 
 
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade  (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6716].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
 Expedited Reporting Requirements  – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 53 
Version Date: 11/ 30/[ADDRESS_522742] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414551] (for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718].  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal li fe functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
 Reporting Requirements  - Investigator Responsibility  
Clinical investigat ors in the treating institutions and u ltimately the Study Chair 
have the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and 
assignment of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention.  It is the 
responsibility of the  treating physician to supply the medical docum entation 
needed to support the expedited AE reports in a timely manner.  
 
Any medical documentation su pporting an expedited report (eg , H &  P, 
admission and/or notes, consultations, ECG results, etc.) MUST be faxed 
within 48 -72 hours to the NCI. NOTE: Engl ish is required  for supporting 
documentation submitted to the numbers listed below in order for the NCI to 
meet the regulatory reporting timelines.  
 
Fax supporting documentation for AEs related to investigational agents 
supplied under a CTEP IND to: ([PHONE_8612]) .  
 
Also: Fax or email supporting documentation to COG for all IND studies ( Fax# 
([PHONE_8613] ; email: [EMAIL_5776] ; Attention: 
COG AERS Coordinator).  
 
• ALWAYS include the  ticket number on all faxed documents.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID 
provided during trial registration on all reports.  
 
 CTEP -AERS Expedited Reporting Methods  
Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home pag e  
https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task .

ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed and emailed documents . 
 
 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify  the type of adverse event using the  current version  5.[ADDRESS_522743] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 
5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web 
site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAEv 5.0. 
 
Step 3:  Review Table A  in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol -specific requirements for  expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements.   
 
• Any medical event equivalent to CTCAEv 5.0 grade 3, 4, or 5 that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_6719]  (or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) must be rep orted regardless 
of attribution and design ation as expected or unexpected with the exception of any 
events identified as proto col-specific expedited  adverse  event  reporting  exclusions.  
 
• Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital 
anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via CTEP -AERS  if the event occurs 
following treatment with an agent under a CTEP IND.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports.  
 
• As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that 
resolves and then recurs during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS 
reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6720].  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via 
the web at http://ctep.cancer.gov (telephone CTEP at: [PHONE_101]  within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -Hour Notification web -based 
application is unavailable) . Once internet connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_522744] be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by [CONTACT_6793].  
 
• When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A).

 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG case report  
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
 If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the 
most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
 If an adverse event progresses through several grades during one course of 
therapy, only the most severe grade should be reported.  
 
 The duration of the AE is defined as the duration of the highest (most severe) 
grade of the Adverse Eff ects.  
 
 The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the AE returns to 
baseline  or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher  (note that the 
resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the 
AE decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 57 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
resolution date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
 An adverse event that persists from one course to another should only be reported 
once unless the grade becomes more severe in a subsequent course. An adverse 
event which resolves and then recurs during a different course, must be reported 
each course it recurs.  
 
 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_414553] -AERS  reporting ( Section 13.2 ) 
should be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF  
packet (See Section 14.1 ). 
 
 Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the 
local policy and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for 
oversight of the patient.  
 
 Specific Examples for Expedited Reporting  
 
 Reportable Categories of Death  
• Death attributable to a CTCAEv 5.0 term.  
• Death Neonatal: “Newborn deaths occurring during the first 28 days after 
birth ” 
• Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of s ymptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed 
to a CTCAE v5.0 term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE v5.0 term 
associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease shou ld be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease 
progression ” under the system organ class (SOC) of “General disorders and 
administration site conditions .” Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease ( e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or 
progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be 
submitted.  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_522748] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours.  
 
• Any death that occurs more than [ADDRESS_522749] dose of treatment with 
an investigational agent which can be attributed (possibly, probably, or 
definitely) to the agent and is not clearly due to progressive disease must be 
reported via CTEP -AERS per the timelines outlined in the table above.  
 
 Reporting Secondary Malignancy  
 
Secondary Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy 
(e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 58 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the 
initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS . Three options are 
availabl e to describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  (e.g., acute 
myelocytic leukemia [AML])   
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS)   
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including  AML/MDS) 
should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each 
protocol.  
 
Second Malignancy:  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or 
“Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form , available at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf, needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical informati on to (301) 230 -0159 . The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” 
section of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure o f the fetus to 
agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs to be reported in 
an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS  as Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy )” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium 
and perinat al conditions ” SOC . 
 
• Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome  of the pregnancy  is 
known  at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795].  The “Pregnancy 
Information Form” should be used for all necessary follow -ups. This form 
is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment /electronic
_applications/docs/Pregna ncyReportForm.pdf . If the baby [CONTACT_170727] a 
birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is required.  
 
Pregnancy Loss ( Fetal Death ) 
Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.”  
 
Any pregnancy loss needs to be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy loss”  under the “ Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC . Do NOT report a pregnancy loss  as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY . APEC1621I  
Page 59 
Version Date: 11/ 30/2021  
Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE v5.0 as “Newborn deaths occurring during the 
first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by [CONTACT_414582]/intervention, should be reported expeditiously , as 
Grade 4 “Death Neonatal ” under the system organ class (SOC) of “ General 
disorders and administration site conditions.” When the death is the result of a 
patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do NOT report 
a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of 
men on study  as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS  recognizes any Grade 5 event 
as a patient death.

This study will be monitored in accordance with the Children’s Oncology Group 
policy for data and safety monitoring of Phase [ADDRESS_522753] the interests of 
patients and the  scientific integrity for all Phase 1 and 2 studies. The DSMC 
consists of a chair; a statistician external to COG; one external member; one 
consumer representative; the lead statistician of the developmental therapy 
scientific committee; and a member from the NCI. The DSMC meets at least every 
6 months to review current study results, as well as data available to the DSMC 
from other related studies. Approximately 6 weeks before each meeting of the 
Phase 1 and 2 DSMC, study chairs will be responsible for wor king with the study 
statistician to prepare study reports for review by [CONTACT_6802]. The DSMC will 
provide recommendations to the COG Developmental Therapeutics Chair and the 
Group Chair for each study reviewed to change the study or to continue the study 
unchanged. Data and Safety Committee reports for institutional review boards can 
be prepared using the public data monitoring report as posted on the COG Web 
site.

APPENDIX IX APEC1621I YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY A PEC1621 I 
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age)  
 
We want to tell you all about this study. You and your family can decide if you want to be in it. 
Ask questions if you don’t understand.  
 
1. What is the name [INVESTIGATOR_7966]?  A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) 
in children with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
2. Who is in charge of the study?  The study is being done by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group  and is 
being done at other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 
3. What is the study about?  We are asking you to  take part in a research study because other 
treatments did not get rid of the cancer.  A research study is when doctors work together to try out 
new ways to help people who are sick.  In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to 
treat the kind of cancer you have.  
 
4. What will happen to me in the study? Children who are part of this study have been “matched” to 
a medicine. We think that this medicine will help you and other kids that have the same kind of 
cancer as you have. If you deci de to be treated with this medicine, you will  have some tests and 
check -ups done more often  than if you weren’t part of this  study. We will  follow your health  after 
you finish the study treatment . 
 
Sometimes good things can happen to people whe n they are i n a research study.  These goo d things 
are called “benefits.”  We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is for your cancer to 
stop growing, or even shrink, but we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this 
study.  
 
Some times bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These  bad things 
are called “risks.”  The risks to you from this study are that you may have more problems, or side 
effects, from a medicine used in this study. There may be risks that  we don’t know about yet.  
 
5. Do I have to be in the study?  You and y our family can choose t o be part of this study or not.  You 
and y our family can also decide to stop being in this stu dy at any time once you start. There may 
be other treatments for your illn ess that your doctor can tell you about. If you have any questions 
or don’t like what is happening, please tell your parent, the doctor or nurse.  
 
6. We are asking your permission to collect additional  tumor tissue . We want to see if there are 
ways to tell ho w the cancer will respond to treatment. These samples would be taken on tumor 
samples that we already have, so there would be no extra procedures. This would not change what 
medicines we would use to treat your tumor and would not provide any “benefits” to  you. We 
hope that it might help us learn how to better treat other children’s cancers in the future. You do 
not have to participate if you do not want to.

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY A PEC1621I  
(for teens from 13 through 17 years of age) 
A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) in children  
with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat  
 
1. What is the name [INVESTIGATOR_7966]?  A study of Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) in 
children with a cancer that has come back after treatment or is difficult to treat   
 
2.   Who is in charge of the study?  The study is being done by [CONTACT_63779]’s Oncology Group and is being

did not get rid of the cancer. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to 
help people who are sick. In this study, we are trying to learn more about how to treat the ki nd of cancer 
that you have.  
 
4.  What will happen to me on the study? Your  tumor has a mutation that matches palbociclib, and so you 
have been assigned to palbociclib . The doctors want to see if palbociclib will make children with your 
type of cancer get better.  We don’t know if palbociclib will work well to get rid of your cancer. That is 
why we are doing the study.  
 
Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is that palbociclib  may cause 
your cancer to stop growing or to shrink for a pe riod of time but we don’t know for sure if there is any 
benefit of being part of this study.  
 
Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad things are 
called “risks.” The primary risk to you from this study is  that you may have side effects,  from 
palbociclib. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks we know about from palbociclib. There may 
be other risks from palbociclib that we don’t know about  yet. 
 
5.  Will I be paid to be in this study? You will not be paid for being in this study.   
 
6. Do I have to be in the study?  You and your family can choose to be part of this study or not. You and 
your family can also decide to stop being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other 
treatments for your i llness that your doctor can tell you about. If you have any questions or don’t like 
what is happening, please tell your parent, the doctor or nurse.  
 
7.   We are asking your permission to collect additional tumor tissue. We want to see if there are ways to 
tell how the cancer will respond to treatment. These samples would be taken on tumor samples  that we 
already have, so there would be no extra procedures. This would not change what medicines we would 
use to treat your tumor and would not provide an y “benefits” to you. We hope that it might help us 
learn how to better treat other children’s cancers in the future.  You do not have to participate if you do 
not want to.

APPENDIX X CTEP AND CTSU REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy 
require all individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew their 
registration annually. To register, all individuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program 
(CTEP) Identity and Access Management (IAM) account at https:// ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam . In 
addition, persons with a registration type of Investigator (IVR), Non -Physician Investigator 
(NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6731]), or Assoc iate Plus (AP) must complete their annual registration using CTEP’s web -based 
Registration and Credential Repository (RCR) at https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr .    
 
RCR utili zes five person registration types.  
• IVR — MD, DO, or international equivalent;  
• NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6731] — advanced practice providers (e.g., NP or PA) or graduate level researchers (e.g., 
PhD);

Information for Patients, Their Caregivers, and Non -Study Healthcare Team on Possible 
Interactions with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental study 
drug, Palboci clib.  This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_29630].  This form is addressed 
to the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know : 
  
Palbociclib interacts with  certain specific enzyme(s) in your liver . The enzyme in question is [CYP3A , and 
Palbociclib is broken down by [CONTACT_414588].  
   
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached 
information card in your wallet .   
 
Palbociclib  may interact with other drugs, which  can cause side effects. For this reason, it is very important 
to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto this clinical trial.  It is also 
very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular medicines, or if you start taking a new 
medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your current medications with your doctors, 
include medicine you buy without a prescription (over -the-counter remedy), or any herbal supplements 
such as St. John’ s Wort.  It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an updated medication list with 
you. 
 
Many health care providers can write prescriptions.  You must tell all of your health care providers (doctors, 
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharm acists) you are taking part in a clinical trial.  
 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
 
Palbociclib  must be used very carefully with other medicines that use certain liver enzymes .  Before you 
enroll onto the clinical trial, your study do ctor will work with your regular health care providers to  review 
any medicines and herbal supplements that  are considered “strong inducers  or inhibitors  of CYP3A.”  
 
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may contain 
ingredients that could interact with your study drug.  Speak to your doctors or pharmacist to 
determine if there could be any side effects.  
• Avoid use of strong CYP3 A inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telaprevir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice during 
palbocicl ib treatment. Avoid use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enzalutamide, and St John's Wort).  
 
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call your 
study doctor before prescribing any new medicine or discontinuing any medicine.  Your study 
doctor’s name [CONTACT_832]  _____________________________________ and he or  she can be contact[CONTACT_6811]

➢ No grapefruit juice, Seville oranges, or grapefruit can be consumed 
while on  palbociclib . 
 
  
 Palbociclib  interacts with specific liver enzym es called CYP3A  and 
must be used very carefully with other medicines that interact with 
these enzymes.   
➢ Before you enroll onto the clinical trial , your study doctor will 
work with your regular health care providers to review  any 
medicines and herbal supplements that are cons idered “strong 
inducers  or inhibitors of CYP3A. ”  
➢ The use of p roton pump inhibitors (PPIs) must be avoided if 
possible while taking palbociclib. Y our study doctor will review any 
medicines you are taking.  
➢ Before prescribing new medicines, your regular health care 
providers should go to a frequently updated medical reference  for 
a list of drugs to avoid, or contact [CONTACT_414590].

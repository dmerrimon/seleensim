 1. Background  and Previous Human Studies  
Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface serine 
protease which cleaves a dipeptide from the N -terminus of its polypeptide substrates 
containing a proline or alanine at the second residue. Interest in this peptidase and its 
pharmacological  inhibition has arisen due to its proteolytic inactivation of the incretin 
hormones and the role this plays in glucose homeostasis. Selective DPPIV  inhibitors 
improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by [CONTACT_34032] e 
degradation of the incretin hormones glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1) and glucose -
dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) .(1;2) The DPPIV inhibitor s itagliptin was 
approved by [CONTACT_34033] [ADDRESS_33448] 
since received FDA approval: saxagliptin (2009) and linagliptin (2011). The  direct and 
indirect effects of these inhibitors on cardio vascular function  remain an active area of 
investigation.  
GLP-1 also promotes endothelium -dependent vasodilation in the human vasculature 
in subjects with type 2 diabetes and stable coronary artery disease. In addition to 
preventing the degradation of the incretin hormones,  DPPIV inhibitors prevent the 
degradation of other peptides with a  penultimate proline or alanine  including but not 
limited to the vasodilators  substance P as well as  BNP and the neurotransmitter 
neuropeptide Y. (3;4) Our group has previously demonstrated that five day treatment 
with sitagliptin  significant ly decrease d mean arterial pressure in subjec ts with metabolic 
syndrome .(5)  Others have reported that acute sitagliptin treatment reduces  24 hour 
ambulatory blood pressure in non -diabetic patients with mild to moderate 
hypertension. (6) It has  recently been demonstrated in an animal model and in vitro  that 
acute DPPIV inhibition leads to vascular relaxation via  a GLP -1 independent 
mechanism involving nitric oxide release mediated by [CONTACT_34034]. (7) 
DPPIV inhibitors could affect blood pressure and vascular function in part by [CONTACT_34035]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_34013] (GHRH) , 
also known as growth hormone -releasing factor (GRF)  is a substrate of DPPIV , which 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_34014](1 -44)-NH 2 to the biologically inactive GRF (3 -44)-NH 2 at Ala2-
Asp3.(1;2) Conversion to GRF (3 -44)-NH 2 is blocked in vitro by [CONTACT_34036] A, a DPPIV 
competitive inhibitor. (8) Human  GRF  is produced in the hypothalamus and stimulates 
the release of the growth hormone  (GH)  from somatotrope  cells within the anterior 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_304] ; the active portion of the molecule resides in the first 29 amino acid 
residues . Opposing the actions of GRF , the hypothalamic hormone somatostatin inhibits 
the release of GRF. (9) Growth hormone  circulates throughout the body exerting its 
 
9/8/16

 numerous effects both directly and indirectly via the hepatic production of insulin -like 
growth factor -1 (IGF-1). DPPIV proteolysis plays a major role in the degradation and 
inactivation  of human GRF in vivo.(2) Thus, we hypothesize that i nhibition of DPPIV will 
result in decreased GRF degradation and augmentation of the somatotropic axis  in vivo 
in humans . 
The direct vascular effects of GH and its downstream mediator IGF -1 are well -
established.  Systemic and arterial GH infusion increase s forearm blood flow in healthy 
subjects independent of systemic and local IGF -1 production. (10;11)   This vasodilation  
is reversed by [CONTACT_34037], L-N-monom ethylarginine  (L-
NMMA) .(10) Furthermore, growth hormone receptors are present  in abundance on 
human endothelial cells. Incubation of endothelial cells  with GH  in vitro  increase s the 
phosphorylation and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)  resulting in 
increased formation of nitric oxide (NO) .  NO is formed by [CONTACT_34038] (eNOS) within the endothelial cells of the vasculature and then diffuse s to 
underlying sm ooth muscle cells where it increases vasodilation  via cGMP p roduction  
and decreases inflammation and platelet aggregation .(12-14) Growth hormone 
treatment also contributes to vascular integrity by [CONTACT_34039] -mediated mobilization 
of endothelial progenitor cells in healthy individuals. (15;16)  The exact mechanism(s) 
through which GH regulates eNOS remain unclear. Evidence exists for both an IGF -1 
mediated activation of eNOS involving the serine/threonine Akt phosphorylation -
dependent kinase as well as a direct GH -mediated activation of both Akt and JAK -STAT 
(Janus kinase -signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathways. (17) 
Interestingly, individuals with hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_34015], despi[INVESTIGATOR_34016] .(18-20) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_34017], as compared to gender, age, and body mass index -matched 
controls. (21) Several prospective studies in adults with hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_34018], intima -media thickness, 
endothelial function, and vascular reactivity as well as various biochemical markers of 
cardiovascular and metabolic disease including fat distribution and inflammatory 
cytokines. (22-27) Furthermore , GH deficient adults exhibit low levels  of metabolites of 
systemic NO production; and GH replacement therapy normalizes biomarkers of 
NO.(16;28;29)   Many of the adverse cardiovascular factors observed in GH deficient 
individuals  are accordingly attributed to inadequate vascular NO bioavailability which 
can be reversed with GH treatm ent.

 Patients with the cardiovascular risk factors of hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], 
diabetes mellitus or tobacco use demonstrate endothelial dysfunction characterized by 
[CONTACT_34040]. (14) Basal NO -
mediated dilata tion in the forearm arterial bed of patients with insulin -dependent 
diabetes is impaired as assessed by [CONTACT_34041]. (30) The 
impairment in endothelial function in experimental animals and humans with diabetes 
mellitus is attributed to reduced NOS activity and/or NO availability as well as the 
accompanying increased production of reactive oxygen species. This char acteristic 
endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular 
disease. (31)  
This aim promises to provide important new data regarding how DPPIV inhibition 
affects the somatotropic axis  in healthy adults .  Given the known effects that growth 
hormone and IGF -[ADDRESS_33449] vascular function  
in the diabetic population . None of our currently available anti -glycem ic agents offer this 
benefit. Data from the Framingham Heart Study demonstrates a negative correlation 
between  circulating IGF -1 and insulin resistance  in a community based sample .(32) 
GRF -induced GH secretion is  blunted in premenopausal women with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_34019]. (33) Thus derangements in the somatotropic axis have previously 
been described in individuals at risk for the development of diabetes.  
Adults with diabetes demonstrate heart disease death rates two to four times higher 
than adults without diabetes (“Diabetes Statistics” American Diabetes Association; 
www.diabetes.org ); thus DPPIV inhibitors may potentially represent a novel therapy that 
is simultaneously able to confer both a glycemic and vascular benefit in this at -risk 
population.  We therefore expect that  findings from this study will lead to further 
investigations reg arding currently unrecognized but significant vascular effects of this 
relatively new class of medications increasingly used in the diabetic population.  
2. Rationale and Specific Aims  
This study tests the hypothesis that DPPIV inhibition will favorably augment the 
somatotropic axis  in healthy individuals  by [CONTACT_34042] G RF by 
[CONTACT_34043].  This study specifically  establishes the effect of acute DPP4 inhibition on 
arginine -stimulated GH secretion and GH -mediated blood flow in healthy humans . 
Arginine decreases inhibitory hypothalamic somatostatin secretion, allowing the primary 
stimulus of GH secretion to be GHRH.  We will study healthy adults to obtain maximal 
GH signal in this proof -of-concept initial aim, given that obesity diminishes the G H 
response to pharmacologic stimuli.

5. Study Procedures  
 
 
 
The figure above  illustrates the  Aim 1A  study protocol  for Groups A  and C (Group B 
has completed Aim 1A) .  Each subject will undergo  two study days separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
a 2 week  wash -out.  Seventy -two hours prior to each study day, subjects will start once 
daily study drug (sitagliptin 100 mg by [CONTACT_34047]), following a negative 
pregnancy test obtained in the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC), as 
applicable.  This duration and dos e of sitagliptin was chosen to achieve steady -state 
with significant inhibition of DPP4 activity. (34) On each day, subjects will report to the 
Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC) in the morning after an overnight fast  and 
having abstained from exercise that morning .  Subjects will be studied in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_34020] a temperature -controlled room. All subjects will receive a peripheral venous 

 
9/8/16  
10 
 catheter in the non -dominant arm for infusion of arginine as well as a peripheral venous 
catheter in the contra -lateral arm for repeated blood sampling. Normal saline will be 
infused into the catheter in the non -dominant arm prior to arginine administration for 
purposes of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_34021]. Subjects will then be given their 4th dose of study 
drug. One hour after administration of study drug  we will measure baseline forearm 
blood flow (FBF, see below) and obta in baseline ven ous blood samples (see below). 
We will infuse a rginine (30 grams ) intravenously over [ADDRESS_33453] chosen this 
dose of arginine , previously used in the clinical setting to diagnose GH deficiency, to 
yield a peak plasma GH level of 10 ng/mL 30minutes after completion of arginine 
infusion. (35;36)  .  Immediately following arginine administration we  will repeat 
measurement s of forearm blood flow  every 30 minutes  and venous blood sampling  
every 15 minutes up to 150 minutes after arginine infusion . The protocol will be 
repeated following a 2 -week washout  using the opposite  study drug (s itagliptin or 
matching placebo).  Both blood pressure and heart rate will be continuously monitored 
throughout each study day.  At the completion of each study day subjects will be fed 
lunch prior to discharge from the CRC.  
 
 
9/8/[ADDRESS_33454] of sitagliptin on FBF is observed, 
subjects will be invited to return for 2 additional study visits (Study Visits 3 and 4) in 
order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the increase in FBF . Study Visit [ADDRESS_33455] vs. placebo (see previous table) on each study days. In 
Group B , DPP4 inhibition will be given as a single oral dose (sitagliptin 200 mg) on 
each study day; a minimum of 4 weeks will separate study days. In Groups A and C , 
DPP4 inhibition will be given as 100 mg sitagliptin by [CONTACT_34048], starting 72 hours prior 
to each study day with the 4th dose given on the study day; a minimum two -week 
washout will separate study days . Venous sampling will occur following assessment of 
forearm blood flow .  All other study procedures will take place as previously described.  
Details regarding the dose and administration of each antagonist are provided below.   
Forearm Blood Flow Measurements  
FBF will be measured using mercury -in-silastic strain -gauge plethysmography. The 
wrist is supported in a sling to raise the level of the forearm to above the level of the 

 
9/8/[ADDRESS_33456] part of the forearm.  The strain gauge 
is connected to a plethysmograph (model EC -4, D.E. Hokanson, Issaquah, WA), 
calibrated to measure the percent change in volume and connected to a chart recorder 
to record flow measurements.  For each measurement, a cuff placed around the upper 
arm is inflated to 40 mmHg with a rapid cuff inflator (model E -10, Hokanson) to occlude 
venous outflow from the extremity.  The hand is excluded from the measurement of 
blood flow by [CONTACT_16131] a pediatric sphygmomanometer cuff to [ADDRESS_33457] during measurement of FBF.  Flow measurements are recorded for approximately 
7 secs/[ADDRESS_33458] 3 -4 pulses; [ADDRESS_33459]  (pegvisomant 80 mg given subcutaneous ly 72 
hours prior to each study day in Aim 1B) was chosen as 80 mg of pegvisomant 
produces maximal drug levels 72 hours following administration and a reduction in free 
IGF-1 comparable to that observed in GH deficiency, thus indicative of efficient GH 
recep tor blockade and a state of acute GH deficiency. (37;38)  Pegvisomant is a GH 
analog that disables signal transduction through the GH receptor and thereby [CONTACT_34049] a receptor antagonist. This selective blockade allows us to examine th e effects of GH 
secretion in the absence of cofounders such as changes in IGF -[ADDRESS_33460] of GH secretion on 
cardiovascular risk markers. (37-39) 
The dose of GLP -[ADDRESS_33461] (Exendin -(9-39) IV bolus of 7500 pmol/kg 
over 1 minute at time 0 (Aim 1B) followed by [CONTACT_34050] 750 pmol/kg/min 
for 150 minutes) was chosen as this dose elicits blockade of GLP -[ADDRESS_33462] -prandial GLP -1 secretion. (40-
 
9/8/16  
13 
 42)The timing of Exendin -(9-39) infusion may be adjusted pending results of Aim1A 
to coincide with the timing of peak FBF response.  
 
The dose and timing of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L -NMMA  (3mg/kg priming 
IV infusion over 15 minutes given prior to Arginine infusion in  Aim 1B  and then 
continued at 6 mg/kg over an additional 120 minutes ) has been selected to achieve 
peak hemodynamic response  15 minutes after priming dose and maintain 
hemodynamic effects for u p to one hour after completion of infusion .(43;44)  Doses up 
to 13.5  mg/kg IV ha ve safely been given to healthy adults . (44-46)  The elimination 
half-life of L -NMMA is approximately 60 minutes. (43) Co-infusion of a total dose of 6.5 
mg/kg L -NMMA with L -arginine has not been shown to influence L -arginine -stimulated 
GH secretion. (47)  
 
 
6. Risks  
1. Repeated blood sampling from venous catheters may cause bleeding or 
infection.   
2. Frequent blood draws can cause anemia.  
3. Insertion of venous catheters may cause bleeding, bruising, or infection.  
 
4. Arginine has previously been used to diagnose growth hormone  deficiency (IV, 
30 grams). (36) After comp letion of infusion, L -arginine plasma concentration 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_34022] 30 minutes to 47% of the maximum level. (43) 
Possible side effects include flushing, nausea and vomiting, headache,  
numbness and  local venous irritation.   Rarely, a burn -like reaction or injury to 
the skin requiring surgery has been reported. Rarely, allergic reaction has 
been reported.  
5. Sitagliptin  - Drugs like sitagliptin can cause lowered blood sug ar (common)  in 
individuals with high blood sugar (diabetes) . This can result in dizziness, 
nausea, shaking, sweating, fast heartbeat, vision changes, headache, anxiety, 
tiredness, or confusion. It can rarely cause fainting, seizures, or coma. Other 
side ef fects are pancreatitis (damage to the pancreas), kidney damage (which 
can be life threatening), allergic reaction (which can be life threatening), rash, 
and liver damage (which can be life threatening).  The FDA is warning that 
dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors such as sitagliptin, saxagliptin, 
linagliptin, and alogliptin may cause joint pain that can be severe and 
 
9/8/[ADDRESS_33463]  (Pegvisomant 80 mg given  
subcutaneously  72 hours prior to each study day in Aim 1B , Group B only ) was 
chosen as 80 mg of pegvisomant produces maximal drug levels 72 hours 
following administration and a reduction in free IGF -1 comparable to that 
observed in GH deficiency, thus indicative of efficient GH receptor blockade 
and a state of acute GH deficiency. (37;38)  Pegvisomant is a GH analog that 
disables signal transduction through the GH receptor and thereby [CONTACT_34051] 
a receptor antagonist. This selective blockade allows us to examine the effects 
of GH secretion in the absence of cofounders s uch as changes in IGF -[ADDRESS_33464] of GH secretion on cardiovascular risk markers. (37-39) 
Side effects in patients taking this medication on a daily basis may include 
pain and reaction  at the injection site, flu -like symptoms, nausea, and diarrhea 
(common). Rarely, swelling, dizziness, sinusitis and elevations in liver tests 
have been reported with  repeated use.  
 
 
7. Exendin -(9-39) (IND ) -is an investigational agent (Clinalfa®, Bachem 
Distribution Services; Weil am Rhein, [LOCATION_013]) that will be infused 
intravenously following dissolution in 0.25% human serum albumin. Salehi et. 
al. have not experienced any untoward effects with the use of this antagonist 
in healthy participants, those  with Type 2 diabetes mellitus, or history of 
gastric by[CONTACT_6476]. (40;42;48)  Deane et. al . reported that blockade of GLP -1 
action was associated with accelerated gastric emptying and larger glucose 
excursions in the hour following meal intake (49). The dose of GLP -[ADDRESS_33465]  (Exendin -(9-39) IV bolus of 7500 pmol/kg over 1 minute at Time 0 
(Aim 1B) followed by [CONTACT_34050] 750 pmol/kg/min for 150 minutes) 
was chosen as this dose elicits blockade of GLP -[ADDRESS_33466] -prandial GLP -1 secretion. (40-42) 
The timing of Exendin -(9-39) infusion may be adjusted pending results of 
Aim1A to coincide with the timing of peak FBF response.  
8. L-NG-monomethyl arginine citrate (L -NMMA) (IND # ) - is an 
investigational agent (Clinalfa®, Bachem Distribution Services; Weil am Rhein, 
[LOCATION_013]) that will be infused intravenously. Side effects of systemic 

 
9/8/16

 administration include increase in blood pressure and decrease in heart rate. 
(3mg/kg priming IV infusion over 15 minutes given prior to Arginine infusion in  
Aim 1B  and then continued at 6 mg/kg over an additional 120 minutes ) has 
been selected to achieve peak hemodynamic response  15 minutes after 
priming dose and maintain hemodynamic effects for u p to one hour after 
completion of infusion . (43;44) The elimination half -life of L -NMMA is 
approximately 60 minutes. (43) Co-infusion of a total dose of 6.5 mg/kg L -
NMMA with L -arginine has not been shown to influence L -arginine s timulated 
GH secretion. (47) Doses up to 13.5  mg/kg IV ha ve safely been given to 
healthy adults .(44-46) 
 
7. Reporting of Adverse Ev ents or Unanticipated Problems I nvolving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
 
.  
All adverse events and instances  of non-compliance with the protocol, subject 
withdrawals, and subject comp laints will be formally sum marized and reviewed by [CONTACT_34052] (DSMB)  bi- annually. The DSMB will receive these 
in written format and review the study for appropriate and timely subject accrua l, 
adherence to the protocol, and data accuracy  and completenes s. The DSMB will 
provide the PI ([CONTACT_34061]) with written co nfirmation of receipt of this bi-annual 
summary as  well as a  recommendation with acc ompanying rationale for study 
termination or continuation. This written confirmation will be pro vided to the IRB and 
include results of the review and concer ns, if any, regarding subject safety or study 
drug tolerability. The DSMB will ensure that all adverse event reporting to the IRB is in 
accordance with current policies. The members of the DSMB will be a vailable for 
discussion of any questions regarding pr otocol adherence, consent issues, or adverse 
events. The DSMB will review final results of the study. 
 
The DSMB is comp rised of Drs. , , , and Dr.  
(Group C only) . Dr.  is a translational researcher and has  experience with 
the use of sitagliptin to treat patients with diabetes.  Dr.  is a translational 
researcher and has experience with the administration of vasoactive subs tances.  All 
adverse events specifically related to the use of arginine and pegvisomant  will be 
graciously reviewed as they occur with Dr , who as  Director of Vanderbilt’s 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_34023].  Dr.  is a clinical 
endocrinologist and translational researcher at the University of Cincinnati who has 
experience with the infusion of exendin (9 -39) in clinical research protocols. Dr. 
 will serve as the DSMB chair.  
 
All protocols will be reviewed and appro ved by  [CONTACT_34053].  [CONTACT_34061], her mentor (Dr. ) and her c o-investigators will 

 
9/8/16

 closely oversee  the protocol. Any serious ad verse events or toxicities will be reported 
to the Vanderbilt IRB as per policy and will immediately be reviewed with the DSMB. 
Any noncompliance with the IRB-approved pro tocol that increa ses risk or affects 
participants’ rights, safety or welfare will be reported to the IRB within 10 working 
days of the investigators’ knowledge and immediately reviewed by  [CONTACT_4318]. 
 
Any untoward medical event will be c lassified as an adverse event, regardless of its 
causal relationship with the study. An adverse event will be c lassified as serious if it a) 
results in death, b)  if life-threatening, c) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], d) results in persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity, e) is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. All non -serious adverse events 
and instances of non-compliance with the protocol will be reported annually to the IRB 
at the time of continuing review .  
 
 
[CONTACT_34061] will review enrollment progress, all adverse events, protocol  adherence 
data, and data quality entry at a minimum of every two weeks with her mentor ([CONTACT_34062]. Devin will review with Dr.  each enrolled su bject’s chart 
every two weeks for side effects and tolerability of the investigational drug. These 
findings will be included in the DSMB bi-annual report unless dictated otherwise 
above. 
 
Summary Reports will be submitted to the IRB  at least annually and will contain a) the 
number of adverse events and an explanation of how each event was handled, b) the 
number of complaints and how each complaint was handled, c) the number  of subject 
withdrawals and an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was withdrawn, and d) 
the number of protocol violations (non-compliance with protocol) and how each was 
handled.  
 
 
8. Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
If at any time during the study, a subject develops any symptoms related to study 
participation that subject will be withdrawn from the study. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], a subject is non -compliant, that subject will be withdrawn from the study. 
Subjects who are withdrawn will  be followed until symptoms have resolved.  
  
9. Statistical Considerations  
 
Anticipated Results

 DPPIV cleaves GRF at its penultimate alanine. (1;2) GRF stimulates endogenous GH 
secretion, potentially leading to an increase in the GH -mediated vasodilator 
response. (10;11)  We expect that DPPIV inhibition (sitagliptin) will result in decreased 
degradation of GRF and an increase in stimulated GH secr etion. (Aim 1A)  We expect 
that this will increase forearm blood flow and that this effect will be prevented by [CONTACT_094] -
treatment with a GH receptor antagonist , but remain unaffected by [CONTACT_17814] L -
NMMA as well as GLP -[ADDRESS_33467] . (Aim 1B)   
 
Sample Size and Power Calculation  
Aim 1A.  Our preliminary data in females (N=4) demonstrate a difference in mean peak 
GH following arginine stimulation of 6.79 ng/mL (mean 14.07 ± SD 4.73 ng/mL Drug A 
vs. 20.86 ± 13.23 ng/mL Drug B). Sample size was calcul ated with PS Software using 
the design for a paired t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance level. (50) A sample size 
of [ADDRESS_33468] 80% power to detect  a difference in means of 6.79 ng/mL 
assuming a 12.25 ng/mL SD of the differences. Accounting for a 10% drop -out between 
the 2 study days, we will enroll 31 females in this study. Our preliminary data in males 
(N=2) dem onstrates a difference in mean peak GH in the opposite direction. Pre -
menopausal women are more responsive to GHRH and secrete more GH per pulse 
than men, the latter is primarily a GHRH -mediated phenomenon. (51-53) Given the 
known sexual dimorphism in pulsatile GH secretion, we have chosen to study only 
enough men to allow us to estimate the differ ence in males. Studying 11 males will 
allow a half -width of the 95% confidence for the difference to be about 7.6 ng/mL. 
Enrolling forty -four subjects (3 2 females; 1 2 males) in Aim 1A divided amongst [ADDRESS_33469] a statistically 
significant difference in FBF ( see below ). 
Aim 1B. Prior data indicates that a difference in forearm blood flow of the following is 
statistically significant p<0.001: baseline forearm blood flow mean ±SEM 4.4 ±0.2 vs 2.7  
±0.3 ml/min/100mLfollowing L -NMMA in n=59 subjects. (54) Conservatively assuming a 
correlation coefficient of 0.[ADDRESS_33470] difference would be 1.8.  Assuming , for example, that  sitagliptin+GH 
antagonist would achieve FBF of 2.7 ± 2.3  and sitagliptin+placebo would have FBF of 
4.4±1.5 (mean±SD), a sample size of [ADDRESS_33471] 80% power to 
detect this difference. Sample size was c alculated with PS Software using the design for 
a paired t -test.  Assuming a 10% drop -out in between the 2 study visits we will enroll 14 
patients  in each Group; gender distribution of the groups will be determin ed by [CONTACT_34054] 1A .

Data Analys is Plan  
The primary endpoints are:  
Aim 1A : Peak GH level following Arginine stimulation, assessed in a paired manner 
with and without sitagliptin.  
Aim 1B : Repeated measurements of FBF following sitagliptin at the specified times will 
be assessed in a paired manner with and without antagonist . 
 
Even though we do not expect any carry -over effect in this [ADDRESS_33472]. (55)  Mixe d effect models will be used to analyze the data with a random 
subject effect and with the treatment (sitagliptin vs placebo or sitagliptin+GH antagonist 
vs sitagliptin+placebo) and the time trend as measured at the above time points as fixed 
effects.  The  focus of this study will be the treatment effect and the time trend of the 
endpoints; however, mixed effect models also provide the flexibility of controlling for and 
evaluating covariates as needed by [CONTACT_1758].  The mixed effect models are robust in 
the sense that they can include subjects with missing data at some time points but not 
all time points to estimate the effects of interest. The above specifies the general model 
for most of the endpoints, however, there will be no time trend in the model for peak GH 
level.   Besides the above evaluation of the treatment effect and the time trend through 
the regression models, specific inferences regarding effects of interest will be made by 
[CONTACT_34055] a point estimate along with a 95% confidence interval. Hypot heses will be 
tested at the level of α=0.05. This data analysis plan will be carried out using statistical 
software SPSS for Windows (Version 19.0, SPSS, Chicago) and the open source 
statistical package R (version 2.12, R Development Core Team, 2006 ).  
10. Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Clinical data, including clinical laboratory, will be entered by a member of the Key Study 
Personnel in a protected source database  (RedCap) .  A unique identification case 
number will be used to protect the confidentiality of t he study participants.  The case 
numbers and participants' names will be included in the protected source database, 
accessible only by [CONTACT_34056], but only case numbers will be included in any 
spreadsheet used for the statistical analysis.

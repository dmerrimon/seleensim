INTEGRA: A Vanguard Study of Health Service Delivery in a Mobile Health 
Delivery Unit  to Link Persons who Inject Drugs to Integrated Care and Prevention 
for Addiction, HIV, HCV and Primary Care  
 
 
SCHEMA  
 
Purpose:  
 The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of using a mobile 
health delivery unit  (“mobile unit”)  to deliver “one stop” integrated 
health services  – particularly medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD) 
and medication for HIV treatment and prevention – to people who inject 
drugs (PWID) with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] ( OUD ) to improve uptake and use 
of MOUD , and uptake and use of  antiretroviral therapy (ART) or pre -
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) . The intervention  arm receiving health  
services in the mobile unit  will be supported by [CONTACT_578950] . An 
active control arm  will receive peer navigation  to health services 
available at community -based agencies . Impact (cost -effectiveness, 
mathematical modeling) and implementation factors  (mixed methods to 
identify barriers and facilitators of the interventions) will contextualize 
findings from the efficacy analysis . The impact of the COVID -19 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_578879].  
 
Design:  
 A two -arm, individually randomized, controlled , open label  study  
 
Population:  
 People living  with and witho ut HIV and who inject drugs, have OUD , 
and are  not receiving MOUD   
 
Study Size:  
 A total of 450 participants  allotted in a 1:1 ratio  to intervention and active 
control arm s, with target s of a minimum 25% women  and 25% 
participants under 30 years of age , and 10% people li ving with HIV at 
enrollment . 
 
Study 
Duration:  
 Approximately three and a half years total with individual participants o n 
study for approximately 52 weeks  ([ADDRESS_760645] at the end 
of 52 weeks ). 
 
Study Sites:  
 Five u rban sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) with substantial populations of 
PWID with OUD . See the Study Specific  Procedures ( SSP) Manual for 
site listing.  
 
Study 
Regimen:  
 All potential study participants will provide biological samples and self -
report ed data via interview  in the mobile unit at Screening  and Enrollment 
Visits. Samples  will be tested for HIV, hepatitis A  (HAV) , B (HBV) and C 
(HCV) and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs). At the Enrollment Visit, 
participants who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be 
randomized to the intervention or active control arm  and will receive 
harm reduction services and empi[INVESTIGATOR_578880] . 
Participants will also be assessed for COVID -19 at study visits; participants 
   
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  12 of 99 
20 February 2023  with suspected COVID -19 or recent exposure will be referred for further 
evaluation, care and/or treatment, as available.  
 
Intervention Arm : Participants in the intervention arm will be provided 
integrated health services  delivered in the mobile unit and peer navigation 
for 26 weeks . The integrated health services  in the mobile  unit will include:  
• MOUD and harm reduction services for OUD  
• HIV testing  
• HIV treatment for people living with HIV not already in care  
• PrEP for people without HIV 
• Testing and referral for vaccination or treatment for HAV and 
HBV 
• Testing and  referral for treatment  for HCV 
• STI testing and treatment  
• Primary care  
• Harm reduction services  
 
Peer navigation in the intervention  arm will coordinate and facilitate 
integrated care in the mobile unit  through  26 weeks . As participants 
become established in care, navigation will help transition participants to 
community -based services  by 26 weeks after randomization.  
 
Active Control Arm : Participants in the active control arm  will be provided 
[ADDRESS_760646]  them to health services available at 
community -based agencies .  
 
All participants (both arms) will have study visits at 26 and 52 weeks for 
evaluation of study endpoints.  
 
Primary 
Objective:  
 To evaluate whether 26 weeks of “one stop” integrated health services  
delivered in a mobile unit, supported by [CONTACT_578950] , improves use of 
MOUD  and increases use of PrEP among people without HIV, as 
measured at 26 weeks , when compared to 26 weeks of peer navigation to 
similar  health services available at community -based agencies . 
 
Secondary 
Objectives:  
 1) To evaluate whether 26 weeks of “one stop” integrated health services 
delivered in a mobile unit, supported by [CONTACT_578950] , compared to 
26 weeks of peer navigation  to similar health services available at 
community -based agencies : 
a) improves use of MOUD at 52 weeks  
b) increases rates of viral suppression among people living with 
HIV at 52 weeks  
c) increases use of PrEP among people without HIV at 26 and 52 
weeks  
d) decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_578881] 26 and 52 weeks  
e) decreases prevalence of bacterial STIs at 26 and 52 weeks  
f) decreases fatal and non -fatal overdose events by 26 and 52 
weeks  
   
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  13 of 99 
20 February 2023  g) increase s the proportion of participants with undetectable HCV 
RNA at 26 and 52 weeks among those with chronic HCV 
infection at enrollment  
h) decreases HCV incidence at 52 weeks, for those who are HCV  
negative at enrollment  
i) increases rates of viral suppression among people living with 
HIV as measured at 26 weeks  
 
2) To evaluate whether 26 weeks of “one stop” integrated health 
services delivered in a mobile unit, supported by [CONTACT_578950], 
increases MOUD use, viral suppression , and PrEP use at 26 and 52 
weeks compared to Enrollment  
 
3) To evaluate whether 26 weeks of peer navigation to similar health 
services available at community -based agencies increases MOUD 
use, viral suppression, and PrEP use at 26 and 52 weeks compared to 
Enrollment  
 
4) To document the prevalence  of seropositivity for  SARS -CoV -2 at 
baseline, 26 and 52 weeks  
 
5) To document the impact of the COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_578882]’ 
experience s of seeking, obtaining and /or maintaining health services, 
housing , food security  and drugs  
    
6) To evaluate implementation  of “one -stop” integrated health services  
using a mobile unit, supported by [CONTACT_578950] , across study sites 
to identify mechanisms at multiple levels to: 
a) Guide  real-time improvements  and refinements  in the 
conduct of the study to ensure primary and secondary 
outcomes are met  with fidelity  
b) Examine  the quality and process of services delivered in  each 
study arm, particularly as  these affect primary and 
secondary  outcomes  
c) Develop evidence -based guidance for policymakers on the 
uptake and implementation of integrated health services 
using peer navigation and mobile health units in urban US 
regions to address HIV prevention in PWID  
d) Identify factors that enhance or impede the delivery of  
integrated health services using a mobile unit, supported by 
[CONTACT_578951], on primary and secondary outcomes, 
including responding to the impact of COVID -19 on service 
delivery  
 
7) To use mathematical modeling methods to:  
a) Estimate the effect of integrated health services delivered in a 
mobile unit, supported by [CONTACT_578950], on reducing HIV 
incidence in PWID and their sexual and injection partners  
b) Estimate the cost -effectiveness of the integrated health services 
provided in a mobile unit and supported by [CONTACT_578952] 094, Final Version 2.0  14 of 99 
20 February 2023   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Process 
Objectives : For participants in the intervention arm , assess : 
 
1) Time to provide  MOUD treatment, ART  (among those who are living 
with HIV and not on ART at Enrollment ) and PrEP (among those  who 
are without HIV at Enrollment )  
2) The proportion of partici pants linked to community -based  MOUD, 
ART and PrEP services at 26 weeks  
 
Exploratory 
Objective s: 
 Stored samples may be used to  analyze HIV subtypes/strains, HIV drug 
resistance, and the duration of HIV infection. Phylogenetic methods may 
be used to evaluate behavioral, demographic, and clinical factors associated

used to characterize HCV strains and the relationship between HIV and 
HCV infections , and to explore issues related to COVID -19.

20 February 2023  1. INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background and Rationale  
 
Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the [LOCATION_002]  (US), with  over 
67,000 fatalities in 201 8.1 Efforts to address the opi[INVESTIGATOR_578883], though th e rate of overdose related to fentanyl use continue d to 
rise through 2018.1  The opi[INVESTIGATOR_578884]’s most widespread behavioral 
public health problem, with a higher number of deaths due to drug overdose in [ADDRESS_760647]  time in 2019 .3-5 Prog ression 
from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_578885] , though the increase has slowed .6-8 
Fentanyl and its analogues represent the “third wave” of the US opi[INVESTIGATOR_578886].1,7 Injection drug use is 
the primary driver for doubling  hepatitis C  (HCV ) incidence in the US, with several recent HCV 
outbreaks among people who inject drugs (PWID) .9-[ADDRESS_760648] surveillance reports continue to show increases in 
methamphetamine and cocaine involvement in drug overdose deaths .1 
 
Health risks for p ersons with OUD and living with or at risk for HIV in the US include multiple 
and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_578887], particularly when 
the substance use  disorder is active .15 Throughout this document  we interchangeably use the 
terms “addiction ” and " substance use disorder ” within the definition as written in the NIAID  HIV 
Language Guide: “Addiction is defined as a pattern of c ompulsive substance use —marked by a 
change in behavior caused by [CONTACT_578953] —despi[INVESTIGATOR_578888]. Addiction is not a diagnostic term but is considered synonymous 
with moderate to severe substance  use disorder .” The behaviorally disorganizing aspects of 
substance use disorder can interfere with traveling to existing services (lack of transportation), 
with willingness to tolerate judgements and attitudes from personnel in health care settings 
(stigma)  and with foregoing pleasure in lieu of healthcare (addiction) . Consequently,  persons with 
active addiction  spend large amounts of time hanging out together in “hot spots” near jails, 
criminal justice community supervision programs, syring e exchange programs (SEPs), parks and 
tourist areas. The location and size of these hot spots can vary within regions.  
 
This calls for an HIV prevention response that meets people living with  or at-risk for HIV who 
also live with OUD where they are , with the aim to reduce barriers at each step in the process of 
acces sing and sustaining medi cation for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] ( MOUD ) treatment  and HIV care and 
prevention. Moreover, there is a need to examine barriers that interfere with entry and retention in 
MOU D and with sustaining relevant HIV outcomes . This is particularly true among this 
population , many of whom face additional stigma , barriers and health disparities related to their 
multi -dimensional identities  (e.g., as sex workers, men who have sex with men (MSM) and 
polysubstance users ).15  
 
The rationale for this study is based on this premise : HIV outbreaks in the US among PWID 
occur when simultaneous factors —lack of access to health care (including MOUD), poverty , 
prevalent poly -substance use , and mental health disorders  and others —combine  to exacerbate  
HIV transmission  and acquisition . PWID living with or at risk of HIV who are not engaged in 
MOUD face the nearly impossible task of getting care from bricks and mortar clinics that provide 
separate, siloed care for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827] (methadone, buprenorphine), HIV ( antiretroviral therapy 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  17 of 99 
20 February 2023  [ART ] and pre-exposure prophylaxi s [PrEP ]) and primary care ( sexually transmitted infections 
[STI] testing and treatment, hepatitis testing and treatment, diagnosis and treatment for chronic 
and other conditions ) with limited or no financial resources . Health s ervices  to address these 
diverse problems , when they exist , are often located far away from each other and from the PWID 
who need them , presenting serious distance/travel barriers to access . The challenge of  finding and 
sustaining HIV care and prevention in the setting of untreated OUD in persons with multiple 
additional health threats contributed to multiple HIV outbreaks in the US (in Indiana, 
[LOCATION_005], Washington, West Virginia).16-18 The use of a mobile venue that meets out -of-
treatment PWID wherever they might be in their communit ies and links them to care systems 
and/or harm reduction is innovative, is likely to save lives and, if efficacious, could be efficiently  
scaled -up in the US, especially as the US health system responds to dramatic new pressures 
imposed by [CONTACT_25963] -19 pandemic . 
 
The initial COVID -19 outbreak in early 2020 change d the world  in innumerable ways , includ ing 
general disruption of daily life, implementation of social distancing policies , and prioritization of 
healthcare systems to address the coronavirus . These changes exacerbate d challenges PWID 
already face d to initiating or maintaining treatment/prophylaxis  regimens for OUD and HIV and 
to obtain ing other health care . Creative new strategies by [CONTACT_578954] -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_578889] d use of medical consultations by [CONTACT_518396] (telehealth), 
and relaxing restrictions on how m edications could be prescribed and dispensed (particularly 
buprenorphine/naloxone); these strategies have the potential to help PWID receive healthcare and 
maintain adherence . It is not clear what the healthcare environment will look like at the time this 
study begins, or how it will change during study implementation . To that end, this protocol 
include s research objectives that address the effect of COVID -[ADDRESS_760649] study addresses the current and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_578890]-risk persons in HIV care and prevention at a time 
when OUD has re -emerged as a potential  driver for HIV infections in the US . It does this by 
[CONTACT_578955]19,20 (i.e., buprenorphine, 
methadone and extended -release  naltrexone ). For pe rsons with OUD, MOUD functions as a key 
harm reduction and treatment strategy by [CONTACT_578956]. In this way, MOUD  enables  
increase d uptake  and adherence to ART among people living with both HIV and OUD  21,22 
including PWID . To date, however, only 15% of those with OUD in the US are receiving 
MOUD.9,[ADDRESS_760650] of an integrated strategy that 
provid es integrated care services including provision of ART and PrEP , MOUD treatment , STI 
testing and treatment, primary health care , and harm reduction  from a mobile health delivery unit  
(“mobile unit”) and supported by [CONTACT_578957] -based agencies.  
Primary outcomes are centered on  HIV and OUD : viral suppression , PrEP use , and uptake and 
use of MOUD . This study will also offer an unparalleled opportunity to document  the prevalence 
of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_760651] of the COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_578891].24,25       
 
Fit with the Network . The INTEGRA integrated strateg y accomplishes two important objectives  
of the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN ): (1) To conduct HIV research in at -risk PWID 
with OUD  and measure linked MOUD and HIV outcomes  in the US ; and (2) to address the 
multiplicity of challenges and barriers to primary care, HIV and HCV prevention an d care, and 
MOUD/harm reduction programs. This study  is well suited to make use of the resources  of the 
HPTN to conduct high impact HIV  prevention work in PWID with OUD , a key priority 
population for the HPTN . The availability of research sites in diverse geographic locations and 
the statistical and laboratory capacities of the HPTN are other key advantages of network  
engagement. The INTEGRA integrated strategy also address es in real time and in full measure 
the call for integrated strategies  to res pond to the ongoing dual epi[INVESTIGATOR_578892] ,[ADDRESS_760652] been successful  in engaging PWID in services that are either unacceptable 
or unavailable in brick and mortar settings.27,28  These prior studies provide  key support for the 
design of this study. This could raise the criticism that the outcome of this trial can be assumed to 
be favorable and does not require a randomized investigation . While there is hope and 
expectation  the intervention wil l be efficacious, there are numerous reasons why this study is 
worth while  even if one were to assume a positive outcome:  
 
• First, these would be the first data to inform  the improvement in outcomes using a mobile 
health delivery system , above an energetic n avigation condition , for improving rates of 
viral suppression and PrEP adherence among PWID  and for engaging and retaining these 
individuals in MOUD for significant periods . This study will provide a unique 
opportunity to assess exposure to  COVID -[ADDRESS_760653] of  COVID -19 on service  delivery  to PWID before and during the trial period .  
• Second, even if the intervention does improve outcomes, it may be that the improvement 
is negligible, or that it is not cost -effective . This is why the study  has built-in 
comprehensive costing and cost -effectiveness analyses . The peer navigation provided in 
the active control arm is to equal what is provided in  the intervention arm ; this will allow 
us to evaluate  the marginal effects of integrated care in the mobile unit  supported by 
[CONTACT_578958] -based services  without direct provision 
of care . We may find that most  of the benefit seen in the intervention arm is due to peer 
suppor t and navigation alone ; this would provide  policy makers with useful cost -benefit 
data. Important  data will also come from analy sis of  outcomes at 52 weeks , six months 
after the conclusion of the intervention . These data will inform policy makers about the 
durability (or lack thereof) of any gains seen in the intervention arm and/or control arm, 
particularly  whether navigation and/or mobile unit -based care need to be provided long 
term, or whether these interventions can be effective by “jump -starting” long -term 
recovery with a transition to  community -based services .  
• Last, if the mobile unit intervention proves to be successful, documentation of this effect 
in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be helpful for integrating this intervention 
into public health guidelines .  
 
  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760654] been included for young and female participants .  
 
• Women . Approximately 30% of PWID with OUD diagnosis are women29,[ADDRESS_760655] the experiences of 
women (who might otherwise be enrolled in small numbers) this study will target 
enrollment of 25% women regardless of HIV status.   
• Younger PWID . The median age for PWID i n the US30 is in the mid -40s, but those 18 -29 
years engage in HIV risk behaviors ( e.g., sharing injecting equipment or sex  without 
condoms ) at substantially higher rates than PWID in older groups.[ADDRESS_760656] likely to receive treatment are also young (under 26).34 To enrich our 
sample for persons at higher ris k of acquiring or transmitting HIV and having untreated 
OUD, we will aim to enroll 25% of participants younger than 30 years (approximately 
20% of PWID are younger than thirty years) regardless of their HIV status.30   
 
The Importance of Documenting Study Processes and Procedures. There is increasing recognition 
that mobile care is an approach that policy makers should be considering . In a review of 51 
studies published in 2017, the conclusions regarding the effects of using mobile health clinics  
(MHCs)  to deliver healthcare shows a consistent signal that: “…mobile health clinics are 
successful in re aching vulnerable populations, by [CONTACT_578959]. As a link between clinical and community settings, MHCs address both 
medical and social determinants of health, tackling health issues on a community -wide level. 
Furthermore, evidence suggest s that MHCs produce significant cost savings and represent a cost -
effective care delivery model that improves health outcomes in underserved groups.”[ADDRESS_760657] 
been recognized as presenting substantial limitations to using mobile health clinics to deliver 
integrated care services: (1) frag mentation of care; (2) financial issues; (3) spatial and structural 
limits; and (4) logistical challenges. This project will directly address fragmentation of care  by 
[CONTACT_578960]. As well, findings from the implementation science p ortion of 
this work will advise financial issues  necessary to mount and maintain using mobile medical 
units within a health jurisdiction. Mobile health clinics are, indeed, tight quarters. In preparing the 
mobile health units, it will be key to provide for  spaces that can be allotted for medical purposes, 
while also providing some spaces for consultations. The project will identify the need for 
additional spaces and creative approaches  that can be used to solve space issues (e.g., parking 
the mobile unit  next to a facility that can provide quiet and private spaces for navigation 
sessions) . The project will also advise methods for addressing logistical challenges , (e.g., 
portable generators to maintain refrigeration and other requirements, using WiFi “hot spo ts” for 
constant internet access, etc.).  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760658] practices in the recently published NASEM report, Opportunities to 
Improve Opi[INVESTIGATOR_578893]: Integrating Responses to a Dual 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].[ADDRESS_760659] practices (one in Lawrence , 
[LOCATION_005]) using a mobile unit (see section 1 -8 of the NASEM report ).  
 
This evidence, both quantitativ e and qualitative, provides strong justification for using a mobile 
unit approach for HPTN 094. The extent to which reductions in barriers of distance and stigma 
will produce superior outcomes compared to an enhanced control condition that includes active 
navigation will inform  policymakers in decisions about whether to adopt mobile health delivery 
system s in their jurisdictions. The implementation science aspect of the protocol will provide cost 
effectiveness data that will equip policymakers with cost data to advise implementing and 
maintaining a mobile health unit providing integrated care strategies in their jurisdiction.  
 
This integrated strategies approach  recogn izes the key link between rapid, coordinated and 
sustained  engagement in both MOUD and HIV prevention and care to achieve  relevant HIV and 
substance  use outcomes .26 The study  will use two dependent variables : MOUD use and use of  
antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimens for HIV treatment and prevention (ART for people living 
with HIV ; PrEP for people without HIV ). These outcomes will be documented by [CONTACT_578961].  
 
Summary . The national opi[INVESTIGATOR_578894] a crisis that threatens to feed a renewed HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. 
A threat of this nature requires that strategies to address the crisis  have goals that are as ambitious 
as the threat is grave . To that end,  the goal of this study  is that this intervention  will prove so 
efficacious that it will change policy in local, state and national jurisdictions responsible for 
addressing clinical practice for  PWID with OUD  in urban settings . Findings will document the 
prevalence of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_760660] of the COVID -19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_578895] .  
 
Audacious Goals.  The ambitious g oals for this study are as follows:  that 50% of participants in 
the intervention arm are on MOUD at 26 week s, with 40% on MOUD at 52 week s; that the death 
rate in the intervention arm is reduced by [CONTACT_2016], compared to the active control  arm; and that twice 
as many participants in the intervention arm are virally suppressed or on PrEP  compared to the 
active control arm .  
 
1.2.1 Implementation Science Framework  
 
The implementation science component of this study  provides the opportunity to  determine how 
to del iver this intervention  successfully and with fidelity  in different US settings (mid -Atlantic, 
South, West) that are affected differe ntly by [CONTACT_46248][INVESTIGATOR_2480] , HIV and COVID -[ADDRESS_760661] the implementation of  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  21 of 99 
20 February 2023  the intervention , and the primary and secondary study outcomes ; we will also  develop a database 
that will inform a more rapid translation of study results into public health practice .[ADDRESS_760662] Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) framework37 will 
guide  the implementation evaluation  in this study . PRISM  integrates theory  for new behavior 
adoption (Diffusion of Innovations model);  for chronic disease processes like OUD and HIV  (the 
Chronic Care model); and  for continuous  program  improvement (the Model for Improvement). 
PRISM  will allow  evaluation  of multi -level factors that influence the implementat ion process 
including , (i) how the intervention s in both arms are  perceived  by [CONTACT_578962], (ii) 
characteristics  that influence the delivery and receipt of the intervention in both arms , (iii) 
community -level factors in the external environment that  may influence how the intervention is 
accessed , (iv) systems - and policy -level factors that affect the infrastructure and sustainability of 
the intervention , and  (v) how COVID -19 affects  access to  the mix of integrated  services of 
MOUD, HIV care (ART, PrEP) , STI  and hepatitis  treatment , primary care , and harm reduction at 
the systemic and individual level.  Finally, PRISM allows  evaluat ion of  the implementation 
outcomes of the  intervention through the RE-AIM model (reach, effectiveness, adoption, 
implementation, maintenance ).38 
 
This implementation science  framework will use a mixed method approach leveraging data 
systematically captured from routine community engagement, fidelity monitoring, and efficacy 
evaluation procedures . These d ata will be augmented by [CONTACT_578963] e data collected at each site  
from  participants , providers of integrated health care in the mobile unit and key community 
stakeholders .

used to characterize HCV strains and the relationship between HIV and HCV infections , and to 
explore issues related to COVID -19.  
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  23 of 99 
20 February 2023  3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
INTEGRA will be a two -arm, individually randomized, unblinded longitudinal study . The study 
will be conducted in five US cities selected to represent the geographic diversity of the country’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817] ; for having an appr opriate population in sufficient numbers for timely enrollment 
of the study ; and for the ability to implement the study successfully . All potential participants will 
be screened and enrolled (if eligible) in a mobile unit. The mobile unit  will be configured as a 
mobile clinic, staffed by [CONTACT_578964] , and will travel to 
“hot spots” in the community frequented by [CONTACT_287354]. Clinicians providing care in the mobile unit  
will do so under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_578896] d, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a university health system or medical school.  Screening and enrollment 
procedures, which will take place over  a minimum of two visits, will include providing informed 
consent, obtaining opi[INVESTIGATOR_578897], answering questions about current and past 
health, and obtaining urine, blood and swab samples for laboratory tests.  
 
All enrolled participants will be PWID with OUD  (verified by [CONTACT_578965]) who are not 
on MOUD . Following randomization , participants in the intervention arm will be offered peer 
navigation and treatment for OUD ( MOUD ) integrated with HIV services (ART for people living 
with HIV, PrEP for people  without HIV) and additional health services  in a mobile unit for 26 
weeks . In the active control arm , participants will receive peer navigation to community -based  
services for the same services as the intervention arm for 26 weeks . Approximately 450 
participants will be enrolled  with about 225 participants  per arm, with a target minimum 25% 
women, 25% participants under 30 years of age , and 10% people living with HIV  at enrollment . 
 
The services that participants in both arms receive during the 26 wee ks of the intervention will be 
provided on a schedule determined by [CONTACT_292856]. A t baseline, a ll participants 
will be seen in the mobile unit to complete the consent process  and interview and to provide 
specimens for laboratory testing . Participants in the intervention  arm will receive immediate  
MOUD, ART, PrEP, STI  testing and treatment , hepatitis and pregnancy testing , and primary  
health services , and navigation to promote uptake of clinical services offered in the mobile unit . 
Before or at the start of a visit, participants will be assessed for COVID -19; if SARS -CoV -2 
infection is suspected, the visit will be deferred to a later date  and the participant will be referred 
for further evaluation and/or care, as indicated and avail able.  
 
Intervention arm participants will also receive immediate navigation to health services or 
diagnostic tests not available in the mobile unit , and to successfully transfer all care to existing 
facilities in the community  by 26 weeks . Participants in the active control arm  will receive 
navigation through 26 weeks to community -based services for all health services, including  
MOUD, ART, PrEP, STI  testing and treatment , HCV  treatment , primary health services  and 
COVID -19 evaluation , testing and care. Peer navigation will be delivered by a cadre of staff 
called peer navigators ; these navigators may be true peers, i.e.,  have been in recovery for OUD 
for at least a year and will have been trained and certified to provide recovery coachin g (support 
and assistance to help others initiate and adhere to MOUD) and health systems navigation.  When 
true peers are not available, staff members can deliver navigation services in the absence of lived 
experience but  should  have completed at least one year of education , job experience  or training in 
delivering navigation services to people living with OUD.  
 
Laboratory testing will be performed retrospectively to assess  MOUD , ART and PrEP use using  
samples collected at 26 weeks (primary endpoint) and 52 week s (secondary endpoint) to assess 
the initial and durable effects of the intervention . Laboratory testing will also be performed 
retrospectively to assess substance use, HIV incidence , HCV incidence  (52 weeks) , and 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  24 of 99 
20 February 2023  prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 seropositivity  (baseline, 26 and 52 week s). Results of retrospective 
testing will not be returned to the sites or participants. Results of p oint-of-care testing for MOUD  
and substance use testing at baseline, 26 and 52 weeks will b e provided to participants.  
Prevalence of bacterial STIs will be analyzed from samples drawn at baseline, week 26 and week 
52, but are processed locally at time of draw.

negative result . If this criterion cannot be met within 30 days  from the start of screening, 
the individual will be considered a screen failure and the volunteer has up to two more 
screening chances to  successfully complete the screening process again.  
• Received MOUD  in the 30 days prior to enrollment  by [CONTACT_6270] -report .  
• Co-enrollment in an y other  interventional study unless approved by [CONTACT_578966] ( CMC ) 
 
See SSP Section [ADDRESS_760664] 
COVID -19; the period of deferral will be determined based on criteria for discontinuation of 
isolation  per US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) guidelines or applicable local 
guidelines . Depending on the length of deferral, screening procedures may have to be repeated to 
establish eligibility.  
Note : The CMC is  a sub-group of the Protocol Team that includes physicians from sites, the 
Protocol Chair and Co -Chair  and the DAIDS Medical Officer . Additional roles of the CMC are 
addressed in se ctions 7, [ADDRESS_760665] (IRB).  
 
Recruitment of PWID with OUD   who are living with HIV or who are without HIV and at high -
risk will need attention at regular intervals to ensure adequate enrollment for the study in the time 
allotted. A recruitment plan will be developed at each site to guide outreach to and enrollment o f 
participants . Outreach  activities will be consistently conducted at “hot spots ” - facilities and 
venues where PWID  are commonly found  and can be contact[CONTACT_578967] .  
 
Hot spots will be identified and mapped at each site prior to the start of the project . Examples of 
locations that are common hot spots include venue -based areas  (locations outside jails, criminal 
justice community supervision programs, syringe exchange sites , detox centers , emergency rooms 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] ) and street -based areas ( tourist areas , parks, strolling areas, skid row , public 
housing ). Hot spots will change over the course of the study as groups of PWID who are not 
receiving MOUD migrate to new locations due to changes in the local environment (e.g., policing  
patterns , gentrification ). Each site  will therefore need to continually review their recruitment data 
and other information such as the productivity of hot spots in yielding enrollments .  
 
  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  26 of 99 
20 February 2023  Plans for recruitment at each site will be detailed (and revised) in the SOPs  and/or recruitment 
plan. Sites will be expected to use local data (e.g., heat maps of overdoses) and consultation with 
local experts to develop their recruitment plan  and keep it  updated . Local experts  consult ed may 
include 1) public health department officials (especially those responsible for conducting 
National HIV Behavioral Surveillance [NHBS ] and for managing publicly -funded MOUD), 2) 
law enforcement, 3) harm reduction leaders and advocates, 4) he alth care providers  (particularly 
infectious disease clinicians, emergency room physicians and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266]) , 5) medical 
examiners/coroner’s office, 6) scientists who are involved in studying PWID in the area and 7) 
community members.   As hot spots are ide ntified, this information will be recorded and 
maintained through the life of the study to provide a running list of environmental features (e.g., 
parks, “broken windows,” cheap motels, convenience and liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries, 
gentlemen’s clu bs, etc.) where PWID who are not  receiving MOUD may congregate.  
 
Hot spots will serve not only as sites for outreach and recrui tment, but also as sites where the 
mobile unit may be deployed to implement the study .  
 
In addition  to recruiting from identified hot spots  we will employ peer recruitment and referral 
strategies . Participants will be encouraged to recruit their peers from their social network, from 
other PWID  and from their communities. We will also encourage referrals  from providers such as 
emergency departments , alternative -to-incarceration programs, homeless shelters,  harm reduction 
programs, public health departments, etc. 
 
As noted in Section 1. 2 of this protocol, a minimum of 25%  women are planned for enrollment in 
this study  and a minimum of 25% under age 30 years . Sites may propose additional recruitment 
strategies needed to yield the expected minimums of women and youth for the study . 
 
4.4 Co-Enrollment Guidelines  
 
In general, participants in this study will not be allowed to take part in other concurrent 
interventional research studies during their study participation , unless approved by [CONTACT_133046] . This 
is due in part to concerns abou t participant study burden and to avoid confounding in the 
interpretation of the study data. This concern is particularly relevant  for co -enrollment in studies 
of long -acting HIV care and prevention products. Given this situation, t he CMC should be 
consulted for any possible exceptions, in cluding participation in  observational studies.   
 
4.5 Participant Retention  
 
It is expected that this population under study (PWID  with OUD  who are not in MOUD 
treatment) will present challenges exceeding  those encountered in traditional HPTN protocols. As 
such, retention activities will require additional attention and resource to ensure that 90% 
retention targets at [ADDRESS_760666] operating 
procedures (SOPs) to achieve  the 90% retention goal. Components of such procedures may 
include:  
• Thorough explanation of the study visit schedule , the importance of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_578902], procedural requirements during the informed consent process and re -emphasis of 
the importance of these visits and re quirements at each study visit.  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  27 of 99 
20 February 2023  • Thorough explanation of the importance of both study treatment groups to the overall 
success of the study.  
• Collection of detailed and valid locator information at the study Screening Visit, with 
active review and updating of  this information at each subsequent visit . 
• Providing a small  incentive for reg ular locator information updates  or high study 
retention . 
• Soliciting consent to contact [CONTACT_39487], such as physician s, social worker s or nurse s, 
when trying to locate the participant.  
• Use of mappi[INVESTIGATOR_578903] . 
• Use of appropriate and timely visit reminder mechanisms.  
• Immediate (as soon as recognized), consistent (until a response is gotten) and 
multifaceted (all contacts reached) follow -up activities on missed visits.  
• Mobilization of trained outreach workers or “tracers” to complete in -person contact [CONTACT_578968]/or other community locations.  
• Regular communication with the study community at large to increase awareness about 
HIV/AIDS and explain the purpose of HIV prevention research and the importance of 
completing research study visits.  
In addition to the  procedures described , which are standard for all HPTN studies, an important 
aspect that will facilitate retention of this population will be to ensure that all study staff, and 
particularly clinicians and peer navigators, display a non -judgmental, support ive attitude toward 
PWID in general and study participants specifically, and that they build genuine rapport with 
participants during study encounters  in both arms .   
 
It will also be important for study staff to establish and maintain rapport and good wil l with the 
community of PWID and with those who work with PWID in the local setting . This will facilitate 
reconnecting with participants who have missed visits or become lost to follow up, an inevitable 
eventuality when working with this population .  
 
4.[ADDRESS_760667] ( IoR) or designee also may withdraw participants from the study in order to protect 
their safety and/or if they are unwilling or unable to comply with required study procedures after 
consultation with the Protocol Chair, DAIDS Medical Officer, SDMC Protocol Statistician, and 
LOC Clinical Research Manager (CRM).  
 
Participants also may be withdrawn if the study sponso r, government or regulatory authorities, or 
IRB terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  
 
Every reasonable effort will be made to complete a final evaluation (as described in Section 6. 5 
and Appendix I ) of participants who terminate from the stud y prior to the Week [ADDRESS_760668] the reason(s) for all withdrawals from the study in participants’ study 
records.  
  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  28 of 99 
20 February 2023  5.0 STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
Participants in b oth study arms will receive initial medical assessment and services in the mobile 
unit during Screening and Enrollment  (see Section 5.1 for details) . Following enrollment and 
randomization : 
 
• Those assigned to the intervention arm will receive medical services for OUD ( MOUD ), 
HIV treatment or prevention (ART or PrEP) , and other primary care conditions that can 
be managed  in the mobile unit (see Table 2 below) . They will also receive 26 weeks of 
peer navigation . Although medical services will initially be based in the mobile unit , a 
goal of peer navigation will be to success fully transition  participants to services at 
existing facilities in the communi ty by  26 weeks .  
• Those assigned to the active control arm  will receive [ADDRESS_760669] a final study 
visit for assessment of additional secondary endpoints . Table 1 (p.33 summarizes services that  
will be provided to participants in the two arms. Table 2 (p.37) provides details of the medical 
services  that will be provided in the mobile unit  to intervention arm participants . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_760670] remotely (e.g ., over the telephone) or outside of the mobile unit , per 
guidelines . Those suspected to have COVID -19 will be deferred from screening and referred for 
testing and/or treatment, as appropriate and available . 
 
Once  informed consent  has been obtained , participant s will begin screening procedures and, if 
appropriate, enrollment into the study. As part of Screening and Enrollment, all participants will 
receive assessment by a clinician in the mobile unit  and point -of-care testing for OUD, HIV,  and 
pregnancy ( for those who can become pregnant ). Samples will  also be collected for laboratory 
testing for HIV, HCV, HBV, HAV, STIs , and hematology/chemistry  at this time . Those who test 
HIV positive will receive additional testing as appropriate (CD4 cell count, viral loa d, resistance 
testing). At enrollment, basic  medical services  will be provided to all participants,  including 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_578904] , provision of harm reduction services 
(naloxone kits  and, where possible , syringe/needle exchange  services ), and preparation of a 
treatment plan . All participants will be assessed for OUD diagnosis  per the DSM -[ADDRESS_760671], participants will be provided immediate access to MOUD  to control 
withdrawal symptoms quickly and thereby [CONTACT_578969]. The  MOUD  
regimen provided in the mobile unit will be influenced by [CONTACT_2299]’s recent drug use and 
treatment history, the drug regimens used in local opi[INVESTIGATOR_297783], and a vailability of 
medications on the mobile unit  (i.e., a restricted range  of medications will be available on the 
mobile unit ; a wider range of MOUD options will be available via navigation/linkage to regularly  
available  resources  at local clinics ). The clinician in the mobile unit will have the necessary 
medical waiver (Drug A ddiction Treatment Act - 2000  “X” waiver) and clinical experience to 
provide MOUD  to this population .  
 
For those identified as living with HIV during Screening and Enrollment  (and not already 
established in ART elsewhere) , and for those who acquire HIV  during the intervention period, 
ART will be provided in the mobile unit. Those identified as being without HIV at Enrollment 
will be provided risk reduction counseling , assessed for PrEP  and offered  PrEP according to 
assessment ; these participants will be tested for HIV infection  during the intervention period . 
Clinical care including applicable laboratory test monitoring for participants living with HIV and 
those on PrEP will be provided per national clinical guidelines . Over time, these participants will 
be linked to appropriate long -term ART or PrEP service settings.  
 
Based upon the results of testing for HAV, HBV and HCV at Enrollment, participants will meet 
with their navigators to receive facilitated referral to the most appropriate community -based 
services in their area for vaccination and/or treatment , anticipated to be Federally -Qualified 
Health Centers ( FQHCs ) and clinics with experience in providin g hepatitis services for PWID. 
An exception to this will be for H BV treatmen t, where ART or PrEP regimens provided in the 
mobile unit can also treat HBV infection , if determined to be appropriate by [CONTACT_136395] .  
 
STI treatment (or referral for ca ses that cannot be addressed in the mobile unit ) will be provided 
for those with laboratory -confirmed infection from samples collected at Enrollment (testing for 
GC/CT and syphilis) ; at all visits , participants with STI symptoms  will be offered  empi[INVESTIGATOR_431896]. Sites will use local guidelines for interpretation of test results for clinical management. 
To determine  syphilis prevalence , syphilis results will also be evaluated retrospectivel y at the 
HPTN LC to differentiate active infection from p ast exposure .  
 
Assessment and/or treatment of other basic medical conditions will be provided in the mobile unit 
for participants in the intervention arm  (see Table 2). Treatment or management of more complex 
conditions  will require referral . In this population, it is expected that few participants will  already  
be successfully engaged with health services providers in their community . However,  if a 
participant does prefer to receive some or all of their care from community -based  services instea d 
of the mobile unit  (for example, if they are already receiving HIV care from a clinic in the 
community), that will be allowed and supported  by [CONTACT_578950].  
 
Clinicians on the mobile unit will assess participants in the intervention arm for COVID -[ADDRESS_760672] 26 weeks . Participants with suspected  COVID -19 or recent exposure  will be 
referred for services in the community and facilitated in accessing those services.   
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  30 of 99 
20 February 2023  Participants who also use stimulants (methamphetamine, cocaine) in addition to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], will be 
referred to 12 -step meetings available locally such as crystal meth anonymous, narcotics 
anonymous and alcoholics anonymous. Participants will be as sisted in finding counseling services 
for evidence -based behavioral treatment, where available.  
 
Harm reduction services ( naloxone kits , and where  possible, needle/syringe exchange) will be  
available on the mobile unit , as will condoms and lubricant . We will collaborat e with local 
community -based organizations  providing such services  to augment what is offered in the mobile 
unit. Peer navigators will offer condoms and lubricants during their meeting with participants.  
 
5.2.2 Medical Services  - Active Control Arm 
 
Except for the services described above in Section 5.1, medical services for participants in the 
active control arm  will not be provided in the mobile unit but will be provided by [CONTACT_578970] (referred to i n this protocol as “ community -based services ”) according 
to the local standard of care  (SOC) . Throughout the [ADDRESS_760673]  both as health system  
navigators  (assisting participants to access care  in a fractured health system ) and as peer recovery 
coaches  with lived OUD experience  (assisting participants to initiate and sustain MOUD 
treatment ). It is possible that peer recovery coaches may not be available to hire for this role. In 
such an instance, it is acceptable to hire a peer navigator who lacks lived experience, but who has 
at least one year of education, job experience or training in deli vering navigation services to 
PWID.  
 
Peer navigators will motivate and assist participants  to successfully enroll in and consistent ly use 
MOUD, ART, PrEP , as well as to receive STI testing and treatment, hepatitis vaccine or 
treatment , SARS -CoV -2 testing  (if available ), and referral for services, primary care  and harm 
reduction services . It is anticipated that many participants will be eligible to receive medical 
insurance or other government support for their medical care and treatment . Peer navigators wi ll 
help participants sign up for/access health  insurance or other programs for which they are 
eligible , especially if no insurance is available . Depending on participant need, n avigation 
services will include identifying appropriate health service provider s in the community, 
arrangement of  medical appointments , remind ing participants of upcoming appointments, 
assisting with transport or accompaniment to appointments  (whether in the mobile unit  or at 
community -based services) , and transfer of medical records . Although assistance with obtaining 
health care services and adhering to treatment/prophylaxis regimens  will be the primary focus of 
peer navigation, peer navigators  will also provide referrals to local resources for participan ts who 
have needs related to food security, housing and employment .  
 
Participants in both arms will work with a trained peer navigator  for the first 26 weeks on study . 
It is expected that initial interactions between the peer navigator  and a participant w ill be 
conducted in person, beginning with the Enrollment Visit in the mobile unit . For participant s with 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  31 of 99 
20 February 2023  a phone, it is expected that the peer navigator  will use messaging apps/texts to maintain regular 
contact [CONTACT_46144], confirm appointments, loca te those who have missed scheduled visits, 
etc. throughout the [ADDRESS_760674] with temporary shelter placements for those who need them and 
will provide transport vouchers (e.g., bus tokens) to enable participants to access services and 
remain in care .  
 
The frequency and timing of navigation encounters will be measured for both arms in order to 
monitor dose by [CONTACT_578971], minutes spen t per encounter and types of 
activities, referrals and services completed by [CONTACT_329757] . The study staff supervisor will meet 
with the navigators on a weekly basis in both conditions and provide support for navigators as 
described in the SOP. Rather tha n set a required “dose” of navigation for each arm, monitoring 
implementation of navigation will document whether equipoise is maintained between conditions 
through the trial when evaluating efficacy of the mobile unit on primary and secondary outcomes, 
and when evaluating improvements in outcomes for both conditions compared to baseline.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_760675] at 
locations other than the mobile unit  and may occur by [CONTACT_179307] m essaging app/text . The peer 
navigator  will also be responsible for working with the participant during the intervention period 
to prepare them to transition to community -based services  by 26 weeks .  
 
5.3.2 Navigation Services - Active Control Arm 
 
The role of the  peer navigator  for active control arm  participants will be to link them to 
community -based services  for the same types of medical services  provided in the mobile unit in 
the intervention arm, i.e. , MOUD , HIV treatment (ART) and prevention (PrEP), vaccin ation or  
treatment for hepatitis , STIs  testing and treatment , SARS -CoV -2 testing (if available ), and 
referral , primary care  and harm reduction services.  As described for the intervention arm, initial 
meetings between the participant and the navigator will be in -person . As the participant -navigator 
relationship becomes more established, interactions can be expected to occur by [CONTACT_578972]/text .  
 
5.4 Medication Considerations   
 
All of the drugs that will be provided as part of services in the mobile  unit will be US Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved medications in common use for these conditions ; this 
study does not involve any investigational products . Some medications  provide d from the mobile 
unit will be procured locally by [CONTACT_578973] . 
FTC/TDF, FTC/TAF and BIC/F/TAF provided by [CONTACT_578974] s. Because the MOUD medication expected to be used in this study will be 
buprenorphine, or combination buprenorphine/naloxone, both schedule III controlled substance s, 
the study team will work with the US Drug Enforcement Administration at the national and local 
level to comply with policies  for dispensation of buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone  to 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  32 of 99 
20 February 2023  participants . Study sites are responsible for procuring antibiotics locally for STI treatment  and 
may choose to locally procure buprenorp hine-containing regimens for MOUD .

HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760681] results will be provided to participants in a timely fashion. The clinical 
teams will attempt to report results to participants in the following time frames: routine normal 
laboratory results will be reported to patients within two weeks, routine abnormal results within 
two days, and critical abnormal results the same day . Depending on the circumstance and 
urgency, r esults may be provided to partic ipants via phone call , medical app,  in person or via 
letter (if participant has an address). The personnel who provide results (both normal and 
abnormal) will be clinical staff and non -clinical staff  (as permitted by [CONTACT_427] ), who 
have received appropriate  trainin g.  
 
We will respond flexibly  and in accord  with federal and local  health policies and guidelines  to the 
challenges presented by [CONTACT_578983] -[ADDRESS_760682] occur 
within 30 days of initiation of  screening , defined as the date the participant signs the informed 
consent form . Screen ing and Enrollment may not occur on the same day.  
 
Sites will follow the HIV testing algorithm for screening included in the SSP Manual . Individuals 
deemed not eligible will be informed that they do not meet the eli gibility cri teria for the study and 
will be referred for appropriate medical care, if necessary.   
 
Potential participants may be rescreened  up to two times  (three screening attempts total) at the 
discretion of the IoR or their designee.   
 
To protect community members and staff, it is expected that sites will implement pre -screening 
procedures to identify persons with symptomatic  COVID -19 among those presenting for 
screening.  Those with suspected COVID -19 or recent exposure will be deferred  from screening 
and referred for community -available services /care/treatment.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_760683] one day after Enrollment . But 
there may be cases in which a participant will be ready to be induced at Enrollment  and MOUD 
will begin that day . This flexibility -- to start MOUD either at Enrollment or aa later clinical care 
visit-- is reflected in the schedule of evaluations (Appendix I) .  
 
Similarly, it is expected that most  participants in the intervention arm will not initiate ART or 
PrEP until after they are initiated on MOUD, at a later clinical care  visit . However, there may be 
instances where initiating ART or PrEP immediately is a high priority for a participant and is 
supported by [CONTACT_15370] . In such cases ART or PrEP may be started at the Enrollment Visit. 
This flexibility in when to start ART or PrEP is reflected in the schedule of evaluations 
(Appendix I) . We also anticipate that some participants may already be on ART , in which case 
peer navigation will support  continuation of ART and HIV care at their existing  provider.   
 
As part of enrollment procedures, staff wil l assess potential participants for COVID -19. Persons 
who are otherwise eligible to be enrolled will have enrollment deferred if they are suspected to  
have COVID -19, until they meet the criteria for discontinuation of isolation per CDC guidelines 
or applic able local guidelines . Depending on the length of deferral, screening procedures may 
have to be repeated to establish eligibility . Enrollment may need to be paused if COVID -[ADDRESS_760684] udy is being 
implemented.  
 
6.3 Clinical Care and Navigation Visits Between Enrollment and Week 26 
 
Between the Enrollment Visit and the  week  26 visit, participants in both arms will engage with 
study staff regularly for peer navigation . Expectation s for the frequency of visits between 
participants and navigators will be spelled out in the SSP manual, but the actual timing , length 
and content of n avigation visits  for any given participant  will be determined by [CONTACT_578984] a fixed study visit schedule.  
 
In the intervention arm, participants will be seen in the mobile unit as needed to provide 
medication and to manage adherence to MOUD  and ART or PrEP, and to address other 
participant health needs . These will be considered “ care visits .”   
 
Intervention arm participants who have a reactive/positive test at a clinical care visit and are 
confirmed to have HIV based on testing at the Confirmatory visit will follow the Schedule of 
Events for participants who are living with HIV (see Appendix IA) at all future visits .  
 
If a participant has a documented positive HIV status outside of the study (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8735], for 
example) after enrollment and before the week 26  visit, confirmatory testing should occur at a 
clinical care visit (see Section 6.6).  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760685] diagnosed with HIV outside of the study will be allowed to 
come to the mobile unit before week 26 for an interim visit for HIV testing and/or Confirmatory 
visit (see Section 6.6). If HIV infection is confirmed at that study visit, these participants will 
follow the Schedule of Events for participants who are living with HIV (Appendix IA) at all 
future visits.  
 
These same procedures will be followed for participants who seroconvert between the week [ADDRESS_760686] data will be captured into the study database from peer navigation and clinical  care visits to 
document and describe the intervention as delivered  (particularly the “dose” of navigation 
delivered in each arm , to assist with  interpret ation of  primary and secondary  outcomes ), to assist 
the study team in monitoring fidelity and comparab ility of delivery of the intervention during the 
period of study conduct and to enable the study team to make real -time improvements to 
intervention delivery during execution of the trial.  
 
It is anticipated that the COVID -19 pandemic will require accommodations to how participant 
visits with peer navigators or on the mobile unit can be conducted . Enhanced infection control 
procedures such as wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE), re duced density of persons 
allowed in and around the unit, and thorough disinfection of the unit between participants will be 
undertaken. Participants will be assessed for COVID -19 before beginning a visit and  deferred 
from continuing if COVID -19 is suspecte d. Guidelines for resumption of in-person visits will be 
per CDC and/or local guidelines for discontinuation of isolation . CDC and local guidelines will 
be followed regarding quarantine of staff with potential  exposure to persons with known or  
suspected COVID -19. If the  intensif ication of the COVID -[ADDRESS_760687] mobile phones, sites 
may provide peer navigation and clinical care via telemedicine, with appropriate training of peer 
navigators  and clinicians in these approaches . Uninterrupted provision of medications for 
MOUD, ART and PrEP may be instituted through in -person delivery that mai ntains social 
distancing while insuring delivery to the prescribed recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] . Measures will be taken to ensure 
that participants taking ART or PrEP are receiving appropriate clinical follow -up, including 
periodic laboratory testing.   
 
6.4 Week 26 Visit  
 
The week  26 visit marks the end of the intervention period for both arms of the study.  Biological 
samples obtained at this visit will be used for assessment of primary and secondary objectives.  
For participants in both arms, peer navigation  will end at 26 weeks ; from this point forward, 
participants will be responsible for obtaining care from community -based services  without further 
assistance from study staff.   
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  43 of 99 
20 February 2023  Blood, urine and swabs will be collected from participants for laboratory assessment of HIV  
infection  (in those not previously confirmed to have  HIV) , ART adherence  or PrEP use, STIs, 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_760688] at 
enrollment, HCV RNA .  Results from point -of-care testing  (e.g., for HIV and preg nancy) will be 
provided to the participant  at the visit . For all other medical diagnoses or conditions identified 
during or after the visit, referral to community -based services  will be provided.  The site will 
attempt to provide any laboratory res ults obtained after the visit to the participant and to refer the 
participant to obtain any medical care/treatment indicated by [CONTACT_578985] -based 
services . 
 
Although  the mobile unit will be prioritized for Screening, Enrollment and provisi on of 
intervention services , this research visit may take place in the mobile unit , or at a community 
clinic or CRS . Conduct of these visits may take place at appropriate locations in the community 
where participants will feel comfortable, such as the CRS or an affiliated clinic or community 
space . Should concerns about the COVID -[ADDRESS_760689] of in -person  visits 
impossible , week 26 vis its may be conducted using telephone/internet visits as scheduled , with 
collection of biospecimens at a different date . The study team would make every effort in such a 
situation to minimize the disruption to the study schedule, to collect as much data as possible 
while  prioritiz ing the health of participants and staff.  
 
6.5 Week 52 Visit  
 
The week  52 visit marks the end of the period on study for all participants.  Samples obtained at 
this visit will be used for assessment of secondary objectives.  Blood, urine and swabs will be 
collected from all participants for laboratory assessment of HIV  (in those not previously 
confirmed to have HIV) , ART adherence  or PrEP use, STIs, SARS -CoV-2, HCV  (for those 
negative at Enrollment) , substance use  and HCV RNA (for those with a prior positive HCV 
antibody test) .  Test results available during the visit will be provided to the participant. The site 
will attempt to provide any clinically important laboratory results obtained after the visit to the 
participant (e.g ., confirmed HIV, STIs, HCV ; results of HIV drug restistance testing ) with referral 
to community -based services .  As with the week [ADDRESS_760690]  a Confirmatory visit (see Appendix I B). A Confirmatory visit 
must also be performed if the particip ant or a health care provider provides written documentation 
of HIV test results from testing performed outside of the study that indicate a positive HIV status 
(see SSP Manual for documentation requirements).  Prior to documentation of HIV positive status 
at an in -study Confirmatory visit, participants should continue to be followed using the Schedule 
of Events for participants who were without HIV at Enrollment. Procedures at these visits 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  44 of 99 
20 February 2023  (described in Appendix IA) may be combined with procedures for the in -study Confirmatory visit 
(described in Appendix IB) in the following three scenarios:  
(1) Written documentation of positive HIV status obtained outside of the study was first 
provided to study staff at an interi m or clinical care visit, but the participant did not return for 
the in -study Confirmatory visit before the Week 26 or Week 52 visit, or  
(2) Written documentation of positive HIV status obtained outside of the study is first 
provided to study staff at the time of the Week 26 or Week 52 visit, or  
(3) The participant tested positive for HIV in the study at an interim or clinical care visit but 
did not return for the in -study Confirmatory visit before the Week [ADDRESS_760691] follow procedures shown in Appendix I B. 
 
If the testing from the  Confirmatory visit indicates a positive HIV status, participants will follow 
the Schedule of Study Visits and Procedures  for participants who are living with H IV at all future 
visits (see Appendix IA). If the testing performed at the Confirmatory visit does not confirm the 
HIV positive result, notify the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_578908]. Please  refer to the SSP Manual for further information.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_760692] -Effectiveness Data Collection 
Procedures  
 
Implementation Evaluation Procedures. We will use a mixed methods , theory -driven (PRISM)  
conceptual mo del to determine factors that affect deliver y of integrated care using a mobile unit, 
supported by  [CONTACT_578950] , successfully  and with fidelity in different US settings co -affected 
by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_578909]. Quantitative and qualitative data will identify with depth and 
precision the multi -level factors (i.e. patient, healthcare organization  and personnel, community 
environment, structural) that correspond with the fidelity of implementation, effectiveness, an d 
dissemination of integrated health care delivered in a mobile unit including responding to the 
impact on service delivery imposed by [CONTACT_4113] -19. To achieve the implementation  evaluation 
objectives , site-level data will be collected across three timepoints : (a) the pre -implementation 
phase of the study to document baseline status of the local opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], the local HIV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], the policies and agencies aligned to address these  epi[INVESTIGATOR_578910], and to identify fac tors that m ay influence the delivery of integrated health 
services via mobile unit and peer navigation  (e.g. site-level  access to quality addiction, HIV, and 
primary care for PWID) , (b) the implementation phase of the study to collect data on factors that 
promote or impede the implementation of the interv ention  (in the mobile unit  and for peer 
navigation) to inform site -level refinements and processes that may influence primary and 
secondary outcomes, and (c) we will use the findings in the dat a analytical plan to understand 
what influence implementation factors may have had on the primary  and secondary outcomes .  
 
Data sources.   
Data for i mplementation evaluation  will be collected at each study site  over the course of the 
study, and reviewed mo nthly by [CONTACT_578986] . Data will be drawn from  three primary sources:  
 
1. Protocol activities  involved in the conduct of the study (i.e ., routine meetings , fidelity 
monitoring, and efficacy evaluation procedures ). These data will be routinely collected by 
 
 
[CONTACT_578987] 094, Final Version 2.0  45 of 99 
20 February 2023  study staff involved with documenting  (i) the process and outcomes of study -related 
meetings,  (ii) capturing participant data, and (iii) documenting the conduct of the study .  
• A standing agenda item or specific prompts related to the implementation evaluation will 
be added to existing community engagement meetings and protocol site and cross-site 
meetings with study staff.  Relevant responses will be flagged in meeting minutes or  
transcripts and field notes from these meetings for analysis.  
• Participant records and encounter forms, q uality assurance and qual ity control (QA/QC) 
activities  conducted by [CONTACT_3655] , and standardized checklists for assessing fidelity metrics in 
clinical enco unters with providers and linkage to services by [CONTACT_578988] s will be 
reviewed  and summarized at the site  level for analysis . 
• Sociodemographic data  (e.g. age, gender, race)  on PWID at each site will be obtained 
from publishe d reports or service records from reg ularly-available services (i.e. MOUD,  
ART,  PrEP , and harm reduction ) and for PWID who are screened and enrolled into the 
study protocol.  
 
2. In-depth interviews  with PWID , as well as providers of integrated health care in the mobile 
unit and key community stakeholders . Interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_578989] -person or over the telephone /internet  and will be recorded . We 
anticipate our qualitative sampling framework (see Table 3) will generate ~39 in -depth 
interviews per study site ( 195 interviews total) to be conducted approximately 6 months after 
the start of the study  implementation phase  while the study is still in the field . 
 
Table 3- Sampling frame for in -depth qualitative interviews  
 
Source  Selection strategy  Sample size per site  
PWID  ~20% of PWID enrolled at each study site  will be 
purposefully  sampled. Sampling criteria will aim to select 
PWID enrolled in the study who are demographically 
representative  of the local injection community in terms of 
age, gender, race , and HIV status.  n=17 
Mobile Unit 
staff Staff who support integrated healthcare  deliver ed in the 
mobil e unit at each site will be sampled. This includes 
clinicians delivering MOUD and ARV treatment (n=2), 
peer navigators  (n=3), and frontline staff routinely engaged 
with PWID recruitment  and tracking activities (n=2)  n=7 
Community 
stakehol ders Key community stakeholders will be identified through the 
study’s form ative landscape analysis  to map  community 
assets and gaps in the pre -implementation  phase. This 
process will identify regularly available  MOUD, HIV, 
harm reduction, and primary care services at each study 
site. Through this process we will invite up to 3 
stakeholders from each of the following service domains 
who would be involved in the coordin ation and future 
sustainabili ty of integrated health care and peer navigat ion: 
HIV services  (n=3) , MOUD services (n=3) , harm reduction  
services (n=3), primary care (n=3), and public health 
officials (n=3) . n=[ADDRESS_760693] of qualitative methods . 
• Landscape analysis conducted in the pre -implementat ion phase of the study will 
document the availability of MOUD, HIV, harm reduction , and primary care services 
regularly available  at local clinics at each study site, how these services were impacted by 
[CONTACT_4113] -19, as well as structural determinants of exist ing servi ce delivery (e.g. policy  
regulating the distribution of unused  needles, public health infrastructure ) to ensure 
participant recruitment  and intervention delivery occur in the local areas with the greatest 
need . 
• Ecological assessment s will document factors in the community and mobile care -delivery 
environments that may affect recruitment, retention and delivery of services in both arms . 
These brief assessments  will be routinely conducted throughout the implemen tation phase 
to guide real -time improvements and refinements  in the conduct of the study and to 
document process -oriented factors that may affect primary and secondary outcomes . 
 
Cost -Effectiveness  Procedures   
No participant -oriented procedures are required to complete  the planned cost -effectiveness 
analyses  (CEA) . Data sources for CEA  will include estimates of effectiveness from modeling , 
and estimates of costs to include (1) costs of all commodities used in the intervention; (2) labor 
costs for intervention workers; (3) intervention startup costs; (4) average time participants  spent 
with intervention including transportation / staff time / time for referrals; (6) local wages of target 
population; (5) rent; (6) maintenance; (7) volunteer activities; (8) user fees; (9) value of donated 
goods and services; and (10) other relevant costs, including training of providers and mobile unit 
fuel cos ts.   
 
Cost estimates will incorporate data from time -and-motion (TAM)  studies . These  studies  will be 
conducted at each study site  during the implemenation phase at two timepoints: soon after  study 
initiation and again when the participants have begun to t ransition from integrated health care 
delivered on the mobile unit to community -based services . These data will document the number 
of staff and number of staff hours involved in delivering the intervention to participants receiving 
(i) integrated healthca re on the mobile unit, and (ii) transitioning PWID from the mobile unit to 
community -based care via peer navigation . TAM studies will collect data during staff interactions 
with participants , but will not entail  collection of participant -specific data. 
 
6.8 Study Visit Windows  
 
For each required study visit, there is an allowable visit window specifying on which study days 
(post -enrollment) the visit is "allowed" to be completed . The allowable visit windows are 
contiguous between week [ADDRESS_760694] at more than one visit (a “split visit”) . Sites are 
strongly encouraged to complete a split enrollment visit within [ADDRESS_760695] be completed by 30 days after 
screening  (as defined in the SSP) . If the potential participant is not ra ndomized within 30 days of 
screening, they will be an enrollment failure and will need to be re -screened if the site wishes to 
enroll them . Potential participants will only be randomized once all procedures expected for the 
day of enrollment  (see SSP)  have  been completed .

7.0 SAFETY MONITORING AND SERIO US ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
7.1 Adverse Event Definition and Reporting  
 
In this study, the only drugs that will be dispensed or prescribed will be US FDA -approved 
medications for treatment or prevention of OUD, HIV, and STIs  and prescriptions for 
contraceptives, primary care concerns, and chronic conditions, if indicated . There are no 
investigat ional products in this protocol . Therefore, monitoring and reporting of unanticipated 
treatment -related risks  will be limited to  the following : Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R s) to study products (those drugs provided  centrally  by [CONTACT_578990] )will be collected and reported in an expedited manner to the DAIDS Adverse Event 
Reporting System (DAERS) ( https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/manual -expedited -
reporting -adverse -events -daids ). 
 
Adverse e vents (AEs)  that study staff become aware of will be recorded in source documentation 
and will be assessed for seriousness. Non -serious AEs will not be reported in the study database 
and referrals for care will be provided as necessary . Serious adverse eve nts (SAEs) are those AEs 
that result in one or more of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life) event  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• A medically important event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578911] (e.g., fatal 
overdoses or other addiction -related deaths) and life -threatening events requiring intervention 
(e.g. overdoses /overdose reversals) . Study participants will be provided contact [CONTACT_578991] . For life -
threatening events, they will also be instructed to seek immediate emergency care .  
 
All SAEs will be entered into the study data base, with appropriate levels of documentation and 
notification of the IRB and sponsors. SAEs will  be assessed for relatedness to study product(s)  
(centrally -supplied ART or PrEP)  by [CONTACT_578992] . SAEs are included in reports  to the 
Study Monitoring Committee  (SMC ) for review.

is identified, by [CONTACT_578993], it will be reported and responded to 
as described below in Section 7.4. 
  
7.1.1 Grading Severity of Events  
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, will be used for determining and reporting the severity of 
adverse events. The DAIDS grading table is available on the DAIDS Regula tory Support Center

[IP_ADDRESS]  EAE Reporting Requirements for the Study  
The S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting Category, as defin ed in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, will be 
used for this study.  
The study products for which expedited reporting are required are centrall y-supplied PrEP  or 
ART : 
PrEP 
• Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200mg/300mg (FTC/TDF, Truvada®) 
• Emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 200mg/25mg (FTC/TAF, Descovy®) 
ART  
• Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 50mg/200mg/25mg (BIC/F/TAF, 
Biktarvy®) 
In addition to the S[LOCATION_003]R Reporting Category identified above, other adverse events that must be 
reported in an expedited manner are abnormal pregnancy outcomes . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grading Severity of EAEs  
The most current Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table) is used and is available on the DAIDS RSC website 
at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -adverse -event -gradin g-tables .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EAE Reporting Period  
The EAE reporting period for this study is as per the DAIDS EAE Manual.  
After the protocol -defined EAE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only S[LOCATION_003]Rs as 
defined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual will be reported to DAIDS if the study staff 
become aware of the events on a passive basis (from publicly available information). · Abnormal 
pregnancy outcomes  should be followed until the final outcome can be determined. even after the 
participant is off study,  up until the point that the study database is closed . 
7.[ADDRESS_760699] Reporting  
 
It is possible that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others, and that a 
social impact may result (participants could be perceived as having HIV  or at high risk for 
acquiring HIV or could be subject to stigma related to their HIV status or their use of injection 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  50 of 99 
20 February 2023  drugs). For example, participants could be treated unfairly, or could have problems accessing 
work or social benefits or being accepted by [CONTACT_578995]/or communities. A social impact 
that is reported by [CONTACT_132754]/designee to be serious or unexpected will 
be reported to the IRB at least annually, or according to the IRB’s requirements. Social impacts 
will be col lected and submitted to the study database during regular visits. In the event that a 
participant reports a social impact, every effort will be made by [CONTACT_578996], and/or refe rral to appropriate resources 
for the safety of the participant. Each site will provide such responses and counseling in 
accordance with standardized guidance in the SSP Manual. While maintaining participant 
confidentiality, study sites may engage their community advisory board ( CAB ) in exploring the 
social context surrounding instances of social impacts, to minimize the potential occurrence of 
such an impact.  
 
It will be important that site teams routinely review social impacts that occur among their 
participants and alert the CMC, including the DAIDS Medical Officer, if any individual impacts 
or trends in impacts raise concern about conduct of the study at that site or raise the possibility of 
serious or unanticipated risks to study participants posed by t he trial . See Section 7.[ADDRESS_760700] a “landscape analysis” of the local environment, 
including local l aws, policies and practices affecting PWID . As part of this analysis, the site team 
will determine the degree of risk (of arrest, incarceration, physical harm, unwanted disclosure of 
drug use, of other harms) facing PWID in that location and whether study participation may put 
PWID at greater risk for harm . Each site will also enact a strategy to mitigate these risks and 
build support for the study prior to implementation and during study conduct . A key component 
of this work will be engagement of local sta keholders such as government officials, law 
enforcement personnel, public health departments, local medical providers, and community 
leaders to explain the study and obtain support for the work .  
 
7.[ADDRESS_760701] of this research . An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research  places study participants  or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
All unanticipated problems that meet the three criteria above will be reported to the IRB  and to 
the CMC as described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_760702] detailed SOPs  describing 
methods  for identifying, reporting and managing serious or unanticipated safety concerns raised 
by [INVESTIGATOR_88070] s, social impacts or other unanticipated problem s.  
 
When sites identify a potentially serious or unexpected risk or problem, they will report it to the 
CMC . The CMC will work together with appropriate entities such as the site investigators,  LOC 
CRM, SDMC Biostatistician, SDMC Clinical Coding and Safety Staff, HPTN LC, DAIDS 
personnel (in addition to the Medical Officer on the CMC) and other study team members   
as appropriate to evaluate the risk or problem and determine an appropriate response . The 
timelines and mechanisms for reporting and responding to such events will be described in the 
SSP.  
 
The study team will use regularly scheduled conference calls during the period of study 
implementation  to address safety concerns or unanticipated problems that have been  identified . 
Additional ad hoc  calls will be convened if required.  
 
Participant safety data is also monitored by [CONTACT_578997], who review 
incoming safety data for completeness and consistency on an ongoing basis . Events identified as 
questionable, inconsistent, or unexplained will be queried for verification.  
 
This study also will be monitored by a n HPTN SMC , which will meet at least annually to review 
safety and efficacy data . More frequent or ad hoc  reviews of safety data may be conduct ed by [CONTACT_578998].  The SMC may make recommendations based on review of safety and efficacy 
data.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_760703] be notified of any pregnancies identified at Enrollment or that occur among  
participants on study.  
 
All pregnancies should be followed until the final outcome can be determined. The appropriate 
case report form for pregnancy outcome and obstetric medical complications at the end of the 
pregnancy  may be completed , even after the participant is off study , up until the point that the 
study database is closed . As noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS], all  abnormal pregnancies outcomes will be 
reported to DAIDS in an expedited manner.   
 
Participants should be advised that not all contraceptive choices can prevent HIV transmission. 
Study participants who are sexually active with partners who are living with HIV or whose HIV 
status is unknown should be advised that they need to consider effective strategies for r educing 
the risk of HIV transmission . Participants should be instructed to discuss contraceptive choices 
and HIV risk reduction methods with their health care provider .  
 
Pregnancies that occur on study among participants taking ART or PrEP should be repor ted to 
The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. More information is available at www.apregistry.com .

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1 Review of Study Design  
 
This is a two -arm, controlled , individually randomized, open label  study that will include PWID  
living with HIV and PWID without HIV from five major cities in the US. The purpose of this 
study is to determine whether providing 26 weeks of peer navigation  with “one stop” integrated 
services in a mobile unit – particularly MOUD  for OUD and HIV treatment and prevention 
medications -- to PWID wi th OUD will improve uptake and adherence to MOUD  and uptake and 
adherence to ART or PrEP, compared to [ADDRESS_760704]  in each city . The individually randomized design used in thi s study (as compared 
to a cluster -randomized  design) will protect against co nfounding that could arise if cities in one 
arm of the trial were by [CONTACT_578999][INVESTIGATOR_578912] .

informed by [CONTACT_579002] . 
• Number of HIV-related deaths averted in the intervention arm and the active control arm  
in comparison to the background HIV-related deaths from county death indices  at 
baseline through week 52 . 
• Changes in hepatitis and STI acquisition for  PWID with OUD in the intervention arm 
and active control arm  in comparison to the background rates of hepatitis and STI

• Incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimate  
o per incident HIV case  
o per HIV-associated deat h, and   
o per QALY gained  comparing the intervention arm to the active control arm  
 
8.2.3 Process Endpoints  
 
Consistent with process objective (1) to assess  the time to provide MOUD treatment , ART and 
PrEP  in the intervention arm , the following endpoints will be assessed in the intervention arm:  
• Proportion of participants for whom MOUD was provided within 1 week of enrollment  
• Proportion of people living with HIV who were ART naïve or not currently on ART  
provided  ART w ithin 2 weeks of enrollment  
• Proportion of people without HIV who were provided with PrEP within 2 weeks of 
enrollment  
 
Consistent with process objective (2) to assess the proportion of participants in the intervention 
arm linked to community -based  MOUD, ART and PrEP  services at 26 weeks , the following 
endpoints will be assessed in the intervention arm:  
• Proportion of participants linked to MOUD at community -based services  by [CONTACT_68069] 26 
visit 
• Proportion of people living with HIV linked to care for HIV at community -based services  
by [CONTACT_68069] 26 visit  
• Proportion of people without HIV linked to care for PrEP at community -based ser vices  
by [CONTACT_68069] [ADDRESS_760705];39,40 we anticipate 25% uptake of MOUD, 
42.5% achieving viral suppression, and 5% uptake of PrEP in the control arm.  Sample  sizes are 
computed to provide 90% power to detect a fifteen percentage point difference in the proportion 
of participants achieving success, assuming a 5% type -I error rate (two -sided). A sample of [ADDRESS_760706] a 15 -point differenc e in MOUD  use (25% vs . 40%) between the 
active control and intervention arm at 26 week s. Approximately 216 people without  HIV would 
be needed to see a 15 -point difference in PrEP uptake (5% vs. 20%). To cover both HIV and 
MOUD  outcomes, 400 people without HIV will be needed . Approximately 10% of the study 
population is expected to be living with HIV – insufficient to accommodate a fully powered 
subgroup - but because this subgroup is expected to have very different rates of HIV -related 
success than the people without HIV subgroup, it will be important to analyze th ese participants 
separately . To assure 400 people without HIV, the target sample size will be augmented by 50 for 
a combined total of 450 participants , where 40 -50 of those are expected to be people living with 
HIV.  
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  57 of 99 
20 February 2023  8.4 Accrual and Retention  
 
The study cohort  (n=450) will be enrolled over the course of approximately 2.5 years and 
followed for 52 week s each . This corresponds to a rate of approximately 15 new enrollees per 
month, or, approximately 3 new enrollees per month at each of the five sites.  
 
8.5 Random Assignment/Study Arm Assignment  
 
Random treatment -arm allocation will occur at a 1:[ADDRESS_760707] interim reviews of study 
progress, including rates of participant accrual, visit retention, completion of primary and 
secondary endpoint collection, and, in a closed report, safety data by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. The frequency and 
content of SMC  reviews will be determined prior to the start of the study and outlined in the SSP 
Manual.  
 
8.8 Statistical  Analysis  
 
This section briefly describes the final study analyses. Detailed technical specifications of the 
statistical analyses will be described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
8.8.1 Primary Analyses  
 
All primary endpoint proportions will be compared across study arms using simple  linear -
binomial regression models (estimating risk differences) adjust ed for site (strata variable), with 
separate models for the people living with HIV and people without HIV subgroup s. Planned 
sample sizes should allow for Normal -based confidence interv als. No interim analyses are 
planned.  
 
8.8.2 Secondary Analyses  
 
Secondary analysis endpoint proportions will be compared using the identical method described 
for the comparison of proportions among primary endpoints  with th e exception of within-cohort 
change over time . Within -cohort change over time will be estimated using correlated -data 
binomial regression  (a random -effects model  estimating risk differences)  adjusted for city. 
Incidence rates will be computed as the number of incident events (includin g recurrent events 
where applicable) divided by [CONTACT_579004] -years in each study arm, where 
person time is computed for each person as the difference between enrollment date and the last 
available sample -collection date for which the corr esponding STI test was performed . Person -
time for participants with new HIV infection  will be calculated as the difference between 
enrollment date and date of first detection of HIV infection .  
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  58 of 99 
20 February 2023  Implementation Evaluation Analysis  
The analysis for each ob jective will be iterative, whereby [CONTACT_579005], themes, and patterns that emerge from the data pertaining 
to the PRISM framework’s  multi -level factors that influence the implementation proces s that will 
be used to define a set of analytic coding categories. Trained staff will iteratively code the 
qualitative data and employ qualitative analysis techniques. Quantitative data will be 
descriptively summarized.  The implementation evaluation analysis for each  implementation 
objective will be achieved via parallel mixed method data analysis, integrating qualitative and 
quantitative  results to triangulate and interpret overall findings.  
  
Results from pre -implementation analyses will inform the implementation of the intervention 
across study sites; implementation results will be used to systematically document site -specific 
refinements and document fidelity to the “one -stop” integrated strate gies delivered  in the mobile 
unit and supported by [CONTACT_578950] . Ultimately, it is hoped that results from the analysis phase 
can inform implementation of the study’s integrated healthcare services approach as a public 
health program to benefit PWID and to reduce drug -associated HIV transmission  in cities across 
the US. 
 
Modeling and Cost -Effectiveness  Analysis  
The modelling analysis will be conducted in two distinct phases. First, a stochastic  individual -
based model will be developed to simulate HIV acquisition among people without HIV and HIV 
transmission from people living with HIV for cohorts of PWID with OUD representative of the 
trial populations in the settings where HPTN [ADDRESS_760708] -effectiveness analysis of the integrated intervention will be 
performed  that will take into account the costs  of the full (integrated strategy) and limited ( active

9.0 HUMAN SUBJECTS CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 Ethical Review  
 
This protocol and the sample  informed consent forms (ICF s) contained in Appendi ces II and III 
will be revi ewed and approved by [CONTACT_579006].  
 
The protocol, site -specific ICF s, participa nt education and recruitment materials, and other 
requested documents — and any subsequent modifications — also will be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_579007].  
 
Subsequent to initial review and approval, the IRB will review the protocol at least annually . The 
investigator s will make safety and progress reports to the IRB at least annually, and within three 
months of study termination or completion . These reports will include the total number of 
participants enrolled in the study, the number of participants who completed the  study, all 
changes in the research activity, and must comply with the requirements of 45 CFR 46.108(a)(4) 
and 21 CFR 56.108b for promptly reporting the following: all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to human subjects or others ;; serious or continui ng noncompliance with applicable 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  59 of 99 
20 February 2023  regulations or the requirements or determinations of their IRBs/ECs; and any suspension o r 
termination of IRB approval . In addition, all open SMC  reports will be provided to the IRB.  
Study sites will submit documentation of  continuing review to the DAIDS Protocol Registration 
Office, in accordance with the current DAIDS Protocol Registration Policy and Procedure 
Manual.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_760709] additional conse nt requirements based upon local requirements, e.g., for clinical care, 
privacy protection, etc.  
 
Literate participants will document their provision of informed consent by [CONTACT_579008]. Non -literate participants will be asked to d ocument their informed consent by 
[CONTACT_579009] (e.g., with an X, thumbprint, or other mark) in the presence of a literate third -
party witness . (Further details regarding DAIDS requirements for documenting the informed 
consent process with both literate and non -literate participants are provided in the DAIDS 
Standard Operating Procedure for Source Documentation.) Any other IRB requirements for 
obtaining informed consent from non -literate persons also will be followed .  
 
Participants will be provided with cop ies of their ICFs if they are willing to receive them .  
 
9.[ADDRESS_760710] participants’ confidentiality during the study, however,  it is 
possible that others may learn of a person’s participation in this study and may think that the 
participant is living with HIV or at high risk for acquiring HIV or may make assumptions about 
the participant’s use of drugs . If participants communicat e with a peer navigator using texting or 
messaging apps and others are able to access their phone, this could be a confidentiality risk . This 
will be highlighted in the consent process . The participant could face stigma related to HIV or 
drug use . Particip ants may be nervous while waiting for HIV or other test results . If the tests 
show that a participant has HIV or another infection, they may worry about their health and 
future.  The questions we will ask participants about sexual behavior , medical history,  drug use 
and drug treatment history, history of being incarcerated, and experiences of depression, anxiety 
or trauma  may make them feel uneasy . Train ed counselors will be available to help participants 
deal with these feelings.  
 
There are no  risks  related to  investigational products in this study  because no investigational 
products will be used . 
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760711] six months of  their participation in 
the study . The medications that a participant might be dispensed in the mobile unit  include t hose 
to treat or prevent : STIs  or other bacterial infections , HIV, opi[INVESTIGATOR_578917] . 
Particip ants may also be prescribed other medications as part of primary care provided in the 
mobile health delivery unit . The clinician will explain to the participant any side effects of the 
specific medications they are prescribed  or given . 
 
9.4 Benefits  
 
Participa nts in this study will receive many health services at no charge . Participants will be 
tested for HIV, HAV, HBV, HCV , and other STIs. Participants  will receive treatment or referral 
for treatment, as appropriate, for these infections . The counseling participants receive  during this 
study may help them  avoid HIV , HAV, HBV, HCV, and other STIs . For participants with  HIV, 
counseling may help them  learn  how to better care for themselves and avoid passing HIV to 
sexual partners (or  their fetus, if pregnant) . People without HIV will be offered PrEP or referral 
for PrEP to help avoid HIV  infect ion. Peer navigator s will work to link participants to health 
services, including treatment for OUD and HIV care or prevention services . Participants  will 
receive free condoms and naloxone kits for overdose reversal . Participants in the group that 
receives medical services in the mobile unit  will be provided with medical care and medication in 
a single convenient location .  
 
Participants may receive indirect benefits from this study . The information gathered during this 
study may show how medical services can be provided more successfully to people who inject 
drugs, particularly services for OUD and HIV . This could influence how medical services are 
provided in the future and may be beneficial to participants and their community .  
 
9.5 Population -Specific Considerations  
 
As noted in Section 1.1, p ersons with OUD and living with or at risk for HIV in the US typi[INVESTIGATOR_578918] . In 
HPTN  094, prisoners will not be recruited or enrolled from jail  or prison  settings (persons with  
parole status will be recruited and enrolled), nor will s tudy-related visits with study participants 
be conducted in prisons or jails . Participants who become incarcerated during their time on study 
will be schedule d for study activities for which they are eligible upon release.  
 
As noted in Sections 1. 2 and 4.3 of this protocol, approximately 25% of the participants in this 
study will be women . It is expect ed that some number of these participants will be or will become 
pregnant while enrolled in the study . The “Common Rule” for conduct of human research studies 
funded by [CONTACT_579010] , particularly re garding benefits and risk s to both t he pregnant individual  and the ir 
fetus . 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  61 of 99 
20 February 2023  In considering the risks and benefits presented by [CONTACT_579011], the intervention being investigated is the combination  of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_578919] (or at risk for) HIV, in a  mobile  health delivery unit , with 
peer navigation. The medications that will be prescribed and provided are not  investigational  but 
will be US FDA -approved  medicines commonly used to treat or prevent these conditions . 
Providing these standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , in a manner that we expect will improve their uptake and 
adherence ( i.e., in an accessible mobile health delivery unit , with supportive navigation) , will not 
increase risks to either a pregnant individual or to the fetus  greater than would be encountered if 
they were to obtain them  in a standard clinic setting .  
 
The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_578920]-benefit profile for both the pregnant person 
and the fetus . For ART, treatment  in a pregnant person is highly effective at preventing 
transmission of HIV to the fetus and  treatment has health benefits for the pregnant ind ividual 
(current guidelines recommend treatment for all adults  living with HIV for their own health ), with  
very low  risk presented to either pregnant person or fetus by [CONTACT_579012] . For PrEP, 
both the pregnant person  and the fetus benefit from avoiding  potential HIV infection , and  the 
currently  approved PrEP  regimen  (Truvada)  has a very well -studied and minimal risk profile . For 
MOUD, there are  substantial  benefits to treatment for both the pregnant person  and the fetus 
compared with the harms from untreated opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] . A pregnant person on treatment 
spares themselves and the developi[INVESTIGATOR_578921] -related risks that occur from  cycles of use and withdrawal of street -acquired opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] . 
MOUD  reduces the dysregulated behavior  of addiction, allowing the person to improve nutrition, 
sleep, situational stability, attend pre -natal care visits, etc., with corresponding benefits for the 
fetus. Recommendations  for treatment will always be based on the clinician’s assessment of the 
individual participant’s needs; if a particular therapy (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone)  
is deemed not appropriate for a  particular  participant (pregna nt or otherwise), it will not be 
prescribed .  
 
In the risk -to-benefit analysis, benefits of offering this intervention to pregnant people far 
outweigh potential risks for both the pregnant person and the fetus . Excluding pregnant people 
would present ethica l challenges , principal among them violating th e principle of beneficence by 
[CONTACT_579013] 
(including medications) in this study  in the face of no more than minimal risks to pregnant people 
and their fetuses treated using these medications . As well , including pregnant people allows the  
study population  to be more representative of the population of PWID with OUD , and therefore 
allows our findings to be more genera lizable.  
 
9.6 Incentives  
 
Pending IRB approval, participants will be compensated for their time and effort in this study, 
and/or be reimbursed for travel to study visits and time away from work. As well, some 
participants may be offered additional compensation for referring other P WID who enroll in the 
study . Site-specific reimbursement amounts will be specified in the study ICFs.

Notes: Some tests will be performed in mobile units and some will be performed in local 
laboratories (see SSP Manual). Other testing related to HIV and HCV infection may be 
performed for clinical management (see Appendix 1A).  
Each study site (mobile  health delivery unit , clinic, laboratory , etc.) must  adhere to standards of 
Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP)  
(https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/gclp.pdf ) referenced in the HPTN Manual of 
Operations (MOP), the SSP Manual and local SOPs for proper collection, processing, labeling, 
transport, and storage of specimens to the local laboratory. In addition, each study site must 
adhere to the Requirements for DAIDS Funded and or Sponsored Laboratories in Clinical Trials 
Policy ( https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/Lab -Appendix -I-US-Labs.pdf ). Specimen 
collection, testing, and storage at the local laboratory will be documented using the HPTN 
Laboratory Data Management System (LDMS) as described in the SSP Manual.  
 
10.2 HPTN Laboratory Center Specimens  
 
The following types of specimens will be collected /prepared  for testing at the HPTN LC.  
 
• Plasma  
• Serum  
• Urine  
• DBS  
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_760714] one year after publication of the 
primary findings of the study and all protocol -related testing has been performed . A subset of the 
stored samples will be shipped to the HPTN LC (located in the US) for QA and other 
assessments. Stored samples may be used to evaluate the performance of laboratory methods 
relevant to protocol objectives. As indicated below, testing on stored samples will be performed 
by [CONTACT_579017].  These sa mples may not be used 
for local laboratory testing without written approval by [CONTACT_579018].   
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  64 of 99 
20 February 2023  10.2.2  Virology  
 
For participants with HIV infection, HPTN LC testing will include HIV viral load, and analysis 
of viral subtypes/strains, drug resistance, and duration of infection;  other tests may be performed 
to characterize the host response to HIV infection. Results will not be returned to the sites or 
study participants, with the exception of  HIV testing (if results obtained at the HPTN LC do not 
agree with site results) .  
For participants with HCV infection, HPTN LC  testing may include HCV viral load, and analysis 
of HCV strains, drug resistance, and duration of infection; other tests may be performed to 
characterize the host response to HCV infection. Results will not be returned to the sites or study 
participants .  
HIV r esistance testing will be performed at the HPTN LC or a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_579019]. This testing will be performed retrospectively at the end of the study. Results  of this 
testing will not be returned to study sites. Because real -time resistance testing may be needed for 
clinical management in the event of HIV infection, each site will have an SOP as to how they will 
accomplish real -time local or regional resistance  testing to assist with clinical decision making; 
separate specimens should be collected for that testing.  
 
Phylogenetic analysis may also be performed to evaluate the genetic relationships between HIV 
strains. This may include analysis of clustered/linke d HIV infections, transmission dynamics, and 
the association of behavioral, demographic, and clinical factors with HIV 
transmission/acquisition. This analysis may also include evaluation of the multiplicity of infection 
and HIV superinfection. Similar anal ysis may also be performed to characterize HCV infections 
and the relationship between HIV and HCV infections.  
 
Laboratory testing will be performed to assess the prevalence of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_760715] been validated and approved by [CONTACT_579020] 
(CPQA) Committee. Results will not be returned to the study participants.  
 
Stored plasma may also be tested for the presence of other drugs , including  ARV drugs used f or 
HIV treatment or other reasons  and drugs used for hepatitis treatment . Stored samples  may be 
tested for the presence of  medications used to treat substance use,  other concomitant medications , 
and substances of abuse . 
 
 
 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  65 of 99 
20 February 2023  10.3 Quality Control and Quality Assurance Procedures  
 
The clinical sites will document that their clinical laboratories (including clinic laboratories, 
mobile units, or other locations where processing and testing are performed) have either  a 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amend ments of 1988 (CLIA) -waiver or are CLIA -certified 
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments  of 1988 (CLIA -certified) and/or 
participate in DAIDS sponsored external quality assurance  programs . Laboratories must also 
follow the DAIDS requirements (link to policy on DAIDS website 
https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/daids -clinical -research -laboratory -specimens -management).  
 
LC staff will conduct periodic visits to each site to review the implementation of on -site 
laboratory QC procedures, including p roper maintenance of laboratory equipment and use of 
appropriate supplies and reagents. LC staff will follow up directly with site staff to resolve any 
QC or QA problems identified through proficiency testing or on -site visit reviews . Throughout 
the course  of the study, the HPTN LC will select a random sample of stored specimens to test for 
QA purposes. LC staff will follow -up directly with site staff to resolve any QA problems 
identified through this process .  
 
HIV diagnostic tests will be listed on the US lab information sheet and will be subject to review 
and acceptance by [CONTACT_579021] .  
 
Throughout the course of the study, the SDMC will work with the HPTN LC to determine and  
select  random sample of st ored specimens to test for QA purposes , and to assist with and/or 
confirm HIV seroconversion cases .  
 
The SDMC and/or the LC will inform site staff of the samples selected for QA testing, and site 
staff will ship the selected specimens to the LC. The LC wi ll perform HIV diagnostic testing for 
QC, endpoint confirmation, end of study confirmation, and will work with the SDMC to compare 
the results of their tests with the results obtained by [CONTACT_579022] . LC staff will follow -up directly 
with site staff to r esolve any QA problems identified through this process.  
 
10.4 QC for HIV Diagnostic Testing  
 
The local laboratories  will perform testing for HIV diagnosis at Screening, Enrollment, and other 
scheduled visits  as described in the SSP Manual . HIV status will be co nfirmed at study sites using 
local HIV testing guidelines  or following the advice from the CMC/HPTN LC . In addition, if a 
participant has signs or symptoms consistent with acute HIV infection, or expresses a concern 
about recent HIV acquisition, testing wi ll be performed using an RNA test such as the Aptima 
HIV-1 Qualitative Assay . Regardless of whether HIV RNA testing is used for diagnostic testing, 
incident HIV infection (seroconversion events) must be confirmed in all cases using two 
independent samples collected on different days. HIV algorithms for HIV diagnostic testing are 
provided in the SSP Manual. The HPTN LC will perform QC testing to confirm seroconversion 
events and evaluate the accura cy of site test results.  
 
10.5 HIV RNA Monitoring  
 
Quantitative HIV RNA (viral load) testing will be performed at local clinical laboratories to 
monitor HIV infection in any subject with confirmed HIV infection. Viral load testing will be 
performed in people li ving with HIV at the visit when HIV infection is confirmed, and at 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760716] through 
the end of the study  (this includes completion of all protocol -related testing, including testing at 
the HPTN LC) . Sample destruction requires approval in writing from the LC to the site and will 
not occur until at least one year has passed after publication of the primary manuscript . In 
addition, study participants will be asked to provide written informed consent for their specimens 
to be stored after testing for all protocol -related testing has been compl eted (including testing for 
primary, secondary, and exploratory objectives)  for possible future testing. The specimens of 
participants who do not consent to long -term storage and additional testing will be destroyed at 
the end of the study  after the protoc ol-related testing has been completed, at least one year after 
completion of the primary manuscript. A list of samples to be destroyed will be provided by [CONTACT_477196], to be reviewed and reconciled by [CONTACT_779]. Final approval for sample destruction will be 
provided in writing to the site by [CONTACT_208025] . 
 
10.[ADDRESS_760717] with 
contaminated needles, blood, and blood products, appropriate blood and secretion precautions 
will be employed by [CONTACT_43613][INVESTIGATOR_43558], as currently recommended by [CONTACT_132791] . All specimens will be 
shipped using packaging that meets requirements specified by [CONTACT_579023] 3373, Biological Substance, Category B, and 
Packing Instruction 650 .  
 
11.0 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
 
11.1 Protocol Registration  
 
Initial Registration of the protocol by [CONTACT_420023] (PRO) is required 
prior to implementation of this protocol . As part of this process, each site must have the protocol 
and protocol ICF(s) approved, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_1201]. Upon receiving final approval, sites 
will submit all required protocol registrat ion documents to the DAIDS PRO at the RSC . The 
DAIDS PRO will review the submitted protocol registration packet to ensure that all of the 
required documents have been received . In the case of Initial Registration, site -specific ICFs will 
be reviewed and ap proved by [CONTACT_68410]. Sites will receive an Initial Registration 
Notification from the DAIDS PRO that indicates successful completion of the protocol 
registration process. A copy of the Initial Registration Notification should be retained in the site's 
regulatory files.  
 
Upon receiving final IRB/EC and any other applicable RE approval(s) for an amendment, sites 
should implement the amendment immediately . Sites are required to submit an amendment 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.[ADDRESS_760718] been received. Site -
specific ICF(s) WILL NOT be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_579024] w hen the DAIDS PRO receives a complete registration 
packet. A copy of the Amendment Registration Notification should be retained in the site's 
regulatory files.  
 
For additional information on the protocol registration process and specific documents required  
for initial and amendment registrations, refer to the current version of the DAIDS Protocol 
Registration Manual, which can be found at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -
protocol -registration -policy -and-procedures -manual . 
 
11.2 Study Activation  
 
Pending successful protocol registration and submission of all required documents, the HPTN 
LOC staff will “activate” a site  to begin study operations . Study implementation may not be 
initiated until a study activation notice is provided to the site by [CONTACT_132794]. In addition, if 
study activation is determined to be necessary for any subsequent  amendments, study 
implementation may not be initiated until a study activation notice is provided to the site by [CONTACT_579025].  
 
11.3 Study Coordination  
 
Study implementation will be directed by [CONTACT_132796] . The SSP 
Manual  will contain links to the Requirements for Source Documentation in DAIDS Funded 
and/or Sponsored Clinical Trials, as well as the DAIDS Toxicity Tables . This manual will  outline 
procedures for conducting study visits; data and forms processing; SAE assessment, management 
and reporting; dispensing medications and documenting product accountability; and other study 
operations.  
   
Study CRFs and other study i nstruments will be developed by [CONTACT_420025] . Data will be submitted to the HPTN SDMC for cleaning, reporting and analysis. Quality 
control data queries will be generated on a routine schedule for verification and resolution  by [CONTACT_579026] .  
 
Close coordination between protocol team members will be necessary to track study progress, 
respond to queries about proper study implementation, and address other issues in a timely 
manner. Rates of accrual, adherence, follow -up, and SAE incidence will be monitored closely by 
[CONTACT_579027] . The CMC  will address issues related to study eligibility and 
SAE  management and reporting as needed to assure consistent case management, documentation, 
and information -sharing ac ross sites.  
 
11.4 Study Monitoring  
 
Monitoring  will be performed in accordance with DAIDS policies . Study monitors will visit the 
site to:  
 
• Verify compliance with human subjects and other research regulations and guidelines;  
• Assess adherence to the study proto col, study -specific procedures manual, and local 
counseling practices; and  
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  68 of 99 
20 February 2023  • Confirm the quality and accuracy of information collected at the study site and entered 
into the study database.  
 
Site investigators will allow study monitors to inspect study facil ities and documentation (e.g., 
ICFs, clinic and laboratory records, other source documents, paper or electronic CRFs), as well as 
observe the performance of study procedures. Investigators also will allow inspection of all study -
related documentation by [CONTACT_579028], HPTN SDMC, HPTN 
LC, NIAID, NIDA,  IRB, and US regulatory authorities (Office for Human Research Protections 
(OHRP) and other regulatory agencies). A site visit log will be maintained at each study site to 
document a ll visits.  
 
Monitoring visits may be conducted on -site or remotely. Remote visits may include 
remote source document verification using methods specified for this purpose by 
[CONTACT_18127]. Remote monitoring visits may be performed in place of, or in addition to onsite 
visits to ensure the safety of study participants and data integrity41 . The site must make 
available study documents for site monitors to review utilizing a secure platform that is 
HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. The Data Management Center will configure 
Medidata Remote Source Review (RSR) and make it available to all sites . We encourage 
Sites to use the DMC provided Medidata RSR platform but other potential platform 
options include: Veeva SiteVault, site -controlled SharePoint or cloud -based portal, and 
direct acce ss to Electronic Medical Record (EMR). Other secure platforms that are 21 
CFR Part 11 compliant may be utilized, as allowed by [CONTACT_295200] (OCSO).

INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to take part in a research study  for people who inject drugs (PWID) with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) who are either without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or who 
are living with HIV  which means  you may either be at risk for getting HIV or could pass HIV on 
to others . HIV is the virus which causes acquired immunodefic iency syndrome (AIDS) . This 
research study will help us see whether providing medical services in a mobile unit will help 
PWID start and stay on anti -HIV medicines and medicines for opi[INVESTIGATOR_578940].

1. You should know key information about this study before you join .  
 
Here is a summary of important information about the study:  
 
• This is a research study.  Research is not the same as routine treatment or medical care. The 
purpose of a research study is to answer scientific questions. These answers can help find better 
ways to deliver treatment and improve knowledge of human behavior . 
• Your participation in this study is voluntary.  You may refuse to join, or you may withdraw your 
consent to be in the study,  at any time,  for any reason .  
• We are doing this study to see whether providing medical services in a mobile unit will help 
PWID start and stay on opi[INVESTIGATOR_578941] -HIV medications.  
• About  450 PWID either without HIV or who are living with HIV will participate in this study 
from  cities in the [LOCATION_002]. Participants will be in the study for about one year.  
• We will collect blood , urine , and swabs from you at study visits to test for sexually transmitted 
infections (STIs). Collecting blood samples may cause pain, bruise your arm or make you feel 
lightheaded.  
• We will test you for HIV , hepatitis A, B, and C  and STIs during  the study. You will receive 
treatment or referral for treatment as appropriate. The STIs we will test for are Chlamydia, 
gonorrhea, and syphilis . There are other STIs, but we will not test for them as part of this study.  
• Before a study visit or at the sta rt of a visit, we will assess you for COVID -19. If you are 
suspected to  have COVID -19, you will need to wait until it is safe for you to be seen by [CONTACT_579033].  
• You may be provided medication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (MOUD) and anti -HIV medications for 
HIV treatment or prevention , or you will be  referred to places where you can get these 
medications . 
• There may be some social risks. You may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable with some of the 
questions you will be asked, some of the procedures that will be done, or some of the test results 
that you will receive.  
• We will make every effort to protect your confidentiality during the study. However, it is possible 
that others may learn that you are part of this study.  
• The counseling you receive during this study may help you to avoid HIV , hepatitis A, B, and C  
and other STIs.  
• If you join this study you will receive many health services at no charge while you are 
participating in the research . As well,  the information gathered during this study may help to 
develop ways to prevent HIV and other STIs and to increase use of treatment for OUD  among 
PWID and their partners  in your community .

2. The study is testing a program to provide care for HIV and opi[INVESTIGATOR_578942] a 
mobile health delivery unit  (“mobile unit”) . 
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_578943] . Injecting drugs can put people at 
high risk for getting HIV or passing HIV on to others . It can be difficult for people who inject opi[INVESTIGATOR_578944] . These clinics can be hard to get to and sometimes 
people have to go to multiple clinics to get all the services they need . We want to see whether providing 
multiple services in one location —the mobile unit—in a convenient place will make it easier to get 
treatme nt for OUD  and HIV prevention and treatment . Medications offered in the mobile unit will be the 
same medications used in the regular clinics in this city . The only difference will be that they are provided 
in the mobile unit. This study may show a new way to improve the health of PWID .  
 
3. Participants will be placed in 1 of 2 groups.  
 
All participants will be assigned to one of two groups by [CONTACT_17793] (the equivalent of flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
coin). The difference between the groups is that the first  group will receive health care services  delivered 
on a mobile unit. These services include MOUD , HIV testing, HIV treatment for people living with HIV 
and not in care, pre -exposure proph ylaxis (PrEP) for people who do not have HIV, and STI testing and 
treatment. The second group will have their initial Screening and Enrollment Visits in the mobile unit, but 
all other visits will occur in regular  clinics  in the area .  
 
Participants in both groups will be assigned a peer navigator  for [ADDRESS_760736] participants  in 
accessing and remaining in medical care.  
 
All participants will come in for study assessments at approximately six and 12 months after starting the 
study and will be in the study for about a  year total.

results of the study  will be available .  
 
Visits with Your Peer navigator  
You will work with a peer navigator  during the first six months of the study . Your peer navigator  will 
help you address issues that may have made it hard for you to get care in the past. They will act as a coach 
to help you stay motivated in treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_578946] . They will 
remind you of medical appointments you have and help you find medical and other resources available to 
you in your community.  
 
You will mostly work with your navigator in -person at the start of the six months . Over time you may 
work together more over the phone/through messaging apps . If you ar e in the group that receives medical 
care in the mobile unit , your navigator will help you transition your medical care to a clinic or clinics in 
your community  before the six months  is over. If you are in the group that does not get medical care in 
the mobile unit , your navigator will work with you to get medical care at a clinic or clinics in your 
community right from the start.  
 
How often you interact with your navigator and how long these interactions last will depend on your 
needs . We expect you will b e in contact [CONTACT_579037].  
 
Medical Care Visits in the Mobile Unit  
If you are put in the group that will receive m edical  care in the mobile unit , you will have multiple visits 
to the mobile unit  over the first six months of  the study . How often you have visits and how long they last 
will depend on your medical needs . This may change over time.  
 
Note that if you already receive medical care from providers in the community and are happy with this 
care, you do not have to switc h to care in the mobile unit . You can also choose to get some care in the 
mobile unit  and other care from regular clinics in the community.  
 
A primary goal of the care you receive in the mobile unit  will be to provide you with medical treatment 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] . The medications  expected to be used in this Study will be buprenorphine or 
combination buprenorphine/naloxone . The Study Team will work with the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration at national and local levels to comply with policies for dispensation of buprenorphine and 
buprenorphine/naloxone to participants. Another primary goal is  to provide you with HIV treatment  
(ART) if you are living with HIV or to provide you with HIV prevention (PrEP) if you are not living with 
HIV.  
 
What happens at a medical care visit will depend on your medical needs at the time . We would expect 
that they would include at least some of the  following:

• Begin HIV treatment if you are living with HIV. Offer PrEP i f you are without HIV.  
• Provide medications to treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].  
• Provide referral for vaccinations for hepatitis A and B.  
• Provide referral for treatment, if you have  hepatitis B or C.  
• Collect ~ XX mL (about x teaspoons) [ sites to complete ] of blood for HIV testing if you are not 
already known to be living with HIV and to test your blood for STIs. We will test the level of 
HIV virus in your blood (viral load) and the health of your blood (CD4 cell count) if you have 
HIV.  
• Collect urine to test for drug use, and to check for pregnancy (if you are someone who can 
become pregnant) .  
• Collect swabs from you to test for STIs.  Thes e swabs may be taken from the throat, rectum and 
vagina .

10. If you stop participating in peer navigation, or stop receiving OUD or HIV care or 
prevention, we will ask you to stay in the study.  
 
We hope that if you join this study, you will work with your peer navigator  for the full six 
months . We also hope that you will start  and stay on treatment for OUD and receive HIV 
treatment or prevention for the full six months (in the mobile unit  if that is your group). But if 
you stop these activities for any reason, we still ask you to continue to come for the study visits  at 
[ADDRESS_760742] positive for HIV while you are in the study you will stop taking PrEP if you started PrEP . You  will be 
asked to come back to provide  an additional  ~XX mL (about x teaspoons) [ sites to complete ] blood to 
 
 
HPTN 094, Final Version 2.0  87 of 99 
20 February 2023  confirm the  HIV result  and to provide additional samples for other assessments . You will also be asked to 
complete the remaining study visits (26 and/or 52 weeks).  We will provide or help you find the care and 
support you need . You will still continue to receive peer navigation through six months and will continue 
to receive medical care in the mobile unit , if you are in the group that receives care in the mobile unit . 
 
12. We will test yo u for pregnancy during the study if you are someone who can become 
pregnant.  
 
We will collect urine to test for pregnancy and will give you these results each time. I f you become 
pregnant during the study, you will be able to stay in the study as original ly planned. If you are pregnant 
at the last study visit, we will contact [CONTACT_579038].  
 
Even if you are in the group to receive medical care in the mobile unit , the study cannot provide all the 
medical care you wi ll need for a pregnancy or delivery of a baby. The baby [CONTACT_439517]. 
Therefore, it is important to receive medical care for a pregnancy outside the study. We will tell you 
where you can go for the care you need.  
 
If you are taking ART or PrEP and become pregnant, we will  provide some basic information about your 
pregnancy, such as what medications you took while pregnant, what prenatal care you received, and the 
outcome of your pregnancy, to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. None of your personal information, 
such as your name [CONTACT_190970], will be provided to the registry. You can learn more about this registry at 
www.apregistry.com.  
 
13. Some of your blood and urine may be left over at the end of the study and may be used for 
future research, if you provide consent.  
  
Some of your blood and urine collected for this study may be left over after all of the study tests are 
completed. If you agree, these  stored samples may also be used for future research related to HIV 
infection, hepatitis infection, COVID -19, and other in fections, and to better understand laboratory tests 
related to this study . This research will not include whole genome sequencing also known as WGS.  
 
You will be asked to sign this consent form to give permission to use your stored samples for future 
resea rch. Even if you do not give permission to store your blood for possible future research, you can still 
be in this study. If you give permission, you will not be asked to give permission again during  the study . 
However, you may withdraw your consent to use  your stored samples for future research at any time. We 
will then destroy your samples after all of the study -related testing has been completed. If you agree to

history of being in jail or prison, experiences of depression, anxiety or trauma  may make 
you feel uneasy . However, you do not have to answer any question that you do not want to and 
you can stop answering the questions at any time.  
 
SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS  
 
If you are assigned to the group that will NOT  receive medical care in the mobile health delivery u nit, 
you may receive medications from the study staff at the Enrollment Visit. These will be medications to 
treat STIs, if you have STI symptoms at the Enrollment Visit. The clinician will explain to you any side 
effects associated with those medications . After the Enrollment Visit, yo ur peer navigator  will help you  
receive care at the regularly  available clinics  in your community . The staff at those facilities can explain 
to you the side effects of any medications they give to you or prescribe  for you . You will also be offered 
naloxone kit s during your study participation that can be used to treat an overdose . The side effects of 
naloxone will be explained to you.  
 
If you are assigned to the group that WILL  receive medical care in the mobile unit , you will receive or 
be prescribed medications by [CONTACT_579040] . 
The drugs you could be given on the mobile  unit include medications to treat  or prevent  STIs  or other 
bacterial infections , hepatitis, HIV, opi[INVESTIGATOR_578947] e. You may  also be prescribed 
medications that you will need to pi[INVESTIGATOR_452629] a pharmacy . The clinician will explain to you the side effects

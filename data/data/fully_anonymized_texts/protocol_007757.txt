Short Title Targeting RV in PAH  
Study Design This study is a randomized, double-bli nd, placebo controlled, multi-center 
proof-of-concept study in 10 male or female subjects with pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and RV dysfunction.   Subjects who meet the protocol 
definition of RV dysfun ction (CMR RVEF <45%) will be randomized to 
ranolazine or placebo 2:1.  
 
The study includes a screening period (up to 4 weeks), a treatment period (up 
to 26 weeks 1 month), and a follow-up period (4 weeks).  Subjects in the 
treatment period will be called about ever y 4 weeks to assess any changes in 
health or medications as well as study drug compliance.   
Subjects will receive ranolazine or placebo at 500mg PO BID and after two 
weeks will increase to 1000mg PO BID.  Subjects will continue at 1000mg BID for the duration of the study.  Subjects with adverse reactions that are difficult 
to tolerate will be down titrated to 500mg BID. Subjects on moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors will be limited to 500mg BID. 
At baseline (week 0), interim ([ADDRESS_842793] randomization) and the 
conclusion of the treatment period (w eek 26) subjects will be assessed for 
functional class, 6- MWD, and HEALTH OUTCOME based on SF-36 tool. 
Peripheral blood will be obtained for metabolic profiling at baseline and the 
conclusion of the treatment period.  Cardiovascular MRI (CMR) will be performed at baseline and the conclusion  of the treatment period.  Baseline 
CMR may be done per standard of care or as a research scan.

and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference 
on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government r egulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
2.[ADDRESS_842797] transition from 
compensated hypertrophy to dilatation and failure in  the RV remain enigmatic. Much of our understanding 
is based on cell culture and animal models or is extra polated from data of left vent ricular (LV) dysfunction. 
Reflected by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-expression of fetal-type contractile proteins, angiogenic rarefaction, and alterations in 
calcium handling, numerous molecular signaling pathways  are thought to be activated in RV dysfunction, 
leading to increased levels of reactive oxygen (R OS) or nitrogen (RNS) species, inflammation, RV 
ischemia, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and decr eased contractility, as recently reviewed1. However, further 
mechanistic insight into the progression of RV dysfunction has been hampered by [CONTACT_631530]. Moreover, substantial differences exist among animal models of PAH and human PAH2, making 
animal-derived insights suboptimal and sometime s misleading regarding PAH and RV dysfunction in 
human subject populations. Thus, the development of ta rgeted therapeutics in RV failure has been slow. 
 More recently, animal modeling of RVH and RV failure in PAH has revealed a substantial down-regulation 
of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in favor of glycolysis (GL). The molecular mechanisms controlling 
this metabolic shift in the RV are unclear
3, but, in part, may involve alterations of potassium channel 
function4-6. Importantly, in rodents with experimental PAH7, 8 or chronic RV overload9, RVH, RV electrical 
remodeling, and RV dysfunction can be normalized with dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) which in turn activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to favor oxidative 
metabolism. These findings suggest that alteration s in mitochondrial function, metabolism, and energy 
substrate utilization are keys to understanding the progression to RV failure. Observational human data 
through PET corroborate these findings by [CONTACT_631531]-dependent RV 
dysfunction10, 11. Yet, a true causative mechanism of metabolic  dysregulation for RV dysfunction in human 
PAH has not been established. Furthermore, data are spar se regarding the efficacy and safety profile of 
DCA in humans, and it is currently not an FDA-approved medication. Alternatively, ranolazine, which is 
currently used for refractory myocardial ischemia12, 13, also activates PDH14-[ADDRESS_842798] substantial therapeutic 
potential in RV dysfunction and PAH, and could be read ily “re-purposed” as an already FDA-approved 
medication.  
 
In addition to PDH, other metabolic factors likely exist that are dy sregulated in RV failure and primarily 
drive pathogenesis. Historically, RV failure had been described as a stereotyped response to 
hemodynamic overload. More recent large patient cohort data suggests that RV, independently from 
PAP, predicts mortality18. Thus, a recent hypothesis suggests that individual genetic differences 
dysregulate cardiomyocyte function and, in doing so, pr edispose to RV failure in humans, control patient-
specific manifestations of diseas e, and thus would represent key diagnostic markers and therapeutic 
targets. While deficiencies in BMPR219-[ADDRESS_842799] been found to be altered in RV failure, any one of 
which could contribute to individual predisposition to RV failure. Based on their established functions in 
left ventricular injury and metabolism25 and known alterations in right ventricular failure26, changes in 
microRNA (miRNA) expr ession, which are small, non-coding  RNA that negatively regulate gene 
expression, could also underlie such a predisposition to metabolic dysfunction of the RV. Furthermore, 
similar to secreted metabolites, miRNA c ould be released from injured myocardium27 and could thus

serve as disease biomarkers. Howe ver, the lack of a clear familial pattern of inheritance of RV 
dysfunction, accompanied by [CONTACT_631532],  limits the utility of large scale 
genomic sequencing or genome wide association study al one to identify the existence of these factors.  
 
2.2 Investigational Agent  
2.2.1 Description 
Ranexa™ (ranolazine) is available as an ex tended-release tablet for oral administration. 
Ranolazine is a racemic mixture and chemic ally described as 1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_631509], N -(2,6-
dimethylphenyl)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)pr opyl]-, (±)-. It has an empi[INVESTIGATOR_299754] 
C24H33N3O4, a molecular weight of 427.54 g/mole , and the following structural formula: 
 
Ranolazine is a white to off-white solid. Ranolazine is  soluble in dichloromethane and methanol; sparingly 
soluble in tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, acetonitrile, and aceton e; slightly soluble in ethyl acetate, isopropanol, 
toluene, and ethyl ether; and very slightly soluble in water. 
Ranexa is available for oral administration as film-c oated, extended-release tabl ets containing 500 mg of 
ranolazine. Inactive ingredients of the 500 mg tabl et include carnauba wax, hypromellose, magnesium 
stearate, methacrylic acid  copolymer (Type C), microcrystalline ce llulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 
80, sodium hydroxide, titanium dioxide, and FD&C Yellow #[ADDRESS_842800], a measure of myoc ardial work, at maximal exercise. 
2.2.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Ranolazine is extensively metabolized in gut and liver and its absorption is highly variable. For example, 
at a dose of 1000 mg b.i.d., the mean steady state C max was 2569 ng/mL; 95% of C max values were 
between 420 and 6080 ng/mL. The pharmacokinetics of t he (+) R and (-) S-enantiomers of ranolazine are 
similar in healthy volunteers. The apparent terminal  half-life of ranolazine is 7 hours. Steady-state is 
generally achieved within 3 days of b.i.d. dosing with  Ranexa. At steady-state over the dose range 500 to 
1000 mg b.i.d., C max and AUC 0-τ increase slightly more than proporti onally to dose, 2.2- and 2.4-fold, 
respectively. With twice daily dosing, the peak/trough ratio of the ranolazine plasma concentration is 1.6 
to 3.0. 
2.2.4 Absorption and Distribution 
After oral administration of Ranexa peak plasma conc entrations of ranolazine are reached between 2 and 
5 hours. After oral administration of 14C-ranolazine as a solution, 73% of the dose is systemically 
available as ranolazine or metabolites. The bioavailabilit y of ranolazine from Ranexa relative to that from 
a solution of ranolazine is 76%. Because ranolazine is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), inhibitors of 
P-gp may increase the absorption of ranolazine. 
 

Targeting RV in PAH  Page 11 
Version1  
 
Food (high fat breakfast) has no important effect on the C max and AUC of ranolazine. Therefore, Ranexa 
may be taken without regard to meals. Over the co ncentration range of 0.25 to 10 µg/mL, ranolazine is 
approximately 62% bound to human plasma proteins. 
2.2.5 Metabolism and Excretion 
Following a single oral dose of ranolazine solution, approximately 75% of the dos e is excreted in urine 
and 25% in feces. Ranolazine is metabolized rapi[INVESTIGATOR_631510]; less than 
5% is excreted unchanged in urine and feces. The ph armacologic activity of the metabolites has not been 
well characterized. After dosing to steady-state wi th [ADDRESS_842801] AUC values ranging from  about 5 to 33% that of ranolazine, and display 
apparent half-lives ranging from 6 to 22 hours. Ranolazine is metabolized mainly by [CONTACT_097]3A and to a 
lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]2D6. 
 
2.3 Preclinical Data 
In rodents with experimental PAH7, 8 or chronic RV overload9, RVH, RV electrical remodeling, and RV 
dysfunction can be normalized with dichloroacetate (D CA), an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 
(PDK) which in turn activates pyruvate dehydroge nase (PDH) to favor oxid ative metabolism. These 
findings suggest that alterations in mitochondrial function, metabolism, and energy substrate utilization 
are keys to understanding the progression to RV failure.  Ranolazine, which is currently used for 
refractory myocardial ischemia12, 13, also activates PDH14-16 as well as inhibits fatty acid oxidation, sodium 
currents, and sodium-dependent calcium overload17. Recently, in a rodent model of RVH, ranolazine was 
reported to successfully reverse metabolic dysf unction and improve cardiac output and exercise 
capacity16.  
 
2.4 Clinical Data to Date 
Ranolazine has been evaluated in patients with chronic angina who remained symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_631511]. In the ERICA 36(Efficacy of Ranolazine In 
Chronic Angina) trial, 565 patients were randomized to receive an initial dose of ranolazine 500 mg b.i.d. 
or placebo for 1 week, followed by 6 weeks of treatm ent with ranolazine 1000 mg b.i.d. or placebo, in 
addition to concomitant treatment with amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10 mg q.d. In addition, 45% of the study population 
also received long acting nitrates. Sublingual nitrat es were used as needed to treat angina epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Statistically significant dec reases in angina attack frequency (p = 0.028) and nitroglycerin use (p = 0.014) 
were observed with ranolazine compared to place bo. These treatment effect s appeared consistent across 
age and use of long acting nitrates.  
CARISA37 was a study in 823 chronic angina patients rand omized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with 
twice-daily ranolazine 750 mg, 1000 mg, or placebo w ho also continued on daily doses of atenolol 50 mg, 
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5 mg, or diltiazem CD 180 mg. Sublingual ni trates were used in this study as needed. In this 
trial, statistically significant (p < 0.05) increases in  modified Bruce treadmill exercise duration and time to 
angina were observed for each ranolazine dose versus  placebo, at both trough (12 hours after dosing) 
and peak (4 hours after dosing) plasma levels, with minimal effects on blood pressure and heart rate. 
Exercise treadmill results showed no incr ease in effect on exercise at t he 1000 mg dose compared to the 
750 mg dose. 
There is no clinical data on the use of ranolazine in this study patient populati on. However, there is a 
clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ongoing.  The group of PAH subjects targeted in the cited trial must have 
angina or angina equivalent, and the trial primarily focuses on exercise capacity and hemodynamic 
assessment. The cited trial has a durat ion of 3 months with estimated enrollment is 25 subjects without a 
control group and is a single center open label study.

2.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
 
Subjects will receive ranolazine or placebo at 500mg PO BID and after two weeks will increase to 
1000mg PO BID and continue for a total of 26 weeks [ADDRESS_842802] common reported adverse 
reactions during treatment with ranolazine (>4% and more common than with placebo) were dizziness 
(6.2%), headache (5.5%), constipati on (4.5%), and nausea (4.4%).   Dizziness appeared to be dose 
related in clinical trials.  Subjects with persistent adverse reactions will be down titrated to 500mg BID. 
Subjects on moderate CYP3A inhibitors will be limited to 500mg BID.  For detailed safety information on ranolazine, refer to the most recent version from  the manufacture website ([COMPANY_009]).  The route of 
administration, dosage, and dosage regimen are per manufacturer label for chronic angina.  1000 mg 
twice a day is the maximum tolerated dose. The do sage period is longer than what has been tested for 
angina because we hypothesize that ranolazine’s effect on RV metabolism will result in improvement in 
RV function and therefore patient symptoms will take longer than angina symptom relief due to time 
required for RV remodeling.  The maximum tolerated dose is targeted in order to derive the maximum benefit if there is any benefit to t he patients. The risks of exposure as  related to adverse reactions is 
uncommon and are reasonable given that RV is a nove l therapeutic target and current PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631512].

6 Study Drug  
6.1 Description 
Ranolazine is a racemic mixture and chemical ly described as 1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_631509], N -(2,6-
dimethylphenyl)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)pr opyl]-, (±)-. It has an empi[INVESTIGATOR_299754] 
C24H33N3O4, a molecular weight of 427.54 g/mole. Ranexa is available for oral administration as film-
coated, extended-release tablets cont aining 500 mg of ranolazine.  
6.2 Treatment Regimen 
All subjects will receive ranolazine or placebo at 5 00mg PO BID and after two weeks will increase to 
1000mg PO BID.  Subjects will continue at 1000mg BID for the duration of the treatment period (26 
weeks).  Subjects with persistent adverse reacti ons will be down titrated to 500mg BID. Subjects on 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors will be limited to 500mg BID.  
6.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
This is a double blind study.  Subjects will be random ized in a 2:1 fashion to ranolazine or placebo by [CONTACT_631538] (IDS).   
 
Targeting RV in PAH  Page [ADDRESS_842810] will 
proceed through the use of a randomization table at Penn IDS. The Investigational Drug Service will 
prepare a randomization table using random blocks of 3, at a 2:1 ratio of active to placebo (this is a 
continuation of the study which randomized 14 subjects  that was sponsored by [CONTACT_631539]).  The table will 
be computer-generated prior to the st art of the trial and maintained securely within the Investigational 
Drug Service (IDS), which is not accessible to the re st of the study team.  Subjects will be assigned to 
treatment in sequential order (lowest to highest).   For emergency unmasking, the IDS will upload the 
randomization table into a secure web portal and issue an account for the study principal 
investigator.  The account will per mit access from any internet-en abled computer and will collect 
information on the reason for unmasking (such as whether there is a serious adverse event) before revealing the treatment assignment for one individual  subject.  All use of the emergency unmasking 
system is logged and reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_631540].  If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_631516], the IDS may 
contact [CONTACT_631541].
 
After a subject is screened and determined to be eligible for the study, the site personnel (the investigator 
or his/her designee) will contact [CONTACT_631542]  a randomization number. The randomization number 
and the date the randomization number is assigned w ill be recorded in the eCRF. Once randomization 
numbers and registration numbers have been assigned, they cannot be reassigned.  
When a subject discontinues treatment, the invest igator or his or her designee will enter date of 
discontinuation on the eCRF and the date when the last dos e of test article was received by [CONTACT_423].  
6.4 Preparation, Packaging and Administration of Study Drug 
Ranolazine and placebo will be shipped directly from G ilead to Penn’s Investigational Drug Service (IDS). 
IDS will be coordinating the random ization process. The IDS will pa ckage blinded study medications 
according to the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280156] P ennsylvania’s Pharmacy Policy and Procedures. Labeling 
will be done by [CONTACT_17387], and each packet will incl ude the subject’s registra tion number, name, date 
dispensed, storage conditions and directions for use.  Penn IDS will ship to research pharmacy or 
investigator at each institution once the subject is  enrolled and randomization procedure is performed.  
6.[ADDRESS_842811] be 
recorded for Drug Accountability and Reconciliation at each visit. Study drug bottles will be required to be 
returned at applicable visits throughout the study.  
6.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
Use of medications not exclud ed in the entry criteria will be permitted at the discretion of the investigator.  
Any medication, including over-the-counter medicati ons, used during the cour se of the study will be 
documented.    
Eligible subjects may be receiving one of the following treatment regimens at screening:  
 
 Monotherapy with an endothelin receptor antagoni st (ERA: e.g., ambrisentan, or bosentan), a 
phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE5i: e.g ., sildenafil, tadalafil),  a parenteral prostanoid 
(intravenous [iv] epoprostenol, iv or subcutaneous Treprostinil), or an inhaled prostanoid (inhaled 
iloprost or treprostinil) that is approved for the treatment of PAH   
 Patient might be on chronic therapy for PAH including but not limited to digoxin and/or  
amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050].   
 Combination therapy with eligible PAH treatment s (any combination of two or three of ERA, 
PDE5i, or prostanoid).  
 
 Other new PAH specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_631517] [ADDRESS_842812]'s treatment assignment may be done only for reasons related to subject safety. All 
efforts will be made to keep the investigator team blinded, such as having IDS send the unblinding information directly to the treating physician without in volving the Investigator. If the investigator is the 
treating physician, then they will be involved in the un blinding.  Unblinding reasons, date, and time will be 
documented in the subject research record. The DSMB may also request for unblinding to occur through concerns over subject safety. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_842813] be performed and a drug receipt 
log filled out and signed by [CONTACT_17247].  It is important that the designated study 
staff counts and verifies that the shipment contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any 
damaged or unusable study drug in a given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in 
the study files.  The investigator  must notify study sponsor of any damaged or unusable study treatments 
that were supplied to the investigator’s site. 
 
6.8.[ADDRESS_842814] be available for inspection.   
Before any procedures specified in this protocol are performed *, a subject must:

8.1.2 Analysis of CMR data 
From the cine images, RV and LV ventricular si ze, volumes, mass, and function are analyzed using 
Qmass (Medis) and then indexed to body surface area.   Phase contrast images will be processed using 
software tools.  
 
8.2 Metabolon/MicroRNA 
8.2.[ADDRESS_842823] a c linically indicated right heart catheterization during 
screening, plasma may be drawn during the procedure for microRNA analysis.   
8.2.2 Analysis of Metabolon data 
Analytical platform uses gas chromatography-mas s spectrometry method (Metabolon Inc) to provide 
increased overall coverage of small molecules and allows high-throughput data analysis to identify 
biomarkers of disease. Following peak identification and quality control filtering, integrated peak ion counts for each compound in each sample are used for statistical analysis. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_842824] oratory correlational analysis will be performed 
among the various imaging parameters and biomarkers  using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. 
!
8.[ADDRESS_842825]’s own 
perceptions about his or her qualit y of life.  The investigator must not influence the subject’s 
assessments.  Every effort should be made to maintain an unbiased assessment. Refer to the flowchart 
for time points. We will be using the SF-36 tool, which is a short-form health survey with 36 questions. 
The endpoint is the 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores. 
 
8.4 Laboratory Determinations 
Refer to the Flowchart for specifics and time points. 
 Local laboratories will be used to process blood specimens for complete blood cell counts, 
coagulation tests, chemistry, and urinalysis. 
 The complete blood cell count includes white blood ce ll count (WBC) with differential, platelet count, 
red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (Hgb), and hematocrit (Hct). 
 The chemistry panel includes levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, BUN (or urea), creatinine, 
glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, AST, ALT,  albumin, total protein, uric acid, CRP, ANA, 
NT-proBNP. 
 Coagulation tests include prothrombin time (PT,  which may be expressed as INR), and partial 
thromboplastin time (PTT). 
 Pregnancy tests (serum or urine) must be done before CMR in women of child bearing potential.   
 
Blood samples may be taken and used for purposes related to this research.  The samples will be stored 
for up to [ADDRESS_842826].

9 Statistical Plan 9.1 Sample Size Determination 
Approximately 10 subjects with PAH and RV dysfuncti on will be randomized in 2:[ADDRESS_842827]  18 evaluable subjects with 12 evaluable subjects 
for ranolazine and 6 for placebo, after accounting for 20 percent dropout/noneval uable. Additionally, there 
are [ADDRESS_842828] drug treatment. With 12 treated patients and 12 untreated patients (6 in the randomized group and 6 in the observational group), as suming the effect size is 40% with a standard 
deviation of 50%, we will have 87.0%  power to detect the difference bet ween groups with a sample size 
of 12. If the effect size is lower at 35% with a st andard deviation of 50%, we will have 78.2% power to 
detect the difference between groups with a sample size of 12. The unequal randomization is to ensure 
minimum number of subjects are exposed to the treatm ent to provide sufficient information for the study. 
Additionally, we have control patients in the obse rvational group from a prior study who also have 
longitudinal 6 months data.   
 
9.2 Statistical Methods 
9.2.1 General Considerations 
Continuous data  (e.g., age) will be summarized using the fo llowing descriptive su mmary statistics: the 
number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimu m value (min), and maximum value (max). For each 
continuous variable, the corresponding mean, m edian, minimum and maximum will be presented to [ADDRESS_842829] and the SD to 2 decimal places, unless otherwise specified.  
Categorical variables  (e.g., presence of an AE) will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
Percentages will be presented to [ADDRESS_842830] recent non-missin g measurement collected prior to the initial 
administration of study drug (screening or  Day 1), unless otherwise specified.  
Unscheduled Visits : Subject data obtained during unscheduled visits will not be summarized but 
included in subject data listings only. Unscheduled visit values will not be used to impute missing 
scheduled visit values. 
Incomplete/Missing data : Missing data (e.g., dates, post-base line values) will not be imputed, unless 
otherwise specified; i.e., all missing values and miss ing post-baseline values will remain as missing in all 
statistical analyses and listings, unless otherwise specified. 
Outliers:  No formal statistical analyses will be performed to detect and/or remedy the presence of 
statistical outliers. 
Additionally, all subject data, includi ng derived variables, will be presented in subject data listings; listings 
will display all subjects who were ran domized or enrolled in the study.   
Targeting RV in PAH  Page 23 
Version1  
 
9.2.2 Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Disposition 
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (all randomized population, all 
treated population, completed the treatment, comple ted the study, and discontinued early from treatment 
or study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized based on all 
randomized population. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics (age, sex,  race, ethnicity, weight, height and body mass index 
[BMI]) will be summarized. Summary will be based on the all randomized population.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced 
(WHODDE), March 2012 version. Medications used in the study will be summarized in 2 parts:  
 Prior medication:  medication taken before the initial dosin g of study drug in the current study, 
regardless of when the medication administration ended. 
 Concomitant medication:  medication received at or after init ial dosing of study drug, or those 
received before initial dosing with study drug that  continued after initial dosing of study drug.  
If a medication start date is at or after the date of dosing of study drug, then the medication will be 
summarized as concomitant medication regardless of whether the medication end date is missing or not. 
If a medication end date is before the date of dosi ng of study drug, then the medication will be 
summarized as a prior medication regardless of w hether the medication start date is missing or not. Note 
that medication taken before initial dosing of st udy drug and continued after initial dosing will be 
summarized as prior medication, and separately as concomitant medication. 
Concomitant medications will be assigned to each  dosing period based on the start date of the 
medication and the study drug administration dates (concomitant medications taken during the first 
dosing period will be assigned to the first dosing period , and so forth). Note that a concomitant medication 
may be assigned to both dosing periods.  
Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_631543], based on the FAS. Prior 
medications will only be listed. Summary will be based on the all randomized population.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Exposure  
Exposure (days) of study drug administration will be estimated as last dose date – first dose date + 1, 
where dose refers to a dose of study drug. 
Exposure to each study drug will be summariz ed based on the all-treated population.  
Study drug exposure will also be presented in an indi vidual subject data listing to indicate the date and 
time of dosing and whether the study drug was taken completely or not.  
9.2.3  Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
 
Cardiac MRI to assess RV function will be used as primary endpoint for assessment the treatment 
outcome.  All variables from CMR imaging will be summariz ed and listed. Treatment effect will be tested 
using Analysis of covariance (ANOVA), with treatmen t in the model. If the normality assumption fails, non-
parametric method will be employed. Difference betw een drug vs. placebo pre and post treatment will be 
summarized and tested using t-test. Significance will be established at alpha level of 0.05. The efficacy 
analysis will be conducted on the all-treated population. 
Targeting RV in PAH  Page 24 
Version1  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Exploratory Clinical Variables 
The exploratory efficacy endpoint is the estimate and a confidence interval for the difference in 
proportions between the treatment groups. Number and percentage of subjects with high risk profile for 
each treatment group at Week 26 will be provided.  Fisher’s Exact test will be employed to detect the 
difference between Placebo vs Active. Patients with high risk profile are defined as patients with clinical 
worsening events or lack of clinical improvement at the end of the study (week 26).  The primary efficacy 
analysis will be conducted on the all-randomized population.  
 
 Clinical worsening event (per independent clinical  assessment), as defined by [CONTACT_631544] n till end of treatment visit, week 26. 
 Lack of clinical improvement. Clinical improvement  is defined as an increase in 6MWD >or= 15% 
or more from baseline AND an improvement (decrease)  in functional class by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_842831] clinician will be involved to adjudicate the ca se. The evaluation from the adjudicator will 
be used for analysis. At any given time the differenc e exceed more than 30%, the investigator will have a 
conversation with the 2 independent clinicians to narrow the difference.   
For subjects do not experience clinical worsening, the end of the treatment visit (week 26) with 6MWT 
and functional class assessment would determine if there is  no clinical improvement or if there is clinical 
improvement. All efforts should be made to collect the death information in the follow up period. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Other Exploratory Endpoints 
A. Quality of Life Health Outcome 
The objective is to assess the improvement in qualit y of life of the subjects after being treated with 
ranolazine. Ordinal regression will be employed using SF-[ADDRESS_842832] a general health 
perception variable (response optio ns ‘Excellent’, 'Very good', 'Good',  'Fair', and 'Poor'). Items that 
significantly predicted this variabl e were candidates for inclusion in the utility exercise. The efficacy 
analysis will be conducted on the all-randomized population. 
  
      B. Additional exploratory endpoints including additional MRI imaging, metabolic data, microRNA, will be summarized and tested using t-test (paired for pre and post data on the same patient, unpaired for 
Arm 1 and Arm 2 patients). If the normality assumpti on fails, non-parametric method will be employed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
AEs will be coded according to MedDRA (Version 15.1) and will be classified as pre-treatment or 
treatment-emergent.   AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0.  
 Pre-treatment adverse events are defined as AEs that developed or worsened after signing the 
informed consent before the start of study drug. 
 Treatment-emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with start date or increased 
severity on or after the first study drug dose through the Safety Follow-up Visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory 
All statistical analyses of laboratory values will be  performed using international system (SI) units. 
Continuous hematology/coagulation and clinical chemistry results will be summarized (raw and change from baseline) at each scheduled time point. The number and percentage of subjects with shift changes 
from baseline based on the laboratory normal ranges will be tabulated at each scheduled time point.  
Targeting RV in PAH  Page 25

[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram 
A summary of raw values and change from baseline values will be provided by [CONTACT_631545]: heart rate, PR, RR, QRS, QT and QTc 
intervals (QTcB and QTcF). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
The following vital signs (raw va lues and change from baseline) w ill be summarized by [CONTACT_631546]: systolic and diastolic blo od pressure (mmHg), body temperature, pulse rate 
(beats per minute [bpm], oxygen saturation).  
9.[ADDRESS_842833] Population(s) for Analysis 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using all-rand omized population.  All safety (AE, lab, vital) 
analyses will be performed using all-treated population. Subject populations are specified within each of 
the analyses section.  
10 Safety and Adverse Events 
10.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involvi ng Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study-related documents such 
as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc) 
 Related or possibly rela ted to participation in the research (i .e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experie nce, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm). 
 Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that deve lops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are cons idered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_631547] (see below), the term “condition” may include abnormal physical exam ination findings, symptoms, or diseases. 
 Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical history (e.g. 
seasonal allergy without acute complaints). 
 Conditions that started before signing of info rmed consent and for which symptoms or treatment 
are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical 
history. 
 Conditions that pertain to primary or secondary efficacy variables of this study, i.e. findings in 
CMR and PET and which are considered pre-existing medical conditions, are not considered AEs 
unless there is worsening. This also implies that the indication for the imaging procedure and the 
confirmation of a diagnosis w ill not be considered as an AE. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
Targeting RV in PAH  Page 26 
Version1  
 
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or sign ificant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
 Important medical events are those that may not be imm ediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the s ubject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, dr ug overdose or abuse, a seiz ure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .

The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from 
the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatm ent follow-up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow-up is defined as [ADDRESS_842834] administration of study drug.   
 Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity,  or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality shoul d be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant find ings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to repo rt any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse ev ent occurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participa tion that may reasonably be related to this study.  
The sponsor should also be notified if the invest igator should become aware of the development of 
cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently co nceived offspring of a subject that has participated 
in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be document ed as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refu ted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality 
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality is of a degree that require s active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137135] a serious adverse event unless specifica lly instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any 
Targeting RV in PAH  Page 27 
Version1  
 
condition responsible for surgery should be documen ted as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hosp italization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631520]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631521], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_28690]. 
10.[ADDRESS_842835] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event m odule of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms , and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  T he clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or unt il it has been determined t hat the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events  that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to  the study treatment or study participation should 
be recorded and reported immediately. 
10.[ADDRESS_842836] be reported are 
those that are: 
 related to study participation, 
 unexpected, and  
 serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).    
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum nec essary information to be provided at the time of 
the initial report includes: 
 Study identifier 
 Subject number 
 A description of the event 
 Date of onset  Current status 
 Whether study was discontinued 
 The reason why the event is classified as serious 
 Investigator assessme nt of the association 
between the event and study drug  
 
Any study-related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to subjects or  others, and any type of 
serious adverse event, must be reported to Penn princi ple investigator. To report such events, a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) form must be completed by t he investigator and faxed or emailed to the study 
sponsor within [ADDRESS_842837] the 
understanding of the event.  Significant new inform ation on ongoing serious adverse events should be 
provided promptly to the Penn principle investigator.

Reporting Procedures for Potential Endpoints and Endpoints 
Events that are potential endpoints: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631522], death, worsening of PAH, lung or heart-lung 
transplant, atrial septostomy or other interventional procedure specifically for RH failure or PAH, decline 
of 6-MWD, increase in Borg Dyspnea Index and Incr ease in WHO-functional class initially will not be 
considered as serious adverse events but will be handl ed as efficacy endpoints.  They will not be subject 
to the immediate submission require ments for SAEs in this study and w ill not require the investigator’s 
causality assessment.  The site inve stigator will make the initial determ ination to classify these events as 
endpoints or SAEs.  Events that  are equivocal will be adjudicated by t he medical monitor in real time.  For 
these potential endpoints, an SAE eCRF will only be comp leted if the DSMB deter mines that a specific 
event does not meet the criteria for the relevant  endpoint (ie, the potential endpoint is negatively 
adjudicated).  Once an investigator is notified of th e negative adjudication, the investigator must complete 
and submit a SAE eCRF within 24 hours.  The DSMB will be requested to follow the occurrence of these 
events to see if specific action needs to be taken during the course of the study.   
 In addition, the DSMB will review all fatal endpoints to evaluate whether the caus e of death is due to a 
serious adverse event that is a specific concer n for the study drug or which may be individually 
informative, such as an anaphylactic reaction, rha bdomyolysis, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  If such an 
event is detected, the DSMB will notify the inve stigator to submit the SAE per local reporting 
requirements.   
10.3.1 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB 
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_145181], 
affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety repo rting to the Penn IRB. The 
University of Pennsylvania IRB (P enn IRB) requires expedited reporting of those events related to study 
participation that are unforeseen and indicate that part icipants or others are at increased risk of harm.  
The Penn IRB will not acknowledge safety reports or  bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet 
the criteria outlined below.  The Penn IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following 
problems within 10 working days from the time the investigator becomes aware of the event: 
 Any adverse event (regardless of whether the event is serious or non-serious, on-site or off-site) 
that occurs any time during or after the resear ch study, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_214167]: 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpect ed” when its specificity and severity are not accurately reflected 
in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol, any applicable 
investigator brochure, and the current IRB-approved informed consent document and other 
relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts.) 
AND 
Related to the research procedures (An event is “related to the research procedures” if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_28692], t he event was more likely than not to be caused by 
[CONTACT_28821].) 
 Reporting Process 
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the Penn 
IRB using the form: “Unanticipated Problems Posing Risks to Subjects or Others Including Reportable 
Adverse Events” or as a written repo rt of the event (including a descri ption of the event with information 
regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow- up/resolution and need for revision to consent form 
and/or other study documentation). 
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_631523]’s study file. 
 
Other Reportable events: 
For clinical drug trials, the following even ts are also reportable to the Penn IRB: 
Targeting RV in PAH  Page 29 
Version1  
 
 Any adverse experience that, even without det ailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected 
adverse event that is rare in  the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic 
necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to  modify the investigator s brochure, protocol or 
informed consent form, or would prompt other acti on by [CONTACT_65804]. 
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or  potential benefits of t he research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected. 
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular si de effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected. 
– A paper is published from another study that show s that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value. 
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from  marketing of a drug, device, or biologic used in 
a research protocol. 
 Breach of confidentiality 
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB re view to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant. 
 Incarceration of a participant when the res earch was not previously  approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best in terest of the subject to remain on the study. 
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot 
be resolved by [CONTACT_5051]. 
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he investigator placed one or more participants at increased risk, or 
affects the rights or welfare of subjects. 
10.3.2 Investigator reporting: Notifying a non-Penn IRB 
Investigators who are not Penn faculty or affiliated with  a Penn research site are responsible for safety 
reporting to their local IRB.  Investigators are resp onsible for complying with their local IRB’s reporting 
requirements, though must submit the required reports to their IRB no later than 10 working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_631524]’s study 
file. 
 
10.4 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_631525]/her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include care ful assessment and appropr iate reporting of adv erse events as noted 
above.  Medical monitoring will include a regular a ssessment of the number and type of serious adverse 
events.  Safety will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_631548]. A Data and Safety Monito ring Committee (DSMB) is planned to monitor the 
safety of this study.   
10.[ADDRESS_842838] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
11.1 Confidentiality 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Ac t of 1996 (HIPAA).  Thos e regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informin g the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prio r to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect  or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that t he subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period. 
11.2 Source Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of cl inical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and eval uation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original docu ments, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memora nda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from aut omated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_631526], microfiches, photogr aphic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and record s kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico-technical departments involved in the clinical trial. 
11.3 Data Management Plan 
We will create a shared database with common data  definitions.  This dat abase will be programmed in 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).  REDC ap is a secure, web-based application with the 
capacity for direct export to Ex cel and common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Strata, R).  REDCap 
has electronic CRFs, real-time data entry validation,  audit trails, user authentication, data logging and 
encryption.  It is HIPAA compliant with mechani sms in place to ensure confidentiality. 
 
Specific forms will be used for each component of the subject’s progress.  The forms and data dictionary 
will be available online for all individuals who perf orm data entry.  Research personnel, trained on data 
definitions, will enter data via web-based data forms afte r abstraction from the primary medical record and 
source documents.  The multisit e feature of REDCap will be used to restrict data viewing by 
[CONTACT_431].   In addition, logical data checks will be used to assess data quality for miss-entry.  Suspect 
data entries will be flagged for re-review and confirmati on by [CONTACT_631549].  When 
data are complete and all suspect entries addressed fo r a time period, the database will be “locked” for 
analysis.  Analysis will use onl y this final locked version.

human participants.   
11.5 Records Retention 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_842840] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the investigational produc t.  These documents should be retained for a longer 
period if required by [CONTACT_315192] s ponsor.  In such an instance, it  is the responsibility of the 
sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
11.6 Management of Information for Multi-Center Research 
University of Pennsylvania will be the coordinating ce nter as well as a site for recruitment and data 
collection for the trial.  Brigham and Women’s Hospit al and the University of Maryland will be the other 
sites.  [CONTACT_141248] (Penn) and [CONTACT_631554] (BWH), the PIs of the grant together with the Project Manager at 
Penn will supervise all aspects of the project, includi ng management of project timelines, management of 
data collected from each site, safety reporting, and submitting progress reports.  There will be regular, 
documented communication (e.g. teleconferences) with the participating sites to update and inform all 
participating sites about progress of t he study.   As the lead investigator at the coordinating institution, [CONTACT_631555] will receive data and reports from other sites in a timely manner and distribute them to the Penn IRB 
and other sites as required.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_631527], managing IRB communications  and data quality.  The DSMB will also monitor 
participant safety and evaluate t he progress of the study.   
 
[ADDRESS_842841] is enrolled at each site, and throughout the trial:    
 
1) Informed consent documentation w ill be reviewed for all subjects 
2) Eligibility criteria 
3) Safety Monitoring (adverse event documentation and assessment) 
4) Regulatory documentation (IRB – amendm ents, continuing review  and reportable events) 
 
12.2 Regulatory Documents Reviewed 
The Regulatory Documents will be maintained in the Regulatory Binder.  The Regulatory Binder may be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_631550].  The monito r will review the regulatory binder for completeness 
and will assure that the CRFs are being completed.      
12.3  Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study-related monitori ng, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related 
documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory document s, data collection instrume nts, study data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for insp ections of applicable study-related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
Participation as an investigator in this study imp lies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
[ADDRESS_842842] icable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicabl e institutional research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitt ed to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review  Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal 
Targeting RV in PAH  Page [ADDRESS_842843].  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the investigator  and a copy of this decision w ill be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  The investigator shoul d provide a list of EC/IRB members and their affiliate 
to the sponsor.  
All subjects for this study will be provided a consen t form describing this study and providing sufficient 
information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent 
form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB for the study.  The formal 
consent of a subject, using the EC/IRB-approved c onsent form, must be obtained before that subject 
undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by t he subject or legally acceptable 
surrogate, and the investigator-designated re search professional obtaining the consent.

CAMPUS BOX F -490    TELEPHONE:  303 -724-1055  Fax:  [ADDRESS_703212] Title:  Evaluation of Thyroid Stunning from a Diagnostic Dose of I -123 
Principal Investigator:   [INVESTIGATOR_539551], MD  
Version:  8.0 v. 7/26/ 2018  
 
I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :  
Specific Aim : In a test -retest protocol , determine whether I -123 causes stunning.  
Hypothesis : Pretreatment dosimetry with I -[ADDRESS_703213], before doing routine I -131 remnant ablation . 
 
II. Background and Significance : The annual incidence of  differentiated thyroid cancer  in the 
[LOCATION_002]  is approximately 44,000 cases and the annual death rate is approximately 1,700 
individuals (1). Although many patients do well with conventional therapy of surgery and remnant 
thyroid tissue ablation  with  I-131, a significant minority of patients develop regional and/or 
distant metastases. Initially, these metastases are diff erentiated and take up iodine and t he 
standard of care is I -[ADDRESS_703214] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_539552] d ifferentiated thyroid metastases with a 
fixed dose of 100 to 200 mCi of 1 -131 while a few university centers use individualized dosimetry 
to determine the maximum safe tolerable dose. The dosimetric approach is based on the 
assumption that a larger dose is  more likely to ablate residual functioning thyroid cancer than a 
smaller dose. Although the dosimetric approach was described more than 45 years ago by [CONTACT_539556] 
(2), there is still no consensus with respect to the advantage of the dosimetric approach over th e 
fixed dose (3 -9). 
 In the case of treatment with a fixed dose , the patient is usually treated with a 
therapeutic dose of I -131 without performing a preliminary biodistribution study. However, in the 
case of treatment with the maximum safe dose of I -131 b ased on dosimetry, it is necessary to give 
an initial small dose of radioiodine, usually I -131, to measure the biodistribution of radioiodine 
and in turn to calculate the maximum dose that the patient can safely tolerate. The dilemma is 
that there is signi ficant, but controversial, evidence that the initial small dose of I -131 may stun 
the thyroid metastases and decrease the uptake of the subsequent therapeutic dose of I -131, 
thus defeating the purpose of dosimetrically determining the maximum safe dose (4, 10-20). 
 The radioisotope of iodine, I -123, is a pure gamma emitter and is thought to be less likely 
to cause stunning than I -131. However, there are some reports that even I -123 can cause stunning 
(21-24). 
 If it is demonstrated that I -[ADDRESS_703215] that the dosimetric approach, which is currently used in only a 
Protocol  8.0 v. 3.1.18  Page 2 
 small minority of patients, should be offered to all patients. This would represent a major advance 
in the treatment of patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. Alte rnatively, if a 
dosimetrically determined dose of I -131 is not superior to a fixed dose,  all patients can be treated 
with the simpler less costly fixed dose regimen.   
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:  N/A 
 
IV. Research  Methods  
 
A. Outcome Measure(s) :  Difference in uptake of I -123 in the thyroid remnant in the neck in 
the two imaging studies. Greater than a 20% decrease from the first to second study will 
indicate evidence of stunning.  
 
B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:    
 
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Patient must be [ADDRESS_703216] qualify for thyroid ablation with I -131.  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.  
2. Prior bovine TSH use.  
3. Known metastatic thyroid cancer.  
4. History of cardiovascular disease that may adversely affect patient 
participation at the discr etion of the primary investigator.  
5. Patients on hemodialysis.  
6. Patients  with acute serious illnesses at the discretion of the primary 
investigator.  
 
C. Study Design and Research Methods:  The proposed research will be the first study to 
perform test -retest studi es in a group of patients to answer the long standing and 
fundamental question of whether diagnostic doses of I -[ADDRESS_703217] of care and research interventions for the study population.

 Patient Preparation  
 
 Participants will be placed on a low iodine diet for 1 week before the dosimetry study 
and continue on this diet until 24 hours  after the therapeutic dose of 131I.   
Patient  is prepared for the study by [CONTACT_539557] 
(Thyrogen) . The patients are prepared for receiving radioiodine by [CONTACT_539558] (Thyrogen) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 in order to raise the blood level of 
TSH and maximally stimulate the residual thyroid tissue to take up iodine (25 -27). The 
Thyrogen received on days 1, 2, [ADDRESS_703218]’s vital signs will be monitored before and after each Thyrogen injection.  The 
Thyrogen injection will be withheld if vital signs show significant alterations from the patient’s 
baseline.  
Female patient s of reproductive age who have not undergone a hysterectomy will 
undergo  serum pregnancy tests on days [ADDRESS_703219] blood samples taken on days 3, 10, and 17 in the morning, to 
document that rhTSH wa s given and that there was a rise in thyroglobulin level (TSH action on 
thyroid cells) prior to administration of radioiodine.  
 
Diagnostic imaging with I -[ADDRESS_703220] will be placed over the I -123 
uptake in the residual thyroid tissue and the number of counts will be recorded (28). Less 
than a 20% decrease in cou nts from the first to the second study will be considered no 
significant stunning (29). The Null hypothesis is that there will be less than a 20% decrease in 
I-[ADDRESS_703221] and 
second study, percent uptake of I -123 in the residual thyroid tissue can be calcu lated for each 
study and compared. Less than a 20% decrease in percent uptake of I -[ADDRESS_703222] and nuclear medicine physician (range 30 -100 mCi 131I).  
Protocol  8.[ADDRESS_703223] -treatment imaging evaluation  
 
Approximately 7 to 10 days after therapeutic dose of radioiodine (day 23 -26), patient 
returns for routine, s tandard of care post 1131I treatment imaging.  
 
 
D. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools: A risk of 
participating in this research study is the relatively small additional radiation dose from 
second dosimetric study prec eding the standard I -131 therapeutic ablation. Assuming a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  30-100 mCi I -131 ablation dose, the one additional I -123 diagnostic study will 
increase the effective whole body dose by [CONTACT_3450] 0.5% -1.6% . The small increase in 
radiation to the remna nt thyroid tissue should be of no consequence since it will be 
ablated by [CONTACT_539559] I -131 one week  later.  
 
Another possible risk is that the radiation to the thyroid remnant from the initial 
experimental dosimetry studies will stun the  remnant to the extent that it may not be 
effectively  ablated. This is highly  unlikely since the commonly used 30-100 mCi dose of I -
131 is chosen for a significant margin of error so that very few remnants are not 
successfully ablated.  
 
Patient Safety Moni toring Plan:  Subject will remain in the clinical area for [ADDRESS_703224] symptoms are headache observed in 
5% and nausea observed in 5% of patients. I -[ADDRESS_703225] -treatment imaging study.  
 
The study Principle investigator, co -investigators and study coordinator will meet monthly 
to review preliminary data and discuss any safety related issues that may arise. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_539553].  
 
E. Potential Scientific Problems:  None.  
 
F. Data Analysis Plan: The primary endpoint will be measurement of thyroid remnant 
activity at [ADDRESS_703226] there will be less than a 20% reduction i n the amount of I -
[ADDRESS_703227] and, if there is stunning, whether there is more than a 20% stunning effect by 
[CONTACT_941] t -test. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but it is likely to give results that are sufficiently definitive 
that it will not need to be repeated with larger numbers of participants. In addition, this is 
an internally funded research project that is intended to generate preliminary data to be 
Protocol  8.0 v. 3.1.18  Page 6 
 used in a large r NIH grant proposal that will compare fixed versus dosimetrically 
determined I -131 doses for treatment of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer with 
distant metastases.  
 
G. Monitoring and Oversight  
The sponsor investigator will be responsible for monit oring the trial per the trial 
monitoring plan, in addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial including any 
specimens collected, executing the data and safety monitoring (DSM) plan, and complying 
with all reporting requirements to local and  federal authorities. This oversight will be 
accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center).   The 
DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality a nd study participant safety for all clinical 
studies at the CU Cancer Center, which is the coordinating institution of this trial.    A 
summary of the DSMC’s activities is as follows:  
 
• Conduct of internal audits  
• Ongoing review of all serious adverse eve nts (SAEs), unanticipated problems (UAPs) and 
reportable adverse events (AEs)  
• Has the authority to close and/or suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues  
• May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s 
Executive Comm ittee  
 
Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are 
reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor investigator per protocol.   All SAEs, UAPs and 
reportable AEs are to be reported to the DSMC within [ADDRESS_703228]’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_539554].   Data regarding number of subjects, significant toxicities, 
dose modifi cations, and treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the 
meeting’s minutes.  
 
The sponsor investigator will provide a DSM report to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a 
six month basis. The DSM report will include a protocol summary; current enrol lment 
numbers; summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs; any dose 
modifications; all protocol deviations; and protocol amendments. The DSM report 
submitted to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy dat a 
analysis conducted.   Results and recommendations from the review of this six month 
report by [CONTACT_341037] a DSMC review 
letter.   The sponsor investigator is then responsible for ensuring this letter is sub mitted to 
the site’s IRB of record at the time of IRB continuing review.  
 
Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
 
Site monitoring visits will be performed by [CONTACT_16170]’s authorized 
representative on a regular basis, pursuant to the Monitoring  Plan. During these visits, 
information recorded on the CRFs will be verified against source documents.   Additional 
Protocol  8.0 v. 3.1.18  Page 7 
 computer programs that identify selected protocol deviations, out -of-range data, and 
other data errors within the electronic data entry may also be used to help monitor the 
study.   As necessary, requests for data clarification or correction will be sent to the 
appropriate site PI.  
 
Independent auditors from the sponsor investigator’s authorized representative will be 
allowed by [CONTACT_779]’s PI t o audit.   In addition, audits may be conducted at any time by 
[CONTACT_16171]/or the IRB.  
 
 
H. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained: There will be no benefits to the human subjects in 
this research project. However, there is likely to be si gnificant benefit to future patients 
with differentiated thyroid cancer.  
 
If it is demonstrated that I -[ADDRESS_703229] that the dosimetric 
approach which is currently used in only a small minority of patients should be offered to 
all patient s. This would represent a major advance in the treatment of patients with 
metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. Alternatively, if a dosimetrically determined 
dose of I -131 is not superior to a fixed dose, all patients can be treated with the simpler 
less costly fixed dose regimen.

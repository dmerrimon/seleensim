The hormone c ortisol is a key  regulator of metabolism  that influences the use of glucose 
(sugar) and fat as fuels. Persistently increased  cortisol levels , as in Cushing’s syndrome , lead to 
obesity,  type 2 diabetes mellitus and lipid abnormalities including elevated triglyceride levels and 
low high -density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.  These same disorders are also present in patients 
without Cushing’s syndrome, suggesting that cortisol may be involved in their pathogenesis. 
Mifepristone is a cortisol -like drug that blocks cortisol action in the body.  It can reverse lipid 
abnormalities, diabetes and obesity in Cushing’s syndrome patients but its effects on these 
conditions have not been tested in patien ts without the syndrome.  
The long -term aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the ability of mifepristone  to reverse or 
improve glucose intolerance, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension and weight gain . An initial 7-day 
          IRB submission CR 11-16-[ADDRESS_1100453] six and no more 
than eight weeks .  The tests will include blood drawing, urine collection, administration of glucose 
and insulin by [CONTACT_59570], and a cortisol -like material to evaluate the metabolism of cortisol  and a related 
hormone, corticosterone.

4 BACKGROUND  
 
Cortisol is an  important regulator of metabolism that modulates the use of glucose and fat 
as fuels. Elevated cortisol levels in Cushing’s syndrome lead to obesity, hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_797883] (TG) levels and low high -density lipoprotein  (HDL) levels,  and type 2 
diabetes  mellitus (1 ). These disorders also are common in the general population, in the absence 
of Cushing’s syndrome.  In people without Cushing’s syndrome, the constellation of abnormalities 
is often referred to as t he “Metabolic Syndrom e” based on the extent of the abnormalities. Some  
individuals with Metabolic Syndrome  seem to have mild  functional hypercortisolism, which may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of the syndrome ( 2 - 5).  Also , some individuals with abdominal  
obesity have increased urinary free cortisol (UF C) levels, loss of diurnal cortisol rhythm, and 
abnormal HPA axis suppression after dexamethasone ( 5 - 6), similar to the biochemical 
abnormalities seen in Cushing’s syndrome . Excess glucocorticoids in Cushing’s syndrome are 
known to favor visceral fat dep osition ( 7).  However, many individuals with obesity do not have 
abnormal cortisol tests ( 8).  Taken together, these data have led to the hypothesis that cortisol 
may be involved in development of abdominal obesity , glucose intolerance and other components  
of the Metabolic Syndrome, either because of subtle increases in circulating levels, or because of 
increased tissue exposure due to local metabolism .  
   
   
Associations between tissue levels of cortisol, obesity and glucose tolerance  
 
Circulating cortisol levels are mostly normal in people with central obesity, insulin resistance 
Metabolic Syndrome (2 - 3), leading to speculation that increased l ocal tissue exposure to  cortisol 
or its active metabolites may be critical in development of  these disorders.  One possibility is that 
there is increased local regeneration of cortisol from corticosterone.   The 11β -hydroxysteroid 
dehydrogenase (11 BHSD) enzymes interconvert hormonally inactive glucocorticoids such as 
cortisone and dehydrocorticost erone and their active forms, cortisol and corticosterone. The renal 
11BHSD2 enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cortisol to (inactive) cortisone, thus reducing 
mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol.  T he 11 BHSD 1 enzyme is more widely expressed (in liver, 
adipose, bone, and the central nervous system ) and functions primarily as a reductase (converting 
cortisone to cortisol) ( 9 - 10). Th is 11BHSD1 reductase activity requires  subcellular NADPH cofactor 
generation by [CONTACT_797896] -6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and in its absence , this bi -directional enzyme 
can convert cortisol to cortisone.   Intracellular cortisol levels may thus be modulated by 
[CONTACT_797897] 11 BHSD1, and this may contribute to the development of 
glucose intolerance and the M etabolic Syndrome ( 11).  
 Because urinary levels of cortisol, cortisone, and their metabolites reflect integrated (total) 
body metabolism (including the kidney), they cannot be used to assess the contribution of specific 
tissue compone nts.  As a result , 11BHSD effects have been assessed using enzymatic assays of 
activity, measurement of mRNA expression in specific tissues, or measurement of conversion of 
cortisol or cortisone labeled with stable isotopes . 
11BHSD1 expression and activity  has been found to be elevated in both visceral and 
subcutaneous fat depots in obese individuals ( 12 - 13). Purnell and colleagues studied eight obese 
men before and after weight loss and looked at daily cortisol production and clearance rates, 
intraabdomi nal fat (IAF) and subcutaneous fat (SQF) by [CONTACT_14781], insulin 
          IRB submission CR 11-16-17 
5 sensitivity (S I) by [CONTACT_797898], and subcutaneous 
adipocyte 11 BHSD1 gene expression by [CONTACT_4503] -PCR.  They found that increased c ortisol 
production rates and free cortisol levels correlated with increased IAF and decreased insulin 
sensitivity but not with subcutaneous fat. Increased 11 BHSD1 expression correlated with both IAF 
and SQF and with decreased S I.  With greater loss in body  fat than lean mass with weight loss, 
11BHSD1 expression was found to be decreased from baseline ( 13). These data support a role for 
increased  local (tissue) cortisol exposure leading to visceral fat deposition and insulin resistance.  
Many investigators  have suggested that increased cortisol release from the omentum into 
the portal vein contributes to hepatic insulin resistance associated with central obesity.  However 
in vivo  studies of obese non -diabetic individuals using stable isotopes suggest  that spl anchnic 
cortisol is derived entirely from the liver and that there is no cortisol release from the visceral 
tissue into the portal vein ( –14 - 15). On the contrary, visceral tissue releases cortisone into the 
portal venous system, thus potentially providin g increased substrate for hepatic conversion to 
cortisol ( 9). This cortisone release from the visceral tissue occurs in the presence of low levels of 
11BHSD2 mRNA in visceral fat. Therefore the exact mechanism by [CONTACT_797899]. It is possible that in some situations 11BHSD1 has a predominately dehydrogenase 
(inactivating) activity leading to cortisone production ( 16 - 17).  
It should be mentioned that some studies do not show a depot difference in 11BHSD1 
mRNA expression and have  suggested that under steady state conditions, increased local 
production of cortisol is unlikely to contribute to omental adipose tissue function ( 18). These 
discrepancies  in study results are likely related to differences in assays for measuring 11BHSD 
activity, the use of different cells or explants and the effects of renal 11BHSD2. Also, in vitro 
studies may not faithfully reproduce the in vivo  environment, and therefore may result in a false 
preponderance of reductase or dehydrogenase activity.   
 Although glucocorticoids have been shown to induce 11BSHD1 expression in vitro , a single 
study looking at omental levels of 11BHSD1 in Cushing’s syndrome patients found its expression to 
be similar to those of lean individuals ( 19).  However, as omental fat mass is generally increased in 
patients with Cushing’s syndrome, the net hormonal conversion cannot be ascertained.  
Moreover, it is possible that high cortisol levels overwhelm the 11BHSD1 enzyme, as seen with 
11BHSD2 enzyme in the kidneys ( 20), so that excess cortisol is delivered to the liver.  
 Genetically engineered mouse models  provide additional evidence for a potential pathologic 
role for 11BHSD.   Mice that over -express 11BHSD1 in the liver develop fatty liver, hypertensio n, 
and mild insulin resistance without altered fat depot mass  (21). On the other hand, transgenic 
mice overexpressing 11BHSD1 selectively in adipose tissue exhibit a full metabolic syndrome with 
visceral obesity, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], insulin resistance/diabetes  and hypertension (22). 
 Other types of local cortisol metabolism  may contribute to excess tissue glucocorticoid 
exposure.  Reduction of glucocorticoids to A -ring reduced dihydro - and tetrahydro -derivatives by 
[CONTACT_797900] [ADDRESS_1100454] shown that corticosterone, 5 α - tetrahydrocorticosterone 
(5αTHB), and 5 α –dihydrocorticosterone (5αDHB) are similarly effective in displacing tritiated 
dexamethasone from binding sites in hepatocytes while the 5β metabolites have less effective 
binding. In addition, 5αTHB, but not the 5β -reduced metabolites, activated the glucocorticoid 
receptor in vitro and suppressed ACTH in vivo, and th ese effect s were inhibited by  [CONTACT_797901] 
(23).  Increased 5α reduced metabolites have also been seen in patients with diabetes and women 
with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). These findings suggest that this pathway may be involved 
          IRB submission CR 11-16-17 
6 in the development of glucose intolerance and M etabolic Syndrome ( 24 - 25).   
 The link of cortisol to insulin resistance and the Metabolic Syndrome is further substantiated 
by [CONTACT_797902] s of mifepristone. Liu and colleagues investigated the role of tissue 
glucocorticoids in type 2 diabetes  mellitus  and obesity by [CONTACT_797903] 1 1BHSD1 in the hepatocytes of db/db mice (a model of type 2 
diabetes  mellitus ). Increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor and 11BHSD1 was associated 
with elevate d levels of corticosterone, insulin, and blood glucose. They also found that 
intraperitoneal administration of  mifepristone to the db/db mice for 3 weeks improved glucose 
tolerance with simultaneous decrease in the expression of 11BHSD1 and glucocorticoid receptor in 
the liver ( 26).  These findings were  corroborated in another study on ob/ob diabetic mice ( 27).  
Also, a dministration of mifepristone to obese Zucker rats and db/db mice prevent s high fat diet -
induced weight gain and type -2 diabetes ( 28 - 29).   
 In humans, mifepristone successfully  ameliorated  hypercortisolemia -related effects in 
patients with Cushing’s syndrome ( 30).  More recently mifepristone was approved by [CONTACT_797904]’s syndrome (3 1). In healthy men, 
administration of 400 mg of mifepristone at 2200h  led to a decrease in triglyceride levels , despi[INVESTIGATOR_797884]  (32).  Bertagna et al. looked at the antiglucocorticoid effect of 
mifepristone  in four healthy men an d found that ACTH and cortisol values increased [ADDRESS_1100455] of mifepristone on the 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_797885] ( 33), and supports the use 
of a split dosing regimen rather than a single daily dose, to minimize effects on ACTH .   
 Based on the putative role of excessive exposure to cortisol, we hypo thesized that reduction 
in cortisol action with mifepristone might reverse glucose intolerance and some of the other 
components of the metabolic syndrome, just as it reverses the features of Cushing’s syndrome 
(30).  
 The long -term aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of mifepristone  to reverse or 
improve the components of Metabolic Syndrome , specifically impaired fasting glucose, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension and visceral obesity. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_797886] s of short -term administration of mifepristone on insulin sensitivity. A second phase of the 
study will then look at the effects of long -term treatment on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], blood pressure , weight  as well 
as glucose intolerance .   
 
 
 
STUDY HYPOTHESIS  
The primary study  hypothesis is that glucose abnormalities in overweight and obese 
individuals  will improve with short -term administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist 
mifepristone . 
A secondary study hypothesis  is that a ctivation of the HPA axis will be minimal when 
mifepristone is administered in four divided daily doses of 50 mg.

Study for eligible subjects  
  
 This crossover study has two treatment arms (placebo or Mife pristone 50 mg tablets every 
six hours) with each subject serving as her own control. After eligibility is confirmed, subjects will 
undergo baseline testing and will be randomized to one of the treatment arms.  Testing will be 
performed before and at the e nd of seven days of treatment with the study agent. Study drug will 
be continued until completion of post -drug testing.  Thus, subjects will take the study drug for a 
total of nine days  during each treatment arm . There will be a washout period of at least six and no 
more than eight weeks after which subjects will be randomized to the other arm of the study with 
an identical testing schedule. Subjects will record any symptoms or adverse events on a calendar

Procedures during each treatment  
 Subjects  will be admitted to the 5SWN metabolic unit or 5NW in the Clinical Center on a 
Sunday for testing the following day.  To accommodate menstrual cycle timing, and for subjects for 
whom weekend testing is preferable, admission may occur on Friday or Saturday;  additionally the 
Day 2 and 3 testing may be swapped if needed to accommodate nursing scheduling.  To reduce 
potential variability associated with estrogen in premenopausal women, testing will be performed 
in the early follicular phase (days 1 -7 of menstru al cycle). In case of perimenopausal women with 
irregular menstrual cycles , an attempt will be made to begin  testing in the early follicular phase 
with the rest of the testing performed at pre -determined study intervals. Height, weight, and 
waist , hip and neck  circumference (mean of three measurements) will be measured. Waist 
circumference will be measured at the intersection of midaxillary line with the uppermost lateral 
border of the right iliac crest at the end of a normal expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (36). The hip circum ference will be 
measured in a horizontal plane at the level of the maximal circumference of hips and buttocks.  
Neck circumference will be measured at mid -neck height between the mid -cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_797888] 1 mm (37).  Weight will be m easured at the same time of the day on the 
same scale.  All measurements will be taken after an overnight fast with the subject standing 
upright , both arms hanging loosely by [CONTACT_797905], and eyes directed straight ahead.  Subjects 
will be maintained on an isocaloric regular diet during the inpatient part of the study. Those 
subjects who are on metformin at the time of study entry will be maintained on the same dose of 
metformin throughout the study.  
 
Day 1  (Monday)

Day 1 9 and 33  (Friday ):  Safety monitoring  
After discontinuation of study drug, subjects will return approximately one w eek (Day 19) and 
then 3 weeks (Day 33) after the last day of study drug intake for measurement of blood 
chemistries and CBC.  The research team will make every effort to ensure that these safety follow -
up visits are within [ADDRESS_1100464] convenience, we will allow 
for the follow -up visits to be within  5 days of the expected date of follow -up (day 19 ± 5 days and 
day 33 ± 5 days). In these cases, a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_797907] -up to ensure that the subject is doing well.  If any potential treatment -
related abnormalities/adverse events are noted at the safety visits, subjects will receive 
appropriate treatment for these abnormalities and will be followed closely as cli nically indicated 
until the abnormalities/adverse events have fully resolved.  
 
Second study treatment visit:  T hese study procedures will be repeated with each study drug after 
a wash -out period of [ADDRESS_1100465] convenience, we will allow for t he pre -study drug testing (Days 1 through 3) in each

continuous 1.74 mg /h infusion) for three hours and [ADDRESS_1100467] of insulin on glucose metabolism in the 
FSIVGTT.  
 
Secondary Outcomes  
1. Change in fasting plasma glucose  and insulin levels.  
2. Change in area under the curve (AUC) insulin, AUCglucose/AUCinsulin, and insulin sensitivity 
index based on OGTT.  
3. Change in pre - and post -prandial glucose levels.  
4. Change in basal triglyceride level.    
5. Change in free fatty clearance based on the effect of insulin on FFA in the FSIVGTT.  
6. Change in HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol levels.  
4. Change in weight, BMI, neck, waist and hip circumference.  It is unlikely that these parameters 
will change with the short duration of administration, however.  
5. Change in blood pressure . It is unlikely that these par ameters will change with the short 
duration of administration, however.  
6.  Whole -body rate of regenerating cortisol (measured with 9,11,12,12 -[(2)H(4)]cortisol tracer) 
will be analyzed in collaboration with [CONTACT_797919]. On metabolism by [CONTACT_797909], d4F 
loses 11alpha - deuterium, forming trideuterated cortisone (d3E) and is regenerated by [CONTACT_797910] -deuterated cortisol (d3F). 11BHSD1 reductase activity can be measured specifically as 
conversion of d3E to d3F (4 0). The amount of regenerated co rtisol at baseline will be assessed for 
correlation with basal measures of insulin sensitivity and triglyceride level s, and the change in 
these parameter s in response to mifepristone.     
7.  Adverse events will be tallied and compared between treatments.  
          IRB submission CR 11-16-[ADDRESS_1100468]. Ninet Sinaii, Ph.D. (Biostatistics and 
Clinical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_797882], Clinical Center).  Subjects will be randomized in blocks of [ADDRESS_1100469] deviations will be use d to describe continuous data. 
Proportions and frequencies will be used to describe categorical data.  All continuous data will be 
examined for normality and homogeneity of variances, and will be either transformed as 
appropriate or assessed using non -para metric tests. The change in continuous variables (including 
triglyceride, HDL, LDL and total cholesterol levels, insulin sensitivity index, pre - and post -prandial 
glucose values, whole body cortisol production rates, blood pressure, weight, and waist 
circu mference) before and after study intervention will be analyzed using paired t -tests or 
Wilcoxon signed -rank test.  Correlation of continuous data (e.g., regenerated cortisol and insulin 
sensitivity and triglyceride levels, and mifepristone level and insuli n sensitivity and triglyceride 
response) will be carried out by [CONTACT_141612]’s correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rho, as 
appropriate.  Between and within treatment comparisons will be done using Mixed Models for a 
crossover design that will also consider se quence effect, if any. Difference in the proportion of 
subjects who meet criteria for metabolic syndrome, or other categorical data, before and after 
study intervention will be analyzed using McNemar’s test. Two -sided p -values will be used for all 
analysis  and the level of statistical significance will be set a priori at 0.05. The stepdown Bonferroni 
correction will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons. All statistical analysis will be performed 
using SAS v. 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
Human data o n the effect of mifepristone on insulin sensitivity index are lacking. This will 
therefore be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_1100470] of mifepristone on glucose intolerance, lip ids, weight and blood 
pressure. With an estimated loss -to-follow -up rate of 15%, we would need to recruit a total of [ADDRESS_1100471] udy initiation .  
Based on current evidence , a compensatory rise in ACTH levels has been seen with 
mifepristone in healthy individuals at doses as low as 100 mg/day (when used as a single dose over 
3 months) and 200 mg/day over 8 days (41 - 42). Given the uncertainty in the effect of the dose, 
we plan to do  an interim analysis looking at the effect of the proposed dose (50 mg every 6 hours) 
on the HPA axis in the first 6 subjects  (one randomization block) . The data from the first [ADDRESS_1100472] 
mifepristone treatment is more than or equal to twice the upper limit of normal  in four or more of 
the six subjects , then we will decrease the mifepristone dose to  25 mg every 6 hours  (100 
mg/day) . However, if there is no significant increase in the levels (< twice the upper limit of 
normal), same dose of mifepristone will be continued throughout the study. If the mifepristone 
          IRB submission CR 11-16-[ADDRESS_1100473] six 
subjects will not be used in the final analysis and 15 additional subjects will be enrolled prior to 
completion of the study. On the other hand, if no dose adjustment is required, the study analysis 
will be done as previously planned.  
 
PHARMACEUTICAL SAFETY AND RANDOMIZATION  
 
 Mifepristone (HRA 052015; INN Mifepristone) is a cortisol and progesterone analog with 
antiprogestin and antiglucocorticoid activity. Healthy subjects receiving long -term mifepr istone 
administration showed antiglucocorticoid effects at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg, which is about 5 – 10 
fold greater than that required to demonstrate antiprogestin effects ( 43).  The agent effectively 
reverses the clinical and glucocorticoid -dependent biochemical features of Cushing’s syndrome 
(30).  The proposed doses in this protocol are about 2 – 3 mg/kg/d.  
 Mifepristone will be given under an active IND ( 113,698 ) sponsored by [CONTACT_797911] -
Pharma . Laboratoire HRA -Pharma, NICHD’s cooperative research and development partner, will 
provide mifepristone compound . The Pharmaceutical Development Service  will formulate the 
compound into 50 mg capsules .   Mifepristone will be manufactured, controlled and released 
accor ding to current GMP guidelines. A look -alike inert placebo  will be formulated into capsules by 
[CONTACT_621260] .  
 The Pharmaceutical Development Service will randomize subjects in blocks of 6  to receive 
the two treatments.  The inves tigators will not be informed of the treatment group of any 
participant while she receives study compound unless there is an adverse event requiring 
“unblinding” of the treatment.   At the interim analysis, the treatment arm assignment for the first 
[ADDRESS_1100474] of the study 
investigators will remain blinded.  
The 20% 9,11,12,12 -[2H]4-cortisol and 80% hydrocortisone  solution  will be given under an 
active IND ( 113,698 ) sponsored by  [CONTACT_625026] -Pharma . The deuterated cortisol will be purchased from 
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc  ([ADDRESS_1100475], Andover, MA.  [ZIP_CODE] -5413; phone 800 -322-
1174; WEB: www.isotope.com ). The Pharmaceutical Development Service will  perform sterility 
and pyrogenicity testing and will  formulate the 20% 9,11,12,12 -[2H]4-cortisol and 80% 
hydrocortisone  solution.  
 
 
EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
  
Benefits  
Subjects  may benefit by [CONTACT_26777] a physical examination, and laboratory testing. In addition this 
study will contribute to our understanding of the physiology pertaining to the HPA axis  and 
metabolic syndrome . 
 
Risks/Discomforts  
We believe that this study does not involve significant  risk for the volunteer subjects. The risks are 
anticipated to be greater than minimal, with the [ADDRESS_1100476] benefit to subjects .  The medical procedures include physical examination, non -
invasive tests (eg UFC and saliva collection), venipuncture and study agents  with minimal side 
          IRB submission CR 11-16-17 
15 effects  at doses being used in the study . The risk:  benefit ratio is low. The intravenous glucose 
tolerance test can be associated with greater than minimal risk , but these risks will be mitigated as 
noted below.  
1. Adrenal insufficiency  can be associated with  the use of mifepristone given its 
antiglucocortico id action. In a previous subchronic study, Laue and colleagues found that 8 
of 11 healthy volunteers receiving mifepristone 10mg/kg/day for 7 - 14 days exhibited 
generalized exanthem and one developed signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency.   In 
all cas es symptoms resolved 5 - 6 days after discontinuation of mifepristone (44). In 
another study by [CONTACT_797912], c hronic daily treatment with 200 mg  for months,  
mifepristone daily was associated with mild nausea and fatigue but no other signs and 
symptoms of  adrenal insufficiency (45). However, given the short duration of 
administration and smaller doses of mifepristone being used in this study , these effects are  
unlikely . No adverse effects  were reported after single or two -day doses of up to 400 mg in 
previ ous studies, or after 200 mg daily for 8 days (32, 33, 46).  All subjects will be educated 
on the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_797913]. Detailed history with regards to signs and 
symptoms of adrenal insufficiency will also be taken during the study  visits . 
2. Hypoglycemia  is a risk associated with the frequently sampled intravenous glucose 
tolerance test after insulin administration. The dose of insulin will be calculated  
meticulously and the test will be performed in a strictly monitored setting , with frequent 
measurement of glucose and the ability to administer additional glucose should 
hypoglycemia occur. Also, we believe that the risk of hypoglycemia with anticipated 
improvement in glucose intolerance on study drug in subjects on  a stable dose of 
metformin is minimal. Glucose levels will however be monitored at every follow -up visit 
during the study.  
3. Deuterated isotopes used to evaluate cortisol and cortisone dynamics are not radioactive 
and are not expected to have adverse effect s. 
4. Endometrial hyperplasia and vaginal bleeding  is a theoretical risk with long -term 
administration of mifepristone. However, given the short duration of drug administration 
in this study we do not anticipate this effect . Postmenopausal w omen will be scree ned for 
pre-existing endometrial hyperplasia by [CONTACT_797914].  An MRI Pelvis will be performed if the transvaginal 
ultrasound is unable to provide an accurate measurement of the endometr ial stripe. 
Subjects in whom a definite assessment of endometrial thickness cannot be made with 
either ultrasound or MRI (as may be the case in patients with multiple fibroids) will be 
followed closely for any abnormal vaginal bleeding and will undergo a r epeat transvaginal 
ultrasound upon completion of the study.  
5. Phlebotomy is associated with mild discomfort and the possibility of bruising. There is a 
small risk of fainting, bleeding, or of infection. These will be minimized by [CONTACT_797915] a se ated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_797890].  
6. Time  involved in clinic visit and inpatient stay may be a discomfort. Every effort will be 
made to streamline the visits, and the amount of time required will be specified in the 
consent form as cle arly as possible.  Women will be allowed to go out on pass when no 
testing is scheduled.  
          IRB submission CR 11-16-17 
16 7. Anemia  is a possible risk of phlebotomy. The total blood withdrawal over a six week period 
will be 425 ml which is within the N IH guideline of 450 ml for adults or 7ml /kg/[ADDRESS_1100477] will be obtained for all women at the screening visit 
and prior to study drug initiation. Women will be counseled regarding the risk of 
termination of pregnancy associated with study drug intake and will be asked to use non -
hormonal contraceptive methods if they are sexually active duri ng the study and for one 
month after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788].  
9. Hypokalemia  has been seen with the use of mifepristone in Cushing’s syndrome . However, 
this is related to the significantly elevated cortisol levels seen in Cushing’s syndrome  which 
overwhelm the 11BHSD2 enzyme leading to hypokalemia via its action at the 
mineralocorticoid receptor. Even if a compensatory rise in ACTH and cortisol level is seen 
with the low dose of mifepristone being used in this study, we do not anticipate the  
cortisol levels to go high enough to cause hypokalemia.  However, a comprehensive 
metabolic panel that will include a potassium level will be checked both at the post -
treatment visit (after 7 days of treatment with drug) as well as at the time of the safe ty visit 
(1 week after discontinuation of the study drug).  
10. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radiowaves instead of x -rays and therefore does not 
have any  associated risk of radiation exposure. Patients are at risk for injury from the MRI 
magnet if they  have pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, dental implants, 
aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including 
metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_32284], heart valves and cochlear implants), implanted delivery pump or 
shrapne l fragments. All subjects will be screened for these conditions prior to the study. 
Women of child bearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed before the MRI. 
Gadolinium -based contrast agents may be used with the MRI study. Subjects will be 
screened for any history of  allergic reactions to these agents prior to administration. MRI 
evaluations may cause claustrophobia.  Should this occur the study will be stopped and re -
scheduled with administration of a sedative if needed.  
 
Subject Monitoring  
Detailed history will be obtained from the subjects both before and at the end of each 
treatment with regards to medication compliance and any side effects associated with the 
medication. The NICHD Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review lab resul ts after the 
first [ADDRESS_1100478] medical occurrence that 
at any medication dose or formulation causes death, is life -threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or resu lts in significant disability. Medical judgment will be 
exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in case of medical events that 
may not be immediately life -threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_797891]. All serious adverse events occurring during the study, both patient -
reported and those observed by [CONTACT_797916] 10 days of our own notification .  Non -serious adverse eve nts will be reported 
annually to the FDA.  
 An unanticipated problem will be defined as any incident, experience, or outcome 
that is unexpected, related/possibly related to participation in the study and suggests that 
the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known 
or recognized. These events will be reported to the IRB and Clinical Director within 7 
(serious) or 14 (non -serious) days.    
 Protocol violations and deviations will be reported to the IRB, except for th e 
following : The protocol involves several serial tests, some with blood draws over [ADDRESS_1100479] has a reliable IV access prior to initiation of 
study procedures and the IV line is flushed intermittently to main tain access. However, we 
anticipate that blood draws may still be missed or delayed due to IV access issues ~10% of 
the time. We will monitor and keep a record of these but will report it as a protocol 
deviation to the IRB only if this happens > 10% of the  time.  
 
 
HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION  
 
Gender, ethnicity and age considerations for subject selection:    
          IRB submission CR 11-16-17 
18 This study will focus on men and women of all ethnicities in the age group of 35 – [ADDRESS_1100480] of treatment with mifepristone will be different based on 
gender  or ethnicity .  
 
Recruitment strategies:  Subjects will be obtained through referrals from individuals studied under 
the NIDDK phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_100624] [ADDRESS_1100481], mailings to physicians, 
advertisements in local newspapers, posting messages on listserves, social networking sites (like 
facebook and twitter), local online classified pages (like Cr aigslist) and via the clinical center web 
page. We will submit these postings and proposed language to the IRB for approval.   If employees 
are recruited, they will receive the NIH Information Sheet on Staff Research Participation per NIH 
HRPP SOP 14E, Rese arch Involving NIH Staff as Subjects.  Every effort will be made to ensure 
confidentiality of collected information; we do not anticipate a need to collect sensitive 
information such as sexual behavior, or HIV status.  Consent will be obtained as outlined in SOP 
14E.  
 
 
Consent Procedures : The Patient Recruitment and Patient Liaison group will initially screen 
potential subjects.  The research team will call subjects for further screening, provide the consent 
form,  and offer participation.  The study will be  explained verbally and all questions and concerns 
addressed by [CONTACT_797917].   This telephone call will be used to explore 
eligibility for participation, as well as feasibility, given the time commitment, and whether the 
subject is able to travel to NIH.  
 
Written informed consent will be obtained from the participant prior to any s tudy procedures or 
treatments. The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_797892] (listed 
on the protocol’s face page) are clinically trained and have experience in obtaining informed 
consent, and know the protocol very well.  The informed consent process and protections (e.g. 
lack of coercion) will be carried out as per NIH HRPP  SOP 12, Requirements for Informed Consent.  
 
We do not plan or anticipate the enrollment of non -English speaking subjects; however they are 
not exclud ed from participation either. Should a non -English speaking subject be eligible for 
enrollment, IRB approval will be obtained for use of the short form consent process in the absence 
of a fully translated consent document as outline d in SOP 12.9.1, under t he provisions of 45 CFR 
46.117(b)(2). IRB approval will be obtained according to IRB guidance prior to obtaining informed 
consent from the potential study participant/s.  
 
CONFIDENTIALITY AND USE OF RETAINED SPECIMENS  
 Study subjects will be informed at the  time of consent that the investigators will not 
provide direct care or counseling for conditions revealed by [CONTACT_797918], 
but that the subject will be referred appropriately for further medical evaluation and treatment of 
any ab normal findings.  
 Samples will be stored according to NICHD and NIH policy in the NICHD biorepository 
(serum/plasma/urine). Subjects will be asked if samples obtained during the study can be used in 
          IRB submission CR 11-16-[ADDRESS_1100482] 
procedures that would not be included in routine physical examination.  The reimbursement 
amount based on mandatory NIH compensation for inpatient and outpatient visits will be as 
follows: 12 inpatient visit days ( 12 x $40 = $ 480), 2 outpatient visits lasting > 1 hour – screening 
visit and transvaginal ultrasound ($30 x 2 = $60) and 4 outpatient safety visits lasting < 1 hour 
duration ($20 x  4 = $80). Thus according to the mandated NIH compensation, they would receive 
$620. Addit ional compensation of $60 ($40 + $20) will be given to subjects who undergo an MRI 
Pelvis when the endometrial thickness cannot be assessed precisely on the transvaginal ultrasound 
(as in the presence of multiple fibroids).  Inconvenience units will be ass igned as follows : 
Investigational drug ( 4 units = $ 40), 12 days of multiple blood sampling (1 unit x 12 = $120), and 4  
days of outpatient blood draws ( 2 units = $20) and a completion bonus of $100 . Thus, total  
compensation would be up to $960 for those who  complete the study.  
 We also propose to provide travel compensation for all subjects, either metro fare or 
mileage.   
 
 
OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES AND COLLABORATORS  
The NIH has a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with 
Laboratoire HRA -Pharma, in Paris, [LOCATION_009].  The intention of the CRADA is to develop mifepristone 
for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome, for use as an adjunctive agent for Octreoscan, and for 
use as a diagnostic agent .

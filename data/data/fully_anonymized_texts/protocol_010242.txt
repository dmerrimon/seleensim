3. JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION 
 
The risk -benefit profile for soft (hydrophilic) daily wear contact [CONTACT_224033] .  This clinical investigation plan was designed based on 
the FDA guidance titled Premarket Notification [510(k)] Guidance Document for Class II 
Daily Wear Contact [CONTACT_224034] s, and ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2009(E) – Ophthalmic optics -  contact [CONTACT_224035] - guidance for clinical investigations . 
    
   
   
Unicon  Optical Co., Ltd.   Protocol#: AVDR [ADDRESS_269517] lenses studies  are considered to be a non- significant risk studies  based 
on United State s Food and Drug administration (FDA)
2 and International Standards 
Organization (ISO) guidelines. The investigational contact [CONTACT_224036][INVESTIGATOR_223981].  
 All the assessments are routine clinical procedures , and none pre sent any increased risk to 
subjects compared with normal clinical routine for eye examination and contact [CONTACT_224037].  
 The risks associated with wearing the study contact [CONTACT_224038] (hydrophilic) s ilicone hydrogel  contact [CONTACT_13293].  These 
include discomfort during adaptation period, eye irritation, pain, redness and swelling;  a 
painful scrape or scratch on the surface of the clear part of the eye ; blurred vision and 
sensation of dry eyes.  More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293] -related infections are very infrequent, they may 
occur.  The incidence of infection due to daily wear lenses is relatively very low
3.  
Almost always an infect ion will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by [CONTACT_26813] [ADDRESS_269518] prior to dispensing and by [CONTACT_224039] -up visit frequency associated with 
the study than routine practice that will allow the investigator to re -enforce the 
importance of following a compliant behavior.

sponsor and CRO staff without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) or regulations.  The subjects’ willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be determined.  
The subject will be given sufficient time to read the informed  consent form and 
Unicon  Optical Co., Ltd.   Protocol#: AVDR [ADDRESS_269531].  An Affidavit of Informed Consent will be 
completed for the clinical monitor to confirm that consent was obtained.  
 
6.4.2. Remote Enrolment Procedures  
 The Informed Consent form may be electronic ally distributed (i.e. email or fax)  to 
potential participants , and the investigator or delegated study personnel  may  
remote ly review the Informed Consent  form content and address initial questions 
via phone or video conferencing (e.g. Zoom) .  Remote I nformed C onsent review 
is optional to investigators and subjects and is supplemental to  the in -person 
informed consent process .  In all cases an in- person review of the Informed 
Consent form , as described in the above enrolment procedures, must occur at the 
scheduled in- person scre ening visit.  Each investigational site will determine if the 
Informed Consent signing may be conduct ed remotely using electronic signature 
(e.g. Docusign), or if all Informed Consent  forms shall be signed during the in-
person screening visit. 
 
6.4.3. Study Pro cedures  
 
At the first visit after informed consent has been given, the investigator will review the subject’s medical history, ocular history (including concomitant 
treatments), demographics and contact [CONTACT_224049].  The subject will complete a baseline sympt oms questionnaire. A series of routine optometric 
assessments and tests will be conducted to evaluate the subject’s ocular health and refractive status. This will include measurement of manifest sphero -cylindrical 
refraction , best sphere refraction  and res ultant visual acuity, ke ratometry , and 
biomicroscopy (slit -lamp examination).  Once it has been verified that the subject 
meets the inclusion / exclusion criteria the test lens parameters will be determined based on Rx.  The lens parameters will be recorde d, and the subject will be 
randomized  to receive the test or control lens es, which will be dispensed from a 
stock at the site .  After insertion of the  study lenses  the fit and visual acuity will 
be evaluated and an over -refraction  with visual acuity  will be performed.  The 
subject  will be educated on  safe contact [CONTACT_19584] , and will be instructed to wear 
the study lenses  on a one -month replacement schedule for  at least [ADDRESS_269532] will be provided with Biotrue or ClearCare for routine cleaning, disinfection and storage ; and will be educated  on 
the daily care regimen for the study lenses .  At the conclusion of the visit , follow -

There will be five  scheduled follow -up visits during the treatment period at the 
following intervals: [ADDRESS_269533] will 
complete a  symptom  questionnair e, and a series of routine optometric assessments 
Unicon  Optical Co., Ltd.   Protocol#: AVDR [ADDRESS_269534]’s ocular health and refractive 
status.  This will include measurement of manifest sphero -cylindrical refraction , 
best sphere refraction  and resultant visual acuity , visual acuity with contact [CONTACT_13293], 
over-refraction with visual acuity, and biomicroscopy (slit -lamp examination) 
including evaluation of the fit  and surface of the study lens. Additionally, on the 
[ADDRESS_269535] will be instructed to continue to wear and care for the  study lenses, and the 
next follow -up visit will be scheduled.  Additional supply of study lenses and care 
solution will be dispensed on Day 30 and Day 60 visits (or as needed).   At the completion of the [ADDRESS_269536] will be  discharged from the study and a 
Trial Exit Form will be completed.  
 
6.4.4. Remote Study Procedures  
 
With cons ideration for the cu rrent global pandemic (COVID -19), the follow -up 
study visit procedures  listed below  may be conducted remotely (via telephone or 
video conference ) and recorded on the eCRF  to reduce physical exposure time 
between the subjects and study personnel:   
• Questionnaires (vision/comfort/handling/wear time/symptoms)  
• Changes in medication (c oncomitant treatments ) and health history 
• Scheduling  
All remote reporting of questionnaires must occur on the same calendar day of the scheduled in- person visit and must be prior to the visit .  Scheduling may occur  
remotely  at any time between visits.  Any eligible procedure s not conducted

subject population, facilities, and equipment with respect to the needs of the study and to train  the investigator to  the clinical investigation plan . 
• On an ongoing basis CRO  representatives  will remotely monitor study records and 
data.  
• CRO  representatives may visit the clinical site during the study  (interim visit)  to 
review study progress and verify source documents if needed.   
• Telephone /email consultation will occur as necessary during the course of the 
investigation  to ensure the proper progress and documentation of the study 
findings. 
• CRO  representatives will meet with the investigator(s) at the completion  of the 
investigation  in order to  verify accuracy of data to source documents (when 
applicable), complete disposition of study materials, and study close out activities.  
 7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 The CRO will manage data analysis  and reporting. Subject characteristics and study conduct 
summaries will be reported —including tables such as a subject disposition table, demographics 
and baseline characteristics tables (including age, gender, baseline refraction, lens wear experience), summary table of screen failures by [CONTACT_48933], accountability of eyes enrolled , and 
subjects excluded from key analysis sets.  
 All descriptive summary statistics will be displayed with n and % for categorical data, and with mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous data. The unit will be ey e.  Tables will be presented by [CONTACT_11763].  Slit lamp findings will be presented 
by [CONTACT_224059], tabulated by [CONTACT_224060], completed control lens group, discontinued test lens group and discontinue d control eyes 
group.  Primary and secondary outcomes  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_224061].  As 
such, there are no statistical hypotheses to be tested.  Trend analysis profile will be provided following directions provided in the FDA guidance Premarket Notification [510(k)] Guidance Document for Class II Daily Wear Contact [CONTACT_32993] .  
All participants who meet the eligibility criteria, adhere to the protocol, and successfully complete the full study assessment will be available for the per -protocol analysis. Subjects 
with missing data will be included in the analysis unless there is some non -response -related 
reason to exclude them, such as a protocol violation/invalid data.  Data from all enrolled subjects  will be used for reporting of a dverse events  or other safety related outcomes .

 8. DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
The clinical data will be recorded  directly  on electronic case report forms (eCRFs)  generated 
using A ndre Vision and Device Research eClinical Software .  All data captured with this 
software will be stored  using the secure Amazon Web Services Cloud .  
 The eCRFs constitute the subjects’ original source documents , which will be reviewed for 
accuracy and comprehensiveness by [CONTACT_224062].  The content and structure of the eCRFs are compliant with 21 CFR Part 11. 
 
Electronic Case Report Form s (eCRF):  
 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) access will be made available to the sites.  A sample of the case report form s are found i n Appendix 3.  Only designated individuals will receive a user 
account to access and complete the eCRFs.  Upon completion, the independent investigator 
will electronically sign the eCRF.  Upon completion, the subject identifiers will be recorded 
on the eCRFs beyond subject number and demographic information.  
 If any study information is collected using an automated pi[INVESTIGATOR_502], and if the 
automated instrument has a printe d output, the printed output will be kept in the subject’s 
clinical file as a source document with the subject number and the date of recording noted on the printout.  The eCRFs are time stamped with full audit trail for any changes made.  In the event of a query 
being raised by [CONTACT_224063] M onitor, a data flag will be raised for the investigator to review.  
Complete tracking information containing the change, the person making the change, the date and time of the change and the reason for the change are to  be documented on the eCRF 
Correction Log.  
 Additional Source Documents:  
 Adequate original records will be maintained for the study, including subject medical records  
(if used), data collection forms, worksheets, exam printouts, investigator/ tech notes, signed 
informed consent forms, device use records, adverse event documentation, and information regarding subjects who discontinue. 
 
Records Retention:  
 The investigator will maintain the following accurate, complete, and current records relating 
to the investigator’s participation in this study:  
 
• All correspondence with another investigator, the IRB , CRO, the study monitor, and 
regulatory bodies  
• Records of re ceipt, use or disposition of the investigational device  
• Records of each subject’s case history and exposure to the investigational device

  May 28th, 2020  
 
Andre Vision and D evice Research  Follow -up Visits Case Report Form  33 
 The investigator will maintain these records during the investigation and for a period of seven 
(7) years after the d ate on which the investigation is terminated or completed.  
 9. AMENDMENTS TO THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 The Sponsor , CRO, or Investigators  may determine that an amendment to the clinical 
investigational plan is necessary  following IRB and IDE approv al.  When the Sponsor and 
Investigators  have agreed to the amend ed investigational plan, it will be submitted to the IRB 
and FDA (via IDE supplement)  for approval.  Investigators may not follow the amended 
protocol until receiving approval letters for the IRB and FDA unless  the changes affect  the 
subjects ’ rights, safety and wellbeing, or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation .  
If the changes are minor  (such as a technical change related to subject scheduling) , 
amendment may be applied with a “note -to-file” in lieu of submitting a supplement to the 
IDE.   All amendments, including minor amendments, will be submitted to the IRB for 
approval prior to implementation.  In the event that the  clinical investigational plan has been amended , all Investigators and 
coordinators involved in the study will be trained to the new procedures  prior to 
implementation.  
 
10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received prior sponsor and IRB approval. Protocol deviations can be major or minor. All protocol 
deviations  must be reported on the Protocol Deviation Form eCRF.  If the  deviation affects 
subject ’s rights, safety and wellbeing, or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation, 
the IRB must be contact[CONTACT_224064], and reports of deviations. Under 
emergency circumstances, deviations from the clin ical investigational plan to protect the rights, 
safety and well -being of subject s may proceed without prior approval of the sponsor and the 
IRB.  Such deviations shall be documented and reported to the sponsor and the IRB as soon as 
possible.  Throughout the course of the study the Clinical Monitor will review study data for subject and 
investigator compliance to the protocol.  Non -compliances will be documented as protocol 
deviation(s).  If a deviation is determined to be major, the deviation will be reported to the IRB 
as per reporting requirements.  
 Major Protocol Deviations:  
 Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessa ry to 
ensure the safety and welfare of the subject s. 
 The following are examples of protocol deviations that must be reported to the IRB : 
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to subject s; 
Unicon  Optical Co., Ltd.   Protocol#: AVDR 201 9-05 v1.1 
  May 28th, 2020  
 
Andre Vision and D evice Research  Follow -up Visits Case Report Form  34 
 • Enrolment of subject s outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed 
to or not by [CONTACT_456];  
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention proce dures or timing of the 
research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study-
related intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; incorrect ver sion of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
Minor Protocol Deviations:  
 Protocol deviations caused by [CONTACT_224065] s are generally 
considered minor, and normally are not reported to the IRB unless these results i n increased 
risk to the subject s).  
 The following are examples of protocol deviations that are considered minor and do not require reporting to the IRB: 
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study subject  missed 
appointment, change in appointment date);  
• Inadvertent deviati on in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not  impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study-
related intervention or upon the experimental design ( e.g., missing a measurement 
during a session that i s not considered critical for the study).  
 11. DEVICE ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Access to investigational devices will be  controlled and the investigational devices are to be 
used only in the clinical investigation.  All study products will be stored in a secure environment at room temperature.  Access is to be limited to key study personnel.  No 
investigational device will be released until the investigator has received IRB approval to conduct the study.  Once released to the investigator, all investigational device inventories will be monitored and accounted for throughout the course of the study.   
 The Sponsor will maintain records that documents the physical location of all investigational devices from shipment of investigational devices to the investigation s ites until return or 
disposal. The Investigator will maintain  the Study Product  Shipment Receipt  Log and 
Dispensing and Accountability L ogs.  These records include:  
 
• the date of receipt,  
• identification of each investigational device (batch number/serial nu mber or unique 
code),  
• the expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695]  (if applicable ), 
• the date or dates of use,  
• subject identification,  
• date on which the investigational device was returned/explanted from subject and  
• the date of return of unused, expi[INVESTIGATOR_223985] l devices.    
 
Unicon  Optical Co., Ltd.   Protocol#: AVDR [ADDRESS_269540] is reconciled and any discrepancies are investigated 
and either corrected or documented. At the conclusion of the study all investigational devices  
will be reconciled . Once the reconciliation of all devices has been  documented by [CONTACT_224066], the remaining collected devices will be disposed using municipal services . 
  Investigational Device Packaging and Labeling:  
 The investigational test c ontact lenses will be  supplied sterile in sealed blister packs containing 
isotonic phosphate buffered saline . The package labeling is printed with lot numbering, 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_223986] .   
 The lenses will be shipped to all study sites with an open label.  A n invoice with ‘Caution – 
Investiga tional Device Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or US) Law to Investigational Use, and ‘to  be used 
by [CONTACT_224067]’ will be included with the lenses.    Neither CRO  nor the investigator may represent the investigational test device as safe or 
effective f or the purpose for which it is under clinical study or otherwise promote the product.

it is considered to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘serious 
adverse events’  or ‘significant adverse events’ as defined below.  
Classification  Definition and condition  Reporting  
Serious Adverse 
Events  Serious AEs are those events that result in, or have potential to cause, either permanent 
impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure, and may 
necessitate medical or surgical intervention.  
Serious AEs may include any hazardous, sight -threatening conditions occurring after 
exposure to test article, including but not limited to the following.

Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  Notify sponsor 
immediately; 
IRB and FDA reporting as per 
requirements  
 
 
Procedures for Handling Adverse Events:  
 Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the inve stigator , the subject  may be referred to a pre-designated  ophthalmologist 
for treatment. The investigator will attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the contact [CONTACT_224072] a result of other factors. An Adverse Event Form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, each eye will be counted as one adverse event and Adverse Event information will be completed for each eye. Whenever possible, the adverse 
event will be photo- documented. 
 In any case of a corneal infiltrate with overlying full thickness epi[INVESTIGATOR_223987], or in any case of presumed corneal keratitis a culture will be taken in accordance with the procedures identified in Premarket Notification [510(k)] Guidance Document for Class II Daily Wear Contact 
[CONTACT_32993] , which may be referenced in Appendix 4 of this protocol. T he investigator will 
immediately (same business day) report cases that require culturing  to the Medical Monitor 
and CRO.   
 
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participat ion will be paid by [CONTACT_103] (bills and prescription receipts kept). The subject  must be followed until resolution 
and a written report completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  Procedures for Reporting Adverse Even ts: 
 All serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related to 
participation will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223988] 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_223989]., Ltd.   Protocol#: AVDR [ADDRESS_269545] (IRB)  as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_269546] learns of the event ( 21 CFR  812.150(a)(1)) . All fatal 
or life -threatening events will be reported im mediately to the IRB. 
 
The CRO/Sponsor  will immediately conduct an evaluation of a n UADE and will report the 
results of the evaluation to FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_269547] ( 21 CFR 812.46(b), 
812.150(b)(1)) . 
 All adverse events —including non- serious adve rse events that are not related to the device—
will be documented and submitted by [CONTACT_224073].  In the final  
clinical report  for this study all adverse events, regardless of classification (i.e. non -device 
related, serious, s ignificant, and non- significant), will be reported.  
 Medical Monitor Responsibilities:  
 The Medical Monitor will be a physician specializing in optometry or ophthalmology. To reduce study bias concerns, the Medical Monitor will not have any real or potenti al conflict of 
interest with the Sponsor, Study Investigator or participating Investigative site.   The primary purpose of the Medical Monitor is to ensure an independent review all Serious Adverse Events (SAE), device- related Adverse Events and AE related  to the safety endpoints. 
When reviewing SAE and device -related adverse events, the Medical Monitor will report the 
relationship between the AE and the study device and the study procedure. The results of all 
events reviewed by [CONTACT_224074].  
 The Medical Monitor will be  [CONTACT_224103] , who is contracted by [CONTACT_224075].  
 
Device Deficiencies:  
 A device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  All device deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance of an investigational medical device is documented throughout the clinical investigation on the Device Deficiency Form ( eCRF ).  All 
device deficiencies will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] C linical Monitor .  If it is determined by [CONTACT_941] C linical 
Monitor and Medical Monitor tha t the deficiency could have led to a serious adverse device 
effect , the event will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_269548] learns of the event .

origin. All corneal ulcers shall be recorded in the study report.  
Type of Adverse Event :______________________  
Classification  Definition and condition  Reporting  
Serious 
Adverse 
Events (SAE)  Serious Adverse Device Events are those events that result in, or have 
potential to cause, either permanent impairment of an ocular function or 
damage to an ocular structure, and may necessitate medical or surgical intervention.  
Serious AEs may include an y hazardous, sight -threatening conditions 
occurring after exposure to test article, including but not limited to the following.  
a) A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal tissue). Signs may include irregular focal infi ltrates (> 1 
mm); active lesions with raised edges; significant diffuse infiltration; anterior corneal to mid -stromal involvement; erosion 
with overlying staining; conjunctival and lid edema; anterior 
chamber reaction (iritis); severe bulbar and limbal red ness. 
Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial 
keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset; severe redness; purulent 
or mucopurulent discharge; tearing; photophobia. For the purposes of reporting, a corneal ulcer which has any of the following characteristics should be considered in this category:  Notify sponsor 
as soon as 
possible, within 24 hrs; IRB and FDA 
reporting as 
per 
requirements

 1) central or paracentral location;  
2) penetration of Bowman’s membrane;  
3) infiltrate > 2 mm diameter;  
4) associated with iritis ≥ grade 2;  
5) associated with any increase in intraocular pressure;  
6) culture positive for microorganisms;  
7) increasing size or severity at subsequent visits.  
b) Any central or paracentral corneal event (such as 
vascularization) that results in permanent opacification.  
c) Any serious adverse ophthalmic ev ents including hypopyon and 
hyphema.  
d) Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea.  
e) The loss of two or more lines of visual acuity that fail to resolve.  
f) All cases of iritis.  
Significant 
but non-
serious adverse 
events  Significant but non -serious AEs should include, but not be limited to:  
— peripheral non- progressive non -infectious ulcers;  
— all symptomatic corneal infiltrative events;  
— all cases of corneal staining greater than or equal to grade 3;  
— a temporary loss of ten or more letters of best spectacle 
corrected visual acuity (for  greater than or equal to 2 weeks);  
— cases greater than or equal to grade 2 neovascularization;  
— any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens 
discontinuation of greater than or equal to 2 weeks;  
— lens adhesion or lens binding to the cornea;  
— significantly distorted corneal topography (significant distortion 
of keratometry mires or aberrant findings in corneal topography);  
— any ocular AE that requires the practitioner’s intervention, 
including medication (not including minimal lubrication).   Notify sponsor 
as soon as 
possible, no 
later than 10 business days ; 
IRB and FDA 
reporting as 
per 
requirements  
Unanticipated 
Adverse 
Device Effects 
(UADE)  Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or sight -threatening, or 
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (includi ng a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  Notify sponsor 
and IRB as soon as 
possible, but 
no later than 
10 business 
days, if even ts 
that are fatal 
or life threatening, report

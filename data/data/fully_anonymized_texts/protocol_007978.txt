Protocol Version 1  dated December 6 , 2016          Page 3 of 8 1. STUDY DESIGN   
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_430789] a ssess pi[INVESTIGATOR_430790], the Hitachi -Aloka high resolution pi[INVESTIGATOR_430791] (LV) septal 
thickness during cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430797]. We will 
assess if septal thickness can be visualized during the procedure and  if it is likely to improve the efficacy 
and safety of the procedure. The probe ha s FDA clearance for  a variety of   intra -operative surgical 
procedure s but will be off -label for this cardiac surgical protocol. Attached is a memo from the 
manufacturer stati ng the device does not meet criteria of a “significant risk device” as per 21 CFR 
812.3(m).  
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
The objective of this research project is to assess the  utility  an ultrasound probe that is currently 
clinically used to assess pi[INVESTIGATOR_430792], the Hitachi -Aloka high resolution pi[INVESTIGATOR_430793] (LV) septal thickness during cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430798] l myectomy . 
 
3. RATIONALE  
There is current ly no way to monitor the depth of surgical septal myectomy during the on -pump period 
in the OR. This is because the heart is empty of blood and transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE) 
imaging is impossible. Also epi[INVESTIGATOR_430794]. The brochure (attached separately) shows 
the probe we believe will let us image the septum. It may make the surgical procedure more accurate 
and decrease complications of “too little myectomy” or “too much myectomy”. Both can decrease the 
need for reoperation which is currently a risk of myectomy 1 -2%. The probe is a sterile one -time -use 
device.  The transducer itself is 2.[ADDRESS_544894] tested the probe  in a simulation similar 
to that  we will encounter during Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) surgery and there was excellent 
visualization of muscular thickness with 1:[ADDRESS_544895] lesion (callous) and confirmed 
by [CONTACT_430799]. After resection the residual thickness of the septum will be 
measured both by [CONTACT_430800] -cardiopu lmonary by[CONTACT_430801]. The thickness of the surgical 
specimen will be measured.   The differences between the OPIE and TEE measured septal thicknesses  
provide the primary data points for the statistical analysis.    
We estimate that the cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430802] [ADDRESS_544896] -op care.  
 
In general, results from studies, which use data, collected as part of this research will be prelimina ry, 
and the clinical implications of any findings may not be understood for years. Therefore, individual 
study results will not be disclosed to the patient and/or his or her healthcare provider(s). Data will be 
stored in a database housed within the Depart ment of Cardiothoracic Surgery. The above mentioned 
database will be stored until the end of the study in a password protected secure computer server 
accessible only by [CONTACT_16310], co -investigators and research staff listed for this project .  
 
Sample size and data analysis:  
Each of the [ADDRESS_544897] 4 measurements(OPIE & TEE before cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430803] & TEE after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]) in the septum using two techniques (TEE and OPIE 
Ultrasound Probe). Primary outcome i s the the difference between TEE measured septal thickness and 
the OPIE measured thickness before and after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. Center tendency 
parameters(mean, standard deviation) will be reported for each outcome. For example: we will report 
the mean  and standard deviation for the difference between TEE measured septal thickness and OPIE 
measured thickness before and after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476].  The OPIE and TEE measurements will 
be compared both before and after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430804] t he outcome as well.  Accurate 
myectomy residual thickness is vital for success of this operation.  The clinical utility of the OPIE probe 
will be shown if there is a >= 2mm difference (either greater than or less than) between a ny single  
OPIE measurement a nd the TEE measurement  either before cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430805].  Given the critical nature of the assessment of septal thickness, even a [ADDRESS_544898] one patient  (10% of patients)  is  deemed essential informatio n. 
5. SUBJECTS POPULATION SELECTION   
Patients who are seen by [CONTACT_430806] (HCM) Clinic and will undergo surg ical 
 
 
Protocol Version 1  dated December 6 , 2016          Page 5 of 8 myectomy  for management of their HCM will be considered for this study.  
 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
All patients , inclusive  of male and female  and all racial/ethnic origin s, age [ADDRESS_544899]’s health information may continue to be disclosed for research as 
described in this protocol.  
 
To withdraw consent and/or revoke authorization, subjects may contact [CONTACT_430807].  
 
6. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
There will not be an immediate benefit to subjects enrolled in this study . This study seeks to  improve 
the ability to monitor the depth of surgical septal myectomy during the on -pump period in the OR. 
This might lead to improved clinical care in the future . 
 
7. POTENTIAL RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
There are minimal risks to subjects .  Although health information that is collected will be kept in a 
secure server , there is always the risk that it may be accessed by [CONTACT_430808]. Efforts will be made to protect confidentiality as outlined in this protocol.  We estimate that the 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_430809] [ADDRESS_544900] Recruitment and Compensation  
Subjects will be drawn from patients seen at the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Clinic  and those 
scheduled to undergo septal myectomy  cardio surgery within the [LOCATION_001] University Langone 
Medical C enter.   These subjects will be under the care of both the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5773] -investigator.  The 
study will be described by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_430795] > [ADDRESS_544901] will be given adequate time to read the consent form, ask questions, and consider study 
participation. Al l questions and/or clarifications, which the subject may have or need, will be addressed 
to their satisfaction before the consent is signed. Most of the patient’s data will be gathered from the 
medical chart; however, the subject may be asked some question s regarding changes or latest updates 
in his/her current medications.  Informed consent for this study, scanned into EPIC, will be confirmed 
at the time -out prior to surgery.  
 
This study provides no additional cost to a subject. T here are no interventions or procedures involved 
in this study that would be billable to the subject  other than the standard of care . Subjects will not 
receive compensation for their participation in this project.  
 
9. STUDY MANAGEMENT AND PERSONNEL  
The Principle Investigator for this research project will analyze and store the data . The Principle 
investigat or will  store the data on a secure NYU server on a locked computer, where  access will be 
restricted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_430796].  
 
All Investigators  and study personnel involved in this study have completed the appropriate human 
subjects’ research training (NYU CITI module) .  
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol Version [ADDRESS_544902]’s medical record number. Access to the key code linking the 
coded identification to the patient’s medical record number will be restricted to the principle 
investigator, co -investigators and research staff. All dat a, including the key code, will be stored on a 
secure, password protected computer server housed in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery.  
 
Data provided to requesting researchers will be stripped of identifiers. Only the principle investigator, 
co-investigators and research staff listed on this protocol will have access to the key code linking the 
specimen and data to the subject’s medical record number. The de -identified information allowed to 
investigators will always be subject to prior IRB review a nd approval.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
[CONTACT_430810], Director of Echocardiography will be responsible for monitoring the conduct and 
safety of the study.  [CONTACT_430811] is Associate Professor, Department of Medicine and Clinical Director, 
Non -Invasive Cardiology.  
[CONTACT_430811] will review the chart and clinical course of the patients to confirm safety of the performance 
of the protocol. He will review safety after every other c ase. All complications will be noted and he 
will evaluate whether there is relation to the OPIE: mortality, infection, cerebrovascular events. 
Complications will be determined to be either definitely related, possibly related, or definitely 
unrelated.   
If there is a definite or possible relation of a complication to the OPIE, the adverse event will be 
reported to the IRB within a week of the operation.  
It there is an adverse event that is deemed definitely related to the OPIE the study will be stopped 
pending comprehensive review.  
Reports from [CONTACT_430811] will be forwarded to the IRB after 6 cases and after 10 cases.

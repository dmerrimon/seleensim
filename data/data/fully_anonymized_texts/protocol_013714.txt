 4  Objectives:  
1. To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous busulfan (Busulfan®) in 
combination with fludarabine  as conditioning re gimen for transplantation with in-vivo T-cell 
depletion 2. To evaluate disease free and overall survival after this conditioning regimen in patients with advanced AML and MDS. 3. To evaluate potential pharmacogenomic determ inants of toxicity of this regimen. 
4. To evaluate potential pharmacogenomic dete rminants of efficacy of this regimen. 
 
 
Statistics: 
The phase I portion of the trial will use the modified continual reassessment method (CRM) to  
determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The primary endpoint fo r the phase II trial will be the
disease-free survival rate (DFS) at one year, and a Simon two-stage design will be used to test  
the null hypothesis that the one-year DFS rate is 25% against the altern ative that it is at least 40%.   
Adverse events will be monitore d, and multiple regression, logistic regression, and Cox regression 
analyses will be performed to examine the a ssociation between GSTA1 enzymatic activity and 
busulfan metabolic rate, GSTA1 en zymatic activity and the incide nce of toxicity, and pharmaco- 
genomic predictors of DFS, respectively.

5.0 BACKGROUND 
5.1 Allogeneic transplantation in advanced  hematologic 
malignancies. 
 
Allogeneic transplantation has been extens ively used for the treatment of advanced 
hematologic malignancies and results in durable remissions in approximately 30% 
of patients. Besides patient related factor s, the outcome of transplantation depends on (1) the conditioning regimen, (2) type of donor (HLA-matched vs -mismatched 
or unrelated), (3) Type  of GVHD prophylaxis.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_597934]  evaluated a com bination of fl udarabine and m elphalan as originally 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_466321].1 Using this regim en, we obtained approximately 30% 
disease-free surviva l, 30% tr eatment re lated m ortality and observ ed a high  incidence of extensive chronic GVHD.  Di sease free survival  was obtained in 
approximately 20-30% of the patients.
4 In a subsequent study, at the University of 
Chicago (IRB [ZIP_CODE] A), we have continued  to use the sam e condition ing 
 6 regimen, but em ployed Campath 1H (alem tuzumab), a T-cell depleting agent, 
instead of m ethotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis.5 This c onditioning results in  
excellent engraftment, much decreased toxicity, near absence of chronic GVHD and excellent initial survival. Unfortunate ly, recurrence rates ar e high in patients 
with advanced leukemia and lymphoma and long-term disease free survival in this 
patient group is likely to be in the range of 20% to 35%.
5-7 (and manuscript submitted) 
 Our experience indicates that treatment related mortality not only depends on the 
conditioning regimen, but also  depends on the toxicity of  the medications used for 
GVHD prophylaxis an d on the efficacy  of GVHD prevention. In deed, the 
fludarabine melphalan conditioning regimen has considerably more toxicity when tacrolimus and methotrexate are used fo r GVHD prophylaxis, than with the use of 
Campath and a short course of tacr olimus. Vice versa, tacrolimus and 
methotrexate are less efficient in preven ting GVHD than alemtuzumab. So more 
patients develop acute a nd chronic GVHD with tacrolim us-methotrexate. This 
also results in an increase in treatment related mortality.  
5.3 Busulfan for conditioning in transplant. 
To address the problem of delayed diseas e recurrence  after fludarabine-melphalan 
conditining and GVHD prophylaxis with al emtuzumab, we are interested in 
studying th e efficacy and treatm ent relate d mortality associated with a m ore 
intensive conditioning regimen, but similar alemtuzumab based GHVD prophylaxis regimen. 
 
Busulfan (1,4-bis-(methanesolfonoxyl) butane) is a bifunctional alkylating agent, which was first described by [CONTACT_466345].
8  Since the demonstration of its 
potent antitumor effects, it has been used extensively for the tr eatment of malignant 
disease, especially hematologic malignancies and myeloproliferative syndromes. Its use was for a long tim e limited to low dose or al therapy with pa lliative intent, and 
frequent monitoring of the blood counts was routinely recommended. The advent 
of some 2 t o 3% of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_466322]-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as 
well as occasionally severe, som etimes ev en irreversible myelosuppression after  
prolonged adm inistration effectively de terred dose escalation beyond 8-[ADDRESS_597935] commonly in combination 
with cyclophospham ide (Bu/CY), has pr oven to be an effective an tileukemic 
regimen when used in conjunction with autologous or allogeneic hem atopoietic 
stem cell support and is comparable in efficacy to TBI containing regimens.18 
 
 7 High-dose busulfan thera py has several advantag es for use in  m arrow 
ablation/pretransplant treatm ent.  Firs t, when using chemotherapy alone for 
conditioning of patients undergoing m arro w transplantation, one avoids the 
dependence on a radiation unit with, us ually, lim ited capacity to  delive r th e 
necessary treatment on a fixed schedule.  Second, a radiation-based regim en can 
only be delivered to patient s who have not been previo usly irradiated.  Many 
patients with lym phoma, Hodgkin’s dis ease and leukem ia have had extensive 
radiation previously for cont rol of locally agg ressive di sease in sites s uch as the 
mediastinum, neck, and CNS.  Additio nally r adiation as p art of  the  
pretransplantation conditioni ng regim en may cause irreve rsible and often fatal 
toxicity in s uch cases.  However, a m ajor ity of previously radiated patients can 
safely receive a busulfan-based regimen, pr ovided that the previous acute radiation 
toxicity (usually within the first 2-4 months after radiation therapy) has subsided.  Third, in selected p atients who suffer r ecurrent leukemia after allogeneic m arrow 
grafting, a second marrow transplant may still offer a chance for long-term disease control or even cure.
19 Due to su bclinical (irrever sible) toxicity, a TBI-based 
regimen can only be utilized once  in a patien t’s lifetime, whereas com bination chemotherapy can be e mployed following a previous TBI-based regim en.  Busulfan-based chemotherapy may, theref ore, serve as a valid alternative. 
 
5.3.1 Rationale for a Parenteral Formul ation of Busulfan in Marrow 
Transplantation 
 
Oral busulfan has, unfortunately, several serious shortcomings.  When used in 
high-dose combination regimens, serious si de effects in the liver and lungs are 
often encountered
10;20;[ADDRESS_597936] reported veno-occlusive 
disease (VOD) of the liver leading to fata l liver failure, as the m ost serious side 
effect.11;13;14;17.  Neurologic disturbances such as grand mal seizures, and severe 
nausea and  vom iting are also freq uently en countered.22-[ADDRESS_597937]-pass phenomenon.  Based on the limited information that is available regarding busulfan pharmacokinetics, it appears however that patients who absorb a large fraction of the inge sted dose, with a prolonged high busulfan 
plasma concentr ation, will b e a t incre a sed risk f or dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_466323] e 
effects.
14;17;26;27 Another disadvantage with oral busulfan is that patients who 
develop severe nausea and vomiting shortly (within one-half to two (1/2-2) hours) 
after a dose has b een delivered will lo se pa rt or all of the dos e, and it will be 
virtually impossible to accurately d etermine how much of the dose has been lo st in a vomiting subject.  Furthermore, the inte stinal resorption of any delivered drug 
may be influenced by [CONTACT_102]’s nutritional status, and by [CONTACT_466346], as well as 
by [CONTACT_466347] t has eaten  in cl ose proxim ity to ingestion of the 
administered drug dose and, finally, by [CONTACT_3433] e inherent biological variability in 
intestinal absorption between different patients. Due to these uncertain ties, oral administration of high-dose busulfan carries  with it an inherent safety problem 
 [ADDRESS_597938] of  suboptimal underdosing the patient with 
an inadvertently high potential for recurrent or persistent malignancy after the 
marrow transplant.   
 
Busulfan dissolved in DMA/PEG400/dext rose (Busulfex®)  has been recen tly 
approved for conditio ning in transplantation  and has replaced o ral busulfan  because of  its reliable dosing  and its m ore predictable intrapatient 
pharmacokinetics.  A multi-institutional tria l of IV Busulfan in combination with 
cyclophosphamide as pretransplant c onditioning therapy in patients with 
advanced hematologic malignancies indicated  that the  safety profile is grea tly 
improved when the busulfan is adm inistered  IV as com pared with the standard  
oral busulfan formulation.  In particular, the incidence of serious, lifethreatening 
or lethal veno-occlusive disease of the liv er was  reduced to <20% of what would 
be expected from using oral Busulf an in high- dose pretransplant conditioning therapy in patients with adva nced hematologic malignancies.
[ADDRESS_597939] after this 
regimen when the busulfan is given as a standardized dose based on PK parameters. These limited data sugges t an “optimal” dose-exposure (“area under 
the curve” AUC) for Busulfex, below a nd above which there is increased 
treatment failure.
[ADDRESS_597940].  They used 
once daily administration of both Fl udarabi ne (50 mg/m2) and IV Busulfan (3.2 
mg/kg BW) for four da ys in combinati on with cyclosporine-methotrexate based 
GVHD prophylaxis. The obtained safety info rmation indicated, that this regim en 
is well tolerated without unexpected side effects, and allowing for c onsistent 
engraftment and good antitum or effect.34 Further, they obtained lim ited 
pharmacokinetic (PK) infor mation, which support the previous notion that busulfan in this dosing interval displays  linear pharmacokinetics. A similar study 
was reported by [CONTACT_466348].
[ADDRESS_597941] lim ited cure rates in patien ts with advanc e hematologic m alignancies. There are considerable data suggesting a dose-
response curve for cure rates with busulfan conditioning in hem atologic 
malignancies.
29;[ADDRESS_597942] dose escalation to an AU C above 1500 m cgr.min/L.dose (when four 
divided doses were given) was associat ed with an unacceptab le increase in  
VOD.
14;17;36-[ADDRESS_597943]-dose followed by [CONTACT_466349] d AUC with subsequent doses.
27;40 IV Busulfex 
has  linear pharmacokinetics27;29;34;[ADDRESS_597944] dose of  0.5 mg/kg IV over [ADDRESS_597945] and fourth dose to confirm the r elationship between pr edicted and obtained AUC. The target 
starting daily AUC (4800 um ol-min) is s lightly lower tha nt the m edian AUC (4897 umol-min) observed in the MD A nderson study with a fixed dose of 130 
mg/kg.
35 One should however also take in to account th e additional one-tim e 
busulfan exposure (approxim ately 600 um ol-min) from  the test dose in our 
patients. Therefore, even at the starting target AUC, cum ulative busulfan exposure for our patients  at [ADDRESS_597946] outco mes are obtained with the use of 
syngeneic donors (i.e. identical twins). Grafts from  such donors are accepted 
without risk for graft failure or graft versus  host disease. 
Among siblings, the probability of being id entical for all majo r histocompatibility 
(HLA) antigens is approxi mately 25%. Allogeneic matched (HLA-identical) 
siblings can be identified for approxim a tely 20-30% of the population.  Seventy 
percent of patients who m ight otherwise benefit from alloge neic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation lack a suitably  matched related donor.  Alternative donor 
sources include partially m atched rela ted donors, unrelated  volunteers, and 
previously banked placental blood. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466324] s tudies. As in our previous studies, we will use m o lecular typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (DNA sequencing ) of 10 
relevant HLA alleles (A, B, C, DR, DQ) for determining donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466325].

recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466326].   
Unfortunately the recu rrence ra te in pa tients with  ad vanced he matologic malignancies was high.  In the current study w e continue to use cam path GVHD prophylaxis because of its excellent tole rance and efficacy. We propose to combine 
it with a  f ludarabine busulf an condition ing regim en and individua lized pharmacokinetics based dosing. We hypothe size that intensif ication of the 
 11conditioning regimen will result in impr oved disease control. We hypothesize that 
AUC based dosing will lim it toxicity and that furth er d ose es calation of this  
regimen will be possible.  Th e phase I portion of this study will enroll patients with 
a variety of hematologic malignancies. Howe ver, we anticipate that, as in previous 
studies, approximately 50% of our patients will have AML and MDS. The phase II 
portion of this study will be lim ited to pa tients with advanced AML and MDS, a 
patient population where we have previous ly observed a poor outcom e.  Patients 
with other disease stages or histologies will then be entered on other protocols. 
5.[ADDRESS_597948] of busulfan is through sulfonation by [CONTACT_8618] a sulfur 
group from Glutathione through Gl utathione S-transferases (GST ), a process that occurs 
mainly in the liver. T hereafter, the liphoph ilic interm ediary undergoes oxidation by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 enzymes before excretion.[ADDRESS_597949]’s. The soluble GST’s in humans comprise at least 16 genes 
grouped in 8 classes and are the GS T’s involved in busulfan m etabolism.[ADDRESS_597950]’s are structurally unrelated to the soluble GST’s a nd of no relevance to 
busulfan metabolism.  At least eight subtypes of soluble GST have been described, each with specific affinities 
and more or less tissue restricted expressi on. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_466327] A1.
44  GSTM1 accounts for approximately 48%  of busulfan metabolism and a third 
GST, GSTP1 accounts for approximately 18%.45;[ADDRESS_597951] A1 which correlates closely w ith 
busulfan metabolizing potential.44;[ADDRESS_597952] six polym orphi c sites in the GSTA1 
promoter, and the existence of five different alleles.44;[ADDRESS_597953] toxicity of 
busulfan metabolites (perhaps due to r eciprocally in creased GS TA1 activity),[ADDRESS_597954] etion and cyclophospham ide 
toxicity. Confirmation of these res ults after conditioning with busulf an-fludarabine, is 
likely to provide important new information on this issue.  
5.7 Pharmacogenomic determinants of  drug efficacy: 
In addition to stud ies relating GST polym orphism  to toxicity, we will, in patients with 
leukemia, study leukemia blasts to determin e the relation between polymorphisms relating 
to busulfan and/or fludarabine metabolism a nd efficacy. For this purpose, we will study a 
sample of leukemia cells obtained from the bone marrow. Such samples will be obtained 
from AML patients participating in the phase I and or phase II porti on of the protocol.  
 Although resistance to fludarabine may occur
 by [CONTACT_97965], one proposed 
mechanism of cellular and clinical resistance is reduced intracellular drug 
accumulation53.  The early steps of plasma membrane transport, nucleoside 
phosphorylation, and nucleotide dephosphoryla tion determine intracellular 
accumulation of fludarabine and its metabolites. Fludarabine is administered as the 
5'-nucleotide monophosphate and is  converted to the nucleoside by [CONTACT_466350]-5'nucleotidase (CD73). As fludarabine is a hydrophilic 
compound and does not readily cross plasma membranes by [CONTACT_35774], the presence 
of functional nucleoside transporte rs that accept fludarabine as a permeant is 
required for cellular entry at rates sufficient to achieve cytotoxic levels of 
intracellular metabolites.  Three human (h) nucleoside transporter proteins, 
equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), equilibrative nucleoside transporter 
2 (hENT2), and concentrative nuc leoside transporter 3 (hCNT3), have been shown 
to mediate cellular entry of fludarabine54-56.  
Within the cell, fludarabine requires anabolism to the active 5'-triphosphate 
(fludarabine triphosphate)  to exert its cytotoxic effects. The rate-limiting step in this 
process is the conversion by [CONTACT_56614] (dCK) of free nucleoside to the 
5'-nucleotide monophosphate (Plunkett 91). Direc tly opposing dCK activity are the 
intracellular 5'-nucleotidases, including the high-K m 5'-nucleotidase (CN-II) and 
deoxynucleotidase-1 (dNT-1) (Galmarini 01).   
In order to identify molecular markers of potential predictive value in AML 
patients, we will evaluate AML patients who had not previously been treated with 
fludarabine to determine 1) the cellular expression of genes encoding nucleoside 
transporter proteins and enzymes mediating fludarabine metabolism, and 2) the role 
of polymorphisms in these genes. 
 
RNA will be extracted from leukemia cells in bone marrow specimens by [CONTACT_23133]-time PCR.  We w ill then analyze the relationships
 between RNA 
 13expression, germ line and somatic polymorphi sms in the gene described above, and 
time to disease progression following fludarabine therapy.  
 
Similarly, due to the role of GSTs in the inactivation of busulfan, we will evaluate 
1) the expression of GST genes in leukemi a cells, 2) its correlation with germ line 
and somatic GST polymorphisms, and 3) the correlation among GST expression, polymorphisms and time to disease progression.  
 
6.0 
BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION  
6.1 Tacrolimus (Prograf) 
    TACROLIMUS is a macrolide compound with potent immunosuppressant 
properties.                           
    DOSING INFORMATION:  TACROLI MUS is usually given intravenously 
initially in doses of 0.03 mg/kg/day for 3 days, followed by [CONTACT_466351] (0.09 mg/kg twice daily); dose ad justments are required in patients with 
hepatic dysfunction.                    HUMAN PHARMACOLOGY:  The oral absorption of TACROLIMUS iserratic and incomplete; absolute bioavailability is approximately 25%; peak serum levels 
are seen [ADDRESS_597955] 
ranged from 0.2 to 6 ng/mL;TACROLIMUS is extensively metabolized in the 
liver, with only small amounts of unchange d drug (2% or less) being recovered in 
the urine; the elimination half-life of TACROLIMUS is approximately 10 h.    
CAUTIONS:  Common adverse effect s of TACROLIMUS areheadache, 
hyperesthesia, tremors, circumoral numbness, insomnia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and appetite       insomnia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and appetite changes; all of these effects occur primarily with IV TACROLIMUS a nd are more frequent during combined 
use of TACROLIMUS and CYCLOSPORI NE; other adverse effects include 
nephrotoxicity, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, dysphasia, photophobia, flushing, and lymphopro liferative disorder; unlike 
CYCLOSPORINE, hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, and hypertension are 
generally not seen with TACROL IMUS; combined therapy with 
CYCLOSPORINE has resulted in increas es in cyclosporine serum levels and 
more severe nephrotoxicity.           
6.2 Busulfan  
 
BUSULFAN is an alkylating agent that interferes with DNA replication and 
transcription of RNA and ultimately resu lts in the disruption of nucleic acid 
function. DOSING INFORMATION:  In transplantati on, doses of 1 mg/kg PO are repeated 
to a usual cumulative dose of 16 mg/kg. The usual dose for IV Busulfan is 80% of 
the equivalent PO dose. 
 14HUMAN PHARMACOLOGY: Busulfan is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_466328], and measurable blood levels are obtained with in 0.5-2 hours 
after oral administration.  Within 3 minutes  after IV administra tion in rats, 90% of 
the drug disappears from the blood; similar rapid decreases in blood concentrations 
have been reported in man.  Busulfan is reported to be extensively metabolized; [ADDRESS_597956] not been identified.  The drug is 
slowly excreted in the urine, chiefly as methanesulfonic acid.  Ten to 50% of a dose 
is excreted as metabolites within 24 hours. CAUTIONS : Dose limiting toxicity is hematological.  Long term therapy has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis and an  Addison's like syndrome. Seizures have 
been reported after high dose Busulfan used  for transplantation. Dilantin is often 
administered preventively.  
6.3 Fludarabine 
 Fludarabine is the 2-fl uoro, 5-phosphate de rivative of vidarabine.     
DOSING INFORMATION:  Doses of 25 mg /m(2)/day (30-minute infusion) for 5 
days every 4 weeks has been effective previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a loading dose of 20 mg/m(2) intravenously followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 30 mg/m(2)/24 
hours for 48 hours, has been effective; dos e reductions are su ggested in renal 
insufficiency. 
PHARMACOKINETICS:  Following intr avenous administration, fludarabine 
phosphate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_267107] 2-fluoro-vidarabine, which subsequently 
enters tumor cells and is phosphorylated to the active triphosphate  derivative; peak 
plasma levels of 2-fluoro-vidarabine  have ranged from 0.3 to 0.9 mcg/mL 
following a short infusion of 25 mg/m(2) fludarabine; 24% of a dose of fludarabine 
is recovered in the urine as 2-fluoro-vi darabine; the elimination half-life of 
2-fluoro-vidarabine is 9 hours. 
CAUTIONS:  Myelosuppression, particular ly neutropenia, is the predominant 
adverse effect; a severe neurotoxicity has been observed, mainly with higher doses; 
other adverse effects include nausea, vom iting, diarrhea, stomatitis, skin rash, and 
somnolence; pneumonitis has been reported in 1 patient.        
CLINICAL APPLICATIONS:  Intravenous fludarabine has been highly effective 
in heavily pretreated patien ts with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; the drug has also 
produced responses in patients with non- Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute leukemia; 
however, neurotoxicity has been a major concern, even with low doses, and more 
studies are needed to clar ify its ultimate place in therapy.           
6.4 CAMPATH- 1H (Alemtuzumab) 
CAMPATH-1H is a humanized monoclona l antibody directed against CD52, an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_267108] T- and B- lymphocytes, but not on NK 
cells. It has been extensively used for the prevention of GVHD both in vitro and 
in vivo. 
DOSING INFORMATION:  In transplantati on, daily doses of 20 mg are repeated 
for up to five times. 
 15HUMAN PHARMACOLOGY:  Campath is extensively bound to circulating 
CD52 in the serum as well as present in  unbound form. The half life of Campath 
is prolonged and free Campath can be detected for several weeks after 
administration. Campath is usually admini stered intravenously, but recent data 
indicate that subcutaneous administration is associated with a decreased incidence of severe reactions. In some studies Camp ath has been admixed with the stem cell 
infusate. 
CAUTIONS: The infusion of Campath H1 has been associated with fever,nausea, 
headache, vomiting, rash, chills a nd rigor. Occasionall y hypotension and 
bronchospasm have been reported. This can be managed by [CONTACT_267129].

Comments: Busulfan administration has been associat ed with a low incidence of seizures and 
dilantin is routinely used for seizure prophylaxis. Dilantin use is discouraged in this protocol because exposure to dilantin  can affect Busulfan metabolism.

We recommend benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] e.g clon azepam (klonopin ®) 1 mg PO TID 
Scheduling:  
Busulfan test dose: 
The test dose can be scheduled any day within [ADDRESS_597959]-dose will be based on actual body weight and will be accompanied by [CONTACT_466353]. This dose will be given as an outpatient. Patients will be admitted in the evening of day –8, to start fludarabine on day -7  
 
Fludarabine: 
Fludarabine dosing will be based on actual body weight. Flud arabine will be infused over 
30 minutes before busulfan treatment dose. 
 
Busulfan treatment doses: 
 
On each day of treatment, busulfan will be administered through a fresh infusion line at a steady rate over 3 hours. Infusion will start in the morn ing around 5 AM and will be 
completed around 8 AM, allowing ample time for pharmacokinetic sampling in the afternoon.  *Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed on the day 1 dose and again on the day 4 dose. For logistical reas ons (week-end, holidays), day 3 pharmacokinetics may be 
performed instead of day 4. Busulfan doses may be further adjusted based on levels 
obtained with treatment dose 1.  
 
 18Campath 
All patients will receive prem edication for Campath as per current standards at the UC 
transplant unit. 
 
9.1.3 Dose schedule (see also statistical plan)  
The targeted daily AUC of busulfan will be determing using the modified continual 
reassessment method.   Target AUC’s are the following: Dose level 0 : 4800 mcgr.min/L.dose  
Dose level 1 : 5800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 2 : 6800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 3 : 7800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 4 : 8800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 5 : 9800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
 We do not anticipate further dose-escalation beyond dose level 5. If such dose-escalation 
were to be considered, we would subm it an amended protocol to the IRB. 
  
9.1.4 Bone marrow/stem cel infusion 
On day [ADDRESS_597960] will be infused according to BMT unit policy. Bone marrow, PBSC will not be furthe r processed except in the case of ABO-
incompatibility. In such instances, red bl ood cells will be removed from bone marrow 
products or from PBSC products containing excessive amounts of RBC (as per transplant policy). 
All stem cell products procured through the NMDP will be done so in strict compliance 
with the protocols, policies, and pr ocedures established by [CONTACT_267122].  
   
9.1.5 GVHD prophylaxis  
 Tacrolimus 0.03 mg/kg/day IV CI over 24 hr from 4 PM day -2 until engraftment or 
when patient is able to take PO, then t acrolimus 0.09 mg/kg PO in 2 divided doses.  
Tacrolimus should be given at full dose to  maintain levels of 5-15 ng/mL through day 
100. Thereafter tacrolimus will be tapered by 20% every week unless the patient has 
developed GVHD. In recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466329], tacrolimus 
will be continued until day 180. Thereafter t acrolimus will be tapered by 20% every week 
unless the patient has developed GVHD. 
 
9.1.6 Supportive care:  
Infection prophylaxis and supportive care will be as BMT unit policy.  No routine growt factor support will be admini stered. Growth factor support w ill be considered in case of 
delayed engraftment (ANC < 0.5x10
9/L on day 12) 
 
 199.1.[ADDRESS_597961] (only for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466330]) 
For patients transplanted in remission, a backup bone marrow or peripheral blood stem 
cell collection will be consider ed within two weeks prior to  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466331] 30%. All backup harvests will be 
cryopreserved after processing for buffy co at without any further manipulation. The 
backup stem cells will be given if deemed clinically necessary in the event of failure to engraft by [CONTACT_4475] +35, graft rejection after day +35, or graft fa ilure after day +35. 
  
10.[ADDRESS_597962] ical reasons, sampling on day 4 is not possible, then day 
3 may be used as the time point for the second sample. Samples will be taken from a peripheral vein (through the same line after additional flushing) into prechilled heparin tubes with plasma separation within [ADDRESS_597963] times when the blood levels are drawn. Plasma will be separated by  [CONTACT_128934] 2500 
rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C within 1 hour, plac ed in cryogenic vials, and analyzed or 
stored at -40°C until analyzed by a validated high-pressure chromatography in the Pharmacokinetics core lab at the Univ ersity of Chicago Cancer Center. 
10.1 Timing of samples:  
10.1.[ADDRESS_597964] dose: 
Blood samples (5 mL) will be taken before Bu infusion, at 175 minutes (five minutes before completion), 240 minutes (1 hour after completion) 300 minutes (  2 hours after completion), 360 minutes (3  hours after completion) and  420 
minutes (4 hours after comple tion) of the test dose  
10.1.2 Treatment doses 1 and 3 (or 4): 
Blood samples (5 mL) will be taken before Bu infusion, at 175 minutes (five minutes before completion), 240 minutes (1 hour after completion) 300 minutes (  2 hours after completion), 360 minutes (3 hours after completion of the treatment 
dose 1 (day -6) and treatment dose 4 (day -3) (or in selected patients, treatment 
dose 3, day –2)  The Software program WinNonLin Pro ® will be used for calculating AUC.

 2713.[ADDRESS_597969] will not be taken into accoun t for the definition of clinical recurrence. 
The diagnosis of disease recurrence will be ba sed on clinical and pathological criteria. 
 
Toxicity will be scored a ccording to NCI/CTC version 3 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov /reporting/ctc.html ). Any grade 5 (fatal) toxi city will be considered 
a DLT. In addition grade 4 toxicities will be  considered DLT with the exception of the 
following: Grade 4 hematologic toxicities will not  be DLT. Grade 4 infections will not be 
DLT. Any grade 4 toxicity that can be attribut ed to infection will not be considered DLT. 
 To assess severity of GVHD we will use th e Seattle criteria (Bearman et al, Blood 85, 
2005, 1995). In this system, mild VOD is clinically obvious, but does not require 
treatment and resolves completely. Moderate VOD requires treatment such as diuretics or 
pain medications, but resolves completel y. Severe VOD requires treatment and does not 
resolve completely. Severe VOD will be considered DLT.   Acute GVHD will be scored according to the criteria proposed by [CONTACT_267135][INVESTIGATOR_20360].
58 
Chronic GVHD will be scored according to  appendix C. Limited Chronic GVHD is 
defined as GVHD with limited skin involvement  only or presenting with liver function 
abnormalities only. All other presentations of  chronic GVHD are defined as extensive 
and will require treatment.  High risk extensive chronic GVHD is characte rized by [CONTACT_466361] 
(<100,000/mm3).
59 
   
The diagnosis of Veno-occlusive disease will be based on Baltimore criteria as follows: 
development of hyperbilirubinemia with seru m bilirubin >2mg/dl w ith any two of the 
following symptoms: ascites, painful hepato megaly and unexplained weight gain >5% 
from baseline within 20 days of BMT. When ever possible, a presumed diagnosis of VOD 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_145139].
60 
 
Engraftment will be defined as per IBMTR and NMDP guidelines. Cytogenetic and chimerism studies will be perfor med to confirm donor origin. 
  
Failure to engraft will be defined as lack of  evidence of hematopoietic recovery (ANC < 
500/mm
3 and platelet count < 20,000/mm3 ) by [CONTACT_4475] +35, confirmed by a biopsy revealing 
a marrow cellularity < 5%. Graft failure will be defined as initial myeloid engraftment by 
[CONTACT_4475] +35, documented to be of donor origin, followed by a drop in the ANC to < 500/mm3 
for more than three days, independent of  any myelosuppressive drugs, severe GVHD, 
CMV, or other infection.  
 
 28Graft rejection will be defined as graft failure with documentation of return of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466338]/or chimerism studies.

(CRM) to determ ine the m aximum tolerated dose (Faries, 1994; Goodm an et al., 1995)61;62. Dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) will b e as defined und er 13.[ADDRESS_597971] 21 days  after 
transplant.  Dose cohorts of size th ree will be u tilized and we will targ et the 25th percentile of the 
tolerance distribution, i.e ., the dose level producing DLT in 25% of  the patient population.  Briefly, the 
modified-CRM design utilizes a on e-parameter, logistic regression model for the dose-toxicity curve

where ) (x p is the probability of DLT at dose level .x A prior distribution is assumed for the parameter
and the first three patients are assigned to the lo west dose level.  After outcomes are observed for  
these patients, the posterior distribution for  is calculated and the estim ate d toxicity probabilities are 
updated.  The next cohort of patients  are assigned to the dose level cl osest to the targeted percentile, 
with the restriction that doses can not be esca lated more that one le vel at a tim e.  Enrollm ent is 
continued until a pre-determined total number of patients have been stu died, whereupon the MTD is  
derived based on the final, esti mated dose-toxicity curve.   
 
In our trial, the first cohort of three patients will be enrolled at dose level [ADDRESS_597972] been followed to 60 days before the next eligible patient becom es available.  In 
this case we will assig n such patients ( termed excess patients) to th e current dose level; once the 
original three patients pass the 60-day landmark, we  will update the prediction probabilities using all 
available data.  However, so as not to bias the procedure, if excess patients have not been followed for a 
full 60 days, we will not include their toxicity outcomes in the updated analysis , even if a D LT has 
been observed.  A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the phase I trial.   
 Because delayed VOD ( day 30 and day 60) of moderate  severity has been obser ved in two of the 12 
initial patients on study, the observation perio d for su ccessive patients will be extended to 6 0 days 
before dose escalation. This will lead to accru al of a higher num ber of patients per dose level and 
therefore we anticipate up to 50 patients in the phase I trial.  Addendum June 2006: Pharmacokinetics for the initia l [ADDRESS_597973] been introduced. Therefore accrual will res ume at 
dose level 0. This will result in accrual of an additional 20 patients to the protocol. 
 
 
 Phase II 
 
The primary endpoint for the phase II portion of the trial is the disease- free survival rate (DFS) at one 
year defined as the proportion of patients alive and without evidence of recurrence one year after the 
initiation of therapy.  All patients will be followed for a minimum of one year and we will test the null 
hypothesis that the DFS rate at twelve months is <  25% versus the alternative that it is at least 40%.  A 
Simon (1989), optimal two-stage design will be employe d in which [ADDRESS_597974] 
stage.63 (Patients treated at the MT D during the phase I portion of the study will be included in the 
phase II trial.)  If the number alive and without evidence of recurrence at  twelve months is [ADDRESS_597975] to the monitoring described below 
for graft failure, liver toxicity, and GVHD, an additio nal 43 patients will be enrolled for a total of 72.  If 
22 or fewer patients are diseas e free at 12 months the regimen will be  rejected, whereas if  23 or more of 
the total 72 patients (>  32%) are disease free, the regim en w ill be considered worthy of further 
evaluation in phase III trials.  This design has an - level of 10% and a power of 90% under the 
alternative hypothesis that the true 12-m onth DFS rate is 40%.   The probability of early term ination 
when the 12-month DFS rate is 25% is 0.56.  However,  to avoid a long suspensi on of the trial, accrual 
will continue into the second stage while the one-ye ar outcomes in the [ADDRESS_597976] stage patients are being 
accumulated.   
  In addition, the incidence of graf t failure, liver toxicity, and high- risk, extensive chronic GVHD at 18 
months will be closely monitore d and evaluated.  For the prim ary endpoint of DFS, we will employ a  
Simon (1989) two-stage design. Graft failure, liver toxicity, and GVHD will be monitored at specified intervals as  descr ibed below.  An independe nt Data an d Saf ety M onitoring C ommittee will be  established to review the data and make recomme ndations regarding the con tinuation or discontinuation 
of the tr ial.
 This comm ittee is organized by  [CONTACT_466362] (High risk pr otocol 
monitoring committee)  Since the assumptions regarding efficacy and toxicity are the  same, the related 
donor and unrelated donor subgroups will be combined for all analyses.    
   Adverse Event Monitoring 
 
Graft failure and liver toxicity will be monitored and early termination of the trial will be considered if 
there is evidence that the graft failure rate is >10% or the rate of liver toxicity is >15%.  Specifically, for graft failure the data will be reviewed after su ccessive cohorts of [ADDRESS_597977] 10, 20, and 30patients with 
successful engraftment and without evidence of  re lapse reach their 18-month landm ark.  (By [CONTACT_29623] 
[ADDRESS_597978] sure ly been accrued.)  Evidence that 
the rate of high-risk, extensive GVHD is >40% will lead to cons ideration for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   
Specifically, if [ADDRESS_597979] 20, or 17 of 30 such patients develop GVHD at any time 
 30prior to 18 months we will cons id er terminating the trial.  Each  of these th ree stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_466339] a Pocock (1977)64 group sequential m onitoring boundary for a one-sided, overall alpha  
level of 0.10.   
 
    Additional  Statistical Analyses 
 
At the conclusion of the phase II tr ial, 90% confidence intervals will be generated for the DFS rate at 
12 months, as well as for the incidence of graft failure, and the incidence of active and extensive 
GVHD.  Kaplan-Meier (1958) estimate s of disease-free and overall surv ival rates will be calculated,65 
and the median disease-free and overall survival ti mes and their as sociated 90% confidence intervals 
derived using the method given in Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982).66 Descriptive statistics related to 
the frequency of adverse events, including liver toxici ty, and of changes in laboratory values will be generated. Association between GS TA1 enzymatic activity and busulfa n metabolic rate (i.e. AUC, T
1/2) 
will be determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient or , in case of a m onotone but non-linear 
relationship, by [CONTACT_466363]’s rank correlation  coeffici ent.  To account for other determ inants of 
metabolism, m ultiple linear regre ssion ana lysis will also  be perf ormed.  The relation  b etween enzymatic activity and incidence of VOD will be asse ssing using logistic regression analysis.  Multiple 
logistic regression analysis may be atte mpted, depending on the frequency of VOD.  
  The relationship between GST polymorphisms and VOD will be analyzed using chi-square or 
Fisher’s exact test. The association between polymorphisms and busulfa n pharmacokinetics will 
be analyzed using a t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate.   Finally, 
the pharmacogenomic determinants of drug efficacy will be assess using Cox (1972) 
multivariable regression analysis
67 with time to disease progression or death as the outcome 
variable and genotype and busulfan pharmacokine tic parameters (AUC, etc.) as predictor 
variables.   
 
Estimated duration of accrual  
For the ph ase I tr ial, we estimate approximately 4-[ADDRESS_597980]. 
16.2 Clinical progression. Such patients may be  treated on other treatment protocols or 
at the investigator’s disc retion. Such patients will con tinue to be monitored for 
survival and, may be asked to continue  to provide specimens for studies of 
minimal residual disease and immune r econstitution as other treatments are 
recommended. 
 
17.0 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 Any unexpected life-threatening an d serious (grade 3 or 4) toxi city will be reported immediately 
to the Study Chairman.  The Chairman will be  responsible for notif ying the Surveillance 
Committee.  
Expected toxicities are thos e listed in the consent form  and include regimen-related 
toxicities, myelosuppression, opportunistic infe ctions such as CMV reactivation, or GVHD. 
These will not be routinely reported to the IRB even if they require admission.  
 
On the other hand, such toxicities will be mon itored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_466340]. 
 All deaths that are not due to disease recurrence will be reported to the IRB.

Comments: Busulfan administration has been associated with a low incidence of seizures and dilantin is routinely used for seizure prophylaxis. Dilantin  use is discouraged in this protocol because 
exposure to dilantin can affect Busulfan metabolism.

We recommend benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] e.g clon azepam (klonopin ®) 1 mg PO TID 
Scheduling:  
Busulfan test dose: 
The test dose can be scheduled any day within [ADDRESS_597985]-dose will be based on actual body weight and will be accompanied by [CONTACT_466364]. This dose will be given as an outpatient. Patients will be admitted in the evening of day –8, to start fludarabine on day -7  
 
Fludarabine: 
Fludarabine dosing will be ba sed on actual body weight. Fludarabine will be infused over 30 
minutes before busulfan treatment dose. 
 
Busulfan treatment doses: 
 
On each day of treatment, busulfan will be admini stered through a fresh infusion line at a steady 
rate over 3 hours. Infusion will start in the morning around 8 AM and will be completed around  
11 AM, allowing ample time for pharmacoki netic sampling in the afternoon.  
*Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed on the day 1 dose and again on the day 4 dose. For logistical reasons (week-end, holidays), day 3 ph armacokinetics may be performed instead of 
day 4.  
 
 38Campath 
All patients will receive premedi cation for Campath as per current standards at the UC transplant 
unit. 
18.1.1 Dose escalation schedule (see also statistical plan)  
The targed AUC of busulfan will be escalated and de-escalated in an up and down design to 
achieve a dose where less than [ADDRESS_597986] a DLT.  
 Target AUC’s are the following: Dose level 0 : 4800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 1 : 5800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 2 : 6800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 3 : 7800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 4 : 8800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
Dose level 5 : 9800 mcgr.min/L.dose 
 We do not anticipate further dose-escalation beyond dose level 5. If such dose-escalation were to 
be considered, we would resubmit an  amended protocol to the IRB. 
 
18.1.2 Bone marrow/stem cel infusion 
On day [ADDRESS_597987] will be infused according to BMT unit policy. Bone marrow, PBSC will not be further processe d except in the case of ABO-incompatibility. In 
such instances, red blood cells will be rem oved from bone marrow products or from PBSC 
products containing excessive amounts of RBC (as per transplant policy). 
All stem cell products procured through the NMDP will be done so in strict compliance with the protocols, policies, and procedur es established by [CONTACT_267122].  
 
  
18.1.3 GVHD prophylaxis  
 Tacrolimus 0.03 mg/kg/day IV CI over 24 hr fr om 4 PM day -2 until engraftment or when 
patient is able to take PO, then tacrolimus 0.09 mg/kg PO in 2 divided doses.  Tacrolimus should 
be given at full dose to maintain levels of  5-15 ng/mL through day 100. Thereafter tacrolimus 
will be tapered by 20% every week un less the patient has developed GVHD. 
 
18.1.4 Supportive care:  
Infection prophylaxis and supportive care will be as BMT unit policy.  No routine growth factor 
support will be administered.Gro wth factor support will be co nsidered in case of delayed 
engraftment (ANC < 0.5x10
9/L on day 12) 
 
18.1.[ADDRESS_597988] (only for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_466342]) 
For patients transpla nted in remission, a backup bone ma rrow or peripheral blood stem cell 
collection will be considered within two weeks pr ior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466343] 30%. All backup harvests will be cryopreserved after processing for buffy coat without any further ma nipulation. The backup stem cells will be given 
if deemed clinically necessary in the event of fa ilure to engraft by [CONTACT_4475] +3 5, graft rejection after 
day +35, or graft failure after day +35.

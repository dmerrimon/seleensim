2.1  Study Rationale  
Traditional specimen collection techniques used in conjunction with respi[INVESTIGATOR_255462], for examples nasopharyngeal (NP) swabbing or 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], are often uncomfortable for the patient. Anterior nasal (AN) swab 
samples have provided a more comfortable sampling al ternative to NP swabs that 
is also less technically challenging. With ease of use and convenience for OTC 
home specimen collection with the Rapid SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_310337] s. The acceptance criteria for this study is Positive 
Percent Agreement (PPA) greater than or equal to eighty  percent and Negative

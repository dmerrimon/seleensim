Study Title:  A Phase 1/2a, Randomized, Double -Masked, Vehicle -Controlled Study 
Evaluating the Safety and Exploratory Activity of Two Concentrations (0.1% 
and 0.4%) of ALY688 Ophthalmic Solution in Subjects with Dry Eye Disease  
Study Number:  ALY688 -201 
Study Phase:  1/2a 
Study Objectives:  Primary objective: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 concentrations of 
ALY688  in subjects with dry eye disease  (DED) treated topi[INVESTIGATOR_144426]  
(BID)  for 8 weeks . 
Additional objective:  Evaluate the efficacy of 2 concentrations of ALY688  in 
subjects with DED  treated BID for 8 weeks . 
Study Design:  After meeting eligibility criteria during screening, qualified subjects will 
undergo a 14 -day run -in period during which they will use Vehicle BID 
bilaterally. If they meet eligibility criteria at baseline, they will be randomized 
1:1:1 to receive ALY688 0.1% (n=40), ALY688 0.4% (n=40) , or Vehicle 
(n=40). Dosing will be BID bilaterally . If there are no clinically significant 
drug-related adverse tolerability changes on Day 3, subjects will continue 
dosing BID bilaterally  for the remaining dosing period for a total of [ADDRESS_164352]  an 
inferior corneal fluorescein staining score (ICSS) ≥2, the study eye will be the 
one with the greater ICSS . If both eyes have the same ICSS grade, the eye 
with the higher overall total corneal staining score will be selected. If both 
eyes show the same total corneal staining score, the eye with the lower tear 
volume by [CONTACT_80688]’s test will be selected; if both eyes still score equally, the 
right eye will be selected.  
Ocular assessments should be conducted by [CONTACT_144437] a 
subject’s partici pation period to reduce observer variability. All efficacy 
assessments will be carried out consistent ly either in the morning or the 
afternoon (preferred time window is ±2 hours) throughout all study visits to 
minimize intra-subject diurnal variability.  
During the Baseline visit, all assessment s will be carried out before  dosing 
with the study medication in order to serve as pre -study baseline. For on -
treatment visits at W eeks 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_164353] 1 hour after recei ving study medication. At W eeks 2, 4, and 8, subjects 
who arrive in clinic before 1 pm should receive their morning dose 
administered by [CONTACT_96937]. Subjects who arrive in clinic after 1  pm should 
self-administer their morning dose and receive their afte rnoon/evening dose by 
[CONTACT_96937].  
A subset of subjects (up to 36) at selected sites will undergo blood collection 
for pharmacokinetic evaluation of the test article  at 3 timepoints (15 and 45 
minutes and 3 h ours) after final dose  of study medication at Week [ADDRESS_164354], Dose

any changes from baseline in slit lamp biomicroscopy , dilated fundus exam , 
visual acuity, IOP, and post -dosing comfort) and systemic evaluation s (AEs, 
BP and HR, clinical laborator y test results , and pharmacokinetic results [in a 
subset of subjects ]) in subjects with DED . 
Efficacy Endpoints:  To evaluate the efficacy of ALY688 compared with Vehicle by [CONTACT_144442]:  
•Mean change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in total corneal
fluorescein staining score using the NEI/Industry Workshop scale (0 -
20 scale ).
•Mean change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in EDS using a VAS
(0-100 scale, both eyes ) during the visit .
NOTE: This will also be assessed  by a daily EDS score card for the
7-day period prior to baseline and the Week s 2, 4, and 8 visits. The
mean of the se scores for the 7 days prior to the Week s 2, 4, and 8
visits will be compared with the mean of the scores for the 7 days
prior to baseline .
Additional exploratory endpoints:  
•Mean change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in ICSS (0-4 scale )
using t he Expanded NEI/Industry Workshop scale  (5 zones with 0 -4
scale/zone)
•Mean change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in ODS using a
VAS (0 -100 scale, both eyes )
oNOTE: This will be assessed in the same manner and at the
same timepoints as the EDS score
•Mean change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in SAnDE score
(frequency and severity) based upon subject recollection for the week
prior to visit
•Mean change from baseline at Weeks 2, 4, and 8 in conjunctival
lissamine green staining score using the NEI/Industry Workshop
scale (6  zones with 0 -4 scale/zone)

of the VAS  dry eye symptom index: 1) burning/stinging, 2) itching,
3) foreign body sensation, 4) photophobia, and  5) pain. In addition,
Confidential  the symptom that each subject self -identifies at baseline as the most 
bothersome will be analyzed separately.

by [CONTACT_144444] (IReST) in subjec ts with
adequate near visual acuity (BCVA of 20/40 or better) and
appropriate language  comprehension

oNOTE: Selected measures from those listed above will also

evaluations
Analysis Populations:  Safety and mITT populations: All randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_164364]  
Per protocol population: All randomized subjects who meet enrollment criteria 
and complete efficacy evaluations at week 4 or 8  
Sample Size and Statistical 
Methods:  This is an exploratory, hypothesis -generating study. However, with 40 
subjects per group  (N=120),  there is 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_164365] at an alpha level of 0.05 (uncorrected for 
multiplicity).  
A repeated measures analysis will be performed using the Wei -Lachin 
approach. I n addition to repeated measures, the Week 8 change from baseline 
will be tested as a single timepoint measure . An aggregated efficacy measure 
(specific endpoints TBD) will be analyzed as a means to look for consistent 
trends and to increase the overall power. F or example, an aggregate of ICSS, 
TFBUT, and Schirmer ’s test results may be analyzed . 
The test of the several endpoints involves a comparison of mean change from 
baseline across v isits. A fixed effects longitudinal model will be utilized where 
the data of both eyes will be used for measures evaluated in  both eyes with 
measures repeated across visits. Baseline score will be a covariate in the 
model. An unstructured correlation matri x will be utilized for correlation 
between eyes and across visits. Measures that do not involve both eyes will 
utilize an unstructured matrix to model the correlation across visits.  
The randomization will be stratified on study site to achieve a balance am ong 
treatment groups within a site. Each site will be preloaded with complete 
blocks. The site will dispense kit s by [CONTACT_144445]. To the extent possible, study drug  
resupply to sites will be  done with  complete block (s). 
Statistical details will be specified more fully in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

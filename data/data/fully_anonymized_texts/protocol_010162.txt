  Version Date: 08/16/16 SCHEMA 
 
Treatment Plan: 
Pre-treatment Period 
Screening assessments will be performed as described below:  
 
Days -21 to-1: (within 21 days prior to start of treatment). Informed consent; medical history; 
physical exam (PE) with vital signs, including height and weight; ECOG performance status and 
review of concomitant medications and electrocardiogram (EKG) will be ordered. Tumor tissue 
from a previous paraffin block will be obtained for correlative studies. 
  
Days -14 to -1: (within 14 days of start of treatment). PE with vital signs and weight; review of 
any new events in medical history and medication; ECOG performance status will be repeated. 
Assessment and tumor imaging (CT scans and optional PET/CT scans) will also be obtained.  
 
Day -7 to day 1 prior to study drug start: Hematology, comprehensive metabolic chemistry 
profile, coagulation profile and urinalysis will be obtained. Women of childbearing potential will 
have a serum pregnancy test done. 
 
Treatment Period :  
Vorinostat will be administered orally once daily continuously at [ADDRESS_902842] of 4 weeks of daily treatment.  
 
Study visits will be conducted on weeks 2 and 4 (±1 day) for the first cycle, then for the second 
cycle on week 5 and 7, (±1 day); then from week 9 on, every four weeks (±1 day) thereafter for 
the remainder of the study. Patient medical histories, physical examinations, laboratory tests, 
assessments of compliance with study medication and recording of adverse events will be 
conducted during study visits. Further blood may be drawn for research correlatives. For patients 
that have been on study longer than 2 years, office visits can be done every 12 weeks (±7 days), 
with medical history, concurrent meds, physical exam, vital signs, weight, performance status, 
and adverse events evaluation done also at that time. For patients that have been on study longer 
than 2 years, hematology labs and serum chemistry can be done every 6 weeks (±7 days).  
 
 
The severity duration and relationship to vorinostat will be determined for each adverse 
experience (AE) ( Section 11 ). 
 
Blood will be drawn on days [ADDRESS_902843] drug intake, and on days 7 (+- 1 day) and 28 (+-
1day), prior to drug intake, to assess for correlative studies.  
 
Patients will have radiological tumor assessment by [CONTACT_20420] (CT) scan (or 
magnetic resonance imaging - MRI) on days -14 to -1 (prior to the start of vorinostat) and day 56 
(±3 days). They will be followed with CT scans or MRI every 2 cycles / 8 weeks (± 1 week)  
thereafter. Patients may receive scans every 3 cycles/12 weeks (± 1 week)  after completing [ADDRESS_902844] 
tumor measurements (CT scans or MRI) done every 24 weeks (±10 days).  
8  NCI Protocol # 8474
  Local Protocol # 2009-165
  Version Date: 08/16/16  
Predicated on obtaining funding, additional scans (optional) will be performed.  These will 
include PET/CT scans prior to treatment, Day 28 (±3 days), and Day 56 (±3 days).  An 
additional CT scan or MRI will also be performed on Day 28 (±3 days) for comparison purposes. 
The Day 28 CT/MRI and the PET/CT scans will be optional studies- due to financial issues 
(funding). 
 
Vorinostat will be withheld for any possible or probable drug related grade [ADDRESS_902845] 2 dose reductions (from 300mg/day D1-7 to 300mg/day D1-5) 
due to grade 3 nausea, emesis or diarrhea (not controlled by [CONTACT_668532]); due to other drug-related grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity; due to grade 3/4 
neutropenia associated with fever and/or grade 4 neutropenia and/or grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
(section 6 ). In the event a patient is experiencing clinical b enefit from vorinostat and requires 
further dose reduction, a discussion between CTEP and PI [INVESTIGATOR_668488]. 
 
Patients who cannot be retreated within 3 weeks (21 days) of the end of the previous cycle 
should be removed from study, unless they are deriving benefit. In the later case, a discussion 
with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or CTEP senior investigator will also ensue. 
 
Patients who experience either stable disease, complete response, or partial response by [CONTACT_668533]/life-threatening side effects. 
 
Post-treatment Period: 
Patients with progression of disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or uncontrolled intercurrent 
illness will be taken off the trial. Other criteria for discontinuation will include: patient 
withdrawal of consent, noncompliance with study medication or visits, or any change that would 
render the patient ineligible for further treatment. In those cases, patients will be entered on the 
post-treatment period. The end of study visit should occur within [ADDRESS_902846] dose of the 
study drug or until death (if before 180 days). 
 
Correlative Studies: 
The correlative portion of this trial is described the Laboratory Correlates section ( appendix D ). 
In a retrospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], CT and or MRI scans already obtained from all the patients in the 
trial will be re-reviewed. RECIST imaging will be compared to volumetric density (viable tumor 
volume VTV) CT and MR measurements. The objective is to establish whether volumetric 
density/percent necrosis algorithms such as VTV more accurately assess the extent of the disease 
and response to therapy than standard RECIST criteria.

 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1
.1.  Primary Objectives  
• To evaluate the efficacy by [CONTACT_668534] (based on RECIST 1.1 
criteria) of vorinostat in the treatment of patients with locally advanced, 
recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic  carcinoma (ACC). 
 
     1.2 Secondary Objectives 
• To characterize the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in this patient 
population. 
• To assess the time to tumor response (TTR). 
• To assess the response duration (RD). 
• To evaluate progression free survival (PFS). 
• To assess overall survival (OS). 
 
1.3 Exploratory Objectives 
• To assess the association between a metabolic response by [CONTACT_10052]/CT after one 
cycle of chemotherapy and subsequent best tumor response according to 
standard anatomic response evaluation criteria (RECIST). 
• To assess the association between a metabolic response by [CONTACT_10052]/CT after the 
first and second chemotherapy cycle and PFS. 
• Flow sort diploid, aneuploid, and tetraploid populations of tumor cells from 
FFPE tissue blocks from patients who benefited from SAHA therapy and from 
patients who did not demonstrate a durable benefit.  
• Profile the genomes of each cell population using oligonucleotide CGH 
arrays. This will confirm the identification of tumor populations in each 
sample and provide genomic landmarks for NGS analysis.  
• Perform whole exome analysis of the sorted tumor population and matching 
germ line sample for each of the patients selected 
• To assess stable disease duration (SDD)  
• To assess the association between response to vorinostat treatment and 
HR23B on tumor paraffin blocks 
• Retrospectively compare volumetric density (viable tumor volume=VTV) 
with pre-determined RECIST of target lesions in cross sectioning imaging 
(CT/MR) already obtained 
• Correlate VTV, RECIST and treatment response (partial response, stable 
disease, progressive disease and stable disease over 6 months) 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1  Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma 
 
Tumors of the salivary gland comprise 3 to 6% of all head and neck neoplasms in adults; the 
12  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 incidence is one to three per 100,000 people per year (1) Of the several types of salivary gland 
cancer, adenoid cystic carcinoma is the second most common type, accounting for 22% of cases 
in some series (2). ACC is an indolent cancer with 5-year survival rates as high as 50-90% and 
up to 25% 15-year survival rates. Surgery with wide resection is the main modality of treatment 
for localized ACC. Adjuvant radiation therapy is reserved for patients with poor prognostic 
factors, such as close or positive margins, vascular or perineural invasion, lymph node metastasis 
or high grade tumors. Loco-regional recurrence and distant metastasis especially to the lung are 
not uncommon. A watch and wait approach is appropriate if a patient has metastasis but has few 
or no symptoms due to the indolent nature of the tumor. 
 
Response to chemotherapy agents is around 20% with single agents and 50% with   
combination therapy (3-10). There is no evidence that combination therapy is better than single 
agents and it is unknown if survival is improved with chemotherapy. Active single agents 
include cisplatin, 5-FU, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and vinorelbine. New agents have also been 
studied, but so far their use remains investigational. In the largest study utilizing  imatinib in 
patients with ACC that overexpressed c-kit, no partial or complete responses were seen, stable 
disease was achieved in 9 patients, some of them over 12 months (11). In a phase 2 study of 
trastuzumab in salivary gland tumors that overexpressed Her-2, a partial response was seen in 1 
out of 14 patients (12). Another phase 2 trial utilizing lapatinib, a pan-Erb inhibitor (EGFR and 
HER-2) showed promising activity with 79% of ACC patients with stable disease, 47% of more 
than 6 months (13). A phase 2 trial of gefitinib showed no responses but stable disease in 68% of 
the patients (14). The use of cetuximab also showed no response, but stable disease in 50% of the 
patients with salivary gland tumors (15). A combination trial investigated the use of  bortezomib 
and doxorubicin. Bortezomib was given until progression in patients with metastatic ACC. 
Doxorubicin was added at time of progression. There were no responses to single agent 
bortezomib, however, 64% of patients had stable disease (16).  
 
Stable disease duration has been described in several trials (11,13,15,17,18) as so far partial 
or complete responses have been rarely obtained with the current regimens or experimental 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. It is unclear if stable disease duration represents a marker of drug activity or only the 
indolent nature of this tumor. However, most phase II studies report stable disease duration for [ADDRESS_902849] chemotherapy for the treatment of ACC. Therefore there is a 
need to perform high quality clinical trials in this setting. Multicenter cooperative trials should be 
included in order to maximize patient’s resources due to the rarity of this cancer. 
 
 
2.2 Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) 
 
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; NSC 701852) is a small molecule inhibitor of 
histone deacetylase (HDAC) that binds directly in the enzyme’s active site in the presence of a 
zinc ion (19). Because aberrant HDAC activity has been implicated in a variety of cancers, 
development of HDAC inhibitors is a rational approach to the design of targeted anticancer

inhibitors to be administered to patients, but these were found to be clinically unsuitable due to 
potency and formulation issues (20,21). Depsipeptide was originally selected for clinical study 
based on its antiproliferative effects; subsequently it was discovered to antagonize HDACs (22) 
and was the first HDAC inhibitor to demonstrate clinical efficacy (23).  Of the three classes of 
HDACs, SAHA targets most human Class 1 (related to the yeast transcriptional regulator Rpd3) 
and Class 2 (similar to the yeast Hda1) enzymes (24,25); the third class of HDACs (homologues 
of yeast sir2) requires NAD+ for activity and is not inhibited by [CONTACT_668535].  Among those currently 
in clinical trials, SAHA is the most potent HDAC inhibitor that can be administered orally with 
excellent bioavailability.   
 
 
Mechanism of Action 
 
The HDACs exert their targeted action during post-translational acetylation of core 
nucleosomal histones, which affects chromatin structure, thereby [CONTACT_308055].  
DNA that is wrapped around condensed, non-acetylated histones is transcriptionally inactive, 
whereas acetylation of N-terminal histone lysine residues exposes DNA to important 
transcription factors that promote transcriptional activity (26,27)The dynamic equilibrium 
between histone acetylation and deacetylation is regulated by [CONTACT_188757] (HATs) 
and HDACs.  The action of HDACs on nucleosomal histones leads to tight coiling of chromatin 
and silencing of expression of various genes, including those implicated in the regulation of cell 
survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (28).  The effects of HDACs are not limited 
to histone deacetylation.  HDACs also act as members of a protein complex to recruit 
transcription factors to the promoter region of genes, including those of tumor suppressors, and 
they affect the acetylation status of specific cell cycle regulatory proteins (27)  
 
Nonclinical Activity 
 
SAHA was identified originally by [CONTACT_668536] (29,30). Subsequently, it was found to 
induce differentiation or arrest growth of a wide variety of human carcinoma cells.  To date, 
SAHA activity has been reported in transformed hematopoietic cells, such as multiple myeloma 
(MM) (31-33), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (34), acute lymphocytic leukemia (35), 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (36,37), Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (33), and cutaneous 
T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (38).  Activity has also been reported in cell lines representing other 
tumor types including bladder transitional cell carcinoma (39), breast cancer (40-42), prostate 
cancer (43), head and neck squamous carcinoma (44), and colon carcinoma (45). 
 
The antitumor activity of SAHA was demonstrated in several in vivo  models of cancer, 
including a xenograft model of human CWR22 prostate cancer cells (43), a mouse model of APL 
containing the promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger-retinoic acid receptor α  fusion gene (PLZF-
R
ARα) (46), and an N - methylnitrosourea-induced mammary tumor model in rodents (47).

 SAHA has also showed activity when administered daily by [CONTACT_196720] (IP) injections in the 
CWR22 and PLZF-RAR α models and by [CONTACT_68058] (PO) administration in the carci nogen-induced 
mammary tumor model. 
 
SAHA Combination Studies 
 
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors in 
combination with several other agents in vitro .  The combination of SAHA and DNA 
hypomethylating agents (5-azacytidine or decitabine) acts synergistically to induce apoptosis, 
differentiation, and/or cell growth arrest in various cancer cell lines (48,49).  When SAHA was 
combined with the anti-metabolite 5-fluorouracil, a supra-additive to additive antiproliferative 
effect in wild type and mutant-p53 colorectal cancer cells was observed (50).  SAHA with 
imatinib mesylate (Gleevec®) may be effective in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells 
that resist imatinib mesylate through increased Bcr-Abl expression (36,37).  Minimally toxic 
concentrations of the proteasome inhibitor bortezimib combined with SAHA resulted in 
increased apoptosis in human leukemia cells (37).  In cells from RAR α-PLZF/RARα-PLZF 
t
ransgenic mice and in cells harboring t(15;17) (RAR α-PML fusion genes), SAHA induced 
s
ignificant apoptosis and growth inhibition, effects that were increased by [CONTACT_209482]- trans  
retinoic acid (46). Pre-treating four human cancer cell lines (including a brain tumor line)  with 
SAHA increased the killing efficiency of etoposide, ellipticine, doxorubicin, or cisplatin, but not 
of the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (51).  However, treating cells in the reverse order 
(anticancer drug followed by [CONTACT_668535]) was no more cytotoxic than the anticancer drug alone.  
Finally, overexpression of Bcl-[ADDRESS_902851] its differentiation or cell cycle regulatory effects (45,52,53).  
This suggests that agents blocking Bcl-[ADDRESS_902852] suggested that a consequence of HDAC 
inhibitor-induced heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) acetylation is depletion of the Hsp [ADDRESS_902853] cancer cell lines induced by [CONTACT_668537], 
trastuzumab, epothilone B, and gemcitabine (54,55).  In addition to these potentially additive or 
synergistic interactions between SAHA or other HDACs and various anticancer drugs, SAHA 
has shown synergistic activity when combined with radiotherapy in prostate cancer cell 
spheroids (56). 
 
Phase 1 Clinical Experience 
 
A phase 1 study evaluated vorinostat administered intravenously (IV) to patients with 
advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies (57).  Vorinostat was administered using 
two schedules:  2-hour IV infusion daily x 3 q21d, or daily x 5 for 1 to 3 weeks.  No dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in eight patients administered vorinostat daily x 3 q21d 
at doses of 75, 150, 300, 600, and 900 mg/m²/day.  One solid tumor patient given 900 mg/m² on 
the daily x 5 schedule for 3 weeks developed acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_668489] 3 hypotension.  
Among five other patients at this dose, no additional DLTs were observed.  Among 12 
hematologic and 17 solid tumor patients enrolled on the daily x 5 schedule (300, 600, and 900 
mg/m²/day), therapy was delayed for 1 week for grade 3/4 leukopenia and/or thrombocytope nia 
in two of five patients with hematologic malignancies given 600 mg/m² for 3 weeks.  The 
15  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for hematologic malignancy patients was 300 mg/m² daily x 5 
for 3 weeks.  An MTD for solid tumors was not determined because the study was terminated 
when an oral formulation became available. The mean terminal half-life (t 1/2) ranged from 21 - 
58 minutes, and the dose was linearly proportional to the area under the concentration versus 
time curve (AUC).  Acetylated histones were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) up to [ADDRESS_902854]-therapy tumor biopsies.  Four patients, including two 
with lymphoma and two with bladder cancer, experienced objective tumor regression with 
clinical improvement in tumor-related symptoms. 
 
As of 29-May-2009 the clinical safety of vorinostat is supported by [CONTACT_41224] 854 
patients (858 patient-exposures) who have been treated in [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc sponsored 
Phase I, II, and III studies (Investigator’s Brochure, 2009) conducted in patients with both 
hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. An additional 290 patients were enrolled in a 
randomized, blinded study where patients are randomized in a 1:1 fashion to vorinostat or 
placebo. [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc., including Banyu (Japan), has sponsored 30 vorinostat studies that 
are completed (11),closed (3), or ongoing (14). The NCI is working in collaboration with [COMPANY_006] 
& Co., Inc. to further evaluate vorinostat. The NCI-sponsored studies of vorinostat are in 
progress or are planned in a variety of different indications both in hematologic malignancies as 
well as solid tumors. To date, 1,[ADDRESS_902855] one dose of vorinostat in 
studies sponsored by [CONTACT_668538]., Inc., the NCI or independent Investigators. 
 
The total daily doses studied ranges from 200 mg to 900 mg. The tolerability of 
oral vorinostat appears to be determined by [CONTACT_668539]. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for continuous daily dosing without a rest period is 
[ADDRESS_902856]. Dose-limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) of single agent vorinostat were mainly non-hematologic (anorexia, 
dehydration, diarrhoea, and fatigue); hematologic toxicities are primarily anaemia and 
thrombocytopenia, most of which were mild to moderate. The majority of these DLTs occurred 
within the first month on oral vorinostat. The DLTs were manageable because these toxicities 
resolved quickly after drug administration 
was interrupted. The optimal dose, dose frequency, and dose duration remains under active 
investigation. 
 
The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of vorinostat have been evaluated in 
16  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 mice, rats, dogs and humans. Rapid oral absorption has been noted in all species studied. 
Vorinostat (0.5 to 50 µg/mL) exhibited moderate reversible binding to plasm a proteins. In human 
plasma, vorinostat appears to bind primarily to human serum albumin; however, some binding of 
vorinostat was also observed in solutions of human α1-acid glycoprotein. 
 
V
orinostat is excreted exclusively as metabolites, the majority of metabolites are 
derived from glucuronidation and hydrolysis with β-oxidation pathway metabolites accounting 
f
or the rest. As vorinostat is not eliminated via cytochrome P450 pathways, it is anticipated that 
vorinostat will not be subject to drug-drug interactions when co-administered with drugs that are 
known to be CYP inhibitors. Although vorinostat was not a potent reversible inhibitor of the 
cytochrome P450 isozymes (IC50 >75 µ M), gene expression studies detected some potential for 
suppression of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 activities at ≥10 µM vorinostat however, these changes 
w
ere observed at concentrations higher than the pharmacologically relevant serum concentration 
of 2 µ M (C max). 
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of 26 patients has indicated that the bioavailability of oral 
vorinostat is approximately 46%.  Vorinostat doses in the range of 200 - 600 mg produced 
maximum concentration (C max) and drug exposure (AUC) curves that were linearly proportional.  
The t 1/[ADDRESS_902857] that 
administration of vorinostat with food does not appear to substantially alter the rate or extent of 
absorption.  Inhibition of HDAC activity was achieved in PBMCs at the 200 mg dose level.  At 
dose levels of 400 and 600 mg, the duration of HDAC inhibition lasted >10 hours.  
 
Significant antitumor activity has been observed among members of the above patient 
trial population.  In a phase 1 study of oral vorinostat, seven patients with heavily pre-treated 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were entered.  Among these patients, one complete response (CR) 
and one partial response (PR) were observed.  In addition, one patient has had a significant PET 
scan response.  The PR lasted 5 months, the PET scan response lasted 6 months, and the CR was 
ongoing with a duration >[ADDRESS_902858] been observed (including PRs in 
5 of 13 patients), and 8 of 10 patients reported decreased pruritus.  
 
Zolinza® (vorinostat) was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
on 06-Oct-2006 for the treatment of cutaneous manifestations in patients with cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma (CTCL) who have progressive, persistent or recurrent disease on or following two 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Phase I and II clinical studies of Vorinostat sponsored by [CONTACT_44873] & Co., Inc., 
Banyu (Japan), and the NCI have emonstrated confirmed anti-tumor activity in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML), advanced multiple myeloma, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 
squamous cell laryngeal carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast carcinoma, non-small cell lung 
carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and myelodysplastic syndrome. 
 
 
17  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902859] demonstrated that the major 
pathways of metabolism of vorinostat involve glucuronidation, and hydrolysis 
followed by β-oxidation (Investigator’s Brochure, 2009). As vorin ostat is not eliminated via 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathways, it is anticipated that vorinostat will not be subject to drug-
drug interactions when co-administered with drugs that are known to be CYP inhibitors or 
inducers. Since vorinostat was neither a potent inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP enzymes, drug-
drug interactions caused by [CONTACT_668540]. Additionally, vorinostat is not 
recovered intact in urine to any appreciable extent. Therefore, compounds known to affect renal 
elimination are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of vorinostat. 
 
Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were 
observed in patients receiving vorinostat concomitantly with  coumarin-derivative 
anticoagulants. Physicians should carefully monitor PT and INR in patients concurrently 
administered vorinostat and coumarin derivatives. 
 
Vorinostat should not be administered concomitantly with other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., 
valproic acid) as class-specific adverse reactions may be additive. Severe (Grade 4) 
thrombocytopenia with associated gastrointestinal bleeding and anaemia has been reported with 
the concomitant use of vorinostat and valproic acid. 
 
Patients who have received HDAC inhibitors or compounds with HDAC inhibitor like 
activity, such as valproic acid, for anti-neoplastic therapy should not enroll in vorinostat oncology 
trials. Patients who have received such agents for other indications, e.g epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], may enroll on 
vorinostat trials after a 30-day wash-out period. 
 
 
2.3  FDG PET/CT 
 
Assessment of tumor response to therapy plays a central role in drug development as well 
as clinical patient management.  Currently response is mainly evaluated by [CONTACT_668541], such as those of the World 
Health Organization (WHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 
criteria (58-60).  However, response rates as assessed by [CONTACT_668542]. Furthermore, response is evaluated not earlier than 2-[ADDRESS_902860] suggested that positron emission tomography 
(PET) with the glucose analog fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) may be used to monitor tumor 
response very early in the course of therapy.  Quantitative changes in tumor FDG uptake 2-[ADDRESS_902861] been shown to correlate well with subsequent tumor shrinkage 
and patient survival in some tumor types (table 1). Conversely, the absence of a measurable 
decrease in tumor FDG uptake after the first chemotherapy cycle has been found to predict lack 
18  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 of tumor shrinkage and poor patient survival.

Thus, FDG-PET has the potential to improve patient management by [CONTACT_668543]-responders, thereby [CONTACT_668544].  Furthermore, as an early indicator of clinical benefit, FDG-PET may also 
facilitate oncologic drug development by [CONTACT_668545].   
 
An exploratory objective of this study (pending funding) will be to assess the association 
between a metabolic response after one and two cycles of chemotherapy and subsequent best 
tumor response according to standard anatomic response evaluation criteria (RECIST 1.1). The 
PET studies will be optional. 
 
19  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902862] of our knowledge, there is very few data published on the use of PET scans to 
monitor response in ACC (67,68). Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was chosen as a model 
because the data on this tumor type is more mature and abundant. 
 
A previous study has indicated that, in patients with advanced NSCLC, changes in tumor 
FDG uptake after one cycle of chemotherapy are well correlated with patient survival (65).  In 
addition, a study evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy has also shown that metabolic activity 
after one chemotherapy cycle is highly predictive of patient survival (66).  A second study in 
patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy retrospectively analyzed PET scans of 
patients with locally advanced NSCLC imaged after three cycles of induction chemotherapy and 
after completion of chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy) (69).  Changes in tumor FDG uptake at both time 
points were predictive of patient survival.  However, most of the patients underwent only two 
and not three PET studies.  There are some data in locally advanced breast and esophageal 
cancer that PET imaging after one cycle of chemotherapy may be a slightly better predictor of 
patient survival than PET after 2-6 cycles (62,70,71).  
 
Both patients treated in the NCI protocol 8057 ( section 2.4 ) experienced subjective 
clinical and/or laboratorial improvement around 2-3 weeks after starting treatment with 
vorinostat. Therefore, this trial will measure changes in tumor FDG uptake after one and two 
cycles of chemotherapy. 
 
Definition of a Metabolic Response in FDG-PET 
 
Based on the reproducibility of the FDG-signal in untreated tumors, relative changes of 
approximately 20% are very unlikely to be due to measurement errors or spontaneous 
fluctuations of tumor metabolic activity (72,73).  These data establish the minimal effect of 
treatment on tumor metabolic activity that can be assessed by [CONTACT_6789]-PET.  However, a 
measurable change in metabolic activity does not necessarily imply that treatment has a 
beneficial effect for the patient.  A recent study evaluated the prognostic implications of a 
measurable change in tumor glucose utilization in patients with advanced NSCLC, who were 
treated with palliative platinum-based chemotherapy.  A "metabolic response" in PET was 
prospectively defined as decrease of the SUV of the primary tumor by [CONTACT_2669] 20%.  A total of 
[ADDRESS_902863] 
chemotherapy cycle.  Median progression-free survival of metabolic nonresponders was only 1.8 
months versus 5.9 months for metabolic responders.  Median overall survival of metabolic 
responders was 8.4 months and only 5.0 months for metabolic nonresponders (65).  The 
sensitivity and specificity of a metabolic response for prediction of best response according to 
RECIST criteria were 95% and 74%, respectively. 
 
These data indicate that a measurable change in tumor FDG uptake after the first cycle of 
chemotherapy is associated with a palliative effect of therapy.  These data and the data on the 
test-retest reproducibility of FDG-PET suggest that a 20% decrease in tumor FDG uptake may be 
20  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 used to define a metabolic response in patients with NSCLC.  However, we will use slightly 
stricter criteria for a metabolic response in the present study and define a metabolic response as a 
decrease of tumor FDG uptake by 25%.  The rationale for this definition is that the test/retest 
reproducibility of FDG-PET in a multicenter trial may be lower than previously reported in 
single-center studies.  Therefore, a 20% threshold may not be robust enough for a multicenter 
trial.  Defining a metabolic response as a 25% decrease of tumor FDG uptake makes this study 
also consistent with previous recommendations by [CONTACT_51222] (74).  
 
Although data in the literature support the use of a 25% decrease in tumor FDG uptake as 
a criterion for a metabolic response, we cannot exclude that other threshold values may allow a 
better prediction of patient outcome.  Therefore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
will be calculated for prediction of best response by [CONTACT_668546].  Predictive accuracy will be evaluated through 95% 
confidence intervals for the area under the ROC curve (75) 
 
All PET/CT data will follow the guidelines specified in appendices B and C (76) .  
 
 
2.4 Rationale 
  
Case Reports 
Two patients with ACC were treated in the NCI protocol 8057 (Phase I and 
pharmacokinetic study of vorinostat for solid tumors and lymphomas in patients with varying 
degrees of hepatic dysfunction) at the Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI), Detroit, MI. Both 
patients displayed significant subjective clinical and/or laboratorial improvement. One patient 
also experienced partial response on the liver metastasis. Based on those cases, we propose to 
investigate the activity of vorinostat in patients with ACC. A brief summary of those cases is 
described below. 
 
Case 1 
40 year old Caucasian female with a diagnosis of ACC stage III of the right parotid in 
1997. Patient underwent right neck dissection and total parotidectomy on 11/03/97. Adjuvant 
radiation therapy to the left maxilla and mandible at 6200cGY was delivered. Metastatic disease 
to the bone, lung and liver were diagnosed in August of 2006. Palliative radiation therapy to the 
bone was delivered from T9 to L1 (30Gy) and from L3 to S2 (30Gy). Patient opted for a watch 
and wait approach until January of 2008. 
 
Previous treatments included a phase 1 trial utilizing a hedgehog inhibitor from 01/22/08 
to 03/24/08. Treatment was discontinued due to progression of disease. Patient subsequently 
enrolled on another phase 1 trial utilizing a telomerase inhibitor from 05/15/08 to 06/16/08, 
discontinued due to progression of disease in the liver. 
 
Patient enrolled on the liver dysfunction NCI protocol 8057 on 07/24/08. A flat dose of 
400mg of vorinostat was given on day -6 (07/24/08), followed by a 200mg daily dose starting on 
07/31/08. At the time of enrollment, patient’s liver enzymes and bilirrubin levels placed her on 
21  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 the moderate liver dysfunction cohort (see table below ). On 08/21/08, a decrease in bilirrubin 
levels was observed as well as a minor decrease in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Decrease in 
the liver span and firmness on physical examination were noticed. Patient reported improvement 
in symptoms, such as less bloating since the start of treatment. CT scans done at the end of 8 
weeks of treatment showed stable disease, but on cycle 3 day 1 (09/11/08), ALT level was 
normal, AST was only mildly elevated (grade 1) and bilirrubin was normal. On 10/02/08, due to 
complete normalization of liver enzymes, vorinostat dose was increased from 200mg to 400mg 
(normal dose cohort). Patient’s CT scans showed partial response in the liver after 5 months into 
the trial, with stable disease in the lung. Liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and bilirrubin return to 
normal limits (table 2). Patient was taken off trial on April 30, 2009 due to interstitial 
pneumonitis (possibly drug related). 
 
Adverse events observed included pulmonary embolism (probably drug related), grade 1 
elevation of hemoglobin and alkaline phosphatase. Patient also experienced grade 2 
thrombocytopenia, completely resolved. Patient also experienced adrenal insufficiency, needing 
steroids replacement and had 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_668490].

Case 2  
40 year old Caucasian male with a diagnosis of ACC stage IVB of the left nasopharynx in 
January 2003.  Patient was treated with a LeFort I approach resection through the sphenoid sinus 
and pterigopalatine fossa on the same month. Tumor was not totally resected, due to extension to 
carotid artery. He subsequently received adjuvant radiation therapy by [CONTACT_2236]-modulated 
external beam radiation therapy (IMRT) to the nasal cavity and sinus (at a dose of 50.4Gy) as 
well as radiosurgery boost to the residual sinus lesion (10Gy). Radiation therapy was completed 
in May of 2003. Patient developed metastatic lung disease in May of 2006. Lung biopsy 
confirmed metastatic ACC. At the same time, a renal mass was found in his left kidney. Biopsy 
was performed and it was positive for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. It was surgically 
resected by [CONTACT_668547] 29, 2006 with no evidence of recurrence from this 
cancer until the present moment.   
 
Patient was treated with sorafenib from May 2007 to June 2007. Treatment was 
discontinued upon patient’s request; no evaluation for response was performed. Re-irradiation to 
the recurrent disease on the left pterygopalatine fossa, left trigeminal nerve and cavernous sinus

Previous treatments included a phase 1 trial utilizing a hedgehog inhibitor from 11/19/07 
to 02/14/08. Treatment was discontinued due to progression of disease and worsening of 
symptoms. Patient subsequently enrolled on another phase 1 trial utilizing a telomerase inhibitor 
from 03/24/08 to 05/2708, discontinued due to progression of disease. He underwent another 
phase 1 trial with a vascular disrupting agent from 07/07/08 to 08/18/08. Treatment was 
discontinued due to intolerable side effects. 
 
Treatment on the NCI protocol 8057 with vorinostat at 400mg orally daily (normal dose 
cohort) was started on 10/09/08. Clinical benefit was noted within the first month of treatment 
with vorinostat, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_668548], increase in energy levels and weight 
gain. CT thorax after 8 weeks of treatment showed decrease in the size of the lung metastasis in 
the range of 10-20%. Significant adverse events included grade 2 asymptomatic elevation of 
creatinine, which after a 5-day discontinuation of the drug returned to the patient’s baseline. 
Grade 1 decrease in hemoglobin and platelets were also observed. Patient remained on the study 
until 01/12/09, off study due to progression of disease.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
 
4.1 General Guidelines 
 
Eligible patients will be entered on study centrally at the Karmanos Cancer Institute by [CONTACT_224192].  All sites should call the Study Coordinator at [PHONE_13898] to verify agent 
availability.   
 
Following registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within 72 hours.  Issues that 
would cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.  If a patient 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the patient’s registration on the study 
may be cancelled.  The Study Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as 
possible. 
 
Except in very unusual circumstances, each participating institution will order DCTD-
supplied agents directly from CTEP.  Agents may be ordered by a participating site only after the 
initial IRB approval for the site has been forwarded by [CONTACT_36477] 
([EMAIL_617]) except for Group studies.

5. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
         5.1 Vorinostat Administration 
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential 
risks are described in Section 7 .  Appropriate dose modifications for vorinostat are  described in 
Section 6 .  No investigational or commercial agents or therap ies other than those described 
below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy. 
 
On Day [ADDRESS_902877] cycle of vorinostat will be initiated on a continuous daily oral regimen 
at 400mg PO. The dose may be reduced for individual patients in subsequent cycles depending 
on toxicity (See Section 6.2.2 ). Each treatment cycle will consist of [ADDRESS_902878] their daily dose in a “pi[INVESTIGATOR_668492]”. Missed/ skipped pi[INVESTIGATOR_668493]-taken. Patients should be instructed to record those pi[INVESTIGATOR_668494].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_902879] 3 days of therapy, may be required. Patients 
should also be encouraged to seek a nutritional consult. 
 
Diarrhea: Treat diarrhea promptly with appropriate supportive care, including loperamide. 
Instruct patients to begin taking loperamide at the first signs of: 1) poorly formed or loose stool, 
2) occurrence of more bowel movements than usual in one day, or 3) unusually high volume of 
stool. Loperamide should be taken in the following manner: [ADDRESS_902880] onset of diarrhea, then 
2 mg after each unformed stool. Daily dose should not exceed 16 mg/day. Loperamide should 
not be taken prophylactically. Advise patients to drink plenty of clear fluids to help prevent 
dehydration caused by [CONTACT_16651]. Avoid loperamide if there is the presence of blood or mucus in 
the stool or if diarrhea is accompanied by [CONTACT_411]. If grade 3 or 4 diarrhea develops, discontinue 
further treatment with vorinostat.

5.3 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue for until 
one of the following criteria applies: 
• Disease progression, 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s), 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
• If a female patient gets pregnant during the study 
 
Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed above applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the Case 
Report Form.

 6.2 Dose Modification Guidelines 
 
6.2.1 During the Course o f a Cycle: 
 
The dose of vorinostat will be held during the course of the cycle for one or more of the 
following events: 
•  Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
• Any grade 4 non-hematological toxicity 
• Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity that cannot be controlled with appropriate supportive 
care measures. 
 
Treatment can be restarted with a reduction in dose (refer to table 3 ) once the toxicity 
resolves to severity of grade 1 or less. Inability to start the next cycle within 3 weeks (21 days) of 
the scheduled start due to toxicity will result in removal of the patient from the study, unless the 
patient is deriving benefit. In the later case, a discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or CTEP senior 
investigator will ensue. 
 
6.2.2 Dose Modification for Subsequent Cycles 
 
Laboratory parameters should be obtained within 72 hours prior to initiation of the next cycle 
of therapy.

7. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
7.1 Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (NSC 701852) 
 
Chemical Name: N-hydroxy-N’-phenyl-octane-1,8-diotic acid diamide;  
N-hydroxyl-N’-phenyl (9CI) octanediamide  
 
Other Names:   SAHA, Vorinostat, L-001079038, WIN [ZIP_CODE], MSK390, AP390, 
Zolinza™. 
 
Classification:   Antineoplastic 
 
CAS Registry Number:  149647-78-9 
 
Molecular Formula: C14H20N203  M.W.: 264 
 
Approximate Solubility:   Water < 5 mg/mL 
 
Description:  Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor  
 
Mode of Action:   Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a family of enzymes that regulate 
chromatin remodeling and gene transcription via the dynamic 
process of acetylation and deacetylation of core histones. 
 
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a potent inhibitor of HDAC 
activity, binds directly to the catalytic pocket of HDAC enzymes. 
SAHA causes G1 or G2 phase cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, or 
differentiation in cultured transformed cells. 
 
How Supplied:  Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid is supplied by [CONTACT_200174]., Inc. 
and distributed by [CONTACT_16656], DCTD, NCI.  Suberoylanilide 
hydroxamic acid is supplied in the following strength: 
30  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 1. a white, opaque gelatin capsule containing 100 mg (size 3 
capsule) of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid  
 
The inactive ingredients contained in each capsule are 
microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, and magnesium 
stearate.  
 
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid 100 mg capsules are supplied in 
bottles of 120 capsules.  
 
Storage:  Store suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid capsules at room temperature, 
15 to 30 ºC (59 to 86 ºF).  Do not store above 30 ºC .Avoid exposure 
to excessive moisture.  
 
Stability: Shelf life stability studies of the intact bottles are ongoing. 
 
Route  of Administration:   Orally 
 
Method of Administration:   Unless otherwise stated in the protocol, suberoylanilide 
hydroxamic acid capsules must be administered whole. 
The absolute bioavailability of suberoylanilide 
hydroxamic acid under fasted or fed conditions is 
approximately 46%. Oral administration with food does 
not appear to substantially alter the rate or extent of 
absorption. 
 
Potential Drug Interactions: Vorinostat has a low propensity to cause or be affected by 
[CONTACT_9934]-drug interactions. In vivo  animal models and in 
vitro human systems have demonstrated that the major 
pathways of metabolism of vorinostat involve 
glucuronidation, and hydrolysis followed by β- oxidation. 
A
s vorinostat is not eliminated via cytochrome P450 
(CYP) pathways, it is anticipated that vorinostat will not 
be subject to drug-drug interactions when co-
administered with drugs that are known to be CYP 
inhibitors or inducers. Additionally, vorinostat is not 
recovered intact in urine to any appreciable extent. 
Therefore, compounds known to affect renal elimination 
are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of 
vorinostat. Prothrombin time and INR prolongation have 
been reported in patients taking vorinostat concomitantly 
with coumadin derivatives anticoagulants. Monitor these 
patients more frequently in their coagulation parameters.  
 
Special Handling: SAHA is an anticancer drug. Powder spi[INVESTIGATOR_668495]

  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902889] be washed with copi[INVESTIGATOR_668496]. 
 
Patient Care Implications:  Because vorinostat’s dose limiting toxicities are anorexia, 
dehydration, diarrhea, and fatigue, patients should 
maintain adequate fluid and food intake. Encourage 
patients to seek a nutritional consult. 
 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) 
for 
Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza, NSC 701852) 
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
[CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to 
Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized 
text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited 
reporting to NCI via CTEP-AERS (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse 
Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf for further 
clarification. Frequency is provided based on 702 patients. Below is the CAEPR for vorinostat (SAHA, 
Zolinza). 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the 
AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational 
agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if 
expedited reporting is required.

 Note : Vorinostat (SAHA, Zolinza) in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any 
adverse event currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events 
never previously associated with either agent. 
 
7.2 Agent Availability 
 
Vorinostat is an investigational agent supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_131797] (DCTD), NCI. 
 
      Vorinostat is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement between [COMPANY_006] and 
Co., Inc. and the DCTD, NCI (see  Section 11.4 ). 
 
7.3 Agent Ordering 
NCI supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy 
requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB 
does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is 
obtained.)  The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP supplied 
investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be 
registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial 
Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP 
supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_25559].

Methods 
 
Samples 
B
arbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) has a set of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) tumor blocks or slides from individual ACC patients who were treated with SAHA. A 
high number of patients had stable disease on treatment over 6 months (median and range), and 
we observed a partial response in 2 of the patients in this trial. These FFPE samples are well 
annotated with clinical follow-up and represent highly favorable samples to exploit for 
advancing improved outcomes in ACC. 
This study will use previously collected FFPE tissue blocks or slides from 10 patients (all  
available samples may be used at a later point) who achieved some benefit from SAHA and  
patients whose tumors did not demonstrate a therapeutic response. If an entire FFPE block is not 
available, PI's will request up to 20 unstained slides (10 microns).  A deidentified, coded copy of 
the pathology report will also be sent with the FFPE block or slides. 
Whole blood was also collected on most of the patients at the time of enrollment in the original 
study.  Karmanos will send white blood cells from the blood to TGen to serve as patient matched 
germline DNA.  If no blood exists from a selected patient, or the blood was of poor quality, 
Karmanos study personnel will recontact [CONTACT_668552] a 
new blood sample. 
Blood samples will be spun down to remove the white blood cells from the red blood cells.  The 
white blood cell pellet will be snap frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -80° until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_668497]. 
 
All samples and data will be de-identified and coded with a unique study code assigned by 
[CONTACT_668553].  A key linking the patient name [CONTACT_668572] [CONTACT_668553].  TGen will not receive any patient identifiable 
information before, during or after this study is conducted.

Volumetric Tumor Assesment (refer to appendix I for details)_ 
RECIST criteria uses 2D-proxies (single maximum diameter on axial images) to estimate 
tumor volumes. RECIST is limited in that it only assess tumor response in terms of 
change in maximal axial diameter of selected target lesions.  
 
Recent studies in metastatic cancer have demonstrated the added value of accounting for 
tumor density and volume using size and attenuation CT (SACT), mass attenuation, size 
and structure (MASS), or modified versions of the original Choi CT response criteria, 
beyond RECIST.  
 
We propose a retrospective comprehensive assesment of tumor response, using total 
viable tumor volume (VTV) to quantify the change in viable versus necrotic tumor 
volumes across all lesions through volumetric characterization of density distribution 
throughout all parts of measurable tumors.  
 
In this retrospective study, imaging already obtained (CT and/or MRI) from patients with 
locally advanced, recurrent or metastastic adenoid cystic carcinoma treated on this trial 
will be   re-reviewed.  
 
Target lesions will be volumetric segmented by a research assistant blinded to clinical 
status withing PACS (Carestream VuePACS v12.0, [COMPANY_002]ster, NY).

  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902901] 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re-evaluated for response every 8   weeks. 
Patients may receive scans every 3 cycles/12 weeks (± 1 week) after completing [ADDRESS_902902] tumor 
measurements (CT scans or MRI) done every 24 weeks (±10 days). In addition to a baseline 
scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 (not less than 4) weeks following initial 
documentation of objective response.  
 
10.1 Definitions 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] 
(RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) (58).  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the 
case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_902903] their response classified according to the definitions stated 
below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end 
of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, 
have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-
evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target disease.  The response 
assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the 
lesions.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_902904] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as 
>[ADDRESS_902905] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_902906] scan, or >[ADDRESS_902907] be recorded in millimeters (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or 
might not be considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_902908] 
42  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 
m
m short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-
measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions. 
 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as 
target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in 
which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly 
should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only 
the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
10.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to 
the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of 
the treatment. 
43  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. 
Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_147877](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
[CONTACT_461]. 
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when 
they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is 
preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_902909] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable 
lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain 
situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and 
temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables 
involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and 
measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with 
CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the 
same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, 
and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  
Body 
scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT 
performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic 
CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used 
for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional 
CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the 
44  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902910] in selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm 
complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine 
relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical 
resection is an endpoint. 
 
Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for 
both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in 
recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [ JNCI  96:487-488, 2004; J Clin 
Oncol  17, 3461-3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  26:1148-1159, 2008].  In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_902911]-line trials in 
ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534-1535, 2000]. 
 
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign 
tumors can remain). 
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears 
or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable 
disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease. 
 
FDG-PET  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' 
disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified 
according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a 
45  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not 
confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans 
are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site 
(if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET 
scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar 
to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought 
to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and 
supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity. 
  
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an 
uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation 
corrected image. 
 
10.1.4  Response Criteria 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis 
to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 
5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered 
46  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in 
size (<10 mm short axis) 
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion 
status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.     
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], 
and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_157773] (or Principal Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*  ‘Non-CR/non-PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non-target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this 
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised 
 
10.1.5  Duration of Response 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.

  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
  
Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.  
 
10.1.6  Progression-Free Survival 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. 
 
10.2 Other Response Parameters 
10.2.1  Time to Response (TTR) 
TTR is measured from the start of the treatment until the RECIST measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded).   TTR only applies to 
the patients achieving either PR or CR, and involves no censoring. 
 
10.2.2 Overall Survival (OS) 
OS is measured from the start of treatment until death from any cause. OS is 
subject to censoring.

12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
12.1.1. Study Design: 
We will use a 2-stage Simon (1989) optimal design to minimize the number of patients to 
be treated.  Complete + partial (CR+PR) rate will be the primary statistical endpoint.  We wish to 
distinguish response rate regions of at most 5% vs. at least 20%.   For this 2-stage design its 
Stage 1 will require 12 response-evaluable (r-e) patients.  At least 1 responder in Stage 1 will be 
needed to justify continuing to Stage 2, which will require 17 more r-e patients (i.e., maximum of 
N=29 r-e patients for the study). If ≥ 3 responders are observed among the final 29 r-e pa tients, 
then vorinostat will be considered promising.   If < 3, conclude that vorinostat has insufficient 
efficacy to justify further study.     This design specifies significance level = 0.15, and power = 
0.90, and has a probability of early termination (PET) = 0.540 under the null hypothesis.  Alpha 
is relaxed in this design since there are no effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55328], but beta is limited to 0.10 
to better ensure that we identify vorinostat as a promising therapy, if it truly is one. 
 
In ACC, late responses (by [CONTACT_393]) may occur; hence we anticipate the need to suspend 
accrual after [ADDRESS_902924] little efficacy, disease progression among the Stage 1 patients will be more rapid, 
thus limiting the time until study termination can be justified based on the Stage 1 response 
results.    
 
12.1.2 Study Endpoints: 
The primary endpoint is objective response based on RECIST 1.1 criteria.  Response 
criteria and categories are defined in detail in Sections 10.1.1-10.1.4 . 
 
Secondary endpoints include toxicity, time to response (TTR), response duration (RD), 
progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).   Definition, assessment, and 
reporting of toxicity (adverse events) may be found in Sections 6.[ADDRESS_902925], PFS, and 
OS are defined in Sections 10.2.1 , 10.1.5 , 10.1.6 , and 10.2.2 , respectively. 
55  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
  
Exploratory endpoints include metabolic response by [CONTACT_10052]/CT scan, and several laboratory 
biomarkers listed in Section 1.3  (Exploratory Objectives), and described in Section 8  and in the 
Appendix D . 
 
12.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
We anticipate an accrual rate of 1-2 ACC patients/month from the 10 organ dysfunction 
working group institutions combined.  That would yield an expected combined accrual rate of 
12-24 patients/year.  At that rate, [ADDRESS_902926] patient begins treatment. 
 
If Stage 2 is needed (i.e., an additional 17 r-e patients), that should take an additional 9-17 
months of accrual, plus up to 12 additional months for the discovery of late responders.  Thus, a 
final analysis result at the end of Stage 2 (if Stage 2 is needed) should be obtainable within 39-[ADDRESS_902927] been collected.

12.4  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 
56  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 There are 5 Secondary Objectives: 
 
1) To characterize the safety and tolerability of vorinostat in this patient population 
 2) To assess the time to response (TTR) 
 3) To assess the response duration (RD) 
 4) To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) 
 5) To assess overall survival (OS) 
   
 
Secondary Objective 1 concerns toxicity and adverse events, hence will involve 
categorical variables.   They will be tabulated via frequency distributions, and also dichotomized 
to report the proportion (and percentage) of patients experiencing a specified level (e.g., Grade 3-
4) of toxicity.   Analysis of these proportions (i.e., rates) will include both point and 90% 
confidence interval (CI) estimates, with the CI estimates calculated via Wilson’s method.   The 
90% confidence level is appropriate for either the Stage 1 sample size (n=12) or even the Stage 2 
sample size (n=29) planned for this Phase II trial. 
 
Secondary Objective [ADDRESS_902928] deviation 
(SD), standard error (SE), minimum, maximum, and 90% CI for the mean calculated from the 
SE and asymptotic Normal distribution theory. 
 
Secondary Objectives 3-5 concern censored time-to-event (TTE) endpoints.   Their 
distribution will be estimated using standard survival analysis techniques, and the Kaplan-Meier 
(K-M) method.   From the K-M life tables, both point and 90% CI estimates of various statistics 
of interest can be calculated (e.g., median, 6-month event-free rate, 12-month event-free rate, 
etc.).  Statistical graphs of each K-M curve (with 90% CI lines) will be generated for visual 
display of these censored TTE endpoints. 
 
 
There are 7 Exploratory Objectives: 
 
1) To assess the association between a metabolic response by [CONTACT_10052]/CT after one cycle of 
chemotherapy and subsequent best tumor response according to standard anatomic response 
evaluation criteria (RECIST). 
 
2) To assess the association between a metabolic response by [CONTACT_10052]/CT after the first and second 
chemotherapy cycle and PFS. 
 
3) Flow sort diploid, aneuploid, and tetraploid populations of tumor cells from FFPE tissue 
blocks from patients who benefited from SAHA therapy and from patients who did not 
demonstrate a durable benefit.  
 
4) Profile the genomes of each cell population using oligonucleotide CGH arrays. This will 
confirm the identification of tumor populations in each sample and provide genomic landmarks 
57  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 for NGS analysis.  
 
5) Perform whole exome analysis of the sorted tumor population and matching germ line sample 
for each of the patients. The combined aCGH and exome data will be mined to identify genes 
and pathways that are targeted by [CONTACT_668555] 
 
6)  To assess stable disease duration (SDD). 
 
7)  To assess the association between response to vorinostat treatment and HR23B on tumor 
paraffin blocks. 
 
 
Exploratory Objective 1 concerns the potential association of PET/CT response 
(magnitude of decrease in SUV after 1 treatment cycle) with clinical response by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
criteria.   Percent change in SUV ( /uni2206SUV) is a continuous variable, whereas objective res ponse is 
a categorical (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], binary) variable.   First, we will use receiver operator characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis to determine the optimal cutoff in the distribution of /uni2206 SUV, in relationship 
t
o objective response (yes/no).   That will allow us to define “PET response”.  We will also 
compare the descriptive statistics of the /uni2206 SUV distribution in the RECIST responders vs non-
r
esponders. At Stage 1 (n=12), the association of /uni2206SUV with subsequent best tumor response 
w
ill be explored in a simple 2 x 2 contingency table, with point and 90% CI estimates of 
objective response rates among the patients with vs. without PET response. Descriptively only, 
we can then examine the point and CI estimates to see if there is a hint of any association. At 
Stage 2 (n=29), we would repeat the same descriptive, exploratory investigation, and then 
determine what, if any, additional statistical analysis might be appropriate.   For example, that 
might involve exact logistic regression to model the log-odds of later objective response as a 
function of only one predictor:  early PET response (yes/no).   This exact logistic modeling 
investigation would still be viewed as exploratory only, but would yield a point and 90% CI 
estimate of the odds ratio for response. 
 
Exploratory Objective 2 concerns the potential association of PET/CT response 
(magnitude of decrease in SUV after 1 treatment cycle) with censored PFS. “PET response” 
(yes/no) will be determined as just described above for Exploratory Objective 1. At Stage 1 
(n=12), to explore the potential association of PET/CT response with length of censored PFS, we 
will use the Cox proportional hazards model.   This analysis will focus on the length of PFS after  
the second PET/CT scan, and will be exploratory only.   The goal would be to determine if there 
is any hint of a potential positive association in the hypothesized direction , i.e., is the hazard 
ratio (HR) < 1 or not for patients with an early PET/CT response. At Stage 2 (n=29), we would 
repeat the same Cox model investigation, but pay more attention to the magnitude of (HR), its 
precision (i.e., half-width of it 90% CI), but not its statistical significance (i.e., p-value). Again, 
this Cox modeling investigation would still be viewed as exploratory only. A similar analysis 
will be performed utilizing the third PET/CT scan, taken after 2 treatment cycles, at day 56.

  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
   Exploratory Objectives 3, 4 and 5 are strictly exploratory and will be reported as 
descriptive results 
 
            Exploratory Objective 6 concerns yet another time-to-event endpoint (SDD), which is 
defined in Section 10.1.5 .    The analysis of the censored SDD distribution w ill use the same 
approach as described above for Secondary Objectives 3-5 .  
 
Exploratory Objective 7 concerns a biomarker (HR23B), measured by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC).  Its expression level will be recorded as:  0,  1+,  2+,  or 3+.   In 
light of the small to modest sample sizes for this Phase II trial (either n=12 after Stage 1, or n=29 
after Stage 2), we will dichotomize the total staining score (TSS) of HR23B into ≥ 6 (“positive”) 
o
r < 6 (“negative”). 
 At Stage 1 (n=12), the association of  HR23B’s dichotomized expression level 
(absence/presence) to objective response (yes/no) can be explored via a simple 2 x 2 contingency 
table. From the table we can compute the point and 90% CI estimates of response rates among 
the patients who do vs. those who do not “express” HR23B.  The most basic exploratory 
observation will be the direction  of the association, i.e., whether the point-estimate of response 
rate is higher (or lower) among expressers of HR23B.     We can also observe the precision in the 
estimate of the response rate via its CI.    
 At Stage 2 (n=29), we would repeat the same descriptive, exploratory investigation, and 
then determine what, if any, additional statistical analysis might be appropriate. For example, 
that might involve exact logistic regression to model the log-odds of later objective response as a 
function   “expression” of HR23B (yes/no). This exact logistic modeling investigation would still 
be viewed as exploratory only, but would yield a point and 90% CI estimate of the odds ratio for 
response.

are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned 
one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early 
death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
[CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a 
clinical database.] 
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those 
who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  
Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment 
(disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not

treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these sub-analyses may not serve as the 
basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding 
patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence intervals should also 
be provided.

PET Imaging Acquisition Parameters and Image Data Analysis 
 
 
Additional information for PET Imaging Acquisition Parameters and Analysis  are available on 
the ACRIN web site at (www.acrin.org/6678_protocol.aspx).(76)   
 
Acquisition and Analysis of FDG-PET/CT Scans 
FDG-PET/CT scans will be performed according to the guidelines for NCI-sponsored studies as 
recently published by [CONTACT_668557]. (77). 
 
1. Participant Preparation  
Participants must fast for a minimum of 4 hours prior to the injection of FDG for the PET scan. 
However, they will be encouraged to drink water to ensure adequate hydration. 
• Upon arrival at the PET facility, the participant’s weight and height will be measured and 
recorded.  Serum glucose should be measured to determine that the blood glucose 
concentration is within the normal range.  
• If the serum glucose concentration is found to be greater than 150 mg/dL, the study should 
be rescheduled.  The referring oncologist or the primary physician of the patient will be 
contact[CONTACT_668558]. 
• The participant should be placed in a comfortable position, either supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]-
recumbent.  A large-bore intravenous line (21-gauge or greater) should be placed in an 
arm or hand vein.  The room should be kept warm to avoid shivering and temperature 
effects that may increase muscular or fat uptake.  The participant should move as little as 
possible and should not talk more than necessary in the first 30 min following FDG 
injection. 
• Prior to positioning the participant on the PET scanner the participant should be asked to 
urinate.  
 
2. Injection of [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
• The dose of FDG to be administered should be 10 to 20 millicuries (mCi), adjusted 
according to weight as suggested by [CONTACT_212572].   
• FDG will be synthesized and prepared in accordance with USP compendial standards.  
• The exact time of calibration of the dose should be recorded and the exact time of 
injection noted to permit correction of the administered dose for radioactive decay.  In 
addition, the dose remaining in the tubing or syringe, or that was spi[INVESTIGATOR_668503]. The injection should be performed through an intravenous catheter.

  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 • PET scanning must begin 60 ± [ADDRESS_902939] scan (less than 10 min difference in 
uptake times). 
• Participants will generally be positioned in the PET/CT scanner with their arms raised 
above the head.  If participants cannot tolerate this position for the duration of the PET/CT 
study, a different participant positioning may be chosen.  However, arms should be 
positioned in the same way at the baseline and the follow-up studies. 
• A low-dose CT scan will be acquired for attenuation correction and anatomical 
localization of findings in the PET scan.  
• The acquisition parameter for the low-dose CT scan for attenuation correction should be:  
kV = 120-140; effective mAs = 30-120 (patient dependent); gantry rotation time ≤ 0.8 sec; 
m
aximum reconstructed width = 3-5 mm without overlap; standard reconstruction 
algorithm, minimum reconstruction diameter = outer arm to outer arm; and without 
iodinated contrast (78). 
• The axial field of view of the CT scan for attenuation correction will range from the mid 
thighs to the base of the skull.  Arm positioning will be the same as for the PET scan, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_668504]. 
• The CT scan will be performed during "shallow breathing" as described previously 67.  No 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_668505]. 
• After the CT scan, a PET scan covering the same axial field of view will be performed.  
This scan will start at the mid thighs.  The number of bed positions and the acquisition 
time per bed position will be scanner specific.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_446426] 6 bed positions and 
an acquisition of 2-5 min per bed position. 
 
4. Image Reconstruction 
• The PET data will be corrected for dead time, scatter, randoms and attenuation using 
standard algorithms provided by [CONTACT_668559].  
• Image reconstruction will be performed. 
 
5. Image Analysis  
• Activity concentrations in the attenuation-corrected PET images will be converted to 
standardized uptake values (SUVs) by [CONTACT_668560]-
corrected injected dose and multiplying with the body weight of the participant. 
• A circular region of interest (ROI) with a diameter of 0.75 to 1.5 cm will be centered at 
the site of maximum FDG uptake within this lesion.  ROIs of the same size will be placed 
in the slices immediately above and below, at the same transverse location.

  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 • The average SUV within the volume encompassed by [CONTACT_668561].  This approach for definition of ROIs has been successfully 
used for assessment of tumor response in patients with advanced NSCLC 63.   
• In most patients the primary tumor will show the highest FDG uptake.  However, in a 
small subgroup of participants the primary tumor may be small (< 2cm) and show only 
low FDG uptake in PET or it may have been resected.  In this case, the metastatic lesion 
with the highest FDG uptake will be used for analysis.   
• For quality control purposes, a large circular ROI (diameter >= 5 cm) will be placed in 
normal liver tissue.  The mean SUV in this ROI will be recorded. 
• In the case of multiple liver metastases, it may not be feasible to place one large ROI in 
normal liver tissues.  In this case, several small ROIs, including the same number of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_668506] 5-cm ROI, may be placed in normal liver tissue.  FDG uptake within these 
lesions will be averaged and used for further analysis. 
• If the mean SUV within the liver changes by [CONTACT_726] 1.0 between two scans, the SUV 
calculation will be checked for errors.  Specifically, the scanner cross calibration, the 
decay correction of the injected activity, and the participant's body weight will be 
checked (see checklist below for details) 
 
6. Image Interpretation 
• Describe the location of the primary tumor and of metastatic lesions if present. 
• Measure and record the maximum SUV in the primary tumor and most active metastatic 
lesion.   
• If the diameter of the primary tumor is less than [ADDRESS_902940] FDG 
uptake. 
• Measure and record the mean SUV in the liver as described in Section 5  above.

Acquisition and Analysis of the CT Scans 
The CT scans serve three purposes: (a) attenuation correction and registration with PET scans for 
anatomic localization of FDG uptake; (b) response assessment using RECIST; and (c) high 
spatial quality data sets for central volumetric analyses of lung lesions.  Depending upon 
considerations of workflow and the need for intravenous contrast, individual institutions may 
have different processes for completing the chest CT scans used for RECIST and tumor 
volumetric assessments.  The following are potential scenarios:

scan, including the PET/CT scanner, and one single inspi[INVESTIGATOR_668507].

All CT scans for an individual participant should be performed on the same platform throughout 
the trial.  In the rare instance of equipment malfunction, follow-up scans on an individual 
participant can be performed on the same type  of platform.  
 
Each scanner platform has slightly different technical specifications and user inputs for imaging 
parameters.  The following table provides specifications for the acquisition and reconstruction 
parameters for the CT series  performed for tumor volumetry.

All measurements will be taken and recorded in metric notation on a calibrated diagnostic 
imaging workstation at full resolution using electronic calipers.  The baseline measurements will 
be performed within one week of the start of treatment; measurements obtained following

APPENDIX D -Correlative Studies 
 
Background 
 
The mainstay of treatment for patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) has unfortunately 
not advanced over the last several years. Outside of local disease control, which includes surgery 
and radiotherapy, systemic therapy has not demonstrated significant benefit in terms of either 
response rate or overall survival. Studies have shown that ACC genomes are characterized by 
[CONTACT_668564] (79). In addition recent 
studies have started to catalog the mutational landscape of these genomes (80). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668515], there is an urgent need to study the genomic basis of therapeutic benefit 
(response and stable disease rates) and clinical behaviors of this disease. In order to address this 
current unmet need, we are proposing a novel study of ACC genomes in patients who have been 
treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA).  
 
[CONTACT_668574] (TGen) has recently validated the use of DNA content-based sorting 
strategies with clinical FFPE samples. These methods allow the identification and purification of 
distinct and pure populations of tumor cells from each sample of interest. In addition, TGen has 
optimized methods to use the DNA from each sorted population for whole genome and whole 
exome analysis, and we have established a highly efficient pi[INVESTIGATOR_668516] (NGS) data and to extract clinically actionable results from patient samples during 
clinical trials.  
 
HR23B was identified as a candidate cancer biomarker through a genome-wide loss-of-function 
screen (81). It sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to HDAC inhibitor-dependent cell death. Depletion 
of HR23B in CTCL (cutaneous T cell lymphoma) cell lines reduced sensitivity to apoptosis of 
these cells upon SAHA treatment (add pearsson ref). Skin biopsies from patients with CTCL 
enrolled in a SAHA phase [ADDRESS_902949] treatment quantitative HR23B 
levels (82) The total staining score (TSS) was compared to clinical response. The positive 
predictive value of HR23B in this clinical setting was 68.8%. Lack of response or progression of 
disease also correlated with initial absence or disappearance of HR23B in pre and post-treatment 
biopsies respectively.  
 
Specific Aims 
 
The fundamental hypothesis of our study is that distinct genomic aberrations including 
amplifications, mutations, and gene translocations that target specific genes and signaling 
pathways will distinguish those tumors that had a meaningful response to SAHA. We propose 
that our comprehensive study of the genomic landscape of this patient population, specifically 
looking at the differences in therapeutic benefit, will provide a unique data set that can be 
exploited for advancing effective targeted therapy for patients with disease. To accomplish our 
study we will complete the following Aims:

  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902950] somatic events in each of the patient subsets. 
 
Methods  FFPE Sample Preparation and Flow Sorting:  Excess paraffin is removed with a 
scalpel from individual 40-60µm scrolls which are then washed with 1ml Xylene for 5 minutes 
to remove remaining paraffin.  Each sample is rehydrated in sequential ethanol washes (100% 5 
minutes x2, then 95%, 70%, 50% and 30% ethanol) and washed 2 times in 1ml 1mM EDTA pH 
8.0. A 1ml aliquot of 1mM EDTA pH 8.0 is added to the samples which are then incubated at 
95oC for 80 minutes to facilitate the removal of protein cross-links.  Samples are cooled to room 
temperature for > 5 minutes, followed by [CONTACT_68016] 300µl PBS 7.4 and gentle centrifugation for 
2 minutes.  The pellet is washed 3 times with 1ml PBS 7.4/0.5mM CaCl2 to remove EDTA. 
Each sample is digested overnight (6-17 hours) in 1ml of enzymatic cocktail containing 50 
units/ml of collagenase type 3, 80 units/ml of purified collagenase, and 100 units/ml of 
hyaluronidase in PBS ph7.4/0.5mM CaCl2 buffer. Following overnight digestion 500µl NST 
buffer is added and samples are centrifuged for [ADDRESS_902951]/10% fetal bovine serum and then passed through a 25g needle 10-
[ADDRESS_902952]/10% fetal bovine serum 
and placed on ice while processing remaining samples.  An equal volume of 20µg/ml DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_668517] a final concentration of 10µg/ml DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_668518] (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Optimal 
settings for sorting FFPE samples are: Drop formation is achieved with pi[INVESTIGATOR_668519] 6-10 
volts and a drop frequency of 30khertz. The sort mode is set to purity yield with a drop delay of 
31.5-32. Sheath fluid pressure is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 17-18psi with a 100µm nozzle. For single parameter 
DNA content assays DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_668520] > 450nm. DNA content and cell cycle are 
then analyzed using the software program MultiCycle (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). 
 
DNA Extraction and Amplification:  DNA from sorted nuclei is extracted using an amended 
protocol for QIAamp® DNA Micro Kit from Qiagen.  Briefly each sorted sample is resuspended 
in 180µl buffer ATL and 20µl proteinase K, and then incubated for 3 hours at 56°C for complete 
lysis.  Samples are bound and washed according to supplier's instructions, eluted into 50µl of 
H20, and then precipi[INVESTIGATOR_668521] 5ul sodium acetate and 180µl 100% EtOH.  Each 
sample is then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 x g, washed in 1ml of 70% EtOH for 30 
minutes at 20,000 x g. The DNA pellet is dried then resuspended in a small volume (e.g. 10-
75  NCI Protocol #: 8474 
  Local Protocol #: 2009-165 
  Version Date: 08/16/16 
 50µl) of H 20 for final concentrations suitable for accurate quantization. Genomic DNA from 
sorted FFPE samples is amplified using Ovation® WGA FFPE System (NuGEN® Technologies, 
San Carlos CA) with an alternate fragmentation step.  Resulting amplified products are used as 
template for aCGH. In all cases the amplification product quality is assessed by [CONTACT_570978]. 
 
Array CGH:  For each flow sorted tumor sample of interest we will label 1 µg of tumor DNA and 
1 µg of reference DNA according to our published protocols (83). These will be hybridized to 
Agilent 60mer oligonucleotide CGH arrays. All microarray slides will be scanned using an 
Agilent 2565C DNA microarray scanner. Microarray images will be analyzed using Agilent 
Feature Extraction software version 11.0 (FE 11.0) using default settings according to the 
supplier’s recommendations. Log 2 ratios of fluorescent signals and corresponding log 2 ratio 
errors, as calculated from the log 10 output of FE 11.0, will be analyzed in Genome Workbench 
6.7. All aCGH experiments will be evaluated using a series of quality control (QC) metrics. 
These include background noise, signal intensities and signal to noise ratios for each dye-specific 
channel, the reproducibility of a series of replicate control probes on the arrays, and a measure of 
the spread of the distribution of the log 2 ratios reported in each experiment. The data from arrays 
that pass the QC metrics will then be analyzed using an aberration detection algorithm (ADM2) 
(84). The latter identifies all aberrant intervals in a given sample with consistently high or low 
log ratios based on the statistical score derived from the average normalized log ratios of all 
probes in the genomic interval multiplied by [CONTACT_668565]. 
Aberration calling thresholds for ADM2 will be determined based on hybridizations with normal 
46XY and 46XX DNA derived from sorted control tissues. We will use the distribution of log [ADDRESS_902953] the statistical threshold for 
calling aberrant genomic intervals in the PDA samples.  
 
NGS Template and Exome Sampling:  For each sample of interest we will generate double 
stranded (ds) DNA template using our published methods and the Ovation® WGA FFPE System 
(85). Each sample selected for NGS will be assayed for final QC metrics including size range 
and concentration of dsDNA prior to exome sampling and sequencing. Patient matched germline 
DNAs will be processed in parallel. All exome sampling and NGS data generation will be done 
in TGen’s Collaborative Sequencing Center (CSC).  
 
NGS Analyses Workflow:  Once exome sequencing data is generated, we will leverage our 
substantial bioinformatics and statistics skills, experience, and large-scale computational 
capabilities to carry out research-objective-specific customized data-analyses. We have several 
automated workflows that consist of both published and internally developed data analyses tools 
for processing sequenced data to generate interpretation-ready results. This includes germline 
results, such as detecting variants, comparisons with a variety of publically available variants 
datasets (e.g., dbSNP, 1000 genomes, etc.), functional annotation, Ti/Tv ratios, target sequencing 
efficiency, etc. Further, when both tumor and normal sequencing data is available, we have well-
tested sophisticated workflows for somatic variant detection with detailed comparisons with 
publically available datasets (e.g., COSMIC). Both germline and somatic variants are 
comprehensively annotated for functional consequences, such as non-synonymous mutations,

  Version Date: 08/16/[ADDRESS_902954], platform-
independent input sequencing data format (e.g., FASTQ format), generate detailed QC and 
several additional statistical metrics at various stages of data processing, and deliver results that 
conform to standard output formats, such as BAM (alignments), VCF (variant calls), functional 
annotation, etc.  
 
HR23B protein levels will be measured by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) using published 
protocols (86). We will use a single thin section slide for all IHC experiments. All assays will be 
done through TGen’s Macromolecular Analyte and Processing Center (MAPC) pending 
additional funding. In addition a second slide from each patient will be used for further 
validation of the recurring t(6:9) MYB-NFIB translocation using conventional fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FISH) (87). A semiquantitative analysis based upon intensity and frequency of 
HR23B staining and the type of dermal and epi[INVESTIGATOR_668522](87). A total staining score (TSS) will be determined out of 13, where a score of greater 
than or equal to 6 will be considered to be strong HR23B staining. The threshold for 
differentiating between positive and negative immunostaining will be set at at TSS of equal or 
higher than 6. This optimal cutoff was determined by [CONTACT_668566] 
(ROC) distribution analysis. 
 
Samples 
B
arbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) has a set of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
(FFPE) tumor slides/blocks from individual ACC patients who were treated with SAHA. A high 
number of patients had stable disease on treatment over 1 year (median and range), and we 
observed partial responses in two of the patients in this trial. These FFPE samples are well 
annotated with clinical follow-up and represent highly favorable samples to exploit for 
advancing improved outcomes in ACC. 
This study will use previously collected FFPE tissue blocks from 10 patients; 5 patients who 
achieved durable benefit from SAHA and 5 patients whose tumors did not demonstrate 
therapeutic response. If an entire FFPE block is not available, PI's will request up to 20 unstained

• BioRad BioPlex Cell Lysis Kit (BioRad, Cat # 171-304011) 
 
Procedures  
Blood Collection 
1. Samples will be collected into 1BD Vacutainer CPT tube with sodium heparin. These will be 
kept at room temperature (18-26oC) and properly labeled with patient information and study 
number. . 
2.  Once blood is collected, the tubes will be inverted approximately 8-10 times to ensure that 
the whole blood is mixed thoroughly with the anticoagulant. 
3. The tubes will be centrifuged within 2 hr of collection at room temperature for 30 min at 
1700 RCF (relative centrifugal force). 
 
 
Note: The tube will be checked to be in the proper centrifuge adapter.  Excessive 
centrifuge speed (over 2000 RCF) may cause tube breakage, exposure to blood and 
possible injury.  To calculate the correct centrifuge speed for a given RCF, the following 
formula is used: 
 
   
The variable “r” is the radial distance in centimeters from the centrifuge center post to the 
tube bottom, when the tube is positioned horizontally. RCF is the desired relative 
centrifugal force, 1700 in this case. (2.5cm = 1 inch). 
4. After centrifugation, mononuclear cells and platelets will be in a whitish layer just under the 
plasma layer (see below figure).

APPENDIX I: THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE ASSESSMENT USING VOLUMETRIC 
DENSITY 
 
Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences investigator [CONTACT_668576] and colleagues will 
retrospectively evaluate CT and/or MRI of patients treated in the current trial. These cross 
sectioning imaging (CT/MR) have already been obtained. No new imaging will be performed. 
 
All the CTs and/or MRI will be evaluated at the National Cancer Institute, under [CONTACT_668575] and 
colleagues.   
 
All pre-specified target lesions will be assessed at specific time-points: baseline, date of best 
response, a mid-treatment time point and most recent imaging.  
 
The specific aims are to:  
1. Retrospectively compare VTV (all lesions; volume/density) vs. pre-determined RECIST (axial 
only)  
2. Correlate VTV, RECIST, and treatment response (partial response, progressive disease, stable 
disease and stable disease over 6 months) 
 
Registration and Lesion Management Application (algorithm/ software):  
Automated registration and semi-automatic segmentation of all target lesions will be performed 
on serial CT scans or MRI using PACS (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_115303]) . 
 
Lesion Management Algorithm radiology imaging software (Carestream vue PACS v12, 
[COMPANY_002]ster, NY).  
First, each scan is manually opened and globally registered to align axial planes between the two 
scans. The global registration algorithm employs a fully automated volumetric voxel-based rigid 
registration algorithm.1 Second, tumors are manually located, which is performed by [CONTACT_668569], or by [CONTACT_48775] a measurement markup across conglomerated or abutting 
lesions. The PACS software then performs a refined registration by [CONTACT_668570]

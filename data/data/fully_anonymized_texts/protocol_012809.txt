142. Introduction
This ISA OA01 is an appendix to the master protocol CPMP and contains unique study  elements 
specific for LY3016859 . The m aster protocol  contains the overarching study  elements that 
govern the OA DSA CPMP(1) and this ISA OA01.  
LY3016859 is a high affinit y humanized immunoglo bulin G (IgG)4 monocl onal ant ibody  that 
binds to key  residues in the C -terminal regio ns of transforming growth factor -α(TGF -α) and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], preventing their binding to the e pi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR).  
Engagement of LY3016859 results in internalizat ion of the membrane -spanning ligands and 
neutralizat ion of mature ligand activit y in vitro .  
The EGFR and epi[INVESTIGATOR_77111] (Martin et al. 2017).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_77112]/insult (Martin et al. 2017).  Inhibit ion of EGFR with 
clinically available compound s strongly reduces nocifensive behavior in mouse models of 
inflammatory  and chronic pain, including spi[INVESTIGATOR_77113]
(Martin et al. 2017) .
TGF -α has also been implicated in so me chronic pain condit ions, especially  with pain in OA.  
For instance, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of TGF -α has been associated with 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_590780] (Cui et al .2017), and in 1reported case study  
(Moryl et al .2006) a l ung cancer patient receiving treatm ent wi th the EGFR ty rosine kinase 
inhibitor gefit inib reported a marked improvement in her OAsymptom s.  The reported pain 
relief persisted while on treatment ,but painful symptoms returned when treatment was 
discontinued due to intolerance ofEGFR inhibitor associated side effects .
Non-controlled reports show that EGFR inhibit ion

relief o f pain ( Kersten et at. 2013; Kersten et al. 2015; Juhasz et al. 2013); and the pain relief was 
independent of diseas e progressi on (Kersten and Cam eron 2012).  
2.1. Study Rationale
The purpose of this study  is to test whether LY3016859 is efficacious in relieving knee pain due 
toOA.  Data will be collected to assess the safet y and tol erabilit y of LY3016859 in this study  
population. Pharmacokinet ic (PK)properti es, pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and 
immunogenicit y profile will  also be expl ored.  The totalit y of data fro m this proof -of concept 
study will assess the benefit s and risksassociated wi thLY3016859 and inform  decisio nsfor the

the site com pletes the OA01 baseline procedures and sample co llection 
participants receive their first dose of study  intervent ionvia IV infusio n over 1 hour 
the site observes part icipants in the clinic for at least 4 hours after the completion o f the 
IV infusio n 
the site com plete s all post -treatm ent sam ple collectio n and safety  monitoring , and
the site instructs participants to continue with study  restri ctions and Numeric Rat ing 
Scale (NRS )diary entri es before thei r visit discharge .
At Visits 4 through 6
the site revi ews available safet y data and com pletes pre -dose procedures and sample 
collect ion
participants receive an IV infusio n over 1 hour 
the site observes part icipants in the clinic for at least 4 hours after the completion o f the 
IV infusio n
the site com pletes all post- treatm ent sam ple collectio n and safety  monitoring , and
the site instructs participants to continue with study  restri ctions and NRS diary  entries 
before their visit discharge .
At Visit 7
the site com pletes all procedures and sample co llection noted in the SoA s

Protocol  SoA and Visit [ADDRESS_778712] 
administrati on of  intervent ion to characterize the safety and clinical immunogenicit yprofile.
4.2. Justification for Dose
The proposed dose for proof -of-concept i s a 750 -mg starting dose fo llowed by 500 mg every  
2weeks IV for a total of 4 doses.  The dose level and durati on are based on the available 
toxicology, safet y, PK and PD data fro m the com pleted studi esdetailed in the LY3016859 IB. 
Briefly, the proposed dose regimen maintains an approximate 10
-fold margin o f safety  (MOS) 
relative to the no-observed -adverse -effect l evel (NOAEL) for both rat and monkey  repeated dose 
toxicology studi es (Table 4.5 in the IB) and is expected to achieve steady state exposure similar 
to the [ADDRESS_778713] parti cipant.

246.1.1. Special Treatment Considerations
[IP_ADDRESS]. Premedication for Infusions
Prem edicat ion for infusio ns is not pl anned.  However, if an infusion react ion occurs, the study  
investigator(s ) should determine the appropri ate premedication for subsequent infusio ns for that 
participant .
The invest igator sand sponsor may decide to usepremedicat ion for all participants.  They  will 
decide this if the frequency of infusio n reactions amo ng participants warrants it .
Any premedicat ions given will be documented as a concomitant therapy  (see Secti on6.5).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Infusion Reactions
All participants shoul d be m onitored cl osely , asthere is a risk of infusio n reaction and 
hypersensit ivity (incl uding anaphylaxis) with any bi ological  agent.  
Symptoms and Signs
Symptom s and si gns that m ay occur as part of an infusio n reaction include, but are not limited to 
fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema, throat irritation, rash, 
pruri tus, myalgia, and dizziness.  
Site Needs
The clinical site shoul d have necessary  equipment and medicat ions for the m anagement of any 
infusio n reaction, which may include but is not limited to oxy gen, IV fluid, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
acetaminophen and ant ihistamine.
Management of Infusion Reaction s
Invest igators should grade the severit y of the infusio n reaction andmanage infusio n react ions 
based on standard of care and their clinical  judgment .  If an infusio n reaction occurs, then 
supportive care should be used in accordance with the signs and symptoms.
This table outl ines guidance when a mild to moderate infusio n reaction occurs.
If… Then…
a mild to moderate infusion reaction occurs the infusion rate should be slowed or stopped depending 
on the symptoms or signs present.
For example, reducing the rate by 50% from 
2 mL/minute to 1 mL/ minute .
the infusion rate is slowed the infusion should be completed at the slower rate, 
as tolerated.
subsequent infusions may be administered at the 
discretio n of the investigator in agreement with the 
Lilly  medical monitor. 
the inf usion rate is slowed, and subsequent infusions are 
continuedthe infusion rate must be maintained at the slowest 
tolerated rate used. 
CONFIDENTIAL Master Protocol Number H0P -MC-CPMP ISA:H0P-MC-OA01 (a)
25The s tudy intervent ion infusio n shoul d be stopped immediately  and perm anent ly if it isan

with systemic invo lvement, including, but not limited to significant treatment emergent 
hypotension, bronchospasm, or wide -spread urti caria 
that does not respond to a slower infusion rate or oral medications
that is determined as clinically  significant by [CONTACT_17062].  
If a participant permanent ly discontinues from  study  intervent ion, they  shoul dcomplete AE
monitoring and other procedures as stated in Section 4, Study  Design, and the CPMP and OA01 
SoAs.
6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
Study  intervent ion and placebo require refrigerat ion.
Study  intervent ion and placebo will be prepared an d verified by [CONTACT_104457].

No addi tional stratificat ion factors are considered for this ISA.  
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Participants will receive study  intervent ion directly fro m the invest igator or designee, under 
medical supervisio n.  The date and time of each study  intervent ionadministered in the clinic will 
be recorded in the source documents and case report form ( CRF ).  Ad ministration of intervent ion
and study  parti cipant i dentification will  be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the 
study  site staff other than the person administering the study  interventi on.  
6.5. Concomitant Therapy
All conco mitant therapi [INVESTIGATOR_590782], are 
allowed and can be used during the study , ifit is permitted based on the inclusio n and exclusio n 
criteria.

8.2. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
8.2.1. Infusion Site Reactions
Symptom s of a l ocal infusi on site reacti on may  include ery thema, indurat ion, pain, pruritus, and 
edem a.If an infusio n site event is reported, the AE will be recorded, and additional data will be 
provi ded to the sponsor in the CRF.
Addit ional blood and urine samples should be co llected as described in OA01 Secti on 10.3, 
Appendix 3, “Recommended Laboratory  Test ing for Hy persensi tivity Events”.   Laboratory 
resul ts are provi ded to the sponsor vi a the central  laboratory .
8.2.2. Hypersensitivity Reactions and Infusion -related Reactions
Many  drugs, but parti cularly biologic agents ,carry the ri sk of systemic hypersensit ivity 
reacti ons. Drugs administered via IV infusio n may lead to a sy stemic infusio n-related reacti on. 
If such a react ion occurs, a dditional data describi ng each symptom  shoul d be provi dedto the 
sponsor in the CRF.  
Sites shoul d have appropri ately  trained medical  staff and appropri ate medical equipment 
available when study  parti cipants are receiving study  intervent ion. It is recommended that 
participants who experience a systemic reaction be treated per the local standard of care .  
In the case of generalized urticaria oranaphylaxis ,or moderate to severe infusio n-related 
reacti ons, additional bl ood and urine samples should be collected as described in OA01

Laboratory  resul ts are provi ded to the sponsor via the c entral  laboratory .
8.2.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Dermatological adverse reactions
EGFR ant ibodies or EGFR -associ ated ty rosine kinase inhibitors are associated with various 
derm atological AEs, including acn eiform  rashes, xerosis, pruri tis, and photosensit ivity. 
Secondary  infect ion can also develop. 
Parti cipants shoul d usesun protecti onduring the study  period. Dermatological adverse reaction s
shoul d be managed by [CONTACT_77130]. Discont inuat ion of 
treatm ent m ay be considered if theseAEs do not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_590783]
(>30% body  surface area) or are severe.
If any o f these AEs are reported, sites will be prompted to provide additional informat ion. 
Renal Function
Changes in eGFR were observed in pa rticipan ts with di abetic nephropathy  in Study TGAB
(Secti on2.2). Such changes were reversible and were not associ ated wi th increase in proteinuria .  
Blood and urine samples will be collected to characterize the effects of LY3016859 on renal 
funct ionand eGFR will be mo nitored during the study .
8.3. Treatment of Overdose
In case of suspected overdose, participants should be mo nitored for any  signs or symptom s of 
adverse reactions or effects, and supportive care should be provided as necessary. 
8.4. Pharmacokinetic s

309. Statistical Considerations
The m aster protocol  and OA DSA provide statist ical considerat ions.  LY3016859 specific 
considerations are described here. 
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses
The m aster protocol  CPMP describes the primary  hypothesis.
 
 
The key  secondary  null hypothesis is that there is no difference between LY3016859 and pl acebo 
on the key secondary endpo int, the mean change from baseline to endpoint for the WOMAC® 
Pain Subscale Score.  
 
9.2. Sample Size Determination
Approximately  125 pa rticipantswill be rando mized in a 2:1 rati o toLY3016859 and placebo , 
respectively .It is expected that approximately 107
participant swill co mpletethe doubl e-blind 
treatm ent peri od of  the study . 
 
 
 If the re is
no treatment difference between placebo and LY3016859 , the probabilit y of passing the efficacy  
criterion specified above (i .e., falsepositive) i s approximately  0.1. The simulat ion for the power 
calculat ion and sample size determinati on was carried out in FACTS Version 6.0.
9.3. Populations for Analyses
The populat ions are defined in protocol CPMP.
The pharmacokinet ic popu lation includes all randomized participants who received a full dose of 
LY3016859 at Visit [ADDRESS_778721] ificat ion for making the change, will be described in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP)and the clinical study  report.  Addi tional expl oratory  analyses of the data will be

[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity
Treatment -emergent ADAs are defined as participants
with a 2-fold (1 dilution) increase in t iter than the minimum requ ired dilut ion if no ADAs 
were detected at baseline (treatment -induced ADA) or 
with a 4-fold (2 dilutions) increase in titer compared with baseline if ADAs were detected 
at baseline (treatment -boosted ADA).
The frequency and percentage of participants withpreexist ing ADA and who are TE -ADA 
positive (TE -ADA+) to LY3016859 will be tabulated.   
If neutralizing ant ibodies are assessed, the distributio n of titers and frequency  of neutralizing 
antibodies for the TE -ADA+ participant smay also be tabulated.
The relationship between the presence of ant ibodies and PK parameters ,PD response ,safet y or
efficacy  to LY3016859, may also be assessed. Additional details may be provi ded in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Pharmacokinet ic and pharmaco kinet ic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) analyses maybe conducted to 
explore the exposure -response relat ionships for various pharmacodynamics measures. The
analys es will be perform edusing popul ation analysis software, NONMEM, if data all ows. The 
versio n of any  software used for the analysis will be documented, and the program will meet the 
Lilly requirements of software validat ion. It is possible that other validated, equivalent PK

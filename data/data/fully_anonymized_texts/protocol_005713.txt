1.0 * Study Name:  
[CONTACT_216902] a home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program on muscle function and quality of life 
following acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
2.0 * Brief Description (using layman's terms) - 500 words or less:  
COPD impacts a significant proportion of the veteran population. Acute exacerbations, or flare -ups, of 
COPD are associated with impaired muscle function and worse quality of life. Pulmonary reha bilitation, a 
formal exercise program for patients with lung disease that includes both endurance and strength training 
exercises, has been shown to improve muscle function and quality of life after an acute exacerbation of 
COPD. However, lack of geographi cally accessible rehabilitation facilities and/or transportation issues are 
often barriers to pulmonary rehabilitation attendance in the veteran population. This study will assess the 
feasibility and impact of an intention to treat, eight -week, three sessi ons per week, home -based, 
pulmonary telerehabilitation program in veterans with COPD following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216818]. We will measure adherence and satisfaction with the program and 
muscle strength, physical activi ty, quality of life, and exercise tolerance pre and post -intervention in 
veterans randomized to the pulmonary telerehabilitation arm versus veterans randomized to the control 
arm who do not participate in pulmonary rehabilitation.

* Abstract.   Please provide a brief description of the study . 
 
Pulmonary telerehabilitation programs have been shown to have a high acceptance and adherence rate and 
lead to improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life in stable COPD. However, data regarding the 
feasibility and impact of pulmonary telerehabili tation following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216829], muscle function, exercise capacity, and health -related quality of life are lacking. Our primary 
hypothesis is that a home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program initiated at ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_216830], exercise capacity, and health -related quality of life compared to 
usual care. We will test  this hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) To determine the feasibility of 
an eight -week home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program in veterans with moderate to severe COPD 
initiated in the immediate post -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216831] a n AECOPD. (2) To determine physical 
activity levels and the magnitude and variability in changes of measurements of muscle strength, functional 
exercise performance, and health -related quality of life following an eight -week home -based pulmonary 
telerehabi litation program versus usual care initiated in veterans with moderate to severe COPD 
immediately following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216832]. We will randomize (1:1 allocation) 30 male and female 
veterans hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216833] -week, t hree sessions per week, home -based 
pulmonary telerehabilitation program that includes lower extremity endurance exercises with a cycle 
ergometer and upper and lower extremity strength training with 1:[ADDRESS_260644] of pulmonary telerehabilitation on long -term clinical 
outcomes following AECOPD.  
3.0 * Describe the study objectives. Please include primary aim and hypothesis, if applicable any 
secondary aims and h ypotheses.  
A pulmonary telerehabilitation program provides a home -based option for patients unable or unwilling to 
participate in a traditional, center -based program. Studies have demonstrated that home -based pulmonary 
telerehabilitation programs are feasi ble, positively impact exercise endurance and quality of life measures, 
and are widely -accepted by [CONTACT_216871] . However,  little is 
known regarding the feasibility or impact on physical activity, muscle f unction, exercise performance, and 
quality of life measures of a home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program initiated immediately 
following an AECOPD . Consequently, we propose a two -year pi[INVESTIGATOR_216834] a home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program on physical activity levels, muscle strength, 
exercise performance, and quality of life measures in veterans with COPD following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216835]. Our aims include:  
  
SA 1: To determine the feasibility of an eight -week home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation 
program in veterans with moderate to severe COPD initiated in the immediate post -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216836].   Hypothesis: An eight -week home -based pulmonary 
telerehabilita tion program will have a high acceptance and adherence rate among veterans with moderate 
to severe COPD following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216832].  We will track adherence to a home -based 
pulmonary telerehabilitation program consisting of eight weeks, three sessions per week of 1:[ADDRESS_260645] o r another staff member via teleconferencing. 
A satisfaction survey will be administered at the completion of the intervention. We will also assess factors 
(i.e. psychiatric attributes, social support) associated with adherence to obtain preliminary insight s to 
optimize recruitment for a larger, randomized controlled trial.  
  
SA 2: To determine physical activity levels and the magnitude and variability in changes of 
measurements of muscle strength, functional exercise performance, and health -related quality 
of life following an eight -week home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program versus usual 
care initiated in veterans with moderate to severe COPD immediately following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216837].  
Hypothesis: Participants randomized to an eight -week, three times per week pulmonary telerehabilitation 
program will demonstrate increased physical activity levels and greater improvement in maximal handgrip 
and quadriceps muscle strength, six minute walk, one -minute sit -to-stand testing, and health -related 
quality of life scores at completion of the intervention compared to participants randomized to usual 
care. We will compare changes from baseline in physical activity levels measured by [CONTACT_216872], maximal 
handgrip and quadriceps muscle strength, six minute walk, one -minute sit -to-stand repetitions, and St. 
George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_216838] -Form [ADDRESS_260646] size and variance of these measurements will be used for the 
statistical planning (i.e. sample size and power calculations) of a larger, randomized controlled trial.  
4.0 * Provide a summary of the backgr ound of the study, and explain how this research will 
contribute to existing knowledge.   Describe previous studies that provides a basis to show that 
the proposed research can be carried out without undue risk to human subjects.   
Chronic obstructive pulmon ary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002] and 
is highly prevalent in the aging veteran population. Health care costs in COPD are largely attributable to 
acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), defined as an increase in short ness of breath, cough, and/or 
sputum production that is beyond typi[INVESTIGATOR_5707] -to-day variability and usually requires a change in medication. 
In addition to loss of lung function, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality, AECOPD are 
associated with reduced physical activity, muscle dysfunction, and poorer health -related quality of life. 
Muscle loss and dysfunction have, in turn, been associated with increased mortality in patients with COPD. 
Outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation initiated in the immedi ate post -exacerbation period has been shown to 
have a positive impact on muscle  
function, exercise endurance, and health -related quality of life. As such, consensus guidelines recommend 
the participation in a pulmonary rehabilitation program within three t o four weeks of an acute exacerbation 
of COPD. However, efforts to initiate outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation in the post -exacerbation period are 
often hindered by [CONTACT_216873], limited patient access to pulmonary rehabilitation facilities,  or 
low patient motivation. A home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program initiated at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216839]. Pulmonary telerehabilitation programs have been shown to be safe, have a 
high acceptance and adherence rate, and le ad to improvement in exercise capacity and quality of life in 
stable COPD. However, data regarding the feasibility and impact of pulmonary telerehabilitation following 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216840], muscle function, exercise cap acity, and health -
related quality of life are lacking.  
5.0 * Describe the overall significance of the research in terms of the problem to be studied and 
potential findings, as well as its relevance to the care of veterans, the VAPHS, and the VHA:  
COPD is prevalent and associated with high health care utilization and costs in the veteran 
population. As of 2014, 52% of the veterans seeking care within the VA system were [ADDRESS_260647]

* Research Procedures/Interventions:  
 
Study Interventions:  
Pulmonary Telerehabilitation Intervention Group:  The intervention will consist of an eight -week, three 
sessions per week, home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation program that will incorporate both lo wer 
extremity endurance exercise and upper and lower extremity resistance training.  Subjects randomized to 
the study intervention will also participate in a optional  once monthly support group via group 
phone call through a reserved VANTS line. This phone conferencing  consisting of an educational 
topic (i.e. inhaler use, understanding COPD) and group discussion.  Participants randomized to the 
intervention arm will receive a tablet with VA Video Connect software installed for video conferencing, a 
portable c ycle ergometer, and a set of exercise resistance bands of varying resistance (extra -light, light, 
medium, heavy, extra -heavy).   Patients will also be given an pedometer at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216841]’s ph ysical activity.   Patients will receive 
a pedometer diary from study staff to record  their daily steps from the pedometer.   We also 
contact [CONTACT_216874].  They will be permitted to 
keep the pedometer, cy cle ergometer and resistance  bands, at the completion of the study.  
    
For safety purposes, participants in both the intervention and usual care group will also be enrolled in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s telehealth program, which consists of daily monitoring of pulse oximetry, heart rate, blood 
pressure, and weight  and regular contact [CONTACT_4490] a telehealth provider. They will receive a pulse oximeter, 
automated blood pressure cuff, and scale  as part of this program. An exercise physiologist  will meet with 
participants rand omized to the intervention group prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216842] a minimum of one to  two face -to-face inpatient bedside pulmonary rehabilitation 
sessions. These sessions will be used to guide development of an individualized exercise prescription, 
determine participant oxygen requirements with exercise, and to assess participant safety.  Within one 
to six weeks post -discharge, participants in the intervention arm will begin pulmonary tele 
rehabilitation  sessions via 1:[ADDRESS_260649]/study coordinator. The 
exercise physiologist/study coordinator  will be located at VAPHS during these video conferencing sessions. 
These sessions will consist of:  (1) a brief pre -exercise interview t o assess symptoms and vital signs (pulse 
oximetry, pulse, blood pressure);  (2) a warm -up period consisting of upper and lower extremity stretching 
exercises;  (3) cycle ergometry with resistance settings and goal duration determined by [CONTACT_216875][INVESTIGATOR_2345];  (4) upper and lower extremity strength training 
with resistance bands;  (5) a post -exercise debriefing interview to assess symptoms and post -exercise vital 
signs. Subjects will be offered the opportunity  to enroll in a traditional facility -based pulmonary 
rehabilitation program.   
Usual Care Group:   Participants randomized to the usual care arm will also be enrolled in our institution’s 
telehealth program, will receive an automatic blood pressure monitor, portable pulse oximeter, and 
scale.   Patients randomized to Usual Care  will also be given an pedometer at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216843]’s physical activity.   Patients will 
receive a pedometer diary  from study staff to record  their daily steps from the pedometer.  We 
also contact [CONTACT_216874].  They will be permitted 
to keep the pedometer at the completion of the study.  
Participants will be in regul ar contact [CONTACT_4490] a telehealth provider. A study team member will meet with 
participants randomized to the usual care arm prior to discharge but after informed consent is obtained to 
discuss the importance of exercise and will encourage exercise (strength tr aining, light aerobic activity such 
as walking or cycling) a minimum of [ADDRESS_260650] the study team to discuss withdrawal from study  participation.  
Development of the Initial Exercise Prescription:  The exercise prescription will be developed based on 
exercise performance and self -reported modified Borg dyspnea scores, a scale widely used in both the 
clinical and research setting to mea sure a patient’s perceived shortness of breath and effort, during the six 
minute walk and bedside pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. During the bedside sessions, the exercise 
physiologist/study coordinator  will select the resistance setting on the cycle er gometer that allows the 
participant to perform five minutes of lower extremity cycle ergometry while achieving Borg scale ratings 
between four and six in accordance with the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] 
(ERS) Guidelines. Alt ernatively, interval training, which has resulted in similar improvements in walk 
distance and quality of life scores, will be used for those participants unable to perform five minutes of 
cycle ergometry. During the resistance training exercises, the resi stance band workload that causes fatigue 
after eight to twelve repetitions will be selected for each target muscle group. Exercise performance during 
these bedside sessions combined with heart rate and exercise performance during six minute walk will be 
used to develop an individualized exercise prescription for home pulmonary telerehabilitation. [CONTACT_216932] 
will provide guidance as needed on developi[INVESTIGATOR_216844].  
Modification of the Exercise Prescription:  The ex ercise prescription will be adjusted during the eight -
week intervention to achieve modified Borg dyspnea scores of four to six during cycle ergometry and to 
target one to three sets of eight to twelve repetitions of each resistance training exercise per es tablished 
guidelines. The resistance band level will be increased when a participant is able to complete three sets of 
twelve repetitions using correct technique through the full range of motion. [CONTACT_216932] will provide 
guidance as needed on modification of the individualized exercise prescriptions throughout the eight -week 
intervention for each participant based on their performance. Other factors, including heart rate and blood 
pressure during exercise, will be considered when modifying the exercise pres criptions.  
Measurement of physical activity:  Participant activity will be measured with an pedometer 
provided at  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].    The pedometer  will be worn every day to track the participant’s 
physical activity.   
  
Safety and Oxygen Monitoring:  Oxyge n saturations will be continuously monitored during the six minute 
walk testing and inpatient bedside pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. Any participant demonstrating oxygen 
desaturations during these activities will undergo a formal exercise desaturation study to determine oxygen 
requirements prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In addition, vital signs will be monitored before, during, and after 
each beside pulmonary rehabilitation session. These sessions will allow investigators to assess participant 
safety with  exercise and to disqualify any participants that are unable to participate safely in endurance 
and/or resistance training. Finally, participants will be provided an automated blood pressure cuff and pulse 
oximeter to allow for intermittent monitoring of b lood pressure and continuous monitoring of oxygen 
saturation and heart rate during the home pulmonary telerehabilitation sessions. Prior studies have shown 
home -based pulmonary telerehabilitation programs to be safe, even in severe COPD. However, if the 
exercise physiologist has any concern with participant safety during the home -based telerehabilitation 
sessions, emergency services will be immediately contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Handgrip and quadriceps muscle strength testing:   Handgrip strength of the dominant hand will b e 
measured with a hand dynamometer. Three measurements will be taken with a 60 second recovery period 
between trials. The average maximal force across trials will be calculated as the final handgrip 
strength.  Quadriceps muscle maximal force (kilogram -force, kgf) will be measured with a Keiser leg press, 
equipment available in [CONTACT_173505]’s research center,  in those participants willing to return within 
approximately one week post -discharge for muscle strength measurements.  This test will be 
optional.  One rep etition maximum (1RM) measures will be obtained by [CONTACT_216876]. Peak muscle power will be measured 
at 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 percent of the 1RM 30 minutes a fter the 1RM measurement was obtained.   
  
Six Minute   Walk testing:   
 A six minute walk test will be performed by a study member. Data from the six minute walk test (distance walked, blood 
pressure and heart rate pre/post -procedure, symptoms pre, post-procedure) will be recorded on a de -identified study form, 
kept in the participant's de -identified study chart, and entered into the study data base. The six minute walk test is a 
validated, simple test that is responsive to changes in exercise enduran ce following pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD 
patients both during stable disease and following acute exacerbations.   Exercise capacity will be defined by [CONTACT_216877].   The six minute walk will be repeated following eight weeks of either the p ulmonary telerehabilitation intervention 
or usual care. Participants’ perception of dyspnea and exertion will be assessed at the end of the six minute walk testing 
with the ten point Borg dyspnea and leg fatigue scale, which ask about the degree of shortne ss of breath and leg fatigue. 
The six -minute walk test is an easy to perform and practical test that measures the distance that a patient can walk on a 
flat, hard surface in a period of six minutes.  
Sit-to-stand testing:   The one -minute sit -to-stand test h as been shown to be reliable, valid, and 
responsive to change in exercise capacity following pulmonary rehabilitation in individuals with COPD. The 
test consists of the participant standing at full leg extension from a sitting position at their own pace as  
often as possible during a one minute testing interval. The participant is permitted to stop at any time 
during the one minute interval if necessary. An armless chair is used for testing and the participant is asked 
to fold their arms across their chest d uring testing.  One test will be performed prior to discharge and 
another  sit to stand will be performed following eight weeks of either the pulmonary 
telerehabilitation intervention or usual care.  The participants’ perception of dyspnea and exertion will 
be assessed following each test with the ten point Borg dyspnea and leg fatigue scale.  
Health -related quality of life assessments:   Health -related quality of life will be assessed with the St. 
George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ) and the Short -Form 36 -Item Questionnaire (SF -36) prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216845]. The SGRQ is a disease -specific questionnaire validated to measure health status in patients with 
COPD. T otal SGRQ scores range from 0 -100 with higher scores indicating greater symptoms burden. The 
minimal clinically important difference is a difference of four points in the total SGRQ score. The SF -36 
consists of 36 questions spanning nine health domains and  is a valid measure of health -related quality of 
life in COPD that is responsive to change following a pulmonary rehabilitation intervention.  
Participant satisfaction survey:   Participants will be administered a survey by [CONTACT_216878] -week pulmonary telerehabilitation intervention that will require 
them to respond to statements related to their satisfaction with the home -based program using a five point 
Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly d isagree). Statements will address ease of 
use of the video conferencing modality, acceptability of exercise components, perceptions of impact on 
muscle strength and exercise endurance, and willingness to participate in additional pulmonary 
telerehabilitati on. Questions regarding social support, psychiatric attributes, and other factors potentially 
associated with program adherence will also be asked in order to gain preliminary insights to optimize 
recruitment for a larger, randomized controlled trial of pu lmonary telerehabilitation.

 Yes 
No 
  If yes, please specify and include a description of what the usual care or expected level of care is at VAPHS 
(e.g., medications, testing, timing, etc.) for patients, similar to those individuals that meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for this research study:  
Those participants who demonstrate oxygen desaturations during the bedside pulmonary telerehabilitation 
sessions or during any of the baseline study procedures will be referred for a formal home oxygen 
evaluation, which would be considered a usual care procedure for any patient demonstrating low oxygen 
levels.  
 
 
Pulmonary  rehabilitation is likewise considered standard of care for patients with COPD. This is traditionally 
performed in a facility -based setting, although a growing interest in pulmonary telerehabilitation has 
developed over the past several years, particularly  given the inaccessibility of facility -based programs to a 
large number of patients. VAPHS currently does not have a facility -based pulmonary rehabilitation 
program. We are working toward developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a pulmonary telerehabilitation program that we can offer our 
COPD patients but resources will be limited. Most COPD patients do not enroll in facility -based pulmonary 
rehabilitation programs in the weeks following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_216846].  
2.1  If Usual Care Procedures/Interventions wil l be used, who is the individual or entity responsible for relevant 
aspects of the usual care (i.e., which of the above usual care activities will the research study team be 
responsible for)?:  
The study team will be responsible for placing the inpatient co nsult for the home oxygen evaluation prior to 
discharge. The study team will be fully responsible for the inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation and 
pulmonary telerehabilitation sessions.

1.0 * Please describe the analysis plan for the study  (it is acceptable to refer to the sponsor/multi -site 
protocol for section if applicable):  
The distributional characteristics of the outcome measures and change in outcome measures 
between study groups will be determined using appropriate descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, median, 
standard deviation, range) and graphical summarizations (e.g. histograms, boxplots, line plots). The 
purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_216848] (i.e. sample size calculations and power analyses) of a 
larger, randomized controlled trial . As such, we acknowledge that, given our small sample size (n=30, 
15 participants per group), we likely will not have the power to detect a significant statistical or clinical 
difference in outcome measures between the intervention and usual care groups. However, we will 
perform exploratory analyses to compare changes in outcome measures between groups using a 
Student’s t -test or nonparametric tests when appropriate.

* Please provide a justification for the sample size:  
To meet our recruitment goal of 30 subjects over a one-year time interval, we will be required to enroll an 
average of 2 -3 participants per month. A review of our COPD admission data shows that the medicine 
service at the VAPHS admits a mean of 28.4 (SD 8.7, range 15 -43) patients per month with a primary 
diagnosis of COPD with acute exacerbation. Therefore, we anticipate no difficulty with recruitment for this 
study. We have not performed a sample size calculation given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_216850] a larger ran domized controlled trial (including data to calculate 
estimated sample size).

The participants will be undergoing an exercise intervention as well as muscle strength testing and six 
minute walk testing, all of which are greater than minimal risk procedures.  
3.0 * Describe the safety precautions that will be taken to minimize risks/harms:  
Oxygen saturations will be continuously monitored during the six minute walk testing and inpatient bedside 
pulmonary rehabilitation sessions. Any participant demonstrating oxygen desaturations during these 
activities will undergo a formal exercise desaturation study to determine oxygen requirements prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5482]. In addition, vital signs will be monitored before, during, and after each beside pulmonary 
rehabilitation session. These sessions will allow investigators to assess participant safety with exercise and 
to disqualify any participants that are unable  to participate safely in endurance and/or resistance training. 
Finally, participants will be provided an automated blood pressure cuff and pulse oximeter to allow for 
intermittent monitoring of blood pressure and continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation  and heart rate 
during the home pulmonary telerehabilitation sessions. Prior studies have shown home -based pulmonary 
telerehabilitation programs to be safe, even in severe COPD. However, if the exercise physiologist has any 
concern with participant safety during the home -based telerehabilitation sessions, emergency services will 
be immediately contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

Describe any potential for benefits to participants in this study:  
1.0 * Direct and Indirect Benefits to Subjects:  
Pulmonary rehabilitation is known to improve outcomes in COPD, both in stable disease and following acute 
exacerbations. Many patients are unable to attend pulmonary rehabilitation at a rehabilitation facility due to 
geographical inaccessibility, transportation issues, etc. This study will provide an alternative to traditional 
facility -based pulmonary rehabilitation to a group of  patients at highest risk for poor outcomes and may 
have a positive impact on exercise tolerance, physical activity levels, and quality of life in this patient group. 
This study should lead to a larger, randomized controlled trial to study this interventio n in a larger group of 
patients.  
2.0 * Describe alternatives (research or non -research) that are available to subjects if they choose 
not to participate in this study:

Participating in the pulmonary telerehabilitation program  
Common Risks:  
Muscle soreness and/or breathlessness may be experienced when participating in exercise.  
  
Infreq uent Risks:  
Maximal exercise testing is associated with a [ADDRESS_260667] outcome (e.g. heart 
attack, abnormal heart rhythm), including the possibility of death in patients with known cardiovascular disease. 
All exercise performe d as part of this study will be at a much lower work capacity and participants will be screened 
prior to participation to lower the overall risk of a medical event.

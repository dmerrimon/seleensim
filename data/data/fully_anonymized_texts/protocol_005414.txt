diuretics (furosemide versus torsemide) on clinical outcomes among patients currently on a 
stable dose of loop diuretics. All patients will be followed for one year.
Our primary hypothesis is that torsemide will improve clinical outcomes when compared to 
furosemide. 
Secondary Objective (if applicable)
Secondary objectives of this protocol will be to examine the effect of torsemide versus 
furosemide for the following endpoints:
All-cause mortality or all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350623] 4 years. Completion of enrollment, statistical analysis, and

4Study Design
This study will be a randomized, unblinded, two-arm, multi-center clinical trial of patients receiving 
loop diuretics for treatment of heart failure in an outpatient clinic. This study will serve as 
additional enrollment for Cardio-Renal Effects of Torsemide vs. Furosemide: A TRANSFORMHF 
Mechanistic Sub-Study (HIC [PHONE_7257]) which is currently only enrolling patients admitted to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350624]. Thus allowing for expanded enrollment into HIC 
[PHONE_7257] with a more diverse group of heart failure patients. Participants will be co-enrolled 
into this study and HIC [PHONE_7257]. 
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either oral torsemide OR oral furosemide (dosing at discretion 
of local provider with dose equivalency guidance provided). This study will include stable 
subjects seen at the outpatient setting. The initial and follow-up dosing of torsemide and 
furosemide will be at healthcare provider discretion, with the following conversion provided as a 
guide: 1 mg torsemide to 2-4 mg oral furosemide. For instance, a patient would receive 
torsemide 20mg or furosemide 40-80 mg. Providers will be asked to document their planned 
initial dose and dosing frequency of torsemide and furosemide
Randomization will occur within thirty days  after the consent process and at the discretion of the 
healthcare provider and research team. Following randomization, the study medication is 
expected to constitute the oral diuretic therapy for one year. Patients will be prescribed the 
randomized study medication on the day of randomization.
Dose adjustments will be at the discretion of the treating healthcare provider(s) with strategies in 
place to maintain prescription of and adherence to the randomized medication. All patients will 
have 30-day, and 12-month post-randomization phone contacts for assessment of vital status, 
interval hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], concomitant HF medications, adherence, and weight.
To achieve these goals, we propose a multi-center 125-patient study that will also co-enroll into 
Transform Ancillary (HIC [PHONE_7257]) a mechanistic sub-study of this study and 
TRANSFORMHF.

1 Introduction
1.1 Introductory Statement
This document is a protocol for a human research study. The purpose of this protocol is to 
ensure that this study is to be conducted according to (International Conference on 
Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice) ICH GCP guidelines, and according to CFR 21 Part 
312, other applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.
2 Background
2.1.1 Preclinical Experience
Preclinical and clinical data support the benefits of torsemide over furosemide. Compared 
with furosemide, torsemide has increased bioavailability and a longer half-life with

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 1/7/2021HIC [PHONE_7255] 11/23/2021/Version #[ADDRESS_435812] a substantial decrease in heart failure morbidity and 
potentially mortality with torsemide compared to furosemide 7,8-10.
2.1.2 Clinical Experience
Background/prevalence of research topic 
Nearly 7 million Americans are affected with heart failure (HF), and its prevalence is 
expected to increase to nearly 10 million by 2030.11 At age 40, an American’s lifetime risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_85025] 1 in 5.11 HF causes tremendous morbidity and mortality, with over 1 million 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37081] U.S. each year and with HF listed on 1 in 9 death certificates 
respectively.11 While HF is generally regarded as the inability of the heart to pump sufficient 
blood, on a population level,  congestion is the primary driver of symptoms leading to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].12-15
Strategies to treat and prevent fluid/sodium retention have not changed significantly since 
the 1960’s with the introduction of loop diuretics. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_350626], they are paradoxically one of the least well-studied classes of 
HF medications.
Torsemide has theoretical pharmacokinetic (PK) advantages to furosemide: Furosemide is 
currently the mostly commonly prescribed loop diuretic but it has erratic absorption, with 
bioavailability reported to range from 10%.  to 100%.16,17 Additionally, even if total 
absorption is constant, the peak serum concentration can vary widely based on the prandial 
and clinical status of the patient18,19 Since, loop diuretics require a minimal threshold 
concentration to induce natriuresis, even with identical bioavailability, slow absorption can 
limit the time above the renal threshold and result in minimal natriuresis. Importantly, the 
variability in absorption occurs both on an inter- and intra-patient level. For instance, factors 
such as a large meal (i.e., sodium load) or bowel edema (i.e., progressive volume retention) 
can adversely alter furosemide PK parameters, when it is most important the diuretic is 
effective. Unlike furosemide, torsemide has consistent bioavailability of >80% and absorption 
kinetics are reproducible and typi[INVESTIGATOR_350627]. 18,19Torsemide also has a significantly longer half-life in HF (~6 hours) compared to 
furosemide (~2.7 hours).[ADDRESS_435813] diuretic sodium retention. When a short half-life diuretic 
(i.e., furosemide) wears off, the kidney is left unchecked to reabsorb sodium, and the 
quantity of excreted sodium during diuresis equals the quantity of sodium reabsorbed after 
the diuretic is cleared, resulting in no net loss of sodium. Given that torsemide has 
predictable bioavailability, absorption kinetics, and a relatively long half-life, the hypothesis 
follows that it could offer more consistent and superior control of volume status, thus 
improving outcomes such as death and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) 
guidelines indicate that the optimal use of diuretics is the cornerstone of any successful 
approach to the treatment of heart failure.20 However, in light of the lack of an adequately 
powered study, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that torsemide should be 
recommended over furosemide in the management of heart failure.

medication (Torsemide) to relieve their fluid congestion and help prevent further sequela of 
heart failure.
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact
This study is designed to be a prospective, randomized, comparative-effectiveness study to 
definitively compare torsemide with furosemide in heart failure patients. It is meant to serve 
as additional enrollment in Cardio-Renal Effects of Torsemide vs. Furosemide: A 
TRANSFORM-HF Mechanistic Sub-Study (HIC [PHONE_7257]) to broaden the heart failure 
population to include those that are more stable in their treatment. Patients will be coenrolled 
into this study and HIC [PHONE_7257].
3.2.1 Potential Risks
This study will evaluate oral torsemide versus oral furosemide in patients with heart failure. 
Both torsemide and furosemide are currently used in routine clinical practice and are 
recommended by [CONTACT_350646]/AHA heart failure guidelines. We therefore do not 
anticipate that participation in this study will be associated with increased risks beyond that 
of standard heart failure therapy. 
Furosemide: Risks include hepatic encephalopathy, oral and gastric irritation, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
pancreatitis, diarrhea/constipation, jaundice, increased liver enzymes, nausea, vomiting, 
anorexia, systemic vasculitis, tinnitus and hearing loss, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, 
anemia, photosensitivity, drug rash, orthostatic hypotension, increase in cholesterol and 
triglyceride serum levels, hyperglycemia, restlessness, glycosuria, urinary bladder spasm, 
hyperuricemia, thrombophlebitis, severe anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, pruritis, 
paresthesias, headache, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision, muscle spasm, fever, weakness. 
Torsemide: Risks include headache, excessive urination, dizziness, rhinitis, asthenia, 
diarrhea, ECG abnormality, cough Increase, constipation, nausea, leucopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, anemia, increase in liver transaminases, thiamine (B1) deficiency, 
hypotension, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, Hypocalcemia Hyperchloremic alkalosis, 
Hyperglycemia, Hyperuricemia Hyponatremia, Arthralgia, Dyspepsia Sore Throat, Myalgia 
Chest Pain, Insomnia Edema, Nervousness, Pancreatitis, Abdominal pain, Paresthesia, 
Confusion, Visual impairment, Loss of appetite, Stephens- Johnsons Syndrome), 
Photosensitivity (sensitivity to light), Pruritis(itchy), Acute urinary retention (urine in your 
bladder that you have not been able to pass), Tinnitus (ringing in your ears), Hearing loss, 
Severe renal impairment (loss of kidneys full ability to filter wastes and excess fluids from 
your blood, which are then excreted in your urine).
Data collection: We anticipate minimal risk related to collection of data from the clinical 
record, including paper charts, EMR, physical exams, and blood and urine samples. We also 
anticipate minimal risk associated with data entry into the electronic database, which is 
password-protected and stored on a secure server.

urine collection. 
Minimizing Risks
Furosemide and Torsemide: Both diuretics are currently used in routine clinical practice 
and are recommended by [CONTACT_350646]/AHA heart failure guidelines. We therefore do not 
anticipate that participation in this study will be associated with increased risks beyond that 
of standard heart failure therapy. 
Data collection: Identifying data will be available only to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_32528], 
and will be used only to facilitate medical record review, and prevent duplicate screenings of 
patients while looking for subjects to enroll in the study. All data sheets, electronic data 
entries, and laboratory samples will be labeled with a unique identifier code. These numbers 
will be unique to the patient and will be the common link between specimens and the data. 
No identifying data will be reported to the public or in any publications that may result from 
this research.
Urine collection for pregnancy testing: There is virtually no risk to the patient related to 
urine collection.

6.1.2 Dosage, Administration, Schedule 
The participant’s treating healthcare provider is responsible for dosage and the medication 
schedule. 
6.1.3 Method of Assignment/Randomization 
Among those meeting eligibility criteria, and after they are consented; the participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of two treatment groups. Anticipated initial daily dosing 
regimens for oral torsemide and oral furosemide will be recorded by [CONTACT_350648]. Patient treatment assignment will be generated using a simple 
randomization scheme (i.e. no stratification) given the open-label nature of the intervention to 
limit the potential bias due to predictable treatment assignment.
At the time of randomization, the following baseline characteristics should be documented: 
age, sex, race, ethnicity, ejection fraction (most recent by [CONTACT_333801]), concomitant HF 
medications and other key baseline variables. Following randomization, study team will 
identify the treatment assignment and confirm with the patient and the treatment team the 
outpatient loop diuretic prescription and accessibility.

Participants of this trial will be called at the end of thirty (+2/-2) days and at one year (+2/-2 
days).  During the two phone calls they will be asked how are they feeling, if they are still 
taking their randomized medication, if not why was it changed, and what their current weight 
is. If the participant is not able to be reached after three attempts, this information will be 
recorded from their EMR.

Definitions
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• death, 
• a life-threatening adverse event, 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, 
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Severity
Adverse events will be graded according to [name [CONTACT_30319], e.g. CTCAE v5.0]. For AEs 
not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity. 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities. 
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially

20lifethreatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily 
equate to “serious”.]
Relationship to Investigational Product
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. 
In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an 
abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study 
intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention 
(dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if 
necessary.
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). 
Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., 
the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate 
only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as 
appropriate.
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments).
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There 
must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].
Expectedness
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_30270]. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
intervention.

226.3.2 Informed Consent
Proper written, informed consent and HIPAA authorization will be obtained prior to patient 
participation in this trial. The overall protocol (including objectives, procedures and duration), 
potential risks and benefits, voluntary nature and ability to withdraw will be discussed with 
each patient. The patient will be given a copy of the IRB-approved ICF to review and will 
have all questions answered before being asked to sign the informed consent form (ICF). 
Verification of comprehension of the consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_350650]. The patient will be instructed that 
his or her care will not be affected by [CONTACT_85102], or not. If the patient 
voluntarily agrees to participate in the trial, he or she will be asked to sign the ICF. The 
original ICF will be kept with the study documents and a copy will be made for the patient’s

confirm with the patient’s provider that the patient has the requisite ability and capacity to 
give informed consent prior to approaching the patient regarding the study. If at any time 
during the study there is concern regarding a patient’s mental status, study staff will both 
notify the patient’s RN and provider, and reevaluate whether the patient is still appropriate for 
participation in the study. After the study objectives and procedures are explained to the

Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_350651] a clinical diagnosis of HF receiving 
outpatient loop diuretics. Patients whose providers feel they are appropriate for the study will 
be approached. Pursuant to HIPAA regulations, a log of disclosures of protected health 
information for recruitment/screening purposes will be kept.
Any participant that has a positive point of care urine pregnancy test will be withdrawn from 
the study. Any participant that becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the 
study. Any participant that has their randomized study medication changed over the course 
of the year will be asked to continue with their study participation. 
Participants will have the option to select whether they are interested in hearing about future 
heart failure studies. Locating stable heart failure patients who are on a stable dose of loop 
diuretics can be difficult, and the inclusion/ exclusion criteria aligns with the majority of our 
ongoing and future research projects.

6.3.5 On Study Visits
Randomization
• Prior to randomization any female participant that is [ADDRESS_435829]. 
• After confirmation from the treating healthcare provider that the participant is safe to 
randomize, the potential doses for furosemide and torsemide will be collected.
• The participant will be randomized in a secure database (Yale REDCap).  After 
randomization, the treating healthcare provider and the participant will be notified of 
the treatment assignment. 
• The treating healthcare provider will be asked to place an order for the assigned 
treatment therapy.
• The study team will ensure that the randomized study medication has been 
prescribed and that the participant has been able to attain the medication from their 
pharmacy.
6.3.6 End of Study and Follow-up
The participant will be called at 30 days (+2/ -2 days) to assess for any adverse events, to 
see how they are feeling, their current weight, if they are still taking the randomized study 
medication, and any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284729].  If the participant is unable to

• Any clinical adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or 
situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the 
best interest of the participant. 
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention occurs. 
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not 
previously recognized) that precludes further study participation
Continuation of Drug Therapy After Study Closure: Both possible randomized treatments are 
standard of care therapy. While the participant will no longer be required to take the study 
medication as part of the study, it will be at the discretion of their treating healthcare provider 
whether to continue the patient on the randomized treatment.   
6.4 Statistical Method 
Statistical Design
This will be a randomized, parallel-arm, controlled trial. Randomization will occur at the 
patient level with no blocks of stratification. Treatment factor will include two levels: 
furosemide vs torsemide. 
This study will serve as additional enrollment for the “Cardio-Renal Effects of Torsemide vs. 
Furosemide: A TRANSFORM-HF Mechanistic Sub-Study” (HIC [PHONE_7257]), which is 
currently only enrolling patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350624]. Thus, the 
present study will allow for expanded enrollment into HIC [PHONE_7257] with a more diverse 
group of heart failure patients. Therefore, sections 6.4.1. to 6.5.10 were based on the 
“CardioRenal Effects of Torsemide vs. Furosemide: A TRANSFORM-HF Mechanistic 
SubStudy” (HIC [PHONE_7257]). 
6.4.1 Sample Size Considerations
The present study is thought to potentially be part of the “ToRsemide compArisoN with 
furoSemide FOR Management of Heart Failure” (TRANSFORM-HF, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). For that 
study, sample size was estimated as 721 events (approximately 6000 patients) assuming a 
hazard ratio of 0.80 and a power of 85%. Given that it is unlikely that the present study will 
enroll so many patients, and patients enrolled in the present study will also be coenrolled in 
the “Cardio-Renal Effects of Torsemide vs. Furosemide: A TRANSFORM-HF Mechanistic 
Sub-Study (HIC [PHONE_7257])”, we calculated sample size based on the later study (see 
below).    
In the “Cardio-Renal Effects of Torsemide vs. Furosemide: A TRANSFORM-HF Mechanistic 
Sub-Study (HIC [PHONE_7257])” , the endpoint change in plasma volume has the largest 
number of causal inputs and thus will be expected to drive the sample size requirement. The 
change in plasma volume in real world hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350634] -0.5L, with a standard deviation 
of 0.8L.[ADDRESS_435830] treatment blood volumes was high at r=0.87 (personal 
communication with [CONTACT_10017]). A clinically relevant difference in the current proposed study 
would be a ≥300cc change in plasma volume. Of note, this small magnitude of change is 
similar  to that observed in patients that hemoconcentrate, a finding associated with

determined by I-131 albumin is small (~2%) and the within subject correlation of serial 
plasma volume measures before and after treatment is high (i.e., r>0.9 is expected in this 
study).[ADDRESS_435832] 
deviation in blood volume from randomization to 30 days will be significantly less than the 
0.8L seen in the acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350635] a much greater degree of treatment 
heterogeneity exists. As such, with a sample size of 125 patients (62 per group) we will have 
>80% power to detect a difference in mean changes between groups of >26.5% between 
groups. (Calculated using PASS version 15.0.[ADDRESS_435833]

Furosemide vs Torsemide, and time will be included also as a main factor with two levels: 
baseline vs end of the intervention. Primary outcome variables (such as plasma volume) will 
be measured at baseline and at day 30. Repeated measures or “change” parameters will be

The source documents that will be collected during this study include: A patient contact [CONTACT_982], 
phone call follow-up at thirty-day CRF and phone call follow-up at one year CRF. All source 
documents will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked facility that is only accessed 
by [CONTACT_5984]. Information from source documents will be collected and stored on secure 
data base REDCap. This information will be assigned a study code before it is shared with 
study collaborators. 
7.9 Data or Specimen Storage/Security
Name, address, telephone number, medical record number (MRN), medical history and 
allergies, current and past medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], information from a physical 
examination (ex: BP, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7146]), family medical history, 
results of blood, urine and imaging tests (ex: x-rays, CT scans, MRIs, or ultrasound) and

30pathology tests (biopsies), DNA, RNA, tissue and blood. The patients’ entire medical record 
will be reviewed.
Digital data will be stored in a secured server.
Data collected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_350639], received an exemption or determination by [CONTACT_350658]. Data will be distributed for research 
projects of the same nature and similar purpose specified in this protocol, as agreed to by 
[CONTACT_350659]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_350640].
Data collected during the research study will be shared with other investigators for research 
projects of the same nature and similar purpose specified in this protocol, as described 
above. Researchers may still use the data that was collected before the subject withdrew 
permission/authorization in order to complete the research that has already commenced. All 
data retained and not yet used for research purposes will be destroyed upon receiving notice 
of a subject’s withdrawal of permission for continued use of their data. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_350641]’ anonymity is maintained. Each participant is assigned a 
unique study identification number and is tracked through this number. Participants’ clinical 
data will be entered into password-protected software and stored on a secure server. A log 
of participants’ names, participant ID numbers and pertinent registration information (ex: 
address, phone number and emergency contact [CONTACT_3031]) is maintained on a password 
protected computer, to allow re-identification of participants when necessary. This will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_350642].
7.10 Retention of Records
After study enrollment is complete continued analysis of data will be undertaken, and thus 
destruction of identified data is not planned until completion of all analyses. 
7.11 Study Monitoring
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22419], assuring protocol 
compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency quarterly. During 
the review process the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_205562], require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74118] (IRB) have the authority to stop or suspend 
the study or require modifications.
7.12 Data Safety Monitoring Plan
Greater than Minimal Risk Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Personnel 
responsible for the safety review and its frequency: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_350643], assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the 
specified frequency which must be conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including

31when re-approval of the protocol is sought). During the review process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_170868], require modification &/or amendment, or 
close to enrollment. Either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_127833], have the authority to stop or suspend the study 
or require modifications.
The overall risk associated with the proposed study is deemed greater than minimal 
for the following reasons: We believe this study presents greater than minimal risk with the 
randomization of furosemide or torsemide because although both medications are standard 
of care treatments for heart failure, the potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated 
adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to predict with certainty 
the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of firsthand experience with the 
proposed study methods. The study poses minimal risk from the data collection, as all data 
will be collected and stored in password protected data bases and all research personnel 
have been trained in appropriate data collection and storage.  
7.13 Study Modification
Consistent review of the protocol and study procedures will be conducted on a frequent 
basis, depending on the need of the study team or if new information has been obtained. 
Based on this the protocol will be modified on an as needed basis. 
7.14 Study Discontinuation
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will 
promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will 
provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], 
as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.
 Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]   
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met Determination of futility

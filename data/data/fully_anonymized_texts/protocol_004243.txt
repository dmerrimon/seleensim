SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS
A randomized controlled trial of computed tomography (CT) coronary angiography (Group B) as 
compared to the traditional approach (usual care) (Group A) for low- to intermediate-risk chest pain 
patients.   
 
1. To estimate the rate of major cardiac events (AMI or cardiac death) within [ADDRESS_511997] coronary angiography (Group B) who were found not to have significant coronary 
artery disease.  Significant coronary artery di sease is defined as greater than or equal to 50% 
stenosis of the left main, left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex, right coronary artery 
(RCA), or their first order branches.  
 
ELIGIBILITY  (see Section 6.0 for details) 
Patients presenting to the emergency department, who are at low- to intermediate-risk for an acute 
coronary syndrome by [CONTACT_406126], will be 
candidates for participation in this study. 
 
SAMPLE SIZE 
Total of 1365 participants will be recruited for this trial; 455 will be randomized to the traditional usual-
care rule out treatment and 910 will be randomized to a rule out strategy including CT coronary 
angiography.  Accrual will be accomplished in [ADDRESS_511998] 
This protocol for human research study is conducted according to [LOCATION_002] and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] Guidelines), 
applicable government regulations (e.g. Title 45, Part 46 Code of Federal Regulations) and the 
American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) research policies and procedures. 
Of the nearly 6 million patients presenting annually in U.S. emergency departments (EDs) for evaluation 
of chest pain,1 55% to 70% do not have a cardiac cause for their symptoms.2,3 However, given the 
prevalence and clinical significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), excluding a cardiac cause of 
chest pain remains a challenging clinical problem and often mandates extensive testing. There is little 
ambiguity in the management of high-risk patients: Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction (STEMI) are treated expeditiously with primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) or 
fibrinolysis. Patients with unstable angina and non-STEMI are treated with antithrombin and antiplatelet 
agents with rapid transition to the catheterization laboratory. The management and disposition of 
patients with STEMI and non-STEMI are dictated by [CONTACT_406127].4,[ADDRESS_511999] of these patients are not ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes (ACS); yet 
the great majority is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] rule out MI [myocardial infarction] protocols driving 
up health care costs. Moreover, these unnecessary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406087], 
ED crowding, and prolonged ED stays, all of which lead to poor resource utilization.[ADDRESS_512000] 
adequate specificity. Thus, low- to intermediate-risk patients often are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406088] a 12- to 24-hour period. We believe that two recent 
complementary technological advances might help alleviate this predicament: They are computed 
tomography (CT) coronary angiogram and high sensitivity troponin assays.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_512001] pain or other 
symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia,1 the majority of whom are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406089]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_406090], 2% to 4% of patients with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are inadvertently discharged home from the ED.2-3,[ADDRESS_512002] patients with potential ACS. 
 
The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Risk Score was derived from a study of a population 
of patients with known unstable angina/non-STEMI.19 Through a multivariate analysis of their 
ESSENCE and TIMI 11B databases, Antman et al. identified seven factors to create the TIMI Risk 
Score; these factors were independently predictive of the adverse outcomes of death, AMI, or recurrent 
ischemia at 14 days and documented increased risk with the addition of each positive risk factor. Further 
validation studies using the PRISM-PLUS20 and TACTICS-TIMI 1821 trials documented increased 
benefit from early, aggressive interventions for patients with higher TIMI Risk Scores. A modified 
version of the risk score applied to the TIMI III Registry22 of admitted unstable angina/non-STEMI 
patients successfully predicted death, MI, and/or recurrent ischemia at both 6 weeks and 1 year.23
 
The TIMI Risk Score has now been validated in the ED patients with potential ACS. In a retrospective 
study conducted by [CONTACT_27156], we enrolled 3,[ADDRESS_512003] to 30-day adverse outcome; adverse outcomes ranged from 2.1% of patients 
with a score of 0, to 100% with a score of 7. In a prospective study, conducted by [CONTACT_406128],25 total of 1,490 eligible participants were enrolled and found 
that the incidence of 30-day death, AMI, and/or revascularization was highly related to the presenting 
TIMI Risk Score: TIMI 0, 1.7%; TIMI 1, 7.9 %; TIMI 2, 8.4%; TIMI 3, 16.5%; TIMI 4, 24.6%; TIMI 5, 
37.5%; TIMI 6, 33.3% ( p<0.001). Approximately two-thirds of patients enrolled in the study had a TIMI 
score of [ADDRESS_512004] with rapid patient disposition and treatment. The 
optimal use of cardiac markers depends upon the physicia ns intended use. Since up to 85% of patients 
who present to the ED with potential ACS do not ultimately have a cardiac etiology for their symptoms, 
a marker with a high negative predictive value is useful to allow expeditious evaluation and discharge 
from the ED. Markers with high positive predictive values are ideal to tailor aggressive care for patients 
at high risk of cardiovascular complications. To that end, a panel of cardiac markers may ideally provide 
for both a rapid rule out and for a rapid identif ication of patients at high-risk for ACS. 
2.2.[ADDRESS_512005] generation cardiac troponin assays became elevated at the same rate as CK-
MBpeaking at [ADDRESS_512006] pain,36 ACS, and/or AMI, cardiac-marker testing in the ED, 
they did not identify most ED patients that subsequently developed adverse events.37,[ADDRESS_512007] demonstrated 99th percentile values ranging from 0.012 
to 0.06 µg/L equivalent to 12 to 60 pg/mL; with lower limits of detection to 6 pg/mL 39-[ADDRESS_512008] couple of hours 
following presentation. In one study, a high sensitivity commercial cTnI assay allowed the 
diagnosis of acute MI to be made using rising values, in over 80% of patients within [ADDRESS_512009] (EBCT) for coronary calcium scoring is useful for detection of high-grade stenosis 
and occlusion with a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 94%.[ADDRESS_512010] had a cardiac event.45 Laudon et al found a 100% negative predictive value 
in [ADDRESS_512011] pain.47 They found the cardiovascular event rate to be 
0.6% for 76 patients with a calcium score of 0 compared to 14% for patients with calcium scores greater 
than 400. Raggi et al studied [ADDRESS_512012] for coronary 
calcium scoring has a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 89% for the presence of obstructive CAD.[ADDRESS_512013] pain. Further, in Raggi et als Bayesian  analysis, EBCT provided 
a cost savings of 45% to 65% over a pathway including treadmill testing.[ADDRESS_512014] demonstrated the safety of using the absence of coronary 
calcifications as criteria for risk stratification;44-[ADDRESS_512015] by [CONTACT_406129] (or plaque). Leber et al reported a specificity of 97%, indicating the utility 
of the method in identifying absence of CAD.[ADDRESS_512016] coronary 
angiography in 70 patients; they analyzed 1,065 coronary artery segments and found a mean difference 
in percent stenosis of 1.3 ± 14.2%.[ADDRESS_512017] coronary angiography for significant stenoses were: 86%, 95%, 66%, and 98%, respectively. This 
indicates the reliability of a negative CT coronary angiogram in excluding CAD.  
 
Prior cardiac catheterization results are known to be exceedingly useful for risk stratification. Patients 
who have previously been documented to have minimal (<25%) stenosis or normal coronary 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512018] an excellent long-term prognosis with greater than 98% free from myocardial 
infarction 10 years later.51 Repeat cardiac catheterizations an average of 9 years later found that 
approximately 90% of patients did not develop even single vessel CAD.[ADDRESS_512019] eliminates the possibility of an ACS. 
These patients are routinely discharged from the ED without admission for further evaluation of 
potential ACS. 
Based on this body of evidence, a combination approach has led the ED at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406091] (HUP) to commence utilization of th e test in real time clinical practice, consistent 
with the standard of care, including: 
The outstanding negative predictive value of coronary calcium scoring, as documented in 3 
studies of ED patients with potential ACS;45,46,[ADDRESS_512020] coronary angiography and routine cardiac catheterization 
results; The ability to obtain both calcium scores and visualization of the coronary arteries with CT 
coronary angiography.  
 
Continuous quality improvement initiatives have found that the test performance, in our patient 
population, performs as well as that reported in the literature.  
 
Studies have demonstrated that CT coronary angiography can accurately identify or exclude coronary 
stenosis in low-,53-[ADDRESS_512021] coronary angiography had a 100% 
negative predictive value for ACS during index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406092] 5 months. Similarly, Rubinshtein et al63 found a 100% negative predictive value for the ED 
diagnosis of ACS in [ADDRESS_512022] coronary angiography was 
comparable to myocardial perfusion imaging (86% vs 71%), as was the specificity (92% vs 90%).  
 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512023] effective and was 
associated with a shorter length of stay than: observation unit management with CT coronary 
angiography, observation unit management with stress test, and admission with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8384]-directed care. 
Although the strategy of immediate CT coronary angiography appeared to be as safe as the other 
strategies, the cohorts were small, preventing definitive conclusions. Khare et al performed decision 
analysis comparing CT coronary angiography to other strategies and found it to be cost effective in this 
model. [ADDRESS_512024] a 1% or lower 30-day risk of cardiovascular death or 
MI, thus demonstrating the utility of CT coronary angiography in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_406093].  
 
Unlike prior studies, our work allowed us to extend this approach to patients without mandating an 
overnight stay in the observation unit.[ADDRESS_512025] an initial serum creatinine measurement, we were able to discharge the great 
majority (75%) safely without any cardiovascular deaths or MIs.[ADDRESS_512026] 
coronary angiography produces outcomes similar to those reported with inpatient admission and 
observation unit stays, while avoiding the majority of admissions and shortening the duration of time 
required to determine the patient is safe for discharge. 
 
None of the 508 patients with a maximal stenosis less than 50% on CT coronary angiography were 
found to have reversible ischemia on stress test or significant CAD on cardiac catheterization.66 
Although not all patients received further testing, none had a cardiovascular death or MI within 30 days. 
Conversely, there were no patients with high-grade (>80%) lesions on CT coronary angiography with 
negative stress tests or catheterizations. As might be expected, patients with coronary stenosis between 
50% and 70% on CT coronary angiography had positive or negative stress test resultsconfirming that 
anatomy alone cannot always predict physiology, particularly in patients with intermediate degrees of 
stenosis.  
 
Therefore, based upon the work by [CONTACT_406130], we plan to incorporate CT coronary angiography into this rapi d rule out protocol. CT 
coronary angiography has been available and used in the HUP ED since 2005. It has been available at 
the Penn Presby[CONTACT_406131] 2007. Recent American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines have made 
it a Class IIa recommendation for evaluation of low risk patients with potential ACS. It is now a 
standard-of-care procedure.67

3.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS 
In this study, eligible participants with potential ACS will be  randomi zed to traditional rule out care 
(Group  A) or a rapid rule out strategy co mprising CT coronary angiography (Group B). 
3.1 Primary Aim   
3.1.1 To estimate the rate of major cardiac events (AMI or cardiac death) within [ADDRESS_512027] coronary angiography. Significant coronary artery disease is defined as greater 
than or equal to 50% stenosis of the left main, left anterior descending (LAD), left 
circumflex, right coronary artery (RCA), or their first order branches. 
3.[ADDRESS_512028] randomization. Health care utilization components will include cardiac-related 
lab tests, diagnostic (imaging) tests, interventions, repeat ED visits that for cardiac related 
problems, and repeat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406094]. 
3.2.5  To compare the two study groups in terms of the respective rates of major cardiac events 
(cardiac death, AMI, and revascularization )within [ADDRESS_512029] significant coronary disease at 
the index visit. 
4.0 STUDY OVERVIEWThis is a randomized, controlled trial of the trad itional rule out appro ach based on institutional 
standard of care (Group A) as comp ared to a CT coronary angiographybased rule out strategy (Group 
B) for low- to intermediate-risk chest pain participants. In the traditional-care arm (Group A), all 
management and disposition decisions will be made by [CONTACT_406132]. Participants will receive disposition (admit to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admit to cardiac diagnostic unit, or 
discharge to home), diagnostic testing (none, stress testing, or cardiac catheterization), and treatment 
according to the team caring for the participant.  
 
In the study CT coronary angiographybased rapid rule out arm (Gr oup B), participants will receive 
initial cardiac troponin and creatinine tests. Upon return of normal laboratory values (including a

calculated creatinine clearance), the participants will receive a CT coronary angiography an estimated [ADDRESS_512030] results will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404738], which will be dictated by 
[CONTACT_406133].  
For both Group A and B participants enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406095]), participants will have serum 
banked for future research.  In order to conduct future research for analysis of cardiac markers, blood 
samples will be collected at three (3) approximated time points: 0 minutes (time of blood draw), 90 to 
180 minutes, and 6 hours, or up until the time of discharge. The blood samples will be collected and 
stored at University of Pennsylvania Health Care System (See Appendix V for details). There will be no 
results from these blood tests available to the healthcare providers.  
 
 
5.0 PARTICIPANT SELECTION/ELIGIBILITY CRITERIAPatients who present in the Emergency Department (ED) with a chief complaint consistent with 
potential ACS may be eligible for participation in this trial. If the potential participant meets the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, he/she will be randomized to one of the two arms of the study, the 
traditional standard-of-care arm or the study arm. Randomization will occur after the initial ECG.   If the 
patient has low creatinine clearance, they will be subsequently removed from the study. If an elevated 
troponin level is discovered after randomization but prior to CT coronary angiography or stress testing, 
the patient will be treated according to institutional standard of care and will remain in the study for the 
intent-to-treat analysis. If after randomization, but prior to CT coronary angiography or stress testing, 
the participant is discovered to have had CT coronary angiography or normal catheterization results 
within the year prior to presentation, then the participant will be treated according to institutional 
standard of care and will be included in the analysis for intent to treat.

6.3 IRB Approval and Informed Consent Form
 The study will be approved by [CONTACT_406134] (IRBs) and the 
appropriate institutional review committees. All study participants will provide written informed 
consent (ICF). 
 
All institutions must have site-specific IRB approval for the protocol and ICF for this study. (The 
ICF is included in this protocol as Appendix I.) The investigator and the investigator-designated 
research staff must follow OHRP-approved consent procedures (Title 45, Part 46 Code of 
Federal Regulations), as well as those set by [CONTACT_212557]. A copy of the IRB 
approval letter and a copy of the IRB-approved, site-specific ICF must be submitted to the 
ACRIN study monitor for review and to keep on file at ACRIN Headquarters (fax: 215-717-
0936, ATTN: ACRIN PA 4005 Study Monitor) prior to registering the first participant. 
6.4  Accrual Goals and Monitoring
The ACRIN Biostatistics and Data Management Center (BDMC) will monitor participant 
accrual. Total target accrual for this study is [ADDRESS_512039] year, the accrual 
goal will be 700 participants. If the target is not reached, a review will be conducted with the 
intention of discovering and resolving any recruitment barriers. 
Monitoring of study-specific adverse events (AEs) and cardiac-related deaths and AMIs will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_406135]. The medical monitor will review 
AEs on an on-going basis. An adjudication committee will provide oversight to the reported 
cardiac-related deaths and AMI. In addition, accrual and safety information will be presented to 
the ACRIN PA (Pennsylvania) Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) at regularly 
scheduled meetings thereof; the PA DSMB may, at its discretion, re-evaluate the study with 
respect to feasibility or the need for additional participating institutions. 
7.0 DATA MANAGEMENT/ONLINE REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION 
7.1 General
7.1.1 The ACRIN web address is www.acrin.org . 
7.1.2 Data collection and management will be performed by [CONTACT_406136] (BDMC) of ACRIN under the direction of [CONTACT_406175]. The Biostatistics Center (BC) is located at Center for Statistical Sciences at 
Brown University in Providence, RI, and the Data Management Center (DMC) is 
located at ACRIN in Philadelphia, PA. 
7.1.3  Participant enrollment and data collection occurs through a series of programmed 
screens accessed through the ACRIN web site to register/randomize participants, 
collect participant data, and maintain calendars of data submissions for each 
participant. By [CONTACT_212559], ACRIN has made participant registration, 
data entry, and updated calendar information available to clinical sites 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week. Each successful case registration is confirmed through receipt of an 
e-mail containing a registration/randomization confirmation and a case specific 
calendar identifying timelines for data and image submission. If the confirmation e-
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512040] been received, reply deadlines for queries about unclear data, 
deadlines for follow-up reports of adverse events, or changes in the protocol that 
change the data being collected or the timeframe. Updated calendars for each 
participant can be obtained 24 hours a day from the ACRIN web site. The research 
associate may use the calendar as a case management tool for data submission and 
follow-up scheduling.  
7.2.2  The investigative site is required to submit data according to protocol as detailed on 
each participants calendar, as long as the case status is designated as open/alive or 
until the study is terminated. For additional details on Clinical Data Collection Criteria, 
see Appendix IV. The case is closed when all data have been received, reviewed, and 
no outstanding data query exists for the case. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_512041]. Case report forms will be available on the web site through a series of 
links. Each web form is separated into modules; each module must be completed 
sequentially in order for the internal programming to be accurate. The user selects the 
link to the appropriate form and enters data directly into the web-based form. As 
information is entered into the web form application, various logic checks will be 
performed. These logic checks look for data that are missing, data that are out of range, 
and data that are in the wrong format (e.g. character data in a field requiring numeric 
responses). Such errors will be detected as soon as the user attempts to either submit the 
form or move to the next data element. They must be corrected before the form is 
transmitted to the DMC. The user will not be able to finalize form transmission to the 
DMC until all data entered pass these logic checks. Forms that are not completed in one 
sitting can still be submitted and completed at a later date. The form will remain 
available on the web until the Complete Form Submission button is depressed.  
7.2.4  Once data entry of a form is complete, and the summary form is reviewed for 
completeness and accuracy, the investigator or the research staff presses the Complete 
Form Submission button on the form summary screen and the data is transferred into 
the clinical database. No further direct revision of the submitted data is allowed after 
this point. E-mail confirmation of web data entry is automatically generated and sent to 
the site investigator or research associate listing all of the data generated and just 
submitted. Should a problem occur during transmission and the e-mail confirmation of 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512042] seek 
another Internet Service Provider (ISP). On a short-term basis, ACRIN can serve as an 
ISP. 
7.3 Registration/Randomization ProtocolOnce the investigator-designated research staff (i.e. the Research Associate [RA]) has completed the 
eligibility checklist (Appendix II) and the participant has been found to be eligible to participate in the 
trial, the potential participant will be consented.  Upon obtaining a signed informed consent form, the 
RA will register the participant by [CONTACT_406137] ( www.acrin.org ), and selecting the 
link for Data Center Login. Randomization will not occur until after the initial ECG is available but 
may occur prior to the availability of creatinine and cardiac troponin results.   If, after 
randomization, the participant is found to have an initially low creatinine clearance, they will be 
removed from the study.  If an elevated troponin level is discovered after randomization but prior to CT 
coronary angiography or stress testing, the patient will be treated according to institutional standard of 
care and will remain in the study for the intent-to-treat analysis. 
 
The registration screen begins by [CONTACT_406138], 
identification of the person who completed the checklist, whether the potential participant was found to 
be eligible on the basis of the checklist, and the date the study-specific informed consent form was 
signed. 
 
After completing the registration, the system assigns a participant-specific case number and a 
randomization group. The system then moves to a screen, which confirms that the participant has been 
successfully enrolled/randomized. This screen can be printed so that the registering site will have a copy 
of the registration/randomization for the participants record. 
 
Participants will be randomized into study group assignments (to Group Atraditional careor Group 
BCT coronary angiography) in 1 to 2 ratio base d upon blocked assignment in groups of 30. To avoid 
duplicate randomizations, do not re-register or re-randomize a participant; contact [CONTACT_406139].   
 
7.3.1 Unsuccessful Registrations/Randomization: In the unlikely event that the ACR web registration site is not accessible, sites will be 
able to use sequential numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) to randomize 
participants.  Randomization envelopes must always be opened sequentially (next highest 
number). Prior to opening the envelope, the research associate should write the date and 
her/his signature [CONTACT_406171]. When the ACRIN web site is accessible the 
RA should register the participant using the envelope randomization option.  
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512043] for Information (Z1 query letter) to the site 
RA or investigator specifying the problem and requesting clarification. The DMC 
updates the participants data submission calenda r with the due date for the site RA or 
investigators response.
7.6 Missing and Delinquent Data Submission
In addition to providing the investigator a data collection calendar for each case, the DMC periodically 
prompts institutions for timely submission of data through the use of a Forms Due Report. Distributed at 
intervals via the electronic mail system directly to both the RA and the investigator at each site, this 
report lists data items (e.g. forms, reports, and images) that are delinquent and those that will be due 
before the next report date. In addition to prompting clinicians to submit overdue data, the Forms Due 
Report helps to reconcile the DMCs case file with that  of the RA and/or investigator. Future Due Forms 
Report may be sent on an as needed basis in addition to past due reports. The site investigator or RA 
may use the Forms Due and Future Due Reports as a case management tool. 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512044] the data file. No changes to the data 
will be made at the BC.  
7.7.2  A goal of the monitoring of data is to assess compliance with the protocol and to look 
for unforeseen trends that may be indicative of procedural differences among clinical 
sites. If patterns are discovered in the data that appear to arise from causes specific to 
an institution, the BDMC will apprise the ACRIN Headquarters and the site of the 
problem, and work with the site, along with ACRIN Protocol Development and 
Regulatory Compliance (PDRC) department, until the problem has been resolved. If the 
BDMC, along with the PDRC, cannot find a resolution to the problem, it will be 
brought to the ACRIN Quality Assurance (QA) Committee for further discussion and 
resolution.  
8.0 STUDY PROCEDURESUpon presentation to the emergency department with complaints symptomatic of potential ACS, the 
principal site investigator (or designee) at the participating emergency department must confirm that the 
potential participant meets the eligibility criteria (see Section 5.0). Medical eligibility will be determined 
as detailed in the inclusion and exclusion criteria section of the protocol. This will require thorough 
review of cardiac risk factors, symptom characteristics, blood test results, etc, as detailed below for 
baseline Visit 1. Upon registration and randomization of the participant to Group B (CT coronary 
angiography rule out arm) or Group A (traditional standard-of-care rule out arm), participant will 
proceed with either CT coronary angiography per protocol as outlined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_512045]-of-care rule out strategies. 
 
For both Group A and B participants enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406095]) will have serum banked for 
future research.  In order to conduct future research for analysis of cardiac markers, blood samples will 
be collected at three (3) approximated time points: 0 minutes (time of blood draw), 90 to 180 minutes, 
and 6 hours, or up until the time of discharge. The blood samples will be collected and stored at 
University of Pennsylvania Health Care System (see Appendix V for details). There will be no results 
from these blood tests available to the healthcare providers.

9.[ADDRESS_512053] (or as much of the chest as breathholding permits) for the purpose of 
calcium scoring, and to evaluate lung abnormalities. This will be followed by [CONTACT_406146] [ADDRESS_512054] with bolus tracking in the descending 
aorta, and a saline flush. A dual-phase or three-phase injection may be utilized depending upon 
local practice.  Nitroglycerin, either sublingual tablet or spray, may be used to improve coronary 
artery visualization according to local practice.  Patients with known sensitivity to nitroglycerin, 
hypotension (generally systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg), and those with a recent history of 
phosphodiesterase inhibitor use should not receive nitroglycerin.  
After the appropriate scan delay, an ECG-gated acquisition from the carina to the base of the 
heart will be performed. The use of radiation dose reduction techniques, including ECG-gated 
tube current modulation and low kVp scanning in smaller patients, is strongly encouraged.  Sites 
with hardware and software allowing prospectively ECG-triggered acquisitions, as well as 
appropriate clinical experience with this technique, may choose to use it in selected cases for 
dose reduction according to their clinical routine.  Image data will be reconstructed at multiple 
phases of the cardiac cycle and will be post-processed on a 3-D workstation using a variety of 
tools and applications depending upon local practice and availability. The imaging test will be 
considered positive if the participant has an equal to or greater than 50% stenosis of the right 
coronary, left main, left anterior descending, or circumflex arteries or of their first-order 
branches. Results will be communicated to the responsible ED staff immediately upon 
interpretation. Reporting of studies will be according to the AHA coronary segment model and 
will also include an assessment of global and regional cardiac function (when available), calcium 
score, mass, and volume, and additional cardiac and non-cardiac findings.  
The imaging protocol described above is the suggested imaging approach for this trial; however, 
sites with experience in CT coronary angiography may perform the scan according to their own 
protocol as long as both a pre-contrast acquisition for calcium scoring and a post-contrast 
acquisition for coronary angiography are obtained.  For applicable purposes, the decision to 
perform contrast-enhanced imaging in the presence of a large amount of calcium should be made 
according to the procedures for CT coronary angiography at each individual site. Studies must be 
reported according to the format found in the ACRIN data submission forms. 
 
The protocol required images must be in DICOM format on CD/DVD-ROM or submitted via the 
Internet using secure File Transfer Protocol (sFTP), and transmitted along with an Imaging 
Transmittal Worksheet (ITW) which can be found on the ACRIN PA 4005 web site 
(www.acrin.org/4005_protocol.aspx). The required images must be submitted to ACRIN 
Imaging Core Lab. ACRIN can provide electronic image submission and anonymity utilities for 
participating institutions via TRIAD software. For support in sending the images via the internet 
using TRIAD, contact [CONTACT_406147] (IMC) via email at

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING
10.1 Definition of Adverse Event
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory or physiological finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, 
regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution 
of unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite). Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be AEs if the abnormality: 
results in study withdrawal
is associated with a serious adverse event (SAE)
ACRIN PA 4005 24 March 10, 2010  
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
is associated with clinical signs or symptoms
leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests
is considered by [CONTACT_1372]
10.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: 
results in death, or  
is life-threatening (at the time of the event), or  
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324], or
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or  
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
10.3 Adverse Event Grading
Grade denotes the severity of the AE. An AE is graded using the CTEP Active version of the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), or the following categories (if the 
term does NOT appear in the CTEP Active version of the CTCAE):  
 
   1  Mild  
   2  Moderate 
   3  Severe 
   4  Life-threatening or disabling 
   5  Fatal 
(For terms listed in the CTEP Active version of the CTCAE, the grade is still recorded as 1, 2, 3, 
4, or 5; however, the definition of the various grades will be specific to the term being used.)
10.4 Adverse Event AttributionAttribution determines whether an AE is related to a study treatment or procedure. Attribution 
categories are: 
Definite   AE is clearly related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
Probable  AE  is likely related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
Possible   AE may be related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
Unlikely  AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
UnrelatedAE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment or procedure. 
10.5 Potential Expected and Unexpected Adverse Events
AEs may be expected  or unexpected :  
 
An expected AE  is one that is described in the prot ocol, the ICF, or the investigators 
clinical brochure.  
An unexpected AE  is one that has not been described in the protocol, the ICF, or the 
investigators clinical brochure.

10.6 GROUP A: Expected Adverse Events Associated With Standard of Care Practice
Any AE that is a result of standard of care practice (e.g. related to stress testing or cardiac 
catheterization) will be reported and managed pe r the institutions policies and procedures.  
10.7 GROUP B: Expected Adverse Events Associated With CT Angiography
Only adverse events that are considered possibly, probably, or definitely  related to the CT scan 
procedures require reporting to ACRIN. Please re fer to your local IRBs policies regarding AEs.

Allergic reaction (anaphylaxis or asthma). 
A history of contrast allergy excludes potential participants from this study. The injection 
may cause discomfort and irritation. The iodine-containing contrast used for CT scanning 
may cause significant contrast reactions in about one in a thousand (1:1,000) participants. 
Severe reaction is seen in as low as 4:10,000 to as high as 2:1,[ADDRESS_512059] been reported in 1:170,[ADDRESS_512060] common reactions are nausea,

performed for this protocol will be performed with application of all available methods 
for dose reduction, including but not limited to: 
1. CG-modulated tube current reduction during systole to 20% of the nominal

10.8 Recording of Adverse Events
Prompt reporting of AEs is the responsibility of each investigator, clinical research associate (RA), 
and/or nurse engaged in clinical research. Please refer to Sections 10.[ADDRESS_512064] 
ACRIN headquarters at [PHONE_4521] for assistance. However, an AE report should be submitted if 
there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_406100]. 
   
Routine reporting  is defined as documentation of AEs on source documents and the AE case report 
form (CRF), and submission to ACRIN for preparation of a report for DSMB review, and the final study 
report. 
 
Expedited reporting  is defined as immediate notification of ACRIN within the specified timeframe 
outlined in the protocol.  Routine reporting requirements also apply. 
At each contact (site visit and/or telephone) with the study participant, the investigator or investigator-
designee must seek information on AEs through discussion and, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. 
Information on all serious and non-serious, expected and unexpected AEs considered possibly, 
probably,  and/or definitely  related to the study components of the ACRIN PA 4005 trial with the 
severity level of grades 3, 4, or 5 should be recorded immediately into the source document (e.g. AE 
Log and/or progress notes of the study participants ch art) and retained at the site. These AEs will also 
be recorded in the AE CRF and reviewed by [CONTACT_406150]. If the AE meets the criteria for serious and requires expedited 
reporting, an ACRIN SAE Report will be completed (refer to Section 10.10 for detailed instructions).  
 
AEs already documented in an AE CRF (i.e., at a pr evious assessment) and designated as ongoing, 
should be reviewed at subsequent visits as necessary. If these have resolved, the documentation in the 
AE CRF should be completed including an end date for the event and not the date of the visit. If an 
adverse experience increases in frequency or severity during a study period, an up-to-date record of the 
experience will be documented. Each AE should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has

been determined that the study procedure or study participation is not the cause. Any SAE that occurs 
after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study procedures or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately. 
10.9 When to Report
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs (as identified in Section 10.6) that occur 
during the course of the study including any unexpected AEs with grades 3, 4, and 5 with attributions of 
possible, probable, and definite.  At each designated visit, the investigator will evaluate for any AEs. 
AEs not previously documented in the study will be recorded within the study participants chart to 
identify any potentially related to any study procedures. The nature of each event, date and time (when 
appropriate) of onset, outcome, frequency, maximum intensity, action taken, and attribution will be 
recorded. 
10.9.[ADDRESS_512065] use the following AE reporting criteria for all protocol-specific AEs/SAEs:  
1.Grade [ADDRESS_512066] 
knowledge of the event.   
 
10.9.2 Assignment of grades and attribution for each AE/SAE must be completed by [CONTACT_360950]. All AEs/SAEs should be documented in the study participants 
chart and CRFs. For expedited SAE reports, a copy of the report must be kept at the site. 
Significant new information on any on-going SAE should be promptly reported to 
ACRIN.

11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(International Conference of Harmonisation [ICH] guidelines), applicable government regulations, and 
ACRIN research policies and procedures. 
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) for formal approval of the study conduct. The decision of the IRB concerning the 
conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be 
provided to ACRIN before implementation of the study.  
 
The investigator will provide ACRIN with the institutions federal wide assurance (FWA) number, 
along with the IRB approval letter and copy of the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF). The 
investigator will provide a copy(s) of IRB approval letter(s) for any amendment(s), and copy(s) of 
annual renewal(s). 
 
All study participants in this study will be given an IRB-approved, site-specific ICF describing the study 
and providing sufficient information for participants to make informed decisions about their 
participation in this study (see Appendix I for an ICF template). The ICF will be submitted along with 
the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_1036]. The study participant MUST be consented with 
the EC/IRB-approved ICF before the participant is subjected to any study procedures. The IRB-
approved ICF MUST be signed and dated by [CONTACT_406151]-designated research staff obtaining the consent before the participant is subjected to 
any study procedures. Any revisions to the ICF at any time during the trial will need to be submitted to 
the IRB for approval and submission to ACRIN PDRC. 
12.[ADDRESS_512069]
Any investigator and/or research staff member who has a conflict of interest with this study (such as 
patent ownership, royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385]) 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512070] party without the consent of ACRIN, the Study Chair, and/or the ACRIN 
Publication Committee. Any investigator involved in this study is obligated to provide ACRIN with 
complete test results and all clinical data obtained from the participants in this protocol. Investigators 
will follow the ACRIN Publication Policy (available online at www.acrin.org/PublicationsPolicy.aspx ). 
  
14.0 INSTITUTIONAL MONITORING AND AUDITS
The investigator will permit study-related auditing and inspections of all study-related documents by [CONTACT_5040], government regulatory agencies, and ACRIN. The investigator will ensure the capability for 
inspection of all participating site s study-related facilities (e.g. imag ing centers, satellite sites). The 
investigator will allocate adequate time for these activities, allow access to all study-related documents 
and facilities, and provide adequate space to conduct these visits. 
 
To help sites prepare for monitoring and audits and to assure that the investigator and the research staff 
maintain records appropriately, ACRIN Headquarters will offer training to sites. This training will cover 
all aspects of data collection, including special instructions to obtain and file the various source 
documents needed to verify the accuracy of submitted data for this trial. Please refer to the study-
specific protocol and study-related documents for details.   
14.1 Monitoring  
Monitoring ensures protocol and regulatory compliance, particip ants welfare and safety, and 
provides resources to sites for clarification to the protocol and guidance in completion of the case 
report forms (CRFs). Monitoring of the protocol is implemented after the activation of the trial, 
and once participants have been enrolled into the study at each site. Each site will be informed 
when the monitoring of the protocol is implemented. Monitoring instructions will be sent to the 
site prior to the implementation of monitoring to aid in preparation for the monitoring. The 
instructions will specify regulatory documents and participant case records scheduled to be 
monitored. CRFs and source documents of selected study participants enrolled at each site will 
be reviewed. In addition, the initial regulatory documents and any revised regulatory documents 
will also be monitored. 
The ACRIN QA Monitor will review case report forms and source documents at several different 
time points: after first few participants enrolled and during the conduct of the trial, including 
staff changes at the participating sites. In addition, the QA Monitor will review the initial and 
annual regulatory documents and any revised regulatory documents. 
14.2 Auditing
All participating institutions that enroll participants will be audited.  The timing of the initial on-
site audit will depend upon several factors, including the rate of accrual (both study-wide and 
site-specific), the number of evaluable participants enrolled at an individual site, the status of the 
protocol and pending amendments, and monitoring status. Generally, audits will be conducted 
ACRIN PA 4005 30 March 10, 2010  
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
after the number of evaluable participants reaches 20% of targeted accrual, either study-wide 
and/or site-specific. Audits are typi[INVESTIGATOR_212516] [ADDRESS_512071] verify the eligibility criteria and data submitted on all CRFs. If an item 
is not mentioned (e.g., history and physical examination alluding to a condition, but no mention 
of a psychological condition), it will be assumed it is not present. 
Research records for each case should contain copi[INVESTIGATOR_212517]. If data are abstracted from medical charts that are not filed at 
the investigative sites (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]), copi[INVESTIGATOR_212518]. Every attempt must be made to obtain all records/charts that were used to abstract any 
study data for this protocol. This will prevent any discrepancies and the inability to verify the 
document and the data reported.  
14.4  Case Report Forms (CRFs)
CRFs, both web-based and paper forms, are the primary data collection instruments for the 
study. All data requested on the CRFs must be recorded, and any missing data must be 
explained. If a space is left blank on paper CRFs because the procedure was not done or the 
question was not asked, N/D must be noted. If the item is not applicable to the individual case, 
N/A must be noted. All entries on paper CRFs must be printed legibly in black ink on the 
paper CRFs. In the event of any entry errors, corrections must be made by [CONTACT_740] a single 
straight line through the incorrect entry, writing  the initials of the person making the 
correction, recording the date  when the correction is being made, and entering the correct data 
above the strike through. Do not use white out or an eraser. Please refer to ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines . 
 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512072] (such as participant history or official 
clinical interpretations of images, pathology, or surgery results) and recorded on the CRFs will 
be reviewed against the appropriate component of the medical record. Data elements gathered 
from signed participant questionnaires must be available for review. Required study image 
interpretation data that are more detailed in information than the image and not typi[INVESTIGATOR_406101] . At the time of audit, the auditor will verify 
the occurrence of the imaging examination, the reader, and the date of the exam(s) from the 
medical record(s). Any use of approved CRFs as source documentation require a signature [CONTACT_406172] a reference to the information source (participant questionnaire, CT, MR, 
etc.). Any use of CRFs as source documentation when the protocol has designated the source 
data will be medical record documentation will be considered a major protocol deficiency.

ACRIN, along with a copy of the IRB-approved, site-specific ICF. Investigator will provide a 
copy(s) of IRB approval letter(s) for any amendment(s), and copy(s) of annual renewal(s). 
 
15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
15.1 Study Design and Endpoints
Study participants will be recruited among those presenting in the Emergency Department with 
symptoms consistent with ACS. Participants will be randomized to either a traditional rule out 
approach based on institutional standard of care (Group A) or to a CT coronary angiography-
based rule out strategy (Group B) . Participants will be followed for one year after their index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406102], health care utilization, and cost.  
 
15.1.1 Primary Endpoint
[IP_ADDRESS] The primary endpoint will be major cardiac event (cardiac death or AMI) 
within [ADDRESS_512074] significant 
coronary artery disease. Significant coronary artery disease is defined as 
greater than or equal to 50% stenosis of the left main, left anterior descending 
(LAD), left circumflex, right coronary artery (RCA), or their first order 
branches.

[IP_ADDRESS] Major cardiac events experienced during [ADDRESS_512077] review.  
15.2 Specific Aims and Analysis Plans
15.2.1 Primary Aim 
To estimate the rate of major cardiac events (AMI or cardiac death) within [ADDRESS_512078] confidence interval for this proportion will be derived and the hypothesis that the 
proportion exceeds 1% will be tested using a one-sided exact test.  In a secondary 
analysis, factors possibly related to occurrence of major cardiac events will be examined 
using exact logistic regression modeling.    
15.2.2 Secondary Aims [IP_ADDRESS] To estimate and compare the rates of significant coronary artery disease 
detected within the index visit in participants across the two study groups.
The analysis for this secondary aim will be performed from the intent-to-treat 
perspective. Diagnosis of significant coronary artery disease will be determined 
via review of medical records. Rates of significant CAD will be estimated for 
each study Group and will be compared.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  To compare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406104]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406105]. 
 
The analysis for this secondary aim will be performed from the intent-to-treat 
perspective. Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (LOS) for each participant will be 
computed based on medical record information. After a graphical exploration of 
the data using Kaplan Meier curves,   LOS will be compared across the two 
study arms using a non-parametric procedure. 
[IP_ADDRESS] To compare health care utilization and cost of care in the two study groups 
during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
The analysis for this secondary aim will be performed from the intent-to-treat 
perspective. Health care utilization will be assessed using medical record 
review. The main components of health care utilization will be cardiac-related 
lab tests, diagnostic imaging tests, interventions, repeat ED visits for cardiac 
related problems, and repeat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406106]. Cost of care will

aggregated for each patient over the entire length of the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Measures of key components of utilization will be compared across the two 
study groups using procedures appropriate for each measure (rate or count). 
Costs will be compared non-parametrically between the two study groups. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] To compare cardiac health care utilization and cost of care in the two study 
arms during [ADDRESS_512080] randomization. Health care utilization components will 
include cardiac-related lab tests, diagnostic (imaging) tests, interventions, 
repeat ED visits that for cardiac related problems, and repeat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406107]. 
The analysis for this secondary aim will be performed from the intent-to-treat 
perspective and will parallel the analysis for Secondary Aim #3. Utilization and 
cost will be assessed during over a full year period from the index 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
[IP_ADDRESS] To compare the two study groups in terms of the respective rates of major 
cardiac events (cardiac death, AMI, and revascularization )within [ADDRESS_512081] procedures. In a secondary analysis, the rates of each type of 
major cardiac event will be examined separately. 
15.3 Sample Size/Accrual RateStudy participants will be recruited and randomized in 1:[ADDRESS_512082] 4 
institutions. 
15.4 Power Consideration
15.4.1 Primary Aim    
The primary aim of the study is to estimate the rate of major cardiac events (cardiac death 
or AMI) within [ADDRESS_512083] significant coronary artery disease during their index admission. An 
important question in this context is whether the rate of major cardiac events exceeds 
0.01. Because the primary aim is focused on Group B patients, the randomization will be 
done in a 1:2 ratio between groups A and B.   
ACRIN PA 4005 34 March 10, 2010  
 
CONFIDENTIAL 
The following table presents estimates of the sample size of participants without major 
coronary artery disease required in order to achieve power of 90% for testing the null 
hypothesis that rate of major cardiac events exceeds 0.01. The calculations are based on 
an exact one-sided test of the null hypothesis at level 0.05.  
Power Sample Size True rate of  major 
cardiac events 
0.[ADDRESS_512084] that up to 10% of participants will be found to have 
significant coronary artery disease.  We also expect that the true rate of major cardiac 
events will be very low and not higher than 2/1000. Under these assumptions, a sample 
size of [ADDRESS_512085] 90% to reject 
the null hypothesis if the true rate is 2/1000. Allowing for a 5% attrition from the 
originally enrolled population, we arrived at a final sample size of [ADDRESS_512086] $600 and more likely 
about $[ADDRESS_512087] deviation in each arm to range from 
$2500 to $3500.  Under these assumptions, the proposed sample size will provide power 
at least 83%, using a two-sided test of size 0.05. The power will be very high (above 
99%) to detect a difference in average cost of $1,000. 
Also, for the comparison of rates of major cardiac events during one year from the index 
admission, we expect that the rate in Group A will be from 2% to 5% and in Group B 
about 1%. The following table presents power estimates for the comparison of the 
indicated rates. 
The computations are based on a two-sided test of level 0.05, using the un-pooled 
estimate of the variance. The proposed sample size will provide power of about 76% to 
compare the two groups if the rates are 0.04 and 0.01, respectively. The power will 
increase to 90% if the rate in Group A will be 0.05.   If the rate in Group A falls below 
0.04, the needed sample size to ensure power 80% will be considerably higher than the 
projected sample size for the study.

SAMPLE CONSENT FOR RESEARCH STUDY 
Randomized Controlled Study of a Rapid “Rule Out” Strategy  
Using CT Coronary Angiogram Versus Traditional Care
for Low- to Intermediate-Risk ED Patients with Potential Acute Coronary Syndromes
[Note:  The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) complies with the privacy 
measures put forth by [CONTACT_154213] (HIPAA).  
However, ACRIN does not monitor compliance with HIPAA; that is the responsibility of  
the local institutions and their Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). Local IRBs may choose  
to combine the authorization elements in the informed consent.] 
The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) is conducting a research study known 
as a clinical trial. Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time in 
deciding whether you want to be involved in the clinical trial. You are encouraged to discuss your 
decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care team. If you have 
any questions, you should ask your study doctor for more explanation. If you decide to do this study, 
you will be asked to sign and date this form. 
 
You are being invited to participate in this research study because you may have a heart condition.  The 
treating doctor who is caring for you in the Emergency Department believes you might have acute 
coronary syndrome, a heart condition that can cause chest pain and other symptoms because the heart is 
not getting enough blood. Acute coronary syndrome is caused by [CONTACT_80924]-up of plaque in arteries that 
deliver blood to the heart; this plaque can cause the pathways to narrow or be completely blocked. Heart 
attacks, also called myocardial infarctions  or MIs , can be caused by [CONTACT_406154]. 
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this study is to determine if an imaging procedure called computed tomography (CT) 
coronary angiography, or simply called CT angiography, can safely and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_406112] a persons chest pain is  related to a heart problem. Your study doctors want to see if the CT scan can 
safely provide enough information to Emergency Department doctors to send people at low- to 
intermediate-risk for acute coronary syndrome home without having to stay overnight in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
This study will compare the effectsgood and badof tw o different ways of diagnosing heart disease 
in the Emergency Department. People who agree to join this study will be randomly selected to receive a 
CT scan or to undergo routine care. In the one year that follows this Emergency Department visit, your 
study and treating doctors will check to see if you need other tests and/or treatment for your heart after 
you leave the Emergency Department. 
About CT Coronary Angiography 
CT coronary angiography is a heart-imaging technique that allows doctors to see your heart without 
having to put any tubes in the body. It is a type of x-ray that can take as little as about [ADDRESS_512094] Agent
In order to better distinguish healthy tissues(s) from disease on the CT angiogram, an intravenous (IV) 
contrast agent will be used. The contrast agent (dye) used in CT, although very safe, has been associated 
with allergic reactions. Allergic reactions to these types of contrast agents are rare and most are mild, 
but some can be life threatening. Every effort will be made to screen you for allergies before an agent is 
given. 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?
About [ADDRESS_512095] four emergency departments.   
 
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?
You will be directly in the study for about one (1) year, starting with the day you come to the 
Emergency Department. This may include contact[CONTACT_406155]. Whether you are admitted to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406113], your study doctors 
will want to gather information about your heart health. The study team will contact [CONTACT_406156] 30 days 
and one (1) year after you are released from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The trial will continue for about two (2) to 
three (3) years.  
 
This study is expected to end after all study participants have completed the visits and all the 
information has been collected. The study may be stopped at any time by [CONTACT_406157]:  
 Your health or safety may be at risk; 
You have not been following study instruction; 
A study administrative decision has been made by [CONTACT_406158]. 
 
These actions do not require your consent, but you will be informed of any of these decisions.

WHAT AM I BEING ASKED TO DO IN THE STUDY?
If you agree to take part in this study and determined to be eligible by [CONTACT_6814], you will be 
asked to read and sign this consent form before you are enrolled to participate in this trial and before any 
study procedures are performed.  When you are enrolled into the study, you have the following tests and 
procedures. <<Next sentence for the blood banking procedure will only apply for institutions that are 
participating in the blood banking component of the trial.  Those who are not participating, please 
remove.>> As part of this study and if you agree, blood samples will be taken and will be sent and 
stored at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406114].     
 
See the Study Chart at the end of this section for a visit-by-visit outline of what will be expected of you 
if you decide to participate in this trial. 
Standard medical procedures that are part of regular standard of care and would probably be 
done even if you do not join the study : A review of your medical history; 
A physical examination, including vital signs; 
Blood tests; 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) to test th e hearts electrical pattern; 
Blood pressure tests. 
 
Medical procedures that are being done specifically because you are in this study ( these may or 
may not be done if you were not in this study): 
Blood samples collection and storage for future research (optional); 
Pregnancy test for female participants of childbearing age, as appropriate, immediately prior 
to CT angiography; 
CT angiography; 
Telephone follow up to discuss your heart health at 30 days and 1 year from the time you 
enter the study; 
Medical record review, as needed to confirm heart-related testing and treatment, at 30 days 
and 1 year after entering the study. 
 
Blood sample collection – this is an optional procedure:
<<Following language for the blood collection procedure will only apply for institutions that are 
participating in the blood banking component of the trial.  Those institutions who are not participating, 
please remove.>>  
 
If you are a patient at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406115], your study doctors would like to collect and store your blood that may be later used to look for 
changes in blood associated with acute coronary syndrome.  This is an optional procedure in this study, 
so you may choose to be in the study but not to have the blood sample collection. Time may not allow 
for all of the blood samples to be taken, so you may not have three blood draws. If you agree, the blood

When you get your 1st blood test as part of your treatment; 
About [ADDRESS_512098]; 
About [ADDRESS_512099] or prior to being discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
The blood sample will be given only to the approved researchers and will not be sold.  The research 
done on the blood will also be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_3021]s institutional review board 
(IRB).  The research done with your blood will probably not help you but it may help other people who 
have a heart condition in the future.  Reports about the research done with your blood will not be given 
to you or your treating doctor.  These reports will not be put into your medical records and it will not 
have an effect on your care.   
 
I agree to participate in the blood sample collection and storage for future research portion of this 
study.
 YES            NO     Participant’s Initials 
 
If you agree to participate in this study, you will be assigned to one of two different study groups. It is 
important to know that the study doctors and staff who are conducting this trial will not choose which of 
these two groups you will be placed into. Instead, you will be placed randomly into one of the groups. 
The study group (A or B) that you will be assigned will be determined randomly like a coin flip. In this 
study, the coin flip will make you twice as likely to  be in Group B than in Group A (see descriptions 
below). 
 
For Group A (Standard Care)
If you are put into Group A (what is know as the control group), you will receive standard of care as 
determined by [CONTACT_406159], which includes a blood test and ECG.  Your treating 
doctors may determine that no additional testing is needed per standard of care; or, may find it necessary 
to test your heart with a cardiac stress test or cardiac catheterization. 
 
In addition, if you agree to the blood collection, you will have one tube of blood taken from a vein in 
your arm (about 1 tablespoon of blood) three times over the first 6 hours of your visit. Your blood 
sample will be stored at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406116].  
 
For Group B (Standard Care + CT Scan)
If you are put into Group B, you will receive standard of care as determined by [CONTACT_406160], which includes a blood test and ECG.  After the results of your 1st blood test, you will receive a 
CT scan of your chest/heart.   
 
If your CT scan results come back negative, you will be released from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406117]. If your 
CT coronary angiography results come back positive, then you will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406118] [ADDRESS_512100] another tube of blood taken from a vein in your arm (about 1 
tablespoon of blood).  You will have blood taken about two (2) other times over the first 6 hours of your 
visit. Your blood sample will be stored at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406119]. 
 
Both Groups A and B
Regardless of which group you are in, your treating doctor(s) will want to gather information about your 
heart health, including what tests and treatments you have had and whether youve returned to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], after you leave the Emergency Department. We will ask you to provide your contact 
[CONTACT_3031], including your mailing address, and the name [CONTACT_406173](s) we can contact 
[CONTACT_406161]. We may need to 
access your medical records at facilities outside of this one. Whether you are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406120], the research staff will contact [CONTACT_406162](s) about 30 days and about one (1) year after the date you entered the trial.

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS OF THE STUDY?
While on the study, you may be at risk for these side effects if you have the following procedures. You 
should discuss these with your study and/or treating doctor(s). There also may be other side effects that 
ACRIN PA [ADDRESS_512101] scan is stopped, but in some cases 
side effects can be serious, long lasting, or permanent.   
Risks Associated With Intravenous (IV) Catheter Placement 
for Contrast Agent and/or Blood Collection
Likely
Minor discomfort; 
Bruising; 
Pain in the injection site. 
 
Rare
Fainting; 
Bleeding; 
Infection. 
Risks Associated With the Contrast Agent for the CT Scans
Rare
Nausea; 
Vomiting; 
Hives; 
Rash. 
 
Very Rare, Potentially Life Threatening 
Allergic reaction; 
Kidney failure; 
Malfunction of worn or implanted electronic medical devices. 
 
When you receive the contrast during the CT scan, you may experience a warm or hot sensation and/or a 
metallic taste in your mouth. These are normal reactions and are not dangerous.  
If you experience an allergic reaction, with the CT contrast agent, you will be treated for the reaction.  If 
you have allergies or have had an allergic reaction to contrast in the past, please notify your study doctor 
and research staff who are explaining this study. 
 
If you wear or have electronic medical devices implanted such as a pacemaker or a drug pump, please 
make sure you tell your study doctors and research staff.  It was recently reported by [CONTACT_406166].

Radiation Risks
<<Each site may need to modify this section to quote the correct CT dosimetry for its own cardiac CT 
scanner in accordance with its own institutional policies and procedures. The following language and 
dosing range is an example only.>> 
For example:There are some risks from the CT scans used to evaluate your heart health in this study. This research 
study involves exposure to radiation from the CT angiogram and therefore you will receive a radiation 
dose. Radiation dose associated with this study will range from approximately 2 mSv to 21 mSv. This is 
often less than the radiation ( 10–22  mSv) a patient is exposed to when they have images taken before 
and after a stress test, called a nuclear stress test, which is currently one of the most widely used tests 
for diagnosing heart disease. At doses much higher than you will receive, radiation is known to increase 
the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_406122]. The dose that you will receive will very likely have no 
effects at all. Measures are taken to ensure that you are an appropriate candidate for these tests and 
that the risks to you are minimal.
Reproductive Risks
Because possible exposure to radiation can damage an unborn baby, you will need to inform your study 
doctor or research staff if you are pregnant or suspect that you may be pregnant. If you are pregnant, you 
will not be able to participate in this study.  If you are unsure, you will need to have a negative 
pregnancy result per the usual standard of care prior to enrolling and/or prior to imaging in this trial. 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. 
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. The potential benefit to you may be that 
your treating doctors are able to determine faster whether or not your symptoms are related to your heart. 
This may decrease time and money for you and other patients with similar issues. We hope the information 
learned from this study will benefit other patients with potential heart problems in the future. 
 
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE?
You may choose not to take part in this study. If you choose not to participate, there will be no penalty 
or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Please talk with your study and/or treating 
doctor(s) about this and other options.

as much of the chest as breathholding permits) for the purpose of calcium scoring, and to evaluate lung 
abnormalities. This will be followed by [CONTACT_406168] [ADDRESS_512109] with bolus tracking in the descending aorta, and a saline flush. A dual-phase or three-phase 
injection may be utilized depending upon local practice. Nitroglycerin, either sublingual tablet or spray, 
may be used to improve coronary artery visualization according to local practice.  Patients with known 
sensitivity to nitroglycerin, hypotension (generally systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg), and those 
with a recent history of phosphodiesterase inhibitor use should not receive nitroglycerine. 
After the appropriate scan delay, an ECG-gated acquisition from the carina to the base of the heart will 
be performed. The use of radiation dose reduction techniques, including ECG-gated tube current 
modulation and low kVp scanning in smaller patients, is strongly encouraged.  Sites with hardware and 
software allowing prospectively ECG-triggered acquisitions, as well as appropriate clinical experience 
with this technique, may choose to use it in selected cases for dose reduction according to their clinical 
routine. Image data will be reconstructed at multiple phases of the cardiac cycle and will be post-
processed on a 3-D workstation using a variety of tools and applications depending upon local practice 
and availability. The imaging test will be considered positive if the participant has an equal to or greater 
than 50% stenosis of the right coronary, left main, left anterior descending, or circumflex arteries or of 
their first-order branches. Results will be communicated to the responsible Emergency Department staff

immediately upon interpretation. Reporting of studies will be according to the AHA coronary segment 
model and will also include an assessment of global and regional cardiac function (when available), 
calcium score, mass, and volume, and additional cardiac and non-cardiac findings.

BLOOD PROCESSING/BANKING PROTOCOL
University of Pennsylvania Health System 
Laboratory Testing:
Initial cardiac marker testing will be performed in accordance with institutional protocols. At HUP, this 
will be on the Biosite point-of-care testing machine. Reference ranges will be those that are set by [CONTACT_406169]. For all participants who consent to the blood collection, the 
quantitative results will be immediately presented to the attending physician responsible for patient care. 
The initial serum sample (0 minutes), as well as samples taken at approximately 90 to 180 minutes, and 
6 hours, will be banked for future use.  
 
Processing:
Study specimens will be collected at HUP and PPMC sites and will be sent to the designated storage 
facility for storage for future testing.  
 
Blood is to be collected in a 5.[ADDRESS_512110] all unused bar 
codes after each sample is processed.  
 
It is preferable that the specimens be frozen at -70 degrees Celsius (-70º C) however, if this is not 
available at your site, the plasma may be frozen at -20 degrees Celsius (-20º C). If freezing and storing 
the specimens at -20º C please use a non-defrosting freezer and do not store the specimens on the door 
shelf of the freezer. 
 
Locally stored samples will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_406124]. Samples will be 
transported by [CONTACT_406170]. They will be stored at -70 
degrees Celsius (-70º C) until analysis. 
 
Blood specimens collected during this study will be stored and investigated later for cardiac markers, 
neurohormonal markers, and markers of inflammation.

STANDARDIZED CARDIAC DIAGNOSIS DEFINITIONS
NOTE: These definitions may differ from standard practice at your site and are to be used for reporting 
of data to ACRIN for this trial. 
AMI (Acute Myocardial Infarction) 
Elevated cardiac troponin above lab threshold for normal (0.4) in setting of symptoms with or without 
ECG changes. 
STEMI (ST segment elevation MI) 
AMI subcategory where the patient has new ST segment elevation  on the ECG at the time of 
presentation to the ED (ECG impression of c/w AMI or ST elevation greater than 1mm on ECG 
form). 
NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation MI) 
AMI subcategory where the patient does NOT have ST segment elevation on the ECG at the 
time of presentation to the ED (ECG impression of c/w AMI or ST elevation greater than 1mm 
on ECG form).  
Unstable Angina (UA) 
Stress test with reversible ischemia:  
oReversible perfusion defect on nuclear imaging;  
oReversible wall motion abnormality on stress echocardiography; or  
oTransient ECG changes alone, if no imaging performed; 
Cardiac catheterization with a lesion >  70%; 
CT Angiography with a lesion >  70%. 
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) 
Anyone with AMI (STEMI or NSTEMI) or UA. 
Stable Angina 
Patients with known AMI, UA, ACS who have symptoms less severe than their typi[INVESTIGATOR_406125].

2 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
Significance of Research Question/Purpose: 
 Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186295]19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying 
infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission.  Once exposed, observation is 
standard-of- care. 
No effective therapy curr ently exists for treatment.  The lack of effective therapy 
diminishes persons presenting post- exposure for self-quarantine. Having an effective post -
exposure prophylaxis, even if only partially effective, may additionally create synergy for the 
public heal th strategy of case identification and isolation –  if a safe prophylaxis is available.  
People who develop COVID -19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, 
including mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_186296], after an average of 5-6 days after exposure (i.e. mean incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between 1 to 14 days.[1] 
Most people infected with the COVID -[ADDRESS_220170] mild disease and recover. 
Approximately 80% of laboratory -confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, 
which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 
6% are critically ill with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction [1] . 
Preliminary Data: 
Chloroquine has  in vitro activity in cell lines against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2. In a 
Vero E6 cell line, the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) activity of chloroquine was 
1.[ADDRESS_220171] SARS -CoV2 [2]. Hydroxychloroquine is functionally equivalent as chloroquine.   
Another compound under treatment trials, remdesivir ([COMPANY_009]) had an EC50 of 0.77 μM 
[2].  Remdesivir ([COMPANY_009]) is not FDA -approved and in limited quantities.  Hydroxychloroquine is 
FDA-approved and globally is inexpensive.  Chloroquine is no longer broadly available in the 
[LOCATION_003].  
Existing Literature: 
Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] -ritonavir, corticosteroids, have been 
used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy is poorly understood as a gold 
standard randomized clinical trial has not been conducted.  
After the original 2003 SARS outbreak, screening of compounds was performed.  The 
Special Pathogens Branch of the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia investigated chloroquine.  
COVID -[ADDRESS_220172] -infection chloroquine treatment was 
effective in vitro at preventing the spread of SARS -CoV infection in an in vitro cell -based 
system [3].  Vincent et al reported: 
“In order to investigate the antiviral properties of chloroquine on SARS -
CoV after the initiation of infection, Vero E6 cells were infected with the virus and 
fresh medium supplemented with various concentrations of chloroquine was 
added immediately after virus adsorption. Infected cells were incubated for an additional 16– [ADDRESS_220173] immunofluorescence analysis. When chloroquine was added after the initiation of infection, there was a dramatic dose-dependent decrease i n the 
number of virus antigen- positive cells ( Fig. 2A ). As little as 0.1– 1 μM chloroquine 
reduced the infection by 50% and up to 90– 94% inhibition was observed with 33–
100 μM concentrations ( Fig. 2B ). At concentrations of chloroquine in excess of [ADDRESS_220174] (EC50) was estimated to occur at 4.4 ± 1.0 μM chloroquine ( Fig. 2C ). 
These data clearly  show that the addition of chloroquine can effectively reduce 
the establishment of infection and spread of SARS -CoV if the drug is added 
immediately following virus adsorption.” [3] 
Figure 2. Post -infection chloroquine treatment reduces SARS -CoV.

Vincent et al also reported: “Since we observed antiviral effects  by [CONTACT_186327], we further extended the analysis by [CONTACT_186328] 3 
and 5 h after virus adsorption and examined for the presence of virus antigens after 20 h. We 
found that chloroquine was still significantly effective even when added 5 h after infection (Fig. 3); however, to obtain equivalent antiviral effect, a higher concentration of chloroquine was 
required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after adsorption.” [3]  
  
Further experiments demonstrated that chloroquine impaired the terminal glycosylation 
of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is the binding site for the envelope 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_92189] -CoV and SAR -CoV2 [3]. 
Conversely, chloroquine did not have activity against Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_18960] (MERS -CoV), which may be related to 
MERS binding to CD26 receptor protein [4].  
 In a March 9, [ADDRESS_220176] greater activity 
than chloroquine [5]. The SARS -CoV-2 EC 50 values 
for hydroxychloroquine were 6.14 μM at 24 hours 
and 0.72 μM at 48 hours, [5]. Conversely, 
chloroquine EC50 values were >100 μM at 24 ho urs 
and 18.01 μM at 48 hours [5]. This inhibition assay 
was performed with Vero cells using an infectious 
dose of [ADDRESS_220177] SARS -CoV -2 in vitro [5].  
 
 

COVID -[ADDRESS_220178] been summarized by 
[CONTACT_186329]. as of April 15, 2020 [6].  To date, there is no conclusive evidence of clinical benefit  
of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643].   
There have been no studies of early therapy or preventative therapy.

 Chloroquine (CQ)  
Gao J et 
al. [12] CQ was stated to be sup erior to standard 
of care treatment in preventing exacerbation of pneumonia, reducing days to conversion rate, and shortening time to clinical recovery.  Combined patients 
from various ongoing studies.  
 No statistical methodology.  Interim 
report  [ADDRESS_220180] is 10.5% (95%CI, 2.9 to 31.4%) [13].  Among all close contacts, the 
SARS- CoV2 transmission rate is estimated at 0.45% (95%CI, 0.12 to 1.6%) by [CONTACT_6750]. These 
estimates are based on monitoring of travel -associated COVID19 cases. Conversely, in a 
setting with community transmission, the secondary attack rate in China was 35% (95%CI, 27-44%) based on [ADDRESS_220181]-
exposure prophylaxis / preemptive therapy.  
Standard malaria treatment dosing is: 
● 800mg once, then 400mg in 6-8 hours, then 400mg daily x 2 days  (3 days in total).  
We propose to dose for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_220182]-exposure prophylaxis at: 
● 800mg once, then 600mg in 6-8 hours, then 600mg daily x 4 days ( 5 days  in total).  
The projected levels achieved will be approximately 4.4 µM which is at or above the half 
maximal effective concentration (EC50) where 50% v iral inhibition would occur.  A delayed start 
to prophylaxis will be occurring -- based on the intrinsic delay from the exposure to case 
notification to trial enrollment, and to receipt of the first medication dose.  Thereby, higher doses 
may be necessary as seen in the CDC study [3] . Thus a malaria loading dose sequence will be 
used, but with higher daily doses thereafter to target reaching the above the EC50.   
As the incubation period is 2-[ADDRESS_220183]. (<=3 days is an 
inclusion criteria).  We recognize this may turn “post-exposure prophylaxis” into more of a 
“preemptive therapy” for some subjects who rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186297]. If 
hydroxychloroquine does not prevent disease for some, preemptive therapy may ameliorate the 
COVID19 disease severity. Attenuated disease may in turn be associated with reduced rates of 
transmission. 
 
COVID -[ADDRESS_220184] common reported side effects include:  
● headache, dizziness, ringing in your ears; 
● nausea, vomiting, stomach pain;  
● loss of appetite, weight loss;  
● mood changes, feeling nervous or irritable;  
● skin rash or itching; or  
● hair loss.  
GI side effects are minimized when taken with a meal or with milk. Antacid medications 
should be spaced apart by [CONTACT_2669] 4 hours.  
 
Potential adverse effects by [CONTACT_57501], as listed on the FDA package insert: 
○ Eye: “Chloroquine retinopathy” is a rare side-effect of chronic use after multiple years 
of use. This has not occurred with <1 year of continuous use. 
 
○ Dermatologic Reactions: Bleaching of hair, alopecia, pruritus, skin and mucosal 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], photosensitivity, and skin eruptions  (urticarial, morbilliform, lichenoid, 
maculopapular, purpuric, erythema annulare centrifugum, Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and exfoliative dermatitis). 
 ○ Hematologic Reactions: Various blood dyscrasias such as aplas tic anemia, 
agranulocytosis, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (hemolysis in individuals with glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G -6-PD) deficiency).  
 ○ Gastrointestinal Reactions: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Isolated cases  of abnormal liver function and fulminant hepatic failure.  
 
○ Cardiac Reactions: Long-term use (>1 year) has been associated with the 
development of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.  Specifically, chronic use has been 
associated with a mean +25msec prolongation of the QT interval after a median use 
of 3.5 years in patients with autoimmune diseases.  In a 2018 review of short term 
antimalarial treatment trials (n=1076 with chloroquine), no serious cardiac adverse 
events were reported among 35,548 participants [14]  
 
○ Allergic Reactions: Urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported 
 
○ Central Nervous System  Reactions: Irritability, nervousness, emotional changes, 
nightmares, psychosis, headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus, nerve 
deafness, convulsions, ataxia 
○ Miscellaneous Reactions:  Weight loss, lassitude, exacerbation or precipi[INVESTIGATOR_186298]-light-sensitive psoriasis. Possible Hypoglycemia in persons with 
diabetes

 24 April 2020  
9 On 24 April 2020, FDA issued a caution:  
 
FDA cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID -19 outside of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186299] a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems 
Close supervision is strongly recommended 
 
“The FDA is aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID -
[ADDRESS_220186] more infor mation.”  
 
“Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as QT 
interval prolongation and a dangerously rapid heart rate called ventricular tachycardia.  
These risks may increase when these medicines are combined with other medici nes 
known to prolong the QT interval, including the antibiotic azithromycin, which is also 
being used in some COVID -[ADDRESS_220187] other health issues such as heart and kidney disease are likely  to be at 
increased risk of these heart problems when receiving these medicines.”  
 
Mitigation of Risk:  The inclusion / exclusion criteria exclude cardiac risk factors, 
chronic kidney disease, and anti -arrhythmia medicines. On 24 April, additional QT 
prolonging medicines are excluded.    
 
2.3.2 Known Potential Benefits  
● There are no known benefits in humans for preemptive treatment.  
● In vitro antiviral activity against SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV2 viruses. 
● Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have a long history of safe, effective 
use as an antimalarial, both acutely and long-term use. 
● Chloroquine is being used therapeutically for severe COVID -19 disease in 
China and Korea.  
● Commonly used as a chronic medication for autoimmune disorders 
(rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus).  
● Recent studies have shown potential broad antiviral effects in vitro at 
dosages below currently recommended clinical dosing, reducing risk of 
potential adverse effects listed above.

10 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
To determine if hydroxychloroquine is effective at prevention of COVID -19 disease or 
reducing disease severity.  
3.2 Study Outcome Measures 
3.2.1 Primary Outcome Measures  
 
Asymptomatic Cohort  
● Incidence of COVID -19 disease within 14 days (among those asymptomatic 
at baseline)  
Symptomatic Cohort  
• Change in symptom severity score (visual analog scale 0-10) over 14 days  
3.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
● Incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] 
● Incidence of confirmed SARS -CoV-2 detection  
● Incidence of symptoms compatible with COVID -19 (possible disease)  
● Incidence of all -cause study medicine discontinuation or withdrawal  
● Incidence of adverse reactions  
● Symptom severity on day 5 or 14 via visual analog scale  
● Ordinal Scale of COVID -19  Disease Severity at day 14 (among those 
who are symptomatic at trial entry)  
Illness without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186300] (or post- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345])  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186301]-report.  As necessary, 
COVID19 disease will be verified from public health records, medical records, or death certificates. The primary endpoints are different for the two cohorts (those who are 
asymptomatic with known exposure; or those who are symptomatic at trial entry), and analyses will be done separately for the two cohorts. 
The primary analysis will use PCR+ confirmed di sease.  However if the absence of 
sufficient testing supplies continues then outpatients will not be offered SARS -CoV -2 
testing unless they are sick enough to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  In that case an alternate a priori 
planned analysis will define incident COVID19 disease as a composite of SARS -CoV-2 
PCR+ confirmed result OR symptomatic disease (i.e. possible) COVID -[ADDRESS_220189]  Version 2.3  
 24 April 2020  
11 4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
There are two strata: 1) asymptomatic healthcare workers or household contacts 
exposed to COVID -19 (n=1500) ; 2) symptomatic COVID -19 disease (n=1500) . Follow 
up will occur up to 90 days for those with symptomatic COVID -19 disease who become 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].   
 
4.1 DESIGN  
Randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial, parallel design 
 
• Intervention Arm: Hydroxychloroquine 800 mg orally once (4 tablets) , followed in 6 to 8 
hours by 600 mg (3 tabelts) , then 600 mg once a day for 4 consecutive days (5 days in 
total)  
• Control Arm: Vitamin Placebo 4 tablets orally once, followed in 6 to 8 hours by 3 tablets, 
then 3 tablets once a day for 4 consecutive days (5 days in total)

4.2 Study participant duration  
● 14 days consisting of internet-based virtual visits  
● For participants ill with COVID -19 disease who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (an SAE) , 
observational follow up will ex tend to up to 90 days to assess final outcome status  of 
their SAE.  
● Pregnant women have their fetal outcome assessed postpartum  to exclude a 
teratogenic SAE . 
4.3 Study procedures  
• All procedures will consist of internet -based questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_6270]-report.  
• Informed consent is provided to access medical records to verify information, as 
necessary.  
• Optional : blood spot will be collected at approximately day 14. 
• Optional: daily cardiac monitoring with remote EKG reads of QTc interval. 
4.4 Individually identifiable health information:  
Name, date of birth, addresses, and phone number will be collected so as to prescribe 
study medication. Email addresses will be collected for communication. If participants 
are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186302].  
4.5 Substudies (if applicable) 
Additional sub-studies will undergo separate IRB approval, and these studies will involve 
separate informed consent. Consented participants will be queried as to if they wish to participate in future research.   
1) Sero logy for Coronavirus Antibodies: New Participants  will be offer an optional 
participation in self-collection of dried blood spots in order to measure serologies for antibodies. Participants who have already been consented and entered the trial, will 
be approached for amendment of consent.  The purpose of serology testing is two-
fold: First, to verify infection. Second, the prevalence of antibodies will be compared among symptomatic and asymptomatic persons with a scientific question of how 
many asymptomatic  persons seroconvert after a high risk exposure in the absence of 
symptomatic illness.  The exact serology methodology to be conducted will be 
determined, based on availability and diagnostic performance. Blood spot collection 
materials (e.g. 18g lancet, filter paper, bandaid, instructions, and return envelope).   
(Optional)  
2) Cardiac Monitoring with handheld EKG to check cardiac QTc interval once daily for 
the first 7 days as a safety substudy. (Optional)

Rationale for inclusion / exclusion criteria:  
* As of 20 March 2020, testing is limited in many U.S. states and locales due to 
insufficient supplies. Thus, outpatient testing may not be available. A person with known exposure to a confirmed COVID -19 case with subsequent compatible symptoms is 
eligible for enrollment, if testing is not available. If a symptomatic person tests negative 
for SAR S-CoV-2, they are not eligible for enrollment.  
Mean Incubation period is ~5.2 days, thus we wish to limit enrollment to those with a 
higher risk of progression and deliver study medicine in a time period to intervene to 
prevent disease or ameliorate disease (i.e. start of study medicine by <=4 days after 
exposure). The current (as of March 17, 2020) delays in testing makes this window 
particularly tight, and it may need to be relaxed in the future via protocol amendment.  
In clinical practice of tropi[INVESTIGATOR_186303], chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are 
prescribed without any baseline laboratory testing or monitoring.   
Chronic use of hydroxychloroquine for >1 year can cause retinopathy or 
cardiomyopathy, thus persons with baseline conditions will be excluded.  Study medicine 
is excreted via the kidney with dose reduction recommended in CrCl <30 cc/mi n (Stage 
4 Kidney Disease).  G -6-PD deficiency is listed as a caution on the FDA label. G -6-PD 
testing is not routinely performed in clinical care prior to giving hydroxychloroquine 
prescriptions (unlike with primaquine).  Medication exclusions are for pos sible drug-drug 
interactions, particularly with cardiac arrhythmia medicines with a caution on the FDA -
package insert. 
On April 20, 2020, FDA mandated exclusion of structural or ischemic heart disease; or 
personal or family history of prolonged QT. 
On Apri l 24, 2020, FDA issued a caution for QT prolongation in persons with heart 
disease, chronic kidney disease, or taking other QT prolonging medicines. 
 
5.3 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
5.3.1 Randomization Procedures  
Participants will be randomized via permuted block randomization. Randomization 
will be recorded on an electronic log by [CONTACT_1714]. Study investigators and 
subjects will be blinded.  There will be separate randomization schedules for the 
two cohorts (as ymptomatic with exposure or symptomatic).  
Masking Procedures 
COVID -[ADDRESS_220194]  Version 2.3  
 24 April 2020  
15 Participants will be provided masked study medicine, shipped by [CONTACT_30367] (e.g. 
FedEx). The intervention vs. placebo will not be identical; however, participants 
and outcome assessors will be mask ed to their assignment.  
5.3.2 Reasons for Withdrawal  
 Participants may withdraw at any time point at their discretion.   
5.3.3 Handling of Withdrawals 
Withdraws will be counted as failures for the secondary endpoint of completion of 
study medication.  
Participants who discontinue study medication will still be asked to complete the 
follow up visit schedule.  
5.3.4 Termination of Study  
This study may be prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause, including but not limited to: 
● Unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects  
● Interim analyses by [CONTACT_4318].  
● Insufficient compliance with protocol requirements  
● Data are not sufficiently complete and/or not evaluable 
● Regulatory authorities decide that study should be terminated 
If the study is prematurely terminated for harm, current subjects will complete follow up, and no further subjects will be enrolled.  If the study is terminated due to benefit, then 
the study will immediately convert into an  open-label prospective cohort to collect further 
observational data on the safety and efficacy of the intervention, up to the IRB approved 
recruitment limit.

16 6 STUDY INTERVENTION /INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
6.[ADDRESS_220196] Description  
6.1.1 Acquisition 
  FDA-approved formulation of hydroxychloroquine will be purchased.  
6.1.2 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling 
The study medicines will be packaged by [CONTACT_186331].  Dispensed medications will be delivered by [CONTACT_30367] (e.g. Fedex) to study participants.  
Labels will include: “Caution: New Drug –  Limit ed by [CONTACT_186332].  Keep out of reach of children.”  
6.1.3 Drug Description:  
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate   
6.1.4 Formulation: 200mg tablet ( = 155 mg base of chloroquine)  
6.1.5 Pharmacokinetics:  
● Absorption: Rapid and almost completely  
● Distribution: Widely distributed into body tissues  
● Metabolism: Partially hepatic to main metabolyte of desethylchloroquine  
● Excretion: Urine (>=50% as unchanged drug); acidification of urine 
increases elimination 
● C
max = 1.2 nmol/mL = 1.2 µmol/L = 1.2 µ M  at 400mg single dos e.[15]  
● Tmax = 2.4 hours  
● T1/2 = 172 +  39 hours  = 7.1 +1.6 days  
● AUC last = 75.4 +  47 nmol/h/mL  
● This C max is in the therapeutic windo w for SARS- COV2 activity.  
● Steady state doses for 400mg dose is 974 µ g/L = 2.24 µM [16], thus a 
600mg dose should generate approximately 3 .4 µM , which is above the 
EC50 of viral inhibition of 1.3 µ M (EC50 = 50% inhibition; however, the 
more inhibition the better, likely).  
 
Population PK parameter modeling: [ADDRESS_220197]. Mahmoud Al -Kofahi of College of Pharmacy, Univ. of Minnesota  
 
The EC50 has been reported as 0.72 µM [5], although this is not a precise 
measurement, and should be view with a range of error present (but not reported). The 
EC50 is the point of 50% maximal inhibition, so more drug would be better (balanced 
against toxicity and drug supply). The percentage of persons achieving a 24 hour level 
above the EC50 is as follows ( Figure).

9.3 Reporting Procedures  
9.3.1 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
COVID -[ADDRESS_220208]  Version 2.3  
 24 April 2020  
24 ● Death 
● Life-threatening adverse event (as below)  
● Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
● Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or  
● Congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
● Important medical events that may not result in death, but are life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12190], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment they may jeopardize the patient or subjec t and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.   
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
 Life-threatening adverse events:  An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of 
either the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10157] , its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. For life threatening AEs, subjects would be recommended /expected to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
 
Based on the known safety track record of hydroxychloroquine, this pragmatic protocol will focus on death, life-threatening AEs, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  Incapacity / permanent 
disability is a possibility with COVID19, but this is not associated with 
hydroxychloroquine. In the event of incapacity, the subject would be expected to be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].   
 
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not known to cause teratogenic events and are viewed as safe in pregnancy, especially with short term use.  With this trial’s sample 
size, this will not further delineate this risk.  COVID19 disease may indeed be 
teratogenic. For women who are pregnant, we will ask to follow them through the end of 
their pregnancy , and they will be sent a follow up eCRF at [ADDRESS_220209]  Version 2.3  
 24 April 2020  
25 Serious unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) which are not expected 
with COVID- 19 nor listed in the FDA package insert will be reported to the IRB.  
Those S[LOCATION_003]RS whic h are deemed by [CONTACT_186336]. 
 
9.3.3 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not known to be teratogenic. Chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine can accumulate in neonatal eyes.  Conversely, the risk of severe 
COVID -19 infection is unknown, but likely is a heightened risk in pregnant women. The 
CDC states, “We do not have information on adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant 
women with COVID -19. Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth, has been 
observed in cases of infection with other related coronaviruses (SARS -CoV and MERS -
CoV) during pregnancy. High fevers during the first trimester of pregnancy can increase 
the risk of certain birth defects.”   
Thus, the risk/benefit would favor the enrollment of women who may be or are pregnant, so as to not discriminate against pregnant women. 
For women who are pregnant, we will ask to have follow through the end of their 
pregnancy  to assess outcome of the pregnancy via a brief survey .  
9.[ADDRESS_220210] up to 90 day follow up 
conducted to assess their final outcome.  Management will be as per  the participant’s 
local healthcare provider. 
9.5 Safety Oversight (DSMB) 
A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will oversee the trial.  The quorum will 
include three members and a biostatistician.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1317] a non-voting observer, providing input as requested.  See the DSMB charter for more details.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
COVID -[ADDRESS_220211] of the trial is in compliance with 
the currently approved protocol/ amendment(s), ICH, GCP, and with applicable 
regulatory requirement(s) and Sponsor requirements. Clinical monitoring will also verify 
that any critical study procedures are completed following specific instructions. 
Monitoring will be the responsibility of the University of Minnesota.  
 
The automated logic of the REDCap database system will enable complete records. All 
data are by [CONTACT_186337] t.

27 11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Study Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine is superior to placebo for preventing progression to 
COVID -19 disease among those who are asymptomatic . 
We hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine is superior to placebo for preventing progression 
among those with symptomatic mild COVID19 disease preventing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/death.  
11.2 Sample Size Considerations 
Two cohorts  of 1500 subjects each:   
1) Asymptomatic persons exposed to COV ID-19 disease (750 in placebo, 750 in intervention) ;  
2) Symptomatic outpatient COVID -19 disease (750 in placebo, 750 in intervention). 
 
Assumi ng 90% power, a two-sided alpha = 0.05 and loss to follow -up up to 20%, for each 
cohort the planned sample size i s 750 participants per arm based on the following assumptions:   
• 10% transmission rate from COVID -19 cases to close contacts  
• For those with symptomatic illness the proportions at day 14 in the placebo group are 90%, 8% and 2%, respectively for illness without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186312], and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186313].  
 
 
The estimated transmission rates are uncertain.  Table 1 below (for the asymptomatic cohort 
with exposure) shows that we are well powered to detect even a smaller (40%) relative 
reduction in the incidence of COVID 19 with 80% power for transmission rates of at least 10% 
with placebo.  Table 2 (for the symptomatic group) shows that we are well powered to detect a 
common odds ratio of 0.6-0.75 under the assumption that the control proportions for illness 
without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186314] 90%, 8% and 2%, respectively.

11.3 Planned Interim Analyses  
A Lan-DeMets spending function analog of the O’Brien-Fleming boundaries will be provided at 
each D SMB  report for the primary outcome for each cohort  The O’Brien-Fleming boundaries 
will be truncated at alpha = 0.001 (|Z| > 3.09).   For each cohort, interim analyses are separately 
planned at 25%, 50% and 75% of trial enrollment.   
 
As enrollment may be brisk , the timing of interim analys es may be altered at PI [INVESTIGATOR_186316].  It may be possible that the trial is fully enrolled by [CONTACT_186338] [ADDRESS_220214] 25% enrolled. In this case , any further analyses would be 
related as to when to release interim results.   
COVID -[ADDRESS_220215] D SMB review, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186317]. The purpose of this 
early review will assess the trends for safety/efficacy and allow for the D SMB  to determine the 
probable timing of further reviews  based on the pace of enrollment.  
Should a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186318], we would recommend an analysis to determine 
whether the findings are consistent across secondary endpoints, such that a clear answer is 
achieved. Starting with the 2nd DSMB review (at approximately 50% enrollment) the DSMB will 
be given the conditional power for both cohorts under both the study design parameters and the 
current data.   If the conditional power is less than 20% then trial discontinuation may be 
consider ed.   
In the event of early halting due to efficacy  of the intervention, the study will immediately 
convert to an open label observational cohort of hydroxychloroquine prescribed to all 
consented participants in the relevant cohort .  
In the event of early halting due to futility of no effect, a protocol modification will be 
made to alter the intervention.  
Based on the public health situation, the DSMB has the prerogative to alter the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
Sample Size Re-estimation:  
At time of ~50% enrollment, a sample size re-estimation should occur based on the disease 
transmission rate in the control group.  The a priori assumption (based on limited data) is 10% 
transmission risk.  The new sample size estimation will take into account the updated 
transmission rate with no treatment and will be powered to detect a 50% relative reduction in 
outcome.   
 
11.4 Final Analysis Plan  
 
Primary outcome analyses (intention to treat): 
 
Asymptomatic Cohort Primary Analysis : 
Those with asymptomatic exposure:  Incidence of COVID 19 disease by [CONTACT_4475] 14 will be 
assessed via Fisher’s Exact Test. 
 
Symptomatic Cohort Primary Analysis : 
Those with symptomatic disease at study entry:  For a summary metric of the change in 
symptom severity  over [ADDRESS_220216]  Version 2.3  
 24 April 2020  
30 Participants who become symptomatic with COVID19 on Day 1 befor e receiving the 
study medicine will be described with the symptomatic cohort. 
Secondary Analyses : 
For the asymptomatic with exposure cohort, the primary analysis (intention to treat) will 
be repeated for participants who received at least one dose of the s tudy medicine.  
● Secondary endpoints will be assessed via Fisher’s Exact test and median (with interquartile ranges) as appropriate.   
● Those with symptomatic disease at study entry:  Proportional odds models will be used 
to assess the ordinal scale for disease severity at day 14 (illness without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],   
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186319], or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186312]).  
● Severity of overall symptoms at Day 0, 1, 5, and [ADDRESS_220217] as a categorical analysis 
(no symptoms vs. symptoms) via Fisher’s Exact Chi Square.   
○ Second among those with symptoms, the 0-[ADDRESS_220218].  If data are non-normally 
distributed, then data will be compared via Mann- Whitney U by [CONTACT_30157].   
A priori subgroup analyses will include assessment by: 
● Confirmed SARS -CoV -2 disease or disease exposure 
● Healthcare worker vs. Household contact  
● Days from  Exposure 
● Decile of age 
● Sex as a biological variable 
● Censored subjects, who became symptomatic before receipt of the first dose of study 
medicine on D#1, will be separately analyzed and reported.  
 
Handling of withdrawn subjects. 
If there is a large lost to follow up / study discontinue rate, then the primary endpoint for the 
asymptomatic cohort would have a secondary analysis to assess incidence as a 3-category 
analysis of: i) no disease, ii) incident disease,  or iii) unknown.   
 
Similarly, the symptomatic cohort would add a fourth category of unknown.  
 
Participants who stop taking the study medicine but who agree to be followed for 14 days will be 
assessed as intent-to-treat. On Day 14, we will ask for other medications or vitamins that were taken during the study period.
 
 
Screened Persons  
Persons who are screened but not enrolled will be summarized in CONSORT diagrams and 
other descriptive summaries of their COVID -19 related information –  with all data de -identified.

* Incidence of COVID19 disease, defined on March 17 and thereafter as: “The primary analysis 
will use PCR+ confirmed disease.  However if the absence of sufficient testing supplies continues then outpatients will not be offered SARS-CoV-2 testing unless they are sick enough 
to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  In that case an alternate a priori planned analysis will define incident 
COVID19 disease as a composite of SARS-CoV- 2 PCR+ confirmed result OR symptomatic 
disease (i.e. possible) COVID-19 in those without testing.”   
 
I. Prophylaxis study primary outcome

II. Secondary outcomes  
a. Secondary outcomes for incidence will be presented as proportions and 
compared between the treatment groups  with Fisher’s Exact tests. 
b. Symptom severity scores were recorded with the online participant surveys at 
days 3, 5, 10 and 14 only for those w ho responded “yes” to “Any symptoms 
experienced”.   
i. Visual analog scale (0-10) for “overall symptom severity” is collected via a 
digital slider bar, which is marked with “0 = no symptoms”; 5 (placed in 
the middle); and “10 = severe symptoms” 
 
ii. For those who responded “no” to “Any symptoms experienced” the 
symptom severity score for that visit is assigned as zero. 
iii. For those hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186322], their symptom severity was scored 
as 10 if they did not respond to the visit survey.   
iv. Analysis is by [CONTACT_186345] 
14. 
 
 
Clarifications (24 May 2020): 
 Participants with missing outcome data are still included in the denominator, as the trial 
is performed as an intent to treat analysis. 
 Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding participants with missing data from the 
denominator as well as including participants with missing data as events.

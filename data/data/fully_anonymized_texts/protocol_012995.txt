2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Objective  
 
1. Determine  the effects  of fractionated  vs. bulk stem  cell infusions  on neutrophil  
recovery  as defined  by [CONTACT_553318] 500 neutrophils  per micro  liter and time to an absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC)  
of 500. 
 
Secondary  Objective  
1. Determine  the safety  of fractionated  vs bulk stem  cell infusions  in allo SCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
2. Determine  the effect  of fractionated  vs bulk stem  cell infusions  on other  parameters  
of immune - reconstitution.  (ALC  Day [ADDRESS_727086] transplant.  
 
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation  has become  a well established  curative  approach  for 
a variety  of malignant  and non malignant  hematologic  disorders.  (1) Transplant  related  
mortality  has been  reduced  significantly  over the last decade  due to improvements  in 
supportive  care and HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  (2)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_553298]  10-15% at [ADDRESS_727087] of those  deaths  are  
due to infectious  complications.  (3) Thus  enhancing  immune  reconstitution  post 
allogeneic  transplantation  could  theoretically  improve  transplant  outcomes  by [CONTACT_553319].  (4,5) Current  strategies  being  explored  include  the 
use of cytokines  (such  as IL-7), improvements  of thymic  function  using  androgen  
ablation,  or addition  of cytotoxic  T lymphocytes  targeting  specific  viral, bacterial  or fungal  
antigens.(4)   However,  most  of these  strategies  have yet to find wide application  due to 
costs  or logistic  reasons.  Two other  potential  strategies  to enhance  immune  
reconstitution  post allogeneic  transplant  could  be increasing  CD34  cell dose  or giving  
fractionated  stem  cell infusions.  Historically  stem  cell dose  as measured  by [CONTACT_553320]  a well established  prognostic  factor  for transplant  outcome  
(6,7).  The hypothesis  underlying  this observation  was that a higher  total nucleated  cell 
dose  was associated  with higher  stem  cell doses  that would  promote  a more  rapid  
hematologic  and immune  recovery.  However,  due to logistic  considerations  it will be 
difficult  to explore  modulating  stem  cell dose  after marrow  transplantation  outside  of the 
context  of unrelated  donor  transplants  for small  children  although  multiple  retrospective  
analysis  suggest  that higher  CD34+  cell doses  are associated  with improved  outcomes  
(8-19). W ith the advent  of filgrastim  mobilized  peripheral  blood  stem  cell transplantation  
(PBSCT)  and the use of CD34  enumeration  as a surrogate  for hematopoietic  stem cell 
numbers  the potential  role of stem  cell dose  (as measured  by [CONTACT_398]34+  cells on transplant  
outcomes)  can be explored.  However,  as of today  no prospective  trials looking  at CD34+  
cell dose  as a variable  has actually  been  performed.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_727088] stem  cell 
transplantation  could  be fractionation  of the stem  cell dose.(20 -22) Donor  stem  cell 
engraftment  after hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  is a complex  biological  
procedure.  After the stem  cells are infused  (usually  through  a central  venous  catheter,  a 
significant  number  of stem  cells are sequestered  within  the lungs  where  it is believed  
that they slowly  are released  into the circulation.  Through  a complex  network  of  
adhesion  molecules  and their ligands,  these  stem  cells migrate  and eventually  deposit  in 
appropriate  niches  for their growth  and proliferation.  The practice  of bulk stem  cell 
infusion  as currently  done  has been  adopted  because  of historical  and financial  reasons  
(easier  to infuse  all cells at once  rather  than separate  them  into aliquots  and infuse  in 
fractions).  However,  data is emerging  from animal  models  as well as better  
understanding  of stem  cell biology  and trafficking  suggest  that fractionating  the stem  cell 
infusion  may be beneficial,  because  it could  increase  the 
chance  of a hematopoietic  stem  cell to deposit  into a viable  hematopoietic  niche  to 
successfully  grow  and proliferate,  rather  than finding  itself sequestered  in a damaged  niche  
which  could  serve  as a “stem  cell sink”.  In a murine  sickle  cell disease  transplant  model  Felfly  
et al showed  that infusing  the same  number  of cells in two, three  or four equal  sub doses  
within  28 hours  of myelosuppression  the engraftment  efficiency  increased  to greater  than 85% 
compared  to the 40% obtained  following  one-cell dose  infusion.   Importantly,  full engraftment  
for all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_553299] 28 hours  for both irradiation  levels  (Table  1). (20) Other  
murine  models  have also suggested  a potential  improvement  in engraftment  when  stem  cells 
are given  in fractions  over a period  of time rather  than in bulk. (21,22)  
 
Table  1: Effect  of Fractionating  Stem  Cell Infusions  on Engraftment  (20 Felfly  et al,) 
 
 
 
 
 
In the autologous  setting  multiple  infusions  of stem  cells have been  performed  but at relatively  low 
CD34  doses  with no definitive  impact  on outcome  but no toxicities  either,  however,  the doses  
explored  were  relatively  low (Less  than 5 x 10e6  CD34+  cells/kg)  (23,24).  This proposed  trial will 
be the first attempt  to demonstrate  the safety  and immune  reconstitution  effects  of 
fractionated  stem  cell infusions  in patients  undergoing  allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation.

The primary  endpoint  of this trial is neutrophil  reconstitution,  we hypothesize  that fractionated  stem  
cell infusion  will reduce  the period  of absolute  neutropenia  less than 500 cells per microliter  by 30% 
(7 days for a TCD graft and 9 days for a unmanipulated  graft).  Fractionated  stem  cell infusions  could  
enhance  neutrophil  recovery  through  recruitment  of committed  progenitor  cells during  the 
subsequent  stem  cell infusion  and through  reduction  of the number  of stem  cells that migrate  to 
“ineffective  niches”.  
Secondary  endpoints  are immune -reconstitution  as defined  by [CONTACT_553321] D30 and D15 primarily.  This 
endpoint  was derived  from a  recent  analysis  performed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Goldberg  in our institution,  a 
retrospective  study  of 353 consecutive  patients  (median  age 39, range  2-68) who received  a fully 
TCD allo HSCT.  The median  absolute  lymphocyte  count  at day [ADDRESS_727089] transplant  was 500 
and 800 per microliter  respectively  and was associated  with improved  survival  on univariate  
analysis.  On multivariate  analysis  ALC on day 30 and NK cell count  on day 60 were  also associated  
with improved  survival.  (25) 
Other  secondary  endpoints  include  incidence  of acute  GVHD.  With current  CD34  selection  
technology  the incidence  of Grade  2 or greater  GVHD  is 10-15% for TCD SCT and 40% for 
unmanipulated  stem  cells.(26 -29) We hypothesize  that fractionating  the stem  cell infusion  will not 
increase  the risk of Grade  2 or greater  GVHD  to over 25% with less than 10% of patients  getting  
Grade  3 or 4 GVHD  if they received  a TCD transplant  and less than 20% if they received  an 
unmanipulated  SCT.  (26,28)  Historical  graft failure  rates  of between  2-5% have  been  reported  with T 
Cell depletion  transplants  and less than 2% with an unmanipulated  graft.  We expect  that this rate will 
not increase  with fractionated  stem  cell infusions.  
This trial includes  a heterogeneous  group  of patients,  however,  since  our primary  endpoint  is 
neutrophil  recovery  which  is not impacted  by [CONTACT_637],  disease  stage,  or conditioning  regimen,  in 
this initial  trial the patient  heterogeneity  should  not affect  the analysis  of the primary  outcome.  The 
Stem  Cell Transplant  Trialist  Group  recently  performed  a meta -analysis  on [ADDRESS_727090] of these  
trials allowed  for multiple  diagnosis  and multiple  conditioning  regimens.  In both individual  reports  as 
well as the meta -analysis  only stem  cell source  (peripheral  blood  versus  bone  marrow)  impacted  
engraftment  kinetics.  
 
Additionally,  Pulsipher  et al reported  on 932 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_553300]  (URD -PBSC  HCT)  for acute  myeloid  leukemia,  acute  
lymphoblastic  leukemia,  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia,  and myelodysplastic  syndrome  enrolled  on 
a prospective  National  Marrow  Donor  Program  trial from 1999  through  2003.  Preparative  regimens  
included  myeloablative  (MA; N = 611),  reduced -intensity  (RI; N = 160),  and nonmyeloablative  (NMA;  
N = 161).  For MA recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  CD34+ counts  greater  than 3.8 × 106/kg improved  neutrophil  and 
platelet  engraftment,  whereas  improved  overall  survival  (OS)  and reduced  transplant -related  
mortality  (TRM)  were  seen  for all preparative  regimens  when  CD34+ cell doses  exceeded  4.5 × 
106/kg. Higher  infused  doses  of CD34+ cell dose  did not result  in increased  rates  of either  acute  or 
chronic  graft-versus -host disease  (GVHD).  Thus,  demonstrating  that at least  for neutrophil  recovery  
patient  and disease  characteristics  did not impact  engraftment  kinetics.

5.1.4  Busulfan  (busulfex ®) 
Source  and Pharmacology:  Supplier:  Otsuka  Pharmaceuticals;  Busulfan  is a bifunctional  alkylating  
agent  known  chemically  as 1,4-butanediol,  dimethanesulfonate.  BUSULFEX®  (busulfan).  This is an 
agent  in which  two labile  methanesulfonate  groups  are attached  to opposite  ends of a four carbon  
alkyl chain.  In aqueous  media,  busulfan  hydrolyzes  to release  the methanesulfonate  groups.  This 
produces  reactive  carbonium  ions that can alkylate  DNA.  DNA  damage  is thought  to be responsible  
for much  of the cytotoxicity  of busulfan.  
Formulation  and Stability:  It is supplied  as a clear,  colorless,  sterile,  solution  in 10 mL single  use 
ampoules.  Each  ampoule  of BUSULFEX  contains  60 mg (6 mg/mL)  of busulfan,  the active  
ingredient,  a white  crystalline  powder  with a molecular  formula  of CH 3SO 2O(CH 2)4OSO 2CH 3 and a 
molecular  weight  of 246 g/mole.  Busulfan  is dissolved  in N,N-dimethylacetamide  (DMA)  33% wt/wt  
and polyethylene  glycol  400, 67% wt/wt.  Busulfans  solubility  in water  is 0.1 g/L and the pH of a 
>0.5%  solution  in 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection,  USP or 5% Dextrose  Injection,  USP as 
recommended  for infusion  reflects  the pH of the diluent  used  and ranges  from 3.4 to 3.9. 
Solution  Preparation:  BUSULFEX  is supplied  as a sterile  solution  in 10 mL single -use clear  glass  
ampoules  each  containing  60 mg of busulfan  at a concentration  of 6 mg/mL  for intravenous  use. 
BUSULFEX  must  be diluted  prior to use with either  0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection,  USP (normal  
saline)  or 5% Dextrose  Injection,  USP (D5W).  The diluent  quantity  should  be 10 times  the volume  of 
BUSULFEX,  ensuring  that the final concentration  of busulfan  is approximately  0.5 mg/mL.  
Storage  and Stability:  Unopened  ampules  of BUSULFEX  must  be stored  under  refrigerated  
conditions  between  2° -8° C (36° -46° F).

approximately  5 mg/mL  of Thymoglobulin,  of which  >90%  is rabbit  gamma  immune  globulin  (IgG).  
The reconstituted  solution  has a pH of 7.0± 0.4. Human  red blood  cells are used  in the 
manufacturing  process  to deplete  cross -reactive  antibodies  to non-T-cell antigens.  The 
manufacturing  process  is validated  to remove  or inactivate  potential  exogenous  viruses.  All human  
red blood  cells are from US registered  or FDA licensed  blood  banks.  A viral inactivation  step 
(pasteurization,  i.e., heat treatment  of active  ingredient  at 60°C/10  hr) is performed  for each  lot. 
Each  Thymoglobulin  lot is released  following  potency  testing  (lymphocytotoxicity  and E-rosette  
inhibition  assays),  and cross -reactive  antibody  testing  (hemagglutination,  platelet  agglutination,  anti- 
human  serum  protein  antibody,  antiglomerular  basement  membrane  antibody,  and fibroblast  toxicity  
assays  on every  5th lot).

Approval date: [ADDRESS_727104]  Prevention  are the Following:  
 
5.2.1  Tacrolimus  
Source  and Pharmacology:  Prograf  (Astellas  Pharmaceuticals)  Absorption  of tacrolimus  from the 
gastrointestinal  tract after oral administration  is incomplete  and variable.  The absolute  bioavailability  
of tacrolimus  was 17 ± 10% in adult  kidney  transplant  patients  (N=26),  22 ± 6% in adult  liver 
transplant  patients  (N=17),  and 18 ± 5% in healthy  volunteers  (N=16).  The plasma  protein  binding  of 
tacrolimus  is approximately  99% and is independent  of concentration  over a range  of 5-50 ng/mL.  
Tacrolimus  is bound  mainly  to albumin  and alpha -1-acid glycoprotein,  and has a high level of 
association  with erythrocytes.  The distribution  of tacrolimus  between  whole  blood  and plasma  
depends  on several  factors,  such  as hematocrit,  temperature  at the time of plasma  separation,  drug 
concentration,  and plasma  protein  concentration.  
Formulation  and Stability:  Tacrolimus  injection  must  be diluted  with 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Injection  
or 5% Dextrose  Injection  to a concentration  between  0.004  mg/mL  and 0.02 mg/mL  prior to use. 
Diluted infusion solution should be stored in glass or polyethylene containers and should be 
discarded  after 24 hours.  The diluted  infusion  solution  should  not be stored  in a PVC container  due 
to decreased  stability  and the potential  for extraction  of phthalates.  In situations  where  more  dilute  
solutions  are utilized  (e.g.,  pediatric  dosing,  etc.),  PVC-free tubing  should  likewise  be used  to 
minimize  the potential  for significant  drug adsorption  onto the tubing.  Parenteral  drug products  
should  be inspected  visually  for particulate  matter  and discoloration  prior to administration,   
whenever  solution  and container  permit.  Due to the chemical  instability  of tacrolimus  in alkaline  
media,  Prograf  injection  should  not be mixed  or co-infused  with solutions  of pH 9 or greater  (e.g.,  
ganciclovir  or acyclovir).  Supplied  as a sterile  solution  in 1-mL ampoules  containing  the equivalent  of 
5 mg of anhydrous  tacrolimus  per mL, in boxes  of 10 ampoules.  Store  between  5°C and 25°C  (41°F  
and 77°F).   Prograf  capsules  (1 and 5 mg) are stored  at controlled  room  temperature,  15°C -30°C  
(59°F -86°F).

Patients  should  be under  close  observation  for possible  allergic  manifestations  including  facial  
flushing,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645],  with dyspnea  and wheezing,  blood  pressure  changes  and tachycardia.  
Prior to infusion  solution  should  be inspected  visually  for particulate  matter  and discoloration.  
Other  nephrotoxic  agents  will increase  the risk of nephrotoxicity  (amphotericin  B, aminoglycosides,  
and acyclovir).  
Plasma  concentrations  of cyclosporine  may be affected  by [CONTACT_362636]:  
Increased  cyclosporine  levels:  ketoconazole,  erythromycin,  cimetidine,  calcium  channel  blockers,  
fluconazole,  itraconazole,  norfloxacin,  imipenem / cisplatin.  
Decreased  cyclosporine  levels:  rifampin,  phenytoin,  phenobarbital,  imipenem/  cisplatin.  
The IV to oral dose  conversion  is 1:3. The target  serum  level of 200- 400 is desirable;  800 is 
considered  toxic.  
Renal  and hepatic  parameters  should  be monitored  routinely  with dosage  adjustments  in the case  of 
serum  creatinine  or LFT elevations.  
Incompatibilities:  Do not co-administer  with any drug.

5.2.4  The CliniMACS System for Positive Selection of CD34+ Progenitor Cells and Depletion 
of T-Cells  
 
The CliniMACS  System  (Miltenyi  Biotec,  Auburn,  CA) including  the CliniMACS plus Instrument,  a 
CliniMACS  Tubing  Set, the CliniMACS  CD34  Reagent  and the CliniMACS  PBS/EDTA  Buffer  is 
intended  for the selection  and enrichment  of human  CD34  positive  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells 
from a leukapheresis  product.  The CD34  antigen  is a cell membrane  glycoprotein  expressed  by  
[CONTACT_553327].  The CD34  positive  cell separation  process  may be 
useful  in several  areas  of clinical  stem  cell transplantation,  including  purging  of tumor  cells,  T-cell 
depletion,  ex vivo cell expansion  and gene  therapy.  When  re-infused  after myeloablative  
chemotherapy,  CD34  positive  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells have been  shown  to reconstitute  all 
hematologic  lineages  and exhibit  both short  and long term repopulating  capacities.  The ClinMACS  
System  uses selective  CD34  monoclonal  antibodies  conjugated  to superparamagnetic  particles.  The 
CD34  positive  target  cells are selected  in an automated  continuous  flow separation  system.  The 
CD34  positive  cells are specifically  labeled  for selection  by [CONTACT_553328]34  
Reagent.  After unbound  reagent  is washed  from the suspension,  the cells are ready  for the 
automated  separation  process.  The CliniMACS  System  passes  the antibody -labeled  suspension;  the 
cells are ready  for the automated  separation  process.  The CliniMACS  System  passes  the antibody - 
labeled  suspension  through  a column  in which  strong  magnetic  gradients  are generated.  The 
Selection  Column  retains  the magnetically  labeled  CD34  positive  cells,  while  unwanted  cells flow 
through  the Selection  Column  and are collected  in the Negative  Fraction  Bag. The system  performs  
several  washing  steps,  disposing  most  of the liquid  into the Buffer  Waste  Bag. The Separated  CD34  
positive  cells are released  from the column  by [CONTACT_553329]. 
 
The components  of the CliniMACS  System  include:

[IP_ADDRESS].  CliniM  ACS Tubing  Set 
 
The CliniMACS  Tubing  Set consists  of a tubing  element  combined  with a pair of proprietary  cell 
selection  columns.  These  form a closed,  sterile  system  for processing  the cells.  The separation  
column  is a proprietary  component  of the CliniMACS  System  consisting  of a plastic  column  housing  
with polypropylene  frits in each  end. The interior  of the column  housing  is filled with a matrix  of sub- 
millimeter  iron beads  coated  with a heat-cured  biocompatible  resin.  The columns  are placed  at 
appropriate  locations  in the CliniMACS  Tubing  Set to facilitate  the cell selection  process.  The first 
column  serves  as a device  to remove  components  that bind non-specifically  to the column.  The 
second  column  which  is placed  within  a magnetic  field performs  the actual  cell selection.  The 
columns  are incorporated  sterile  as part of the tubing  set and are intended  for single  use only. 
 
The tubing  element  consists  of a series  of tubes,  connectors,  spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988],  Luer locks,  and collection  
bags.  The tubing  of the tubing  element  is comprised  of materials  that have been  qualified  for use in 
this application  by [CONTACT_93101] [ZIP_CODE].  The principal  constituents  are polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  and 
silicone.  The connectors  are made  of various  polymers  (e.g.,  ABS and PVC)  suitable  for use in a 
blood  contact  [CONTACT_93102].  They  are solvent  bonded  to the PVC tubing.  The silicone  pump  tubing  is 
softened  with petroleum  ether  for manufacturing  and mechanically  fixed to connectors.  The cell 
wash  bags are composed  of PVC.  
 
The CliniMACS  Tubing  Set is packaged  in a thermoformed  tray and heat sealed  with a Tyvek®  lid.

GVHD  Prophylaxis  Regimen  
 
Only the following  GVHD  prophylaxis  regimens  are allowable  on this study.  
a) Calcineurin  inhibitor  (tacrolimus  or cyclosporine)  that is continued  for a minimum  of 6 months  
(therapeutic  blood  levels  for a minimum  of 4 months)  in addition  to mini dose  methotrexate  or 
sirolimus.  
b) Ex-vivo T-cell depletion  with CD 34 selection  using  the CliniMACS  device.  
Recommendations  for the administration  of the GVHD  agents  are listed  as follows:  
 
Tacrolimus  treatment  regimen  
Tacrolimus  is administered  beginning  at least one day before  transplantation  for a minimum  of six 
months.   The initial  dose  should  be based  on the ideal body  weight  of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Subsequent  
doses  are based  on blood  levels.  Determinations  of blood  levels  should  be performed  at least once  
weekly  for the initial  three  months.   Dose  reductions  should  be made  if toxicity  is present  or whole  
blood  levels  are above  the recommended  range,  in the absence  of toxicity.   Dose  reductions  for high 
levels  without  toxicity  should  be conservative,  e.g. 25%,  to avoid  inadequate  immunosuppression.  
 
The tacrolimus  regimen  for GVHD  prophylaxis  will initially  employ  an intravenous  total daily dose  of 
1.3 mg/kg/day.   Subsequent  tacrolimus  doses  are adjusted  to target  whole  blood  levels  between  5 
and 15 ng/mL.   When  a patient  is switched  from intravenous  to oral tacrolimus,  the dose  is increased  
by 3-[ADDRESS_727112]  tacrolimus  levels  are: 
1. Caspofungin,  phenobarbital,  phenytoin,  rifampin,  carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  rifabutin,  St. John ‟s Wort  
(lowers  levels);  
2. Glucocorticoids,    fluconazole,    voriconazole,    ketoconazole,    itraconazole,    grapefruit    juice,  
amprenavir,  bromocriptine,  chloramphenicol,  cimetidine,   cisapride,   clarithromycin,

quinupristin/dalfopristin,  ritonavir,  saquinavir,  theophylline,   troleandomycin,   verapamil  
(increases  levels).  For patients  who are taking  both tacrolimus.  
 
Per the tacrolimus  package  insert,  when  initiating  therapy  with voriconazole  in patients  already  
receiving  tacrolimus,  it is recommended  that the tacrolimus  dose  be reduced  to one-third of the 
original  dose  and followed  with frequent  monitoring  of the tacrolimus  blood  levels.   Increased  
tacrolimus  levels  have been  associated  with nephrotoxicity.   When  voriconazole  is discontinued,  
tacrolimus  levels  should  be carefully  monitored  and the dose  increased  as necessary.

≥ 6 yr:  0.03 mg/kg/24  hr 
 
Cyclosporine  treatment  regimen  
The cyclosporine  regimen  for GVHD  prophylaxis  will initially  employ  an intravenous  total daily dose  
of 3 mg/kg/day.  Subsequent  cyclosporine  doses  are adjusted  to target  whole  blood  levels  between  
150 and 450 nano  (n)g/mL.  
 
Oral formulations  of cyclosporine  have variable  bioavailability  (intestinal  absorption),  and Neoral  
appears  to have a higher  and more  predictable  bioavailability  than other  formulations.   When  a 
patient  is switched  from intravenous  cyclosporine  to Neoral  (preferred)  or other  oral formulation,  the 
dose  is increased  by 2.5-[ADDRESS_727113]  cyclosporine  levels:  
1. Caspofun gin, phenobarbital,  phenytoin,  rifampin,  carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  rifabutin,  St. John ‟s Wort

troleandomycin,  verapamil  (increases  levels ) 
3. Per the voriconazole  package  insert,  when  initiating  therapy  with voriconazole  in patients  
already  receiving  cyclosporine,  it is recommended  that the cyclosporine  dose  be reduced  to 
one-half of the original  dose  and followed  with frequent  monitoring  of the cyclosporine  blood  
levels.  Increased  cyclosporine  levels  have been  associated  with nephrotoxicity.  When  
voriconazole  is discontinued,  cyclosporine  levels  should  be frequently  monitored  and the 
dose  increased  as necessary.(i) 
Methotrexate  
The regimen  of methotrexate  for GVHD  prophylaxis  will employ  intravenous  doses  of [ADDRESS_727114]  space  syndromes  with large  accumulation  of ascites  or pleural  effusions  are a contraindication  
to the use of methotrexate.   Dose  reductions  should  be made  for renal,  hepatic  and mucosal  toxicity.  
Determinations  of blood  levels  are indicated  24-72 hours  after administration  in patients  with 
impaired  renal  function.   Leucovorin  rescue  should  be considered  in patients  with decreased  
clearance,  severe  toxicity  or fluid accumulation/effusions.  
 
Drugs  that may increase  methotrexate  levels  are: 
1. Non-steroidal  anti inflammatory  drugs  
2. Penicillins  
3. Diuretics  
 
Post transplant  supportive  care will follow  institutional  and BMT guidelines  
Tacrolimus/Sirolimus  and  mini-methotrexate  
Adults:  Sirolimus  will be given  in a loading  dose  of 12 mg orally on Day –[ADDRESS_727115]  vomits  within  15 minutes  of an oral 
dose.  
 
Children:  Children  weighing  < 40.0 kg will be given  an oral loading  dose  of sirolimus  of 3 mg/m2  
followed  by a daily oral dose  of 1 mg/m2,  rounded  to the nearest  full milligram.

Adults  and Children:  Tacrolimus  will be given  at a dose  of 0.02 mg/kg  every  24 hours  as a 
continuous  intravenous  infusion  beginning  on Day –3. Convert  the tacrolimus  to oral dosing  at 2-3 
times  the total 24-hour intravenous  dose,  split into 2 doses  given  every  12 hours  as soon  as 
clinically  feasible.  
 
Methotrexate  will be given  at a dose  of 5 mg/m2  intravenously  on days +1, +3, +6, and +11 to 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_553306].  The day +1 dose  should  not be administered  until 24 hours  
after the BM or PBSC  infusion.  All doses  of methotrexate  should  be administered  unless  life- 
threatening  complications  prevent  administration.  The BMT attending  will determine  if any MTX dose  
adjustments  are necessary.  IV folinic  acid is NOT given  after mini-methotrexate.  
Methotrexate  dose  adjustment  will be as follows:  
 
HOLD:  for Creatinine  that doubles  from admission  AND is >2.0 mg/dl  OR Creatinine  >3.0 mg/dl  
(regardless  of baseline  
 
HOLD:  for total Bilirubin  > 3.0 mg/dl  
MTX DOSE  ADJUSTMENTS  FOR  WEIGHT:  Use actual  body weight  for patients  with BSA < 2.5 m2, 
and adjusted  body weight  for BSA > 2.5 m2. 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
HSCT  evaluations  are summarized  in the following  table.  Scheduled  evaluations  for  D30 may be 
performed  +/-7 days,  for D60 and D90 may be done  on +/-7 days,  for 6 months  may be done  +/-14 
days,  and for 12 months  may be performed  +/-30 days of the targeted  date.  Evaluations  may be 
withheld  if the treating  physician  feels that there  is a strong  contra -indication  to perform  the study

approximate  dates  for tests  and procedures  performed  after transplant  for this protocol.  
10.2 Assessment of Immune-recovery 
For this study  immune -recovery  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_553332] 15 (+/- 24 
hrs), day 30, and time to lymphocyte  count  of 500. 
Quantitative  recovery  of T cell subpopulations  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_4133],  through  [ADDRESS_727117] stem  cell transplant:  (ref)83
 
Per BMT  SOC  
1) CD3+  T cells and 2 subsets  CD3+CD4+  and CD3+CD8+.  
2) CD16+56+  NK cells.  
3) CD19+  B cells.  
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Toxicities  will be graded  on a scale  of 0 to 4 as described  by [CONTACT_6812]-Common  Terminology  for 
Adverse  Events  (CTCAE),  version  4.0. 
Side effects common to all transplant procedures include: 
Likely  
• Nausea  and vomiting  
• Infusion  reactions  including  fever  and rash 
• Mouth  sores  
• Diarrhea

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Definition  of events  in the post-transplant  course  important  for analysis  and treatment:  
 
12.[ADDRESS_727118]  cytogenetic  studies  at about  1 month  and as stated  in Section  10.0 
Page  28 of 36 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -016 A(12)  
Approval date: 30 -Jan-2018   
  
 
 
 
12.2 Graft  failure  or rejection  
Primary  non-engraftment  is diagnosed  when  the patient  fails to achieve  an ANC 500/l at any time 
in the first [ADDRESS_727119]-transplant.  (30,31)  
 
Patients  who suffer  graft failure  will be considered  for a secondary  transplant.  The need  for  
additional  immunosuppression  or treatment  for viral infection  prior to the secondary  transplant  will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_120192].  
For patients  who are engrafted  with donor  cells but have severe  cytopenia  affecting  one or more  
blood  cell lineages,  secondary  transplants  of CliniMACS  fractionated  CD34+  T-cell depleted  PBSCs  
may be administered  to booster  and replenish  donor  hematopoietic  cells without  conditioning  or after 
treatment  with anti-thymocyte  globulin.  If at any time,  a patient  receives  a secondary  transplant  they 
will be taken  off study.  These  patients  will be followed  for survival.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_727120]  BMT-CTN and IBMTR  systems  clinical  criteria  as defined  by [CONTACT_93128],  et al will be 
used  to establish  and grade  acute  GvHD.(32)  
 
Patients  will be observed  for acute  and/or  chronic  GvHD  as long as they have not received  donor  
derived  leukocytes  infusions  (DLI)  for the treatment  of relapse  or infections.  If at any time,  a patient  
receives  DLI they will be taken  off study.  These  patients  will be followed  for survival.  
 
12.4 Regimen -related  and transplant -related  mortality  
 
Regimen  related  toxicity  (RRT)  refers  to those  toxicities  that can be attributed  directly  to 
the preparative  regimen  (including  radiation,  chemotherapeutic  agents  and ATG).  
 
Transplant -related  mortality  (TRM) includes  the RRT and other  fatal complications  
resulting  from the allogenic  transplant  such  as graft failure,  GvHD,  hemorrhages,  and 
infections.   The grading  for monitoring  transplant  related  toxicities  will be based  on the 
NCI/CTEP  common  toxicity  criteria  (57). This will include  assessment  of severity  and 
duration  of oral mucositis  and sequelae  specifically  parenteral  opi[INVESTIGATOR_120131], TPN 
use, febrile  neutropenia,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_553309].  
 
12.5 Infections  
The occurrence  of life-threatening  opportunistic  infections  will be evaluated  according  to the criteria  
established  by [CONTACT_180898] (see Appendix  1) and will correlate  this with the level of immune  recovery.  
The infection -related  mortality  will be also determined.  Patients  will be considered  to have  died from 
infection  if death  is attributed  to a recent  severe  infection  and/or  infection  was identified  at autopsy.  
Patients  with relapsed  disease  before  death  will be excluded  from the above  definition,  even  if an 
infection  was the final cause  of death.  
 
12.6 Disease  relapse  
Relapse  of MDS,  AML and AML will be defined  by [CONTACT_553333] 5%, by [CONTACT_93132],  or by [CONTACT_553334]. Cytogenetic  analysis  of the marrow  and/or  peripheral  blood  will also be obtained  
for the diagnosis  of relapse.  Other  disease  relapses  will be scored  by [CONTACT_2085],  laboratory  and 
pathologic  criteria.  
 
12.7 Disease -free Survival  
DFS is defined  as the minimum  time interval  of times  to relapse/recurrence,  to death  or to the last 
follow -up, from the time of transplant.

IRB Number: 12 -016 A(12)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_727121] follow -up. 
 
12.9 CD34 + and CD3 + Cell Doses  
Total  CD34 + and CD3 + cell doses  will be calculated  based  on results  of flow cytometric  
analysis.  
 
 
12.10  Immune  reconstitution  Parameters  
 
For this study  immune -recovery  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_553335] 15, 30 and 
time to lymphocyte  count  of 500 as noted  above  in Section  10.2.  
13.0     CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
If at any time the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the section  
on Criteria  for patient/subject  eligibility  (e.g. a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be 
removed  from the study.  Also patients  may be removed  from the study  if requested  by [CONTACT_4677].  Management  will depend  on where  they are in their treatment  course.  Such  patients  
will receive  appropriate  supportive  care.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_553310].  
 
 
14.0     BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This randomized  phase  2 study  is designed  to explore  the effects  of CD34+  dose on hematopoietic  
recovery  for patients  with myeloid  leukemias  undergoing  an allogeneic  stem  cell transplant.  The 
primary  endpoint  of the study  is the time to engraftment.  Patients  will be randomized  to one of two 
groups.  
Group  1: Patients  targeted  to receive  8 x 10e6  CD34+  cells per kg on the day of the transplant.  
Group  2: Patients  targeted  to receive  4 x 10e6  CD34+  cells per kg on the day of the transplant  and 
then receive  three  supplemental  infusions  on days 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_727122].  The three  supplemental  
infusions  will contain  a total of 4 x 10e6  CD34+  cells per kg. In addition,  patients  will be stratified  by 
[CONTACT_553317]  (T cell depletion  vs no T cell depletion).  
Each  treatment  group  will accrue  [ADDRESS_727123] statistic  (van Elteren  test) will be used  for 
this comparison.  The test will be stratified  by [CONTACT_553336]  (T cell depletion  vs no T 
cell depletion).  
A power  function  for the rank sum test is computed  from the Lehmann  family  of alternative  
hypotheses,  using  a single  parameter,  the ratio of the expected  time to engraftment  for patients  
receiving  the single  cell dose  (group  1) relative  to the expected  time to engraftment  for patients  
receiving  multiple  cell doses  (group  2). It is projected  that the expected  time to engraftment  is [ADDRESS_727124] has power  equal  to 0.80 based  on these  projections  (Heller  2006).  The 
choice  of a 0.20 significance  level is intended  to reduce  the sample  size required  for this two group  
comparative  study.  A significant  outcome  does not imply  definitive  evidence  of superiority  for one 
treatment  group  due to this high type 1 error,  but instead  provides  sufficient  evidence  that testing  of 
this treatment  should  proceed  to a larger  multicenter  comparative  study  (Korn  et al, 2005).

• The area under  the hematopoietic  recovery   curve  for the factors:  ALC,   CD4,  CD8,   and 
platelet  count.  The area under  the curve  will be computed  based  on recordings  at days 30, 
60, 100, 180, 365. 
• The time to ALC 500, and the time to first bacterial,  viral, and fungal   infection   will  be 
computed  using  the cumulative  incidence  function  and a comparison  between  groups  will be 
undertaken  using  Gray ‟s test.

15.3 Randomization  
 
After eligibility  is established  and immediately  after consent  is obtained,  patients  will be registered  in 
the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  system  and randomized  using  the Clinical  Research  
Database  (CRDB)  by [CONTACT_553337] [PHONE_214]  between  the hours  of 8:30 am 
and 5:30 pm, Monday  - Friday.  Randomization  will be accomplished  by [CONTACT_553338]  (T cell depletion  vs no T cell 
depletion).  
At the time of registration,  patients  will be randomized  to either  receive  all cells in bulk on day 0 
(GROUP  1) or receive  4 x 10e6  CD34+  cells/kg  on day [ADDRESS_727128] of the cells being  infused  on 
days 2, 4, 6 in equally  distributed  aliquots  (GROUP  2). At least 7 x 10e6  cells/kg  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_553313] T cell depleted  transplants  and non T cell depleted   
transplants  randomized  on to the fractionated  arm. Patients  randomized  into the fractionated  arm will 
be advised  that if the donor  fails to collect  the appropriate  number  of cells they will not be randomized  
but continued  to be treated  on protocol  and receive  all their cells as a bulk infusion.  
 
Those  patients  who were  randomized  into the fractionated  or bulk arm and failed  to collect  
the appropriate  number  of cells will be replaced  until both arms  have reached  the target  
accrual. 
 
16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study  and will be responsible  for 
both pediatric  and adult  accruals.  The responsibilities  of the RSA and the principal  
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_553314],  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  
regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  activities  of the 
protocol  study  team. 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into the Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB),  
a secure  database.  Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  
patient  record.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  
of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will 
be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  
to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_209870],  at a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:

Approval date: [ADDRESS_727129]  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus 
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.   The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for Phase  III 
clinical  trials, report  to the Cente r‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
Page  33 of 36 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 12 -016 A(12)  
Approval date: 30 -Jan-2018   
  
 
 
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
• 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is required  for 30- 
days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any events  that occur  after 
the 30-day period  and that are at least  possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  
Events ‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  The IRB 
requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  electronically  to the SAE 
Office  as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] . 
All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] .

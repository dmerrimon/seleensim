of those studies demonstrate non -inferiority; are pragmatic (prescribe the analgesics as used in practice); follow a 
patient through the entire pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]; determine tablets remaining  in the patient’s household; and compare the 
patient’s propensity fo r obtaining future opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155].   This pi[INVESTIGATOR_731464] a pragmatic clinical 
trial which could demonstrate that a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen is at least as good as the most 
commonly prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_731465] -surgical pain.   
 
1.[ADDRESS_999186] procedures and instruments that will be used in a large scale, 
multi -site clinical study.  The research design and methods will be identic al for subjects enrolled in each of the 
phases.  
• Phase 1: Enrolling 24 subjects  (12 male and 12 female)  at Rutgers School of Dental Medicine Oral Surgery 
Clinic  
• Phase 2: Enrolling 8 (4 male and 4 female) subjects at each of the additional clinical sites  
o University of [COMPANY_002]ster  
o University of Maryland  
o University of Illinois  
o University of Michigan  
Phase [ADDRESS_999187] 10 participants in Phase 1 ( at RSDM) have completed Visit 2.  
 
Subje cts, who have presented to the Dental  Clinic to have at least one impacted lower 3rd molar extracted, will be 
followed at surgery then for 9 ( -/+5) days post -surgery in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  As this is a pragmatic clinical trial, subjects 
are able to determin e when and how much of the study analgesic to use.  Subject compliance is  based upon 
completion of the e Diary morning and evening entries and at the post -operative visit.   
Subjects will complete a questionnaire prior to surgery related to their pre -operat ive pain.  
 
Immediately following surgery, subjects will be given a study material package which  contains the following items:   
• Pain Medication  in SMRxT bottles : Two combination analgesics will be used and subjects will be randomly 
assigned to either the OPI[INVESTIGATOR_136461] (Hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 300 mg) or NON -OPI[INVESTIGATOR_731456] 
(ibuprofen 400 mg/acetaminophen 500mg).  Study analgesics will be formulated from powder by [CONTACT_731507] 2 different size/color capsules.

will be contained in 2 SMRxT bottles, electronic bottles which enable the tracking of capsule removal at any 
given time.   
• Actigrap h- sleep/ activity monitor worn like a watch  that tracks and transmits daily activity data  
 
 In addition to managing their post -operative pain as needed, s ubjects will be asked  to actively participate over the 
post -operative period  (time between surgery visit and post -operative visit). S ubjects  will be asked to complete a pain 
eDiary twice a day during the post -operative period and wear an Actigraph activity/sleep monitor continuously for 
the first [ADDRESS_999189] -operative period.

B. Recruitment Details  
The Clinical Co -Investigators will have identified patients presenting for impacted 3rd molar  extraction.  A 
Clinical Co -Investigator will approach the patient and determine if he/she is interested in finding out about 
a clinical trial about pain medications.  After asking if the patient is interested in participating in the trial 
comparing the ef fectiveness of two pain medications, an explanation will be provided along with the 
consent form.  The patient will be provided [ADDRESS_999215] which would 
exclude them from the study.  If during the eligibility  process an exclusion is found, the patient will be 
deemed ineligible to partic ipate.  
▪ Inclusion Criteria  
Adult men and non -pregnant women who are at least [ADDRESS_999216] 
be in generally good health and able to take ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and 
hydrocodone.  
▪ Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects who self-report  the following history will be excluded from participating:  
• Individual under the age of 18  
• History of gastrointestinal bleeding and/or peptic ulcer

4.2 Secondary Subjects  
N/A 
 
4.3 Number of Subjects  
 
A. Total Number of Subjects  
Phase 1: A maximum of 24 subjects will be enrolled , 12 males and 12 females . 
Phase 2: A maximum of 8 subjects will be enrolled , 4 males and 4 females at each clinical site . 
 
B. Total Number of Subjects If Multicenter Study  
Total study enrollment: 56 subjects  
 
C. Feasibility  
Phase 1: The RSDM Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic has performed previous 3rd molar pain studies.  These 
studies have enrolled about 5 patients per week.  Thus it is not anticipated that there will be any problem 
recruiting 24 patients over a 2 month period  enabling the study to be completed within 4 months . 
 
Phase 2: The other ins titutional sites are enrolling [ADDRESS_999217] enrollment over the student period.  
 
4.4 Consent Procedures  
 
A. Consent Process  
▪ Location of Consent Process  
Consent will be obtained while the patient is being seen in the dental clinic.  This is the same location 
in which informed consent is obtained for all dental procedures being performed at the dental school.  
▪ Ongoing Consent  
Study objectives, risks and benefits will be reviewed with the patient at the beginning of the Treatment 
Visit if the Treatment Visit is Separate from the Screening Visit and at the beginning of the Post -
Operative Visit.  While patients can withdraw their consent at any time, it is not expected that this will 
happen as the study protocol lasts for only 10 days.  Should a patient withdraw their consent, they will 
be instructed to immediately stop taking the study medication and return all unused medication t o the 
Clinical Co -Investigator.  
▪ Individual Roles for Researchers Involved in Consent  
The Clinical Co -Investigators and the Research Coordinator will obtain the informed consent.   
▪ Consent Discussion Duration  
It is estimated that it will take about 10-15 minutes to discuss the study purpose and obtain informed 
consent . 
▪ Coercion or Undue Influence  
The Clinical Co -Investigators will be asked to emphasize that participation in this study protocol is 
purely voluntarily.  They will be told to emphasize, t hat the dental treatment they will receive will not

4.7 Risks  of Harm /Potential for Benefits  to Subjects  
 
A. Description of Risks of Harm to Subject s 
▪ Reasonably Foreseeable Risks of Harm  
Each proposed analgesic has potential side effects.  These side effects include:  
• excessive fatigue or drowsiness  
• inability to concentrate  
• dizziness  
• euphoria (intense feeling of well -being & happi[INVESTIGATOR_008])  
• headache  
• nausea  
• vomiting  
• diarrhea  
• constipation  
• stomach  aches  
• heartburn  
• itching  
• skin rashes  
• urinary retention  
• unintentional weight gain  
Should these side effects become significant or bothersome, the patient will be instructed to stop taking 
the prescribed medication.   If additional analgesia is required, the subject will be instructed to call the 
emergency number.  Should the subject exp erience shortness of breath, or tachycardia, the subject will be 
instructed to immediately stop taking the study medication and call the emergency number.  Subjects will 
also be counseled on the addictive nature of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].

▪ Risk of Harm from an Interven tion on a Subject with an Existing Condition  
All study analgesics are commonly used to control post -operative pain today.  To be eligible to 
participate, subject must meet all inclusion and not have any exclusion criteria.  Thus subjects with 
existing conditions are not eligible to participate.   
▪ Other Foreseeable Risks of Harm  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_731486].  Care provided will include a PMDP query [ADDRESS_999220] will be able to speak to an addiction counselor.  Other 
foreseeable risks may include risks associated with a possible loss of confidentiality.   
▪ Observation and Sensitive Informa tion 
All information will be as confidential. . 
B. Procedures which  Risk  Harm  to Embryo, Fetus, and/or Pregnant Subjects  
Third molar surgery is the standard of care for patients who require third molar removal. All study analgesic 
medication is part of normal standard of care for post -surgical pain management  for men and for women 
who self -report not being pregnant.   Exposure is limited to a short post -operative period, generally [ADDRESS_999221] an individual or immediate family history (parents, siblings, children or spouse) of 
substance abuse are not eligible to participate as subjects thereby [CONTACT_731515]. 
Subjects will be instructed to not allow others,  including members of their household, to use their study 
medication.   Medication will be dispensed with childproof caps.  If patients follow these instructions, there 
are no known risk to non -subjects.  
E. Minimizing Risks  of Harm  
To minimize risks, patient s are being instructed to take their assigned analgesic medication only as needed 
after the first dose.  This will minimize exposure to subjects.  In addition, Individuals who have a personal 
or immediate family history (parents, siblings, children or spou se) of substance abuse are not eligible to 
participate as subjects thereby [CONTACT_731515].   Subjects will be instructed to not allow 
others, including members of their household, to use their study medication.   Medication will be dispen sed 
with childproof caps.  
▪ Certificate of Confidentiality  
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be issued automatically by [CONTACT_731516], 
sensitive information.  
▪ Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Data will be de -identified to protect subjects.

be deleted once all s ubjects have completed the protocol or a year from completing the first subject, whichever 
comes first.  
 
There could a breach of confidentiality but measures are in place to try and protect the subjects’ privacy.   
Provision of identifiable personal inform ation will be limited to the log maintained should the need to un -blind 
the medication become necessary.  Once a patient is enrolled, a study ID code will be assigned and used on all 
study materials, eliminating the need to place identifiable information o n the forms.  Thus, no other study 
material will not contain the patients name [CONTACT_731522].  Once the study is completed, 
the log containing patient names will be shredded.  
 
All study personnel have taken both HIPAA and CITI train ing.  All paper records, including the informed consents, 
subject logs, screening forms, medication logs, and patient diaries, will be stored in the PI’s office in locked file 
cabinets.  Electronic data will only be stored on drives which follow university  security policies.  Transmission of 
data will be through the RBHS e -mail system which transmits data in encrypted format.  Data will only be used 
on university computers which are password protected.   No identifiable patient information will be stored in  
any of the electronic files.   
 
6.3 Data and Safety Monitoring  
All Unanticipated problems (UP) and SAEs and will be reported to NIDCR, and the IRB.   
 
A. Data/Safety Monitoring  Plan  
Subject record review activities are done in real -time via checks programmed into REDCap , as well as,  manual 
reviews conducted by [CONTACT_25257] . 
 
Pre-programmed quality checks  
• Structured responses are required for the CRFs so only valid responses can be recorded.  In addition, 
REDCap has been programmed with all responses being r equired at time of completion.  
• Validation rules are employed where possible  
• Eligibility Criteria and Prohibited Medications: On the Eligibility Determination Form branching logic has 
been employed to sequentially revie w eligibility requirements and eliminate subjective eligibility scoring 
by [CONTACT_25257]  
o As an extra measure of quality control, before eligibility de termination is started, the Research 
Coordinator will confirm the subject received a printed si gned copy of the informed consent 
form.  This attestation is contained on the Eligibility Determination REDcap form.

Research Coordinator and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_731491], questionnaires and case reports which make up a 
participant’s study record  for the 10 subjects .  Results of the review and corrective actions will be provided in a 
summary report .  The data q uery process will be managed in REDCap via the Query Form and utilized to rectify 
identified issues in an appropriate time frame.   
 
AE and SAE Identification and Reporting:  Adverse events are expected due to the known nature of the FDA 
appro ved analgesic s.  An a dverse event  will be  documented the Adverse Event form while a s erious adverse event  
(SAE)  will be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event form  in REDCap .  Likewise, unanticipated problems will be 
reported on the Unanticipated Problems Form in REDCap.  Protocol Deviations and violations will be recorded on 
the Protocol Deviation/Violation Reporting Form in REDCap.  Reporting information is found below:  
 
 
 
 
Characteristics of an Adverse Event  
Each event will be recorded on an appropriate case report form that includes assessment of the characteristics 
defined below. These characteristics, along with the frequency of an event’s occurrence, will be considered in 
determining if the event is an unanticipated problem.  
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention the following guidelines are used:  
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite)  
a.  The event is known to occur with the study intervention, and/or  
b.  There is a temporal relationship between the inte rvention and event onset and/or  
c.  The event abates when the intervention is discontinued, and/or  
d.  The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the intervention.  
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related)  
a.  There is no temporal relationship between the i ntervention and event onset, and/or  
b.  An alternate etiology has been established.  
 
The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study -appointed, clinically/medically responsible individual will determine whether an AE 
is expected or unexpected. The following are considered expec ted adverse events  (associated with known 
adverse events from the study product) : 
a.  excessive fatigue or drowsiness

i.  constipation  
j.  stomach aches  
k.  heartburn  
l.  itching  
m.  skin rashes  
n.  urinary retention  
o.  unintentional weight gain  
 
Other Adverse Events will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is  not 
consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention.   
 
Severity of Adverse Event  
The severity of the adverse events will be graded by [CONTACT_731520].  
Subject will determine whether  they were bothered by [CONTACT_731521] a minor (no impact or minimal impact on 
activities of daily living and no intervention required) or major extent (moderate or significant impact on 
activities of daily living which may require the subject to stop taking the study analgesic or subject seeks medical 
attention.)   
Serious adverse events will be considered severe in extent as the symptoms are significant requiring

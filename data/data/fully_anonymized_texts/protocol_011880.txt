Subject Satisfaction Scale Grade Description 1 Very satisfied 2 Satisfied 3 Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied 4 Dissatisfied 5 Very dissatisfied 9.4 Safety  9.4.1 Adverse Events All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of suspected causal relationship to the study device will be recorded in the CRF. Subjects will be questioned for the occurrence of any new or worsening signs or symptoms at each visit. [IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a study device and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study device. AEs include any unfavorable and unintended illness, sign, symptom, clinically significant laboratory test abnormality, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study device that has appeared or worsened during the course of the clinical trial, regardless of causal relationship to the study device under study. The collection of non-serious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin following the subject's signature [CONTACT_56534]. [IP_ADDRESS] Documenting Adverse Experiences The PI [INVESTIGATOR_486875]. AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, AEs should be documented in terms of signs/symptoms observed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_486876]. Each AE that appears to be independent of any prior event will be reported separately. All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent form through the last study visit must be reported, regardless of AE causality. All AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded.  At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and ongoing AEs. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate CRF: • Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) • Onset date and end date • Maximum intensity (severity) • Seriousness • Action taken regarding study device • Corrective treatment, if given 
Clinical Trial Protocol ATM-[ADDRESS_625738]-2022 Confidential Page 16/25  
 • Outcome • Investigator assessment of causality [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events All AEs will be assessed as either serious or non-serious. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death • Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an AE) • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486877]. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE and must be reported per Reporting of SAEs under Section [IP_ADDRESS]. [IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs: • Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention/therapy required • Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required • Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_486878]; may be incapacitating or life threatening [IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality The PI [INVESTIGATOR_486879] “Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be considered when assessing AE causality: • Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study device. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study device and the AE. 
Clinical Trial Protocol ATM-[ADDRESS_625739]-2022 Confidential Page 17/25  
 • Not Related: There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE is related to the study device. This assessment implies that the AE/SAE has little or no temporal relationship to the study device and/or a more likely or certain alternative etiology exists. [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to ethica CRO within [ADDRESS_625740] Manager (or designate) within 24 hours of the PI’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile or email transmission and must be submitted on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the PI’s awareness of the event. PIs should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before notifying ethica CRO of an SAE. If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85154]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_486880], notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034]. When an SAE persists at the end of the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_284771]-up contacts with the subject until the PI/Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved and/or stabilized. [IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_486881] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If a subject or PI [INVESTIGATOR_486882], the study device must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study device and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study device, the study device must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study device will be permanently discontinued, and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy comes to term. All confirmed pregnancies must be reported via confirmed facsimile or email transmission and must be submitted on an Unanticipated Problems Reporting Form within 24 hours of the PI’s awareness of the pregnancy using the same reporting as procedure for an SAE under Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 10 STATISTICS There is no inferential statistical testing conducted for this study.  Descriptive data summaries will be prepared for all outcome variables.  For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects/observations in each category will be presented. The denominator will be based on the number of subjects/observations appropriate for the purpose of analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will

During this meeting, an extensive review and discussion of the protocol, all study procedures, source documents, and CRFs will be conducted. Evaluation scales will be reviewed extensively. The Clinical Project Manager(s) and Clinical Trial Associate(s) will be trained prior to study initiation. The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_1034] (or designate) following GCP guidelines. The reports of these verifications will also be archived with the study report. In addition, inspections or on-site audits may be carried out by [CONTACT_123356]/or federal authorities. The PIs will allow the Sponsor's representatives and any regulatory agency to examine all study records, corresponding subject medical records, clinical dispensing records and storage area, and any other documents considered source documentation. The PIs agree to assist the representative, if required. 11.[ADDRESS_625744] follow the instructions exactly. A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_486907]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual subjects or a small group of subjects and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or tolerability and cosmetic endpoint criteria. A protocol violation occurs when there is non-adherence to the protocol that results in a significant, additional risk to the subject, when the subject or PI [INVESTIGATOR_159021] (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the subject was enrolled without prior Sponsor approval, or when there is non-adherence to ICH GCP guidelines. The issue of noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the PI, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. All protocol deviations and violations must be addressed in study subject source documents. A completed copy of the ethica CRO Inc. Protocol Deviation Form must be maintained in the regulatory file, as well as in the subject’s source document. Protocol deviations must be sent to the IRB per its guidelines.

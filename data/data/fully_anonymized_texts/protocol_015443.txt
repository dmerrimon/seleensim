1 Introduction  
Bipolar I disorder is a lifelong epi[INVESTIGATOR_846451]. Psychotic symptoms (ie, delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders) often 
accompany the manic phase of bipolar I disorder. The lifetime prevalence of bipola r I 
disorder is estimated to be 0.4% to 1.6% with a mean age of onset for first manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_846452] 20s.[ADDRESS_1176911] -line treatment for acute mania 
across multiple United  States (US) and international treatment guidelines based on 
established evidence.2,3,4,5 Although the availability of newer atypi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l antipsychotics has 
increased the therapeutic options in the treatment of manic and depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_846453] I disorder, there still remains a need for safer and more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_846454].6 
Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (also referred to as OPC -[ZIP_CODE] and Lu AF41156) is a novel atypi[INVESTIGATOR_826296].

action of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_826297], the pharmacology 
of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_572534] a combination of high binding affinity and 
functional activities at multiple monoaminergic receptors. It has modulatory activity at 
the serotonin (5 -HT) and dopamine systems that combines partial agonist activi ty at 
serotonergic [ADDRESS_1176912] activity at 
serotonergic 5 -HT 2A receptors, with similar high affinities at all of these receptors (K i: 
0.1 - 0.5 nM). Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846456] α 1B/2C with 
affinity in the same subnanomolar K i range (K i: 0.2 - 0.6 nM). The 5 -HT 1A/D2 receptor 
partial agonist activity in combination with 5 -HT 2A and α 1B/2C receptors antagonism of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846457], reduced 
impulsive behavior, and cognitive improvement.7 This receptor activity profile may also  
prove an effective target for the treatment of acute mania of bipolar I disorder.

1.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Phase 1 data indicated that brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846459] 0.2 to 6 mg and at a repeated dose of 
2 mg/day. Data from completed repeated dosing trials in the US indicate tha t 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846460] 12 mg/day; when administered 
to subjects with MDD at doses of up to 4 mg/day in combination with a marketed 
antide pressant; up to 3 mg/day as adjunctive therapy in elderly subjects (70 -85 years of 
age) with MDD; and when administered to subjects with ADHD at doses of up to 4 
mg/day in combination with a marketed stimulant.  
Please refer to the current IB for a summary of available nonclinical and clinical safety

Brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_297562] a novel antipsychotic that is a serotonin -dopamine activity modulator 
and is indicated in the US as monotherapy for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult 
patients (2 -4 mg/day) and as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for the treatment of 
MDD (2 -3 mg/day).[ADDRESS_1176914] proven efficacy in the treatment of bipolar I 
disorder. This multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial will  be 
conducted to e valuate the safety and efficacy of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_123107] (2 -4 mg/day, 
with a starting dose of 2 mg/day) for the acute treatment of manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], with or  
without mixed features, in subjects with bipolar I disorder.  
2.2 Dosing Rationale  
The dosing paradigm of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_444418] 331 -201-[ZIP_CODE] has been 
determined based on the current approved dosing ranges and phase 3 trial results across 
related psychiatric indications (MDD and schizophrenia) and on dosing paradigms used 
in the development of other atypi[INVESTIGATOR_846461] I disorder. In 
general, for most atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], the recommended dosing range and maximal 
doses tend to be comparable for subjects with either schizophrenia or bipolar I acute 
mania . 
During the double -blind period, subjects will receive a starting dose of 2 mg/day of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (or corresponding placebo) from Days 1 to 3, followed by [CONTACT_13608]  
3 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (or placebo) on Day 4. Subjects may be titrated (or re -titrate d) to 
a higher dose of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (or placebo), up to a maximum of 4 mg/day, based on 
treatment response and at the investigator’s discretion anytime at Day 7 or thereafter.  
Subjects who are unable to tolerate their current dose can be titrated down at any time to 
a minimum of 2 mg/day. Dose adjustments must be made in increments of 1 mg/day.  
Subjects who are unable to tolerate 2 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846462]. This paradigm is within the currently approved recommended dose rang e for 
schizophrenia, ie, 2 to 4 mg/day, but with a more rapid titration schedule. A higher 
starting dose and faster titration for acute mania is proposed to reach the target dose  
quickly, without resulting in undesirable side effects. This decision is cons istent with  
Confidential - Proprietary Information  [ADDRESS_1176915] to the starting doses and recommended dose ranges. In addition, this is consistent 
with previously tested dosing paradigms for brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846463]. This 
includes trials with higher starting doses without titration (up to 12 mg/day), and with  
more rapid titration schedules (Trials 331 -07-203, 331 -08-205, and 14644A).  
2.3 Trial Objectives  
Primary:  To demonstrate the efficacy of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846464], with or without mixed features, in subjects with a 
diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.  
To confirm the safety and tolerability of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846465].  Secondary:

3.1 Trial Design  
Type/Design of Trial  
This will be a 3 -week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of 
brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846466] I disorder (current manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_846467]) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5; updated terminology replaces “mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]” with 
the descriptor of “mixed features”). The total duration of the trial is up to 8 weeks, 
including screening, double -blind treatment, and follow -up. See Figure 3.1 -1 for a 
schematic of the trial design.  
The trial will be organized as follows:

identification (ID) number for each subject with documented consent. Although the 
screening period will continue up to administration of the first dose of inves tigational 
medicinal product (IMP), screening procedures should be initiated with a sufficient 
amount of time allotted in order to obtain laboratory results and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
results from the central reader prior to randomization. The sponsor res erves the right to 
utilize external quality oversight methods to ensure the validity of diagnosis, severity of 
illness, and other factors determining appropriateness of subject selection.  
All subjects must agree to discontinue all prohibited medications du ring the screening 
period in order to meet the protocol -specified washout periods.  
Treatment Phase: Following the screening period, subjects who meet all inclusion 
criteria, including a score of ≥ 24 on the Young -Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)8 at 
screening and baseline, and meet none of the exclusion criteria, will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_92563] 3 weeks. Subjects will receive a 
starting dose of 2 mg/day of brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (or correspondin g placebo) from Days 1 to 3, 
followed by [CONTACT_13608] 3 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (or placebo) on Day 4. Further dose  
increases up to 4 mg/day may occur no earlier than Day 7 at the investigator’s discretion 
based on treatment response.  Subjects who are unable to tolerate their current dose can 
be titrated down at any time to a minimum of 2 mg/day. Subjects may be re -titrated back 
to higher dose levels based on investigator discretion. Dose adjustments must be made in 
increments of 1 mg/day. Subjects who are unable to tolerate 2 mg/day brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846471]. All subjects will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18552] d for a minimum of the 
first [ADDRESS_1176917] clinically improved from their baseline assessments with mild to no 
manic symptoms, and are stable enough to be treated on an outpatient basis, including no 
risk of suicide as assessed by [CONTACT_48649] -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), 
may be discharged and will continue as outpatients for the last week of double -blind 
treatment. Subjects who do not meet these criteria wi ll remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_846472] [ADDRESS_1176918] are required at the Day 21/Early Termination (ET) visit for 
subjects who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_846473] 2 (Day 14) to verify 
continue d compliance with the protocol.  
Follow -up Phase: If any subject discontinues the trial early, every effort should be made 
to complete the Day 21/ET assessments as soon as possible and prior to starting any new 
medication or treatment. Subjects who complete  all trial visits through the Day [ADDRESS_1176919] or in clinic visit 21 (± 2) days after the last dose of

[IP_ADDRESS].2  Measurement of Vital Signs  
The measurement of vital signs will include body weight, body temperature, systolic  
blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate. The following 
guidelines will aid in the standardization of body weight measurements:  

The same scale should be used to weigh a given subject each time, if possible. 
Scales shou ld be calibrated and reliable; scales should be at zero just prior to each 
subject’s weigh -in session.  
A subject should void prior to being weighed and be minimally clothed (ie, no 
shoes or heavy overgarments).  
Weight should be recorded before a subject’s meal and at approximately the same  
time at each visit.  

Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be made in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_846498] [ADDRESS_1176967] followed by [CONTACT_117777].  
Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension (screening DBP > 95 mmHg in any position) or 
symptomatic hypotension are excluded from the trial as are subjects with orthostati c 
hypotension defined as a decrease of ≥ 30 mmHg in SBP and/or a decrease of  
≥ [ADDRESS_1176968] 3 minutes standing compared to the previous supi[INVESTIGATOR_846499] (see Table 3.4.3 -1). In addition, subjects 
should be excluded if they have any other vital sign measurement at screening that, in the 
investigator’s judgment, is medically significant in that it would impact the safety of the 
subject or the interpretation of the trial results. H owever, any abnormal screening vital 
sign result(s) considered to be clinically significant should be repeated to confirm the 
finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial. Appendix [ADDRESS_1176969]’s medical history and clinical presentation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogram Assessments  
All ECG recordings will be obtained after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_178664] 5 minutes. Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be obtained at the investigator’s 
discretion and should always be obtained in the event of an ET. Electrocardiogram 
result s will be evaluated at the investigational site to determine the subject’s eligibility  
and to monitor safety during the trial. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_846500] - Proprietary Information  46 Version 2.0, 21 Dec 2017

are of clinical significance. The ECG will be repeated if a ny results are considered to be 
clinically significant.  A central ECG service will be utilized for reading all ECGs in 
order to standardize interpretations for the safety  analysis.  
If, according to the investigator's judgment, any abnormal ECG finding is deemed 
medically significant (impacting the safety of the subject and/or the interpretation of the 
trial results) or meets an exclusion criterion (see Table 3.4.3 -1), the subject should be 
excluded from the trial. Abnormal re sults for ECGs should be repeated once at screening 
with [ADDRESS_1176970] based on the criteria noted above. Each ECG recording should be 
taken approximately 5 minutes apar t (the ECG result reported will be evaluated at each 
time point). The central ECG service will provide the corrections for the 3 ECGs 
performed. Based on the QT interval corrected for heart rate by [CONTACT_6550]’s formula 
(QTcF) reported by [CONTACT_846541] e, a subject will be excluded if the corrections are ≥ 
450 msec in men and ≥ 470 msec in women for 2 of the 3 time points of the ECGs done,

All attempts should be made to avoid treatment interruption during the trial. For subjects 
who have an interruption of treatment, the investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_826365]. The investigator and medical monitor will c ome as 
quickly as possible to a joint decision regarding the subject’s continuation in the trial.  
This decision will be documented by [CONTACT_663563]. The 
treatment interruption will be recorded via eSource and also recorded as a p rotocol

[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Discontinuation  
After randomization, a subject may stop treatment permanently for a variety of reasons. 
Treatment discontinuations may be initiated by a subject who  is not satisfied with 
treatment or may become medically necessary due to AEs, required treatment with a 
disallowed medication or therapy, or other issues, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
However, each investigator must comprehensively review the circum stances and offer the 
subject options for continued treatment to the degree possible as described in  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Documenting Reasons for Treatment Discontinuation  
A subject may discontinue IMP for a number of reasons including those listed below:  
 Reasons related to  AE: 
Subject decides to discontinue because of annoyance or discomfort due to a 
non-serious AE which is not otherwise determined to be an undue hazard  
Continuing IMP places the subject at undue risk as determined by [CONTACT_093] 
(eg, a safety concern that i s possibly, probably, or likely related to IMP)  
 SAE  
 Other potentially IMP -related safety concerns or  AEs 
 Death

If the subject discontinues IMP due to an AE, the investigator, or other trial personnel,  
will make every effort to follow the event until it has resolved or stabilized. Follow up 
procedures in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be followed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal of Consent  
All subjects have the right to withdraw their co nsent from further participation in the trial 
at any time without prejudice. Subjects cannot withdraw consent for use of data already 
collected as part of the trial, but only for future participation. The investigator can also 
discontinue a subject’s parti cipation in the trial at any time if medically necessary.  
Unless the subject provides their written withdrawal of consent or there is other written 
documentation by [CONTACT_444470]’s verbal intent to completely 
withdraw from the tri al, subjects should be followed for all protocol -specified evaluations 
and assessments, if possible.  
Complete withdrawal of consent requires a subject’s refusal of ALL of the following 
methods of follow up (these methods of follow up will also be noted in the trial ICF):  
Participation in all follow -up procedures specified in the protocol (whether in -clinic, 
by [CONTACT_756], or by [CONTACT_28920] -home visit).  
Participation in a subset of protocol specified follow -up procedures (by a frequency 
schedule and method, as agreed by [CONTACT_330210]).  
Contact [CONTACT_330211], even if only by [CONTACT_756], to assess current 
medical condition, and obtain  necessary medical or laboratory reports relevant to the 
trial’s objectives.  
Contact [CONTACT_308705](s) who have been designated in source records as being 
available to discuss the subject’s medical condition, even if only by [CONTACT_756], mail, 
or e-mail (eg, family, spouse, partner, legal representative, friend, neighbor, or 
physician).  
Access to medical information from alternative sources (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic medical 
records, referring doctor’s notes, public records, dialysis, transplantation or vita l 
registries, social media sources).  


Confidential - Proprietary Information  [ADDRESS_1176976]’s intended withdrawal need to be completely unders tood, 
documented, and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity of the trial. 
A subject may initially express their desire to discontinue IMP administration, which is 
not equivalent to a complete withdrawal of consent for further parti cipation (see  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). A subject may, however, indicate that further trial participation is 
creating a burden on their work or social schedule. Therefore, the investigator should 
follow the procedures outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] to determine if the subject can continue 
participation in the trial if modifications to his/her treatment and/or schedule of 
assessments can be accommodated. Only subjects who withdraw their permission for all 
of the above degrees of follow -up are considered to have completely withdrawn their  
consent to participate in the trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures to Encourage Continued Trial Participation  
In all cases of impending IMP discontinuation or consent withdrawa l, investigators will 
be given instructions to meet and discuss with the subject their options of continuing in 
the trial, preferably on therapy. The investigator should ensure understanding and  
documentation of the reasons for the subject’s desire to with draw consent.  
3.[ADDRESS_1176977] is one from whom informed consent is obtained and is 
documented in writing (ie, subject signs an ICF), but who is not randomized or assigned 
trial treatment.  
Screen failures may be rescreened at any time if the exclusion characteristic has changed. 
Subjects who sign an ICF but who are not started on treatment are permitted to be 
rescreened. In the event that the subject is rescreened for trial participation, an d the 
rescreening is not completed within the original screening window, a new ICF must be  
signed.  
3.10 Definition of Completed Subjects  
The treatment period is defined as the time period during which subjects are evaluated for 
primary and/or seco ndary objectives of the trial irrespective of whether or not the subject 
actually consumed all doses of the IMP. Subjects who are evaluated at the last scheduled 
visit during the treatment period will be defined as trial completers. For purposes of this  
trial, subjects who complete Day [ADDRESS_1176978] a known reason for discontinuation (eg, withdrew consent or AE), and 
for whom a survival status at the end of the trial cannot be determined will be cla ssified 
as “lost to follow -up” as the reason for discontinuation. Survival status can be 
determined from a variety of sources, either by [CONTACT_788495] (ie, death certificate, medical records, public records, statement by a fa mily 
member or primary care physician) or acceptable documentation for life (ie, direct 
contact [CONTACT_1155], medical records, successful telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], 
statement by a family member or primary care physician, or public records).  
The site will make [ADDRESS_1176979] via certified mail or an alternative similar method, where approp riate, before  
assigning a “lost to follow -up” status.  
3.[ADDRESS_1176980]’s trial records. Subjects must be 
counseled on the importance of taking the IMP as directed at all trial visits. If poor 
compl iance continues (eg, multiple missed doses resulting in less than 80% overall 
compliance at any point in the trial), discontinuation of the subject from the trial should 
be considered. The medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_846543] n 
whether a subject's lack of compliance merits discontinuation from the trial.  
3.13 Protocol Deviations  
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or 
mistake (eg, violation of informed consent process, IMP dispensing or subject dosing 
error, treatment assignment error, subject enrolled in violation of eligibility  criteria or 
concomitant medication criteria), the investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_846544]. The investigator and medical monitor 
will come as quickly as possible to a joint decision regarding the  subject’s continuation in 
the trial. This decision will be documented by [CONTACT_663563],

conditions that are pre -existing or that develop during the trial (intercurrent illness or 
AEs). The investigator should examine the acceptability of all concomitant medications 
not e xplicitly prohibited. In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is 
administered, it is essential that subjects be instructed not to take any medications (either 
self-administered non -prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by [CONTACT_846547]) without prior consultation with the investigator. In particular, the investigator  
should caution the subject about concomitant use of the following during the trial:  
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or other drugs that interfere with 
coagulation since the combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with

it will mandate IMP discontinuation and must be reported on the clinical trial 
pregnancy and breastfeeding form, or other designated form, to the sponsor.  
Confidential - Propr ietary Information  [ADDRESS_1176990] Value Changes : It is the investigator’s responsibility to review 
the results of all laboratory tests as they become available. This review will be 
documented by [CONTACT_093]’s dated signature [CONTACT_444495]. For each 
abnormal laboratory test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinically significant) change from baseline for that individual subject. This 
determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an a bnormal 
value is observed. The investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional 
tests to verify the results of the original laboratory tests. If this laboratory value is 
considered medically relevant by [CONTACT_093] (subject is symptom atic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory value leads to 
discontinuation, and/or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered an AE.  
Severity:  Adverse events will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported as indicated on 
the ePlatform. The intensity of an adverse experience is defined as follows:  
1 = Mild:  
2 = Moderate:  
3 = Severe:  Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity. 
Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.  
Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
IMP Causality:  Assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the use of the IMP  is 
defined as follows:  
Related : There is a reasonable possibility of a temporal and causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.  
There is no temporal or causal relationship between the IMP and 
the AE.  Not Related : 
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events  
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of AEs. To avoid 
bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the non -leading question: “How have you 
felt since your last visit?” All AEs (s erious and nonserious) reported by [CONTACT_846548]. All AE collection is  to 
begin after a subject has signed the ICF.

courier to the sponsor. (Please note that the IRE form is NOT the AE ePlatform.)  
Subjects experiencing SAEs should be followed clinically until their health has returned 
to baseline status, or until all parameters have returned to normal or have otherwise been 
explained. It is expected that the investigator will provide or arrange appropriate 
supportive care for the subject and will provide prompt updates on the subject’s status to  
the sponsor.

The contraceptive method will be documented at each trial visit.  
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, investigators must review the below 
guidelines about trial participation with all WOCBP. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_846514]:

Contraceptives in current use  
Guidelines for the follow -up of a reported pregnancy  
Before trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an ICF stating that the above -mentioned risk factors 
and the consequences were discussed with her.  
A urine and/or serum pregnancy test for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) will be 
performed at screening on all WOCBP. If a urine test is performed and is positive, the 
investigator will follow up with a confirmat ory serum test.  
During the trial, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_229784] (eg, missed or late menstrual cycle).  
If a subject is suspected to be pregnant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy tests are available.  If the 
pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must not be enrolle d in 
the trial. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be 
withheld immediately (if reasonable, taking into consideration any potential withdrawal 
risks) until the result of the pregnancy test is known. If pregnancy is confi rmed, the IMP 
will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering  if 
necessary for subject safety) and the subject will be withdrawn from the trial.

Protocol -required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow -up must b e performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered, if indicated. In addition, the 
investigator must report to the sponsor, on appropriate Pregnancy Surv eillance Form(s), 
follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal outcome. Infants will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1176998] the sponsor/Clinical Research Organization 
(CRO) medical advisor to discuss their rationale for unblinding. However, to prevent 
delays to the investigator or medical personnel responding to a potentially emergent 
situation, unblinding of IMP will not be dependent upon the investigator receiving 
approval from the sponsor/CRO medical advisor (ie, the investigator will be able to 
obtain the code break information independent of the sponsor/CRO medical advisor). 
The inv estigator must contact [CONTACT_456]/CRO medical advisor by [CONTACT_16062] e -mail 
with an explanation of the need for opening the treatment assignment code within [ADDRESS_1176999] be notified immediately (see the cover page of this 
protocol for contact [CONTACT_3031]). Documentation of breaking the blind should be

the names of the pe rsonnel involved. Once the blind is broken for a subject, that subject  
may not reinitiate treatment with the IMP.

7 Statistical Analysis  
Complete details of the planned statistical analysis will be presented in the statistical  
analysis plan (SAP).  
7.1 Sample Size  
It is anticipated that approximately 320 subjects will be randomized from an estimated 
45 sites in the US and Europe.  The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from 
baseline to Day 21 in the double -blind treatment phase in the YMRS Total Score. The 
trial will compare the placebo arm to the brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_846449], randomized at a ratio of  1:1, 
with an overall significance level of 0.05 (2 -sided) for the primary endpoint.  
The planned sample size of 304  
evaluable subjects (152 in each treatment arm) will yield at least 90% power to detect the 
treatment effects at a 2 -tailed significance level of 0.05.  
A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled and randomized to achieve  
approximately 304 evaluable  subjects in the double -blind treatment phase CCI 
the total number of subjects to be randomized is 320  
(160 in each treatment arm).  
In order to ensure 304 evaluable subjects, CCI

Randomized Sample: comprises all subjects who were randomized in the double -blind 
treatment phase. Subjects are considered randomized when they are assigned a treatment 
number by [CONTACT_846551]. A subject receiving IMP outside of the IWRS 
will not be considered randomized, but safety will be reported.  
Safety Sample: comprises those randomized subjects in the double -blind treatment phase 
who received at least [ADDRESS_1177004].  
Subjects will be exclude d from this population only if there is documented evidence (ie, 
drug dispensed = drug returned or no IMP dispensed) that the subject did not take IMP. If 
a subject is dispensed IMP and is lost to follow up, he/she will be considered exposed.  
Efficacy Samp le: the Full Analysis Set comprises all subjects in the Safety Sample who 
have a baseline value and at least [ADDRESS_1177005]’s level of manic 
symptoms. The YMRS consists of 11 items: 1) elevated mood, 2) increased motor 
activity -energy, 3) sexual interest, 4) sleep, 5) irritability, 6) speech (rate and amount),  
7) language -thought disorder, 8) content, 9) disruptive -aggressive behavior,  
10)  appearance, and 11) insight. Seven items are rated on a 0 - to 4-scale, while four 
items (Items 5, 6, 8, and 9) are rated on a 0 - to 8-scale with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 being the 
possible scores (twice the weight of the other items). For all items, 0 is the “best” rating 
and the highest score (4 or 8) is the ‘worst’ rating. The YMRS Total Score is the sum of 
ratings for all 11 items; therefore, possible total scores range from [ADDRESS_1177006] model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis with an 
unstructured variance covariance structure in which the change from the  baseline  in 
YMRS Total Score during the double -blind treatment phase will be the dependent

3 periods:  
A period of at least 2 years after the date on which approval to market the drug is 
obtained (or if IMP development is discontinued, the date regulatory authorities were 
notified of discontinuation); OR  
A period of at least 3 years after the sponsor notifi es the investigator that the final 
report has been filed with regulatory authorities.  
Longer, region -specific storage requirements, if applicable.  

The investigator must not dispose of any records relevant to this trial without either  
(1) writt en permission from the sponsor or (2) provision of an opportunity for sponsor to 
collect such records. The investigator will be responsible to maintain adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated 
during this trial including any data clarification forms received from the sponsor. Such 
documentation is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_331692]. 
If the investigator withdraws from the trial (eg, due to relocation or retirem ent), all trial - 
related records should be transferred to a mutually agreed -upon designee within a 
sponsor -specified timeframe. Notice of such transfer will be given to the sponsor in  
writing.  
10 Quality Control and Quality  Assurance  
10.1 Monitoring  
The sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to follow this trial in accordance 
with established research principles, the ICH E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance, and 
applicable regulatory requirements and local laws. As part of a con certed effort to fulfill 
these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge of the progress of the trial), the 
sponsor's monitors will visit the site during the trial, as well as communicate frequently 
via telephone, e -mail, and written communications.  In addition, all investigators and 
clinical site personnel will undergo initial and ongoing training for this particular trial,  
and this training will be clearly documented.

10.2 Auditing  
The sponsor's Quality Assurance Unit (or representative) may conduct trial site audits. 
Audits will include, but are not limited  to, IMP supply, presence of required documents, 
the informed consent process, and comparison of ePlatform with source documents. The 
investigator agrees to participate with audits.  
Regulatory authorities may inspect the investigator site during or after t he trial. The 
investigator will cooperate with such inspections and will contact [CONTACT_331687].  
[ADDRESS_1177022] be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA regulations, ICH GCP 
Guideline (E6), international ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki 
and Council for International Organizations of Medical Science (CIOMS) guidelin es, and 
applicable local laws and regulations. Each trial site will seek approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_826343], and the investigator will provide 
that documentation to the sponsor. The IRB/IEC will evaluate the ethi cal, scientific and 
medical appropriateness of the trial. Further, in preparing and handling ePlatform, the 
investigator, sub -investigator and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in 
protecting subject privacy.  To this end, a subject num ber and subject ID code will be 
used to identify each  subject.  
Financial aspects, subject insurance and the publication policy for the trial will be 
documented in the agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.  
12 Confidentiality  
All information generated in this trial will be considered confidential and will not be 
disclosed to anyone not directly concerned with the trial without the sponsor’s prior 
written permission.  Subject confidentiality requirements of the region(s) where t he trial  
is conducted will be met. However, authorized regulatory officials and sponsor personnel 
(or their representatives) may be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records, 
consistent with local requirements.  All IMPs, subject bodily fluids, and/or other  
materials collected shall be used solely in accordance with this protocol, unless  otherwise  
agreed to in writing by [CONTACT_456].  
Confidential - Proprietary Information  [ADDRESS_1177023] ID is required, subjects’ full names may be made known to a regulatory agency or  
other authorized officials if necessary, subject to local regulations.  
13 Amendment Policy  
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent and subsequent approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_216339]. Any 
permanent change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial 
site(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment will be written by [CONTACT_103]. Each amendment will be submitted to the IRB/IEC, as required by [CONTACT_13125]. Except for “administrative” or “non -substantial” amendments, investigators 
will wait for IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_444443](s). Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect 
on the safety of subjects, conduct or management of the trial, t rial design, or the quality  
or safety of IMP(s) used in the trial. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately after agreement by [CONTACT_331694], followed by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC noti fication within local applicable 
timelines. The sponsor will submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory 
agencies within local applicable timelines.  
When the IRB/IEC, investigators, and/or the sponsor conclude that the protocol 
amendment substa ntially alters the trial design and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currently approved written ICF will require similar modification. In such 
cases, after approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_331644]/IEC, repeat written 
informed  consent will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the trial before expecting 
continued participation and before the amendment -specified changes in the trial are  
implemented.  
[ADDRESS_1177024] of this trial 
will be based on International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship 
criteria (http://www.i cmje.org/recommendations).  According to ICMJE guidelines, one 
may be considered an author only if the following criteria are met:  
1. Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the

Appendix 15  Protocol Amendment(s)/Administrative Change(s)  
Amendment Number:  1 
Issue Date:  21 Dec 2017  
PURPOSE:  
The purpose of amending the Protocol 331 -201-[ZIP_CODE], issued 24 May 2017, was to:  
Update the document with minor wording revisions for grammatical and 
administrative clarification  
Remove an incorrect exclusion criteria in Section 3.1  
Add clarifying details on administration of the Clinical Global Impressions – Bipolar 
Scale assessment  
Add information on retesting subjects with elevated lithium, valproate, or 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_846515] t he efficacy scales in the appendices to match the licensed versions currently 
available  




BACKGROUND:  
The rationale for the changes in this protocol amendment is as follows:  
The exclusion criteria of ≥ 30% decrease in YMRS between screening and baseline 
was removed from Section 3.[ADDRESS_1177030] is scored based on change from the 
baseline visit. In th e previous version of the scale, the reference point was "preceding 
phase" and this caused some confusion among raters. As a result, the version of the 
CGI-BP that uses “change from baseline” was used to avoid any confusion about the 
point of reference wil l be used  
The use of anticholinergics was intended from the beginning of study, as this is 
consistent with current clinical practice, but was omitted by [CONTACT_846562]. This change is not based on any new findings from the 
ongoing studies.  

aScreening begins when the ICF is s igned and will take place between Day −14 and Day −1; however, screening procedures should be initiated with a 
sufficient amount of time allotted in order to obtain laboratory results and ECG results from the central reader prior to ran domization. Review o f 
inclusion/exclusion criteria at baseline will be based on assessments performed during screening. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_846518]. Note: In the rare circu mstance when a subject must leave the inpatient facility  
temporarily (eg, family emergency or doctor visit), a temporary day pass may be granted. For such a request, sites must first  contact [CONTACT_846565]. A medical monitor approved day pass is good for the day requested only, and  
subjects must return to the site the same day (eg, in the evening).

rate will be measured in the following order: supi[INVESTIGATOR_444399] [ADDRESS_1177036] for  5 minutes prior to the ECG. A central ECG service will be 
utilized to review all ECGs in order to standardize interpretations for the safety analysis. In addition, ECG results will be  evaluated at the investigational 
site to monitor safety during the tria l. Any screening ECG with abnormal result(s) considered to be clinically significant should be repeated to confirm the 
finding(s) before excluding the subject from the trial. Subjects will be randomized based on screening ECG results from the c entral reade r and baseline 
ECG results from the trial site. If the baseline ECG results from the central reader, when available, indicate a QT interval corrected for heart rate by 
[CONTACT_6550]’s formula (QTcF) ≥ 450 msec in men and ≥ [ADDRESS_1177037]’s continued participation in the trial. ECGs scheduled for the same visit as blood sam ples are to be completed before 
blood is drawn.

lIf lithium, valproate, or carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_846490], they may be reassessed prior to randomization.  
mAll positive urine pregnancy test results must be confirmed by a serum test. Subjects with positive urine and se rum pregnancy test results at screening must 
not be enrolled. Subjects with positive urine and serum pregnancy test results during the trial must discontinue treatment an d be withdrawn from the trial. 
Pregnancy tests can be performed at any point during th e trial if pregnancy is suspected.  
nA urine drug screen and a blood alcohol test are required at the designated times, but either or both can be conducted at any  time during the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
oThe “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed for all subjects at screening to determine elgibility and the “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will  
be completed at the baseline visit to assure that the subject continued to qualify for the trial. Any subject with suicidal i deation wi thin the last [ADDRESS_1177039] 2 years, or who in the clinical judgment of the investigator presents a serious risk of su icide should be excluded from the 
trial (see Table 3.4.3 -1). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be com pleted at all visits after the baseline visit.  
pAdverse events will be recorded starting after the subject signs the ICF.  
rSite staff will provide IMP to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_846491]. If a subject is discharged at Day 14,  the site should counsel the subject 
on the importance of taking IMP as directed.

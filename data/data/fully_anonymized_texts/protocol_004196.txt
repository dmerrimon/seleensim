TITLE: 
A Long-term Study to Evaluate Growth and Development Outcomes in Patients with Infantile-Onset 
Pompe Disease Who Are Receiving Alglucosidase Alfa 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY CENTERS: 
The number of study centers will not be limited prospectively. 
OBJECTIVES: 
The overall objective is to evaluate long-term growth and development of patients with infantile-onset 
Pompe disease who begin treatment with alglucosidase alfa before [ADDRESS_243919] of alglucosidase alfa 
treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated.  For research purposes only, cross-reacting immunologic material (CRIM) status and GAA mutation analysis will be evaluated. 
METHODOLOGY: 
This is a multicenter study of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease who begin alglucosidase alfa 
treatment prior to [ADDRESS_243920] birthday will be followed in this study for 10 years.

AUTHORITY USE ONLY: 
 Alglucosidase alfa will be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight as prescribed by [CONTACT_204385] 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion.  If clinically feasible, all patients will continue at the same dose throughout the study.  Any modification to the dose and/or frequency of dosing is not permitted unless it is due to disease progression or to an adverse event (AE), in which case it is not a protocol deviation, but the Investigator must consult with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and Global Safety Officer in the event of a dose change.  The dosing change and the reasons for it will be documented on 
the appropriate case report forms.  
It is recommended that the reconstitution and admi nistration instructions in the current prescribing 
information be followed. Patients who meet specific criteria may have the option for home infusions.  Because of the possibility of 
anaphylactic reactions, personnel competent in rec ognizing and treating adverse reactions (including 
anaphylactic reactions) should be readily available throughout the home infusion.  The following criteria must be documented in the patient’s medical record: 
o The patient must be clinically stable with no history of moderate or severe IARs within [ADDRESS_243924] no ongoing serious adverse events (SAEs) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may impact the patient’s ability to tolerate infusion. 
o The home infusion agency staff must be trained by [CONTACT_204386].  Any new staff member must be trained by [CONTACT_204386]. 
o The home infusion agency staff must have access to and be trained on proper safety equipment, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment. 
o If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions occur, the Investigator should 
assess whether or not it is safe for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion. 
Genzyme should be notified about all IARs and consulted (as needed) if the patient experiences IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section 9.5.2 ). 
o Home Infusion Agency must keep source documentation of the infusion, including documentation of any AEs.  Home Infusion Agen cy must be amenable to providing specific 
source documentation to Genzyme and agree to be monitored.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_204351]’s safety even when delegating infusion 
responsibilities to the home care company. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_204352] a patient’s initiation with home infusions and is ultimately responsible for the safety of the patient during this clinical study.  Refer to the Study Manual and Home Infusion Manual for further details regarding home infusions. 
REFERENCE TREATMENT: 
There will be no comparator treatment or placebo in this study. 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: Efficacy
: The following efficacy assessments will be performed at scheduled visits during the study: 
• Growth as measured by [CONTACT_204387]/height, weight and head circumference

AUTHORITY USE ONLY: 
• Motor development and function, as measured by [CONTACT_204388] (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) and Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) 
• Cognitive Development, as measured by [CONTACT_204389] (Bayley-III) (up to 42 months of age), change in the 
Brief IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale – Revised (Leiter-R) and/or the change in the Nonverbal IQ score of the Leiter International Performance Scale - 3
rd Edition 
(Leiter-3) (starting at the final assessment of the Bayley-III before 42 months of age). 
For patients treated with alglucosidase alfa prior to age 1 (prior to study entry), available retrospective growth and development data will be collected.  Parameters for retrospective data collection will include 
available standard-of-care growth (height, weight, head circumference) and motor milestone information 
(e.g. head support, sitting, standing, and walking ability) from the time of treatment initiation. 
Safety
: The following safety assessments will be performed during the study: AE monitoring, laboratory 
tests (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), anti-rhGAA antibody (immunoglobulin G [IgG]) 
collection, neuroimaging (at the discretion of the Investigator), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature), physical examin ations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), hearing testing 
and visual screening. 
Additional safety evaluations will include the assessment of: (1) immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum 
tryptase, complement activation and skin testing, when clinically indicated following moderate, severe, or recurrent IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity; and (2) circulating immune complex detection when clinically indicated by [CONTACT_204390]. 
Inhibitory antibody (activity and uptake) will be assessed when clinically indicated (e.g., requirement for 
new invasive ventilator use, plateau or decline in response in the presence of adequate dosing). 
EXPLORATORY: 
The effect of alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated. 
RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY: 
The potential effect of CRIM status and GAA mutation on efficacy outcomes will be analyzed. 
STATISTICAL METHODS: 
The statistical analysis of all growth and developmen t parameters and other efficacy outcomes and safety 
measurements will be conducted on all patients who receive alglucosidase alfa.  All data collected in this 
study will be documented using summary tables, figures and patient data listings.  For categorical 
variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented.  For continuous variables, descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) will be presented.   
Analyses will be performed using the SAS® statistical software system.  Detailed descriptions of the 
analyses will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 4. INTRODUCTION 
Pompe disease is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic muscle disease caused by [CONTACT_204392] α glucosidase (GAA), an enzyme that degrades lysosomal glycogen. As opposed to the 
exclusively cytoplasmic accumulation of glycogen that occurs in other glycogen storage disorders, Pompe disease is characterized by  [CONTACT_204393] (lysosomal) and extra-lysosomal 
accumulation of glycogen in many body tissues, ultimately leading to multisystemic pathology. 
Historically, Pompe disease has been arbitrarily classified into different subtypes based on the 
age at onset of symptoms, extent of organ i nvolvement, and rate of progression to death.  
Essentially, there is a broad spectrum of disease ranging from a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_204354] 
(infantile-onset) to a more slowly progressive form (late-onset) with considerable variability and 
overlap existing between these extremes ( Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today ; Hirschhorn, 2001, The 
Metabolic and Molecular Base s of Inherited Disease ; van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics ).  It is 
important to note that all pres entations of Pompe disease shar e a common underlying pathology; 
i.e., deficiency of GAA with subsequent accumulation of glycogen.  
At the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_204355]-onset 
form of Pompe disease.  These patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_204356]

Inherited Disease ).  Patients presenting with this typi[INVESTIGATOR_204358] ‘classical’ infantile-onset Pompe disease.  A subset of patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease that survive be yond 1 year has been described by [CONTACT_204394] ( Slonim, 2000, J Pediatr ).  The clinical course of disease in these patients is 
characterized by a slower progression of card iomyopathy and longer survival, with patients 
generally developi[INVESTIGATOR_204359] 1 and 2 years of  age.  Although some patients 
die before 1 year of age, others may survive beyond 2 years. 
The late-onset form of Pompe disease progresses less rapi[INVESTIGATOR_204360]-onset form.  
Symptoms appear during childhood or as late as th e sixth decade of life.  Patients present with

progression of skeletal and resp iratory muscle involvement ( Laforêt, 2000, Neurology ).  
Eventually, most patients become wheelchair-bound, require ve ntilator support and ultimately 
succumb to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] ( Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today ; Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic 
and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease ). 
Genzyme Corporation has been involved in deve lopment of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) 
for the treatment of Pompe disease since 1998.  Initially, the clinical development program 
focused primarily on demonstration of safety and efficacy in patients with the infantile-onset 
form of Pompe disease.  Based on the finding s of the clinical trials, Myozyme received 
marketing approval in the [LOCATION_002] (US) , European Union (EU) and Canada in 2006 for 
long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease while research to 
establish the benefit of alglucosidase alfa in  late-onset Pompe disease continued.  Lumizyme 
received marketing approval in the United Stat es (US) in 2010 for use in late-onset Pompe 
disease patients 8 years of age and older. In  2014, the indication was expanded for Lumizyme to 
include all patients with a conf irmed diagnosis of Pompe disease, irrespective of age or 
phenotype. The recommended dosage regimen of alglucosidase alfa is 20 mg/kg of body weight administered once every 2 weeks as an intravenou s solution.  A brief overview of results of ERT 
in Pompe disease is provided below. 
In the infantile-onset patients, alglucosidase alfa markedly extended survival as compared to an 
untreated historical cohort ( Kishnani, 2007, Neurology ).  ERT with alglucosidase alfa also 
reversed indices of cardiomyopathy and improved cardiac function in the vast majority of 
patients.  Moreover, cons istent gains in motor function were observed, with a subset of patients 
achieving independent ambulation.  These findings contrast sharply to th e severe and unremitting 
clinical deterioration observed in virtually all untreated patie nts with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease ( van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics ). 
In patients with late-onset Pompe disease, alglucosidase alfa was associated with maintenance or 
improvements in pulmonary func tion, muscle strength, gross motor function, and functional 
status/disability.  In a study of 5 pediatric patients with late-onset Pompe disease, improvement in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) and Six Minute  Walk Test (6MWT) resu lts were observed after 
[ADDRESS_243935] reported major clinical improvements in a patient after years rather than weeks of treatment (Winkel, 2004, Ann Neurol ).  Given the severity of illness in these patients and the progressive

patients could represent clinical stabilization of  the disease by [CONTACT_204395]. 
4.1 Summary of Potential Risks 
Identified safety risks of alglucosidase alfa treat ment include development of infusion-associated 
reactions (IARs) including hypersensitivity a nd life-threatening anaphylactic shock and/or 
cardiac arrest; immune-mediated reactions, immunologic response and acute cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_204364].  Patients in this study will be closely monitored for IARs 
and other adverse reactions.  As with all ongoing  clinical studies of alglucosidase alfa, an 
independent Data Safety Monito ring Board (DSMB) appointed by [CONTACT_204396] A llergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB) appointed 
by [CONTACT_204397], when necessary, to review information and provide treatment recomm endations for IARs.   
For further details concerning warnings, precau tions, and contraindications, the Investigator 
should refer to the appropriate section of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
4.2 Summary of Potential Benefits 
Alglucosidase alfa is a lysosomal glycogen-specific enzyme indicated for patients with Pompe 
disease (GAA deficiency) and is an element of the standard of care.  Enzyme replacement 
therapy with alglucosidase alfa has shown positiv e effects on survival, invasive ventilator-free 
survival, and motor development in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease.   
The treatment administered and assessments performed during this study are not expected to 
provide a direct benefit to the individual patient beyond the sta ndard of care, other than to 
evaluate the long-term growth and development outcomes in patients with infantile-onset Pompe 
disease who are receiving ERT with alglucosidas e alfa. The data obtained in this study are 
expected to benefit the populati on of patients with Pompe diseas e as a whole through collection 
of long-term safety data. 
 
5. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The overall objective is to evaluate long-term growth and development of patients with infantile-
onset Pompe disease who begin treatment with algluc osidase alfa before [ADDRESS_243936] of alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated.  For research 
purposes only, cross-reacting immunologic material  (CRIM) status and GAA mutation analysis

The patient’s legal guardian(s) must sign the in formed consent form prior to performance of any 
of the study assessments outlined in Table 9-[ADDRESS_243938] (DSMB) will review safety information on an ad 
hoc basis as outlined in the DSMB Charter, which is maintained separately from the study 
protocol. 
An independent Allergic Reaction Review Board (ARRB) will be consulted on an ad hoc basis 
as outlined in the ARRB Charter, which is also maintained separately from this protocol. 
Efficacy will be evaluated in terms of physical growth, as measured by [CONTACT_204398]/height, weight and head circumference; motor development and function, as measured by 
[CONTACT_204399] (Bayley-
III) (up to 42 months of age), Gross Motor F unction Measure (GMFM-88) and Pompe Pediatric 
Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI); and cognitive development, as measured by

International Performance Scale – Revised (Leiter-R) and/or the change in the Nonverbal IQ 
score of the Leiter International Performance Scale – 3
rd Edition (Leiter-3)  (starting at the final 
assessment of the Bayley-III before 42 months of ag e).  As an exploratory objective, the effect of 
alglucosidase alfa treatment on urinary oligosaccharides (Hex4) will be evaluated.  For research 
purposes only, cross-reacting immunologic materi al (CRIM) status and GAA mutation will be 
evaluated. 
For patients treated with alglucosidase alfa prio r to age 1 (prior to study entry), available 
retrospective growth and development data will be collected.  Parameters for retrospective data 
collection will include available standard-of-care growth (height, weight, head circumference) and motor milestone information (e .g. head support, sitting, standing, and walking ability) from 
the time of treatment initiation. 
Safety will be evaluated in terms of AE monitoring, laboratory tests (clinical chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), anti-rhGAA antibody (IgG) formation, neuroimaging (at the 
discretion of the Investigator), vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and

report form (CRF) describing the reason for discontinuation. 
In the event that a patient dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent 
form) from the patient’s legal guardian(s) for a res earch autopsy or post-mortem research biopsy.  
Samples collected from this procedure will be used for research purposes only and data will not 
be provided to the Investigator or be included in any study analyses.  Refer to the Study Manual 
(SM) for research autopsy and post-mortem research biopsy procedural guidelines. 
A patient's participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  The following may be justifiable r easons for the Investigator to remove a patient 
from the study: 
• The patient and/or patient’s le gal guardian(s) is uncooperative, including failure to appear 
at study visits. 
• The patient was erroneously included in the study. 
• The patient develops an exclusion cr iterion or suffers an unmanageable AE. 
• The study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034]. 
• The patient and/or patient’s legal guardian(s) refuses algl ucosidase alfa administration. 
• Participation in an investigational study without the prio r authorization of Genzyme. 
To facilitate long-term data co llection, patients will be  encouraged to enroll in the Pompe 
Disease Registry via their treating physicia n after study completion or discontinuation. 
7.4 Study or Site Termination 
If the Sponsor, an Investigator, a clinical monitor, or national regulatory authority official 
discover conditions during the study that indicate the study or a study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after a ppropriate consultation between the Sponsor, the Investigator, the 
clinical monitor, and the DSMB, as appropriate.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the 
study or a study site include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or una cceptable risk to patients enrolled in the 
study. 
• The decision on the part of Genzyme Corporation to end the study. 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with pertinent regulatory authorities. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the research facility to the Sponsor, the 
clinical monitor, or regulatory authorities. 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  AMENDMENT 7 FINAL :  02 DECEMBER 2014 8. TREATMENTS 
 
8.1 Treatments Administered 
Alglucosidase alfa will be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight as prescribed by [CONTACT_204403] 2 weeks as an intravenous infusi on.  If clinically fe asible, all patients will 
continue at the same dose throughout the study.   Any modification to the dose and/or frequency 
of dosing is not permitted unless it is due to disease progression or to an AE, in which case it is not a protocol deviation, but the Investigator mu st consult with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
and Global Safety Officer in the event of a dose change.  The dosing change and the reasons for 
it will be documented on the appropriate CRFs. 
It is recommended that the reconstitution and administration instructions in the current 
prescribing information be followed. 
Patients who meet specific criteria may have th e option for home infusions.  Because of the 
possibility of anaphylactic reactions, personnel competent in recognizing and treating adverse 
reactions (including anaphylactic reactions) should be readily available throughout the home 
infusion.  The following criteria must be documented in the patient’s medical record: 
o The patient must be clinically stable with no history of moderate or severe IARs within [ADDRESS_243942] the patient’s ability to tolerate infusion. 
o The home infusion agency staff must be traine d by [CONTACT_204404].  Any new staff member must be trained by [CONTACT_204405]. 
o The home infusion agency staff must have access to and be trained on proper safety 
equipment, including but not limited to cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment. 
o If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity/anaphyla ctic reactions occur, the Investigator should 
assess whether or not it is safe  for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion. 
Genzyme should be notified about all IARs and consulted (as needed) if the patient 
experiences IARs suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions (refer to Section 9.5.2). 
o Home Infusion Agency must keep source documentation of the infusion, including 
documentation of any AEs.  Home Infusion Agency must be amenable to providing 
specific source documentation to Genzyme and agree to be monitored.  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_204365]’s safety even when 
delegating infusion responsibilities to the home care company. 
The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for approving a patient’s initiation with home 
infusions and is ultimately responsible for the safe ty of the patient during this clinical study.  
Refer to SM and Home Infusion Manual for further details regarding home infusions.

9.2.2 Cognitive Function and Motor Development Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) 
The Bayley-III ( Bayley, 2005, Bayley Scales of Infant and T oddler Development, Third Edition ) 
will be administered by a trained clinician to assess cognitive language and motor development.  
The Bayley-III consists of three administered scales (cognitive, language and motor) with 5 
subtests (cognitive, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor and gross motor).  The Cognitive Scale assesses how a child thinks, respo nds and learns about the world.  The Language 
Scale assesses how well a child can communicat e using gestures, sounds and words in the 
Expressive Communication subscale, and how well a child recognizes sounds and understands instructions and spoken language in the Recep tive Communication subscal e.  The Motor Scale 
assesses how well a child can use his or her hands and fingers to perform activities in the Fine Motor subscale, and how well a child can move his or her body in the Gross Motor subscale.  Normative data is available for the Bayley-III from 1 month to 42 months of age and was derived 
from a sample of US infants and children in 2004.  Data was also collected from 668 children 
with specific clinical diagnoses, including Do wn syndrome, prematurity, cerebral palsy, 
language impairment, pervasive developmental diso rder and fetal alcohol exposure.  Raw scores, 
scaled scores, and composite scores with percentile rank and confidence intervals will be reported for each of the three administered scales  for patients from 1 month to 42 months of age.

updated Leiter-3 Scale ( Roid, 2013, Leiter International Pe rformance Scale- 3
rd Edition (Leiter 
3)) will be administered by a trained clinician to assess intellectual ability.  The Leiter Scale was 
designed as a nonverbal measure of intellectual function, memory and atte ntion for individuals 
who could not be validly assessed with standard in telligence tests.  Special populations for whom 
the Leiter Scale was intended include those with communication disorders, hearing impairments, 
motor impairments, and certain types of learning disabilities.  
The Leiter-R Scale consists of two groups of subtests, the Visualization and Reasoning Battery 
(VR Battery) and the Attention and Memory Battery (AM Battery).  Four subtests of the VR 
Battery have been assembled into a Brief Scale IQ test for the estimation of intellectual ability.  The subtests in the Leiter-R are Figure Ground, Form Completion, Sequential Order and 
Repeated Patterns. The Brief Scale IQ test will be administered in this study to estimate global 
intellectual ability.  Raw and scaled scores will be reported for each of the administered subtests in addition to the Brief Scale IQ Composite score.   
The Leiter-3, published in 2013, is an updated version of the Leiter-R.  The Leiter-3 consists of 
two groups of subtests, the Cognitive Battery an d the Attention/Memory Battery.  Nonverbal 
Intelligence will be used in this study to estimate global intellectual ability.  The first four 
subtests of the Cognitive Battery are compi[INVESTIGATOR_204372]. These subtests 
are: Figure Ground, Form Completion, Sequential Orde r, and Classification-Analogies.  The fifth 
subtest (Visual Patterns) is an optional subtest, which may be administered if one of the four subtests is compromised.  Raw and scaled scores will be reported for each administered subtest 
in addition to the Nonverbal IQ Composite score. 
All clinicians administering the Leiter-R and /or the Leiter-3 will be provided with a training 
video and instruction manual.  The Leiter-R and/or the Leiter-[ADDRESS_243953] been performed using

The GMFM-88 consists of 88 items  organized into 5 dimensions: 
o lying and rolling 
o sitting

o standing 
o walking, running and jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_204373] 5 years. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = cannot do; 1 = initiates [< 10% of the 
task]; 2 = partially completes [10 to < 100 % of the task]; 3 = task completion).  The score for 
each dimension is expressed as a percentage of the maximum score for that dimension.  The total 
score is obtained by [CONTACT_204409].  Therefore, each d imension contributes equall y to the total score.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pompe Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (Pompe PEDI) 
A disease-specific version of the PEDI was developed to assess functional capabilities and 
performance in children with Pompe diseas e from 2 months through adolescence ( Haley, 2005, 
Dev Med Child Neurol ; Haley, 2004, Pediatr Neurol ; Haley, 2003, Pediatr Rehabil;  Haley, 
2003, Dev Med Child Neurol ).  All patients will be administered the Pompe PEDI, regardless of 
age.  The Pompe PEDI includes all items from the original PEDI, as well as additional items in the Functional Skills Mobility and Self-Care domains to reflect clinically relevant functional 
skills for children with Pompe disease.  Norm-based scoring was developed for these new items 
and scoring algorithms for the PEDI have been adjusted to reflect the additional normative data collected for the Pompe PEDI.  A trained clinician will administer the Pompe PEDI with input

9.2.3 Urinary Oligosaccharid e (Hex4) Levels 
As an exploratory measure, collection of urine for oligosaccharide levels will be performed at the times specified in Table 9-1 .  A tetraglucose oligomer, Glc α1-6Glcα1-4Glcα1-4Glc, designated 
Glc4 (Hex4), has been shown to be elevated in the urine ( Hallgren, 1974, Eur J Clin Invest ; 
Chester, 1983, Lancet ; Peelen, 1994, Clin Chem ; An, 2000, Anal Biochem ; An, 2005, Mol Genet 
Metab ) in patients with Pompe disease.  Hence determination of Hex4 may be a means by [CONTACT_204410].  HPLC-UV ( An, 2000, Anal Biochem ) and stable 
isotope dilution ESI-MS/MS ( Young, 2003, Anal Biochem ) are two different methods available 
for the analysis of Hex4 in bi ological fluids as the butyl-p-a minobenzoate (BAB) derivative.  
Oligosaccharide levels in urine will be measured by a central laboratory, and additional 
information for the collection and handling of these samples can be found in the SM.

will be conducted according to standard procedures  (specified in the SM) at the times specified 
in Table 9-1  in order to evaluate possible changes in brain structures over time. 
If clinically significant changes in neuroimaging findings as compared to Baseline results are 
noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE CRF.  Clinical significance is defined 
as any variation in neuroimaging findings that  has medical relevance and may result in an 
alteration in medical care.  The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the 
parameter returns to Baseline or until the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer 
medically necessary. 
9.3.2 Hearing Testing 
Hearing loss has been reported in patients with glycogen storage disorders ( Galton, 1976, Acta 
Paediatr Scand ; Jurecka, 1985, Arch Dermatol ).  Furthermore, cochlear involvement has been 
demonstrated in a mouse model of Pompe dis ease, and hearing loss found in patients with 
infantile-onset Pompe disease ( Kamphoven, 2004, Neurobiol Dis). 
Hearing will be assessed at the times specified in Table 9-[ADDRESS_243960] of commonly

Investigators should use their clinical judgment wh en considering clinical significance.  Clinical 
significance is defined as any variation in la boratory parameters, which has medical relevance 
and may result in an alteration in medical care.   If CS laboratory changes from Baseline are 
noted, the changes will be documented on the AE CRF.  The Investigator will also assess the 
relationship of all clinically sign ificant out of range values to alglucosidase alfa as being not 
related, remote/unlikely, possible, probable, or definite.  The Investigator will continue to 
monitor the patient with additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached normal 
range and/or Baseline, or, (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, out of range values are not 
related to the administration of alglucosidase alfa or other protocol -specific procedures. 
9.3.6 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] , and temperature) will be recorded at 
baseline, prior to the start of each infusion, at the end of each infusion, and if the patient experiences an IAR, as specified in Table 9-1 .  All IARs should be captured on the SAE/IAR

9.5 Adverse Events 
AEs will be assessed at screening/baseline.  At every infusion visit the patient’s legal guardian(s) 
will be asked “Since your last questioning or visit, has the patient experienced any health 
problems?” 
An AE is defined as any undesirable physical, psychological or behavioral effect experienced by 
a patient or subject during their pa rticipation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the 
use of the drug or biologic, whether or not produc t-related.  This includes any untoward signs or 
symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_204416]. 
AEs may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by [CONTACT_204417]/or 
observed by [CONTACT_204418] 
• Findings at physical examinations 
• Laboratory abnormalities of clinical significance 
Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnor malities already existing prior to the use of the 
product (i.e., prior to participation in the AGLU03606 study) are not
 considered AEs after 
treatment unless  they recur after the patient has rec overed from the preexisting condition or in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_204377] a clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or 
frequency.

If clinically significant worsening from Baseline is noted, the changes will be documented as 
AEs on the AE CRF.  Clinical significance is defi ned as any variation in signs, symptoms, or 
testing that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care.  The 
Investigator will continue to monitor the patient until the parameter returns to Baseline or until 
the Investigator determines that follow-up is no longer medically necessary. 
9.5.1 Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• Life-threatening experience 
• Required or prolonged in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Congenital anomaly 
• Important medical events that may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Life-threatening experience : Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e., does not include an AE that had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity:  Any AE that resulted in a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to  conduct normal life functions. 
Important medical events  that may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above: AEs that 
may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73608], based upon appropr iate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient 
or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the adverse drug/biologic experience 
using the following categories: Mild, Moderate, and Severe.  This assessment is subjective and 
the Investigator should use medical judgment to compare the reported AE to similar type events 
observed in clinical practice.  Below are listed guidelines for severity assessment: 
• Mild: Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject/patient or does not make the 
subject/patient uncomfortable.  The AE does not influence performance or functioning.  
Prescription drugs are not ordinarily  needed for relief of symptom(s).

Performance of daily activities is influenced.  Treatment of symptom(s) may be needed. 
• Severe: Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to cause the subject/patient severe discomfort.  
Severity may cause cessation of treatment with the study drug.  Treatment for symptom(s) 
may be given. 
Severity is not equivalent to seriousness. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Autopsy and Post-Mortem Biopsy 
In the event that a patient dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent 
form) from the patient’s legal guardian(s) for a res earch autopsy or post-mortem research biopsy.  
If consented, samples collected from this procedure will be sent to Genzyme Corporation and 
used for research purposes only; data will not be provided to the Investigator or be included in 
any analyses.  Refer to the SM for research autopsy and post-mortem research biopsy procedural 
guidelines.

Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs th at occur during the infusion or within up to 24 
hours after the start of infusion a nd are considered as related or possibly related to the ERT by 
[CONTACT_29539]. An event occurring ≥ 24 hours after the start of an infusion may 
be judged an IAR if a delayed reaction is consider ed possible by [CONTACT_29539].  
These events should be reported to Global Phar macovigilance and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_204378] 24 hours 
of the Investigator’s first knowle dge of the event.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional testing 
in the event a patient experiences a moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR.  Suggested guidelines for 
the management of IARs are summarized in the cu rrent version of the Investigator’s Brochure. 
9.5.3 Adverse Experience and Serious Adverse Experience Reporting 
The necessity and time requirements for reporting of AEs to Genzyme or designee and/or 
regulatory agencies are as follows:

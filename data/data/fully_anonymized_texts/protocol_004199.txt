Version 8  February 6, 2019 – updated Co-I Dec. [ADDRESS_1053994] of high -dose 
riboflavin supplementation on chronic plaque psoriasis. Up to fifty  volunteers with chronic 
plaque psoriasis will be recruited for a double-blind, placebo-controlled 28 week prospective 
study with cross-over of both the intervention and control groups at the 12 week time mark. There will be a 4 week washout period when subjects crossover. Riboflavin will be dosed 400 mg by [CONTACT_768425]. Throughout the study we will perform both clinical and laboratory assessments to measure response. Clinical assessment will include the Psoriasis- Area -and-Severity -Index (PASI), Physician Global Assessment (PGA) , 
Dermatology - Life-Quality -Index ( DLQI ) and pruritus  assessment will be performed at all 
clinical evaluations. Photographs of volunteers’ skin will be taken. Skin punch biopsies of psoriasis plaques and uninvolved skin will be performed at pre- determined time points 
throughout the study to measure metabolomics and RNA profiling as well as histologic markers. Patients will also have regular blood draws to follow plasma measurements of riboflavin and Flavin -adenine-dinucleotide ( FAD ). 
 The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of riboflavin as compared to placebo at achieving a PASI 50 response (a 50% or greater improvement in PASI from baseline). Secondary objectives include, measuring the efficacy of the intervention at achieving a PGA, DLQI, or pruritus assessment score of 0/1 . All statistics will be performed  on a 
modified intent- to-treat population.   
 
2 BACKGROUND  
 Psoriasis is a chronic immune -mediated skin disorder characterized by [CONTACT_768426][INVESTIGATOR_768418] . Characteristic lesions are well -demarcated , symmetrically distributed red  
plaques with silvery  scale. In the [LOCATION_002], the  prevalence of psoriasis is estimated to be 
2% and it affects over [ADDRESS_1053995] from productivity and health- related quality of life losses.
2 There is no cure for psoriasis and 
treatment is directed at controlling patients’ symptoms. Current treatment options consist of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], phototherapy, topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] D3 (or calcipotriol ), methotrexat e, and newer 
biologic agents.   Amongst patients with skin disease, there is significant interest in using complementary alternative medicine and vitamins  to treat their disease.
[ADDRESS_1053996] shown topi[INVESTIGATOR_768419] a Class V 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_768420].
4-6 This efficacy and safety  led the 
United S tates Food and Drug Administration to approve calcipotriol ointment for psoriasis 
treatment in 1993 and since that time it has been  an important part of psoriasis treatment.

Version 8  February 6, 2019 – updated Co-I Dec. [ADDRESS_1053997] in vitamin treatments and the proven efficacy  of vitamin treatment for 
psoriasis we were intrigued when our laboratory work uncovered a significant decrease in riboflavin levels in psoriasis plaques.  While  measuring the metabolic profile of psoriasis 
plaques as compared to skin from healthy volunteers, we measured  400 fold less  riboflavin 
in psoriatic plaques (Gudjonsson, unpublished findings).  Furthermore, exploring predicted drug targets using recent Genome- Wide- Association -Studies (GWAS) in psoriasis, two risk 
loci ( ACOX1  and NOS2 ) are targets of flavin -adenine- dinucleotide (FAD) a metabolite of 
riboflavin.  R eviewing the medical literature, we found  a number of case series from fifty to 
sixty years ago reporting improvement of psoriasis after riboflavin treatment.
7-[ADDRESS_1053998] in exploring the use of this 
vitamin  to treat psoriasis . 
 Riboflavin, commonly known as Vitamin B2, is a water -soluble vitamin found in all living 
cells as mono - or dinucleotides. It is part of the Flavin family of compounds, and is the 
necessary precursor of the biologically important fl avin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and 
flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
[ADDRESS_1053999] published a case series  of 148 psoriasis patients he had 
injected  with  5-10 mg of riboflavin intramuscularly once weekly  and then followed 
clinically . Of those 148 patients, 24% had complete remission (“healed”) , and 68% had at 
least a 50% improvement.  Only 7% of the patients failed to respond or had less than a 50% improvement. Maynard also sent surveys to 156 of his psoriasis patients that  he had treated 
with riboflavin but whom he had not seen in clinic for two years. He  received 50 survey 
cards back  and, of those cards, 82% of patients reported they had “ healed,” “improved with 
no relapse,” or “ improved with partial relapse. ” Only 18% of responders felt their  disease 
was the same as before riboflavin treatment.
[ADDRESS_1054000]’s work was soon followed by [CONTACT_768427]. In 1952, Sul zberger 
and Baer published their observations that riboflavin [ADDRESS_1054001]. Herbert Luscombe published a case series 
demonstrating that weekly intramuscular injections of 50 mg of riboflavin for 4 to 16 weeks “improved” or “markedly improved” [ADDRESS_1054002] , in 1957, Drs. Welsh and Ede published a large case series of 348 psoriasis patients 
they treated with ribo flavin and concluded “moderate and/or massive dosages” of riboflavin

Version 8  February 6, 2019 – updated Co-I Dec. [ADDRESS_1054003] and so found no benefit to the intervention. Interestingly, the blinded placebo in this randomized controlled trial was riboflavin 25 mg by [CONTACT_34048] , so the authors wondered if even this low dose of riboflavin was biologica lly 
active.  This trial was stopped prematurely , because interim analysis demonstrated the 
intervention would not show a statistically significant result. The authors were unable to conclude whether the results with the lower-dose of riboflavin (the “placebo group”) were an active effect or a placebo effect.
15 
 Riboflavin was well tolerated by [CONTACT_768428]. Only t wo publications 
included data on adverse outcomes associated with riboflavin and within these trials there were five adverse events  out of the 51 patients administered riboflavin. Adverse events 
included diarrhea (2 subjects), upper abdomina l pain, facial erythema and polyuria.
13,[ADDRESS_1054004] that riboflavin is clinically effective for the treatment of psoriasis ; however, they were not 
conclusive. More recent human trials have shown that 400 mg of daily oral riboflavin is a 
safe and well -tolerated medication to administer to humans. Our lab oratory data, the 
published case reports of riboflavin’s effectiveness and its safety led  us to propose these 
clinical and laboratory experiments to better determine riboflavin’s effects on  psoriasis.

 3 OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Primary endpoint  
The number of subjects that achieve a 50 percent or greater reduction in thei r PASI with 
intervention as compared to placebo. 
 
3.2 Secondary endpoints  
• The number of subjects that  achieve a PASI 75, 90, 100 response with 
intervention as compared to placebo.  
• The number of subjects t hat achieve a PGA score of 0/1 with intervention as 
compared to placebo. 
• The number of subjects that  report a pru ritus score of 0/1 with intervention 
as compared to placebo . 
• The number of subjects treated that  report a DLQI score of 0/1 with 
intervention as compared to placebo . 
• The difference in serum plasma levels of ri boflavin and FAD in subjects 
treated with intervention as compared to placebo.  
 
4 STUDY DESIGN   
 
A 28- week , double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective study with cross-over of both the 
riboflavin and placebo groups at the 12- week  time mark.   
 Patients will take either 400 mg of riboflavin (“B2 -400”) or a placebo by [CONTACT_31943] a day 
for [ADDRESS_1054005] with this dose. While data suggesting equivalent activity of riboflavin at a lower dose is intriguing, we feel it is premature to choose a lower dose based off the findings in one trial that was stopped prematurely.
15 
 Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled. Six  skin biopsies will be performed to m easure 
metabolomics profiles , and there will be five blood draws to measure serologic markers.

8 RISK AND RISK MITIGATION 
 
Title:  The Effect of Riboflavin on Moderate to Severe Plaque Type Psoriasis  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_768417], MD  
 
Version 8  February 6, 2019 – updated Co-I Dec. 2019 
 
 The ri sks to subjects in this study are minimal, as riboflavin is a common over-the-counter 
supplement and the dose in this study has been wel l tolerated in previous studies ( see 
Background I nformation ). Side effects of diarrhea and polyuria have been reported, but these 
resolved promptly with discontinuation of riboflavin. There have been no reported deaths. 
Riboflavin toxicity is unlikely and also reversed promptly by [CONTACT_768432].   At study visits and the close- out telephone call, all subjects will be screened for adverse events . 
Any reported events will be recorded on a standardized form, similar to the example included in Appendix E – Adverse Events LOG . Basic labs will be drawn throughout the study, CBC and 
CMP, to monitor for potential toxicity to subjects’  bone marrow, liver and kidneys. Pregnancy 
tests will be administered at each office visit to women of childbearing potential. As this dose of riboflavin has not been studied in pregnant women, any woman who becomes pregnant during the study will be discontinued.  Serious adverse events will be reported according to the UM IRB protocol in an expedited manner. These events include any untoward medical occurrence that results in: death, life threatening illness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent disability/incapacity, pregn ancy, congenital 
anomaly/birth defect, an important medical event as deemed by [CONTACT_30967]. Study investigators and staff will work together in this reporting. 
9 DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
 Study administrators, [CONTACT_768436] and Jennifer Bell, w ill communicate with UMHS 
Pharmacy and coordinate the delivery of investigational medications. All investigational medications will be stored and dispensed to study administrators by [CONTACT_768433] (UH B2D301), per protocol. These administrators will then hand subjects the investigational medication. At weeks [ADDRESS_1054013] the number of returned capsules in the subjects file.  
10 MONITORING PLAN  
A risk -based approach to monitoring will be used for this study. The study has been assigned a 
risk level of "minor increase over minimal risk" with the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRBMED) .  The study drug being used has a Generally Re cognized as Safe 
(GRAS) designation from FDA and the Select Committee on GRAS (SCOGS) concluded that there is no hazard to the public when it is used at levels currently recommended by [CONTACT_1622].  This is a non-complex study that involves otherwise healthy subjects who are to be seen in  an 
established and experienced research environment, with no electronic data capture using relatively safe study drug. For these reasons, the following monitoring plan will be implemented. 
An onsite, independent, trained and experienced internal monitor will be assigned to monitor the 
progress of the study.  The monitor will use existing standard departmental standards and guidelines in conducting the study review. The frequency of the review will be dependent on study activity , but will occur at least yearly. The first review will take place no more than [ADDRESS_1054014].

 Processes/documentation to be reviewed by [CONTACT_768434]:  
• Communication between site staff  IRBMED and subjects 
•  Verification of informed consent 
•  Adherence to protocol eligibility  criteria  
• Adherence to current documented protocol procedures 
• Source documentation accuracy  and completeness  
•  Procedures for documenting appropriate accountability and administration of the study 
drug 
• Review adverse event reporting 
 Monitor will provide written results of the review including enrollment status, a description of any noncompliance or data irregularities, and any required corrective actions for significant issues found.  Monitor wil l also confirm corrective actions were implemented and that reportable 
occurrences were reported to IRBMED. These reports will be submitted to IRBMED at the scheduled continuation review.  
[ADDRESS_1054015] size and a conservative amount of correlation between the measurements, a sample size of 22 subjects in each sequence yields a statistical power of 80%.    All clinical and laboratory assessments will be descriptively summarized at each visit (weeks 0, 2, 12, 16, 18, and 28) for the modified intent- to-treat population.  Continuous variables will be 
summarized with standard descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation and range. Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_7237] (N, %).   
 Differences within each sequence of treatment from  baseline to endpoint will be assessed using

Static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA)  
The sPGA  is used to determine a subject’s psoriasis lesions overall at a given time point. The 
sPGA score should be selected using the descriptors below that best describe the overall 
appearance of the lesions. It is not necessary that all three criteria be fulfil led.  In some subjects 
either scaling or erythema will dominate the clinical presentation.  In those cases, the sPGA score should be based on a combination of plaque elevation and the dominant feature (either erythema or scale). Since plaque elevation is t he most robust finding, it should be the dominant 
feature influencing the sPGA rating for those indeterminate cases.   
 
Score Category Category Description 
0 Clear Plaque elevation = 0 (no elevat ion over normal skin ) Scaling = 0 (no 
scale) 
Erythema = 0 (residual post- inflammato ry hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_136175] n or 
hypo pi[INVESTIGATOR_22765]) 
1 Minimal Plaque elevation = (possi ble but di fficult to ascert ain whethe r there is a slight 
elevat ion above normal skin) 
Scaling = (surface dry ness with some white coloration ) Erythema = up to 
moderate (up to definite red coloration) 
2 Mild Plaque elevation = slight (s light but definite elevat ion ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y edges a re indistinct 
or sloped) 
Scaling = fine (fine scale partially or mostly covering lesions ) Erythema = up to 
moderate (up to definite red coloration) 
3 Moderate Plaque elevation = moderate (mo derate elevation with rough o r sloped edges) 
Scaling = coarser (coarse scale covering most of all of the lesi ons) Erythema = moderate 
(definite red coloration) 
4 Seve re Plaque elevation = marked (marked elevation typi[INVESTIGATOR_768424]) 
Scaling = coarse (coarse, non-tenacious scale predominate s covering most or all 
of the lesions) 
Erythema = severe (very bright red co loration) 
5 Very Seve re Plaque elevation = very marked (ve ry marked elevation typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y with ha rd sharp 
edges) 
Scaling = very coarse (coarse, thick tenacious scale covering most o f all of the 
lesions; ro ugh surface) 
Erythema = very seve re (extreme red coloration; dusk y to d eep r ed coloration)

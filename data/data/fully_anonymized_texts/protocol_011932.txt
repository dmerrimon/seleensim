4.1 Background 
4.1.1 Adopt
ive Ce ll Th erapy (ACT) for Melanoma 
ACT using expanded TIL has shown great promise for the tr eatment of Sta ge IV mel anoma 
patients failing all other types of therapy [1-3]. A CT clinica l tria ls reported by [CONTACT_6812] 
(Bethe sda) using a lymphodeple ting pre-conditioning regimen b efore TIL and IL-[ADDRESS_389435] had c linical response (CR) rates of up to 51% [1-3]. A number of immun e-related 
mechanisms  account for this improved per sistence and be tter c linical re sponse [2, 4, 5]. The 
curre nt methodol ogy for A CT requires a two-pha se proce ss. The fir st phase involves the 
expansion of TIL, isolated from surgically- resected tumor fragme nts, ex vivo with IL-2 
in sm all scale over a per iod of 4-5 weeks [4, 6]. TIL c ultures from patients exhib iting 
a minima l rate of expansion are then expande d in l arge-sca le usin g a Rapid Expansion 
Protocol (RE P) in a GMP facility [6, 7]. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396]-REP TIL product for infusion consists 
of 25 to 150 billion  T-cells,  with increased numbers of infused CD8+ TIL cor relating to  better 
clinical response (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3A) . We have e stablish ed a comp rehensive and successful 
immunoth erapy prog ram at the M DACC  aimed at fur ther enhancing the e fficacy of A CT 
by [CONTACT_316558][INVESTIGATOR_316518] s. M DACC  is 
the largest center f or ACT of melanoma outside of the NCI. At present, we are conduc ting 
a Phase II clinical trial asse ssing  the e fficacy of A CT using expanded TIL ex vivo using 
the classical REP described above  toge ther w ith 
lymphodeple tion before TIL infusion [2, 3] . 
Since starting our program in 2006, we ha ve 
cultured mela noma  tumor fragments from 
over 600 pa tients w ith Stage IV melanoma 
and hav e su ccessfully expanded minim al 
number s of TIL (at least 4 x 107) needed for 
the large-scale R EP from approx imate ly 60% 
of pa tients. So far we have t reated over [ADDRESS_389436] progra m; 
these patients were refractory to all other therapie s. The c linical response rate in our A CT 
program so far has been very encoura ging (Table 1) w ith 45% of the [ADDRESS_389437]- infusion so far (32/71) exhibiting a c linica l response ( PR/CR)  according to RECI ST 
criteria after CT scans of target lesions starting at 6 weeks after treatment. Dura tion of 
responses has var ied w ith some pa tients achieving ye ars of c linical benef it (Table 1). 
Immunoco rrelative studies have revealed that CD8+ T-cells are cr itical in media ting anti- 
tumor re s
ponses and that higher number s of in fused CD8+ TIL correlates w ith greater objective  
tumor regression (Fig. 3A, and da ta not shown). 
Table 1: updated progre ssion  free and ov erall survival for 71 TIL tr eated pa tients as of 
Septe mber 2013. 
During 
REP anti-tumor CD8+ TIL not only gr eatly in crease in number, but a lso further 
differentiate and acquire more potent anti-tumor killing  func tion [7]. T his is needed for a nti- 
tumor CTL ac tivity, but is also associated w ith an acquisition  of a t erminally diff erentiate d 
CTL phenotype and a loss of effector-me mory (EM) CD8+ T-cells (CD27+CD28+) capable of 
long-term per sistence and expansion in the host after adoptive transfer [5, 7, 8]. Howe ver, 
maintenance of CD28 expre ssion  in particular has been shown to be critical for TIL to 
respond to further antigenic stimulation, long-term cell division and per sistence in vivo, as 
found by [CONTACT_316559] [5, 7, 9]. We have tr acked the 
persistence of sp ecific T IL clonotypes after A CT using T CR Vβ sequencing of isolate d 
PBMC post- infusion, a nd found that the per sistence for over 1 month of one or more ma jor

Our la
boratory has been activ ely  engaged in identifying biom arkers which correla te with 
clinical response in TIL t reated pa tients. We have found that pa tients who achieve response s 
to TIL tend to have higher absolute number s of TIL infused. Additionally, pa tients w ith 
highe r  proportions  of  CD8+  T  cells  in  their  infusion  produc t  also  tend  to  ha ve  better 
responses. An unexpected finding was that the nega tive co-stimula tory marker s PD-1, BT LA 
and TI M3 on infused TIL cor related w ith improved pa tient response s. Indeed, pa tient TI L 
with higher frequencies of BTLA + T cells seemed to have improved c linical res ponses [10] . 
Much work is re quired to va lidate the si gnifi cance of th ese potentia l biomarker s.

4.1.[ADDRESS_389439] on IL-2 Dosing i n Adoptive Ce ll Th erapy 
Use of high dose int ravenous IL-2 beginning approx imately 12 hours after TIL infusion ha s 
been utilized as a m echanism to promote  survival and enhanced e fficacy of t ransferred T 
cells [10-13]. Howe ver, HD-IL2 is associated wi th significant toxicities including g rade [ADDRESS_389440] with low doses of IL-2 [1, 14, 15] and w hile it 
seems  that be tter response rates are seen w ith the high dose reg imen, low dose IL- 2 
administered IV or SC has a lso produced durab le responses w ith much be tter tol erance to 
therapy. A groundbreaking study in 2002 treated pa tients w ith four infusions of autologous 
CD8+ T ce ll clones against MART1, Melan -A and gp100 tumor a ssociat ed antigens to 10 
patients w ith meta static melanoma. Very low doses of IL-2 were used (0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 x 
106 units/m2  twice da ily for the s econd, third and four th infusions, respectiv ely). The se 
autologous T cells were found to persist in vivo, localized to the tumor sites and led to 
clinical responses in eight of ten treated pa tients with responses seen for up to 21 months. 
This reg imen was very well tol erated and there were no AEs attributed to the a dministere d 
SC LD-IL2 [14]. 
In an e arly study pha se I study of adoptive ce ll therapy, pa tients w ith meta static melanoma 
were tr eated w ith non-myeloabla tive lymphodeple ting che moth erapy consisting of 
cyclophospha mide  and fludarabine and w ere then infused w ith in vitro expanded, tumor 
reactive  autologous T cell clones selected for high avidit y recognition  of melanoma antige ns. 
Ther e were three cohor ts of pa tients who then went on to receive e ither no int erleukin 2, low 
dose IL-2 (72,000 IU/kg IV th ree times a day to a max imum  of 15 doses) or high dose IL-2 
(720,000 IU /kg intravenously th ree times a da y for a max imum of 12 doses). Although there 
were no 
durable responses in this clinical tria l, this was thought to be more due to need f or 
additional manipulations of the t ransferred T cell popula tion as transient responses were seen 
in both the low dose a nd hi gh dose IL-2 treated pa tients [1]. 
In a more recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_316520]-2, six patients w ith meta static melanoma

Two of the six patients had ongoing comple te responses at the time of publi cation  (+10 and 
+30 months), 2 pa tients had stable dis ease of 4 and 5 month dura tion and two pa tients
progressed shortly after treatm ent. The median time to prog ression  was 8.2 months a nd
overall su rviva l was 12 months [15].

compared w ith mice receiving the control antibody (Figure 4A, B, C) [16]. 
Additionally, use of anti PD-1 antibod y in both MC38/gp100 and B16 tumor inoculated mice 
after adoptive transfer of T cells lead to statistically signifi cant shrinkage of tumor com pared 
to mice t reated w ith T cells or anti PD-1 antibody alone (Figure 4 D and E) w ith little evide nt

4.1.4 Anti PD-1 Antibody: P harmaceutical and Th erapeut ic Background 
The impo rtance of intact immune  surveillance in contr olling  outgrow th of neopla stic 
transforma tion has bee n known for de cades [17]. Accumula ting evidence shows a 
corre lation between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL s) in cancer tissue and favora ble 
prognosis in various malignancies [18-29]. In par ticular, the presence of CD8+ T- cells and 
the ratio of  CD8+ effector T- cells / FoxP3+ regula tory T- cells s eems  to corre late with 
improved prognosis and long-ter m su rviva l in many solid tumo rs.

T-cells under hea lthy conditions, is to down-modula te unwa nted or ex cessive  immune
response s, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig
superfa mily me mber related to CD28 and CT LA-4 which has been shown to nega tively
regula te antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L 2)
[30, 31]. The structure of murine PD-1 has b een resolved [32]. PD-1 and fa mily me mbers ar e
type I t ransme mbrane glycoproteins conta ining  an Ig Variable-type (V-type) doma in
responsible for ligand binding and a cytopla smic  tail which is responsible for the binding of
signaling m
olecules. The cytopla smic  tail of PD-1 conta ins 2 tyrosine-base d signaling motifs,
an immuno receptor tyros ine-based inhibition motif (ITI M) and an immuno receptor tyrosine- 
based sw itch motif  (ITSM). Following T cell stimula tion, PD-1 recruits the tyrosin e
phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to the IT SM motif  within its cytopla smic  tail, leading to the
dephosphoryla tion of ef fector mol ecules such as CD3ζ, PK Cθ and ZAP70 which ar e involved
in the CD3 T cell signaling cascade [31, 33-35]. The m echanism by [CONTACT_13209]- [ADDRESS_389446] from that of CTLA-4 as both
molecules regula te an over lappin g set of signaling proteins [36]. PD-1 was shown to be
expre ssed on ac tivated lymphocytes including per ipheral CD4+ and CD8+ T- cells,  B ce lls, T
regs and Natural Killer cells [37, 38].Expre ssion has a lso been shown during thy mic
development on CD4-CD8- (double nega tive) T- cells as we ll as subse ts of m acrophages and
dendr itic cells [39]. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and PD-L2) are c onstitutiv ely expre ssed or
can be indu ced in a var iety of cell type s, including non-hematopoie tic tissues as well as in
various tumo rs [40-43]. Both ligands are ty pe I transme mbrane recept ors containing both
IgV- and IgC- like domains in the ext racellular region and conta in short cytopla smic  regions
with no known signa ling motif s. Binding of ei ther PD-[ADDRESS_389447] notably on vascular endothe lium,  wher eas PD-L2 prote in is
only det ectably expre ssed on antigen-pre senting cells found in lymphoid tissue  or chronic
inflamma tory environments. PD-L2 is thought to contr ol immune  T cell activ ation in
lymphoid organs, whe reas PD-L1 s erves to dampen unwa rranted T cell func tion in peripheral
tissues [43]. Although hea lthy organs expre ss little ( if any) PD-L1, a var iety of cancers wer e
demonst rated to expre ss abundant leve ls of this T cell inhibito r. PD-1 has been su ggested to
regula te tumo r-specific T-cell expansion in subj ects with mela noma. This suggests that the
PD-1/PD-L1 pa thway plays a critical role in tumor immune  eva sion and should be
considered a s an attractive targe t for th erape utic intervention.
A recent study of TIL from fresh melanoma tumo rs showe d that expre ssion  of inhibi tory 
receptors including PD-1 on CD8+ TIL identified and sel ected for a diver se repertoire of 
autologous tumo r-reactive  cells. Additionally TCR deep sequencing showed that the most 
highly expanded clonotypes were the ones which had the a bility to recognize autologous 
tumo r. The se data sugge st that PD-1 identifies clonally expanded CD8+ tumo r-reactive 
populations and sugge sts that expre ssion  of PD-1 on CD8+ TIL could func tion as a potentia l 
predictive biom arker of response to checkpoint inhibition [44]. 
MK-3475 (pre viously known as SCH  900475) is a potent and highly sel ective  humanize d 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between PD-1 a nd its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2.

4.2.1 Rationale for Dose Sele ction/Regimen 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interle uk
in-2 (A ldesleukin, Prole ukin)  
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) w ill be manuf actured and supplied b y Prome theus and w ill be pu rchased 
by [CONTACT_941] M.D. Ander son phar macy from comme rcial sources.  IL-2 is a 133 a mino  acid-long 
peptide pr imarily secreted by T- cells in response to various a ntigenic stimuli.  The cytokine 
acts through a specific IL-2 receptor consisting of α, β, γ subunits. In addition to T-cell 
proli feration, IL-2 l eads to activ ation and pr oliferation of na tural killer (NK) cells,  increasing 
their tumo ricidal activi ty. O ther actions  of IL-2 include augmenta tion of B-ce ll grow th and 
immuno globulin production, enhancement of int erferon (IF N)-γ and tumor necr osis factor 
(TNF)-β produc tion from T -cells,  IL-6 produc tion by [CONTACT_245156] s, modula tion of histamine 
release by [CONTACT_242822], and upregula tion of IL-2 r eceptor s. This tr igger s the release of various 
other cytokine s leading to the tota l immun e/ inflammatory reaction and re sulta nt toxicity. 
In this study, there w ill be two arms of pa tients that differ based on the dosa ge of IL-[ADDRESS_389451] demonstrat ed

to induce cellular immunolog ic effects in vivo while doses gr eater than 106 U/m2 were 
associated w ith systemic symptoms  of mala ise and myalgia s. Following subcutaneous (s.c .) 
administra tion, IL-2 ex hibits  a half- life of bet ween 3 to 12 hour s, sustained serum leve ls of 
10- 25 U /ml, and receptor sa turating serum concent rations of 22 pM after an injection  of

treatme nt of mel anoma re sults in response rate s of 0 to 9% [49]. Ther efore, patients receiving
low-dose IL-2 in this tria l, (2 million IU SC d aily x 14 days), are u nlikely to receive
significant benef it from the IL-2 alone, ra ther, the IL-2 is administered in a manner designe d
to promote per sistence of infused T cells in vivo. Pa tients treated w ith low dose IL-2 do not
exper ience signifi cant toxicity [50-52] and it is rare to have CTCAE g rade 3-[ADDRESS_389454] to what is expected w ith patients treated w ith high do se IL-2.
[IP_ADDRESS] Fluda rabine  
Fludarabine phospha te is a fluor inated nucleotide analog of the antivi ral agent vidarabine, 9- 
β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) that is relatively resistant to deamin ation. Fludara bine is  
a purine antagonist an timetabolite. Fludarabine phospha te is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_267107] 2-
fluoro-a ra-A and then phosphorylated int racellul arly by [CONTACT_316563], 2-fluoro-a ra-ATP. This meta bolite  appear s to act by [CONTACT_316564], r ibonucleotide reductase and DNA pr imase, thus inhibiting DNA 
synthe sis. The mechani sm of ac tion of this antimeta bolite  is not completely char acterize d 
and may be multi-fa ceted . 
Fludarabine w ill be purchased by [CONTACT_941] M.D. And erson pharmacy from co mmercial source s. 
Fludarabine is supplied as a fludarabine phospha te powder in the form of a white, lyophilize d 
solid  cake. The f ludarabine powder is stable for at l east 18 months at 2 – 8 deg rees C; when 
reconstituted, fluda rabine is stable for at lea st 16 days at room temp erature. Specialized 
references should be consulted for specific compa tibili ty information. Fluda rabine is 
dephosphorylated in serum, t ransported int racellularly and conver ted to the nucle otide 
fludarabine triphosphate; this 2-fluoro-ara- ATP mol ecule is thought to be required for the 
drug’s 
cytotoxic effects. Fludarabine inhibits  DNA polym erase, ribonucleotide reductas e,

[IP_ADDRESS] Cyclophos
phamide (Cytoxan)  
Cyclophospha mide  is a synthe tic anti-neopla stic drug chemically related to the nitrog en 
must ards. It is biot ransformed pr incipally in the liver to active alkyla ting metabolites by a 
mixed func tion microsom al ox idase system. The se metabolites int erfere w ith the grow th of 
susceptible  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_316522] T-ce lls. The m echanism of ac tion is thought to 
involve cr oss-linking of tumor cell DNA. 
Cyclophos
phamide  is well absorbed after o ral administra tion with a bioava ilability greate r 
than 75%. The unchanged drug has an e limin ation half- life of 3 to 12 hour s. It is elimin ated 
primarily in the form of metabolite s, but from 5% to 25% of the dose is excreted in urine a s 
unchanged drug. Several cy totoxic and non-cyt otoxic metabolites have been identified in 
urine and in plasma. Con centrations of metabolites re ach a max imum in plasma 2 to 3 hour s 
after an int ravenous dose. Plasma prote in binding of unchanged drug is low but some 
metabolites are bound to an extent g reater than 60%. It has not been demonst rated than any 
single meta bolite  is responsible for e ither the therape utic or toxic effects  of 
cyclophospha mide. Although elevated leve ls of metabolites of cyclophospha mide  have been 
observed in patients w ith renal fa ilure, increased c linical toxicity in such pa tients has not 
been demonst rated. 
Following c
onversion to active  meta bolites in the liver, cyclophosphamide functions as a n 
alkyla ting agent and posse sses potent immunosuppre ssive  activity. The s erum half- life afte r 
intravenous administ ration ranges from 3 to 12 h ours; the drug and/or its metabolites can b e 
detected in the serum for up to 72 hour s after administra tion.

[IP_ADDRESS] MK-3475  
An open-labe l Phase I tria l (Protocol 001) is being conducted to eva luate the s afety and 
clinical activity of sin gle agent MK-3475.  The do se escalation portion of this t rial evaluated 
three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, a dministered every 2 weeks (Q 2W) in 
subjects with advanced solid tumors.  A ll three dose  leve ls were we ll tole rated and no dose- 
limiting  toxicities were obs erved.  This fir st in human stu dy of MK-3475 showe d evidence of 
target engagement and obj ective  evidence of tu mor si ze re duction a t all dose leve ls (1 mg /kg, 
3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No MTD ha s been id entified to date. 
PK data analy sis of  MK-3475 a dministered Q 2W and Q3W showe d slow syste mic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half- life (re fer to  IB).  Phar macodyna mic data (IL- 
2 release a ssay) sugge sted tha t periphera l targe t engagement is dura ble (> 21 days).  This 
early PK and ph armacodyna mic data provide s scientif ic rationale for a Q2W and Q3W 
dosing schedule. 
A population phar macokine tic analy sis has been p erformed using s erum concent ration time  
data from [ADDRESS_389456] a wide th erape utic 
range based on the melanoma indi cation. The di fferences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed 
dose reg imen rela tive to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based reg imen are antic ipated to 
remain we ll within the  establish ed exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK-3475 in t he 
melanoma indi cation. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar eff icacy and 
safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose reg imen of 2 mg/kg Q3W ( i.e. 
5-fold higher dose and exposure) . The popula tion PK  evaluation re vealed tha t there was no
significant imp act of tumor burden on exposu re. In addition, exposure wa s similar bet ween
the NSCL C and melano ma indications. Ther efore, ther e are no anticipated change s in

8.0 STATISTICAL ANALY SIS PLAN  
 
8.1 Overview and Sa mple Size Justification  
 
The pr imary objec tive of this tria l is to assess the  overall response ra te (ORR) in each ar m. A tota l of 
36 pa tients w ill be  randomized in a 1:1 ra tio to the HD-IL2 and LD IL-2 arms.  With 18 pa tients in  an 
arm, ha lf the width of a two- sided 95% conf idence int erval around the OR R will be  a max imum of 
23%. S econdary endpoi nts in clude s afety, OS, PFS, and blood and tumor biom arkers. Secondar y 
analyse s will consist of com paring s econdary endpoints bet ween the treatm ent arms as well as assessing 
the a ssociation between endpoints and c linical and dis ease covariates of in terest.  As the tria l proceeds, 
the O RR will be  monitored separately in each ar m to a ssure that if it is too lo w, accrual onto the ar m 
will stop.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_389531] 95% conf idence int ervals. 
 
8.3 Seconda ry Analyses  
 
The O RR will be  compared between the two trea tment ar ms by [CONTACT_57971] g Fisher’s exact te st. Safety 
parameter s will be  compared betw een the ar ms by [CONTACT_2329] W ilcoxon ra nk-sum t ests for continuous 
parameter s and F isher’s exact te sts for ca tegori cal parameter s. The method of Ka plan and Meier w ill be 
used to e stima te the distributions of O S and PFS, and distributions w ill be  compared betw een ar ms by 
[CONTACT_316588] [ADDRESS_389532] and O S and PFS. The a ssociation between O RR and the sa me 
covar iates w ill be  assessed by [CONTACT_316589]. For the blood and tumor biom arkers collected 
over time, we w ill use  a gen eralize d linear mi xed mode l (GLMM)  approach to account for intra-patient 
corre lation. 
8.4 Futility Monitor ing 
The pr imary O RR endpo int in this tria l will be monito red using a Baye sian sequentia l monito ring rul e 
(Thall et all, 1995).  If in  either arm, th ere is a  high probab ility that the ORR is less than 40%, accrua l 
onto the ar m will be  stopp ed.  Pa tients w ill be  monito red in cohorts of si ze 3. We w ill enroll a 
minimum of  6 pa tients in  an ar m before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The f ollowing stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s and boundar ies were 
developed using the mult c99 appli cation (ver sion 2.0)  from the Biosta tistic s department. Ac crual will 
be stopped early in any ar m if in th at arm 
Pr [100-day 
ORR <  40% | data] > 0.95 
That is, if  w
e deter mine  that there is a  greater than 95% chance th at the ORR in an ar m is le ss than 
40%, accrua l into the  arm will be  stopped. We a ssume  a be ta (0.8, 1.2) prior distribution for the O RR 
rate (histo rical prior dist ribution based on 1000 pa tients) in each arm, which ha s a mean of 0.40 
corre sponding to the t arget ORR. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_316548] p robability criterion are to

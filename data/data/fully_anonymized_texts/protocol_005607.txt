Use non -professional language  and address each part separately to describe your protocol. Attaching sections of a grant application 
or proposal is not an acceptable substitute. Provide sufficient informatio n for effective review by [CONTACT_409318], including 
non-specialists. Define all abbreviations and terms that are not part of common language.  
 
 
Describe the objective(s) of the proposed research:  
Describe why this research project will be carried out. Clearly state the overall objectives, specific aims, hypotheses (research 
questions), and rationale for performing the study.  
The overall objective of this study is to explore different ways to accele rate learning to improve memory performance.  
 
The first aim of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) stimulating the 
greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17719] (more specifically the C2 area) during a verbal paired -associa te learning task and to determine if 
tDCS targeting the C2 may be used as a way to enhance brain plasticity during an associative memory task to accelerate learning and to optimize associative memory performance. We hypothesize that participants who received real tDCS will 
have a better associative memory performance compared to participants who received sham tDCS.  
 
The second aim is to examine whether repeated retrieval practice can accelerate learning and enhance associative memory performance. By [CONTACT_2329] t wo versions of the verbal paired -associate learning task, we want to investigate the 
influence of repeated studying and repeated retrieval practice on associative memory performance. We hypothesize that participants with repeated retrieval practice will ha ve a better associative memory performance compared to participants 
without repeated retrieval practice.  
 
Describe previous studies that form the basis for the proposed research:  
Associative memory refers to remembering the association between two items, s uch as a face and a name [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a word in 
English and the same word in another language. It is not only important for learning and for navigating daily life, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is impacted by [CONTACT_409319]׳
s disease. For 
decades, neuroscientists have investigated associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and memory. This knowledge contributes to a better basic understanding of learning and memory.  
 
In the last  decade, non -invasive neuromodulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have been 
introduced to modulate cortical brain areas (Nitsche et al. 2008; Matsumoto et al. 2010; Nitsche and Paulus, 2011; Zaehle et al. 2011; Polanìa et al. 2 011; Stagg and Nitsche 2011; Brunoni et al. 2012a) as well as the greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_409302] (more specifically the C2 area) (Plazier et al. 2015). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of neurostimulation which uses constant, low current delivered directly to the brain or the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_409303]. TDCS has been proposed as a therapeutic procedure in various diseases (e.g. Hoy and Fitzgerald 2010; Zyss; 
2010; Benninger et al. 2010; Freitas et al. 2011; Brunelin et al. 2012; Brunoni et al. 2012b; Berlim et al 2013) and tDCS 
in healthy adults have demonstrated to improve cognitive and memory performance (e.g. Floel et al., 2008; De Vries et 
al., 2010; Fiori et al., 2011; Fregni et al., 2005), but few tDCS studies have investigated its impact on associative 
memory. By [CONTACT_409320][INVESTIGATOR_409304] a safer and easier -to-use non -invasive 
neuromodulation procedure. The greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_409305]. Therefore, we aim to increase our understanding of the effects of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) targeting the greater occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17719] (C2) 
during an associative memory task and determine if tDCS may be used as a way to enhance brain plasticity during an 
associative memory task to accelerate learning and to optimize associative memory  performance.  
 
Previous research has also emphasized the importance of repeated learning and repeated retrieval practice as a way to 
accelerate learning and enhance associative memory performance (Karpi[INVESTIGATOR_409306], 2008). Therfore, in this study 
we will also examine the effect of repeated learning and repeated retrieval practice on  associative memory performance 
by [CONTACT_409321]:  
To investigate the effects of tDCS on associative memory performance, we will measure associative memory 
performance in a group that receives active tDCS and a group that receives sham tDCS. To examine the effect of repeated learning and repeated retrieval  practice on long -term memory retrieval, we will use two versions of an 
associative memory task. Assessments will be done immediately after the learning phase as well as one week after to measure possible (long- term) effects on associative memory performan ce. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Page [ADDRESS_516203] Revised 01/2016   Associative memory performance will be measured using a computerized verbal paired -associate learning task, which 
includes Swahili -English vocabulary learning. We will base our task on an experiment published in Science by [CONTACT_409322][INVESTIGATOR_409307] (2014) where all information is provided to conduct the two versions of the Swahili- English vocabulary 
learning test.  
 
The knowledge gained from this study will provide evidence as to whether or not tDCS is possible in accelerating 
learning and in i mproving associative memory and whether repeated testing can enhance associative memory.

Attach surveys, instruments, interview questions, etc. Describe the frequency and duration of procedures, psychological tests, 
educational tests, and experiments; including screening, intervention, follow -up etc.  
Participant’s Review of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Prospective participants will initially review general inclusion and 
exclusion criteria about the study on the flyer where there is contact [CONTACT_409329] a researcher for more 
detailed informat ion about the study. Interested individuals will be screened through a standard phone screen script. 
Their continued interest in the study confirms that they have met basic inclusion/exclusion criteria (via self -report).  
 
Administration of Consent Form: When the Consent form is administered, participants will have already acknowledged 
that they have met the criteria and have expressed continued interest in participating in the study. If, at that time, they 
feel that they do not meet the criteria, or have sp ecific questions about these criteria, they will be asked to inform the 
research team member administering the consent form. If they again meet these criteria to the best of their knowledge, a second set of study screening procedures will be administered t o evaluate whether or not they qualify for the study. 
All of the remaining screening and study procedures described hereinafter will be administered only if the participant has provided consent to participate (i.e., signed the consent  form).  
 
Visit 1: Base line testing and “Learning period“ of the vocabulary paired -associate learning task during tDCS session – 1 
hour:  
 
At the lab, the participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires such as a demographic questionnaire, a 
neuromodulation screening questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory.  
 
After completing the questionnaires, the participant will be set up with the tDCS material that will start real or sham 
stimulation during the vocabulary paired- associate learnin g task. The two electrodes of the tDCS will be placed over the 
left and right C2 nerves dermatomes. For a real stimulation the electrical current will be initially increased in a ramp -like 
fashion over several seconds (5 seconds) until reaching 1.5mA and stimulation will be maintained for the duration of the 
task until it ramps down (5 seconds). For a sham stimulation, the electrical current will be increased in a ramp -like 
fashion over several seconds (5 seconds) until reaching 1.5mA to mimic the sensation  present during the first [ADDRESS_516216], participants will be assigned randomly to different groups.  
 
While the real or sham tDCS stimulation started, the “Learning period” of the computerized vocabulary paired -associate 
learning task will start which consists of 4 blocks (Karpi[INVESTIGATOR_409306], 2008), each consisting of a study phase and a test phase. The  4 blocks are spread with a 30 second distractor task between the blocks. During the study phase 
participants will study 40 successively presented Swahili- English vocabulary pairs comprising common day -to-day words 
(e.g. Swahili: bustani, English: garden).  The word pairs will be presented one below the other in the middle of the 
computer screen for [ADDRESS_516217]: Swahili cue words will be presented successively and participants will 
have to type -in the English translation during up to [ADDRESS_516218] Revised 01/[ADDRESS_516219], participants will need to fill out a tDCS questionnaire.  
 
Visit 2: i.e. [ADDRESS_516220] visit – Approximately 10 minutes: At the lab,  the participants will start the test phase 
of the vocabulary paired -associate learning task. This is identical to the test phase from the learning period, i.e. all 
participants performed a cued -recall test with feedback, but did not restudy the word pairs.

Potential Risks  
Are there risks of physical harm or discomfort associated with the research?  
 Yes   No 
If yes, describe: - The most common side- effect of neurostimulation is temporally local redness of the skin direct 
under the electrode. This disappears within [ADDRESS_516224] balance after  stimulation 
 
- Very rarely, te mporary skin damage may occur under the electrode. This gives a darkening of 
the skin, which normalizes after a weeks and heals. The size of such etch is a few millimeters. 
This is harmless, however, with the current that we will handle, this risk is minim al. 
 
On the safety of tDCS in healthy volunteers, in 2005 a well -conducted study published in the 
Journal of Neurology. There is a group of 103 people total tDCS stimulation given to 2 mA. Outside redness and itching they describe a transient slight improv ement in language fluency 
(pronouncing words) or a transient slight delay in language fluency. The technique is seen as 
safe. 
 
Are there risks of psychological harm or discomfort associated with the research procedure?  
 Yes   No

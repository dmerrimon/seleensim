 [ADDRESS_679244] of myHealth Rewards Program -related Communications on Enrollment: 
Replication  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
 
Study Protocol with Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
June [ADDRESS_679245] of 
different email message conditions (standard promotional email, loss frame , endorsement from 
a medical expert, endorsement from a rank -and- file employee) on enrollment in a wellness 
program (myHealth Rewards) by [CONTACT_523402] (GHP) members.  The current study was 
developed to test whether  a loss frame email was more effective than a standard reminder 
email (replicating an earlier finding) in increasing myHealth Rewards login and enrollment rates.  
It was hypothesized that  the loss frame email would increase enrollment compared with  the 
standard email.  The study also compared testimonials  from a medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a rank -and- file 
employee. This particular comparison was exploratory, and we did not have an a priori hypothesis on the performance of these emails.  
 Methods  
 
Sample  
 
Our population consisted of benefits -eligible Geisinger employees, excluding anyone 
who registered for the [ADDRESS_679246] 1 send date (February 25, 2020).  
 
From the gathered data, we dropped [ADDRESS_679247] registration data (i.e., 
no confirmation if a registration did or did not occur), 506 employees who were not sent any 
email, and 68 employee s who registered before the study period began.  
 
After exclusions, there were 13,546 employees  eligible for the study, with 8,143 who 
previously participated in the program and 5,403 who never participated  (see Table 1 ).  In each 
of these subgroups, employees were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in Wave 1 
(standard email vs. loss frame) Two weeks after the Wave [ADDRESS_679248] 2 (peer endorsement vs expert endorsement).  
 Control and experimental conditions  
 All employees received an email, which began by [CONTACT_523403][INVESTIGATOR_523401], with subject lines and messages varying as shown below.  In Wave 1, employees received either 
the standard or the loss frame email. In Wave 2, employees who did not enroll after Wave [ADDRESS_679249] 1: Standard Email. The standard email  had the subject line “myHealth Rewards 
registration is now open. Sign up to improve your health and save money.” As with the Study [ADDRESS_679250] – early -bird enrollees get entered to a weekly 
drawing for a $[ADDRESS_679251] and will be entered into a final grand prize drawing for one of three prizes worth $500. This group served as the active control group.  
 The other emails in this and subsequent waves contained and built upon all of the same 
information included in the standard email.  
 
Wave 1: Loss frame email.  The loss frame  email had the subject line “Why are you 
throwing away $2,227? ” It suggest ed that employees were  currently "throwing away" a precise 
dollar amount by [CONTACT_523404] (i.e., savings) by [CONTACT_523405].  
 Wave 2:  Expert endorsement  email.  The expert endorsement email (see Figure 11) had 
the subject line “How myHealth Rewards changed my life.” It provide d a testimonial from a 
Geisinger doctor  and emphasize d the simplicity and ease  of taking the first step toward 
enrollment.  The personal endorsement from a doctor presented  a medically -trusted exemplar 
that indicated that the behavior was desirable and feasible.  
 
Wave 2: Peer endorsement  email.  The peer endorsement  email (see Figure 12) had the 
subject line “How myHealth Rewards changed my life.” It provide d a testimonial from a 
Geisinger customer care specialist and emphasize d the simplicity and ease of taking the first 
step toward enrollment.  The personal endorsement from a rank -and- file presented a relatable 
exemplar – relative to many Geisinger staff who are not doctors – that indicated that the 
behavior was desirable and feasible.  
 Wave 3. A planned third wave that compared social norms presented in numeric or 
percentage formats was not conducted due to COVID -19-related changes in the mHR program.  
 Outcome measures  
 
The outcome measures included (1) enrollment in the mHR program, (2) clicking on the 
mHR link in the email, and (3) opening the mHR email within each wave’s two -week duration, 
starting from the date the emails were sent. Wave [ADDRESS_679252] line also varied by [CONTACT_3004]; in Wave 2, the subject lines were the same regardless of condition. 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
We conducted separate, parallel analyses for those who previously participated and 
never participated in the program.  We also conducted separate analyses for waves 1 and 2.  
Binary logistic generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyze (1) enrollment and (2) 
click rates as a function of experimental condition. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, along 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs); two -tailed p-values < 0.[ADDRESS_679253] size, the standardized statistic, Cohen’s d , was 
estimated using the form ula 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿  ×  √3𝜋𝜋⁄ (Hasselblad & Hedges, 1995). Raw 
percentages with 95% CIs were also presented in graphs. All analyses were conducted in R.

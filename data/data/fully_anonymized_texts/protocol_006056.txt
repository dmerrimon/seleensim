Protocol Number:  G201002 
Name [CONTACT_211725]:  Enobosarm (GTx-024) 
Title of Study : Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Parallel Design , 
Phase 2 Study  to Assess Clinical Activity and Safety of 
Enobosarm (GTx-024) in Postmenopausal Women with Stress Urinary Incontinence 
Sponsor:  GTx, Inc. 
Phase of Development:  Phase 2  
Trial  Site(s):  Approximately 70 (US)  
Indication:  Stress Urinary Incontinence 
Rationale: GTx-024 is an orally bioavailable and tissue- selective 
nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that has demonstrated androgenic and anabolic activity and is currently being evaluated as a potential treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in postmenopausal women. 
Urinary incontinence and pelvic floor disorders are major 
health problems for women, especially as they age. Pelvic floor muscle relaxation has been found to correlate with lower urinary tract symptoms including SUI. Muscles of the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract are crucial for supporting the pelvic organs and micturition; however, damage to the muscles or lack of hormonal stimulation are thought to contribute to pelvic organ prolapse and urinary 
incontinenc e. 
Although anabolic steroids may increase muscle mass and 
strength, lack of oral bioavailability and known potential risks have limited their use. Nonsteroidal SARMs have potential to achieve benefits of anabolic steroid therapy (improved muscle mass, cho lesterol/triglyceride levels, 
glucose metabolism, and bone density) with fewer adverse effects, such as hirsutism and acne, in women.  
Both nonclinical and clinical data suggest that SARMs may provide a new therapeutic option for pelvic floor and lower urinary tract disorders, as both testosterone and its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, have anabolic effects on muscle.  
GTx-024 has demonstrated androgenic and anabolic 
activity in male and female rat models.  GTx -024 has 
consistently been observed  to increase body weight, 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol  G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 12 specifically muscle, in female rats. In a male rat model  
with castrate levels of serum testosterone, GTx -024 has the 
ability to induce hypertrophy of the levator ani muscle to 
approximately 120% of a noncastrate male. 
Another SARM  ([COMPANY_004]2849466A), studied in an 
ovariectomized rat model that mimics SUI by [CONTACT_274027], was shown to increase urethral baseline pressure and the amplitude of urethral responses during sneezing by 64% and 74%, respectively, compared to the vehicle control (Kadekawa et al, AUA Annual Meeting 2015, New Orleans, LA. PD27- 11). Further more , 
all of the rats (8/8) in the vehicle -treated group experienced 
fluid leakage during sneezing whereas only 1 of the rats (1/8) in the SARM -treated group experienced such leakage 
upon similar challenge. Histologically, the SARM- treated 
animals had a reversal of the atrophy in urethral muscle observed in the control group. This preliminary in vivo study supports t he clinical study of SARMs for the 
treatment of SUI.  
A proof-of-concept clinical study is currently ongoing to 
investigate the effect of GTx -024 on symptoms of SUI in 
postmenopausal women. Available data from the 18 
subjects dosed at 3 mg GTx -024/day for 12 weeks showed 
a mean reduction in stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] 81%, 
with all [ADDRESS_334856] s seeing a clinically significant reduction 
(> 50% reduction in stress leaks) in the number of stress 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274002] 12. 
Objectives:  Primary Objective - Efficacy

the efficacy of GTx -024 (1 mg and 3 mg administered once 
daily) to that of placebo by [CONTACT_274028]- reported stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_914] .  
The primary efficacy endpoint is a responder analysis, 
where a responder is defined as having a ≥ 50% reduction 
at the end of treatment (Week 12) compared to baseline in the mean number of stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274003] [ADDRESS_334857]

bowel symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on daily life.  
• 24-hour Pad Weight Test  
The 24-hour pad weight test is a quantitative test intended to provide information on the severity of incontinence. The amount of urine leaked over the 24 hours of testing is quantified by [CONTACT_274041].  
• MESA  
The MESA  incontinence questionnaire consists of 
15 items divided into stress incontinence (9 items) and urge incontinence (6 items) subscales. Based on their responses, subjects can be characterized as having predominant stress incontinence, urge incontinence, or mixed incontinence (Herzog and Fultz 1990).   
Safety Assessments:  Safety assessments will include:   
• Adverse events 
• Clinical laboratory analyses  
• Levels of SHBG and testosterone

Protocol  G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 22 Sample Size Calculation: The sample size calculation was performed using PASS 
v12.0.1 for binary outcomes. The sample size calculation was performed for a binary response (i.e., a responder is defined as having a ≥ 50% reduction at the end of 
treatment compared to baseline in the mean number of 
stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274010] 3-day voiding diary). The assumptions were a 60% active treatment response and 40% placebo response. The overall discontinuation rate was anticipated to be approximately 25%. 
Given these assumptions, a randomized sample size of 
approximately 400 subjects (randomized in a 1:1:1  ratio 
for placebo, 1 mg GTx -024, 3 mg GTx -024, respectively) 
will have  80% power to detect a treatment difference of 
20%. A 2-sided hypothesis test with 5% significance is used for each pairwise comparison between GTx -024 and 
placebo ( i.e., alternatively using a 1- sided significance 
level o f 2.5%).

Protocol  G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 23 Analysis Sets:  Data analysis will be performed on a full analysis set 
(FAS), a per protocol set (PPS), an intent- to-treat (ITT) set, 
a durability set (DS), and a safety analysis (SA) set.  
The FAS is used for the primary analysis. The FAS consists 
of all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_334870] baseline primary efficacy assessment (3 -day voiding diary). All analyses 
using the FAS will group participants according to randomized treatment.  
The PPS is used for a supportive analysis and will also be defined as all subjects included in the FAS who do not have any significant protocol deviations. All analyses using the PPS will group subjects according to treatment actually received.  
The ITT set consists of all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_334871] 1 dose of study drug. All efficacy analyses performed on the FAS will be 
repeated on the PPS and the ITT  set.  
Methods of Analysis : Before unblinding, a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized, providing detailed methods for all 
endpoints. In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values for continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for categorical variable) will be provided by [CONTACT_6982]. Source data for summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data listings.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (v9.4 or higher). Unless stated otherwise, all statistical tests will be 2-sided using a 5% significance level, leading to 95% (2-sided) confidence intervals. No adjustment will be made 
for multiplicity due to 2 dose levels of GTx-024 being 
compared with placebo. The trial is not powered to show a statistical  difference between the 2 dose arms of GTx -024.

Protocol  G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 24 The primary efficacy period is defined as baseline (Day 0) 
through Week 12. Change from baseline and determination 
of responder rate status will be between baseline and visits through Week 12. The durability period is defined as Week 12 to Week 16, Week  20, and/or Week 28. 
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary analysis will be conducted on the primary 
endpoint using the FAS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., a binary response 
indicator where a responder is defined as having a ≥ 50% 
reduction at the end of treatment compared to baseline in the mean number of stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274003] 3 -day voiding diary) will be evaluated 
using a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model will include treatment group as a covariate. The odds ratio of response between each dose level of GTx-024 and placebo (together with the corresponding 95% confidence interval) will be reported. The null hypothesis is that there  is no treatment effect for either dose level of 
GTx-024. This will be tested against the alternative 
hypothesis that there is a treatment effect for at least [ADDRESS_334872] missing values at these visits will be counted as non-responders for this analysis.  Sensitivity analyses will 
be specified in the SAP.  
Analysis of Secon dary Efficacy Endpoints 
For binary secondary endpoints (responders), the treatment 
effect will be estimated using a logistic regression model with treatment as a covariate.  
For continuous secondary endpoints, treatment effects will be estimated using a mixed model repeated measures analysis (MMRM). The MMRM model will specify an unstructured variance/covariance matrix and will include 
treatment group, visit, and baseline as covariates. 
For ordinal endpoints , treatment effects will be estimated 
using a proportional odds model.  Further details on the analysis of secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be provided in the SAP. 
Analysis of Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
Durability of treatment effect will be examined in the DS 
for the exploratory efficacy endpoints. Additional 
sensitivity analyses of exploratory and secondary efficacy 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-[ADDRESS_334873] to missing data. 
Further details of the exploratory analyses will be provided in the SA P.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety parameters (including AEs, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, SHBG, testosterone, and endometrial stripe thickness) will be summarized using the SA set . No formal hypothesis testing will be performed. 
All AEs will be coded using the latest version of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) . All 
treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized and 
presented in the listings by [CONTACT_274042], the percentage of subjects with that event, the number of events, and the grade, duration, and relationship to treatment. Percentages will be based on the number of subjects who received each treatment during the study.  
Clinical laboratory safety tests will be performed, and 
normal ranges will be provided for each lab test. Values outside the normal range will be assessed for clinical significance by [CONTACT_093]. Shift tables (change from baseline value to on- treatment values) will be presented for 
each laboratory measurement and assessment time. Each parameter outside the normal range will be designated as high (H) or low (L) in the individual data listings.

 Page 28 1 Introduction  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
Enobosarm ( GTx-024) is an orally bioavailable and tissue- selective nonsteroidal selective 
androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that has demonstrated androgenic and anabolic 
activity and is currently being evaluated as a potential treatment for stress urinary 
incontinence (SUI) in postmenopausal women. 
Urinary incontinence and pelvic floor disorders are major health problems for women, 
especially as they age ( Luber  2004) . Pelvic flo or muscle relaxation has been found to 
correlate with lower urinary tract symptoms including SUI. Muscles of the pelvic floor and lower urinary tract are crucial for supporting the pelvic organs and micturition; however, 
damage to the muscles and/or lack o f hormonal stimulation are thought to contribute to 
pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence.  
Although anabolic steroids may increase muscle mass and strength, lack of oral 
bioavailability and known potential risks have limited their use ( Mohler  et al 2009). 
Nonsteroidal SARMs have potential to achieve benefits of anabolic steroid therapy (improved muscle mass, cholesterol/triglyceride levels, glucose metabolism, and bone 
density) with fewer adverse effects, such as hirsutism and acne, in women.  
Both nonclinical and clinical data suggest that SARMs may provide a new therapeutic option for pelvic floor and lower urinary tract disorders, as both testosterone and its more potent 
metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, have anabolic effects on muscle.  
GTx-024 has demonstrated androgenic and anabolic activity in male and female rat models. 
GTx-024 has consistently been observed to increase body weight, specifically muscle, in 
fema le rats. In a male rat model with castrate levels of serum testosterone, GTx -024 has the 
ability to induce hypertrophy of the levator ani muscle to approximately 120% of a 
noncastrate male.  
Another SARM ([COMPANY_004]2849466A), studied in an ovariectomized rat model that mimics SUI 
by [CONTACT_274027], was shown to increase urethral baseline pressure and the 
amplitude of urethral responses during sneezing by 64% and 74%, respectively, compared to 
the vehicle control ( GTx, Inc. 2017;  Kadekawa et al 2015 ). Further more , all of the rats (8/8) 
in the vehicle-treated group experienced fluid leakage during sneezing whereas only 1 of the 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 29 rats (1/8) in the SARM -treated group experienced such leakage upon similar challenge. 
Histologically, the SARM- treated animals had a reversal of the atrophy in urethral muscle 
observed in the control group. This preliminary in vivo study supports the clinical study  of 
SARMs for the treatment of SUI.  
A pro of-of-concept study is currently ongoing to investigate the effect of GTx-024 on 
symptoms of SUI in postmenopausal women. Available data from the 18 subjects dosed at 
3 mg GTx -024/day for 12 weeks showed a mean reduction in  stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] 
81%, with all [ADDRESS_334876] s seeing a clinically significant reduction ( > 50% reduction in stress 
leaks) in the number of stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274002] 12.

 Page 33 3 Investigational Plan  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, randomized, multicenter, Phase 2 
study to assess the clinical activity and safety of GTx -024 in postmenopausal women with 
SUI. The study consists of the following periods: screening period, treatment period, 
follow-up period, and durability period.  
Screening Period (4 Weeks)  
Potential subject s will be evaluated during a screening period lasting no more than 4 weeks. 
After written informed consent is obtained, Screening Visit  procedures will be performed as 
specified in the schedule of events ( Table  12–1).  
Treatment Period (12 Weeks)  
At Baseline (Visit 1, Week 0), subjects who continue to meet all eligibility criteria will be 
randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms  in a 1:1:1 ratio  for a 12- week, 
double-blind treatment period. Subjects will be assigned to one  of the following treatment 
groups: [ADDRESS_334878] a phone call follow up at Week 1 and attend 
the clinic at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 during the treatment period. At each clinic visit, study procedures will be performed as specified in the schedule of events ( Table  12–1).  All unused 
study drug will be collected at Week 12 (Visit  5), the end of the treatment period.  
Follow- up Period ( 4 Weeks)  and Durability Per iod (16 Weeks)  
Upon completion of Week 12 ( Visit 5), all subjects will enter either a [ADDRESS_334879] 225 randomized subjects only will enter the Durability  Period of the study. Visit 5, 
12 weeks after the start of treatment, is the baseline for the 16 -week durability  period, during 
which time no study drug will be administered. During the Durability  period , there will be 
clinic visits at Week 16 , Week 20, and Week 28. At each visit, study procedures will be 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 34 performed as specified in the schedule of events ( Table  12–1). Data from the follow -up 
period will be used to assess the durability of the effect of GTx -024. 
All other randomized subjects (those not included in the first 2 25) will complete a 4-week 
follow-up period following Week 12 (Visit 5) during which time no study drug will be 
administered . The follow-up period includes a clinic visit at Week 16 where study procedures 
will be performed as specified in the schedule of events ( Table  12–1). 
Subject completion is defined as completing all phases of the study through durability 
(Week  28) for the first 225 randomized subjects and through follow-up (Week 1 6) for all 
other randomized subjects. The maximum  duration of each subject’s participation will be 
≤ [ADDRESS_334880] of GTx -024. No study drug will be 
administered during this durability extension study. 
Subjects who complete the required treatment period and durability or follow-up periods of 
this study may be offered the opportunity to enter into an open-label extension study under a 
separate protocol. Subjects will receive study drug during this open- label extension study. 
3.1.1 Rationale of Study Design   
A double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel design study with a 12-week duration of 
treatment has demonstrated the efficacy of duloxetine for the treatment of North American 
women with SUI , using data from a voiding diary as the primary outcome variable 
(Norton  et al 2002, Dmochowski  et al 2003).  
In prior clinical studies, GTx-024 has been generally well tolerated, including single doses up 
to 100 mg and multiple doses up to 30 mg once daily for up to 14 days. In longer studies, GTx-024 has also been generally well tolerated at 1, 3, and 9 mg daily doses for up to 
833 days ( GTx, Inc. 2017). The selection of the 3 mg GTx-024 maximum daily dose in this 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 35 study was informed by [CONTACT_274049] a proof-of-concept study of 3 mg GTx -024 per day 
for 12 weeks in subjects with SUI, wherein all 18  subjects a clinically meaningful (> 50% 
reduction in stress leaks) decrease in the frequency of SUI epi[INVESTIGATOR_56162] [ADDRESS_334881] after cessation of treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Risk Mitigation  
This study has been designed to mitigate known risks associated with the use of GTx-024. 
Clinical study G200501 observed the effects of administering doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mg of GTx -024 (or placebo) for 86 days to healthy subjects: postmenopausal women and elderly 
men. A dose- dependent increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase was observed . A higher incidence of transient, asymptomatic increases in 
ALT reported as adverse events occurred in the group receiving 3 mg GTx -024 (20.8%) 
compared to placebo (0%). One subject receiving 3 mg per day of GTx-024 was discontinued 
for an ALT level > [ADDRESS_334882] s of other orally administered 
anabolic agents, GTx-024 causes a dose dependent reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the clinical significance of which is unknown at this time. The proposed mechanism 
for reduction in HDL is due to stimulation of re verse cholesterol transport and increased 
HDL catabolism by [CONTACT_274050]. Reductions in HDL are temporary and typi[INVESTIGATOR_274014] 12 months after treatment initiation.

from the study  before completing treatment. Subjects who are not return ing for final 
assessments will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (2 documented telephone calls followed by 1 registered letter) 
by [CONTACT_274053]. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of an AE or serious AE 
(SAE ). In every case, efforts must be made to undertake protocol- specified, safety follow -up 
procedures. All data collected from all subject s, including early withdrawals and early 
discontinuations of treatment, will be used in the reporting and analysis of the study. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_334893] been randomly assigned to receive study drug  and who subsequently 
discontinue prematurely from the study  will not be replaced. Subjects who fail to satisfy

Protocol : G201002  Version 4.[ADDRESS_334894] will be administered orally once daily and supplied as opaque, white 
to off-white, size 5, oval Softgel capsules.  
Subjects assigned to receive GTx -024 1 mg will be required to take two (2) 0.5 mg GTx -024 
capsules once daily. Subjects assigned to receive GTx -024 3 mg will be required to take 
one (1) 3 mg GTx-024 capsule and one (1) placebo capsule once  daily.  Subjects assigned to 
receive placebo will be required to take two (2) placebo capsules once daily.  
5.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive placebo, 1 mg 
GTx-024, or 3 mg GTx -024 in a 1:1:1 ratio.  
An interactive web response system ( IWRS ) will be used to administer the randomization 
schedule . Biostatistics will generate the randomization schedules using SAS software Version 
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc ., Cary, North Carolina) or later . The IWRS  will link sequential subject 
randomization numbers to treatment codes.  
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Study drug (Section 5 ) will be taken orally with water at approximately the same time each 
day, with or without food. Subjects will be instructed to take 2 capsules each day .  
5.3 Identity of Study Drug

6.3.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  of Adverse Events  
The investigator is respo nsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study regardless of their possible relationship to study drug or their clinical significance.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject enrolled into this study regardless of its causal relationship to study drug . Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_160522]. 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to 
study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after 
exposure to study drug and within the 30 days following discontinuation of drug treatment 
An SAE is defined as any event that results in one of the following conditions: 
• Death  
• Life-threaten ing event (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event) 
• An event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• An event that results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• An event that results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 56 • Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185508], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be assessed beginning at enrollment (date of signed informed consent) 
through the completion of the durability or follow up period.  
Serious AEs that occur more than [ADDRESS_334926] been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and OTC  medications).  
In addition to subject observations, AEs identified from any study data (e.g., laboratory 
values, physical examination findings, electrocardiogram [ ECG] changes) or identified from 
review of other documents (e.g., subject diaries) that are relevant to subject safety  will be 
documented on the AE page in  the eCRF . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatment, dose, event term, time of onset, 
investigator- specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. 
All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs.  
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.[ADDRESS_334927] is screened should not be 
reported as an AE. However, if a pre-existing condition changes in intensity or frequency at 
any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Any AE that meets SAE criteria ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) must be entered into the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system immediately (i.e., within 1 business day ) after site personnel first learn 
of the event. Once the qualifying SAE data are entered, pharmacovig ilance will be notified 
by [CONTACT_183004] , which will contain high level safety information. Additional safety 
information will be obtained from the EDC system via applicable eCRF pages. If the EDC 
system is not available, the site should send a completed paper SAE report form to 
pharmacovigilance by [CONTACT_40743]: 
• Safety Fax Line: 1 -[PHONE_5692] (US toll- free)  
• Safety Email: [EMAIL_5215]  
When the EDC system is again available, the site must enter all applicable information into 
the EDC system . All supporting source information concerning the SAE (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553]) should be provided by [CONTACT_40743].  
If there is a question concerning an SAE, the site needs guidance regarding reporting of an 
SAE, the site is returning a call from a safety  specialist, or the site urgently needs to report an 
SAE or make pharmacovigilance aware of an SAE, the Safety Hotline should be used:  
• Safety Hotline: 1-866- 966-8429 (US toll free) 
If a site makes an initial report of an SAE by [CONTACT_19647], the sit e must subsequently 
enter all applicable information into the EDC system immediately thereafter.

as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study  drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. 
The relationship or association of the test article in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the followi ng classification and criteria:  
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 59 Unrelated:  This relationship suggests that there is no association between the study drug  
and the reported event. 
 
Possible:  This relationship suggests that treatment with the study drug caused or 
contributed to the AE, i.e., the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration or follows a known response pattern to 
the study drug  but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604]. 
 
Probable:  This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with drug administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological 
action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of drugs, or judgm ent based on the investigator’s clinical experience, 
the association of the event with the study drug seems likely.  The event 
disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the dose of study drug. 
 
Definite:  This relationship suggests that a definit e causal relationship exists between 
drug administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event . The event reappears or worsens if  the study  
drug is re -administered.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Subjects Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and be monitored to 
satisfactory resolution , until the investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant , or until the subject is considered to be stable. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_334928]’s participation in the study may be 
discontinued. 
Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if:  
• ALT or AST > 8 × upper l imit of normal (ULN) 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 60 • ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio (INR) > 1.5 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia ( differential count > 5%) 
In the event that ALT or AST is > 3 × ULN, the subject will return for an unscheduled clinic 
visit and blood will be drawn for a coagulation panel to determine the INR. The INR will be 
determined at a local laboratory.  
All subjects discontinued from the study should be followed until abnormal values return to normal, and all discontinuations should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to 
discontinuation.  
6.3.3 Safety Assessments 
The s afety assessments will include AEs (Section  6.3.1), vital sign measurements, height and 
weight, concomitant medications, medical history, physical examination findings, 
transvaginal ultrasound, and clinical laboratory analyses ( Section  6.6). Refer to  Table  12–1 
for a detailed schedule of the timing of study procedures. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements include oral temperature, seated BP, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]. 
Vital sign measurements will be collected as indicated in Table  12–1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Height and Weight 
Height will be measured at screening only and weight will be measured as indicated in 
Table  12–1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
At the Screening Visit, the Investigator or designee must record the use of prescription and 
OTC medication  taken within the prior 30 days. Concomitant medications (including 
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 61 prescription and OTC medications) will be assessed and recorded  throughout the study  
(Table  12–1).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medical History  
A detailed review of medical history , conducted at  the Screening Visit,  will include review of 
gravida, prior abortions, parity, deliveries, and history of gynecological conditions , surgeries,  
and cancer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination  
The purpose of the physical examination is to identify any medical conditions that would 
impact eligibility of the subject at screening, and to identify any changes that occur as a 
result of treatment. Physical examination will include visual inspection, chest auscultation, 
organ and lymph node palpation, skin turgor, and brief neuro logic exam (muscle strength, 
reflexes, sensation ). The visual inspection should include a visual skin examination with 
specific attention to any androgenic changes (acne, hirsutism). Physical examinations will be 
performed as indicated in Table  12–1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Transvaginal Ultrasound  
Only for subjects with an intact uterus, transvaginal ultrasound  will be performed at 
screening  and at the end of treatment (Visit 5 ) to observe changes in the endometrial stripe 
thickness (mm).  Transvaginal ultrasound examinations will be evaluated locally.  
6.[ADDRESS_334929] will be conducted at the Screening Visit and  
at Visit 5 (Table  12–1). The purpose of the pelvic examination at screening is to identify any 
gynecologic findings that might impact the patient’s participation in the trial, and at the end 
of the treatment period to note whether any changes have occurred. The pelvic exam should 
include external inspection, speculum, and bimanual examinations.

ECG tracing should be labeled with the study number, subject initials (where regulations 
permit), and subject number. Interpretation of the tracing must be made by a qualified 
physician. Results from 12- lead ECG examination should be captured in the ECG Evaluation 
eCRF. Clinically significant abnormalities present at screening should be reported on the Medical History eCRF page. Clinically significant findings should be discussed with the 
medical monitor prior to randomizing the subject in the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_274022]. The ECG may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator at 
any time during the study as clinically indicated, and any clinically relevant findings should 
be added to the AE eCRF.

pregnancy must be followed- up to determine the outcome (including spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and status of 
mother and child, even if the subject was discontinued from the study. Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous miscarriages must be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_160524], must be promptly reported to pharmacovigilance.

investigator may repeat these checks if clinically indicated).  
• Serum follicle stimulating hormone  
• Complete blood count with differential  
• Urinalysis dipstick testing  for blood, protein, and leukocytes will be performed on a clean 
catch midstream voided urine specimen. If results or clinical symptoms indicate a 
possible urinary tract infection (UTI), the specimen will be sent for culture. If the culture 
is positive, the subject will receive appropriate treatment for UTI per standard of  care. If 
the subject has a positive urine culture at the time of screening, she will be considered a screen ing failure  and will not be enrolled until she has been treated  for a UTI , the UTI 
symptoms disappear, and a dipstick urinalysis is consistent with the absence of a UTI.

 Page 67 Additional sensitivity analyses may be included in exploratory analyses. These analyses will 
be described in further detail in the SAP.   
7.4 Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size calculation was performed using PASS v12.0.1 for binary outcomes. The 
sample size calculation was performed for a binary response (i .e., a responder is defined as 
having a ≥ 50% reduction at the end of treatment compared to baseline in the mean number 
of stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274010] 3- day voiding diary) . The 
assumptions were a 60% active treatment response and 40% placebo response. The overall discontinuation rate was anticipated to be approximately 25%. 
Given these assumptions, a randomized sample size of approximately 400 subjects 
(randomized in a 1:1:1  ratio for placebo, 1 mg GTx -024, and 3 mg GTx -024, respectively) 
will have  80% power to detect a treatment difference of 20%. A 2-sided hypothesis test with 
5% significance is assumed for each pairwise comparison between GTx-024 and placebo 
(i.e., alternatively using a 1-sided significance level of 2.5%). 
7.5 Analysis Sets 
Data analysis will be performed on a full analysis set (FAS), a per protocol set (PPS), an 
intent -to-treat (ITT) set, a durability set (DS), and a safety analysis (SA) set.  
The FAS is used for the primary analysis. The FAS consists of all randomized subjects who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_334937] baseline primary efficacy 
assessment (3 -day voiding diary). All analyses using the FA S will group participants 
according to randomized treatment.  
The PPS is used for a supportive analysis and will be defined as all subjects included in the FAS who d o not have any significant protocol deviations. All analyses using the PPS will 
group subject s according to treatment actually received.  
The ITT set consists of all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_334938] any postbaseline assessments will be treated as non -responders for ITT 
analyses.  
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.[ADDRESS_334939] 1 dose of study 
drug. All analyses using the SA set  will group subjects according to treatment actually 
received.   
All efficacy anal yses performed on the FAS will be repeated on the PPS and the ITT set. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP.   
7.6 Description of Subgroups to be Analyzed 
No subgroup analyses are planned. 
7.7 Statistical Analysis Methodology  
Before unblinding, a separate SAP will be finalized, providing detailed methods for all 
endpoints. In general, summary statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum values for continuous variables, and number [%] of subjects in each category for 
categorical variabl e) will be provided by [CONTACT_6982]. Source data for summary 
tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data listings.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (v9.4 or higher). Unless stated 
otherwise, all statistical tests will be 2-sided using a 5% significance level, leading to 95% 
(2-sided) confidence intervals. No adjustment will be made for multiplicity due to 2 dose 
levels of GTx -024 being compared with placebo. The trial is not powered to show a 
statistical difference between the 2 dose arms of GTx -024. 
The primary efficacy period is defined as baseline (Day 0) through Week 12. Change from 
baseline and determination of responder rate status will be between baseline and visits 
through Week 12. The durability period is defined as Week 12 to Week 16, Week  20, and/or 
Week  28.  
7.7.1 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary analysis will be conducted on the primary endpoint using the FAS.  
GTx, Inc.  GTx-024 
Protocol : G201002  Version 4.0 10 April 2018 
 Page 69 The primary efficacy endpoint (i.e., a binary response indicator where a responder is defined 
as having a ≥ 50% reduction at the end of treatment compared to baseline in the mean 
number of stress incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_274010] 3 -day voiding diary) will 
be evaluated using a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model will include 
treatment group as a covariate. The odds ratio of response between each dose level of 
GTx-024 and placebo (together with the corresponding 95% confidence interval) will be 
reported. The null hypothesis is that there is no treatment effect for either dose level of 
GTx-024. This will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that there is a treatment effect 
for at least [ADDRESS_334940] missing diary data for the screening period or the Week 12 visit will be counted as non-responders for 
this analysis .  
Sensitivity analyses  will be specified in the SAP.  
7.7.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
For binary secondary endpoints (responders), the treatment effect will be estimated using a 
logistic regression model with treatment as a covariate.  
For continuous secondary endpoints, treatment effects will be estimated using a mixed model repeated measures analysis (MMRM) . The MMRM model will specify an unstructured 
variance/covariance matrix  and include treatment group, vi sit, and baseline as covariates.   
For ordinal endpoints , treatment effects will be estimated using  a proportional odds model.  
Further details on the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be provided in the SAP.

treatment. Percentages will be based on the number of subjects who received each treatment during the study. 
Clinical laboratory safety tests will be performed, and normal ranges will be provided for 
each lab oratory  test. Values outside the normal range will  be assessed for clinical significance 
by [CONTACT_093]. Shift tables (change from baseline value to on- treatment values) will be 
presented for each laboratory measurement and assessment time. Each parameter outside the 
normal range will be designated a s high (H) or low (L) in the individual data listings .

implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments 
should be submitted to the IRB for review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to 
the regulator y authorities, if required. 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures or processes approved by [CONTACT_274066]. A significant deviation  occurs when there is nonad herence to the protocol by [CONTACT_21768] a significant,  additional risk to the subject. Significant 
deviations can include nonadherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria , enrollment of the 
subject without prior Sponsor approval, or nonadherence to FDA regulations or ICH GCP 
guidelines, and will lead to the subject being withdrawn from the study (Section  4.2). 
Protocol deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_11782]. Principal investigators will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_21769]. The IRB  should be notified of all protocol deviations in a timely manner.

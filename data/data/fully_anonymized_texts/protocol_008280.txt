Specific Aims  
The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the CleanSweep™ Closed Suction System on time to 
first successful SBT in mechanically ventilated patients in the medical intensive care unit. 
Secondary aims of this study are to evaluate the use endotracheal tube sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_396656] l ength of mechanical ventilation,  length of ICU stay, length of total 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408],  and occurrence of ventilator -associated events.  
Introduction  
 Mechanical ventilation (MV) is utilized when the patient’s work of breathing (WOB) 
exceeds their capacity to do that work, with risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_396657]. Approximately 
half of the time spent  on MV is on the process of weaning and discontinuing this support as soon 
as possible. The focus on MV liberation is due to the associated complications, including an 
increased risked of pneumonia.1 The weaning process can be challenging and is categorize d as 
simple, difficult, or prolonged in regards to weaning success.1 Difficult to wean patients are 
categorized as such by [CONTACT_396670] (SBT) and require up to 
three subsequent SBTs to pass; or up to seven days to compl etely wean from mechanical 
ventilation after the initial SBT. The difficult and prolonged to wean groups account for 
approximately 31% of the patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. It has been reported that 
these groups combined account for a 25% mor tality rate.1 Others reported the incidence and 
mortality related to these weaning categories in a large cohort study on 257 patients, where the 
simple to wean group represented 59% with a mortality rate of 13%, the difficult to wean group 
represented 26% of patients with a 9% mortality rate, and the prolonged weaning group 
represented 14% of the group with a 32% mortality rate.2 
Evidence-based guidelines were published over a decade ago to help guide the weaning 
process and are still applicable today. Once  the acute underlying disease process associated with 
the initiation of mechanical ventilation has improved and spontaneous breathing efforts are 
evident, patients are assessed for their readiness to wean and extubate. Physiologic signs 
including respi[INVESTIGATOR_396658], gas exchange, hemodynamic stability, body temperature, 
hemoglobin levels, and mental status are all used to determine the discontinuation of mechanical 
ventilator support.3 Patients are then assessed for discontinuation of mechanical ventilatio n by 
5.15.2020  
 
using a SBT. A SBT involves a low level of mechanical ventilatory support or a T -pi[INVESTIGATOR_396659]. The methods of performing a SBT are variable and the 
recommendations from the literature are inconsistent on this topic. The main  purpose of the SBT 
is to mimic spontaneous breathing to assess a patient’s ability to breathe without the assistance of 
a mechanical ventilator.3,4  
A SBT is performed to evaluate  a patient’s ability to balance the respi[INVESTIGATOR_396660] . Factors that cause a load/capacity imbalance (e.g., increased R AW, 
decreased lung compliance) often result in failed SBTs. Because of this, clinicians should ensure 
proper conditions when performing SBTs. Mucus buildup in the endotrac heal tube, which results 
in luminal narrowing of the tube , can cause this load/capacity imbalance due to the increase in 
RAW.5 Mietto et al noted that ETT luminal narrowing is common and can  increase in airflow 
resistance. They noted that this narrowing oc curred despi[INVESTIGATOR_396661].6 Wilson and colleagues studied the pressure drop across a sample of used ETTs and 
found that 33% of these tubes reflected an inner diameter change that matched an unused tube 
one size smaller. They als o reported that in approximately 20 -35% of patients, the change in 
pressure was greater than [ADDRESS_498998] the ability to sweep ETTs; in addition to inline suction catheters (termed standard in this 
document) that cannot sweep ETTs. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the 
CleanSweep™ Closed Suction System , which is used at Rush University Medical Center,  on 
time to first successful SBT  in mechanically ventilated patients in  the medical intensive care 
unit. Secondary aims of this study are to evaluate the use endotracheal tube sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_396662] , length of ICU stay, length of total 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and occurrence of  ventilator -associated events.  
Experimental Design and methods   
 This is designed as a prospective, randomized control trial, in a large, urban, academic 
5.15.2020  
 
medical center. This study will include mechanically ventilated patients  (n = 272) in the medical 
intensive care unit (MICU)  and adult intensive care unit  at Rush University Medical Center . It 
will exclude patients with a tracheostomy on admission, those requiring extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation ( ECMO), or transferred from an outside facility receiving more than 24 
hours of mechanical ventilation. Two groups will be randomly assigned via computer 
randomization. The comparison  group will be placed on the CleanSweep™ Closed Suction 
System immediately afte r intubation or upon arrival to the MICU. ETTs will be cleaned with the 
balloon sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_396663] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_396664] s the patient . The standard 
group will be placed on the standard in -line suction device. Airway suctioning will be  performed 
in both groups as per department policy (Catheter advanced until resistance is met and 
withdrawn slowly for a duration no longer than 15 seconds while applying negative pressure). 
Both groups will also receive a ventilator bundle that consists o f head of bed elevation, ETT cuff 
pressure management, DVT prevention, daily sedation interruption  and SBT, and oral care every 
4 hours with chlorhexidine at 12pm (noon) and 12am midnight.  
Procedures Done for Research Purpose  
• Comparison  Group (CleanSweep™  Closed Suction System)  
o In addition to suctioning performed as per department policy, ETTs cleaned with 
balloon sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_396665].  
• Standard Group (Standard in -line suction device)  
o Suctioning performed as per de partment policy  
Subject Population  
Two hundre d and seventy -two orally  intubated, adult patients ≥ 18 year of age  will be enrolled .     
Inclusion criteria: 
• Age ≥ 18 y/o  
• Orally intubated with endotracheal tu be 
• Mechanically ventilated < 24 hours prior to enrollment  
Exclusion  criteria:  
5.15.2020  
 
• Age < 18 y/o 
• Tracheostomy tube  
• Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  
• Transfer from outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396666] 24 hours of mechanical ventilation  
Recruitment  and Consent Procedures:  
• Recruitment  will be based on the inclusion and exclusion  criteria.  
Compensation:  
• There will be no compensation provided to participants for participation in this study.  
Risk to subject:  
• Risks include potential des aturation during ETT scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. To prevent or lessen the 
possibility  of oxygen desaturation, the  patient will be preoxygenated with 100% oxygen 
for 1 to 2 minutes before ETT cleaning  is performed .  
Special Precautions:  
• All study material will be coded to de-identify participants and a separate list will be kept 
with the participant’s ID and name.  
• All identifiers will be removed prior to analysis. Study subjects will not be re -identified 
or contact[CONTACT_396671].   
Confidentiality : 
• The study investigators, along with the IRB, will have access to the individual 
participant’s results.  Neither names nor personal information will be recorded or included 
in the data analysis. The investigators will strictly adhere to IRB guidelines to ensure that 
participant’s confidentiality is maintained.  
Plans for Data Analysis: 
• Calculated sample size. Based on previous institutional data, length of mechanical 
5.15.[ADDRESS_498999] is 
estimated at a 20% reduction in the length of mechanical ventilation (6.3 x .20 = 1.26 
days). Standardized effect size would be 35% (1.26/3.64). Setting alpha at 0.[ADDRESS_499000] size of 0.35 would require 136 patients in each  
group or 272 total number of subjects. Estimated completion would be 18 to 24 months.   
• Data for each patient will be recorded in REDCap, a secure web -based database. 
Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated from the information collected fr om 
patients’ charts. Patients were divided into two groups based on randomization. Each 
group’s time to first successful SBT and length of mechanical ventilation outcomes will 
be compared using an independent T -test if the  data is normally distributed. Ventilator-
associated conditions and infection related ventilation associated complications rates for 
both groups will be compared using Chi -Square analysis. Level of significance will be set 
at p < 0.05.

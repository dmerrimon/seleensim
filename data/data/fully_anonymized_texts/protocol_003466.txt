Psychological Intervention to Promote Copi[INVESTIGATOR_492176] (HCT)  
Protocol version 1/ [ADDRESS_632971] a multicomponent 
psychological intervention for caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HCT). During HCT, patients receive high -dose chemotherapy, which is associated with multiple toxicities 
and leads to burdensome  physical symptoms and a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Moreover, during the first 
[ADDRESS_632972] -transplant while the patient continues to experience many challenging physical symptoms, 
both patients and their families attend multiple outpatient appointments, manage complex medication 
schedules, and cope with the uncertainty of the patient’s prognosis. Thus, the family and close friends  (i.e. 
caregivers)  of patients undergoing HCT  are substantially impacted by [CONTACT_102]’s illness.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_492177] l and psychological burd en experienced by [CONTACT_492199], few interventions have been developed to address their needs during the transplant.  Prior research 
on caregivers’  intervention has been challenging with many inconclusive or n egative studies due to poorly 
defined interventions that are not specific to a particular population. Thus, there is a critical need to develop 
population -specific interventions with a sound methodological approach to address the specia lized needs 
of careg ivers  and provide them with the necessary skills to care for and cope with their loved ones’ illness.  
We conducted a prospective longitudinal study o f patients and caregivers  during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492178], 
which clearly delineated  the needs of caregivers  during the transplant  process. We utilized our data and a 
systematic review of the literature to develop a preliminary multicomponent psychological intervention to 
promote effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_492179] -being.  In this proposed project, we will procee d in two phases 
that incorporate sequential mixed qualitative and quantitative methods. At this time, we are seeking IRB 
approval for phase 1 procedures only. During phase 1, we will obtain qualitative data from  5-10 caregivers  
who will participate in the psychological intervention during their loved ones’ HCT course to refine the 
intervention content and schedule to specifically meet the needs of caregivers .  
After  finaliz ing the psychological intervention in Phase 1, we will then seek IRB approval to cond uct Phase 
[ADDRESS_632973] -transplant  while the patient 
continues to experience many challenging ph ysical symptoms, both patients and their families attend 
multiple outpatient appointments, manage complex medication schedules, and cope with the uncertainty 
of the patients’ prognosis.8,9 Consequently, t he family and close f riends (i.e. caregivers) of patients 
undergoing HCT are substantially impacted by [CONTACT_102]’s illness. Watching a loved one struggle with the 
side ef fects during H CT can be emotionally challenging.[ADDRESS_632974] may lead to  significant disruption s in the caregiver’s 
personal life , including difficulties in maintaining responsibilities at home and work.10-[ADDRESS_632975] distress immediately before and during their loves ones’ 
Psychological Intervention to Promote Copi[INVESTIGATOR_492176] (HCT)  
Protocol version 1/ [ADDRESS_632976] are a highly vulnerable population with substantial 
caregiving burden that results in significant physical and psychological distress.  
 
Addressing the needs of caregivers  is necessary to improve both patients’ and caregivers’  
outcomes  
 Caregiving burden often leads to substantial negative effects on caregivers’ quality of life (QOL) 
and mood.[ADDRESS_632977] (see preliminary studies), which demonstrates that 
caregivers experience a substantial decl ine in QOL and increase in depression symptoms during the HCT 
process.[ADDRESS_632978] of problem -solving intervention for caregivers after patients’ 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492178].[ADDRESS_632979] been developed to im prove caregivers’  QOL and mood at 
their most challenging times during their loved ones’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492180] [ADDRESS_632980] in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_492181] -specific interv entions to address the specialized needs of caregivers and provide 
them with the necessary skills to care for and cope with their loved ones’ illness.7,8,18-20 While the emerging 
data on caregivers’ interventions are encouraging, poorly de fined interventions and outcome  measures 
have hampered the field substan tially.8,17,[ADDRESS_632981] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_492182] a multicomponent 
psychological intervention to promote effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_492179] -being.8,21 These components 
include 1) a psycho -educational component to enhance preparedness, manage expectations, and develop 
caregiving skills; 2) a psychosocial component to promote copi[INVESTIGATOR_492183]; and 3) a self -care compone nt to enhance positive health behaviors and 
promote their well -being.8,[ADDRESS_632982], we propose a multi -
component p sychological intervention for caregivers . We will utilize mixed qualitative and quantitative 
methods to refine the intervention and to assess its feasibility and preliminary efficacy in improving 
caregivers’ QOL, caregiving burden, mood, and self -efficacy. Our planned intervention is built upon a 
strong methodological foundation and the findings of a rigorous longitudinal study  (see preliminary stud ies), 
which described comprehensively the experi ence patients undergoing HCT and their caregivers during the 
acute phase of transplantation.7,22

 5 Preliminary Studies:  
QOL  and Mood o f Patients and Caregivers  During Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492178]23: We conducted a prospective 
longitudinal study  to investigate the impact of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492184]. We enrolled 95 % (n =90)  of potentially eligible patients undergoing HCT  and 70% of their 
caregivers . We assess ed longitudinal QOL a nd mood both weekly during the  transplant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492185] a follow up outpatient clinic visits, with a missing data rate of only 20% . We demonstrated that caregivers’ 
QOL declined over time , with significant decreases in both physical and mental health. Moreover, we 
showed that caregiver depression symptoms increased dramatically during the HCT hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This 
work demonstrates our research team’s success in conducting longitudinal stu dies in patients  undergoing 
HCT and their caregivers . Additionally, the findings from this work were used to develop a palliative care 
intervention specifically addressing the needs of patients undergoing HCT. Our team utilized the data from 
this study to develop the psychological intervention targeting the specific needs of this population that we 
hope to further refine and test in this project.  
Inpatient palliative care integrated with transplant care improves patient -reported outcomes24: Based upon 
on our prior study describing QOL and mood in patients undergoing HCT,25-27 we developed a palliative 
care intervention targeting the specific needs of this populat ion.  We enrolled 160 of 186 (86%) eligible 
patients in 16 months, with  only one participant withdrawing from the study . Compared to transplant care, 
the palliative care intervention led to a rapid and dramatic improvement in patients’ QOL, depression, 
anxiety, and symptom burden. This work highlights our research team’s experience conducting supportive 
care interventions  targeted to the specific needs of the population,  and our ability to successfully recruit  
and enroll patients with hematologic malignancies for intervention studies.  
3 Objectives  
The objective for Phase 1 of the study is described below.  
 
Objective 1: To refine a multicomponent psychological intervention to promote effective copi[INVESTIGATOR_492186].  
[ADDRESS_632983] Selection:  
During phase 1, we will use qualitative data to refine the mul ticomponent psychological intervention 
specifically targeting the needs of caregivers during their loved ones’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492187] [ADDRESS_632984] consent visit with the patient.  
 
Caregiver s Eligibility C riteria:  
1) Adult caregivers (≥18 years) of patients undergoing HCT at MGH.  
2) A relative or a friend who either lives with the patient or has in -person contact [CONTACT_492200]  
3) Ability to speak English or able to complete questionnaires with minimum assistance of an 
interpreter.  
 
Caregiver s Exclusion C riteria:  
1) Significant uncontrolled psychiatric disorder (psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression) or 
other co -morbid disease  (dementia, cognitive impairment ), which the treating clinician  believes 
prohibits the ability to participate in study procedures . 
Psychological Intervention to Promote Copi[INVESTIGATOR_492176] (HCT)  
Protocol version 1/ [ADDRESS_632985] will  particpi[INVESTIGATOR_492188] 1 of this study.  The 
resear ch team will review the transplant  clinic schedule to identify potentially eligible  caregivers  for study 
participation. We will approach caregivers to participate in phase 1 during the outpatient clinic visi t when 
their loved ones’ consent for HCT, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_14923] [ADDRESS_632986] eligible 
participants’ oncology clinicians to inform them that we plan to approach the caregiver and inquire about 
any concerns regarding their participation. If the clinician objects to the caregivers’ participation, we will 
document the reason and not approach those individuals.  
 
If the oncologist has no concer ns regarding the caregivers’ participation, the research staff will approach 
eligible caregivers immediately after the transplant consent clinic visit. The research assistant (RA) will 
review the consent form with potential participants, which will clearly  detail the  nature of the study 
procedures and the time requirement. T he RA will obtain written informed consent from participants and 
provide them with a copy of the signed consent form.   
 
Enrolled caregivers will complete a baseline self -report questionnaire (Appendix A) at the time of 
obtaining informed consent for the study or within the [ADDRESS_632987] study intervention visit either in -person or via telephone. The RA will be  
responsible for contact[CONTACT_492201] . The ODQ  will require a copy of the caregivers’  informed consent  and 
eligibility checklist.  
5.2 REGISTRATION PR OCEDURES  
5.2.1  Registration process  for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  Registrations

5 Study Design and Methods   
5.1 Design/ Study Type  
During p hase 1 , we will use qualitative data to refine a multicomponent psychological intervention 
specifically targeting the needs of caregivers’ during their loved ones’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492187] 100 days after transplant.  
 
Phase 1 Intervention Refinement : We utilized the findings from our longitudinal study and a thorough 
review of the literature to identify the necessary components of our planned caregiver intervention, as 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071] 1.7,8,21 The preliminary content includes three essential components : 1) a 
psychoeducational component to address preparedness, manage expectations, and develop caregiving 
skills; 2) a psychosocial component focusing on copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], mindfulness, and facilitating acceptance 
while living with uncertainty; and 3) a self -care component to promote caregiver health and well -being. We 
anticipate that the psychological intervention will consist of eight individual sessions (30 -45 minutes each) 
starting prior to admission for HCT and continuing until day + [ADDRESS_632988]. 
Jacobs (a behavioral p sychologist and researcher) will deliver the intervention. [CONTACT_406687] has extensive 
experience as a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_492189] -funded trials. During phase 1, we will refine the intervention based on 
qualitative interviews and feedback from 5 -10 caregivers who will a ttend the psychological intervention 
sessions. We will then finalize the study intervention manual, which will be used in phase 2.

Utilizing data from phase 1 to refine the intervention:  We will utilize the qualitative data obtained from 
phase 1 and clinicians’ experience to finalize the multicomponent psychological intervention. Specifically, 
we will refine the following aspects of the intervention:  
• Intervention c ontent:  We will use caregivers’ feedback to confirm the relevance of the intervention 
content, and to revise content as needed. For instance, if caregiver report that they would have liked 
to focus on more active copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], we will increase the balance bet ween change - and 
acceptance -oriented (e.g., mindfulness) approaches. To further enhance the intervention, we also 
may integrate caregivers’ real -life concerns as examples throughout the protocol when introducing 
the use of copi[INVESTIGATOR_492192].  
• Program structure and schedule:  We anticipate that caregivers will have different needs during 
their loved ones’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492193]. the immediate post -transplant period. However, we will 
use caregivers’ feedback to guide the order and timing of th e eight intervention sessions during these 
two periods. Additionally, we may revise session number (8 sessions) or length (30 -45 min per 
session) based on caregivers’ feedback about participation burden and utility.  
• Program modality:  We will use exit inter view data to determine whether the delivery of the 
intervention visit in -person or over the phone was acceptable to participants.  
• Additional areas of concern:  We will identify any additional areas of concern from caregivers that 
were not addressed specific ally in the intervention and integrate them in a revised intervention 
manual.  
 
5.2 Selection of study instruments  
Baseline questionnaire : During the baseline questionnaire, w e will obtain demographic data including 
age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, relat ionship status,  relationship of the caregiver to the patient,  
education leve l, and annual household income [Appendix A] . 
 
Qualitative interview guide: We will use a semi -structured interview guide  that will explore  1) caregiver  
perception of the acceptability and  content of the intervention; and 2) caregiver  perception s of the 
benefits of receiving the intervention . Facilitators will use probes to obtain comprehe nsive understanding 
of the caregivers’  perspectives.  The semi -struc tured interview guide  is detailed in Appendix B.  The 
interview will last approximately 30 minutes . The participants will not be required to complete any 
additi onal study instruments . The qualitative interview will be conducted in -person or over the telephone  
(Appendix C) . 
 
Training of research coordinator to conduct qualitative interviews:  We will utilize the MGH Cancer 
Outcomes Research Group (CORe) extensive experience training research assistants to conduct semi -
structured qualitative interviews with the use of the interview guide.  The research assistant will first 
complete an initial tr aining with [CONTACT_9457] , a psychologist with extensive experience conducting 
qualitative interviews. They wi ll then conduct mock practice in terviews with the presen ce of both [CONTACT_492205] -
Jawahri (PI) as well as [CONTACT_77108] (co -investigator).  They will be provi ded direct feedback regarding their 
qualitative interview technique.  Lastly, the research assistant will be supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. El -Jawahri , [CONTACT_492206] (a psychologist and co -investigator) or [CONTACT_77108] during their first two qualitative interviews with 
Psychological Intervention to Promote Copi[INVESTIGATOR_492176] (HCT)  
Protocol version 1/ 10 -3-2016

Participants will be asked to be frank and will be reminded that there is no right or wrong answer to any 
question. P articipants will also be reminded that they may refuse to answer any question that they 
choose. Drs. Areej El -Jawahri (Principal investigator), and Jamie Jacobs  (clinical psychologist  and co -
investigator)  will be available to provide support and supervise the qualitative interview process.  
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_632992] will be notified. 
Additionally, we will  offer participants who remain  distress ed an opportunity to meet with either the 
principal investigator ([CONTACT_492207] -Jawahri) or a clinica l psychologist ([CONTACT_406689] , a co -
investigator) to help address their distress . 
 
5.5.4  Compensation : There will be no compensation for participating in this study.

7.1 Study Endpoints : 
7.1.1  Primary Endpoint :   
The primary endpoint of Phase [ADDRESS_632995]  based on the findings from the qualitative data analysis .  
7.2 Sample Size  Calculation :  
We will recruit and consent 5 -10 caregivers  for Phase 1 . Based on our team’s prior qualitative research 
experience, we believe that this sample size will be sufficient to achieve thematic saturation.  
7.3 Analysis Plan:  
Phase 1  Data Analysis and Interpretation: We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the 
demographic and clinical characteristics of the caregivers enrolled in the study. Our planned sample size 
(n = 5 -10) will allow us to collect comprehensive feedback about the intervention and ensure that we 
have sufficient number of participants to achieve thematic saturation . The qualitative component of the 
Psychological Intervention to Promote Copi[INVESTIGATOR_492176] (HCT)

 11 exit int erviews will 1) explore caregiver  perception of the acceptability and  content of the intervention; 
and 2) explore caregiver  perception s of th e benefits of receiving the intervention . We will also evaluate 
the acceptability of the intervention by [CONTACT_492202]. We will analyze the qualitative data from 
the exit interview  according to the NIH -Best Practices for Mixed Methods research i n Health Sciences for 
applicability, preferences, clinical relevance, intervention leng th/timing, and challenges.28 Study staff will 
independently review the qualitative interview transcripts to create a thematic framework for 
interpretation. Two independent coders  (Drs. Jacobs and El -Jawahri)  will independently code the data to 
enhance  validity and credibility, until high reliability is achieved (Kappa >0.080). Discrepancies will be 
resolved by [CONTACT_492203]. Temel, Jacobs, El -Jawahri, and Park .  
We will utilize the qualitative data obtained from phase 1 and clinicians’ experience to finalize the 
multicomponent psychological intervention. Specifically, we will refine the following aspects of the 
intervention:  
• Intervention content:  We will use caregivers’ feedback to confirm the relevance of the intervention 
content, and to revise content as needed. For instance, if caregiver report that they would have liked 
to focus on more active copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], we will increase the balance bet ween change - and

may integrate caregivers’ real -life concerns as examples throughout the protocol when introducing 
the use of copi[INVESTIGATOR_492192].  
• Program structure and schedule:  We anticipate that caregivers will have different needs during 
their loved ones’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492193]. the immediate post -transplant period. However, we will 
use caregivers’ feedback to guide the order and timing of the eight intervention sessions during these 
two periods. Additionally, we may revise session number (8 sessions) or length (30 -45 min per 
session) based on caregivers’ feedback about participation burden and utility.  
• Program modality:  We will use exit intervi ew data to determine whether the delivery of the 
intervention visit in -person or over the phone was acceptable to participants.  
• Additional areas of concern:  We will identify any additional areas of concern from caregivers that 
were not addressed specifical ly in the intervention and integrate them in a revised intervention 
manual.

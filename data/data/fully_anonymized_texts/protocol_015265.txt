Co-Investigators:  With increased patient volumes, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158648]:  15 patients of ages 18- 65 years old with diagnoses of cerebellar 
ataxia  
 
Numbe r of Sites:  TIRR Memorial Hermann TMC and TIRR Kirby [CONTACT_158692]:  [ADDRESS_184314]  Duration:  At least 3 weeks with patients receiving 1 hour and 30 minutes of non-consecutive steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158649].  
 
 
General Information  
€  The study will be a quantitative, prospective case series and data will be collected for about 
four months. Patients from TIRR Memorial Hermann TMC and from TIRR Memorial Hermann Kirby [CONTACT_158693] a cerebellar disease, brain injury, or stroke will be recruited and will receive an intervention consisting of high intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158650] a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. The patientâ€™s Six Minute Walk Test, [ADDRESS_184315], Scale for Assessment and Rati ng of Ataxia (SARA), and Berg Balance Scale will be collected before 
and after  intervention. 
Background Information  
€ Ataxic gait is characterized by a disordered coordination between the head, trunk, and legs. 
This results in impairments in posture, bala nce, and coordination.
1 Motor training and 
potentially motor learning in these patients is limited due to involvement of the cerebellum, which is critical in motor adaptation and learning.
1 
€  Cerebellar ataxia normally manifests itself as decreased coord ination leasing to 
increased fall risk, decreased quality of life, and decreased independence. While disorders such as stroke, TBI, and SCI have a CPG that instructs best practices and interventions, patients with cerebellar involvement do not have the sam e interventional best  practices.  
There is currently low to moderate grade evidence that supports the use of therapeutic exercises for improvement in objective measures such as the SARA and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) in patients with ataxia.
[ADDRESS_184316], and Dynamic Gait Index. However, this study only looks at the feasibility of maintaining high heart rates in patients that receive stationary bicycle training, not walking interventions.
5 A survey of physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158651] 81% of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158652], only 11% of physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158653]: HSC -MH-23-1064 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/05/2024   considered themselves as having expertise in treating patients with ataxia. Additionally, two 
thirds of the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158654] a need for guidelines for treatment of patients with 
ataxia.3 
€ More research needs to be done that specifically examines options for effective therapeutic 
interventions for patients with cerebellar involvement. The  goal of this specific study is  
to examine the effects of high intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158655], including walking speed and endurance in this population. The hypothesis of the study is that there will be a significant improvement in gait outcome measures ([ADDRESS_184317]) in patients who received high- intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158656]. The secondary 
hypothesis is that the SARA score will not be correlated to improvement in functional outcome measures (such as gait and balance measures) in patients who received high-  
intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158656].  
 
 
Objectives  
€  Primary objective: To determine the effects of high intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158657].  
€ Secondary  objectives:  
o Identify the correlations between gait outcome measures and measures of ataxia and 
balance in individuals with cerebellar  ataxia.  
o Determine differences in response to high intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158658] . 
Study Design  
€  The study will be a non- blinded prospective case series performed at TIRR Memorial 
Hermann and TIRR Kirby [CONTACT_158694]. Participants will be recruited if they have an ICD -[ADDRESS_184318] will provide the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158659] a secure e -mail utiliz ing their Memorial Hermann e -mail. The secure e- mail will 
include the patient diagnosis and their room number with no other personal identifiers listed until the patient consents to the research study.  
€  The study sample will be about [ADDRESS_184319] 3-  
4 weeks.  
€ The primary outcomes measured include the [ADDRESS_184320]. These outcome measures will be performed once at baseline and again at week 3.  
€  The secondary outcomes to be measured include the SARA and the Berg Balance 
Scale. These outcome measures will be performed once at baseline and again at week  3. 
Study Population  
€  The sample will consist of all patients with a diagnosis of ataxia who were admitted to 
TIRR TMC Inpatient or TIRR Kirby [CONTACT_158695]. Diagnoses of inclusion will include any pathology that primarily affects the brain/ cerebellum including degenerative  diseases, 
stroke, TBI, posterior fossa tumor, and MS. Additionally patients will be ambulatory at initial evaluation or will have functional ambulation goals at initial evaluation (as noted by [ADDRESS_184321] measures documented as 0). The ages that will be included  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MH-23-1064 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/05/[ADDRESS_184322] 1 
month or greater.  
€  The exclusion criteria include diagnoses that may have cerebellar involvement but without 
cerebellar ataxia as a principal impairment such as autism, down  syndrome,  
schizophrenia, etc. Additionally, patients who are nonambulatory or who are not able to 
participate in high intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158660] (such as cardiac rehabilitation parameters) or due to orthopedic limitations (such as weight bearing parameters) will be excluded from the study.  
€  The subjects will not be directly recruited. Subjects will be referred to do this study before 
or after their initial evaluation if they have an ICD [ADDRESS_184323] a neurologic injury to some part of their  cerebellum  
based off imaging.  
 
Study Procedures  
€  Potential subjects will be referred to the primary investigator upon arrival to TIRR 
Memorial Hermann Inpatient or TIRR Memorial Hermann Kirby [CONTACT_158696], or after their initial evaluation is performed. The evaluating physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158661] a patient is presen ting with physical symptoms of  cerebellar

€  Informed consent will be obtained prior to participation in this study. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_158663] l evaluation or during 
their first physical therapy treatment session. Patients will be given the informed consent document and will be allowed to ask questions regarding the purposes, confidentiality, and procedures of the  study.  
o If consent is obtained,  all consent forms will be collected in a locked cabinet at 
the primary investigatorâ€™s desk. 
€ The Six Minute Walk Test, [ADDRESS_184324], SARA, and BBS will  be recorded at initial 
evaluation and will also be collected by [CONTACT_34351]. 
€ Each individual patient will receive 30 minutes of the high intensity steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158664] 3 
times a week for 3 weeks. Therefore, each participant will receive 9  sessions of high intensity 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158665], for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes by [CONTACT_1758]â€™s conclusion. 
€  Each intervention will occur with either the primary investigator as the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158666]. If another Doctor of 
Physical Therapy is providing care for that patient, they will be instructed by [CONTACT_158697], heart rate monitoring, and blood pressure monitoring in the note. As the intervention is not extremely specific and since it is considered standard of care for patients with stroke, brain injury, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], the primary investigator will not be required to be the only therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158667]. 
€  The intervention will require heart rate monitoring utilizing a â€œPolar H10â€ � heart rate 
monitor, with the goal of reaching moderate to high intensity for 30 minutes during the one hour long therapy intervention. A screenshot of the Polar heart rate data will be taken after each session of monitoring and sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158668] a private folder on a locked computer, with all patient information such as patient name [CONTACT_158705]: HSC -MH-23-1064

€  The treatment intervention will consist of overground walking, treadmill walking (with or 
without bodyweight support), stairs, resisted walking, and all other steppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/ gait training. The goal of treatment will be to increase the intensity of the exercis e safely and to patient 
tolerance.  
€  For safety, patient blood pressure will be monitored before and after each session at the 
very least. In patients with history of hypertension, stroke, or orthostatic hypotension, it  may 
be taken several times through out the intervention. Additionally, the following will all merit 
the intervention to be  stopped:  
 A drop in systolic blood pressure >20 mmHg with the increasing  workload  
 An increase in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or 110 
mmHg,  respectively.  
 Reported chest or arm pain (angina)

Data and Safety Monitoring 
€  For subjects who were not physically active prior to their neurologic injury, with intense 
exercise there is a possibility for increase in cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart 
attack.  
€  Patien ts with premorbid conditions will have close blood pressure and heart rate monitoring 
throughout the session by a skilled Doctor of Physical Therapy. There are physicians  on 
site at TIRR Memorial Hermann in addition to skilled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158672], profuse sweating, headache, and lightheadedness. Patients with chest pain at any point during the study will have exercise immediately discontinued and will have all of their vitals signs including blood press ure, heart rate, and oxygen 
saturation checked on the spot. There are blood pressure cuffs and oxygen saturation monitors throughout all of the gyms and in all of the units at TIRR Memorial Hermann and 
TIRR Kirby  [CONTACT_158694].  
€  However, in the neurologic popul ation that will be receiving the intervention, there is 
greater risk associated with remaining sedentary. Patients who do not receive intensive rehabilitation are at greater risk for pressure injury, deep vein thrombosis, Type [ADDRESS_184327] low cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_106387], which is a well- known risk factor for chronic  diseases.

7. Even though these patients have already had a cardiovascular - 
related event, even with interventions in which they are required to maintain their heart rate at 75 -85% of HR Maximum, there were no increases in adverse  events.
7 
€  Since this population will also be engaging in steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158675], 
there could be potential for increased risk of falls during interventions. However, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158676] (which is where the study will be conducted) are highly experienced in walking interventions for these patie nts and in the prevention of  falls.  
Additionally, most high intensity training steppi[INVESTIGATOR_158677], TBI, and SCI is proven to improve balance and thereby [CONTACT_158700]. 
€  For the more medically complex patients at TIRR inpatient (ie multiple comorbidities), a 
thorough chart review will be performed to ensure patient is not at increased risk of cardiovascular events (previous heart attacks, uncontrolled hypertension, etc). The  Physical  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MH-23-1064 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/05/2024   Medicine and Rehabilit ation Physician will also be asked to clear the patient for participation 
in high intensity training. For patients at Kirby [CONTACT_158696], a chart review and 
medication review will be performed. If patient is at additional risk for cardiovascular event as determined by [CONTACT_158701] 180 or diastolic blood pressure over 100 consistently, then the 
patient primary physician will be contact[CONTACT_158702]. Additionally, blood pressure and heart rate will be obtained before and after the 
intervention for every session. If patient has any signs of headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, double vision, or dysarthria during the treatment intervention, the treatment will be stopped immediately and vitals including blood pressure and heart rate will be taken.  
€  In order to minimize fall risk, there will be a Doctor of Physical Therapy supervising the 
patient throughout the enti re intervention. If the Doctor of Physical Therapy needs to leave 
even to get a blood pressure machine or a towel, the patient will take a seated rest break.  -If 
any unplanned adverse events occur, or if protocol deviations occur, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966] (Kait lin Benjamin) will report these via the iRIS  portal.  
€  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_37105] (Kaitlin Benjamin) will be responsible for reporting Serious  Adverse 
Events and Unanticipated Problems to the IRB. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158678], data collection, management, and 
analyses. The Primary Investigator will perform reviews of all data once every two weeks in order to ensure safety for all patients and to ensure all data is being tracked accurately.  
 
Statistics  
€  Statistic s will be utilized to compare outcome measures before and after the intervention. A 
dependent sample t -test will be used for comparison of pre - and post -intervention outcomes. 
MANOVAs will be utilized in order to determine potential differences in outcomes  in 
patients with different diagnoses (ie groupi[INVESTIGATOR_158679], nature of cerebellar disease) and to compare the four outcome measures that I will utilize. I may also consider doing multiple t -tests or multiple ANOVAâ€™s if the data does n ot meet statistical 
assumptions. However, I would just need to account for increased possibility of type 1 error

€ Sample size will be 15  patients.  
 
Ethics  
€ The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158680].  
€  An informed consent process will occur for all patients participating in this study (with the 
document attached). The consent process will inform the participants about the study, identify the risks and benefits, stress that participation is voluntary, and that the patient may 
choose to partake or stop at any time. The subjects will be informed that the intervention that 
they are getting focuses on intensity, and is already best clinical practice for many neurologic 
conditions. 
€  In order to protect patient privacy, a linking log will be utilized instead of patient names 
linking them to a random number under which their data will be collected and stored 
securely, as per the â€œData handling and record  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].â€�  
o The only person with access to this log will be the primary investigator as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158681].

Quality control and ass urance 
€  In an effort to assure that data is collected accurately, a Polar Heart Rate monitor will be 
used for heart rate monitoring during each  session.  
€  Additionally, only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158682].  
€ There will be no third- party  monitoring.  
€  In order to be sure that data is accurate and consistent, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158683]. Due to the 
extremely high levels of inter -rater reliability of the Six Minute Walk Test, [ADDRESS_184329], SARA, and Berg Balance Scale, there will be high validity with data being collected  by 
[CONTACT_158703].  
€  Self-assessment will be perfo rmed by [CONTACT_158704][INVESTIGATOR_158684]. Therefore, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158685].

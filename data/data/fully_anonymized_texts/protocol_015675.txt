Study Title:  The Safety of Oral Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822] (Eliquis) versus Subcutaneous Enoxaparin (Lovenox) for 
Thromboprophylaxis in Women with Suspected Pelvic Malignancy; a Prospective 
Randomized Open Blinded End-point
 (PROBE) Design
You are being asked to be in a research study.  This form provides you with information about the study. A member of 
the research 
team will describe this study to you and answer all of your questions. Please read the information below 
and ask questions about anything you don’t understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
Why is this study being done?
This study plans to learn more about a new oral medication option (Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) for preventing venous thrombus events 
following gynecologic surgery.  A venous thrombus event is a
 blood clot.  Women having gynecologic surgery for cancer 
have about a 10% risk of a blood clot in the 1-month following surgery. In some, this may be fatal.  Anti-coagulation 
treatment following surgery decreases your risk for blood clots.  
The new medication (Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) will be compared to the current medication Enoxaparin,  which is commonly called 
Lovenox.  Lovenox is an injectable medication taken for 28 days, used to prevent blood clots.  
You are being asked to be in this research study because:
 You are having surgery for your suspected or confirmed gynecologic cancer, 
 You have no history of blood clots, and 
 You have no history of any bleeding disorder.  
Other people in this study
Up t
o 500  people from your area will participate in the study. 
What happens if I join this study?
If you join the study, you will be asked to complete a screening visit where you will provide your  medical history and 
demographic data to the study doctor.  Your medical chart may also be accessed for review of your health history.  The 
study doctor will use this information to determine if you are eligible. 
If you are determined eligible to continue in the study, you will be scheduled  for a pre-operative exam.  This exam will 
be completed as part of your routine clinical care.  In addition to the routine clinical procedures at this visit (pregnancy 
test, physical exam, etc.), you will be asked to complete a survey as part of the research study which will evaluate your 
quality of life.  This should take about 10 minutes to complete.
Either before or after your procedure you will be randomized (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to  receive either the oral study 
medication (Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]) or the current standard of care medication (Enoxaparin).  You will take the medication for [ADDRESS_202363]-operative visit approximately 2 weeks after your surgery.  In  addition to 
the routine clinical procedures at this visit, you will review your diaries and return your empty medication 
bottles/syringes to a member of the study team. Your medical chart will also be accessed for review of your health 
history.  Approximately 28-[ADDRESS_202364] all medication bottles/syringes, unused medication, and a physical exam will be 
conducted.  You will also be asked to complete a survey which will evaluate your quality of life, and your medical chart 
will be accessed for review of your health history.  The survey will take about [ADDRESS_202365] 
your doctor and schedule a clinic visit for evaluation of your symptoms. These symptoms include: pain in leg, warmth in 
skin, visible veins not normally visible, leg fatigue, severe chest pain, or coughing up blood.  If a blood clot is suspected, 
you may be asked to stop taking the study medications and your study participation will end.  
What are the possible discomforts or risks?
Risk of surgical procedure (not study related): Women having
 gynecologic surgery for cancer have about  a 10% risk of a 
blood clot in the 1-month following surgery. In some, this may be fatal. Symptoms of a blood clot include: pain in leg, 
warmth in skin, visible veins not normally visible, or leg fatigue.  Contact [CONTACT_172864].
Risks of study procedures: 
Medication: Like all medicines, Api[INVESTIGATOR_172857].   The negative events that are the most likely to 
happen to you if you receive Api[INVESTIGATOR_172858]. You may not get any of them, but it is important to 
know what to do if they do occur.
Common (between one in ten to one in a hundred patients might experience the event)
oBleeding in the eye, under the skin, from the  nose and gums
oBruising
oVomiting of blood
oBlood in stool and urine
Uncommon (between one in a thousand to one in ten-thousand might  experience the event)
oSensitivity reaction (e.g. skin rash, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face)
oBleeding in the brain, in the lining of the stomach, from the mouth, and from hemorrhoids
oBlood in sputum (nasal and throat mucus)
oAbnormal bleeding from injection sites, sites of cuts, sites  of injury and vaginal 
Rare (between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000)
oBleeding in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_53121] (including the lungs)
These risks are the same if you are assigned to the Enoxaparin group.  Enoxaparin  is not an investigational drug.  
Enoxaparin is the standard of care prescribed to you following gynecologic surgery if you decide not to 
participate.  You would have the same risk as you would if you didn’t participate in the study.

will do all that we can to protect your information, but it can not be guaranteed.
Becoming pregnant: If you become pregnant, the particular treatment or procedures involved in the  study may 
involve risks to the embryo or fetus which are currently unclear. The reproductive risk potential of api[INVESTIGATOR_172859]. Api[INVESTIGATOR_172860].  All subjects 
must agree to use at least one of the following highly effective methods of contraception.  Talk to your doctor about 
the best options for you.   
       The study may include risks that are unknown at this time. 
What are the possible benefits of the study?
This study is designed for the researcher
 to learn more about new medication options for preventing blood clots, 
following gynecologic surgery.   An
 oral medication may provide patients with an easier and more cost-effective option 
for treatment after surgery. 
This study is not designed to treat any illness or to improve your health.  Also, there may be risks, as discussed in the 
section describing the discomforts or risks.
Are there alternative treatments? 
There may be other ways to prevent blood clots after surgery.  The standard of
 care is an anticoagulation medication.  
Some of these medicines are: Heparin, Enoxaparin, or Lovenox.  Treatment is taken daily
 using a self-administered 
injection. You could also choose to get no treatment at all for prevention of blood clots following surgery. 
You should talk to your doctor about your choices.  Make sure you understand  all of your choices before you decide to 
take part in this study.  You may leave this study and still have these other choices available to you. 
Who is paying for this study? 
This research is being paid for by [CONTACT_414]-Meyers Squibb, the manufacturer of the study drug. 
Will 
I be paid for being in the study?  
You will not be paid to be in the study.
 You may be reimbursed for your medication co-pay, or deductible if applicable, 
as indicated below.
Will I
 have to pay for anything?
It will not cost you 
anything to be in the study. Your surgery and the medicines provided to you during surgery will be 
provided per standard of care.  All visits for your gynecologic surgery are standard of 
care and will be billed to your 
insurance in the normal manner.  If you are randomized to receive the current standard of care medication (Enoxaparin), 
you may be charged a co-payment for the medication, or a pharmacy charge if you have an applicable deductible which 
has not yet been met.  This will be dependent on your insurance plan.  You will be reimbursed the total amount of this 
co-pay or pharmacy charge.  If you are randomized to receive the study medication (Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]), you will receive the 
medication free of charge.

Taking part in this study is voluntary.  You  have the right to choose not to take part in this study.  If you choose to take 
part, you have the right to stop at any time.  If you refuse or decide to withdraw later, you will not lose any benefits or

 Page 3 of 24 1.0 Objectives  1.1 The overall objectives of the research grant are listed below; patients and providers will be involved in the data collection for Aims 1 & 2 whereas Aim 3 & [ADDRESS_469622] any patient involvement and will assess costs of implementation from a system standpoint and plans for dissemination:  Aim 1: Test the effectiveness of an EHR-based Medication Complete  Communication (EMC2) strategy, with and without SMS text reminders to   improve patient understanding and use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007].  Aim 2: Evaluate the fidelity of the EMC2 Strategies and explore patient, provider, and health system barriers to the implementation and effectiveness of either intervention.  Aim 3: Assess the costs required to deliver the interventions, exclusive of system design.   Aim 4: Develop a dissemination plan for the EMC2, with any necessary  modifications, to other emergency departments and relevant medical practices.  1.[ADDRESS_469623] (EHR) based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) strategy will reduce medication errors with newly prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_375304]. Compared to those receiving usual care, patients receiving the EMC2 strategies will:   H1 Report higher rates of provider (physician and pharmacist) counseling H2 Have a greater understanding of risks associated with newly prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]   H3 demonstrate more appropriate safe use of prescribed high-risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] 2.[ADDRESS_469624] labeling,  such as the package insert, container label, or medication

 Page [ADDRESS_469625] been designed to inform  individuals on the safe, appropriate use of a prescribed(Rx)  medication - including risks and warnings – are limited in their   effectiveness. Even when evidence-based practices are employed   to develop these written communications, those with limited  literacy and numeracy skills - and older adults - may remain at  greater risk for poor understanding and medication errors.13-[ADDRESS_469626] decade, there has been a  marked increase of opi[INVESTIGATOR_375305] a corresponding   increase in the number of deaths from both opi[INVESTIGATOR_375306].16-20 In 2008, opi[INVESTIGATOR_375307] 74% of all deaths from prescription drug overdose.16  Widely variable and often inadequate patient counseling about this  class of medications may contribute to this, especially in the  Emergency Department (ED) where pain is the most  common complaint and opi[INVESTIGATOR_375308].21-26 39% of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_375309], yet both spoken and written counseling is minimal.27-29 At the national level, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) endorse health system  interventions targeting long-acting and extended release opi[INVESTIGATOR_375310].17,[ADDRESS_469627] the ability to impart risk information to individuals at multiple time  points  and via multiple modalities. We will implement an EHR-based, Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) strategy, wherein 1)  emergency physicians adequately counsel patients at the time of prescribing, 2) tangible tools reinforce counseling, and 3) a mechanism for follow-up engages additional providers to reinforce education and confirm understanding.  3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  3.1 Screening for eligibility for study Emergency Department Providers. The research study will be described to providers by [CONTACT_375340], both via email and at in-person business meetings. All ED providers 
EHR-Based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) Strategy to Promote Safe Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536]: A Physician Randomized Trial  
 Page 5 of 24 (attending MD, resident MD, NP, PA) with the exception of study investigators will be eligible. Providers will be asked to complete a written consent form if they choose to be involved in the study.   Patients. During the patient recruitment period, the RA will make frequent rounds through the ED and ask physicians to identify potentially eligible patients who will be discharged home on opi[INVESTIGATOR_83221].  The RA also will carry a pager so that physicians can notify the RA if they have an eligible patient.  This method of patient identification has a well-established track record within our ED for maximizing enrollment while minimizing RA downtime. If the patient is interested in participating or learning more about the study, the RA will obtain verbal permission to ask the patient a brief series of questions to determine eligibility (see criteria below).  If the patient is eligible for the study, the RA will proceed with obtaining written informed consent.  Follow-up Providers. Certain providers will interact with consented patients after the intervention takes place (e.g. Primary care physicians (PCP) and outpatient pharmacists).  These providers will have no required role in carrying out the intervention (which is carried out by [CONTACT_375341]).  These providers will be identified by [CONTACT_14716] (PCP) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_375311] (pharmacists) at the time of patient follow-up.  <30% of ED patients have on-staff PCP and there is no way to predict where the patients will fill their prescriptions (e.g., on-site Walgreens or another pharmacy).  After identifying these providers at the time of follow-up, we will contact [CONTACT_375342] a survey.  Both types of surveys will be offered to accommodate providers’ busy schedules and because the pharmacists are located at diverse locations across the across the city of Chicago.   The survey will assess the implementation of the EHR interventions and the providers’ reactions to receiving additional information about their patients who were prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_375312].    3.2 ED Provider Inclusion Criteria. 1) Resident, Attending Physician or Mid-level provider (NP, PA) working in the Northwestern Emergency Department during study dates.  ED Provider Exclusion Criteria. 1) Study investigator.  Patient Inclusion Criteria. To be eligible to enroll and remain in the study, patient subjects must meet all of the following criteria: 1) Patient age 18 years and older, 2) English language speaking  3) prescribed pi[INVESTIGATOR_375313]-acetaminophen opi[INVESTIGATOR_256347] 4) the patient is the person primarily responsible for administering medication   Patient Exclusion criteria.  Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following conditions are met: 1) Aged <18, 2) non-English

Actual use of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_375317], participant report of refills and new opi[INVESTIGATOR_375318]-ended questions at the time of follow-up phone interview; patient risky-behaviors while on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], as measured by [CONTACT_18654]-report. Other aspects of safe use related to risk awareness will be assessed using a questionnaire, as will beliefs about medication use.  The questionnaire will assess topi[INVESTIGATOR_375319], sharing of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], disposal on completion of the prescription, and questions related to possible dangerous behaviors. Secondary endpoints will be assessed with phone interviews .  Tertiary Endpoints. The identification of medication names, dosage, risks, warnings, and benefits will be assessed through a structured questionnaire that has been developed and used extensively by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wolf and colleagues in multiple studies and current NIH-funded grants.  The self-report of provider counseling will also be measured. Tertiary endpoint assessments will be assessed via phone interviews.   Exploratory Endpoint. A subset of analyses will examine return visits to the ED (obtained via EDW query) and admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a complaint related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_256347] (ranging from mild, e.g., constipation to severe, e.g., respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]). Additional analyses will be conducted to evaluate for possible misuse or inappropriate prescribing.  Outcome indicators include: 1) opi[INVESTIGATOR_375320] (defined as opi[INVESTIGATOR_375321] 7 or more days, including refills), 2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_375322], 3) long acting/extended release opi[INVESTIGATOR_375323] 4) high daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_375324] (defined as a prescribed daily dose of 100 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) or greater) and 5) opi[INVESTIGATOR_375325] (measured as having a 50% or greater increase in mean MME per month twice during the year).91,92 These data will be obtained by a data pull via the Illinois

[CONTACT_32246], blinded to provider identity will randomly assign  providers within each stratum to each of three study arms using a random  number generator.  We will reveal provider identities after randomization  is complete.    Provider role and training. All providers will be informed of the possible interventions that their patients may receive (e.g., Universal Medication Schedule sig codes (See below on page 9), Medication Sheet, Text reminders, and emails to PCP as well as any changes such randomization may cause to the providers workflow (i.e, for some providers, intermittent pop-ups reminding them to counsel patients).  Providers will be told that they will be assigned to either the usual care or one of two intervention groups. The providers who are assigned to the intervention groups will be trained on how to 1) prescribe medications with the EMS instructions from the “favorites” list and 2) how the other components of the intervention will automatically generate (MedSheet, emessage to PCP).   The initial study visit (baseline) will be conducted at the time of patient enrollment.  Following this baseline interview, RAs will conduct three telephone interviews (at 2-[ADDRESS_469632]-baseline).  The first two assessments (at enrollment and 2-4day follow-up call) have been included to closely track patient recall of counseling and knowledge, while the latter two assessments (7-14 day follow-up call and 1 month follow-up call) are included to assess decay of knowledge, safe use, storage of medications and demonstrated dosing.  The final call (one month post-baseline) will assess disposal of

The final study phone call will be conducted at a time of convenience for the patient, however still within 1-month post-baseline. (See Attached Interview script)  Intervention Patients with physicians randomized to the EMC2 arm will receive the 5-part EMC2 intervention.    [1] Funded by [CONTACT_229335] [R18HS17220], we created single-page, plain language medication information sheets with content appropriately sequenced from a patient’s perspective (drug name, indication, purpose/benefit, how to take, for how long, when to call your doctor, when to stop taking and call your doctor, important information) and following other health literacy best practices.   [2] The medication sig (‘sig’ is short for signa, which in Latin means “write”) contains directions to the patient (e.g.: “take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_375328] 8 hours). We have shown that we are able to replace existing EHR default sigs for the top 300 medicines prescribed in primary care with UMS instructions [R21CA132771] and have evaluated the use of UMS sigs in actual pharmacy practice [R01HS017687] for non-PRN medications.  The UMS sig for PRN medications has been evaluated in two studies ([LOCATION_004] Healthcare Foundation, McNeil Consumer Healthcare), and we have found that patients with the UMS sig for PRN dosing (Take-Wait-Stop label) were less likely to exceed the maximum daily recommended 
EHR-Based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) Strategy to Promote Safe Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536]: A Physician Randomized Trial  
 Page 10 of 24 dose of their opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447].  The UMS Sig for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_375329] 1              [3] In addition to the tools that the patient receives, the EHR will automate communication to the patient’s prescribing ED physician, reminding them to counsel the patient with a pop-up window.    [4] Additionally, there will be communication to the dispensing pharmacist by [CONTACT_7328] a note on the paper-prescription requesting the pharmacist consider counseling the patient.  [5] Finally, there will be a notification to the primary care physician (PCP) if the patient has a PCP in the Northwestern system.  This notification was initially conceptualized as being automated when the inpatient and outpatient Cerner systems were compatible.  Since the switch of the outpatient Northwestern Medicine offices to the EPIC EHR, this automated function is not longer available.  Therefore, the RAs enrolling the subjects will note if the patient has a Northwestern Medicine physician.  If the patient enrolled for follow-up has a physician in the system, the RA will manually log-in to the outpatient EPIC interface (with write functionality) and send the PCP an inbox message with the following sample text: “Your patient NAME, DOB was seen in the Northwestern Emergency Department on MONTH DATE, 20XX.  They received a prescription for Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen (DOSE, TIMING, NUMBER OF TABS).  When you see this patient for a follow-up appointment, please consider counseling them about the safe use of this medication.  For additional information about your patient’s visit to the Emergency Department, you may access the Emergency Department Note and Depart Summary.  The Depart Summary will also contain a copy of the information sheet that your patient received about their new prescription pain medication.”

 Page 11 of 24 [Note: Neither the Pharmacist nor the PCP receiving the messages to “consider counseling the patient” are required to take any action as part of the intervention.  The study is designed with the ED as point of care and we will be assessing implementation to gauge the response to these messages among those PCPs and pharmacist who received them; however, these providers are not required to do anything as part of the study or intervention.]  Patients with ED physicians randomized to the EMC2 +SMS Text reminder arm will receive the above-described 5 components of the EMC2 intervention, and also will receive daily text reminders for one week (7 messages) following the new prescription for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_256347] (only consented patients).  The premise for the 1-week timeframe is to help patients remember precautions regarding safe use during the time they are taking the medication (average ED Rx for opi[INVESTIGATOR_375330] 18 tabs). Furthermore, SMS text reminders that would continue indefinitely are at risk for either being ignored, irritating patients, and/or adding an unnecessary expense to patients (i.e., patient does not have an unlimited texting plan, further challenging sustainability). Messages sent early in the week will focus on topi[INVESTIGATOR_375331]; those sent near the end of the week will focus on topi[INVESTIGATOR_375332].  We will schedule EMC2 text messages to arrive mid-day (12:00pm to 5:00pm), based on patient preference. (See appendix for sample text messages)  9.[ADDRESS_469639] a set protocol to follow.  (see safety protocol attached) 9.4  The drug hydrocodone-acetaminophen is the topic of the research; however it is not being used in the research—the intervention is focused on education about this medication and the study will not change the drug, dose, frequency, quantity or refills that the ED physician selects in the course of their normal clinical care.     Sources of Materials:  Electronic Health Record (EHR): Patient information and outcomes will be extracted from the EHR (demographics, ED return visits and re-admissions).  Re-admissions and re-visits to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375333], as well as all patients prescribed an opi[INVESTIGATOR_375334] 18-months.

 Page 12 of 24 Illinois Prescription Monitoring Program (ILPMP): We will obtain data from the ILPMP on medication fill date, subsequent refills of the prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], and new prescriptions for other controlled substances.   All personal health information will be kept behind organizations’ firewalls.  Analytic databases will be created with removal of all personal health information; these will then be sent to Northwestern investigators for analysis.  Patient in-person enrollment & follow-up phone interviews:  Interviews include assessments of health literacy skills, safe medication use, and medication understanding, among others.  Provider surveys: Both the ED providers and the follow-up providers (PCP and Pharmacists) will be surveyed to assess their reactions to the intervention via electronic and mail survey.  10.0 Data and Specimen Banking 10.1 Data will be stored for up to 5 years after study completion for data analysis and publication of study results.  At that time, all identifiers will be destroyed, but de-identified data will be retained.  Data will be stored on Northwestern encrypted servers and access will be granted through the PI.  10.2 The clinical data, interview data and prescription refill data noted above will be stored. 10.3 Data will not be released. 11.0 Data and Specimen Management 11.1 AIM 1 Analysis Plan. The proposed trial uses a cluster-randomized design where the prescribing physician is the unit of randomization. We will randomize approximately 150 physicians (50 attending physicians, 100 EM resident physicians and mid-level providers) to three intervention arms (usual care, EMC2, and EMC2 + SMS text reminders).  The estimate of 150 includes a base of 100 providers with an estimate of approximately 50 new providers over the course of the 18 months of recruitment (e.g. 15 new residents in 2015, 15 new residents in 2016 and new attending hires). At any given time, we estimate that 100 providers will be actively involved in the study, resulting in approximately 33-34 physicians per arm. Physicians will be stratified by [CONTACT_375344] (i.e., attending vs. resident) and randomly assigned to one of the three arms with an equal number assigned to each.  We will accrue approximately 12 patients per physician; we conservatively anticipate at least 54% retention for the phone call follow-up 7-[ADDRESS_469640] prescription.  These estimates will result in 1500 participants recruited with an anticipated 
EHR-Based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) Strategy to Promote Safe Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536]: A Physician Randomized Trial  
 Page 13 of 24 minimum of 816 patients at in-person follow-up (272 per arm, 8 per physician) available for primary data analysis.    To ensure adequate balance across the 3 arms, potential confounders including socio-demographic characteristics, comorbidities, regimen complexity (i.e., # of medications, total pi[INVESTIGATOR_71678]), health literacy level, and history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) will be compared using one-way ANOVA models and χ2 tests, as appropriate. Covariates with significant differences (p-value < .05) across treatment groups will be included in the generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to adjust for the group differences as described below. We note that detected differences may be physician-specific, so if we observe differences across the treatment arms, we will explore whether the difference might be attributable to individual physicians.   Demonstrated safe use by [CONTACT_375345] 1 (H3), with higher reported rates of provider counseling and greater understanding of risks relevant to hypotheses of secondary interest for Aim 1 (H1, H2). We will use GLMMs for analyses of the data, specifying the logit link function for the binary outcomes using xtmixed in Stata (v.12.1). The 3-category treatment group variable will be the independent variable of primary interest and modeled as a fixed effect with the usual care group specified as the reference. We will also include fixed effects for any potential confounding covariates noted in the descriptive studies that were not accounted for in randomization. Random effects will be included for each physician to account for intra-physician correlation among participants. For all GLMM analyses we will report point estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  We will examine and report the extent to which the random effects suggest correlation of outcomes within physicians.   Measures taken to minimize bias. For the randomization scheme of this study, physician is the unit of randomization rather than patient. With healthcare interventions and quality improvement projects, such as the one proposed herein, there are no other ways to evaluate an automated EHR process than to “turn them on.”  This is why the randomization will occur at the physician level rather than the patient level.  This process will result in trickle down of aspects of the EMC2 intervention (but not SMS texting) to patients seen by [CONTACT_71693], but not enrolled in the study for follow-up purposes (e.g., on overnight shifts).   Level of significance to be used. We will use a two-sided 5% significance test  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. We will stop enrollment once we have reached the 1500 patient enrolled maximum.

 Page 14 of 24  Procedures for reporting deviations from the original plan.  Any deviations involving human subjects will be submitted to the IRB for review before being implemented.  Selection of subjects for inclusion in the analysis. All subjects with complete information (e.g., at least 80% completion of interview instrument) will be used in the analysis.  AIM 2 Analysis Plan. Following completion of enrollment, we will determine the extent to which the interventions were implemented as planned (a process evaluation) in the two intervention arms. In the EMC2 and EMC2 + SMS text reminder arms, we will collect EHR data on prescriptions and discharge summaries to assess if patients actually received the new prescriptions with the UMS (Take-Wait-Stop) sig, and review pi[INVESTIGATOR_375335] 7-14 day phone call to determine if the sigs were translated accordingly onto patients’ drug labels. For the EMC2 + SMS text reminder arm, we will ask patients at all follow-up intervals if they received the text messages. For those electing to turn off the service, we will qualitatively explore and code reasons why.    Usability of the EHR interventions will be assessed among the ED physicians and follow-up providers (PCPs and pharmacists) via survey.  AIM [ADDRESS_469641] of the interventions relative to usual care from the perspective of the ED implementing these systems. The primary costs of running the EMC2 intervention involve the limited expenses around printing (printer ink, paper, staff time).  However, we will include estimates for minimal programming maintenance and will test the sensitivity of results to changes in the maintenance requirements in terms of programmer hours. We also will separately track development costs for software and other programming requirements based on programmer hours.  The greater cost, in terms of running the program, will be that for the SMS text services, which will include the nominal monthly cost as well as staff time to schedule the SMS text reminders after the initial ED visits. For study purposes, the RA will do this task; however, we will have record on a daily basis in a study database (Microsoft Office Access, Microsoft Corp.) the number of minutes spent programming the SMS text reminders. This record will allow us to estimate the direct staff costs of this component by [CONTACT_375346].  We will test the sensitivity of costs to different assumptions about the potential use of variable staff (nurse, clerk, medical assistant) using different salaries but assuming the same proficiency in terms of time required.  Further we will assess the sensitivity of the 
EHR-Based Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) Strategy to Promote Safe Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5536]: A Physician Randomized Trial  
 Page 15 of 24 estimates to different proficiency levels that could arise from learning by [CONTACT_7087].  To achieve Aim 3, Surrey Walton, at UIC, will help in analyzing time and resource use related to the intervention.  Any data that he would receive would be anonymous and would not contain any patient PHI.  Instead, the data would involve counts of hours spent, and materials used, in creating and implementing the intervention.  11.2  Rationale for choice of sample size, power considerations. The sample size for this study was based on pairwise comparisons between the two intervention arms compared to usual care (i.e., usual care vs. EMC2 and usual care vs. EMC2 + SMS). This calculation was based on the primary outcome of demonstrating safe use by [CONTACT_375347] 7-14 day phone follow-up interview.   Conservatively estimating 54% retention rate for 7-[ADDRESS_469642] 82% to detect a difference of 11.8% between each intervention and the usual care arm assuming a Type I error of 2.5% to account for the two comparisons.  An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.[ADDRESS_469643] 80% power, a Type 1 error rate of 2.5%, an ICC of 0.001, and usual care estimates from prior studies.   11.[ADDRESS_469644], will be kept strictly confidential. In order to preserve participants’ confidentiality rights, research subjects will be assigned study ID numbers that will be used to identify all the information collected. A master study tracking database will contain information linking participants to their study ID numbers. This database will be on RedCap and is both encrypted and password protected and only accessible by [CONTACT_375348]. Grant file access permissions will only be given to specific approved research personnel, as designated by [CONTACT_978].  12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects

No individual administration of any therapeutic or prophylactic agent is required in this protocol and there are no procedures required by [CONTACT_760]. However, because this study does involve interview questions related to the use of a medication, namely hydrocodone/acetaminophen, safety measures will be in place to detect any unsafe medication use by [CONTACT_148868]. These adverse events may occur during the course of the study period from overdose (whether accidental of intentional), from abuse, from concomitant use with other products (sedatives or acetaminophen) and from withdrawal.  The research assistants conducting the phone interviews and completing review of the medication diaries will have a protocol in place to identify any concerning medication use patterns with an action plan outlined if events are detected.  (See attachment)   It is the expectation of the investigator that because this study is a non-invasive behavioral intervention that most, if not all, adverse events are unlikely or definitely not related to study participation or the intervention.  These adverse events will be reported annually as part of regular data reporting. If any adverse events are serious or potentially study related, they would be reported as required in the time period required by [CONTACT_1201].  13.[ADDRESS_469646] decides to withdraw from the study, there will be instructions in the consent document (all patients provided signed copy) with information regarding contact[CONTACT_375349] [INVESTIGATOR_375336].

It is possible that subjects may feel shame and/or some emotional discomfort when taking the literacy and medication use assessments, and performing medication related tasks. We will also be making changes to how their medication instructions are written, and learning through follow-up interviews how they are implementing regimens. If we find that patients in any study arm are misusing medications, we will have a structure in place to address these concerns. This will be documented accordingly within internal study documents; however will not become a part of the medical record unless patients require acute care for their drug misuse or abuse. Consent forms will also acknowledge this disclosure. Patients in one study arm will receive automated text messages that some could view as intrusive; however they will have the ability to opt-out of the messages at any time.  With SMS texting via cell phones, only the phone number is entered into the automated texting system, and no other patient information. We will uphold patient confidentiality and respect any requests to turn off this function during the study.  Subjects will be informed that participation in any part of this research study may result in a loss of privacy, since persons other than the investigators may view their study records if deemed necessary for oversight purposes. However, they will be identified by a unique identification number (“study number”), not by [CONTACT_2300], and any other identifying information (e.g. personal and/or contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be kept separate from the other data; All information will be kept in secure, password protected files. Further, subjects will be told that unless required by [CONTACT_2371], only the study investigators, members of the project staff, and representatives of the Northwestern University or clinic Institutional Review Boards will have the authority to review any study records. In such case, they too will be required to maintain confidentiality.   15.[ADDRESS_469648], as a result of this study, a better functional understanding of their opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536].

We have significant experience in recruiting patients from the emergency department, conducting studies related to medications (including the medication being studied), consenting patients to follow-up, and conducting multi-part follow-up with both in-person and telephone interviews. Additionally, the team has experience in managing data in accordance with the best-practices of the IRB to protect patients’ confidentiality.   20.[ADDRESS_469649] that approximately 9,000 subjects will be potentially eligible for follow-up annually (representing 16% of discharged patients from the ED).

Participants’ consent will be documented by [CONTACT_375354]. Subjects will be provided with a copy of the consent. They may withdraw at any time during the study without penalty or loss of any healthcare benefit or service to which they are entitled.  Patients who state that they do not want to receive further communication via SMS text-messaging will have the opportunity to cancel the text messages and not receive further outreach; they will be included in outcome assessments.   Data from the Illinois Prescription Monitoring Database will be obtained via individual patient record query for the enrolled patients.  No protected health information will not be sent outside of Northwestern or to the State for a database query.    Patients will be assigned a unique identification number; The research database will be password protected and accessible only to the research team. Information linking subjects with their unique identifier will be kept on a separate password-protected desktop computer in a locked office within the Department of Emergency Medicine. We believe that in using these methods we will be compliant with the “Standards for Privacy of Individual Identifiable Health Information” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.

Finally, they will be informed about the follow-up components for the study, consisting of 3 phone calls (at 2-4 days, 7-14 days and 1 month).  The patients will complete a written informed consent document and will be given a copy of the consent document.  See consent document. They will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and given contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_32528].    Non-consenting patients.  Subjects in this study are consenting to follow-up; however, as mentioned above, because of the nature of implementing the EHR-based intervention at the system level, it is possible that patients who are seen after hours (outside of RA availability) will receive the EHR components of the intervention without being approached for consent or enrolled in the study. Note, that any patient not enrolled in the study and not providing written consent will not be called to ask to participate in follow-up visits or phone calls.  We believe that were a patient to see an enrolled physician and thus potentially receive the EHR-components of the intervention, that the patient would not be exposed to any additional risk as the physician-facing interventions (e.g. EHR alert) are educational and do not change the prescribing practices of the physician.  Changes to the care delivery of the ED as a result of the intervention should be perceived as an exploratory quality improvement activity, and therefore reasonable that some patients may be exposed to new, available services as part of the study.  We will only examine data on outcomes that can be collected in aggregate and not from patient interviews (specifically, we will examine, via the EDW, return visits to the emergency department).  There is no collection of PHI, rather a comparison of already available ED data between study arms.   Follow-up providers. The PCPs and pharmacists identified by [CONTACT_375355][INVESTIGATOR_375338] a survey gauging their responses to the intervention which their patients received. These providers will be asked to document their consent by [CONTACT_71723] “I agree” box (on the electronic version of the survey) or by [CONTACT_71724] (paper version of the survey).

 Page 23 of 24 Written informed consent will be obtained from ED physicians (both attending and resident physicians). All participants will be told that their participation is voluntary; they can stop at any time, and whether they participated or not will not be disclosed to their superiors.  Their participation in the EHR-based intervention will be kept confidential and made anonymous in reports.  If the physician does not want to participate or decides to stop before completing the 18-month patient enrollment period, this will not be disclosed to any superiors.    Patients The intervention is implemented at the physician level.  Therefore patients will be recruited for follow-up purposes only, rather than for consent to the EHR portion of the intervention.  For patients consenting to follow-up, the consent will be documented in writing.  For those patients receiving the intervention on the basis of having a consented provider, but not approached or consented for follow-up, we request a waiver of informed consent because: 1) this is a low-risk study, in particular, it is research designed to evaluate an educational strategy, 2) it would not be feasible to conduct the study as intended if obtaining individual informed consent were necessary (in this case because patients do not become eligible until a prescription is written for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]—but a key component of the intervention is the text on the prescription), 3) informed consent from each participant would threaten the scientific validity of the study (in this case it would be impossible to evaluate real-world dissemination and implementation of the intervention if the EHR automations needed to be turned on and off at the individual patient level) and 4) for the patients receiving the intervention, but not completing follow-up, no patient data are collected that would not be routinely collected in usual care without consent. Specifically, the only data that will be accessed on this sample of patients is demographic data from the electronic medical record and data on return visits to the emergency department and re-admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375339]/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].    As detailed above, this specific strategy of “turning on” an EHR intervention with physician or clinic level randomization has been previously approved by [CONTACT_375356] (P01HS021141-01, 1U19HS021093-01 & 1R18HS017220-01).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 6of 74 Template 18.0STUDY DESIGN
Study D5290C00008 is a Phase 2, open -label, uncontrolled, single -dose study, planned to be conducted in 
South Af rica, the U nited States, and the E uropean Union, in addition to Japan, where the study in currently 
ongoing, to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, occurrence of ADA, and efficacy of nirsevimab in 
immunocompromised children who are ≤[ADDRESS_1000953] POPULATION
Neonates, infants, and young children ≤[ADDRESS_1000954] RSV season will receive a single fixed IM dose of nirsevimab 50 mg if body 
weight < 5 kg or 100 mg if body weight ≥ 5 kg (n = ~ 50), and subjects entering their second RSV season will 
receive a s ingle fixed IM dose of nirsevimab 200 mg (n = ~ 50).
STATISTICAL METHODS 
Sample Size
A total of approximately 100 subjects are planned to receive a single IM dose of nirsevimab to evaluate the 
safety, PK, ADA, and efficacy, which will be assessed descriptively. The originally proposed sample size of 
30 was based on a similarly designed pal ivizumab study in a similar population, and it is expected to be 
sufficient in establishing a PK profile that allows extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2b 
(D5290C00003) and Phase 3 (  studies in healthy preterm and term inf ants to the target 
immunocompromised population. The updated sample size of 100 allows for the collection of data from a 
larger , global cohort of immunocompromised children with different underlying conditions .
 
 
Statistica l Analyses
There are 2 planned analyses for this study: an interim analysis and a final analysis. The interim analysis will 
be conducted when subjects enrolled globally by [CONTACT_87600] [ADDRESS_1000955] visit of the study (ie, Day 361). 
Data will be summarized for the overall study population , as well as for Japan only .
Safety Analyses
Adverse events will be graded according to the current version of the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events where applicable for pediatric assessments. AEs will be coded 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Re gulatory  Activities ,and the type, incidence, severity, and 
relatio nship to investigational product will be summarized. Other safety assessments will include the 
occurrence of AESIs defined as AEs of immediate hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), 
thrombocytopenia, and immune complex disease (eg, vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerulonephritis) 
following investigational product administration, and the occurrence of NOCDs following investigational 
product administration.

1.1 Disease Background
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_404216] (RSV) is the m ost com mon cause o f lower respi [INVESTIGATOR_618503] (LRTI) among infants and young children, result ing in annual epi[INVESTIGATOR_316676] 
(Hall et al, 2009 ; Shay et al, 1999 ; Shi et al , 2017 ; Stockm an et al , 2012 ). All children, 
including healthy term infants, are at risk for severe RSV lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_732590] . Ninety  percent of children are infected with RSV in 
the first 2 y ears of life, and up to 40 % of those will have LRTI (Greenough et al, 2001 ; 
Meissner, 2003; Parrott et al, 1973 ). RSV LRTI, characterized predominant ly as b ronchi olitis 
or pneumonia, represents a serious illness with acute and perhaps long -term consequences to 
the developi[INVESTIGATOR_732591] y oung children (Blanken et al , 2013 ). It is estimated that RSV 
causes up to 90% of childhood bronchio litis and up to 40% of pediatric pneumo nias (Hall, 
2001) . In 2015, an estimated 33.1 millio n (uncertaint y range, 21.6 to 50.3 millio n) new 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_498905]- associ ated LRTI occurred worldwide in children < 5 y ears of age (28% of 
LRTI epi [INVESTIGATOR_1841]), wi th approximately 3.2 millio n (range, 2.7 to 3.8 millio n) epi[INVESTIGATOR_732592], leading to 59,600 (range, 48,000 to 74,500) in -hospi [INVESTIGATOR_241900] 
(Shi et al, 2017) . Children < 1 y ear of age had an estimated 2.3 millio n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76114]. 
The overall mortalit y due to RSV LRTI was estimated to be as high as 118,200 (uncertaint y 
range, 94,600 to 149,400) (Shi et al, 2017) .
Children with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and those 
receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for severe RSV -associ ated LRTI 
with prolonged vi ral shedding and higher viral loads (Resch et al, 2009 ), resul ting in 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509] (11.5 to 24 days), admissio ns to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 
the need for mechanical ventilat ion (Asner et al , 2013 ; Manzoni et al, 2017 ; Moyes et al , 
2013) . Am ong immunocom promised children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151450], ICU admissio n rates of 
19% or higher have been reported (Asner et al, 2013 ; Rowan et al, 2018
). In addit ion, 
RSV- associ ated m ortalit y rates can reach 60% in untreated children wit h immunodeficiencies , 
compared to a m ortalit y rate of  less than 0.5% in healthy infants with RSV (Asner et al , 2013 ).
Prevent ion of RSV illness in all infants is a major public healt h priority. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_468965] (Kim H. W. et al , 1969 ), there is no licensed 
vaccine for these children. Current ly, the primary management of RSV -associ ated LRTI 
includes supportive c are such as supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilat ion. Other 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_732593], but their effect iveness remains unclear (Asner et al, 2013 ; Kim 
E. et al, 2014 ; Rowan et al, 2018) . 
Palivizumab (Synagis®) is the only approved agent for RSV prophylaxis, and its use is limited 
internati onally  to hi gh-risk children: preterm infants ≤ 35 weeks gestational age (GA),

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 15of 74 Template 18.0children with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity  (also known as bronchopulmo nary 
dysplasia), and children wit h hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD). In 
Japan, palivizumab received approval in 2013 for an addit ional indicat ion in children 
≤ 24 months of age with immunocompro mised medical condit ions or Down syndrome. 
Approval o f this new indicat ion was based on an open -label study  that eval uated the efficacy, 
pharmacokinet ics (PK), and safet y of palivizumab in 28 immunocom promised Japanese 
children. In that study , the serum trough concentratio ns were co mparable with 
Western -approved, indicated pediatric populat ions and Japanese -approved, indicated pediatric 
popul ations (preterm infants and children wit h bronchopulmo nary dysplasia or 
hemodynamically significant CHD) (Mori etal, 2014 ). A larger postmarketing surveillance 
study  with 312 Japanese children ≤ [ADDRESS_1000967] ive 
in this populat ion (Kashiwagi et al, 2018) . However, because its half -life (t 1/2) is 
approxi mately 1 mo nth, infants and young children need to receive monthly intramuscular 
(IM) doses of palivizumab throughout the RSV season to maintain protection. This const itutes 
a significant burden on healt hcare providers as well as the infants/children and t heir families.
1.2 Nirsevimab Background
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) is briefly described belo w. Refer to the current Invest igator’s 
Brochure for details. 
Nirsevimab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa monoclonal ant ibody  
(mAb) di rected against the prefusio n conform ation of the RSV F protein. The ant ibody  has 
been engineered wit h a triple amino acid subst itution (YTE; M257Y/S259T/T261E 
[M252Y/S254T/T256E, according to the European Union { EU numbering system }) in the 
fragment cry stallizable (Fc) region to prolong the t 1/2, whi ch is expected to provide protection 
from serious RSV disease for the duration of the RSV season. Nirsevimab neutralize s RSV by 
[CONTACT_732667] o f the RSV F protein at a site distinct from that bound by  
[CONTACT_316755]. In nonclinical studies, nirsevimab was > 150-fold more poten t than palivizumab 
in 
vitro and approximately  9-fold more potent than palivizuma b in vivo in the cotton rat model 
(Zhu et al, 2017) . Nirsevimab is current ly under development by [CONTACT_38227] (hereafter, the 
Sponsor) for the passive immunizat ion of all infants entering their first RSV season and
children with CLD or CHD entering their first and second RSV season for the prevent ion of 
LRTI caused by [CONTACT_4510]. Nirsevimab may  provide a cost -effect ive opportunit y to protect all 
infants fro m RSV di sease based on an improvement in potency  and the extended t 1/2that is 
expected to support once -per-RSV- season dosing.

Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 16of 74 Template 18.0nirsevimab, was evaluated in cotton rats following a single IM dose of 0.25 to 3.0 mg/kg. 
Serum  concentrati ons increased dose proportionally  across the enti re dose range wi th a 
terminal -phase eliminat ion t1/2of approximately  1 day . In cotto n rats, a serum concentration o f 
6.8 μg/m L resulted in a 3- log reduction in lung RSV titers and for Phase 2b was ident ified as 
the target serum concentration to maintain in children to provide ant iviral activity against RSV 
over the RSV season.
The YTE ami no acid subst itutions introduced into nirsevimab do not impact RSV neutralizing 
activit y when com pared to the parental  mAb, 1G7. Nirsevimab/1G7 showed potent antiviral 
activit y in vitro against RSV A and B laboratory  strains, clinical isolates, as well as 
palivizumab -resistant viruses. Nirsevimab/1G7 was > 150-fold more poten t than 
palivizumab in 
vitro against the laboratory  strains and > 50-fold more potent than 
palivizumab against clinical iso lates based on the median half -maximal inhibitory  
concentration (Zhu et al , 2017 ).
Toxicit y, toxicokinet ics, and immunogenicit y of nirsevimab were evaluated in a Good 
Laboratory  Practi ce-compliant repeat -dose intravenous (IV) and IM toxico logy study  
conducted in cyno molgus monk eys. Cyno molgus mo nkeys represent a pharmaco logically 
relevant m odel for nonclinical  safety  assessment based on similar binding of nirsevimab to 
cyno molgus monkey neonatal  Fc receptor (FcRn) compared to human FcRn. Toxico logy 
studi es in cyno molgus mo nkeys indicate that there is no evidence of nirsevimab toxicit y in 
these animal models. Once weekly IV or IM administration (5 doses total) of nirsevimab to 
monkeys, up to and including 300 mg/kg IV or [ADDRESS_1000969] -level was considered to be 300 mg/kg IV and 300 mg IM. No antidrug ant ibody  (ADA) 
was detected in any  of the m onkeys during the treatment phase. During the recovery  phase,

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 17of 74 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1a Study D5290C00001
Study  D5290C00001 was a first- time- in-human Phase 1a, randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -
controlled, dose -escalat ion study  conducted to evaluate the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and ADA 
of nirsevimab co mpared to placebo in healt hy adult v olunteers (Griffin et al, 2017) . This study  
was completed in June 2015. A total of 136 subjects were randomized and received a single 
fixed dose of nirsevimab (6 subjects eac h at doses of 300 mg IV, 1,000 mg IV, 3,000 mg IV, 
100 m g IM, and 78 subjects at 300 mg IM) or placebo (34 subjects). All subjects were 
followed for approximately  360 days after dosing.
Safety
The safet y profile of nirsevimab was favorable, with similar pr oporti ons of 
treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the placebo (61.8%) group and the 
nirsevimab (62.7%) total group. Two treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs; 
gunshot wound and appendicit is) were reported in [ADDRESS_1000972] were reported in 29.4% of subjects in the placebo group, and 
17.6% of subjects in the nirsevimab total group. The most frequent TEAEs in the nirsevimab 
total group incl uded upper respi [INVESTIGATOR_53121] i nfection (URTI; 18.6%); headache (8.8%); 
urinary  tract infect ion (5.9%); and dermat itis contact, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and 
vomiting (4.9% each). The most frequent ly occurring TEAEs in the placebo group were 
headache (17.6%); URTI (8.8%); and nausea , increased bl ood creatine phosphokinase level, 
and paresthesia (5.9% each). There were no adverse events of special interest (AESIs) or new 
onset chronic diseases (NOCDs). There were no deaths. No safet y signals in this healt hy adult 
popul ation were obser ved. These results demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile for 
nirsevimab, including no observed hypersensit ivity reacti ons, and supported further clinical 
studi es of  IM administrati on of  1 dose of nirsevimab in the target populat ion of infants to 
provi de protecti on for the durati on of  the RSV season.
Pharmacokinetics
A 2-compartm ent PK m odel adequately  described the PK profile following both IV and IM 
administrations. Body  weight was determined to be a significant covariate on sy stemic 
clearance and vol ume of distribut ion with allometric exponents. The mean populat ion 
clearance and vol ume of distribut ion were 42.3 mL/day  and 2.8 L, respectively . The m ean t 1/2
of nirsevimab ranged from 85 to 117 day s across dose groups, and bioavailabilit y after IM 
adminis tration was 77%. The predicted 3
-to 4-fold increase in the t 1/2of nirsevimab com pared 
to a standard IgG antibody  was confi rmed.
Antidrug Antibody
Post-baseline ADA was detected in 13.7% of subjects in the nirsevimab total group and 
15.2% of subjects in the placebo group, wi th a maximum  titer of  1:800 and 1:400, 
respectively . On Day  361, ADA was detected in 5.3% of nirsevimab subjects and 10.7% of

1.4.2 Phase 1b/2a Study D5290C00002
Study  D5290C00002 was a Phase 1b/2a, rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, single 
ascending -dose study  to eval uate the safet y, PK, and ADA of nirsevimab in healthy preterm  
infants (Domachowske et al , 2018 ). The populat ion enrolled was healt hy preterm infants born 
between 32 weeks 0 day s and 34 weeks 6 day s gestation who woul d not receive RSV 
prophylaxis based on the American Academy of Pediatrics or other national or local 
guidelines. These subjec ts woul d not be receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo 
comparator group. A total of 89 infants from  sites in the Uni ted States (US), Chile, and South 
Africa were randomized and received a single IM dose of nirsevimab (10, 25, or 50 mg; 8, 31, 
and 32 subjects, respectively ) or pl acebo (18 subjects) and were followed for approximately  
360days after dosing. 
Safety
A total o f 66 subjects (93.0%) in the nirsevimab group and 17 subjects (94.4%) in the placebo 
group reported at least 1 TEAE. No safet y signals were observed with ascending dose levels. 
The m ajority of the events were mild or moderate in severity; only 2 TEAEs were assessed as 
≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1000975] igator. There we re no deaths, AESIs, or NOCDs in any  dose group. 
Three nirsevimab subjects (4.2%) had a total o f [ADDRESS_1000976] igator; no subjects in the placebo group had a 
TESAE. One infant who r eceived [ADDRESS_1000977] ion (RT -PCR) testing fro m the central  laboratory  
was negative for RSV (but posit ive for hum an metapneumo virus [hMPV]); the illness 
resolved. The sa me infant was again hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468964], and subsequent RT- PCR testing 
was posi tive for RSV B; the event resolved. One infant who received 50 mg of nirsevimab 
was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732594] n; the infant recovered. A second infant who received 
50mg o f nirsevimab was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732594] n and a concurrent LRTI. Testing 
for RSV was not performed, and the infant recovered from both events.
The m ost frequently reported TEAEs for the nirsevimab group were URTI (69.0%), 
gastroenterit is (29 .6%), cough (25.4%), py rexia (22.5%), and otit is media (21.1%). There 
were no trends by  [CONTACT_732668]. The most frequent ly reported TEAEs 
in the placebo group were URTI (66.7%), anemia (33.3%), and gastroenteritis, cough, and 
otitis media (22.2% each). Skin rashes (defined as adverse events [AEs] that coded to the

subjects in the nirsevimab group. No skin events were consistent with hypersensit ivity. 
Pharmacokinetics
Nirsevimab exhibited a less -than-dose-proporti onal exposure increase between the 10 -and 
25-mg doses; however, exposure increase was dose proportional between 25 -and 50 -mg 
doses. Following a single IM dose of 10, 25, or 50 mg, the estimated t 1/2of nirsevimab ranged 
from 62.5 to 72.9 days. On Day  151, 87% of the nirsevimab serum concentrations fo llowing 
the 50-mg IM dose were above the 90% effect
ive concentration threshold o f 6.8 μg/m L.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20of 74 Template 18.0Efficacy
Based on the analysis in the Intent -to-treat Populatio n,a single dose of 50 mg IM nirsevimab 
resul ted in a 70.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.3%, 81.2%; p < 0.0001) relat ive risk 
reducti on (RRR) in the incidence of medically attended RSV- confirmed LRTI through 
Day [ADDRESS_1000980] acebo. Addi tionall y, a 78.4% (95% CI: 51.9%, 90.3%; 
p = 0.0002) RRR in the incidence of RSV LRTI hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270522] 151 was seen in 
the nirsevimab recipi[INVESTIGATOR_732595]. 
Safety
The safet y profile of nirsevimab was similar to that of placebo, with no new identified risks. 
Overall, 86.2% of subjects in the nirsevimab group and 86.8% of subjects in the placebo 
group had at least 1 TEAE. TEAEs ≤[ADDRESS_1000981] dose occurred in 2.5% of subjects in both 
groups. In comparison to the placebo group, the nirsevimab group had a numerically  lower 
incidence of TEAEs occurring ≤ [ADDRESS_1000982] dose (nirsevimab 12.5%, placebo 15.2%), 
TEAEs ≥Grade 3 in severit y (nirsevimab 8.0%, placebo 12.5%), or TESAEs (nirsevimab 
11.2%, placebo 16.9%). The majorit y of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit y. The 
most comm on TESAEs, based on the nirsevimab group, were bronchio litis (2.1% nirsevimab, 
4.4% pl acebo), LRTI (1.4% nirsevimab, 2.7% placebo), bronchit is (1.4% nirsevimab, 
2.3% placebo), and pneumonia (1.3% nirsevimab, 2.1% placebo). None of the TESAEs were 
considered related to invest igational product by  [CONTACT_24342]. Five deaths were reported 
during the study  through Day  361, including 2 subjects (0.2%) in the nirsevimab group and 
3subjects (0.6%) in the placebo group. Non e of the deaths were considered to be related to 
investigat ional product according to the Invest igator.
Overall, the incidence of treatment -related TEAEs (nirsevimab 2.3%, placebo 2.1%); AESIs, 
including hypersensit ivity, immune com plex disease, and thromb ocytopeni a (nirsevimab 
0.5%, pl acebo 0.6%); and NOCDs (nirsevimab 0.4%, placebo 0.8%) was low and generally 
comparable between the placebo and nirsevimab groups. AESIs were reported in 5 subjects 
(4subjects with rash or rash macular and [ADDRESS_1000983] with petechiae) in the nirsevimab group 
and 3 subjects (rash or rash papular) in the placebo group. All events were Grade 1 in severit y. 
The TEAE of petechiae that was reported as an AESI was 1 day  in duration and was reported 
by [CONTACT_732669]. There were no laboratory 
assessments for the petechiae.
TEAEs that invo lved the skin and subcutaneous tissues (including diaper rash) were collected 
as skin react ions, with a few except ions for skin reactions that could be definit ively diagnosed 
such as impet igo, varicella, and scabies. Skin reactio ns were reported in a similar percentage 
of subjects in both treatment groups (nirsevimab 32.9%, placebo 30.9%).

Antidrug Antibody
Overall, the rate and titers of ADA were low, and in post- baseline ADA -positive subjects 
there was no apparent effect on PK or safety . Of the subjects who had serum samples 
available for testing, ADA was detected post baseline in 5.6% (52/929) of subjects in the 
nirsevimab group and 3.8% (18/469) of subjects in the placebo group. ADA titers ranged fro m 
1:50 to 1:6,400 in the nirsevimab group and from 1:50 to 1:[ADDRESS_1000984]- baseline ADA posit ive, ADA targeting the YTE domain 
was observed in 4/17 subjects (23.5%) on Day  151 and 23/30 subjects (76.7%) on Day  361. 
Three nirsevimab subjects had NAb on Day  361.
1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
Prevent ion of RSV illnesses in all infants is a majo r public healt h priority; however, despi[INVESTIGATOR_732596] 50 y ears of attem pted vaccine development, there are no licensed vaccines. While 
RSV prevent ion exists in the form of a speci fic RSV IgG (palivizumab) requiring [ADDRESS_1000985] morbidit y and 
mortalit y from RSV: preterm  infants born ≤ 35 weeks GA, children wit h CLD of prematurit y, 
children with hemodynamically significant CHD and ,in Japan, children ≤ [ADDRESS_1000986] all infants from RSV disease based on improved 
potency  and an extended t1/2, whi ch is expected to support once -per-RSV- season dosing.
The nirsevimab clinical development program includes [ADDRESS_1000987] RSV season: the completed Phase 2b study  (D5290C00003) and an ongoing Phase 3 
study  (D52 90C00004) in healt hy late term and term infants. Because of the significant 
advantage of one dose per RSV- season that nirsevimab would provide, the Sponsor recognizes 
the potenti ally important benefits for the pediatric populat ion receiving palivizumab who must 
receive mo nthly inject ions during the RSV -season for protection. A Phase 2/3 study  
(D5290C0005) is currently being conducted in the high -risk palivizumab -eligible popul ation 
entering their first and second RSV seasons. In addit ion, this Phase 2 study is planned to 
support an indicat ion for a single dose of nirsevimab at the start of the RSV season in 
immunocom promised children who are ≤ 24 months o f age. 
Primarily , the PK data in this study  will be used to assess whether nirsevimab systemic 
exposure is altered in this populat ion as co mpared to healt hy infants. The effects of immune

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22of [ADDRESS_1000988] their origin in the 
Declara tion of  Helsinki and are consistent with Internat ional Council for Harmonisat ion 
(ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
To evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for nirsevimab, nonclinical and clinical data have 
been taken into consideration. Based on the risk of serious RSV disease in infants and 
high-risk children, there is an established unmet medical need for the use of nirsevimab for 
prophylaxis in all infants entering their first RSV season and in high -risk pr eterm  infants and 
children ≤ 24 m onths of age with CLD or CHD. Addit ionally , in Japan, palivizumab is 
approved for use in immunoco mpromised children ≤ 24 months of age. Children in this study  
(ie, ≤ 24 months o f age wi th an immunocom promised m edical condit ion) who receive 
nirsevimab may  potenti ally benefit by  [CONTACT_732670]. 
Nirsevimab is expected to provide similar efficacy  benefi ts as palivizumab wi th the advantage 
of requi ring a single IM dose instead of the 5 IM doses requir ed for palivizumab.
Nirsevimab has no endogenous targets, and no safety  concerns were ident ified in nonclinical 
studi es. The potenti al risks are based primarily on safet y risks that m ay be observed with any 
immunogl obulin, including mAbs such as palivizuma b. These potential risks include, but are 
not limited to, hy persensi tivity (including anaphylaxis), immune complex disease, 
thrombocy topenia, and injection site react ions. To date, there have been no observed events of 
anaphylaxis, significant hy persensi tivity react ions, immune co mplex disease, or 
thrombocy topenia attributable to nirsevimab in the clinical studies. Nonetheless, subjects in 
nirsevimab clinical studies will cont inue to be monitored for important potential risks, and 
routi ne pharmacovigilance and risk minimizat ion activit ies will be performed accordingly.
The benefit -risk assessment for nirsevimab in prevent ion of RSV disease based on the 
development through Phase 2b is favorable.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27of 74 Template 18.03.2 Rationale for Dose, Population, and Endpoints
3.2.1 Dose Rationale
A single fixed 50- mg IM dose was shown to be efficacious in the Phase 2b Study  
D5290C00003 in preterm infants (29 to < 35 weeks GA) in their first RSV season. 
Model -based analyses of the Phase 2b clinical PK and efficacy  data i dentified a projected 
serum  AUC 0-∞of 13.4 day⋅mg/mL as the protecti ve exposure thresho ld. The risk of medically 
attended RSV- confirmed LRTI over the course of the RSV season was significantly lower in 
infants wi th higher proj ected AUC 0-∞. Infants wi th AUC 0-∞above 13.4 day⋅mg/mL had a 
statist ically significant higher prob abilit y of protecti on based on exposure -response analysis 
using Cox proporti onal hazard regressi on. Al though, the fixed 50- mg dose resulted in 
clinically efficacious exposures for 97% of infants weighing < 5 kg in the Phase 2b study, this 
dose was suboptim al for infants wei ghing ≥ 5 kg in this study . Overall, 3% and 59% of the 
infants in groups weighing < 5 kg and ≥ [ADDRESS_1000993] AUC 0-∞quartile 
(4.5 to 13.4 day ⋅mg/mL) that was determined to be suboptimal. Addit ionally, a cut point 
analysis of the weight -norm alized doses of all treated infants revealed that a 10 mg/kg dose 
was the corresponding clinically efficacious and protective thresho ld dose. Henceforth, based 
on these analyses, a stratified fixed dosing strategy by [CONTACT_732672] -time curve throughout the RSV season. Based on dose optimizat ion analysis 
designed to m aximize the proportion of infants with clinically  efficaci ous ni rsevimab serum  
exposure, for infants entering their first RSV season a single fixed 50 -mg IM dose is proposed 
for infants with body  weight < 5 kg, while a single fixed 100- mg dose is proposed for infants 
weighing ≥ [ADDRESS_1000994] been no reports that IgG1 kappa mAb compounds 
show obvious ethnic differences. 
3.2.2 Rationale for Study Population
Children with immunodeficiencie s are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, leading to 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509], admissio n to the ICU, and mechanical vent ilation (Manzoni et al, 
2017; Welliver, 2003 ). Currently , there i s no specific treatment for RSV infect ion. In Japan, 
palivizumab is approved for the prevent ion of RSV infection in children with 
immunocom promised condit ions. Palivizumab has been found t o be generally  safe and 
effect ive in this populat ion (Kashiwagi et al, 2018; Mori  et al , 2014 ), but because of its t 1/2of 
approximately  1 month, infants and y oung children need to receive monthly IM doses of 
palivizumab throughout the RSV- season to maintain protection.

its dem onstrated i ncreased potency  and extended t 1/2. Bec ause of the significant advantage of 
one dose per RSV season that nirsevimab would provide, the Sponsor recognizes the 
potenti ally important benefits for the current pediatric populat ion receiving palivizumab. This 
Phase 2 study  is planned to evaluate the safety  and tol erabili ty, PK, ADA, and efficacy  of 
nirsevimab in immunocompromised children ≤ 24 mo nths of age.
3.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
Nirsevimab is being developed to provide RSV immunoprophylaxis for all infants and y oung 
children, including immunocompromised children ≤ [ADDRESS_1000995] measures of TEAEs/TESAE s, AESIs, 
and NOCDs will be used for this assessment. All subjects will be fo llowed for approximately

The term  AE is used to include both serious and nonserious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including

5.3.1 Serious Hypersensitivity (Including Anaphylaxis and Immune Complex 
Disease)
[IP_ADDRESS] Immediate Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Administrati on of  polyclo nal immunoglobulin preparations and mAbs has been associated 
with immediate (ty pe I) hy persensi tivity (including anaphylaxis) th at occurs during or after 
dosing. An immediate hy persensi tivity react ion is defined as an acute onset of an illness with 
involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both that occurs during or after administration of 
investigat ional product (but does not me et the definit ion of anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is a rare 
event, usually  occurring after subsequent exposure to antigen, and it is most commonly 
accompanied by [CONTACT_589512]/or mucosal react ions. It i s potenti ally a fatal , 
systemic allergic react ion that i s dist inct from simple allergic react ions (eg, rash, pruritus) 
because of the simultaneous invo lvement of several organ systems (Sampson et al , 2006 ). A 
full defi nition of  anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix B. See Secti on5.5for recording AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Complex Disease
Immune com plex disease can manifest in the form of a number of condit ions such as 
vasculit is, endocardit is, neurit is, gl omerulonephri tis, serum  sickness, and arthralgias. 
Drug -induced immune co mplex (ty pe II I) hy persensi tivity reacti ons can occur when the host 
immune system generates ant ibodies to drug resulting in so luble circulating ant igen-antibody  
complexes formati on and thei r deposi tion in bl ood vessels. Subsequent ly this init iates ti ssue 
damaging inflammatory  reacti ons m ediated by  [CONTACT_316779]/or l eukocy tes and mast cells. 
The pathology  and clinical  manifestati ons are dependent on the tissues/organs invo lved, wi th 
vascular, skin, and renal t issues being commo n sites of injury . Comm on examples of immune
complex hypersensit ivity reacti ons are serum  sickness (systemic) and Arthus react ions (local). 
The clinical manifestations o f serum  sickness include skin rash, fever, malaise, and 
polyarthralgias or polyarthrit is. Symptoms ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_616565] [ADDRESS_1001042] exposure 
to antigen and usually reso lve in several weeks after withdrawal of the causat ive agent. Serum 
sickness needs to be differentiated from other ‘serum -sickness -like’ react ions that have a 
similar clinical presentation (eg, viral infection s, ant i-seizure drugs), but are believed to have 
different pathogenic mechanisms. Both serum sickness and serum sickness -like react ions have

shoul d be considered f or the di agnosis and differentiat ion of these react ions. Diagnosis of 
these suspected reactions is best confirmed via bio psy of the affected tissues. See Section 5.5
for recording AEs. 
5.3.2 Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocy topeni a is a disorder in which there is an abnormally low platelet count; a normal 
platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per μL. The 3 major causes of low 
platelet counts in clude: 1) insufficient platelet synthesis in the bone marrow; 2) increased 
breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream; and 3) increased breakdown o f platelets in the 
spleen or liver. General symptoms of thrombocy topenia include bleeding in the mouth and 
gums, bruising, nosebleeds, and petechiae (pi[INVESTIGATOR_732643]/rash). Severe bleeding is the 
major complicat ion, which may  occur in the brain or gastrointest inal tract. Drug- induced 
thrombocy topenia is a reversible form of thrombocy topenia that shoul d be suspe cted in a 
subject who presents with new onset thrombocy topenia or recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_732644], wi thout an obvious alternat ive etiology. It is commo nly induced by  
[CONTACT_9934]-dependent antibodies that cause platelet destruction or clearance by [CONTACT_732683]  (drug -induced immune thrombocy topenia), and l ess comm only by  
[CONTACT_9934]-induced bone marrow suppression or autoimmune thrombocytopenia that is init iated by  
[CONTACT_316781]. The init ial approa ch to the subject 
with suspected drug -induced thrombocytopenia invo lves confirming thrombocytopenia, 
establishing a temporal relat ionship to a drug, and eliminat ing other causes of 
thrombocy topenia. The di agnosis is m ade clinically  by [CONTACT_732684] (ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_84717] 1 week). Most 
subjects wi th drug -induced thrombocytopenia require no specific treatment, as their platelet 
counts will recover prompt ly following withdrawal of the c ausat ive agent. See Section 5.5for 
recording AEs.

medically significant. Examples of NOCDs include, but are not limited ,to diabetes, 
autoimmune disease (eg, lupus, rheumatoid art hritis), and neurological disease (eg, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]). 
Events that would not be considered as NOCDs are mild eczema, diagnosis of a congenital 
anomaly present at study  entry , or acute illness (eg, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_103415], oti tis media, 
bronchit is). See Sect ion5.5for recording AEs.
5.5 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs, including SAEs, AESIs, and NOCDs, will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized 
medical term  or di agnosis that accurately reflects the event. These events will be assessed by

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66of 74 Template 18.0Appendix AAdditional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from an adverse event 
(AE) as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or cont inued use of the product would result in 
the subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does no t mean that had an AE occurred in a more 
severe form ,it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96698] a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it maybe (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deterio rate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], disabilit y, or incapacit y but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These 
shoul d usually be considered as serious .
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
Hepato toxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n) or conv ulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Assessment of Severity
Assessment of severit y is one of the responsibilit ies of the Invest igator in the evaluat ion of 
AEs and SAEs. The determinat ion of severit y should be m ade by  [CONTACT_732688] y categori es of  Grade 1 to 5 ,as defined below.

Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an 
imminent ri sk of death.
Grade [ADDRESS_1001082]. The fo llowing factors shoul d be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibilit y” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].
Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigat ional product. Has the subject actually  
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
Consistency wit h known invest igational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect invest igational product (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) 
or products of the sam e pharmacol ogical class? OR could the AE be ant icipated fro m its 
pharmaco logical properti es? 
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732663]?
No al ternative cause. The AE canno t be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_33154], other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.

Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 68of 74 Template 18.0Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected invest igational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopp ed? The Sponsor would not normally reco mmend or 
support a re -challenge.
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered ,such as:
Is this a recogni zed feature of overdose of the investigat ional product?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individ ual case. The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data incl uding enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relat ionship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreat ment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration o f investigational product) as well as treatment -emergent 
SAEs. A protocol -related SAE m ay occur as a result of a procedure or intervent ion required 
during the study  (eg, bl ood collect ion,washout of an exist ing medicat ion). The fo llowing 
guidelines shoul d be used by  [CONTACT_732689]:
Protocol  related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for wh ich there i s no al ternat ive et iology  present in the 
subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etio logy other than the procedure/ 
intervent ion that was described in the protocol (the alternative et iology 
must be documented i n the study  subject’s m edical record).

and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
C 1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report potential Hy’s Law cases and Hy’s Law cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. 
During the course of the study , the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets 
potenti al Hy’s Law cri teria at any  point during the s tudy.
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of potenti al Hy’s Law and 
Hy’s Law events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other visi ts 
including all local laboratory  evaluat ions even if collected outsid e of the study  visit s. For 
example, potenti al Hy’s Law criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_96724]  a central  
laboratory  and/or elevated TBL from  a local laboratory .
The Investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevat ions 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible potenti al Hy’s Law events.
The Investigator participates, together with Sponsor clinical project representatives, in review 
and assessment of cases meeting potential Hy’s Law criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law 
criteria are met. Hy ’s Law cri teria are m et if there is no al ternative explanat ion for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry  other than drug- induced liver injury caused by [CONTACT_33155].
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to potenti al Hy’s Law/Hy’s Law 
cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment 
in line wit h standard safety  reporting processes.

C2.2 Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the invest igational product, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases; eg, elevated 
alkaline phosphatase indicating cho lestasis, viral hepatitis, or another drug.

In order to i dentify  cases of potential  Hy’s Law, i t is important to perform a com prehensive 
review of laboratory  data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria 
in isolation or in co mbinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
AST ≥ 3 × ULN
TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
The Investigator will ,without del ay,review each new laboratory  report and,if the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met ,will:
Notify  the Sponsor study representative
Repeat the test (new blood draw) without delay
Determine whether the participant meets potenti al Hy’s Law criteria (see Section C 2for 
definit ion) by  [CONTACT_732690]
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  case report form (CRF) module(s) with 
the original l ocal laboratory  test result .
C 4 Follow -up
C4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the subject does not meet potential Hy’s Law criteria the Invest igator will:
Inform  the Sponsor study  representative that the participant has not met potential Hy’s 
Law criteria.
Perform  follow-
up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts, as applicable.
C4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the subject does meet potential Hy’s Law criteria the Investigator will:
Notify  the Sponsor study representative who will then inform the study team
Within 1 day of potential Hy’s Law criteria being met, the I nvest igator will report the 
case as an SAE of Potential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and 
causalit y assessment ‘yes/related’ according to clinical study  protocol  process for SAE 
reporting .

approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the 
continuous review of data. 
Subsequent to this contac t the Invest igator will:
Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Complete fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the et iology of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the m edical m onitor.

C 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul dbe followed for all  cases where potenti al Hy’s Law 
criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the m edical 
monitor will  contact [CONTACT_732691]’s Law cri teria other than 
drug-induced liver injury caused by [CONTACT_33159], to ensure timely analysis and 
reporting to health authorit ies per l ocal requi rements from  the date potenti al Hy’s Law cri teria 
were m et. The m edical m onitor and Gl obal Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this 
review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new information (reas sessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the Sponsor’s standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the invest igational product:

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73of 74 Template 18.0Send the updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to the Sponsor’s standard 
processes.
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the Hy’s Law case, a causalit y assessment 
of ‘related’ should be assigned .
If, there i s an unavo idable delay of over 15 calendar day s in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for Hy ’s Law, then it is assumed 
that there is no alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi de any further update to the previously  submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law (report 
term now ‘Hy’s Law case’), ensuring causalit y assessment are related to the 
investigat ional product and seriousn ess criteria is medically important, according to the 
clinical study  protocol  process for SAE reporting
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to de termine 
whether Hy’s Law criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted potential Hy’s 
Law SAE report fo llowing clinical study  protocol  process for SAE reporti ng, according to 
the outcom e of the review and am end the reported term if an alternat iveexplanat ion for 
the liver biochemistry  elevati ons is determined .
C 6 Actions Required for Repeat Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33099]’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a subject meets potent ial Hy’s Law criteria on study  treatm ent 
and has already met potential Hy’s Law cri teria at a previous on study  treatment vi sit.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
potenti al Hy’s Law is based on the nature of the alternat ive cause ident ified for the previous 
occurrence.
The i Ivestigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of potential Hy’s Law 
criteria being met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the alternat ive cause for the previous occurrence o f potenti al Hy’s Law cri teria being 
met found to be the dis ease under study  eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, 
severe infect ion, or liver disease? 
If No: follow the process described in Sect ion C4.2, for reporting potential Hy’s Law as an 
SAE .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74of 74 Template 18.0If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condit ion compared 
with when potenti al Hy’s Law criteria were previo usly met:
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change fo llow the process described in Section C4.2, for reporting 
potenti al Hy’s Law as an SAE .
A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolat ion or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  releva nt change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator; this 
may be in consultat ion with the medical  monitor if there i s any  uncertaint y.
C 7 Laboratory Tests
To evaluate the underlying et io
logy of potenti al Hy’s Law cases, relevant laboratory  tests m ay 
be perform ed as clinically  indicated.

Section  4.6 Rationale included in this section for the use of  
the weight -based dose regimen in pediatric 
subjects from Study 160325 who roll over into 
the current Study 42-1703.  Population pharmacokinetic  
modeling has demonstrated that  
diazepam exposure following 
DBF (like Diastat rectal gel) is  
dependent on body size. For this  
reason, the DBF dose for  
subjects entering Study 42- 1703 
from the Study 160325 performed in pediatric subjects  
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] < [ADDRESS_706952]  received  DBF  as part of 
the Study  160325 will be  
determined using the weight - 
based dosing regimen employed in Study 160325.  
Subjects enrolled directly into  
Study 42- 1703 and who are  
naive to DBF will be dosed according to the 42- 1703 
protocol dose regimen ( Table 4 ). 
After  receiving  their first dose 
of DBF,  these  subjects  will be 
re-evaluated by [CONTACT_541951], according to Investigator's  
judgment, may be moved to Table 5 for dose determination.  
Subjects already enrolled and  
dosed in Study 42 -1703  
according to the 42- 1703 
protocol dose regimen ( Table 4 ) 
may be moved to Table 5 for 
dose determination after re- evaluation by [CONTACT_541951], according to Investigator's  
judgment.  
Subjects who enter Study  
42-1703 from the pediatric  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_541854] 
160325  will be dosed  according  Section  6.1 Sentence add to the description of overall study design: Study drug dosing is determined first  
according to age group and then by [CONTACT_541952] ( Table 4 ) for subjects who  
entered into the present study 42- 1703 never  
having received DBF as study drug before and 
Table 5 for rollover subjects from the pediatric  
EMU  study  160325).

 For subjects who continue beyond Month 6

 If a subject has not had 3 uses of DBF at the 6- month visit (Visit 5), or any visit after that, the  
Investigator should strongly consider the  
likelihood of the subject using DBF and whether  
the subject should continue in the study. The  
Investigator may consult  with the Medical  
Monitor, if needed, to assess on a case -by-case 
basis the likelihood of achieving [ADDRESS_706956]’s participation  
can be extended with a similar schedule of

1. SYNOPSIS  
 
Title  of Study  An Open -Label, Safety and Tolerability Study of Chronic Intermittent  
Use of Diazepam  Buccal  Soluble  Film  (DBSF)  in Pediatric,  Adolescent, 
and Adult Subjects  with Epi[INVESTIGATOR_541859]  42-1703  
Investigator/Study  
Sites  Approximately  20 United  States  (US)  study sites are projected  
Phase of  
Development  3 
Objectives:  Primary  objective  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of DBF (study drug)  
administered  a minimum  of 3 times  to subjects  with epi[INVESTIGATOR_541860] a minimum  6-month  period.  
Secondary  objectives  
• To evaluate the usability  of study drug as assessed  by [CONTACT_541958]/subjects to administer study drug based on the  
Instructions  for Use  (IFU) 
• To evaluate the Quality of Life (QoL) of the subjects during the  
study drug treatment  period as assessed  by [CONTACT_541959]-appropriate  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_541861] a minimum  6-month  period.  
Study  Design  This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open -label, long -term safety and  
tolerability  study conducted  in male  and female pediatric  (2 to 12 years  
old), adolescent (13 to 16 years old), and adult subjects (17 to 65 years  
old) with a clinical diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541862] (e.g., Acute Repetitive Seizures [ARS], frequent  
breakthrough seizures, seizure clusters,  or cluster  seizures)  and who are 
on chronic intermittent use of a rescue medication (e.g.,  Diastat® 
AcuDial™ or other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  
Subjects  who have  completed  the Phase  2 studies  160325  (Pediatric)  or 
160326 (Adult) which enrolled subjects with a similar diagnosis may screen  for enrollment  into this Phase  [ADDRESS_706968] treatment period in the Phase 2 study  
(rollover subjects). These rollover subjects will be screened for  
enrollment  using inclusion/exclusion criteria  of this protocol  (42-1703).  
The Screening visit for the Phase 3 study c an be conducted on the day 
of the follow -up visit for the Phase 2 study.  
Subjects  who initially  consented  and enrolled  in the study under  version 
1 of the protocol dated 31 July 2017 may come in at their next  
scheduled site visit, reconsent under the amended protocol and be  
dispensed a new container of DBF based upon the revised mg/kg dosing.  The subjects  do not need  to come in for unscheduled  visit.

 Screening:  Screening  for enrollment eligibility  can occur  within  [ADDRESS_706969]’s  legally  authorized  representative  and oral and/or  written  assent  
will be obtained from  the subject  as required  by [CONTACT_541960]  (IRB). 
As a part of screening,  potential subjects  and caregivers  will be advised  
that electronic diaries will be used by [CONTACT_267300]/or caregivers to  
document seizures, use of study drug, adverse events (AEs), and 
changes in concomitant medication to determine their  
ability/willingness  to comply with this procedure.  
Subjects  may be re-screened  during the study per Investigator  judgment  
after consultation  with and approval  by [CONTACT_46449].  
The last Screening  Visit is [ADDRESS_706970]  will be a minimum  of 6 months:

# Planned  date  for last Telephone  Contact  [CONTACT_832] 09 October  2020.  
 
Subjects  who  are ongoing  on 28 February  2020,  who  are benefitting  from  the use of DBSF,  and who  would  like to stay on 
study,  will be allowed  to continue  until  study  end.  
 Baseline Visit (Study Day 1) -Conducted after completion of  
screening  and confirmation  of eligibility  for study  enrollment -based  
compliance with protocol Inclusion and Exclusion criteria: The last  
Baseline  Visit/Study  Day 1 will occur  no later than 06 March  2020.  
Training will be performed by [CONTACT_541961].  The training  
will be reinforced  at all subsequent  study visits/contacts.  
Study drug dosing will be administered  away  from  the study  site by [CONTACT_1560],  with the assistance  of a caregiver  as appropriate.  
Administration  and usability  of study drug will be recorded  at home  in 
the electronic  diary  after each use of study  drug.  The electronic  diary  
will also be used at home  to capture  seizure  history  and changes  in 
health  and medications.  
Subjects/caregivers will be instructed to call the site when the first seizure prompts  study drug administration.  A study site visit will occur  
within  [ADDRESS_706973]  Seizure Prompting  Study  Drug  
Administration:  
A study site visit will be conducted  within  [ADDRESS_706974]  or caregiver  (if needed)  will document  the seizure and study 
drug administration  in the electronic  study  diary  AND call the study site 
after the first use of study drug.  
Based on subject diagnosis and history (Inclusion Criteria), it is  
expected  that subjects  will have  a minimum  of [ADDRESS_706975] at 1 Month and 2 Months After Study Day 1:  
The study site staff will telephone  the subjects  at approximately 1 and 2 
months  ± [ADDRESS_706976]’s  health  
and seizure status, reinforce training on study drug administration and  
diary documentation, determine if study drug was used, and to address  
concerns.  
Site Visit  at 3 Months  and 6 Months  After  Study  Day 1: A study site 
visit will be conducted every 3 months ± 14 days over the minimum 6 - 
month course of  treatment.  
At the Month 3 visit, the subjects (and their caregivers as appropriate)  
will have a review of the number of study drug uses, study drug 
usability  assessment,  seizure- control  status,  use of the study  diary,  AEs,  
concomitant medications, and subject/caregiver training. Subjects will 
undergo assessment of oral mucosal health, gustatory assessment, vital  
signs, physical and neurological examination, collection of blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory testing, 12 -lead E CG, age - 
appropriate Quality of Life (QoL) and Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating  Scale (C-SSRS) assessments.  
The QoL and C -SSRS should be completed in appropriately aged 
subjects. These assessments may be omitted as applicable if a subject's  
cognitive statu s does not allow the subject to personally complete the  
assessment.  The site must  document  in the source  documents  the reason  
that these  assessments  cannot  be completed  (e.g., unable  to perform  test 
due to incapacity, etc.).  
For all age groups,  height  and weight  will be measured  and body mass 
index (BMI; kg/m2) recorded.  
Urine and serum pregnancy testing will be performed at for female  
subjects of childbearing potential. If the subject is unable to provide a  
urine  sample, the option  to use only the serum  pregnancy test will be at 
the Investigator's discretion. The reason that urine pregnancy screen could not be completed  should  be documented in the source  documents  
and the Case  Report Form.

 • C-SSRS:  if a subject  cannot  complete  the questionnaire,  the site must  
document  this. 
 • Clinical  laboratory  tests (hematology,  serum  chemistry,  urinalysis,  
and urine and serum pregnancy tests for female subjects of  
childbearing potential)  
If the subject is unable to provide a urine sample, the opt ion to use  
only the serum  pregnancy  test will be at the Investigator's  discretion.  
If a protocol -required urine sample cannot be obtained from the subject  
(at any study visit), the site must document the reason why the urine  
sample could not be obtained from the subject (e.g., subject is  
incontinent,  subject  is incapable of supplying a urine  sample  on request,  
etc.) in the source documents and via the eCRF.  Urine samples  
obtained using a urine collection bag are acceptable. Urine- soaked  
diapers,  urine  pads,  etc. are not acceptable methods  of obtaining a urine  
sample for this study. The Sponsor does not advocate use of a urinary 
catheter  
• Review of electronic diary which will capture the occurrence of 
seizures, use of study drug, usability assessment, study drug 
placement (left or right) for each seizure cluster treated, AE  
information,  and any changes  in medication.  This information  can be 
review directly in the subject’s electronic diary or via the Engage  
Portal  database.  
 Tolerability  Assessments: 
At each study site visit:  
• Oral examination  for assessment  of oral mucosa  
• Gustatory sense assessment in subjects 12 years of age and older by

4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background on Treatment  and Management  of Individuals  
with Refractory  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_80296] (ARS)  comprising breakthrough seizures,  repetitive seizures,  
and seizure clusters occur in a significant number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541883]. These types of seizures have distinguishable  
characteristics that are usually  recognized  by [CONTACT_1962],  caregivers,  and physicians.  
Although patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_80298], these seizures can last anywhere  
from minutes to hours.[ 1] When these seizures occur outside a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the patient is  
often transported to an acute  care facility for treatment  to prevent  prolonged  seizures.[2 ] 
If treatment  is not prompt  and effective  there is a risk that seizure  activity  will continue,  
and may become  life threatening,  including  the risk of status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].[3 ,4,5] 
In these  cases,  the primary  goals  of the treatment  are seizure  cessation  and prevention  of 
seizure recurrence.[1 ] Usually, acute benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541884]. Nevertheless, many treatment 
options rely on appropriate intervention by [CONTACT_80348], and treatment may be  
delayed  while the patient is transported  to a medical  facility.[ 6] 
Outpatient treatment for these types of seizures may reduce emergency medical  
intervention,  decrease seizure duration,  prevent  general  deterioration  due to the repeated  
seizures and improve the quality of life of these patients. While rectal diazepam gel is  
currently  available  in the United  States  (US),  a portion  of the population  does  not benefit  
from this treatment partly because the rectal route of administration is in appropriate or  
unacceptable.[7 ] Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for an effective treatment  
with a rapid  onset  of action  that is easily  administered  in the outpatient  setting.  
4.2. Diazepam  
Diazepam  is a long- acting "classical"  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541885] 
γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)  at the (GABA) -A receptor  and demonstrates  anticonvulsant 
properties.  It is commonly  used to treat a range  of conditions  including  seizures,  anxiety,  
alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80301], muscle spasms,  
trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and restless legs syndrome.[8 ] It can be taken by [CONTACT_1966], inserted into  
the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected intraveno usly. When given intravenously,  
effects begin in one to five minutes. When diazepam is taken orally, effects may be  
delayed  as long as 40 minutes.[9 ] 
Intravenous  diazepam  is a first- line treatment for status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397].[9 ] Diazepam  gel has 
been  demonstrated  superior  to placebo  gel in reducing  the risk of continuing seizures.  
Diazepam is rarely used for the long -term treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541886].[9 ] However,  
diazepam is effective when used intermittently for the prevention of repeated seizures. 
Like other benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  diazepam  administration  may cause sedation, anxiolysis, and 
amnesia.[ 9] 
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707001] that diazepam acts to suppress seizures 
through an interaction with γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors of the A -type 
(GABA A). GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, 
acts at this receptor to open the membrane channel allowing chloride ions to flow into  
neurons  [10]. Entry  of chloride ions causes  an inhibitory  potential  that reduces  the ability  
of neurons  to depolarize to the threshold  potential  necessary  to produce  action potentials.  
Excessive depolarization of neurons is implicated in the generation and spread of 
seizures.  It is believed  that diazepam  enhances  the actions  of GABA by [CONTACT_541970] A receptor.  
4.2.2.  Metabolism  and Elimination  
Diazepam is extensively metabolized to one major active metabolite 
(desmethyldiazepam) and two minor active metabolites, 3 -hydroxydiazepam 
(temazepam) and 3- hydroxy-N- diazepam (oxazepam) [11 ]. With steady state dosing,  
desmethyldiazepam  is found  in plasma  at concentrations equivalent  to those  of diazepam  
while oxazepam  and temazepam  are not usually  detectable.  The metabolism  of diazepam  
is primarily hepatic and involves demethylation (involving primarily CYP2C19 and  
CYP3A4) and 3 hydroxylation (involving primarily CYP3A4), followed by  
[CONTACT_12075]. The marked inter- individual variability in the clearance of diazepam  
reported in the literature is probably attributable to variability of CYP2C19 (which is 
known to exhibit genetic polymor phism; about 3- 5% of Caucasians have little or no 
CYP2C19 activity and are “poor metabolizers”) and CYP3A4. No inhibition was  
demonstrated in the presence of inhibitors selective for CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6,  
CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, indicating that these enzymes are not significantly involved in  
metabolism  of diazepam  [12]. 
 
4.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
Per the prescribing information, rectal administration of a 15 mg dose of Diastat®  
AcuDial™ rectal gel produces peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 hours, with absolute  
bioavailability of 90% relative to Valium® injectable. The volume of distribution of  
diazepam  rectal gel is calculated  to be approximately  1 L/kg.  The mean  elimination half- 
life of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam following administration of a 15 mg dose of diazepam  rectal  gel was found  to be about  46 hours  (coefficient  of variation  [CV] = 43%)  
and 71 hours  (Coefficient  of Variation  [CV]  = 37%),  respectively.  Both  diazepam  and its 
major active  metabolite  desmethyldiazepam  bind extensively  to plasma  proteins
 
(95-98%).  
 
4.3. Diastat® AcuDial™ 
Although the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal  gel formulation  is considered  generally  safe and 
effective,  the route  of administration  is less than ideal.  The mechanics  of administering  a 
rectal gel can be a difficult, time -consuming, and embarrassing experience for both  
patient and care- givers  alike.  For example,  the patient  or care- giver  must  first remove  
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707002] the patient in an appropriate position. The Diastat®  
AcuDial™  rectal  gel syringe  tip is inserted  into the rectum  to a specific depth  and the gel 
expressed into the rectal vault. However, improper technique can lead to patient injury  
and leakage of gel from the rectum can result in incomplete dosing and the need for an  
additional dose to compensate for any loss. Additionally, the attitude of som e patients  
toward  a rectal route  of drug administration  is unfavorable  which  may negatively  impact  
compliance to treatment.[13] Each of these factors has a potential influence on patient  
morbidity. Persistent seizure activity is associated with worse outcomes across a  
spectrum of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_80303].[ 14,15] Further, it has been demonstrated that if  
seizures are not terminated  quickly,  escalating  doses  of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541887].[ 16] 
 
4.4. Diazepam  Buccal  Film  (DBF)  
The new route of diazepam administration is via buccal soluble film. Buccal soluble 
diazepam may be particularly well- suited for administration in outpatient settings. The  
study drug is administered by [CONTACT_80351], where  it adheres,  and allows for transbuccal  absorption  of diazepam.  There  is no need  to 
position  or disrobe  the subject.  Additionally,  there  is less potential  for delay  in treatment  
and greater subject and caregiver acceptance with improved compliance may be expected.
 
The development of DBF will mee t the treatment need for a form of diazepam that is  
effective,  safe,  allows  for reliable  dose  administration,  and is easier  to administer  than the 
rectal gel in a subset of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541888]. Subjects, caregivers, and physicians have  
indicated  that this type of product  would  be desirable  for acute,  intermittent  treatment  of 
breakthrough,  repetitive  or cluster  seizures.  The clinical trials with DBF  have  focused  on 
assessing its relative bioavailability to the reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal  
gel, dose proportionality,  assessment of food effect,  and the pharmacokinetics  in subjects 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]. Overall safety and tolerability have been assessed in all cl inical trials  
conducted  with DBF.  
Aquestive Therapeutics initiated development of DBF, specifically intended for buccal  
delivery for subjects who require control of intermittent bouts of seizure activity. DBF  
contains the Food  and Drug Administration  (FDA)  approved active ingredient  diazepam,  
a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  as a treatment for the management  of selected,  refractory  subjects  with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], on stable regimens of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_541889]. The study drug, with a planned  
dose range of 5 mg to 17.5 mg, is expected to achieve peak plasma concentrations of  
diazepam equivalent to the reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel. The DBF  
product is intended for submission as a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) using 
Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel as the reference  therapy.  
4.5. Background on Diazepam  Buccal  Film  (DBF)  
Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal  gel is prescribed for increased  seizure  activity  as defined  by a 
marked  increase in seizure activity,  sometimes heralded  by [CONTACT_105]-convulsive  symptoms  
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707003] and deemed by [CONTACT_541971] a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541890]  (Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal  gel 
Prescribing Information). Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel has been marketed in the US  
since  1997 and currently is the only FDA  approved drug in the US for this indication.  
Though the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel formulation  is considered  safe and effective,  the 
route  of administration  is less than ideal.  The mechanics  of administering  a rectal  gel can 
be a difficult, time -consuming, and embarrassing experience for both subject and care- 
givers alike. For example, the subject or caregiver must first remove articles of clothing  
and then place the subject in an appropriate position. The Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel  
syringe tip is inserted into the rectum to a specific depth and the gel expressed into the 
rectal vault. How ever, improper technique can lead to subject injury, and leakage of gel  
from the rectum can result in incomplete dosing. Additionally, some subjects have a  
negative view of the rectal route of administration, and this may reduce compliance to  
treatment.[ 13] Each  of these  factors  has a potential  influence  on subject  morbidity.  
Persistent seizure activity is associated  with less favorable  outcomes  across a spectrum  of 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_80303].[ 14,15] Further,  it has been  demonstrated  that if seizures  are not 
terminated quickly, escalating doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541891].[ 15] 
The DBF is intended for application to the inner aspect of the cheek where it adheres, dissolves, and releases the drug into the buccal mucosa. Though buccal absorption is 
expected as the primary route of absorption of the drug, some absorption through 
gastrointestinal  (GI) tract may be possible  due to swallowing  of the saliva.  It is expected  
that that use of the buccal  film will be similar  to the use of Diastat
® AcuDial™ rectal gel, 
i.e., the film would be administered after a seizure with characteristics for which the  
Reference Listed  Drug  (RLD)  would be indicated.  
 
4.5.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
Mechanism of Action: Although the precise mechanism by [CONTACT_541972]-seizure  effects is unknown,  animal  and in vitro  studies  suggest  that diazepam  acts to 
suppress seizures through  an interaction  with GABA receptors  of the A-type (GABA A). 
GABA,  the major  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  in the central nervous  system,  acts at this 
receptor  to open  the membrane  channel  allowing  chloride  ions to flow  into neurons.  
Entry  of chloride  ions causes  an inhibitory  potential  that reduces the ability  of neurons  to 
depolarize to the threshold potential necessary to produce action potentials. Excessive  
depolarization of neurons is implicated in the generation and spread of seizures. It is 
believed that diazepam enhances the actions of GABA by [CONTACT_541973] A receptor.  
Metabolism and Elimination: It has been reported in the literature that diazepam is  
extensively metabolized to one major active metabolite (desmethyldiazepam) and two  
minor  active  metabolites,  3-hydroxydiazepam (temazepam) and 3-hydroxy-N- diazepam  
(oxazepam). With steady state dosing, desmethyldiazepam is found in plasma at  
concentrations equivalent  to those of diazepam  while oxazepam  and temazepam  are not 
usually detectable. The metabolism of diazepam is primarily hepatic and involves 
demethylation (involving  primarily  CYP2C19  and CYP3A4)  and 3-hydroxylation

(involving primarily CYP3A4), followed by [CONTACT_12075]. The marked inter- 
individual variability in the clearance of diazepam reported in the literature is probably 
attributable to variability  of CYP2C19  (which is known  to exhibit  genetic  polymorphism;  
about 3- 5% of Caucasians have little or no CYP2C19 activity and are “poor 
metabolizers”) and CYP3A4. No inhibition was demonstrated in the presence of inhibitors selective for CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, indicating  
that these  enzymes  are not significantly  involved in metabolism  of diazepam.
 
 
4.5.2.  Clinical Studies  
As of [ADDRESS_707004] been completed: two  
bioavailability/bioequivalence studies (Study numbers 1899 and 1900), a dose - 
proportionality study  (Study  number  162013),  a fasting pi[INVESTIGATOR_541892]®  gel (Study  number  162021)  and two food  effect  studies (high  
and moderate  fat) in healthy  subjects (Study  numbers  162022  and 172018).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety in Clinical  Studies  
It is anticipated  that the adverse  event  (AE)  profile  from  systemic  exposure  observed  with 
study  drug will resemble  the already  well- known  profile  for diazepam  in general  and the 
reference therapy, Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel, in particular. Diazepam rectal gel AE  
data were collected from  double -blind,  placebo- controlled  studies  and open  label  studies  
with 573 subjects  exposed to diazepam  rectal  gel.[11] The majority  of AEs were  mild  to 
moderate in severity and transient. The most frequent AE reported with diazepam rectal  
gel in the two double -blind, placebo -controlled studies was somnolence (23%). Less  
frequent AEs were headache (≤5%), diarrhea (≤4%), ataxia (≤3%), dizziness (≤3%),  
euphoria (≤3%), incoordination (≤3%), rash (≤3%), vasodilatation (≤2%), and asthma (≤2%).
 
In the [ADDRESS_707005]  been  a total of 154 subjects  enrolled  and 132 
subjects (65.9%  male,  34.1%  female;  age range  19-64) having  received  at least  one dose  
of study drug. A total of 268 doses of DBF and 119 doses of Diastat® AcuDial™ were  
administered.  
Sixty -five percent of all administrations  of DBF (n = 175) and 63.9%  (n=78)  of Diastat  
administrations were followed by [CONTACT_541974] 
(TEAE). A total of 252 TEAEs were reported following administrations of DBF; the  
majority  were  mild (90.9%)  or moderate (8.3%)  in severity.  80.1%  were deemed  to be 
possibly or probably related to study drug. Of 103 TEAEs reported following Diastat  
doses,  98%were  mild and 2% were moderate.  75.7%  were possibly  or probably  related.  
There was 1 serious adverse event (SAE) reported and [ADDRESS_707006]  studies.  
Overall, the administration of DBF was safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects 
following a single oral dose of 5mg through 20 mg under various conditions. Adverse  
events  were  primarily  mild to moderate in severity,  short -lasting  and consistent  with the 
known pharmacologic  effects of diazepam.  There  were  few SAEs  reported  and no events  
associated  with death  or lasting  impairment  were observed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetics  in Clinical Studies  
Pharmacokinetics: Per the prescribing information, 15 mg dose of Diastat® AcuDial™  
rectal gel following rectal administration, produces peak plasma concentrations in 1.5  
hours,  with absolute  bioavailability  of 90% relative  to Valium®  injectable.  The volume  
of distribution  of diazepam  rectal  gel is calculated to be approximately  1 L/kg.  The mean  
elimination half -life of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam following administration of a  
15 mg dose of diazepam rectal gel was found to be about 46 hours, Coefficient of  
Variation (CV) =43% and 71 hours (CV=37%), respectively. Both diazepam and its  
major  active metabolite  desmethyldiazepam  bind extensively  to plasma proteins  
(95-98%).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_541893]  1899  and 1900  
The Sponsor conducted two randomized, open label, single -dose, fasting condition,  
crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_541894]®  AcuDial™  rectal  gel. 
The planned  enrolment was 12 subjects  in both studies.  
Study 1899 compared study drug 5 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel 5 mg. Among  
the 11 subjects who completed both treatments, DMSF 5 mg was bioequivalent to  
Diastat®  AcuDial™  rectal  gel [ADDRESS_707007] to area under  the plasma  concentration - 
time curve from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to time t (the time of the  
last quantifiable concentration) [AUC t] and AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC ∞). This 
was evidenced  by [CONTACT_941] 90% confidence  interval  (CI) for the ratio of geometric  means  was 
within the acceptable range of 80 -125%. For the maximum observed plasma  
concentration (Cmax), the ratio of geometric means  was 1.07 (90%  CI: 87.1-131.5%).  The 
median  time to reach C max (Tmax) was 0.67 hours  for DBF  (range  0.33-1.50 hours)  and 
0.25 hours  for the Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal  gel (range  0.15- 1.00 hours).  The difference  
in Tmax values  was not statistically  significant.  
Study 1900  compared  DBF  20 mg to Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal  gel 20 mg. Evaluable  data 
from  10 subjects who completed  both treatments  showed  that the extent  of the absorption  
of DBF  20 mg was comparable  to Diastat® AcuDial™ 20 mg rectal  gel, with the ratio of 
geometric means  for AUC t and AUC ∞ within the acceptable  range  of 80-125%.  For Cmax, 
the ratio of geometric means was 158.72% (90% CI 122.81 -205.14). The median T max 
was 1.25 hours  for the DBF  (range  0.36- 2.05 hours)  and 1.00 hours  for the Diastat®

AcuDial™ rectal gel (range 0.25- 2.00 hours). The difference in T max values was not 
statistically  significant.  Examination of the mean  plasma  curves  for DSBF  and Diastat® 
AcuDial™ showed that although  the Cmax was higher  for the DSBF  relative  to Diastat® 
AcuDial™, the pharmacokinetics were  comparable  in terms of rapid  rate of absorption,  
duration  of plateau,  and the rate of elimination.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Study  162013 – Dose -Proportionality  
Study 162013 was a single -dose, randomized, open -label, three- period, six- sequence,  
crossover  study  conducted  to assess  dose -proportionality  of DBF  at doses  of 5, 10, and 15 
mg. A total of 30 subjects were randomized and dosed in the study. Analysis of the  
pharmacokinetic  data confirmed  that DBF  is dose -proportional  over the dose range  5 mg 
to 15 mg (Table  1). The criteria  for dose  proportionality were met for diazepam  since  for 
both comparisons (A/B: DBF 5 mg/DBF 10 mg and C/B: DBF 15 mg/DBF 10 mg), the  
geometric mean 90% CI of the ratios of Least- Squares means from the analysis of  
variance (ANOVA) of the ln -transformed AUC t, AUC ∞, and C max were within the  
acceptable range  80-125%.

crossover  in 36 healthy  adult  males  and females.  The four treatments  were  DBF  15 mg 
and three doses of Diastat® AcuDial™ rectal gel: 5 mg, 12.5 mg, and 20 mg. These  
Diastat® AcuDial™ doses  span  the approved  dose  range  for the rectal  gel. The objective 
of this study was to gain a thorough and precise understanding of the comparative 
exposure to diazepam and nordiazepam (both AUC and C max) after administration of 
DBF  or Diastat® AcuDial™.

Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC t, and AUC ∞) were compared  pairwise.  DBF  
15 mg with each  of the three  doses  of the rectal  gel (Table  2). The results  suggest  that the 
dose of DBF expected to match the diazepam C max following 20 mg Diastat® 
AcuDial™gel is lower than 12.5 mg (closer to 11 mg); the dose expected to match the 
diazepam Cmax following a 12.5 mg dose of Diastat® AcuDial™gel is lower than 9 mg;  
and the dose of DBF expected to match the diazepam Cmax following a 5 mg dose of  
Diastat® AcuDial™gel is lower  than 5 mg (closer to 4 mg).  Results demonstrate  that AUC 
(both AUC t and AUC ∞) are dose proportional following single doses for both DBF and  
for Diastat® AcuDial™gel over the studied dose. These results, normalized for dose in  
mg, suggest that the relative bioavailability of diazepam administered as DMSF  
compared  with Diastat® AcuDial™ gel is 118%  to 128%.

[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Food  Effect Studies  
Aquestive Therapeutics conducted  two food  effect studies  (Study  162022  in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4.1 and Study  172018  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4.2 ). Results  for a high fat meal  
were  consistent  across  the two studies.  
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707010] on diazepam AUC but reduces diazepam C max on 
average of 45% and 33%, respectively. Bimodal peaks were observed under fed 
conditions due to the combination of oral transmucosal absorption and intestinal  
absorption of DBF. The first peak (mean concentration curves) for both high fat and  
moderate  fat meals  is observed  at 45 minutes  (mean  of 199.04  ng/mL  and 222.37  ng/mL,  
respectively)  and the second  peak  of the mean  concentration  curves  is observed  at 3 hours  
(mean  of 196.22 ng/mL  and 261.79 ng/mL,  respectively).  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.1.  Study 162022  
Study 162022 was a single -dose, open -label,  two-period, randomized  two-sequence  
crossover  study  with DBF  15 mg administered  under  fasted  conditions  and within  
30 minutes  following  a high- fat meal.  The washout  period  between doses  was 28 days.  
The study  was conducted  with 18 healthy  male and female  subjects  aged  18 to 62 years,  
inclusive. AUC t and AUC ∞ were not affected by [CONTACT_8208]; however, C max after a high fat  
meal was approximately 55% of the fasting value, 90% CI 48.6% – 62.7% (ratio of  
geometric means).  Median  Tmax fasting  was approximately  0.75 hour  with range  of 
0.25 hour  to 2 hours  whereas  median  Tmax after  a high fat meal  was 3.0 hours  with range  
0.5 hour to 6.0 hours,  p = 0.0008.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.2.  Study 172018  
Study 172018  was a four-period,  randomized  four-sequence  crossover  study  in 24 male  
and female adults with four treatments:  (A) DBF  15 mg fasted,  administered  upright;  (B) 
DBF 15 mg fasted, administered reclining; DBF 15 mg within 30 minutes following a  
standardized  high- fat meal,  administered  reclining;  and DBF  [ADDRESS_707011] reclining on his/her side (application site downward) for 15 minutes after  
application.  This was based  on aligning  treatment administration  with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_541896] a postictal state and the Sponsor’s interest in investigating  
whether  position  affected  diazepam  PK following  administration  of DBF.  
Analysis comprised  pairwise comparisons of Treatment C (high -fat meal,  reclining)  and 
Treatment D (moderate- fat meal,  reclining) with Treatment  B (fasting,  reclining)  as well 
as a comparison between Treatment B (fasting, reclining) with Treatment A (fasting,  
upright).  
Overall,  AUC t and AUC ∞ were not affected  by [CONTACT_541975].  Cmax after  the high 
fat meal (reclining) was approximately 53% of the fasting value (reclining), 90% CI:  
41.1% - 59.5% (ratio of geometric means). C max after the moderate fat meal (reclining) 
was approximately 67% of the fasting  value  (reclining),  90% CI 59.8%  - 74.6%  (ratio  of 
geometric means). Comparison of Treatment B with Treatment A demonstrated that 
position in the fasting condition (reclining versus upright) had no meaningful effect on 
either C maxor AUC. Diazepam profiles (reclining versus upright) met bioequivalence  
criteria for the upright  and fasting  condition.  There was no difference  in Tmax, p = 0.4979.

Median  Tmax fasting,  upright  was 1.00 hour  with range  0.28 hour  to 2.03 hours.  Median  
Tmax fasting,  reclining  was 0.80 hour with range  0.50 hour to 2.03 hours  whereas  median  
Tmax after a high fat meal, reclining was 2.01 hours with range 0.50 hour to 4.06 hours  
(p = 0.0147 versus fasting, reclining). and median T max after a moderate fat meal,  
reclining  was 3.00 hours  with range  0.50 hour to 4.02 hours  (p = 0.0005  versus  fasting,  
reclining).  
4.6. Rationale for the Dose Regimen  of Diazepam  Buccal  Film  
As described above, the data from Study 162013 and Study 162021 demonstrate that  
DBF is dose -proportional over the studied dose -range, while Diastat® AcuDial™ is less  
than dose -proportional with respect to C max. Also, as described above, the data from  
Study 162022  and Study  172018  demonstrate  that food  taken  within  30 minutes  prior  to 
dosing affects the rate (but not the extent) of absorption of diazepam administered as  
DBF.  Accordingly,  Aquestive  used population PK modeling  to select  a dosing  regimen  to 
compensate for the differences in PK between  DBF  and Diastat® AcuDial™ (Table  4; 
Section  8.1).  
Using data from Study 162013, Study 162021, and Study 172018, population PK  
modeling was used to model the PK profiles for DBF and Diastat® AcuDial™ under  
fasted and fed conditions (DBF). In brief, the recommended DBF dose for each weight  
class as defined in the Diastat® AcuDial™ label was selected (1) to provide a dose 
sufficiently high to ensure that the predicted median of the resulting diazepam C max 
following  a moderate  fat meal  was similar  to the median  Cmax following  the labeled  dose  
of Diastat® AcuDial™, and (2) to provide a dose for which the predicted median of the  
resulting diazepam C max under fasting conditions would not exceed the median C max 
values observed and demonstrated as safe in Phase 1 studies with DBF. It was  
demonstrated  that the predicted median  diazepam  Cmax values  with the proposed  regimen  
administered under fasting conditions did not meaningfully exceed the median C max 
values observed in the 115 healthy  volunteers  (adult men and women)  who received  DBF  
15 or 20 mg under fasting conditions in Phase 1 studies conducted Aquestive. The  
median  Cmax among  these  115 healthy  subjects  (138  DBF  administrations)  was 
486 ng/mL.  Under  conditions  of a moderate fat meal,  the proposed  DBF  dosing  regimen  
produces  a C max similar  to the Cmax expected  following  the labeled  dose  of Diastat® 
AcuDial™. 
Population PK modeling using data from healthy adults demonstrated that diazepam  
exposure  following DBF  (like Diastat)  is dependent  on body  size. In the adult  population,  
it was demonstrated that a weight- based dose regimen based on modeling produced  
exposures  that were uniform  across  weight  classes  and these  exposures  in higher  weight  
subjects following a 17.[ADDRESS_707012] will be

determined  using the regimen  employed  in study 160325 ( Table  5).The  proposed dosing 
regimen, under conditions of a moderate fat meal, is expected to produce C max values  
similar to the Cmax expected following  the labeled  dose of Diastat.  
4.7. Clinical Risks/Benefits  of Study Drug  
4.7.1.  Managing Clinical  Risks/Benefits  in the Current Study  
The available data indicate that study drug is dose proportional over the studied dose - 
range,  while  Diastat® AcuDial™ is less than dose  proportional  with respect  to Cmax. The 
data suggest  that study drug and Diastat® AcuDial™ are approximately  bioequivalent  at 
the 5 mg dose,  and that C max values  for study drug  exceed  Cmax from  Diastat® AcuDial™ 
as the dose  increases  beyond  5 mg. 
In this study,  dose  is based  on age and weight  category  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  8.3). 
Note that subjects are to be weighed at screening and at each study visit, and dose 
dispensed  will be adjusted  depending  on age and weight  category  at that visit 
(Section  8.3). Study  drug  dosing is determined  first according  to age group and then by 
[CONTACT_541976]. The Investigator may make adjustments as medically  
indicated.  For all age groups,  the height,  weight,  and body  mass  index  (BMI; kg/m2) will 
be measured  and recorded  at all study visits.  The rationale  for the dose regimen  for DBF  
is explained  in Section  4.6. 
The subjects  in this study  will be administering  study  drug themselves  or with the help of 
a caregiver, (trained by [CONTACT_541977])  in the same  setting  as they typi[INVESTIGATOR_541897], without the presence of study staff. The study design includes study  
site visits to monitor safety and tolerability, assess subject/caregiver use of study drug  
through review of subject/caregiver diaries, ensure adequate supply of study drug dose,  
and reinforce subject/caregiver training on the use of study drug, with a focus on safety  
and correct  study  conduct.  Since the dosing  is weight  based,  the subjects’ drug  inventory  
will be reviewed  at each study  visit and reissued  with the correct  dosage,  based  on body  
weight.  
 
4.7.2.  Overdosage Information Derived  from  Diastat®  AcuDial™  Prescribing  
Information  
According  to the prescribing  information  for Diastat®  AcuDial™  rectal  gel (December  
2016), previous reports of diazepam overdosage have shown that manifestations of diazepam overdosage include somnolence, confusion, coma, and diminished reflexes.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored, as in all cases of drug  
overdosage,  although,  in general,  these  effects  have  been  minimal.  General supportive  
measures should be employed, along with intravenous fluids, and an adequate airway  
maintained.  Hypotension  may be combated  by [CONTACT_541978].  
Dialysis  is of limited  value.
 
Flumazenil,  a specific  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]- receptor  antagonist,  is indicated  for the complete  
or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541898] a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541899].  Prior  to the

substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80311]. Subjects treated wi th 
flumazenil should  be monitored for re-sedation,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_541900].  The prescriber should  be

6. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
6.1. Description of  Overall  Study  Design  and Plan 
This Phase  3, multicenter,  open -label,  long- term safety  and tolerability  study  of chronic,  
intermittent  use of DBF  (study  drug).  
The study population will be male and female children (2 to 12 years old), adolescents  
(13 to 16 years old), and adults (17 to 65 years old) with a clinical diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541904],  ARS,  frequent breakthrough  seizures,  seizure 
clusters, or cluster seizures and who are on chronic, intermittent use of a rescue  
medication  (e.g.,  Diastat® AcuDial™ or other  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]).  
It is expected that approximately 120 subjects ( ∼60 children and adolescents and ∼60 
adults) will be screened  and approximately  100 subjects (50 children  and adolescents  and 
50 adults) are expected  to enroll.  The enrollment  should  include  at least 20 subjects  in the 
6- to 11-year- old group  and 20 subjects  in the 12- to 16-year-old group.  
Subjects  who initially  consented  and enrolled  in the study  under  version  1 of the protocol  
dated 31 July 2017 may come in at their next scheduled site visit, reconsent under the 
amended protocol and be dispensed a new container of DBF based upon the revised  
mg/kg  dosing  in Table  4. The subjects  do not need  to come  in for unscheduled  visit.  
In addition  to direct enrollment  of subjects  from  screening,  subjects  who have  completed  
the Phase 2 clinical trials (Study 160325 [Pediatric] and Study 160326 [Adult]) may  
screen and enroll (i.e., rollover subjects) into this Phase 3 long -term safety study when  
they come for their follow -up visit in the Phase 2 study. Seizure diary used during the 
Phase 2 studies will be reviewed  at screening  for this rollover  subjects.  Rollover  subjects 
will be assessed  using  Protocol  42-1703  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  The Phase  [ADDRESS_707014]  will be a minimum  of 6 months  (Figure  1). Subject  
study visits will occur at Baseline, within [ADDRESS_707015] seizure prompting study  
drug administration,  and approximately  every  3 months  (± 14 days)  over the course  of the 
study.  All visits  are calculated  from  the time of the Baseline Visit/Study  Day 1. 
The planned  end date for this study  is [ADDRESS_707016] Baseline Visit/Study Day [ADDRESS_707017]  
planned  Study  Completion  Visit/Visit  [ADDRESS_707018] will be completed by 09 October 2020. Subjects who are  
ongoing  on 28 February  2020,  who are benefitting  from  the use of DBF,  and who would  
like to stay on study,  will be allowed  to continue  until  study  end.

Subjects  who  are ongoing  on 28 February  2020,  who  are benefitting  from  the use of DBSF,  and who  would  like to stay on 
study,  will be allowed  to continue  until  study  end.  
 
The study  site visits will be conducted  to assess  protocol -defined  safety  variables 
(Section  5.2). 
Administration  and usability  of study  drug will be recorded  at home  in the electronic  
diary  after  each  use of study drug.  The electronic  diary  will also be used  at home  to 
capture seizure history  and changes  in health  and medications.  
The study  drug  dose will be tailored  to the subject’s  age and body  weight,  as described  in 
Section  8.1, and adjusted  throughout  the study  period  if changes  in body weight  call for 
dose modification.  For all age groups,  the height  and weight  will be recorded  at all study  
visits. Study drug dosing is determined first according to age group and then by [CONTACT_541981]. Subjects with weights in the range 112 to 134 kg (247 to 295  
pounds)  may be allowed  to participate  in the study  at the discretion  of the Investigator.  
Table 4 provides the calculated prescribed DBF dose for DBF naive subjects (i.e., those 
who entered into the present study 42 -1703 never having received DBF as study drug 
before). The Investigator is encouraged to use Table [ADDRESS_707020] response  to the study  drug 
dose and the Investigator's judgment. Subjects already enrolled in the present study [ADDRESS_707021] response to the study drug dose and the

Study drug  will be administered  away  from  the study  site, by [CONTACT_356967], if applicable.  
by a caregiver, both trained in study drug administration and documentation using the  
electronic diary. This is expected to be in the home most often but could also occur in a  
non-clinical  environment  outside  of the home.  The subject  and/or  caregiver  will be: 
• able to recognize  the occurrence  of a qualifying  event  that for the individual  
subject is characteristic and is deemed by [CONTACT_2418] a kind for

Investigators will be allowed to make adjustments to subjects’ anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_541906],  with the aim to control  seizures,  and reduce  increased  
bouts  of seizure  frequency,  as will be expected  in the general  practice  of medicine.  
Screening Period: The last Screening Visit is [ADDRESS_707024]’s legally authorized representative and oral and/or written  
assent  will be obtained  from  the subject as required  by [CONTACT_312134]  
(IRB).  
As a part of screening, potential subjects and caregivers will be advised that electronic 
diaries  will be used  by [CONTACT_541983]/or  caregivers  to document  seizures,  use of study drug,  
AEs,  changes in concomitant  medication  to determine  their  ability/willingness  to use the 
electronic diary during treatment. Training on the use of the diary will not be performed  
until  the baseline  visit.  
Subjects may be re-screened  during  the study  per Investigator judgment  after consultation  
with and approval  by [CONTACT_46449].  
Baseline Visit (Study Day 1) – conducted after completion of screening and  
confirmation of eligibility for study enrollment determined by [CONTACT_541984] (Section 7.1 ) and Exclusion ( Section 7.2 ) criteria. During the baseline visit at 
the study  site, the subjects  will undergo  baseline assessments  and subjects/caregivers will 
receive training in study drug administration  and use of electronic  diary,  and receive  their  
study  drug supply  with documentation  materials  (IFU  [Appendix B ]). 
The last Baseline  Visit/Study  Day 1 will occur  no later than 06 March  2020.  
Subjects/caregivers will be instructed  to call the site when  the first seizure  prompts  study  
drug administration.  A study  site visit will occur  within  [ADDRESS_707025] of procedures  scheduled  for Study  Day 1. 
Treatment Period Clinical Site Visits : Upon completion of the Baseline visit, the  
subject enters a 6- month  minimum  period  of study  drug  treatment  with an expectation  
that the subject will use the study  drug  at least  [ADDRESS_707026] study drug dosing  and 
then approximately every 3 months (± 14 days) after the Baseline Visit (Study Day  
1/Visit  2). 
See Section  9.2.[ADDRESS_707027] seizure  prompting  study  drug  administration.  
Subjects will bring their diary and their supply of study drug to each study site visit. 
Subjects’  height  and weight  (without  shoes  and with empty  pockets)  will be obtained  at 
each site visit for determination  of study  drug dose  (Section  8). The subject  diary  will be 
reviewed,  and subject/caregiver  training  will be reinforced  (Section  9.2.2 ). Review  of

study  diary  use will include  the number  of study  drug  uses,  study  drug  usability  
assessment,  seizure- control  status,  AEs,  and concomitant medications.  
Subjects will undergo assessment of oral mucosal health, gustatory assessment, vital 
signs,  physical and neurological examination,  collection  of blood  and urine  samples  for 
clinical laboratory testing, 12 -lead ECG, age -appropriate Quality of Life (QoL) and  
Columbia  Suicide  Severity Rating  Scale  (C-SSRS)  assessments.  
The QoL and C -SSRS should be completed in a ppropriately aged subjects. These  
assessments may be omitted as applicable if a subject's cognitive status does not allow  
the subject to personally  complete  the assessment.  The site must  document  in the source  
documents the reason that these assessments cannot be completed (e.g., unable to  
perform  test due to incapacity,  etc.).  
See Section  9.2.[ADDRESS_707028] at 1 Month and 2 Months After Study Day 1: The 
study  site staff will telephone  the subjects  at approximately 1 and 2 months  ± [ADDRESS_707029]’s health and seizure status, determine if stud y 
drug was used  reinforce  training  on study  drug administration  and diary  documentation,  
and to address concerns.

contacts  at Month  1 and Month 2. 
Final/Completion  or Early  Withdrawal Visit  
The last subject  Study  Completion  Visit/Visit  5 is projected  for 02 September  2020.  
• For those  subjects  who have  exceeded  [ADDRESS_707031]  may complete  the study  at the 6-month visit (Visit  5) per 
the protocol,  or the subject  may continue  as described  below.  
• For those  subjects  who have  at least [ADDRESS_707032]  may complete  the study at the 6-month  visit (Visit 5) per 
the protocol,  or the subject  may continue  as described  below.  
Subjects who prematurely  withdraw  from  the study  for any reason  should  undergo  a final  
visit as well.  If the Early Withdrawal  Visit  is not done,  the reason(s)  will be recorded  in 
the eCRF. Assessments/procedures performed at the final visit are the same as those  
performed  during  Treatment  Period  Clinical Site Visits.  In addition:  
• Unused  study  drug  will be returned,  and the electronic  study diary  will be 
collected.  For subjects  completing  the study  at 6 months,  the 6-month  visit 
serves  as the Final/Completion Visit.  
See Section  9.2.[ADDRESS_707033] 30-37 days after the Final/Completion Visit:

Extension  of Study  Beyond  Month 6: 
The duration  of treatment  is being  extended  beyond  [ADDRESS_707036] may continue  in the study  while  
the study  remains  open.  
In order  to continue:  
• The subject  is using the Investigational  Product  
• The subject is receiving  benefit from  the Investigational  Product  
• The subject  is tolerating the Investigational  Product  
• The subject wishes  to continue  in the study  
If a subject has had 3 or more  uses of DBF,  subjects  may complete  the study at the 6- 
month  visit (Visit 5) per protocol  or the subject may continue  as described  above.  
If a subject  has not had 3 uses of DBF  at the 6-month  visit (Visit 5), or any visit after that, 
the Investigator should strongly consider the likelihood of the subject using DBF and  
whether the subject should continue in the study. The Investigator may consult with the 
Medical  Monitor,  if needed,  to assess  on a case-by-case basis  the likelihood  of achieving  
[ADDRESS_707037]’s  participation can be extended  with a 
similar  schedule  of assessments.  If the assessment  concludes  that achieving  [ADDRESS_707038].  
 
6.2. Rationale for Study  Design  
The subjects in this study  will be administering  study  drug  themselves or with the help of 
a caregiver (trained  by [CONTACT_541985])  in 
the same setting as they typi[INVESTIGATOR_541907],  
without  the presence  of study  staff.  The study design  includes  study site visits  to monitor  
safety and tolerability, assess subject/caregiver use of study drug through review of  
electronic diaries, ensure adequate supply of study drug dose, and reinforce 
subject/caregiver training on the use of study drug, with a focus on safety and correct  
study  conduct.  Since  dosing is weight- based,  the subject’s  drug inventory  will be

7. SELECTION  AND WITHDRAWAL  OF SUBJECTS  
Male and female subjects with a clinical diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541908] (e.g., ARS, frequent breakthrough seizures, seizure clusters or cluster  
seizures) will be screened.  Subjects may be re-screened  during  the study  per Investigator  
judgment after consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_1689]. Approximately  
[ADDRESS_707040] a minimum of 100 enrolled  
subjects (50 adult  and 50 pediatric/adolescent subjects).  The enrollment  should include  at 
least [ADDRESS_707041]  completed  the Phase 2 
clinical trials (Study  160325  [Pediatric]  and Study 160326  [Adult]) may screen  and enroll  
(i.e., rollover  subjects)  into this Phase 3 long- term  safety  study  when  they come  for their  
follow -up visit in the Phase 2 study.  Seizure diary  used during  the Phase  2 studies will be 
reviewed  at screening  for this rollover  subjects.  Rollover  subjects  will be assessed  using 
Protocol 42 -1703 inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Phase [ADDRESS_707042]  meet all the following  criteria in order  to be included  in the study:  
1. Female  or male  between  the ages of [ADDRESS_707043]’s  
legally authorized  representative  and oral and/or  written  assent  will be obtained 
from  the subject  as required  by [CONTACT_94158] (IRB) prior  to the 
performance  of any study -related  procedure  
3. Caregiver,  if needed  for subject,  provides  written  informed  consent  and is able to 
administer  study  drug in the event  of a seizure  
4. Subject has an established diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_541909],  and while on a regimen  of anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_541910](s),  still 
experiences bouts  of seizures (frequent break through  seizures,  e.g., ARS or seizure  
clusters) and who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may need benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541911]  [ADDRESS_707044] 1 concomitant anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_58786] (AED) at screening.  
The study  is open  to subjects  who,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2819],  would  benefit  
from use of study drug. Concomitant prescription for a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541912]  
(including diazepam) at screening or ongoing, or concomitant use of a  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541913] a part of the subject’s daily antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_541914] a subject from eligibility. Subjects are to be encouraged to use  
study  drug when  a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541915].  However,  treatment  
decisions  are to be guided  in all cases  according  to the Investigator’s  judgment  as to 
the optimal treatment  in the interest  of the subject’s  care and welfare.  Participation  
in this study is nev er a basis for the withholding of any treatment considered to be  
indicated  in the interest  of the subject.

Investigator’s discretion),  positive  blood screen  for human  immunodeficiency  virus  
(HIV),  hepatitis  B surface  antigen  (HBsAg),  hepatitis  C, or a positive  test result for 
drugs of abuse or alcohol, except marijuana use for medicinal indications. When  
marijuana is or was used for medicinal indications in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_281902], it is not considered as drug abuse and the subject can be enrolled in  
states  where marijuana  is legal,  even  if the marijuana metabolites  are positive  in the 
urine. NOTE: In such a case, the marijuana product will be recorded as a  
concomitant  medication.  
 
7.3. Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement  of Subjects  
A subject  may voluntarily  withdraw  or be withdrawn  from  the study  at any time for 
reasons  including,  but not limited to, the following:  
• progressive  disease  
• unacceptable  toxicity  or AE 
• intercurrent illness:  a condition,  a condition,  injury,  or disease  unrelated  to the 
primary diagnosis that became apparent  during  treatment with study  drug  and 
necessitated  the subject's  termination  from  the study  
• general or specific changes in the subject's  condition  that renders  him/her  
ineligible for further treatment with study drug according to the 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
• subject or caregiver withdrawal of consent: At any time, a subject's  
participation in the study may terminate at his/her request or on the basis of  
the Investigator's clinical judgment.  The reason  for subject  withdrawal will be 
noted  on the electronic  case report  form  (eCRF)  
• protocol deviation: The subject's findings or conduct failed to meet the  
protocol  entry  criteria  or failed  to adhere  to the protocol  requirements  (e.g.,  
drug noncompliance,  failure to return  for defined number  of visits),  and the 
deviation in the judgment of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Sponsor  
warrants  premature  termination  from  the study.

including  safety  or low enrollment.  
7.4. Follow- up for Drug  Discontinuation/Subject Withdrawal from  
Study  
If a subject  discontinues study  treatment  with study  drug  and is withdrawn from  the study 
for any reason,  the study  site must promptly notify the clinical  research associate  (CRA).  
The date and the reason for study discontinuation must be recorded on the eCRF.  
Subjects who withdraw  prematurely are to be scheduled  and attend  an Early  Withdrawal  
Visit,  if possible,  and complete  all assessments.  
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study due to a TEAE or  
serious  TEAE,  the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed  until it resolves  (returns to 
normal  or baseline  values)  or stabilizes,  or until it is judged  by [CONTACT_541986].  
Once  a subject  is withdrawn  from  the study,  the subject  may not re-enter  the study.

8.1.2.  Description  of Study  Drug  
The study drug, DBF, contains the active ingredient diazepam incorporated into a 
polymer -based film matrix utilizing Aquestive Therapeutics PharmFilm® technology.  
For the purposes of this study, with a population ranging in age from [ADDRESS_707053]  will be provided  at the following strengths:  [ADDRESS_707054] of the cheek where the film  
immediately adheres and begins  to hydrate.  During the hydration  process,  the drug,  along  
with associated solubility enhancers, are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_541918]. The study drug doses up to 20 mg were tested in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_541919] (Study 1900). The inactiv e ingredient composition, the film dimensions,  
and the manufacturing process selected for study drug are based on the information  
gained from the development of the study drug and other film products produced by  
[CONTACT_80369] (ZUPLENZ® 4 and 8 mg and SUBOXONE® 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4  
mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3mg Sublingual Films). The study drug is a green  
rectangular  film.  
The primary package  used  for study  drug  is a polyester/foil  laminate  provided  by [CONTACT_541987] (Madison, WI). The material (product code RFE -013) is a multi -layer  
composite  consisting  of (1) a 12.2-micron  layer  of polyethylene  phthalate,  (2) a 
25.4- micron  layer of low-density polyethylene,  (3) an 8.9-micron  layer  of aluminum  foil, 
and (4) a 38.1- micron  layer  of low-density polyethylene,  and is heat sealed  at the edges.  
Each  pouch  contains one study  drug film.  
8.2. Labelling,  Maintenance  and Retention  of Study  Drug  
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that all drug supplies provided for the  
study are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and are  
suitable for human use. The Sponsor  will supply  an authorized clinical  supplies  vendor  
with a sufficient  quantity of the study  formulation(s)  to allow  completion  of this study,  
including some spares for replacement drugs. The clinical supply vendor will ship the  
packaged and labeled study  drugs  for each  participating  investigator  to the Pharmacy  or 
Investigator at the address specified on the Drug Enforcement Agency Controlled  
Substance  certificate.  
The study  drugs  will be sent to the Site Pharmacy  already  packed  in individual  unit-dose  
packages. Each unit -dose pouch will be labeled in English containing the Sponsor name  
(MonoSol Rx [now Aquestive Therapeutics])1, Protocol Number, Drug Name, Strength,  
Kit Identification Number, Subject Number, Lot Number, Route of Administration,  
Quantity  of Dosage  Units and a statement  “Caution: New  Drug  – Limited  by [CONTACT_541988] e and the kit label will include at minimum Sponsor Name [CONTACT_542026],  Drug  Name,  Strength,  Quantity  of Pouches,  Route  of Administration,  Lot 
 
[ADDRESS_707055] Number,  Investigator 
Name,  Directions for Use, Storage  Conditions,  and a statement  ‘Keep  out of reach  of 
children’.  
Upon receipt of the study  drugs,  the Investigator,  Pharmacist,  or designee  will inspect  the 
shipment to ensure study drugs are received in good condition. Study drug receipt and  
condition will be promptly registered in the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). 
The Investigator,  Pharmacist,  or designee  will ensure  records  of receipt  and dispensing  of 
study  drugs  supplied  are maintained  for the duration  of the study.  
The Investigator or designee will log into the IWRS to register the subject’s visit and  
have  the study  drug  kit numbers  assigned  to the subject.  Only these  kits will be removed  
from inventory. At study visit 2 (Baseline visit) a starter kit containing [ADDRESS_707056] should bring back the container with empty (used) and unused pouches at their  
next study  visit.  The container will not be re-dispensed.  
At the completion  of the study,  all unused study  drug,  will be retained  by [CONTACT_541989].  
8.3. Dosage Schedule  
Dosing  will occur  away  from  the study  site and administered  by [CONTACT_32596],  
if applicable.  The dosing time will be triggered by [CONTACT_541990] a qualifying  event  that 
for the individual  subject  is characteristic  and is deemed  by [CONTACT_541991] a kind 
for which a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541920].  The subject and/or  
caregiver will administer the study drug as described in the IFU, see Appendix B . The 
actu
al date and time of film placement will be documented  in the electronic  diary  by [CONTACT_541992].  
A second dose, when required, may be given within [ADDRESS_707057]/caregiver. No more than one  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_541921]  [ADDRESS_707058]  containing  diazepam  (e.g.,  Diastat® AcuDial™) except  as 
instructed  by a physician . 
Based  on subject  diagnosis  and history  (Inclusion  Criteria),  it is expected  that subjects  
will have  a minimum  of [ADDRESS_707059]  randomization;  however,  each  study  drug kit will have  a kit number  which  
will be documented. The Investigator may adjust the study drug dose as medically  
appropriate,  in accordance  with guidelines  provided  in Section  8.1. 
8.5. Treatment  Accountability  and Compliance  
The pharmacist or other designated individual will maintain records of study treatment  
with study  drug  delivered  to the study  site, the inventory at the site, the distribution to and 
use by [CONTACT_6992], and the return of materials to the clinical supply vendor for storage 
or disposal. These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers,  
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], in clinic temperature log, and unique code numbers assigned to the  
product  and study  subjects.  
At each visit after initiation of treatment with study drug, site staff will record  
compliance of subjects with their assigned regimen. Subjects will be instructed to bring  
their diaries and study  drug containers with unused/partially used/empty  pouches  back  for 
inspection at each study visit. Subjects are to be remin ded of the importance of 
compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on taking their study drug  
timed to occur during a qualifying seizure when it is safe to do so and maintaining the prescribed  minimum  interval  between  doses.
 
Investigators wi ll maintain records that document adequately that the subjects were  
provided with the correct study drug treatment kits and will reconcile the products  
received  from  the drug  dispensing  center.  Study  drug will not be returned  to the clinical  
supplies  vendor  until  accountability  has been  fully  monitored.  
Unused medication  must be returned  at each visit,  as compliance  will be assessed  by 
[CONTACT_541993].  Noncompliance  is defined:  
• taking  more  than 2 doses  for a single  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
• treating  a second  epi[INVESTIGATOR_541922] 5 days  
• treating  more than 5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_541923]  
• unaccounted for doses  
Discontinuation for noncompliance is at the Investigator’s discretion  and is to be noted  
on the eCRF.  
Study  drugs  may be administered  by a caregiver  (including  group  home  or school  
personnel)  trained to assist  with study  drug administration.  
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707060] occurring or detected during the study and/or

9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Table 6 outlines the timing of procedures and assessments to be performed throughout  
the study. All site visits and telephone contacts are calculated from the time of the  
Baseline Visit/Study  Day 1 with the exception  of the Final/Completion/Early Withdrawal  
Visit  which  is calculated  from  the time of the 6-month  visit.  
See Section  11 for additional  details  of study  procedures.  
NOTE: The schedule of procedures and assessments in this table assumes the subjects 
has experienced  [ADDRESS_707062] on study for an additional 3 months. Thus, for these  
subjects  who continue  on study,  the Day 180 (Month  6) visit would  entail  all procedures  
and assessments  performed  at the Day 90 (Month  3) visit including:  
• review  training subject/caregiver on timing  of study  drug  administration  and use 
of electronic diary  
• review  of study drug administration  (IFU)  
• providing  a new supply  of study  drug  
If the assessment  concludes  use of the study  drug is not likely,  the Sponsor  may elect  to 
end study  participation  for non-users prior  to end of study

††The  Alcohol  Breath  Test should  be completed  according to the schedule  of assessments in subjects  17 years  of age and older  (and in subjects  < 17 years  of age 
at the Investigator's  discretion).  If a subject  cannot  complete the assessment  or, if in the judgment  of the Investigator,  the subject's  exposure  to alcohol  is 
limited  as determined  by [CONTACT_541995],  incapacity,  etc., the site must  document  in the source documents  the reason  that the assessment  is not completed.  
If a subject  cannot  provide  a urine  sample for drug screen,  the same  policy  applies.  If a subject  cannot  provide a urine sample or, if in the judgment  of the 
Investigator,  the subject's  exposure to drugs  of abuse is limited  as determined  by [CONTACT_541995],  incapacity,  etc., the site must  document  in the source  
documents  the reason  that the assessment is not completed.  If the subject  cannot  provide a urine  sample for routine  analysis,  the site must  document  in the 
source documents  the reason  that the assessment  is not completed.  Urine  samples  obtained using  a urine  collection bag are acceptable.  Urine -soaked  diapers,  
urine  pads,  etc. are not acceptable  methods  of obtaining  a urine  sample for this study.  The Sponsor  does not advocate use  of a urinary  catheter.  
a Screening evaluation  is to be conducted  for all direct  enrolling  subjects  within  [ADDRESS_707068] study drug dose, and approximately every 3 months until completion 6 months or  
Discontinuation.  The study  site staff will telephone  the subjects  at approximately  1 and 2 months  ± [ADDRESS_707069]’s  legally  authorized

the liquid  taste solutions  described as part of the NIH Toolbox  Regional  Taste  Intensity  Test.  
r Study  drug will be self-administered or with the assistance  of a caregiver,  as applicable.  The dosing is administered  remote  from  the study  site, usually in the 
home setting,  according  to the IFU (see Appendix B ) 
s Quality  of life will be assessed  at all study  site visits  by [CONTACT_541998][INVESTIGATOR_541903]  (Section  11.4). If a subject  cannot  complete  the assessment,  the site 
must  document  this. 
t Use of an electronic diary will be reviewed  with the subject/caregiver  (as applicable)  to determine  their ability/willingness  to use the electronic diary during 
treatment.  
u Adverse events  should be recorded.  At the screening  visit,  this applies  only to rollover  subjects  from  the Phase  2 studies.  For all other  subjects,  adverse  events  
observed/reported  after provision  of informed  consent/assent  are recorded.  Subjects  must  be followed  for AEs for [ADDRESS_707070]  resolved,  whichever  is later.  
v The study  site staff will telephone the subjects  at approximately 1 and 2 months  ± [ADDRESS_707071]’s  health  and seizure  
status,  reinforce  training  on study  drug administration  and diary  documentation,  and to address  concerns.  The investigator  or designee  will conduct  a follow -up 
phone  call with the subject  at 30-[ADDRESS_707072]’s legally authorized representative and oral and/or  
written  assent  will be obtained  from  the subject  as required  by [CONTACT_1201].  
Subjects  who initially  consented  and enrolled  in the study  under  version  1 of the protocol  
dated 31 July 2017 may come in at their next scheduled site visit, reconsent under the 
amended protocol and be dispensed a new container of DBF based upon the revised  
mg/kg  dosing  in Table  4. The subjects  do not need  to come  in for unscheduled  visit.

9.2.1.  Screening  
The Screening  visit (Visit 1) will occur  within  [ADDRESS_707073] completed the Phase 2 studies 160325 (Pediatric) or 160326 (Adult)  
which enrolled subjects with a similar diagnosis may screen for enrollment into this 
Phase [ADDRESS_707074] treatment  period  in 
the Phase 2 study (rollover subjects). These rollover subjects will be assessed for 
enrollment  using  inclusion/exclusion  criteria of this protocol  (42-1703).  In addition to the 
Follow -up clinical laboratory assessments for the Phase 2 studies, clinical laboratory  
screen  for this Phase  3 study  includes  HIV,  HBsAg,  and hepatitis  C in subjects  17 years 
of age and older  (and in subjects  < 17 years  of age at the Investigator’s  discretion).  
The following procedures  will be performed:  
• Obtain written informed consent/assent ( Section  9.1) 
• Record  medical/medication  history  and demographic  information based  on the 
interview  with the potential subject  
• For rollover  subjects  from  the Phase 2 studies described  above,  AEs will be 
documented/assessed  (Section  11.10 ). 
• Obtain vital signs (blood pressure  [BP],  heart rate [HR],  respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR],  
oral temperature). All vital signs will be measured after the subject has been  
resting in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. Blood pressure  
measurements  are to be taken  in the same  arm (if possible)  for the duration  of 
the study.  
If a subject is unable to provide an oral temperature as they are unable to  
retain an oral thermometer  in position  with their  mouth  closed,  a tympanic,  
axillary,  or temporal (forehead)  temperature may be taken.  In this case,  the 
method  should  be recorded  in the source  documents.  
• Obtain  height  and body weight  (without  shoes  and with empty  pockets)  
• Obtain  a 12-lead ECG;  ECG  should  be completed  prior  to any blood  
collection.

• Review  and record  AEs 
9.2.4.  Treatment  Period  (Remote  Study  Drug  Administration) 
The study  drug  Treatment  Period  is for a minimum  of 6 months  after baseline  (Day  1). 
The subjects will administer the study drug as needed with help of their caregiver, if  
applicable,  to treat their recurring  seizures  as they would have  with Diastat® AcuDial™, 
or other prescribed benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The subject or caregiver will document all 
procedures as trained ( Section 9.2.2). Subjects and/or caregivers will perform the 
following:  
• Monitor  and record  seizures,  using  seizure  calendar  in electronic  diary  
• Dose  with study drug  and record use in electronic  diary  
• Complete  diary documentation  as instructed  at the Baseline/Day  1 visit 
(Section  9.2.2 ) 
• Record  any AEs in the electronic  diary  
• Record  any changes  in concomitant  medication  in the electronic  diary  
• Store  study  drug  in a safe place with limited  access  (Section  0) 
• Bring unused  study  drug,  empty  pouches,  and electronic  diary  to all study  site 
visits  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Food and Fluid Intake  
Food and water will be allowed ad libitum at all times, except during the study drug  
application. Per dosing  instructions, the subject should refrain from eating or drinking  
during  study  drug dosing  until full dissolution  of study  drug has been  confirmed  by [CONTACT_542001].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dosing  
Dosing  will occur  away  from  the study  site. The subject  or caregiver  will administer  the 
study  drug  as described  in the IFU.  The actual time of study  drug  film placement will be 
documented  in the study  diary.  
A second  dose,  when required,  may be given  within  [ADDRESS_707086]/caregiver.  No more  than [ADDRESS_707087] containing diazepam  (e.g., Diastat® AcuDial™) except  as instructed  by a 
physician.  
The DBF  dose will be determined  according  to age and weight  category  in a manner  
analogous  to the Diastat® AcuDial™ label [ 11] ( Table  4). The rationale  for the dose 
regimen  of the test product  is provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
The adjustment  of study  drug dose  by [CONTACT_542002].  Where  there is

may also make  adjustments as medically  indicated.  
 
9.2.5.  Treatment  Period  Scheduled Telephone Contact  [CONTACT_542003]  1 and 2 months  ± 7 days after  the 
Baseline  Visit  (Study  Day 1/Visit 2) to query the subject/caregiver  regarding  study  drug  
administration,  diary  use, seizures,  AEs,  changes in concomitant medication,  to reinforce  
training,  and to address concerns.  
If subject  has had qualifying  seizures  for which  study  drug was not taken,  the site should 
determine if the subject  chose  to use a different rescue  (eg, Diastat  ® in lieu of study  drug  
and the reasons why and brought back in for a study visit). The site should discuss with  
the medical  monitor  the appropriateness  of the subject’s  inclusion in the study.  
If the subject  has not had any qualifying  seizures  within  this timeframe,  the site should 
discuss  with the Medical  Monitor  the appropriateness  of the subject’s  inclusion  in the 
study.  
9.2.6.  Final  / Completion  or Early  Withdrawal  Visit  
The 6-month  visit will serve  as the study  Final/Completion  site visit . The Sponsor  has 
elected  to extend  the study beyond  [ADDRESS_707088] Final/Completion Visit  is projected  for September  2020.  
Prior to the subject’s  return  for the 6-month  visit,  site personnel  will review  the subject’s 
status  with respect  to use of study  drug.  If a subject  has experienced  [ADDRESS_707089]’s participation can be  
extended for another [ADDRESS_707090] to end study participation  for non- users  prior  to end of 
study.  
Subjects who prematurely  withdraw  from  the study  for any reason  should  undergo  a Final  
Visit  as well.  If the Early Withdrawal  Visit  is not done,  the reason(s) will be recorded  in

11. SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
Safety  assessments are performed at each study visit/contact,  as specified  in the Schedule  
of Assessments,  Table  6. 
11.1. Vital  Signs  
Vital signs (body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood  
pressure measurements) will be measured,  recorded,  and evaluated  at the visits  indicated  
in the Schedule of Assessments. All vital signs will be measured after the subject has 
been  resting  in a sitting  position  for at least  5 minutes.  Blood  pressure measurements  are 
to be taken  in the same  arm (if possible)  for the duration  of the study.  
Vital sign measurements  will be repeated if clinically  significant or machine/equipment  
errors occur. Out -of-range BP, RR or HR measurements will be repeated at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  Any confirmed,  clinically  significant vital sign measurements  
must  be recorded  as AEs.  
11.2. Body  Height  and Weight  
Body weight  (without  shoes,  and empty  pants  pockets) will be recorded  whenever  vital 
signs  are recorded,  and height  (without shoes)  will be recorded  at all study  site visits,  to 
calculate  weight -based  study  drug dosage.  
11.3. Physical and Neurological  Examinations 
A complete physical examination (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat [HEENT], heart,  
lungs, abdomen, skin, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, neurological, and 
musculoskeletal systems)  will be performed at Screening Visit 1. Physical  examinations  
will be performed by [CONTACT_542004].  In addition,  medical  history will 
be recorded  at screening,  including  smoking  history,  if applicable.  
A symptom -driven physical examination to verify continued subject eligibility and to  
follow up any change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the  
Schedule of Assessments. Symptom -driven limited physical and neurological  
examinations will be performed at First, Early Withdrawal / Completion Visit, and as  
clinically  indicated  at any study  visit.  All changes  not present  at baseline  or described  in 
the past medical history and identified  as clinically  noteworthy must  be recorded  as AEs.  
11.4. Quality  of Life Assessments  
Age-appropriate QoL assessments will be performed at all study site visits (Table 7 ). 
QoL administration  should  be delayed  if a subject  has experienced  a simple  or complex  
seizure within the previous [ADDRESS_707093] moves from one age range to the next while participating in the study,

assessment. The site must document in the source documents the reason that these  
assessments  cannot  be completed  (e.g.,  unable  to perform  test due to incapacity,  etc.).  
11.5. Columbia  Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  
The C-SSRS,  which assesses suicidal  behavior  and ideation,  will be administered  at each  
study visit. Qualified, trained staff will administer the C -SSRS, Baseline -Screening  
version at screening, and the C -SSRS,  Since Last Visit version will be administered at 
Baseline and all subsequent visits. Subjects with Type 4 (active suicidal ideation with  
some  intent  to act, without  specific  plan)  or Type  5 (active  suicidal  ideation  with specific  
plan and intent)  suicidal  ideation  during the study  will be discontinued  from  the study  and 
referred  to a mental  health  professional.  
The C-SSRS assessment  should be completed  according  to the schedule  of assessments  in 
appropriately aged subjects. These assessments may be omitted as applicable if a 
subject's cognitive status does not allow the subject to personally complete the 
assessment. The site must document in the source documents the reason that these  
assessments  cannot  be completed  (e.g.,  unable  to perform  test due to incapacity,  etc.).  
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707095]  will be reviewed with the clinical investigators and other  medically  
qualified study  personnel.  
The examiner will make an illumination -assisted visual inspection of the oral mucosa at  
Screening,  and at all study  site visits.  Mucosal  irritation  and any injuries  to the oral cavity  
(e.g.,  tongue  or mucosa laceration,  broken  tooth,  bleeding)  will be recorded  using  criteria 
specified in a checklist in the eCRF. Any de novo post- dose mucosal irritation or other  
abnormality will be reported as an AE of special interest and will be followed until  
resolution.  
 
11.7. Gustatory Sense  Assessment  
A gustatory  (sense of taste) assessment using  commercially  available  taste  test strips from  
Burghart Messtechnik, in subjects 12 years and older, will be conducted by [CONTACT_542005].  
The general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) will be used as the evaluation scale 
(ranging from “no sensation at all” to “strongest sensation of any kind”) using  
commer cially available taste test strips from Burghart Messtechnik The taste strips are  
statistically well- correlated with the NIH Toolbox Regional Taste Intensity Test  
solutions.[17 ] The test takes approximately  [ADDRESS_707096]'s  cognitive  status  does  not allow  the subject to personally  complete  
the assessment. The site must document in the source documents the reason that thes e 
assessments  cannot  be completed  (e.g.,  unable  to perform  test due to incapacity,  etc.).  
11.8. Electrocardiograms  
A 12-lead resting  ECG  will be obtained  at the visits  indicated  in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 6 ). Whe n pe rformed  on days  of blood  draws,  ECG  should  be 
completed  prior  to blood collection.  
At Screening, the Investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease  
that could  exclude  the subject  from  the study.  An assessment  of normal  or abnormal  will 
be recorded  and if the ECG is considered  abnormal,  the abnormality  will be documented 
on the eCRF. ECGs will be repeated at Baseline and 6 months after dosing, and at the 
Study  Final/Completion or Early  Withdrawal Visit,  and at any study  site visit if clinically  
significant abnormalities  are observed  or artifacts  are present.

Serology: At screening (in subjects 17 years of age and older) tests for HIV, HBsAg, and HCV. Test  
positive for any of these tests is exclusionary. These may be collected in subjects < 17 years of age at the Investigator’s  discretion.  
Pregnancy Tests: Both serum and urine pregnancy tests will be performed in all female subjects of  
childbearing potential; if the subject is  unable to provide a urine sample, the option to use only the serum  
pregnancy test will be  according  to Investigator  judgment.  
Breath Alcohol Test: The Alcohol Breath Test should be completed according to the schedule of  
assessments  in subjects  17 years  of age and older  (and in subjects  < 17 years  of age at the Investigator's  
discretion). If a subject cannot complete the assessment or, if in the judgment of the Investigator, the subject's exposure to alcohol is limited as determined by [CONTACT_198669], incapacity, etc., the site must  document  in the source  documents  the reason  that the assessment  is not completed.  
Urine Tests for Drugs of Abuse: amphetamines, phencyclidine, cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  
tetrahydrocannabinol; if a subject cannot provide a urine sample for drug screen, an accurate and  
thorough review should be conducted by [CONTACT_542006]/or subject’s  
caregiver/study partner/Legally Authorized Representative. This review should include, as applicable, a Physical Exam, Review of Systems/Symptoms (ROS), Past Medical History, Concomitant Medications  
(including last known diazepam use), any new or ongoing adverse events, sexual activity history,  
pregnancy/menstrual  cycle st atus and illicit  drug use. 
Blood and urine  samples will be analyzed at a central  laboratory facility.  Urine  samples  
will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_5230],  and a microscopic  analysis will be performed  if the results  
of dipstick indicate abnormalities to be further investigated.  All laboratory reports  must  
be reviewed,  signed,  and dated by [CONTACT_737].  A legible  copy  of all reports  must be 
filed with both the subject's  eCRF  and medical  record  (source  document)  for that visit.  
Any laboratory  test result considered  by [CONTACT_542007]  42-1703  
Amendment  2 
02 March  2020  Confidential  Page  88 of 132  
  
should be considered an AE (clinically significant AEs include those that require an  
intervention).  Clinically significant abnormal  values  occurring  during  the study  will be 
followed  until  repeat test results  return  to normal,  stabilize,  or are no longer  clinically  
significant.  
If/When a protocol -required urine sample cannot be obtained from the subject (at any  
study  visit),  the Investigator should  in lieu ensure  that an accurate  and thorough  review  
be conducted by [CONTACT_542006]/or subject’s caregiver/study  
partner/Legally Authorized Representative.  This review  should  include,  as applicable,  a 
Physical Exam, Review of Systems/Symptoms (ROS), Past Medical History,  
Concomitant Medications (including last known diazepam use), any new or ongoing  
adverse events,  sexual activity history,  pregnancy/menstrual  cycle  status  and illicit drug  
use. This is extremely  important  during the screening/eligibility  visit as the urine  sample  
is a key component/assessment in determining  a host of inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  
As with other missing/unobtainable protocol -mandated assessments, the site must 
document  the reason why the urine  sample  could not be obtained  from  the subject (e.g., 
subject  is incontinent,  subject is incapable  of supplying  a urine  sample  on request,  etc.) 
in the source  documents  and via the eCRF.  
Urine samples obtained  using  a urine  collection  bag are acceptable.  Urine- soaked  diapers,  
urine  pads,  etc. are not acceptable  methods  of obtaining a urine  sample  for this study.  The 
Sponsor  does  not advocate  use of a urinary catheter.  
11.10. Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during  
the study  or, if present  at screening,  worsens  during  the study,  regardless  of the suspected  
cause of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the 
indication under study) present at screening will be documented in the medical history  
eCRF. Changes in these conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases  should  be noted  on the AE eCRF  during  the rest of the study.  Symptoms  present  
at screening in rollover  subjects  whose  screening  visit is also their  final  visit of the Phase  
2 study  will be recorded as AEs (Table  6). Clinically  sig
 nificant laboratory abnormalities 
should also be recorded  as AEs.  Surgical  procedures  that were planned  before  the subject 
enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study  
inclusion; the medical condition should  be reported in the subject’s  medical  history.  
Additionally,  anticipated  AEs for this study  population,  listed  below,  must be reported  by 
[CONTACT_542008]. Instead  
these AEs will be reviewed in aggregate every three months by [CONTACT_542009]  (DSMB).  This aggregate  review  
may result  in an expedited  safety  report.  
 
11.10.1.  Anticipated  Adverse  Events for this Study and Precautions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  List of Anticipated  Adverse Events for this Study  
The most  frequent  adverse  event  reported  to be related  to Diastat®AcuDial™ in the two 
double-blind, placebo -controlled  studies  was somnolence  (23%).  Less frequent  adverse  
Aquestive Therapeutics

events  were  headache  (≤ 5%),  diarrhea (≤ 4%),  ataxia  (≤ 3%),  dizziness  (≤ 3%),  euphoria  
(≤ 3%), incoordination (≤ 3%), rash (≤ 3%), vasodilatation (≤ 2%), and asthma (≤ 2%).  
The majority  of adverse events  were  mild to moderate  in severity  and transient  in nature.  
Adverse events reported elsewhere were dose related and included fatigue, drowsiness,  
muscle weakness, ataxia, occasional dizziness, dysarthria, slurred speech, headache,  
paradoxical  reactions,  confusion, emotional poverty, decreased  alertness,  depression, and 
increased  or decreased  libido  (Valium®  package insert  2015).  
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_541935] -equivalence bio-a vailability studies, the most frequently  
reported adverse event was somnolence. In Study1899, there were 7 occurrences of  
somnolence  in 7 subjects  while  taking  5 mg study  drug  and there were  10 occurrences  of 
somnolence in 10 subjects while taking 5 mg Diastat®AcuDial™ rectal gel. In Study  
1900,  there  were  12 occurrences of somnolence  in 12 subjects while  taking  20 mg study  
drug and there were 11 occurrences of somnolence in 11 subjects while taking 20 mg 
Diastat®AcuDial™ rectal  gel. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cautionary Statements  
Due to the Central  Nervous  System  (CNS)  depressant  effect of diazepam,  any subject or 
subject taking it should be cautioned not to operate dangerous machinery or motor  
vehicles or engage in activities requiring mental  alertness  until  they have  returned  to their  
baseline level of functioning. Additionally, there is the potential for a synergistic CNS  
depressant effect when diazepam is used simultaneously with alcohol or other CNS  
depressants including ba rbiturates, anxiolytics, sedatives, anti -depressants, hypnotics,  
anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_006], phenothiazines, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti -histamines, narcotic 
analgesics  and anesthetics.  
Although study drug will not be used on a chronic daily basis, as noted in the preceding  
sections, diazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance and can produce drug  
dependence. Caution should be used in any subject with a history, however remote, of 
alcohol or drug abuse  or dependence.  Diazepam  may interact  with disulfiram,  cimetidine,  
ketoconazole, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, diltiazem or omeprazole resulting in increased  
plasma levels of diazepam.  Subjects  who have  taken  diazepam  concomitantly  with these  
medications  or within 5 half-lives  of the respective drug,  should  be observed  closely  for 
evidence of enhanced benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_541936] (e.g., increased or prolonged sedation  
(Valium®  PI). 
 
11.10.2.  Collection  and Documentation  of Adverse Events  
Subjects/caregivers  will be instructed  to report AEs at each study  visit.  All A Es are to be 
followed  until resolution or until  a stable clinical  endpoint  is reached.  Any de novo  post- 
dose  mucosal  irritation  or other  abnormality  will be reported  as an AE of special interest  
and will be followed  until  resolution  (see Section  11.6 ). 
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration,  
frequency,  severity,  relationship to study  drug,  action taken  with study  drug,  treatment  of 
event,  and outcome.  Furthermore,  each AE is to be classified  as being  serious or 
non-serious.  Changes  in AEs and resolution dates  are to be documented  on the eCRF.  
Aquestive Therapeutics  
Diazepam  Buccal  Film  Protocol  Number  42-[ADDRESS_707097]  occurred.  
Specific guidelines  for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_542010]  9 and Table  10. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the  
maximum  intensity  for the event  should  be recorded.  If the intensity  category  changes  
over a number  of days,  then the changes  should be recorded  separately (with  distinct  
onset  dates).  
Table  9: Classification  of Adverse  Events by [CONTACT_542011],  causing  minimal  
discomfort  and not interfering  with everyday activities.  
MODERATE  An event  that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere  with normal  
everyday activities.  
SEVERE  An event  that prevents  normal  everyday activities  
Table  10: Classification  of Adverse  Events by [CONTACT_542012]  A clinical event,  including  laboratory  test abnormality,  with a reasonable 
time sequence to drug administration,  unlikely  to be attributed  to current  
disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically 
reasonable response  on withdrawal.  
Possible  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable  
time sequence to drug administration,  but which  could also be explained  by 
[CONTACT_9153]. Information on drug 
withdrawal may be lacking  or unclear.  
Unlikely  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable  
time sequence to drug administration which makes a c ausal relationship  
improbable,  and which  other  drugs,  chemicals  or underlying disease  provide  
plausible  explanation.  
Unrelated  This category  is applicable  to adverse events  which  are judged  to be clearly  
and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
and do not meet the criteria for drug relationship listed for the above - 
mentioned conditions.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the  
maximum  intensity  for the event  should  be recorded.  If the intensity  category  changes  
over a number  of days,  then the changes  should be recorded  separately (with  distinct  
onset  dates).

11.10.3.  Serious  Adverse Events  and Reporting  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered  “serious” if, in the view  of either  the Investigator  or the Sponsor,  it 
meets  1 or more  of the following  criteria:  
• is fatal 
• is life-threatening  
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69485]  
• results in a persistent or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the 
ability  to conduct  normal  life functions  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Other important  medical events  that may not be immediately  life-threatening  or result  in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered  
serious adverse events  (SAEs)  if they are thought  to jeopardize  the subject  and/or  require  
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining a SAE. Since  
SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems, it is  
important to take into account both the Investigator’s and the Sponsor’s assessment. If  
either  the Sponsor  or the Investigator believes  that an event is serious,  the event must  be 
considered  serious  and evaluated  by [CONTACT_542013].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting  Serious  Adverse Events  
An SAE  occurring  during  the study or [ADDRESS_707098]  be reported  within  24 hours  of occurrence  or when  the Investigator  becomes  
aware of the event. Notification can be made using the dedicated fax line or telephone  
line for the Syneos  Pharmacovigilance Group:  
 
Syneos  Pharmacovigilance  Fax Number:  +[PHONE_1877]  
Syneos  Pharmacovigilance  Telephone  Number:  +[PHONE_11235]  
 
Email  In case of emergency  or fax failure  the report  can also be submitted  by [CONTACT_414581] 
[EMAIL_1606]  
If the Investigator contacts the Syneos Pharmacovigilance Group by [CONTACT_756], then a  
written  report  must  follow  within  [ADDRESS_707099]’s participation  in the study  is to be followed  until it either  resolves,  stabilizes,  
returns to baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be  
attributable to the study  drug  or procedures.  
 
11.10.4.  Pregnancy  
Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast feeding and  
must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening. Following administration of study  
drug,  any known cases  of pregnancy  in female  subjects  will be reported  until  the subjec t 
completes  or withdraws from  the study.  The pregnancy  will be reported  immediately  by 
[CONTACT_80381]/emailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor (or  
designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be  
processed as an SAE; however, the Investigator will follow the subject until completion  
of the pregnancy  and must assess  the outcome  in the shortest  possible  time but not more  
than 30 days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the  
Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up Pregnancy 
Report.  If the outcome  of the pregnancy  meets  the criteria for immediate  classification  of 
an SAE  (e.g.,  spontaneous  or therapeutic abortion [any congenital  anomaly  detected  in an 
aborted fetus  is to be documented],  stillbirth,  neonatal  death,  or congenital  anomaly),  the 
Investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE form to the  
Sponsor  (or designee)  within  [ADDRESS_707100] ose. Caution should be observed in use of flumazenil in epi[INVESTIGATOR_541937].  The complete  flumazenil package insert,  including 
CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS, should be consulted  
prior  to use.

12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All analyses will be descriptive,  and no formal  statistical testing  will be performed.  All 
summaries will be done for all subjects combined, as well as by [CONTACT_551] (pediatric,  
adolescent,  adult).  Pediatric  and adolescent  subjects  might  be combined  as 1 group  for 
summary  purpose.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using the Statistical Analysis Software 
(SAS®) Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and  
summary  tables  will be prov ided.  Summary  statistics  will be presented  by [CONTACT_542014]. For continuous variables, data will be summarized with the number of subjects (n), mean,  standard  deviation  (SD),  median,  min, and max.  For categorical  variables,  data 
will be tabulated  with the number  and proportion of subjects for each category.

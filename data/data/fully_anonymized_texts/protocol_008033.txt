Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 8 of 147 be considered for enrollment into the study.  
Study Duration:  Approximately 90 days per patient f rom screening to Day 29 (D29)  + 2 days 
(however, this could be longer to follow any adverse event [AE] to resolution 
or to establishment of a new baseline).  
Overall Study 
Design:  
 This is a three -part, Phase 1/2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and adaptive safety study of CA -008 in patients 
undergoing VHR.  
In Part  A, CA-008 15 mg will be administered in an open -label exploration of 
different delivery techniques. The objective is to determine the safety, 
feasibi lity, PK and appropriateness of administration of a single dose of 
CA-008 infiltrated/instilled during surgery in patients undergoing VHR. It is 
expected that [ADDRESS_92352] 8 pati ents receive the optimal delivery technique which 
will allow a formal safety assessment of the 15 mg dose of study drug.  
In Part B, if the formal safety assessment from Part A of CA -008 15 mg is 
favorable, then the active  study drug dose  will be increased . The single dose 
selected for Part B  is 24 mg, based on the experience in Part A , delivered as 80 
mL of a 0.3 mg/mL solution. Using the general delivery technique identified in 
Part A, this dose, concentration  and volume will be assessed compared to a 
placebo in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], double -blind, randomized, parallel -group design  (see Figure) . 
The objective of P art B is to determine preliminarily the tolerability of planned 
study drug administration as well as the pain profile of the placebo control 
group. It is expected that approximately 24 patients (up to 32) will be enrolled 
in Part B.  The results of Part B w ill be unblinded for analysis prior to the 
initiation of Part C.  
 
In Part C, the active dose level of CA -008 from Part B will be evaluated 
compared to placebo in a larger randomized, double -blind, parallel -group 
design to evaluate efficacy and safety. It is expected that ~1 00 patients will be 
enrolled in Part C  to bring the total number of patients enrolled in the study to 
up to ~150.  
For each patient, the study will be conducted in two periods:  
• Inpatient period which continues from check -in on D1 until discharge 
(4 days or 96 hours [h] following surgery [T96 ± 4 h], [D5]). Discharge 
may be delayed, if needed, for medical reasons.  
• Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit 
through follow up visits to D29 + 2 days. Note that additional follow up

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 9 of 147 visits may occur at any time or even after D29 to follow AEs to resolution 
or to establish a new baseline.  
During the inpatient period, patients will undergo VHR including study drug 
treatment (CA -008 or placebo) followed by [CONTACT_84762], PK, 
and drug effect, in particular focusing on reported pain and need for analgesia. 
During the outpatient period, patients will have serial assessments of safety and 
drug effect.

Study 
Treatment 
Dosing 
Schedule:  Study treatment is to be administered intraoperatively as a single administration 
via infiltration/instillation into the “surgical site” prior to wound closure.  
In general, the intent is to deliver local anesthetic into the surgical site “on the 
way in” (upon adequate exposure of and prior to incision/dissection of target 
tissues). Converse ly, study drug (active or placebo) delivery to the same and 
other areas will be administered by [CONTACT_84763] (injected) and/or 
instillation/irrigation (dripped) to the surgical site “on the way out” (prior to 
and at the time of surgical closure).  
The “surg ical site” is defined as the area extending approximately at least 
2-3 cm in all directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the margins 
of substantially all tissue traumatized by [CONTACT_84764], i.e., all tissue 
dissected, cut, electroca uterized (bovied), sutured or tacked, including both 
deep and superficial areas. The surgical site will include the full area of surgical 
mesh placement.  
Dose Groups : In Part A, CA-008 15 mg (50 ml of a 0.3 mg/mL solution) will be delivered and 
used to ex plore the optimal  technique of delivery , i.e., location and volumes of 
delivery to the different areas and layers of the surgical procedure . The dose of 
CA-008 delivered in Part A will not exceed 15 mg.  
In Parts B and C, CA -008 at a fixed dose of 24 mg (80  mL of a 0.3 mg/mL 
concentration) or blinded placebo will be delivered using the general technique 
identified in Part A.  
Injection of 
Study 
Treatment:  Note: Intent is to distribute study drug by [CONTACT_84763] (injected) and/or 
instillation/irrigation (dri pped /spread ) into/onto substantially all areas in the 
“surgical site.” “Surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately at 
least 2−3 cm in all directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the 
incision site  and will include all deep and superficial tissue traumatized by [CONTACT_84765], i.e., tissue that has been dissected, cut, electrocauterized 
(bovied), sutured, tacked areas  and surrounding tissues  and includes the full 
area of surgical mesh. The s urgical site includes those areas accessed directly 
via the surgical incision and also via laparoscopic access.  
 
Note: The technique for all tissue infiltration described below should include 
multiple microinjections. The needle may be inserted deeply at first and as the 
needle is withdrawn, the study drug can be injected slowly along the needle

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 11 of 147 track. The intent is to distribute the study drug widely in the surgical site where 
transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid) member 
1 (TRPV1 ) receptor targets are located , to act as a conduction block in intact 
nerves and not in a single, deep depot  injection. Substantially all tissue 
traumatized by [CONTACT_84766].  
 
If laparoscopic assistance is used, study drug will also be delivered to the site of 
the laparoscopic incisions requiring surgical closure.  
The gen eral technique to be used is to allocate the total study drug volume to 
the different tissue layers as follows:  
• Deep midline /peritoneal  layer – approximately up to 25% of the total 
volume  
• Mesh /fascia  layer – at least approximately 50% of the total volume  
• Anterior layer – approximately up to 25% of the total volume  
If laparoscopy is utilized, then a few milliliters of study drug intended for the 
anterior later will be infiltrated into the laparoscopy ports.  
 
Part A:  
The initial total study drug volume admini stered per patient will be 50 mL 
delivered during the surgical procedure in divided aliquots. Modifications to the 
total study drug dose, volume , drug concentration, and allocation for 
subsequent patients may occur based on information from prior patients.  
• Deep midline /peritoneal  layer –10 mL  
• Mesh /fascia  layer –30 mL 
• Anterior layer – 10 mL 
Parts B and C:  
The allocation will be as follows, equating to a total study drug volume of 80 
mL (details follow in the protocol):  
• Deep midline /peritoneal  layer – approximately 10  mL 
• Mesh /fascia  layer –approximately 60  mL 
• Anterior layer – approximately 10  mL (up to 5 mL  of this volume may be 
delivered to the laparoscopy port(s))  
Preoperative, 
Anesthesia and 
Perioperative 
Care:   At check -in (pre -operatively), at least 1 -2 hours before surgery:  
• Celecoxib  200 mg orally (PO)  
• Acetaminophen  [ADDRESS_92355] been administered, no additional non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_84682] (through T96).

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 12 of 147 The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia :  
• Inhaled anesthetic or propofol infusion with or without nitrou s oxide 
(N2O).  
• Adequate optional premedication typi[INVESTIGATOR_84683] (up to 5 mg) , 
fentanyl (up to 100 mcg) , more can be given if indicated  
• Supplemental a nesthesia and sedation will be per institutional guidelines  
• Intra -operative titration of intraveno us (IV) fentanyl, including during 
emergence, will be per institutional guidelines.  
In addition, patients will receive bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84684] (Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84685]) 175 mg 
delivered as follows:   
• Prior to start of surgery under ultrasound guidance:  
o Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84686] l 0.25%, 30  mL (75 mg) diluted with 10 mL of normal 
saline to a volume of 40 mL delivered as a rectus block with 20 mL 
on each side.  
Note: In Part A, the adequacy of the anesthetic regimen is part of the 
assessment of the technique feasibility. If patients report exc essive pain during 
the immediate post -operative period, a TAP block may be added for subsequent 
patients but the total dose of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84687] 175 mg.  
• Immediately before/ after surgical incision:  
o PART A: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84685] 0.25%, 40 mL ( 100 mg), may be di luted in up 
to 110 mL of normal saline to a total volume of not more than 150 
mL: Infiltration of abdominal wall, anterior rectus abdominis 
sheath, posterior rectus abdominis sheath, other fascia, peritoneum 
(including circumferential areas of intended mes h placement )  
o PARTS B and C: Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_84685] 0.25%, 40 mL (100 mg), to  be diluted 
in 40 mL  of normal saline to a total volume of 80 mL:  
Infiltration of abdominal wall, anterior rectus abdominis sheath, 
posterior rectus abdominis sheath, other fascia, peritoneum 
(including circumferential areas of intended mesh placement)  
Standard supplemental anesthetic and perioperative care will be provided per 
institutional guidelines. This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] (but not be limited to) steps 
to ensure preservation of intraoperative normothermia (including the use of 
preoperative and intraoperative forced -air warming) and deep venous 
thrombosis prophylaxis . 
Intraoperative 
Analgesia  and 
Care : Patients will receive general anesthesia and bilateral rectus blocks (see 
Section  9.2.1  Preoperative, Anesthesia and Perioperative Care).  
During surgery, ensure that patients receive the following:

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 13 of 147 • 3–500 mL IV fluid , more can be given if indicated  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV  
Note: Ondan setron should not be given to patients in Part B undergoing 
24 hours of 12 -lead Holter monitoring to assess the effects of study drug on the 
QT interval.  
 
Within 15 minutes prior to the end of surgery, a dminister the following:  
• IV hydromorphone, 0.5 mg  
• Note: IV morphine 2.0 mg can be used if IV hydromorphone is not 
available  
 
Patients who develop clinically significant hemodynamic instability or other 
anesthesia complication prior to study drug administration should not receive 
study drug; in Parts A and B, these patients will be replaced. Replacement 
patients will be assigned the same treatment as the original patient. A 
‘replacement’ randomization list matching that of the main list will be created 
to facilitate this process.  
Rescue 
Medication 
durin g the 
Inpatient 
Period:  Patient s will be encouraged to use rescue medication only for 
moderate -to-severe pain (NRS ≥ 4); however, rescue medication  may be 
requested at any time (i.e., even when NRS < 4) and medication will be 
provided when requested.  Conve rsely, patients may refuse rescue medication 
even when the NRS is ≥ 4. Time intervals for all rescue medication use are 
guidelines that can be modified by [CONTACT_84767].  
• From the time of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU ) discharge through T12:  
o Administer IV hydromorphone 0.5  mg, Q15 minutes PRN  for pain  
of NRS  ≥ 4.  
o Note: IV morphine 2.0 mg can be used if IV hydromorphone is not 
available  
• After T12 –48:  
o Administer PO oxycodone 10 mg , Q 4 hours (h)  PRN  for pain NRS 
≥ 4. 
o Only PO oxycodone may be used as rescue. If a patient  still requires

Amendment 2:  March  15, [ADDRESS_92356], a second dose of rescue medication should not 
be administered.  
Postsurgical 
Care:  After surgery, patient s will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) where patients will be monitored for at least 90 minutes during which 
time pain assessments can begin once the patient  is awake. T0 is the time of 
admission into the PACU  (as recorded in notes by [CONTACT_84768]) . The time 
of extubation will be recorded, if applicable.  
Patient s will use the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) to rep ort their current 
pain intensity multiple times per day during the remainder of the inpatient part 
of the study.  Scheduled times for serial pain assessments are outlined in the 
protocol.  
Rescue medication will always only be administered upon request, i.e., 
independent of the currently reported pain score.  That is, an NRS pain score 
alone does not trigger rescue medication administration.  
If the patient reports pain spontaneously and requests analgesia at an 
unscheduled time (i.e., PRN), a n NRS should be used to record the pain present 
at that time. This unscheduled NRS must be recorded just prior to 
administration of any PRN analgesia, i.e., within [ADDRESS_92357] the recording 
of scheduled NRS scores.  
Medication for moderate to severe pain (NRS ≥ 4) will be administered upon 
request as follows:  
• From T0 to T25  minutes : 
o IV fentanyl 50 mcg , every (Q) 5 minutes for pain NRS ≥ 4 
• From T2 6 minutes to PACU discharge:  
o IV hydromorphone 0.5 mg , Q 10 minutes for pain NRS ≥ 4 
o Note: IV morphine 2.0 mg can be used if IV hydromorphone is not 
available  
After discharge from the PACU, patient s are followed through T96  (± 4 h) as 
inpatient s in the inpatient unit  where s afety and activity/ efficacy evaluations 
will be performed. Patient s will be required to meet standard criteria for 
discharge to outpatient s tatus. Patient s will continue to be monitored as 
outpatient s after discharge from the inpatient unit  through D29 + 2 days for 
various safety and efficacy assessments, and later if necessary , for safety follow 
up.

during the 
Outpatient 
Period:  
 Following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84691] D15 visit, pain will be 
managed with the following regimen only:  
• Scheduled medication:  
o Celecoxib, 100 mg PO twice daily ( BID) (unless contraindicated)  
• Rescue medications (for pain as needed):  
o Acetaminophen, 500-650 mg PO Q 6 h for mild pain (i.e., NRS 
< 4) (unless contraindicated)  
o Oxycodone, 5 mg – 1 or 2 tablets PO Q  4–6 h for moderate -severe 
pain (i.e.,  NRS ≥ 4). Discharge patient with a prescription for 
20 tablets. Use of this rescue medication [time, dose] must be 
recorded in the diary. Pre -rescue medication NRS for opi[INVESTIGATOR_84692].  
Note :  
• Instruct patients to use acetaminophen as the initial option for treating pain 
up to a total daily dose of 4,000 mg.  
Document the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_84693]’s pain continues to be an issue requiring 
additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536].  
Following D15, pain will be managed per institutional guidelines and standards 
of care. Pain medication use will be recorded as a concomitant medication from 
D15 through D29.  
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during the outpatient period may suggest 
the need for an unscheduled in-person visit to assess the surgical site. If such a 
visit occurs, the Investigator should use clinical discretion regarding the 
adequacy of analgesic treatment, capture this occurrence as an AE, and 
document any required treatments

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 25 of 147 Sample Size 
Justification:  In Part A and Part B, no  formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed. 
The sample size of 8-[ADDRESS_92373] been selected empi[INVESTIGATOR_84706] -008 and is considered sufficient for 
exploration of feasibility, tolerability , PK, preliminary efficacy  and safety 
parameters.  
In Part C, a total of ~100  patients will be randomized in 2 parallel arms (1:1) 
with ~[ADDRESS_92374] for the difference in 2 
independent means, a sample size of approximately 40 patients per group 
would provide approximately 80% power to detect a standardiz ed effect size 
(Cohen’s d) of ~0.[ADDRESS_92375] NRS AUC 0-96.  
In Part C, randomization may be stratified based on the size of the ventral 
hernia: for example, <  4 cm vs. ≥ [ADDRESS_92376] size lead to a 
different number of patients per group. The total number of patients to be 
enrolled in the study will not exceed ~150.  
Study 
Populations:  The following 6 analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• Safety Population  consists of all patient s who received any part of a dose of 
study treatment. (Note this must include anyone who terminates early for 
lack of efficacy).  
• PK Population  consists of all patie nts who receive d at least one dose of 
study treatment and have at least one PK sample . 
• PK/QT Population  for cQT analysis consists of all patients with at least one 
time point with both PK and QT data.  
• Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) Population  consists of  all patient s who 
receive d any dose of study treatment  
• Per Protocol (PP) Population  consists of all patients  who receive d a full 
dose of study treatment and have evaluable NRS pain assessments at T12, 
24, 48, 72, and 96 and no two consecutive missing assessments among the other 
time points prior to T96  (± 4 h)/Discharge  
• Study Completers consists of  all patient s who receive d a full dose of study 
treatm ent and complet ed the entire study period through D29 + [ADDRESS_92377] not elected to withdraw from all aspects of study participation  (see 
Section  10.2). Patient s who elect to discontinue participation on or prior to D8 
will be considered to have terminated as of the date of their election ; however ,

healing has occurred (see Section  10.2). 
Statistical 
Considerations:   
 Progression from Part A to Part B will take place after a formal safety 
assessment has been completed showing that the total study drug dose, volume, 
allocation, and technique is acceptably safe and feasible.  The formal safety 
assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor, the CRO 
medical monitor, the relevant Principal Investigator, and an independent 
medical monitor.  
Progression from Part B to Part C will take place after an (“interim”) analysis 
of unmonitored, unblinded data from Part B occurs including data through 
Day 15. This analysis will assess preliminarily the safety and tolerability of the 
active study drug as well as the duration and severity of postsurgical pain in the 
control group.  
In general, descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include n, mea n, 
SD, standard error of mean (SEM), (if appropriate), median, minimum, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be described by [CONTACT_84773].  
All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using 
the Safety Population. A ll safety summaries will be grouped by [CONTACT_84774].  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_84775], 
including TEAEs. AEs leading to discontinuation from the study, AEs related 
to study treatment, and AEs by [CONTACT_84776].  
Actual values and change from baseline in clinical laboratory measures, vital 
signs, and ECGs will also be assessed and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
These data will be summarized using descriptive statisti cs. Abnormal values 
will be determined and flagged in the listings. Laboratory shift tables displaying 
the change (number of patients) relative to the normal range from baseline to 
each study visit will also be presented by [CONTACT_84777]. The 
Investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  
Efficacy, PK, and other assessments will be summarized using appropriate 
descriptive stat istics. A detailed methodology for the statistical analyses of the 
data collected in this study will be documented in an SAP which will be signed 
prior to the database lock.

5.1 Background  
Concentric Analgesics, Inc. (Concentric) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_84712] -008 (vocacapsaicin) to provide 
long-lasting pain  relief of postsurgical pain following a single local administration. CA -008 
is a prodrug of trans -capsaicin (trans -8-methyl -N-vanillyl -6-nonenamide) , the substance in 
chili peppers that produces the sensation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_84713]. Capsaicin is a transient receptor 
potential cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid) member 1 (TRPV1) agonist. TRPV1 is a 
ligand -gated, nonselective, cation ch annel preferentially expressed most densely in C -fiber 
nociceptors and to a lesser extent on Aδ –fiber nociceptors (Babbar 2009 , Caterina 2001 ). 
TRPV1 responds to noxious stimuli including caps aicin, heat, and extracellular acidification, 
and integrates simultaneous exposures to these stimuli (Suresh 2010 , Surh 1995 , Tominaga 
1998 ).  
Capsaicin exposure  to TRPV -1-expressing nociceptor peripheral terminals  results in initial 
excitation of the nociceptor followed by a functional desensitization which continues for 
some time after removal of capsaicin from the site. Capsaicin, however, is virtually insoluble 
in aqueous media  or local anesthetic solutions  which means that capsaicin formulations tend 
to be quite hydrophobic and viscous making them hard to inject and less likely to permeate 
surgical site tissues. Anesiva, which had been developi[INVESTIGATOR_84714], solubilized capsaicin in polyethylene glycol  300 
(Hartrick 2011 ). The product was instilled into the open surgical site and after waiting for 
[ADDRESS_92401] or had clinical development programs for such products. 
Centrexion Therapeutics has an active development program (CTNX -4975) for intraarticular 
injection of capsaicin for chronic osteoarthritis  and Morton’s neuroma (see 
http://centrexion.com/our -pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]/ ). Note that Centrexion is using the Anesiva highly 
viscous polyethylene glycol formulation for its intraarticular knee joint injections.

Amendment 2:  March  15, [ADDRESS_92402]. 
The free base form of CA-008 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_84715] t o yield capsaicin 
and a cyclic urea,  as shown in the scheme below:  
 
 
CA-008 was specifically selected for development due to its short half -life (<  5 min) at 
neutral pH. In Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C, it completely breaks apart to capsaicin and 
CA-101 as the sole degradants.  
The cyclic urea (CA-101) formed has not been previously evaluated for biological activity. 
While not a known compound in the clinical literature, its safety was evaluated in all 
nonclinical studies with CA -008 and it was shown to b e inactive . The toxicokinetic profiles 
for CA -008, CA -101, and capsaicin were determined in Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP ) 
safety studies  and the pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile for various doses have been  determined 
in multiple clinical trials conducted to date . 
In Concentric GLP toxicological Study CA -NC-008-TOX -019-CR, single -dose subcutaneous 
administration of CA -008 HCl was well -tolerated when administered to male and female 
anesthetized dogs at dose levels up to 3.24 mg/kg CA -008 HCl (3.00  mg/kg CA -008 free 
base).  Test article was formulated  in 0.5 mM citrate, 0.4 mg/mL mannitol in saline for 
injection, with a final pH of approximately 3.7 to 3.8.  This study supports clinical doses up to 
100 mg of CA -008 (free base), with concentrations up t o 2.00  mg/mL CA -008 (free base).  
Concentric  Study CA-NC-008-WH-005-MP evaluated  the effect  of CA-[ADDRESS_92403]  repaired  with mesh , in male  and female  Yucatan  minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] . The dose of 
CA-008 HCl administered  to each animal  was 15 mg of CA-008 HCl/animal , which  was 
equivalent  to~0.375  mg/kg.  The Human  Equivalent  Dose  (HED)  was ~ 20 mg/60 kg human  
and the concentration  used in the study  was ~0.87  mg/mL  free base (16 mL). A 9-cm

attached  to the muscle  using 8 simple  interrupted  sutures  of 2-0 Prolene . The hernia

5.3 Previous Human Experience  
There is substantial clinical support for the potential safety of capsaicin, the active molecule 
released by [CONTACT_28474] -008 in vivo . In addition to consumption in hot spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716] (chili peppers), 
capsaicin is an approved product for dermal applications for over-the-counter ( OTC ) and 
prescription use (Qutenza; 8% patch for management of neuropathic pain associated with 
post herpetic neuralgia) , is frequently used intradermally in experimen tal pain models,  and 
has been studied clinically for wound instillation for postsurgical analgesia (Anesiva; Adlea; 
capsaicin for instillation).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_92405]-in-human study (Study CA -PS-2017 -101) evaluated  the safety an d tolerability of 
CA-[ADDRESS_92406] metatarsal osteotomy for 
correction of hallux valgus deformity, more commonly known as a  bunionectomy. This study 
also evaluated PK and preliminary efficacy assessment of CA -008 to inform future studies in 
our clinical development plan.  This study evaluated  5 different doses of CA -008 (0.5 mg, 
1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg  and 4.2 mg ). The safety, efficacy and PK results for the Phase 1 
bunionectomy study are shown in the current Investigator s’ Brochure.   
A Phase 2 bunionectomy study (CA-PS-201) was completed  with 147  patient s enrolled and 
randomized to one of 3 active doses: 0.05 mg/mL (0.7 mg , N = 36), 0.15 mg/mL (2.1  mg, 
N = 36) and 0.3 mg/mL (4.2 mg , N = 37) vs. placebo  (N = 38) in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_92407] dose of 4.2 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo for 
the primary efficacy endpoint of Pain AUC 0-96 (p = 0.005) and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints: Pain AUC 0 to Week 1 ( AUC 0-W1) (p = 0.036); mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 
(reduced by 50%, p < 0.002); and percent of patient s who were opi[INVESTIGATOR_39895] (OF) from 
0-96 hours (26% vs. 5% for placebo; p = 0.039).  
In CA -PS-201, l ow but measurable levels of CA -008 were documented in the systemic 
circulation for a few hours following study drug instillation  with a T max of ~15 min utes. 
CA-008 was safe and well -tolerated at all dose s. There were  no treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAE)  leading to patient discontinuation and no pattern of TEAEs  that suggested a

A Phase 2, single -ascending dose study was completed in patients undergoing total 
abdominoplasty (CA -PS-204). A total of 54 patients received one of three active doses of 
CA-008: 5 mg as 0.05 mg/mL (N  = 9), 10 mg as 0.1 mg/mL (N  = 13), 15 mg as 0.15 mg/mL 
(N = 12) or placebo (N  = 20). All doses of CA -008 were safe and well -tolerated  (Table  4 and 
Table  5). Four SAEs occurred in 4 patients and all were considered unrelated to study drug: 
post-procedural hemorrhage in two patients, spontaneous abortion in one patient , and deep 
venous thrombosis in one patient  (Table  6). No effect on pain relief was detected due to the 
small sample size and low doses of study drug adm inistered.

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 52 of 147 A two-part, Phase 1/2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study has been 
completed  (final report pending)  in subjects undergoing elective primary unilateral TKA  
(CA-PS-208).  
Part A was an exploratory, sequential, dose -escalation phase in which three doses of CA -008 
were evaluated versus placebo for safety, tolerability, and PK. Each cohort in Part A had 
8 subjects randomized 3:[ADDRESS_92421] acebo. Subjects received placebo or CA -008 in 
a 120 mL volume, delivered as 36 mg (0.3  mg/mL), 60 mg (0.5 mg/mL ) and 90  mg 
(0.75 mg/mL ). 
Two dose levels of CA -[ADDRESS_92422] effective 
dose (0.3 mg/mL) in a prior p ositive bunionectomy postsurgical pain study (Study CA -PS-
201). CA -008 was evaluated at doses of 36 mg (delivered as 0.3  mg/mL) and a higher dose 
of 60 mg (delivered as 0.5  mg/mL) compared to placebo in a multicenter randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group design with a 1:1:1 ratio.  
A total of 1 93 subjects (mean age 62.3 years) were enrolled  in the combined Parts A and B of 
the study , with 61 in the combined 36 mg dose group, 62 in the combined 60  mg dose group, 
6 in the 90  mg dose group, and 64 in the combined placebo group.  Results from Part A 
remained blinded until the end of the study  and were therefore included with Part B  for 
efficacy and safety analys es. Subjects who rec eived 90  mg CA -008 in Part A were included 
in the safety analyses only.  
All doses of CA -008 (36  mg, 60  mg, 90  mg) were well tolerated. Overall, of the 193 subjects 
enrolled and randomized, 184 (95.3%) reported 624 TEAEs ( Table  10). Most TEAEs were 
unrelated (96.9%) and all but 7 (3.6%) were mild or moderate in severity. There were no 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -rule pauses during the study to investigate any specific TEAE. No deaths occurred 
during the study or the follow -up period and there were no TEAEs causing early termination 
from the study.  
No meaningful differences were present across treatment groups for the overall summary of 
TEAEs ( Table  10).  
Related TEAEs were uncommon during the study and no pattern was observed across 
treatment groups. AEs probably or possibly related to study drug were reported for 2 subjects  
in the CA -008 36  mg group (mild pyrexia); 2 subjects in the CA -008 60  mg group (mild 
pyrexia and mild calf pain) and 2 subjects in the placebo group (mild incision site drainage 
and mild pruritus). All related AEs resolved , typi[INVESTIGATOR_84717] a few  days aft er surgery.  
The frequency of subjects with the TEAE of pyrexia was greater in all active treatment 
groups (16% to 33%) compared to the placebo group (6%) without a clear dose -response 
(Table  11). All cases in all groups except for one patient that received placebo were 
considered mild in severity. The AE of pyrexia typi[INVESTIGATOR_84718] 12 -48 hours following 
surgery and represented tran sient low -grade fever (~99 -100°F) without any associated 
abnormal clinical signs or symptoms suggesting a safety concern. During the 12 -48 hours 
following surgery, the mean temperature of the groups receiving active drug appeared to be 
about 0.1 -0.2°C high er than the placebo -treated group (Post hoc Figure 14.3.3).

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 53 of 147 The frequency of patients with the TEAE of tachycardia showed an apparent dose -response 
across all groups treated with active drug with the frequency in the 36 mg group (22%) 
comparable to that in  the placebo group (18%), representing a difference of one patient 
(Table  11). Tachycardia occurred in 17 (27.9%) subjects in the 60 mg group and in 3 (5 0.0%) 
subjects in the 90  mg group. All cases in all groups were considered mild in severity. The AE 
of tachycardia typi[INVESTIGATOR_84718] 1 -2 days following surgery, lasted 1 -2 days and resolved 
without intervention. Tachycardia was not associated with any oth er abnormal clinical signs 
or symptoms or other AEs suggesting a safety concern.   
The frequency of patients with the TEAE of drug ineffective was higher in the group that 
received placebo (10%) than in the groups that received 36 or 60 mg of active drug (5 %; 
Table  11).  
Five SAEs occurred during the study ( Table  10); however, none of these events were related 
to study drug. In the CA -008 36 mg group, there was one event each of myocardial infarction 
and knee postoperative haematoma; in the CA -[ADDRESS_92423] had an allergic 
reaction to lisinop ril; and in the placebo group, there was one event each of pulmonary 
embolus and post procedural haematoma.  
There were no meaningful differences across the treatment groups for assessments of wound 
healing of the surgical site or neurosensory evaluations .

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 58 of 147 5.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Exposures in Prior Clinical Studies  
Rich pharmacokinetic data has been collected at defined timepoints following the completion 
of CA -008 instillation or infiltration in  each of the previous studies. Due to the inherent low 
levels of pH-labile prodrug expected systemically and limits of detection, the CA -008 
parameters are less well defined in the studies with lower CA -008 doses . Generally, CA -008 
has a rapid T max (< 0.25 h r) following the end of infusion. The capsaicin and CA -101 T max 
occur between approximately 0.2 to 1.5 hours after the end of administration. In preliminary 
results from CS-PS-208 ( TKA ) clinical study, CA -[ADDRESS_92425] cases. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_84719] -life of 1.64 hours ( Babbar 
et al. , 2009 ). The t 1/2 for capsaicin ranges from approximately 0.5 to  1.5 hours. CA -101 mean 
t1/2 ranges from  approximately 1.5 to 2  hours ( Table  12, Table  13, Table  14).  
CA-PS-201 (BUN) (CA-008 doses between 0.7 and 4.2 mg): When  dose normalized , Cmax 
appeared to be dose proportional based on visual comparison of the box plots for CA -008, 
capsaicin and CA -101. CA -008 AUC 0-t appeared to be dose proportional while CA -101 and 
capsaicin AUC 0-t appeared to be slightly greater than dose proportional. Note a similar trend 
was observed in the bunionectomy  study , CA-PS-2017 -101 ( CA-008 doses between 0.5 and 
4.2 mg  [Table  13, Table  14]).  
CA-PS-203 (TKA)  (CA-008 doses between 5 and 15 mg ): CA -[ADDRESS_92426] greater variability  (Table  13). 
CA-PS-204 (ABD)  (CA-008 doses between 5 to 15 mg): Proportionality of CA -008 was 
difficult to determine due to many time points having values below the limits of quantitation. 
CA-101 Cmax increased proportionally  with dose . AUC 0-t for capsaicin and CA -101 appeared 
to be dose proportional, given the intercohort variability  (Table  13). 
CA-PS-208 (TKA): ( CA-008 doses between 36 and 90 mg): When normalized to dose, CA-008 
exposure at 90 mg was disproportionally high er than 36 and 60 mg. CA-101 and capsaicin 
exposure increased with increasing dose. When normalized to dose, C max and AUC 0-t were 
approximately  consistent at 36 and 90 mg, with the 60 mg mean C max and AUC 0-t to dose ratio s 
less than expected ( Table  14).

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 63 of 147 5.3.3 Estimated Exposures in VHR/Soft Tissue  
In the current study, a dose of 15 and 30 mg CA -008 may be explored initially.  
The projected PK data for a 15 mg  dose (50 mL of 0.3 mg/ml solution ) of CA -008 in patients 
undergoing ventral hernia repair (CA -PS-209) is expected to be similar to the PK profile for a 15 
mg dose of CA -008 in patients undergoing abdominoplasty (CA -PS-204). There are no reasons 
to expect the saf ety profile of a 15 mg dose in these two similar surgeries to be different, and the 
safety profile of the 15 mg dose was indistinguishable from placebo  in CA -PS-204. As such, the 
Sponsor considers a starting dose of 15 mg of CA -008 in CA -PS-209 to be safe and appropriate  
with escalation to up to 30 mg ( 0.3 mg/ml  in 100 mL) .  
Table  15 includes  the 15 mg exposure observed in CA -PS-203 (TKA), the 36 -90 mg exposure in  
observed in CA -PS-208 ( TKA; part A and B, preliminary data), and the 15  mg exposure 
observed in an abdominopla sty study, CA-PS-204 (ABD) . The table also includes exposures 
predicted in CA-PS-209 (VHR)  at [ADDRESS_92428] expo sure at 30 mg, dose proportionality from 15  mg to 30 mg was 
assumed for CA -008 and CA -101. Capsaicin exposures were also independently modeled from 
PS-204 data PK. A  two-compartment model with linear elimination and zero -order absorption 
adequately fit the  observed capsaicin concentrations in women  undergoing abdominoplasty. A 
Monte -Carlo simulation (via R ) was performed for  delivery of  30 mg CA-008 in a total of 1000 
virtual healthy subjects per dose level.  
As shown in Table  15, a dose of 15 mg  is expected to produce exposures to CA -008, CA -101 
and capsaicin that are less than exposures from the 60 mg dose in CA -PS-208 (TKA), a dose 
shown to be safe. A dose of 30 mg  is expected to produce exposures to  CA-008, CA-101 and 
capsaicin that are less t han exposures from the 90 mg  dose in CA-PS-208 (TKA ), a dose shown 
preliminarily to be safe . The 30 mg dose will not be administered unless the safety assessment of 
the 15 mg dose is supportive.

101 are expected to be equal to or exceed twice that  predicted in CA -PS-209 at 15 and 30

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 68 of 147 5.4 Study  Rationale  
CA-008 is bei ng investigated as a potential therapy for treatment of pain following surgery. 
Ventral hernia repair (VHR) is a standard surgical model for the assessment of postsurgical 
pain.  
5.5 Dose  Rationale  
5.5.1 Selection of Doses  
The preliminary safety of CA -008 was established in relevant animal models and supported 
by [CONTACT_84782] (CA-PS-2017 -101 and CA -PS-201) with doses up to 
4.2 mg (concentration 0.3 mg/mL) and clinical  studies after TKA  (CA-PS-203, CA -PS-208) 
and total abdominoplasty (CA -PS-204) with doses up to 90 mg (concentration 0. 75 mg/mL)  
(Section  5.3), as well as knowledge from prior human studies with an injectable formulation 
of capsaicin. Taken together, t he characterization of the pharmacology, PK, and toxicology 
profiles and the anticipated benefits as well as the potential risks are considered appropriate  
to support the intended initial dose in Part A of 15 mg CA-008 (concentration of 0.3 mg/mL ), 
and if well-tolerated, potentially followed in Parts B and C by a higher, fixed dose of 
between 15 -30 mg (concentration of 0.3  mg/mL)  in this study of acute postsurgical pain 
following  VHR . The selection of the dose for Parts B and C will be based on the experience 
in Part A.  
To predict exposure at 30 mg, dose proportionality from 15 mg to 30 mg was assumed for 
CA-008 and CA -101. Capsaicin exposures were also independently modeled from CA -PS-
204 (ABD) PK data. A two -compartment model with linear elimination and zero -order 
absorption adequately fit the observed capsaicin concentrations in women undergoing 
abdominoplasty. Monte -Carlo simulations (via R) were performed for delivery of 30  mg 
CA-008 in a total of 1000 virtual healthy subjects per dose level ( Section 5.3.2 ). The 
predicted exposures in this study following administration of 30 mg or less are ex pected to be 
within a range that has been shown to be acceptably safe in preclinical and prior clinical 
studies.  
5.5.2 Selection and Timing of Dose  
CA-008 is a pH labile prodrug of capsaicin that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_84724]. Decision for single administration at the time of surgery is based 
on capsaicin’s mechanism of action. Capsaicin exposure results in initial excita tion followed 
by a functional desensitization of TRPV -1-expressing nociceptors which continues for some 
time after removal capsaicin from the site. Administration while the patient  is under 
anesthesia for the procedure supplemented by a regional local anes thetic block or local 
anesthetic infiltration of the surgical site should sufficiently address  any transient pain that 
results from TRPV1 agonism. Administration of CA -008 during the wound closure process is 
ideal for delivering therapy to the surgical sit e, thus optimizing target engagement. Study 
treatment is to be administered intraoperatively as a single administration via 
infiltration/instillation into the “surgical site” prior to wound closure. During closure, the

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 72 of 147 7 INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a three -part, Phase 1/2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled , adaptive safety, 
PK and preliminary efficacy study of CA -008 in patients undergoing VHR .  
In Part  A, CA-008 15 mg will be administered in an open -label exploration of different 
delivery techniques . The  objective of Part A is to determine the safety, feasibility, PK, and 
appropriateness of administration of a single dose of CA-008 infiltrated/instilled during 
surgery in patients undergoing VHR.  It is expected that [ADDRESS_92434] 8 patients receive the optimal delivery 
technique which will allow a formal safety assessment of the 15 mg d ose of study drug . 
In Part B, if the formal safety  assessment from Part A of CA-008 15 mg is favorable, then the 
active study drug dose will be increased to a fixed dose of 24  mg. Using the general delivery 
technique identified in Part  A, this dose, concentration, and volume will be assessed 
compared to a placebo in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], double -blind, randomized, parallel -group design. The 
objective of Part B is to determine preliminarily the to lerability of planned study drug 
administration as well as the pain profile of the placebo control group. It is expected that 
approximately 24 patients (up to 32)  patients will be enrolled in Part B  (see Figure  1). The 
results of Part B will be unblinded for analysis prior to the initiation of Part C.  
Figure  1 Study Design  
 
 
In Part C, the active dose level of CA-008 from Part B  will be evaluated compared to placebo 
in a larger randomized, double -blind, parallel -group design to evaluate efficacy and safety. It 
is expected that ~100 patients will be enrolled in Part C to bring the total number of patients 
enrolled in the study to up to ~150.  
In Parts A, B and C f or each patient, the study will be conducted in two periods:  
• Inpatient period which continues from check -in on Day 1 (D1) until discharge 
(4 days or 96 hours [h] following surgery [T96 ± 4 h], [D5]). Discharge may be 
delayed, if needed, for medical reasons.  
• Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through 
follow up visits to D29 + 2 days. Note that additional follow u p visits may occur 
at any time or even after D29 to follow AEs to resolution or to establish a new 
baseline.

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
 
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 73 of 147 During the inpatient period, patients will undergo VHR including study drug treatment 
(CA-008 or placebo) followed by [CONTACT_84783],  PK, and drug effect, in 
particular focusing on reported pain and need for analgesia. During the outpatient period, 
patients will have serial assessments of safety and drug effect.  
7.2 Duration of Participation  
Approximately 90 days per patient from screening  to Day 29 (D29) + 2 days (however, this 
could be longer to follow any AE to resolution or to establishment of a new baseline).  
7.3 Dose Escalation  and Cohort Expansion  
In Part A, i t is expected that 8 -12 patients will be enroll ed but it may be up to 16 patien ts. 
CA-008 will be administered at a dose of 15  mg (delivered as a 50  mL solution at a 
concentration of 0.3  mg/mL) in an open -label exploration of different delivery techniques.  
In Part B, the active study drug dose will be increased to a fixed dose of 24  mg and tested vs 
placebo in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731].  It is expected that approximately 24 patients (up to 32) will be 
enrolled in Part B. The results of Part B will be unblinded for analysis prior to the initiation 
of Part C.  
In general, dose escalation in Part B will be permitted if there have been no adverse effects 
on wound healing and no intolerable systemic side effects  during Part A . Dose escalation, or 
cohort expansion decisions will be made by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor, the CRO’s 
medical monit or, a relevant Principal Investigator (PI)  and an independent medical monitor . 
This will be based on review of at least the following safety data:  
• Inpatient (i .e., through 96  h) safety and tolerability data from all 8–12 initial patients , 
including vital s igns, physical examination  (PE), neurosensory examination, surgery 
site assessment, laboratory assessments, and AEs; 
• D8 ambulatory visit safety and tolerability data from at least 4 of the initial 8  patients  
in the current  cohort, including vital signs, PE, neurosensory examination, surgery 
site assessment, and AEs. 
 
In Part C, the active dose level of CA-008 from Part B will be evaluated compared to placebo 
in a larger randomized, double -blind, parallel -group design to evaluate efficacy and safety. It 
is expected that ~100 patients will be enrolled in Part C to bring the total number of patients 
enrolled in the study to up to ~150.

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 82 of 147 9.2.3 Inpatient Rescue Medications  
Patients will be encouraged to use rescue medication only for moderate -to-severe pain 
(numeric rating scale [NRS ] ≥ 4); however, rescue medication may be requested at any time 
(i.e., even when NRS < 4) and medication will b e provided when requested. Conversely, 
patients may refuse rescue medication even when the NRS is ≥ 4.  Time intervals for all 
rescue medication use are guidelines that can be modified by [CONTACT_84767].  
From the time of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU ) discharge through T 12:  
◦ Administer IV hydromorphone 0.5  mg, Q15 minutes as needed ( PRN ) for pain 
NRS  ≥ 4. 
◦ Note: IV morphine 2.0 mg can be used if IV hydromorphone is not available  
After T12–48:  
◦ Administer PO oxycodone 10 mg , Q 4 h PRN pain NRS ≥ 4. 
◦ Only PO oxycodone may be used as rescue. If a patient still requires IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_84733] T 12, then the patient will revert to IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_84734]. These patients will still also be follow ed for NRS, 
safety, and all other assessments.  
After  T48–96: 
◦ Administer PO oxycodone 5 mg, Q 4 h PRN pain NRS 5 –10. 
◦ Only PO oxycodone may be used as rescue. If a patient still requires IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_84733] T 12, then the patient will revert to IV analgesia management per 
institutional guidelines. These patients will still be followed for NRS, safety, and 
all other assessments . 
 
NRS scores recorded for PRN pain medication will not replace the recording of schedul ed 
NRS scores. However, if PRN rescue medication has recently been administered and 
persistent pain is reported in a scheduled NRS record prior to rescue medication taking 
effect, a second dose of rescue medication should not be administered.

patients will be monitored for at least 90 minutes during which time pain assessments can 
begin once the patient is awake. T0 is the time of admissi on into the PACU (as recorded in 
notes by [CONTACT_84768]).  The time of extubation will be recorded , if applicable . 
Patients will use the 0 to 10 numerical rating scale (NRS) to report their current pain intensity 
multiple times per day during the remainder  of the inpatient part of the study. Scheduled 
times for serial pain assessments are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1). 
Rescue medicatio n will always only be administered upon request i.e., independent of the 
currently reported pain score.  That is, an NRS pain score alone does not trigger rescue 
medication administration.

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
 
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 83 of 147 If the patient reports pain spontaneously and requests analgesia at an unscheduled time 
(i.e., PRN), an NRS should be used to record the pain present at that time. This unscheduled 
NRS must be recorded just prior to administration of any PRN analgesia, i.e., within 
[ADDRESS_92446] the recording 
of scheduled NRS scores.  
Medication for moderate to severe pain (NRS ≥ 4) will be administered upon request as 
follows:  
From T0 to T25 minutes:  
◦ IV fentanyl 50 mcg, every ( Q) 5 minutes for pain NRS ≥ 4  
From T26 minutes to PACU discharge:  
◦ IV hydromorphone 0.5 mg, Q 10 minutes for pain NRS ≥ 4  
◦ Note: IV morphine 2.0 mg can be used if IV hydromorphone is not available  
 
After dis charge from the PACU, patients are followed through T96 (± 4 h) as inpatients in 
the inpatient unit where safety and activity/efficacy evaluations will be performed. Patients 
will be required to meet standard criteria for discharge to outpatient status. Pa tients will 
continue to be monitored as outpatients after discharge from the inpatient unit through 
D29 + 2 days for various safety and efficacy assessments, and later if necessary, for safety 
follow up.  
9.2.5 Outpatient Analgesic Medications  
Following discharge  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84691] D15 visit, pain will be managed with the 
following regimen only:  
Scheduled medication:  
◦ Celecoxib, 100 mg PO BID (unless contraindicated)  
Rescue medications (for pain as needed):  
◦ Acetaminophen , 650 mg PO Q 6 h for mild pain ( i.e., NRS  < 4) (unless 
contraindicated)  
◦ Oxycodone, 5 mg – 1 or 2 tablets PO Q  4–6 h for moderate -severe pain 
(i.e., NRS  ≥ 4). Discharge patient with 20  tablets. Use of this rescue medication 
[time, dose] must be recorded in the diary. Pre -rescue medication NRS for opi[INVESTIGATOR_84735].  
Note:  
Instruct patients to use acetaminophen as the initial option for treating pain up to a total daily 
dose of 4,000 mg.

Following D15, pain will be managed per institutional guidelines and standards of care. Pain 
medication use will be recorded as a c oncomitant medication from D15 through D29.  
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during the outpatient period may suggest the need for an 
unscheduled in -person visit to assess the surgical site. If such a visit occurs, the Investigator 
should use clinical  discretion regarding  the adequacy of analgesic treatment, capture this 
occurrence as an AE, and document any required treatments.  
9.3 Method  of Assigning Patient s to Treatment Groups  
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment o f patient s to blinded  treatment s, 
to increase the likelihoo d that known and unknown patient  attributes (e.g., demographics, 
baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the 
validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  
Patient s who have provided written  informed consent will be assigned a unique number in 
the screening process. This number will be used to identify the  patient  throughout the study.  
Patient s in Part s B and C  will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1, active to placebo , in a blocked 
randomization of [ADDRESS_92447] and/or monitoring of this study will not be awar e of patients’  treatment group 
assignments. Note that the placebo is identical in appearance to CA-[ADDRESS_92448] completed t reatment. In case of emergency, and only if the 
information is required by [CONTACT_84788] ’s safety in managing a medical 
condition, the treatment may be unblinded at the site by [CONTACT_2329] a code break module. The code 
break module will be p rovided by [CONTACT_16015]. If possible, the Investigator  
should contact [CONTACT_84789]. 
Whenever a treatment assignment  is prematurely unblinded, the reason, date and time of the 
unblinding, a nd the individual who broke the blind must be documented.

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
 
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 85 of 147 It is assumed that the need to unblind a study patient ’s treatment assignment will occur in the 
setting of a SAE, and therefore, all procedures for the reporting of a SAE must be followed . 
9.5 Prior  and Concomitant Therapy  
All non -study medications, including prescription, OTC , or herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], used by [CONTACT_84790] 30 days prior to screening  (prior medications) , during 
screening , and throughout the study  (concomitan t medications) . The Investigator  will 
determine if the prior/concomitant medication(s) affect the patient ’s eligibility to participate 
or continue to participate in the study.  
The use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_84738] -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], ramelteon, zaleplon , 
and zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]) are permitted to treat insomnia during the post-operative  period.  
Within the [ADDRESS_92449]-operative  surgical site infections. At 
the Investigator ’s discretion, agents intended for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis 
after the surgery are allowed.  
On a case -by-case basis, the Invest igator  is permitted to allow the use of some concomitant 
medications, for example to treat an AE, if the Investigator  determines that the medication 
will not affect the patient ’s safety or study integrity. Wherever possible, the Investigator  
should obtain approval from the medical monitor prior to administering the medication.

10.1.3  Surgery  Phase : Administration of Study Medication into the Surgical Site  
Study treatment is to be administered intraoperatively as a single administration via 
infiltration/instillation into the “surgical site” prior to wound closure.  
In general, the intent is to deliver local anesthetic into the surgical site “on the way in” (upon 
adequate exposure of and prior to incision/dissection of target tissues). Conversely, study 
drug (active or placebo) delivery to the same and other areas will be administered by 
[CONTACT_84763] (injected) and/or instillation/irrigation (dripped) to the surgical site “on the way 
out” (prior to and at the time of surgical closure).

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 90 of 147 The “surgical site” is defined as the area extending approximately at least 2 –3 cm in all 
directions (lateral/medial/proximal/distal/deep) from the margins of substantially all tissue 
traumatized by [CONTACT_84793], i .e., all tissue dissected, cut, electrocauterized 
(bovied), sutured or tacked, including both deep and superficial areas. The surgical site will 
include the full area of surgical mesh placement.  
If laparoscopic assistance is used, study dru g may also be delivered to the site of the 
laparoscopic incisions requiring surgical closure.  
Note: The technique for all tissue infiltration described below should include multiple 
microinjections. The needle may be inserted deeply at first and as the nee dle is withdrawn, 
the study drug can be injected slowly along the needle track. The objective  is to distribute the 
study drug widely in the surgical site where TRPV1 receptor targets are located and not in a 
single, deep depot injection to act as a conduct ion block in intact nerves. The intent is that  all 
tissue traumatized by [CONTACT_84766].  
Note: If after the surgery is underway, it becomes evident that the surgical mesh must be 
placed intra -peritoneally (i .e., IPOM  technique), then the patient will not receive study drug. 
In Parts B and C, this patient would be considered randomized but not treated.  
The total study drug volume administered per patient will be [ADDRESS_92452] ug will be delivered to (a) the  midline  deep, peritoneum  layer which includes the 
closure of the peritoneal sac, (b) the m esh lay er which includes both the dorsal and ventral 
aspects of the space created by [CONTACT_84794], 
whether this space is anterior or posterior to the posterior rectus fascia and (c) the anterior 
fascia layer which includes the closure of the  anterior rectus fascia and linea alba. In 
addition, a small amount of study drug will be delivered to laparoscopic portals requiring 
suture closure.  
The initial allocation and general approach to dosing will be  as follows, though minor 
modifications are p ermissible based on surgeon judgment and experience with earlier 
patients in the trial :  
Deep midline /peritoneal  layer – up to approximately 25% of the total volume :  
Infiltrate  or instill  10 mL (Part A) or approximately 10  mL (Parts B and C) , approximatel y 
half the volume  per side, into the deep midline area where closure of the peritoneal sac has 
been completed , along with the posterior rectus sheath if not separated from (peeled off) the 
peritoneum . Use multiple, micro -injections to distribute stud y drug widely  along the closure . 
Ensure that all dissected, resected and sutured areas of the peritoneum (and posterior rectus 
sheath ) are exposed to study drug.

Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-209  Confidential  
 
Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 91 of 147 Note: Laparoscopic visualization can be used to  ensure that induration of the peritoneum 
confirms targeted delivery of study drug.  
Mesh /fascia  layer – at least approximately 50% of the total volume :  
The mesh layer includes  the space created by [CONTACT_84795]. 
It can be i n-between the peritoneum and the posterior rectus fascia or in -between the 
posterior rectus fascia and the rectus abdominis muscle. In either case, the intent is to deliver 
sufficient study drug to both the posterior  (dorsal ) and anterior  (ventral ) aspects  of the space 
created for the mesh, including all tissues that will be in contact [CONTACT_84796].  
The following is a gener al description of the delivery of study drug to the mesh/fascia la yer 
and is a guide for the surgeon. The actual delivery technique may vary based on the 
individual patient anatomy encountered by [CONTACT_11065].  
Part A:  
Using micro -injections, infiltrate  ~10 mL  (Part A) into the posterior surface of the mesh layer 
space whe re the mesh will be placed on both sides of the midline peritoneal closure.  Ensure 
that any areas w here mesh fixation with sutures  or tacks are to be placed are exposed to study 
drug.  
Instill (drip/irrigate) ~5 mL (Part A) onto the posterior surface of the mesh layer space where 
the mesh will be placed. Instill about half the volume ( ~2.5 mL)  at first using a finger to 
spread it around to the entire area followed 2 –3 minutes later by [CONTACT_84797] 
(~2.5 mL). 
Using mic ro-injections, infiltrate ~7.5 mL (Part A) into the circumferential perimeter, i .e., 
edges, of the mesh space , e.g., where the peritoneum and posterior rectus fascia remain 
attached.  
An additional ~7.5 mL (Part A) should be delivered to the anterior surfac e of the mesh layer 
space where the mesh will be placed on both sides of the intended midline closure.  If the 
mesh space is in -between the peritoneum and posterior rectus fascia, then this volume should 
be delivered to the posterior rectus fascia by [CONTACT_84798] -injections. If the mesh space is in -
between the rectus abdominis muscle and the posterior rectus fascia, then this volume should 
be delivered by [CONTACT_84799] a finger to spread it around to the entire area.  Instill about 
half th is volume at first usi ng a finger to spread it around to the entire area followed 
2-3 minutes later by [CONTACT_84800]. 
Part B:  
Using micro -injections, and instillation (drip/irrigation) wherever appropriate and feasible to 
ensure maximum exposure, infiltrate ~30 mL into eac h side of the mesh/fascia layer. 
Depending on the placement of the mesh, this should include (a) the posterior surface of the 
mesh layer (preperitoneal/fascia layer), (b) the circumferential perimeter of the mesh space , 
i.e., edges of the mesh space, e.g., where the peritoneum and posterior rectus fascia remain

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 92 of 147 attached , (c) any areas of mesh fixation with sutures or tacks  and (d) the anterior surface of 
the mesh layer space  (retromuscular/fascia layer).  
Anterior layer – up to approximately 25% of the total volume : 
Infiltrate 10 mL (Part A) or approximately 10  mL (Parts B and C) into the primary closure of 
the anterior rectus sheath and linea alba, divide equally on each side.  
Laparoscopy ports – Up to 5 mL: 
If a laparoscopy p ort(s) will require a suture closure, then infiltrate ~2 –5 mL from the 
anterior layer allocation into the deeper tissues of the port (1-2 mL per port) prior to closure  
using study drug from the volume allocated to the anterior layer .  
Minor modifications t o study drug dosing will be described in the study Pharmacy Manual 
and patient -specific dosing memos but the general approach will not change substantively.  
10.1.4  Postsurgery : T0 ( Admission into the PACU ) to T96 (Discharge)  
Following surgery, patients will be t ransferred to the PACU where they will undergo an 
assessment of safety and efficacy over the next 90 minutes . After discharge from the PACU, 
patients are followed through T96 (± 4 h) as inpatients in the inpatient unit where safety and 
activity/efficacy ev aluations will be performed. T0 is the time of admission into the PACU 
(as recorded in notes by [CONTACT_84768]).  
The schedule of assessments is as follows :  
If the patient reports pain spontaneously and requests analgesia at an unscheduled 
time (i.e., PRN), an NRS should be used to record the pain present at that time. This 
unscheduled NRS must be recorded just prior to administration of any PRN analgesia, 
i.e., within [ADDRESS_92453] the recording of scheduled NRS scores.  
Medication for moderate to severe pain (NRS ≥ 4) will be administered upon request 
as follows:  
◦ From T0 to T25 minutes:  
▪ IV fentan yl 50 mcg, Q 5 minutes for pain NRS ≥ 4  
◦ From  T26 minutes to PACU discharge:  
▪ IV hydromorphone  0.5 mg, Q 10 minutes for pain NRS ≥ 4  
▪ Note : IV morphine 2.0 mg can be used if IV hydromorphone is not 
available  
Pain intensity  (assessed with NRS):   
◦ During  the inp atient stay, NRS at rest beginning with the PACU admission (T0) 
may be assessed once the patient  is awake. Obtain NRS scores at T0 plus 1  hour 
(T1), T0 plus 2  hours  (T2), T4, T6, T8, T12, T16, T20, T24, and every 4  hours

Time windows: ±  5 min utes for T1 and T2; ± [ADDRESS_92454]  be recorded, i.e., not the 
nominal time.  
◦ During  the inpatient stay, as soon as feasible, obtain evoked NRS twice daily after 
3 maneuvers: (a)  coughing 3 times, and (b) sitting up fro m the supi[INVESTIGATOR_84697] 
a standardized position (both legs dangling on the side of the bed), and 
(c) ambulation for approximately 10  yards (30 feet).  Obtain these NRS scores in 
the morning at 10:00  AM (± 1 h) and in the afternoon at 4:00  PM (±  1 h). 
◦ During the inpatient stay, pain scores may be skipped between the hours of 
midnight and 6 :[ADDRESS_92455] be awakened  at these times.  
Vital signs  - HR, BP, RR (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), SpO 2 and temperature (oral) - are assessed 
together postsurgery at T1, T2, T6, T12, and T24, and every 12 hours thereafter until 
T96. Assessments between the hours of 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM may be skipped if 
the patient is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; however, two consecutive assessments may not be skipped. 
The allowable window is ±  [ADDRESS_92456] 4 hours postsurgery, an d 
± 15 minutes for all other times.  
Targeted  PE: T96 (± 4 h ) and prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.  
12-lead ECG: T24 (± 2 h).  
Surgical  site assessment: T96 (± 4 h)  prior to discharge from the inpatient unit  
(Section  17.10 , Appendix J ). If the Investigator determines there are skin reactions 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84699], e.g., more than expected  erythema, drainage, bruising 
or hematoma, induration, swelling, or other skin changes, they should be documented 
as AEs, graded for severity, and followed regularly until resolution or establishment 
of a new baseline  (Section  17.11 , Appendix  K). A digital photograph  of the wound 
site should be taken  if the patient has consented . 
Neurosensory testing  of the surgical area near the incision will be performed at 
T96 (± 4 h) prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.  
◦ Numbness at or near the incision need not be considered a neurologic AE since 
this could occur because of tissue trauma and inflammation fr om the surgery.  
◦ Sensory deficits  or clinically significant persistent sensory change beyond the 
area proximal/distal to the incision at time of discharge, such as allodynia or 
hyperalgesia, must be designated as a neurologic AE. Patients will be followed 
until there is a return to baseli ne or establishment of a new baseline.  
Clinical  laboratory tests T48 (± 4 h ):  
◦ Hematology /Coagulation : hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count with 
differential, RBC  count, platelet count, aPTT, and PT or INR .

The following demographic  data will be recorded: age (birthdate), sex, race, and ethnicity.  
10.3.3  Medical  and Surgical History  
The complete medical and surgical history will include histories of acute,  chronic, or 
infectious disease; surgical or oncologic histories; and any reported conditions affecting 
major body systems. All findings on medical history will be evaluated by [CONTACT_84801] . 
10.3.4  Medication  History  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription, herbal medications/natural health 
products, or investigational drugs) taken by [CONTACT_102] s during the [ADDRESS_92464] be using and willing to continue using 
medically acceptable contraception during the study. Examples of medically acceptable 
forms of contraception include true abstinence, hormonal contr aceptives (combined oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], 
patch or vaginal ring, intrauterine device or system, progestin implant or injection), bilateral 
tubal ligation, or double -barrier methods (i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a 
contraceptive sponge).  
Female patients of non -childbearing potential are not required to use contraception or 
undergo pregnancy tests; however, they must be surgically sterile ( e.g., hysterectomy and/or 
bilateral oophorectomy or salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy, as determined by [CONTACT_84802] h istory) 
or congenitally sterile  or must be post -menopausal. Post -menopausal is defined as being 
amenorrheic for at least one year without another cause  with a n FSH >  40 mIU/mL (or FSH 
above the relevant laboratory value for post -menopausal status) confirmed during screening . 
Male patient s, unless in a relationship with a female partner who is of non -childbearing 
potential (see above), must either be sterile (surgically or biolog ically) or commit to using 
double -barrier methods ( i.e., male condom in addition to a diaphragm or a contraceptive 
sponge) during study  participation .

The clinical laboratory tests will be completed per the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1). In 
addition to the clinical laboratory tests, a serum pregnancy test (β-hCG)  will be performed at 
the Screening Visit and a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to surgery  for female s 
of childbearing potential .  
ALT or AST > 3  × upper limit of normal ( ULN ), Tot. Bili > 2  × ULN , and  ALK > 2 × ULN

Amendment 2:  March  15, [ADDRESS_92472] may be repeated at the discretion of the 
Investigator . 
In the case of a urine drug screen at scree ning that is positive for THC, if the patient is 
willing to abstain from use or consumption of THC -containing products from 7 days prior to 
surgery until the Day 15 visit, they may be allowed to participate in the study. In this case, a 
urine drug screen p ositive for THC at check -in will not exclude the patient.  
If other positive urine drug screen results can be explained by a current prescription or 
acceptable OTC  medication (that does not  otherwise exclude the patient as determined by [CONTACT_3786] ), then the patient may continue to participate in the study . 
10.3.14  Vital  Signs  
Vital signs (supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will consist of  HR, BP, RR , SpO 2 and temperature  (oral)  following a rest 
period. Vital signs will be assessed per the Schedule Assessments  (Table  1). One missed 
assessment between 12:00 AM and 6:00 AM will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Two missed assessments of vital signs in a row is a protocol deviation.  The allowable 
window i s ± [ADDRESS_92473] 4 hours postsurgery, and ± 15 minutes for all other times.  
10.3.15  Electrocardiogram   
[IP_ADDRESS]  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
All 12-lead EC Gs will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments (Table  1) after the 
patient  has been resting in a recumbent/supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes.  The ECG 
variables will include ventricular heart rate  and the PR, QRS, QT , and QTcF intervals. ECGs 
will be signed and dated by a medically qualified  individual to confirm review of the ECG 
and verify whether any abnormalities are clinically significant. In general, abnormal, 
clinically significant ECGs are expected to be associated with an item recorded in medical 
history (e.g., at Screening) or with an AE (if it occurred post study treatment). Note that for 
QTcF, clinically significant prolongation of  QTcF should be > 450 ms for male patient s and 
> 470 ms for female patient s or an increase of QTcF of 30  ms or greater  (compared to the pre 
surgical ECG) , as well as any other changes deemed by [CONTACT_84803] . 
Clinically significant changes in ECG  will be considered an AE.

Amendment 2:  March  15, [ADDRESS_92475], genit al or rectal examination ) will 
be performed at Screening. A focused interim or targeted PE will be performed pre -surgery 
and after surgery during the inpatient and outpatient periods (see Table  1).  
Body weight (kg ), in indoor clothing, but without shoes , will be measured at Scre ening  and at 
T96. Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured, and  body mass index  (BMI ) will be 
calculated at Screening only.  BMI shall be calculated as kg/m2. The site should use the 
National Institute of Health  (NIH) website BMI calculator (available at: 
http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi -m.htm ). 
10.3.17  Surgical  Site Assessment   
The s urgical  site should be assess ed per the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) to determine 
if any site related AEs have occurred . The Investigator  will evaluate their satisfaction with 
the healing of the wound during this  Surgical Site assessment using an 11 -point scale (0 10) 
where a score of 0 is “Completely unsatisfied,” and a score of 10 is “Completely satisfied”  
(Section  17.10 , Appendix  J). Assessments will also be performed at each of the follow -up 
visits or at the time of early discontinuation.  Insufficient wound healing that is clinically 
significant should be recorded as an AE. A follow -up visit will be scheduled after the D29 
visit if the Investigator  observes insufficient wound or bone healing  or to ensure resolution of 
an ongoing AE .  
If there are skin reactions atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84699], e.g., more than expected erythema, 
drainage, bruising or hematoma, induration, swelling , or other  skin changes, they should be 
documented as AEs, graded for severity , and followed regularly until r esolution or 
establishment of a new baseline  (the grading guide for atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84744] : Section  17.11, Appendix K). 
10.3.18  Neurosensory  Testing  
Neurosensory testing  of the skin surrounding the incision (will be conducted per the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1). This evaluation will include the details described i n 
Section  17.[ADDRESS_92476] 
be designated as a neurologic AE. Patient s will be followed until there is full return to 
baseline for the neurosensory ass essment or until there is a determination that it has 
reached a resolution or establishment of a new baseline .

All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time the patient  has signed the ICF until 
D29 + 2 days after the completion of surgery or later, as necessary . All SAEs and non-serious 
AEs will be documented and followed from the time of administration of study treatment 
until D29 or until resolution or establishment of a new baseline . AEs that occur between  
Screening and the surgery  should be considered medical history, and be added to the 
patient ’s medical record , unless related to a study -related  procedure  (such as phlebotomy), in 
which case it will be recorded as a non -treatment emergent AE . SAEs and AEs that have 
been designated as possibly related to study drug will be followed until resolution or  
stabilization . Further details on AEs, including definitions, elicitation, and reporting are 
provided in Section  11.

Safety endpoints include the following:  
Incidence of spontaneously reported TEAEs or serious AEs (SAEs) from study medication 
administration through D29 or later if necessary:  
◦ TEAEs are defined as AEs occurring post study medication administration  
◦ AEs recorded from  the time the ICF is signed up to study medication 
administration will be recorded in medical history.  
◦ Note: A n unscheduled  PK sample should be collected where feasible during the 
inpatient phase of the study for all patients as part of the evaluation of a ny SAE or 
severe TEAE.  
PE: full PE at Screening (without a breast, genital, or rectal examination). Interim targeted 
PE on D1 prior to surgery (can be done on the day before surgery if check -in occurs then), 
T96, and as an outpatient on D8, D15 and D29 (l ater if necessary).  
Vital  signs  (HR, BP, RR ], O 2 saturation [SpO 2]) at screening, D1  prior to surgery, 
postsurgery T1, T2, T6, T12, and T24, and every 12 hours thereafter until T96  (see 
Section  10.3.14 ), and as an outpatient on D8, D15 and D29 or later if necessary. Assess 
temperature on D1 prior to surgery. Temperature will be recorded daily along with vital signs 
per site SOPs at 2, 6, 12, 24, and every 12  hours thereafter until discharge from the inpa tient 
facility (if awake at the time of assessment between hours of midnight and 6:00 AM).  
Surgical  site assessments at T96 prior to discharge from the inpatient unit and then as an 
outpatient on D8, D15 and D29 (later if necessary). If there are skin rea ctions atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84745], e.g., more than expected erythema, drainage, bruising or hematoma, 
induration, swelling, or other skin changes, they should be documented as AEs, graded for 
severity, and followed regularly until resolution or estab lishment of a new baseline.  
Neurosensory  testing near the incision will be performed at Screening visit, T96 (prior to 
discharge from the inpatient unit) and then as an outpatient on D8 and D29.  
◦ Numbness at or near , i.e., within 5 cm of  the incision need n ot be considered a 
neurologic AE since this could occur because of tissue trauma and inflammation 
from the surgery.  Persistent numbness would meet the criteria for an AE. 
◦ Sensory deficits or clinically significant persistent sensory change beyond the area 
proximal/ distal  to the incision at time of discharge, such as allodynia or 
hyperalgesia, must be designated as a neurologic AE. Patients will be followed 
until there is a return to baseline or establishment of a new baseline.

10.4.2  Pharmacokinetic  Endpoints  
Full details of  PK will be described in  a separate PK Analysis Plan . The time points for 
whole blood collection are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  1) and 
Section  10.3.20 .  
Plasma concentration for CA-008 and key metabolite(s) (including capsaicin and CA -101) at 
PK sampling times will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including mean, standard 
deviation ( SD), median, minimum and maximum values, and coefficient of variation (CV%) . 
PK parameters inc lude (but are not limited to) maximum observed plasma drug concentration 
(Cmax), time to maximum plasma drug concentration (T max), half -life, and area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve ( PK-AUC). Actual sampling times will be used to calculate 
plasm a-derived PK parameters.  
For the cQT analysis, QTc intervals will be matched with plasma concentrations for CA-008, 
capsaicin, and CA -101 and analyzed to describe the relationship between concentration and 
QTc using non linear mixed effects modeling. Metho dologic details and r esults will be

11.1 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) and the International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) 
Clinical Safety Data Management Guidance for Industry, E2A, will be used to identify AEs 
in this study.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a pharmaceu tical 
product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended  sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormali ty, temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product.  
Since this is a study using a surgical pain model, findings that are “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” for the surgery 
should not be captured as an AE. Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84746].  
A “suspected adverse reaction” means any AE for which there is a reasonable  possibility that 
the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility ” means there i s evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_92481] abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration which  makes a causal relationship 
impro bable or if other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide more 
plausible  explanations.  
While temporal sequence may be an important factor in determining causality: 
i.e., whether the observed reaction or event began after the study treatment, it may 
well be that the surgery, anesthesia, a concurrent medical condition or concomitant 
medications administered during or after surgery were more likely than not to be 
responsible for the AE. The Investigator  should use clinical judgment to evaluate 
the evidence and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that study 
treatment actually caused the AE or whether based upon the evidence it is more 
likely that something else is responsible. If the former, choose “possibly related” 
and if the latter, “unlikely related.”  
For the purpose of this protocol, the term “unlikely related” will be considered an 
AE not related to study treatment.  
Possibly related  A clinical event, incl uding laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, which also may be explained by

concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. In such cases, if the Investigator  
using clinical judgment is unable to rule o ut a reasonable possibility that study 
treatment was partly responsible, then choose “possibly related.”  
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has possible relationship to study 
treatment will be defined as a “Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction”.   
Probably related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to study treatment administration, in which the Investigator  has 
determined that the event is unlikely to be attributed to other factors.  
For the purpos e of this protocol, an event that has probable relationship to study 
treatment will be defined as an “Adverse Drug Reaction”.

new AEs, worseni ng baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease -
related signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findings that 
the Investigator  feels are clinically significant.  
Disease -related signs  and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as 
AEs unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.  
Information collected concerning AEs will include the following:  
Name [CONTACT_84829]  (i.e., mild, moderate , or severe)  
Relationship  to study treatment  
Action  and outcome  
Seriousness  of event  
 
All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time the patient  has signed the ICF until 
D29 + 2 days after the completion of surgery.  All SAEs and non -serious AEs will be 
documented and followed from the time of administration of study treatment until D29 or 
later if necessary. AEs that occur between Screening and the administration of study 
medication should be considered medical histor y and added to the patient ’s medical record, 
unless the AE is due to a study -related procedure (such as phlebotomy), in which case it will 
be recorded as a non -treatment emergent AE. SAEs and AEs that have been designated as 
possibly related to study treat ment will be followed until resolution or stabilization.

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 112 of 147 11.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE or reaction is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
Death  
Is life-threatening (at the time of the event)  
Requires  patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
Results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring ) 
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a  SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient  and/or may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definitio n. 
 
All AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a pre -existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84747] ≥ [ADDRESS_92483] be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF: study specified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], short -term administrative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84748], tests or treatments of conditions that would not otherwise 
constitute a SAE, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Serious AEs must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hour s of knowledge of 
the event. All SAEs that occur while a patient  is receiving study treatment and within 14  days 
following the study completion visit (or 21 days following an  early termination  [ET] if 
applicable) are reportable within 24 hours. During this  follow -up period beyond study 
completion or after an ET, only those SAEs considered to be possibly related to study 
treatment should be reported within 24  hours.  
The procedure for reporting a SAE is as follows:  
All SAEs must be reported immediately (withi n 24 hours of discovery) by [CONTACT_84804]. Calls related to SAEs should first be directed 
to the CRO medical monitor or designee.  
The Sponsor’s medical monitor is available for questions about safety -related issues  
or to req uest waivers to modify post-operative  patient  care.  
The initial report should include all information known at the time of the report 
(additional  information can be reported as discovered).  Do not delay the initial 
reporting to obtain resolution or follow -up information.

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 113 of 147 The site will enter into the electronic database  a SAE report, or similar form, that 
includes the following information, as available:  
◦ Patient  ID; 
◦ Basic  demographic information (age, gender, weight) ; 
◦ Outcomes  attributed to the event (death, life -threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [new 
or prolonged], disability, congenital anomaly, required medical intervention to 
prevent permanent impairment/damage, etc.) ; 
◦ Onset  date and severity of the event ; 
◦ Brief description of th e event including frequency and severity of symptoms 
leading to diagnosis ; 
◦ List of relevant test results and laboratory data ; 
◦ Any other relevant history ; 
◦ Whether  the study treatment was discontinued ; 
◦ Investigator ’s assessment of causality . 
 
The CRO medical  monitor or another representative of the Sponsor may contact [CONTACT_84805]. 
All SAEs will be entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the 
SAE report and the AE CRF. The Investigator  is responsible for the complete and timel y 
reporting of all SAEs to the Sponsor (or designee), reporting pertinent follow -up information 
on the SAE, and notifying the appropriate IRB of the occurrence of and details surrounding 
the event. In the event there is a question as to whether the AE is s erious, the event should be 
reported.  
11.2 Severity  Grading for AEs  
Grading the severity of AEs is per Investigator  discretion (the guidance reflected in 
Sections  17.4, 17.3 and 17.1; Appendices I , J, and K, respectively,  may be helpful). 
Additionally, the following general guideline ma y be helpful : 
Grade 1 (mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms requiring no treatment, only 
clinical or diagnostic observation  
Grade 2 ( moderate ) = event or symptoms limit age -appropriate activities of daily 
living  (ADLs)  more than is expected from the surgery itself , requiring minimal 
treatment or local noninvasive intervention indicated .  
Grade 3 ( severe ) = medically significant  but not immediately life -threatening, 
significantly limiting of self -care ADLs, requiring of medical treatment and may 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318].  
Grade  4 (potentially life -threatening) .

pregnancy. The Investigator  will be required to follow the patient  through the pregnancy 
term, and report to the CRO medical monitor or designee the course of the pregnancy, 
including perinatal or ne onatal outcome.  Information on the status of the mother and the 
child will be forwarded to the CRO medical monitor or designee.  Any premature termination 
of the pregnancy will also be reported on this form. Although pregnancy occurring in a 
clinical study is not considered to be a  SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE and will be 
followed as such. A spontaneous abortion is considered to be a  SAE.

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 115 of 147 12 DATA  QUALITY ASSURANCE  
This study  will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. In order t o ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee may conduct 
a quality assurance audit, as outlined in Section  12.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
Investigator s and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigato r and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, completeness,  and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor or designee 
will review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits 
and after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be  resolved with the Investigator , 
as appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non -compliance will be investigated,  and remedial action 
instituted when appropriate.  Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in 
investigational site termination and r egulatory authority notification.  
12.1 Data Collection  
Source documents include , but are not limited to , original documents, data and records such 
as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab oratory  
results, participant  diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic 
media, and pharmacy records, etc. This study will use EDC. At a minimum, all data required 
by [CONTACT_84806].  
All eCRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_12555]’s monitor or 
designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or designated representative will review all 
source records on -site and compare them to the data recorded  on the eCRF . All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_84807]. All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_84808]. The EDC  system maintains a full audit trail.  
12.2 Study Au diting and Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing eCRFs for accuracy and 
completeness) will be performed by [CONTACT_1034]’s designated monitor(s). The extent, nature,

The statistical methods to be employed in assessing the safety and efficacy of CA-008 in 
patients undergoing VHR  in accordance with this Phase 1/[ADDRESS_92485] to the 
analyses specified.

In Part A and Part B, no formal statistical hypothesis testing is currently planned . The sample 
size of 8–12 initial patients in P art A, with the potential for expansion  to 16 , and 24–[ADDRESS_92486] been selected empi[INVESTIGATOR_84749]-008 and is considered sufficient for exploration of feasibility, PK, preliminary efficacy, 
tolerabil ity and safety parameters.  
In Part C, a total of up to ~100 patients will be randomized in 2 parallel arms (1:1 ) with 
~50 patients in each arm  to bring the total number of patients enrolled to ~[ADDRESS_92487] for the difference in 2 independent means, a sample size of approximately 40  patients 
per group would provide approximately 80% power to detect a standardized effect size 
(Cohen’s d) of ~0.[ADDRESS_92488] NRS AUC 0-96. 
In Part C, randomization may be stratified based on the size of the ventral hernia:  
for example, < 4 cm vs. ≥ [ADDRESS_92489] size lead to a different number of 
patients per group. The total number of patients to be enrolled in the study will not exceed 
~150.  
13.2 Analysis  Populations  
The following 6 analysis populations are p lanned for this study:  
Safety Population  consists of  all patient s who received any part of a dose of study 
treatment. (Note this must include anyone who terminates early for lack of efficacy).  
PK Population  consists of all patient s who receive d a full dos e of study treatment and 
complete d at least one PK assessment.  
PK/QT Population for cQT analysis consists of all patients with at least one time 
point with both PK and QT data.  
Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) Population  consists of all patient s who receive d any 
dose of study treatment . Per Protocol  (PP) Population  consists of all patient s who 
receive d a full dose of study treatment and have evaluable NRS pain assessments at 
least through T96  (± 4 h)/Discharge.

been discontinued from the study. Note: If after the surgery is underway, it becomes evident 
that the surgical mesh must be placed intra -peritoneally (i.e., IPOM tec hnique), then the 
patient will not receive study drug. In Parts B and C, this patient would be considered 
randomized but not treated.  
The study will be unblinded after patient membership in each of the various analysis 
populations has been determined at a blinded data review meeting and upon confirmation of 
database lock.  
Any deviations from the analyses presented in the SAP will be detailed in the clinical study 
report.  
Progression from Part A to Part B will take place after a  formal safety  assessment has been 
completed showing that the total study drug dose, volume, allocation and technique is 
acceptably safe and feasible.  The formal safety assessment will be conducted by [CONTACT_429]’s medical monitor, the CRO medical monitor, the relevant Principal Investigator, 
and an independent medical monitor.  
Progression from Part B to Part C will take place after an (“interim”) analysis of 
unmonitored, unblinded data from Part B occurs including data through Day  15. This 
analysis will assess prelimina rily the safety and tolerability of the active study drug as well as 
the duration and severity of postsurgical pain in the control group.  
Efficacy, PK, and other assessments will be summarized using appropriate descriptive 
statistics. A detailed methodology for the statistical analyses of the data collected in this 
study will be documented in the SAP, PK Analysis Plan and cQT Analysis Plan, which will 
be signed prior to the database lock.  
All safety assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the Safety 
Population. All safety summaries will be grouped by [CONTACT_84810]. Data from 
all patients receiving veh icle placebo will be combined for summaries.

normal range from baseline to each study visit will also be presented by [CONTACT_84812]. The Investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
All data recorded in the study database will be included in data listings. Any spurious or 
erroneous data will be qu eried and followed up until satisfactorily resolved; if not resolvable, 
the data will be set to missing.  
Summary statistics —number of patients (n), mean, SD, standard error of mean (SEM), (if 
appropriate),  median, minimum, and maximum —will be presented for  continuous variables. 
Frequencies and percentages will be presented for categorical variables. Unless otherwise 
noted, percentages will be calculated using the total number of patients in the appropriate 
population and/or subgroup and per treatment group , where applicable.  Changes from 
baseline for continuous outcomes will be presented as their corresponding continuous 
measures for post -baseline visits. All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], patient , 
and time point.  
Statistical testing includin g p-values and confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented as 
described in each section  below.  
Tests of statistical significance will be 1 -sided or 2 -sided (as described in the S AP) at the 
0.05 level  of significance. Because preliminary assessments of ef ficacy are the focus of 
efficacy analyses, no adjustments in the level of significance will be made for multiple 
comparison tests.

13.4.5  General Considerations  
All analyses will be performed usin g SAS® version 9.3 or higher. The Clinical Data 
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model) domain 
data sets and the ADaM (Analysis Data Model) analysis data sets employed in generating the 
tables, figures, and listings (TFL s) specified in the SAP will be provided to the Sponsor  
along with the generated TFLs. The specifications for the domain data sets and analysis data 
sets will be provided in a separate document.  
The following conventions will be used throughout the study a nalysis:  
Time T0 for efficacy measures is the time of admission into the PACU and will be 
designated by T0.  
The timing of PK assessments is based on the time at pre-dose ( 2-[ADDRESS_92492] study treatment instillation ) designated PKT  = 0. 
For safety assessments, TEAEs will be considered those AEs with onset after the 
beginning of study treatment  administration.  
Day of surgery/study treatment  administration is defined as D1.  
Elapsed assessment visit times are defined by [CONTACT_84816] T0 or D1.  
The baseline value of any parameter is defined as the last valid measurement of that 
parameter prior to the beginning of study treatment administration.  
The change from baseline value of a parameter is defined as the post -baseline value 
minus the ba seline value.  
Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and 
as hours for AEs lasting less than 24 hours. Missing dates will be imputed as 
described in the SAP.

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 121 of 147 13.4.6  Analysis  of Efficacy Me asures  
All efficacy endpoints using  NRS score s will be summarized over time by [CONTACT_84817].  
There are no efficacy endpoints for Part A  and Part B . 
In Part C, the primary efficacy endpoint is the area under the curve  (AUC)  for NRS at rest 
versus time from  T0 to T96 (AUC 0-96). NRS AUC is the weighted SPI [INVESTIGATOR_84750] a 
specified time interval.  
AUC calculations  will be done using the standard trapezoidal rule :  
 
AUC𝑇1−𝑇2=∑NRS𝑖−1+NRS𝑖
2𝑛
𝑖=1(𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑖−1) 
 
Where 𝑁𝑅𝑆𝑖 = NRS at time i, n is the number of minutes between T1 and T2, and (𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑖−1) 
is the time difference in minutes between time  i and time i − 1. A similar calculation and 
handling of missing data will be performed for the NRS scores with position changes.  
Missing NRS values will be handled as discussed in the SAP.  
The AUC analyses will be presented in a summary table with standard summary statistics for 
each dose cohort and placebo as  well as active vs. placebo mean differences, standard errors, 
confidence intervals , and comparison p -values , as appropriate. Comparisons of individual 
dose cohorts for dose response may also be presented for certain secondary AUC endpoints.  
Mean NRS score s over time (in -clinic and diary) will be graphed over time by [CONTACT_6490]. NRS over time by [CONTACT_84818]. The 
individual NRS and the computed AUC values  will be listed for all individual patient s.  
In thi s study, patient s are permitted to take rescue medication for analgesia. It is anticipated 
that patient s randomized to placebo will take rescue medication more often  than patients on 
active treatment . During both inpatient and outpatient portions of the studies, a pre -rescue  
NRS  should be recorded just prior to taking rescue medication , i.e., reflecting the pain level 
triggering the need for rescue analgesia . 
For patient s who take rescue medication a windowed last pain score carried forward 
(wLOCF) will be used  in the calculation of the NRS AUC . The pre -rescue pain score will be 
used to impute scheduled assessments for 30  minutes following the rescue use when IV 
fentanyl is used, 2 hours when IV hydrom orphone is used, and 4 hours when PO oxycodone 
is used. Intermittent missing pain scores (due to patient  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not be imputed, 
and AUC will be calculated based on non -missing values.  
Sensitivity analys es of the primary efficacy variable usi ng additional  methods of imputation 
for rescue medication may also  be performed. Exploratory analyses of the primary efficacy

Amendment 2:  March  15, 202 1 Page 122 of 147 variable using alternative methods may also be performed, e.g., mixed effects modeling and 
Silverman Rank Analysis. In addition, e xploratory analyses of combined active vs. placebo 
and high -dose active vs low -dose active may be performed. Information is provided in the 
SAP.  
For secondary continuous efficacy endpoints based on the NRS scores, similar methods as 
the primary analysis will be used.  
13.4.7  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to minimize missing data . These efforts will include the following:  
Data will be collected regardless of study status or rescue use unless patient  
withdraws consent or is lost to follow up ; 
Continue data collection after patient s take rescue medication . 
With the procedures above, it is expected that the missing data would be minimal  and 
random . Additional sensitivity analyses  may be performed to assess the robustness of 
analysis  conclusions, if warranted ; details will be  presented in the SAP.  
For patients who drop out of the study prior to D15 due to lack of eff icacy (LOE ) or AEs, 
scheduled assessments may be imputed using worst prior pain score carried forward. For 
patients who drop out of the study prior to D15, scheduled NRS assessments will first be 
imputed using the worst prior pain score carried forward (WOCF).  
As se nsitivity analyses, the NRS AUC may also be calculated where, for each patient, 
assessments after dropout will be imputed by : (1) using LOCF; (2) using the last scheduled 
non-missing NRS prior to drop out; (3) the median NRS of the patients continuing in t he

imputation of missing data.

Ask the patien t to close their eyes and indicate when the touch is felt.  
Monofilament (von Frey) Testing:  For this examination, the filament should 
initially be prestressed (4 -6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the 
examiner’s first finger). The filament is then applied  perpendicularly at the location to 
be assessed and briefly, (<1 second) with even pressure. When the fil ament bends, the 
force of 10 grams has been applied. The patient , whose eyes are closed, is asked to 
respond yes if he / she feels the filament. Eight correct responses out of 10 
applications is considered normal: one to seven correct responses indicate re duced 
sensation and no correct responses translates into absent sensation.   
Testing for Allodynia: Performed  at the location to be assessed using a foam brush . 
Note that allodynia testing is best assessed by [CONTACT_84828], and while it may 
be elicited using von Frey filament testing , document presence of allodynia only with

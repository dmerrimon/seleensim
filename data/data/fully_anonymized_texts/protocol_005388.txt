 1 Study Overview  
This Phase II randomized clinical study is designed to examine the efficacy of 
anti-CD3/CD28 activated marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (aMILs) alone or in 
combination with an allogeneic myeloma, GM -CSF vaccine in study subjects 
undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant for the  treatment of multiple 
myeloma. 16  patients will be treated with aMILs alone and 16 with aMILs plus 
the vaccine.  
 
Patients will undergo a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_409889]  (MILs)  that will be used to produce aMILs .  The MILs can either 
be obtained at diagnosis prior to the initiation of induction treatment or upon 
completion of induction therapy.  MILs are collected by [CONTACT_57925][INVESTIGATOR_409890] ~200ml of marrow.  This product will be used to expand the aMILs. Durin g 
the in vitro  expansion process, T cells will be activated and ex vivo  expanded by 
[CONTACT_3252]-stimulation with anti -CD3 and anti -CD28 monoclonal antibodies covalently 
attached to super -paramagnetic microbeads. Patients will be treated with a 
standard high -dose ch emotherapy regimen for multiple myeloma consisting of 
single agent melphalan (200mg/m2).  Patients will then receive their stem cells. 
Three days (Day 3) following stem cell infusion, patients will receive a single 
infusion aMILs.  Because of the potential  negative impact of G -CSF on T cell 
trafficking to the bone marrow, patients will not receive post -transplant G -CSF.  
For patients assigned to the vaccine arm, the first vaccine will be administered [ADDRESS_516896] of two 
irradiated allogeneic myeloma cell lines, H929 and U266 admixed with 
K562/GM -CSF.  
 
Disease response as determined by [CONTACT_409916]’ criteria will be the prim ary 
endpoint of the trial at one year. Additional study endpoints include progression 
free survival, parameters of T cell reconstitution, anti -tumor immune responses 
as well as the effect on osteoclastogenesis and clonogenic myeloma precursor 
cells.

[ADDRESS_516902] common cancer of 
the bone marrow. [1, 2]  In 2008, the estimated incidence of myeloma in United 
States was 19,920.   
 
Multiple myeloma is most often diagnosed in middle aged and elderly 
individu als. The most common sites of disease are the bone and bone marrow. 
Malignant plasma cells arise from clonal expansion and accumulate in the bone 
marrow in masses known as plasmacytomas. These plasma cells produce large 
amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulin s, most commonly IgG (50 -60%) and 
IgA (20 -25%) and occasionally IgD, IgM and IgE. [3]Patients often suffer from 
bone pain and  skeletal fragility. [4]  Plasmacytomas are osteolytic in nature and 
often confined to the central skeleton, skull, and femur.  Bone destruction is 
usually localized but can be present throughout the skeleton. [5] 
 
The etiology remains unk nown, but risk factors are thought to include chronic 
immune stimulation, autoimmune disorders, exposure to ionizing radiation, 
occupational exposure to pesticides or herbicides, occupational exposure to 
dioxin, and perhaps prolonged use of certain hair co loring products. [6, 7] 
 
The diagnosis is made using several criteria including results of radiographic 
skeletal survey, bone  marrow examination, and measurement of serum and/or 
urine monoclonal protein (M -protein). [8, 9]  Patients are also classified by [CONTACT_64367] 
(Stage I, II, III) according to the status of bone lesions, hemoglobin, serum 
calcium, β-2 microglobulin, C -reactive protein and M -protein. [10] The M -
protein is often used to monitor response to treatment via measurement of serum 
and/or urine analysis of Bence -Jones protein, the light chain component of the 
M-protein.  
 
Multiple myeloma is a largely incurable disorder and most pati ents will die of 
their disease.  A variety of chemotherapy agents have been used to treat the 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University

 disease but few patients experience long -term disease -free survival with current 
therapeutic approaches.  The median overall survival for patients is 
approximatel y three years. [11, 12]  There is an urgent need for more effective 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_409891].   
3.[ADDRESS_516904] patients.  Approximately 40% of patients demonstrate a  greater than 
75% reduction in the M -protein. [13] However, nearly all patients will 
eventually fail this treatment and the median overall survival is only 3 years 
with this therapy. [13] A variety of different combination chemotherapy 
regimens have been developed in an attempt to improve on these results.  
Unfortunately, regardless of the type of initial treatment, the disease will recur 
and the 5 -year survival is less than 30%. [13, 14]   
 
Dose intensification using high -dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_409918]. [15-26] In 1996, 
the French Myeloma Intergroup reported the results of a randomized clinical 
trial, which compared high -dose chemotherapy supported by [CONTACT_409919] l chemotherapy in patients with previously 
untreated multiple myeloma. [22] The study demonstrated the superiority of 
high-dose therapy in terms of response rate, event -free survival and overall 
patient surviva l.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_409892] -dose 
chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support as standard of care in multiple 
myeloma patients with good performance status.  
 
The Southwest Oncology Group study of 72 patients with chemotherapy -
refractory multiple myeloma treated with high - dose melphalan (200 mg/m2) 
followed by [CONTACT_409920]. [15](16)  
The regimen was well tolerated resulting in an overall response rate of 65% 
with approximately 30% of patients achieving complete remission.  The median 
progression -free survival was [ADDRESS_516905] disease (GVHD) and substantial mortality, which has limited its use. [27]  
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516906] immune responses .  T cells b ecome activated when they recognize 
antigens, specific elements of microbes or tumor cells, as foreign to the body.  
This occurs when antigens are taken up, processed and presented by [CONTACT_409921] -
presenting cell (APC) to a molecular complex on the T cell.  This molecular 
complex contains the T cell receptor (TCR) associated with the CD3 signaling 
complex. [27] 
 
The primary signal for activating a T cell takes place when the TCR expressed 
on its surface binds to a processed antigen present on the surface of an APC.  
Each individual T cell only expresses a single TCR capable of recognizing a 
specific antigen.  However,  the many billions of T cells found in the human 
body express millions of different TCRs, thereby [CONTACT_409922].  Only a specific T cell that recognizes a particular 
antigen will become activated during a normal immu ne response.  
 
APCs must deliver a second signal in order to activate T cells.  This co -
stimulatory signal occurs when receptors on APCs bind to CD28 receptors on T 
cells.  Activation of T cells takes place when APCs bind to the TCR/CD3 
complex and CD28 re ceptor.  These activated T cells are exquisitely sensitive to 
further stimulation and also secrete a variety of chemical messengers called 
cytokines.  This process further augments the immune response both by [CONTACT_409923] T cells and recruiting and stimulating 
other cells of the immune system.  This cascade of events ultimately leads to 
destruction of pathogens such as tumor cells and viruses.   
3.4 Immune Defects in Patients with Cancer Including Multiple Myeloma  
The inabi lity of a patient's own immune system to respond to and control cancer 
may be due to a number of problems.  Defects in both the afferent (responding) 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516907] 06 , 2010  
 
14 
 as well as efferent (acting) arms of the immune system are well documented in 
cancer patients.  Deficits i n the afferent arm of immunity include zeta chain 
defects in the TCR, which contribute to signaling problems in T cells.  In 
addition, patients with hematological malignancies including chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma demonstrate signific ant narrowing 
of the broad spectrum of T cell receptors present in healthy individuals. [28-30] 
This narrow T cell receptor repertoire may limit the patient’s ability to 
recognize and respond to tumor cells as well as other pathogens.  This may 
contribute not only to cancer progres sion, but also to the infections that are 
often observed in patients with hematological malignancies. These defects are 
both a result of the malignancy itself as well as cytotoxic therapy that can 
damage T cells.  Additionally, ineffective induction of CD4 0L (CD154) on T 
cells has been demonstrated in cancer patients. [31] Without CD40L signaling, 
APCs are not capable of being activate d or presenting antigen to T cells.  Poor 
co-stimulation by [CONTACT_409924] -responsive elements or defects in the co -
stimulatory pathway has been observed in cancer patients. [27]   Problems with 
the effector arm of the immune system in cancer patients include the presence 
of relatively low numbers of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which are 
required to kill the tum or cells.  Additionally, some cancers including multiple 
myeloma produce cytokines that inhibit the function of normal T cells or 
APCs. [32] The deficits in immunity may limit the ability of the patients' own T 
cells to mount an effective immune response to their own cancers.  
3.[ADDRESS_516908]’s immune system are 
present in patients with cancer including multiple myeloma.  These deficits are 
thought to play a role in the patient’s  inability to generate an anti -tumor 
response and control the disease.  A variety of therapeutic approaches are now 
being developed that stimulate the patient’s immune system.  Several groups are 
using idiotype vaccines to stimulate T cell -mediated respons es to the patient’s 
tumor cells. [33, 34]  Using this approach, patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_409893], which is 
derived from their unique M -protein.  Promising clinical results have been 
observed in some of these clinical trials.  However, many patients have 
weakened immune systems after the transplant and have been unable to respond 
to the vaccine [35]  
 
We have recently completed a clinical study utilizing autologou s tumor 
vaccines in the autologous transplant setting.  In this study, newly diagnosed 
patients underwent a bone marrow collection to obtain autologous tumor that 
was combined with the K562/GM -CSF producing by[CONTACT_409925] [36]. Patients were administered the vaccine pre -transplant 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516909] -transplant setting [37]. While this study showed 
evidence of the generation of tumor -specific T cell responses, the degree of 
lymphopenia post -transplantation was greater than initially predicted with 
absolute CD4 numbers considerably below normal up to one year post -
transplant.  One attempt to increase vaccine efficacy is the ability to enhance T 
cell reconstitution and utilize vaccines at a time when maximal T cell 
responsiveness can be guarantee d. 
 
Recently, several investigators have documented the potent anti -tumor effects of 
donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) administered to patients who relapse after 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation. [38-42] Unfortunately, a high incidence of 
GVHD has been observed with DLI, which h as significantly limited its 
therapeutic application.  
 
Investigators have documented that T cells with anti -tumor activity are present 
in the blood of patients with multiple myeloma. [43] If sufficient numbers of the 
patient’s own T cells co uld be activated and expanded, they could be used in 
combination with an autologous stem cell transplant.  This would provide a 
potentially safer therapeutic alternative to DLI.  Patients would avoid the risks 
of GVHD as well as the substantial morbidity a nd mortality (up to 40%) that 
has been documented in multiple myeloma patients undergoing allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation. [44] 
 
Additionally, recent clinical data provide further rationale for the administration 
of autologous T cells in patients undergoing autologous stem cell 
transplantation.  Several clinical studies have documented improved therapeutic 
outcome in patients with multiple myeloma (as well as non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer), who experience more r apid 
and/or complete recovery of their peripheral blood lymphocytes after 
autologous stem cell transplantation. [45-47]  
3.6 Rationale for the Use of CD3xCD28 Bead -Activated T Cells  
Carl June and colleagues developed technology to activate T cells of the 
immune system outside of the body ( ex vivo )[48].  This procedure is based on 
the roles of the CD3 signaling complex and CD28 receptor in the activation of T 
cells.  In the manufacturing process, T cells are stimulated ex vivo  using  
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516910] shown that T cells can be generated ex vivo  using these 
beads from patients with human immunodeficiency v irus (HIV) or cancer. [49,

Studies have demonstrated that T cells can be activated and expanded more than 
one hundred fold in less than 10 -12 days with anti -CD3/CD28 bead activation 
with a predominant expansion of CD4 over CD8 T cells.  Further studies have 
shown that the patients’ activated T Cells express high levels of CD154 
(CD40L), CD137 (4 -1BB) and other key effector molecules s uch as CD134 
(OX-40), CD54 (ICAM) as well as important receptors such as CD25 (IL -2 
receptor).  Finally, this process generates T cells that display a Th1 phenotype

technology. T cells activated in this manner have previously bee n tested in 
patients undergoing a autologous stem cell transplant for relapsed or refractory 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [51]. T cells were collected prior to high -dose 
chemotherapy. Fourteen days following the peripheral blood stem cell infusion, 
activated and expanded T cell s were administered.  Three patients were treated 
at a median cell dose of 0.[ADDRESS_516912]

Maximal responses included five patients with complete responses, seven 
patients with partial responses, and five patients with stable disease.  
 
We recently completed a Phase I/II study in multiple myeloma in which 32 
patients were administered anti -CD3/CD28 activated T cells.  T cells were 
effectively expanded in all patients with an average fold -increase of 268 (± 
101).  T cells were then infus ed on day + 3 following an autologous stem cell 
transplant.  Interestingly, in addition to the in vitro expansion, patients 
experienced an additional in vivo expansion reaching maximal expansion on

overcome the inherent

T cell from tumor -
bearing hosts and to 
expand upon anti -
CD3/CD28 stimulation.  
This data also 
underscores a significant 
limitation of the  
polyclonal expansion 
that lacks antigen 
specificity.  To this 
effect, we have 
attempted to develop 
strategies aimed at 
increasing the tumor 
specificity of this 
approach.  Specifically, 
we have discovered that marrow infiltrating lymphocytes can be effecti vely 
activated and expanded with properties suggestive of an effector/memory 
population.  More importantly, they possess several critical features required for 
effective anti -tumor adoptive immunotherapy:  1) they can be activated and 
expanded to reasonabl e numbers; 2) they demonstrate significant specificity 
against  mature plasma cells.  PBLs or MILs were activated for 5 days in vitro 
and tumor specificity was assessed by [CONTACT_409926]. As shown in Figure 1 , whereas activated PBLs (aPBLs) 
failed to show measurable tumor specificity, activated MILs (aMILs) exhibited 
marked tumor reactivity.  Interestingly, no reactivity was appreciated against 
Figure 1: aMILs exhibit marked anti -myeloma activity.   
T cells from blood or marrow were either activated with anti -
CD3/CD28 beads or left unstimulated.  Tumor specificity was 
determined by [CONTACT_409927] (CD138), autologous non -malignant myeloid cells (CD33) or 
nothing and determining H -thymidine incorporation  
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516915] of effective adoptive immunotherapy is the ability of T 
cells to traffic to the tumor microenvironment.  SDF -1 (stromal derived factor -
1) and its cognate chemokine receptor, CXCR4 are critical factors in cell 
trafficking in t he marrow.  We have shown that a significantly higher 
percentage of MILs express CXCR4 as compared to PBLs thus increasing the 
likelihood of trafficking of these cells to the appropriate compartment.  [52].  To 
confirm this, we performed an experiment utilizing NOD/SCID mice.  Mice 
were irradiated and challenged with the H929 myeloma cell line and then 18 
days later either given activated MILs, activated PBLs or no T cells.  The T cell 
doses used corresponded to 
doses ranging from 3 – 20 x 
107 CD3/kg (doses easily 
achievable in humans).  As 
shown in Figure [ADDRESS_516916] compared to no T 
cells whereas the mice 
receiving activated MILs 
demonstrated 100% survival 
with no evidence of 
detectable tumor.  
Furthermore, T cells were 
detectable in the marrows of 
mice having received aMILs 
wereas no T cells but 
CD138+ plasma cells were 
seen in the bone marrows of 
mice treated with HBSS or 
aPBLs.  These findings confirm our in vitro data and suggest the overall 
efficacy of this approach.

 cell.  Complete eradication of mature plasma cells will seldomly result in  
sustained remissions.  When marrow from myeloma patients is depleted of 
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells as well as CD138+ plasma cells and CD3+ T 
cells and plated on methylcellulose, there is an outgrowth of CD138+ plasma 
cells with the same light chain re striction of the initial myeloma clone. Early 
evidence that infiltrating T cells may mediate an anti -MM effect was provided by 
[CONTACT_409928] T cells were first  removed from the marrow 
cultures prior to plating. With this knowledge and our data demonstrating a 
greater memory/effector phenotype of MILs over PBLs, we compared the 
number of colonies arising from CD34/CD138 marrow cells depleted of T cells 
to those s een when the same marrow precursors were co -incubated with either 
resting or previously activated PBLs or MILs. These studies showed a clear 
reduction of MM colony growth upon co -incubation with T cells.  Interestingly, 
while aMILs exerted the most potent effect on inhibiting plasma cell colony 
outgrowth, even the add -back of purified, unstimulated MILs demonstrated 
measurable anti -tumor efficacy ( Fig 3 ). It should be noted that CFU -GM colony 
outgrowth was unaltered with the addition of aMILs suggesting the  myeloma 
specificity of aMILs with no reactivity towards normal hematopoietic elements. 
These results demonstrate the ability of in vitro anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation to 
enhance antigen recognition and are consistent with the hypothesis that T cell 
recognition by [CONTACT_409929]138+ 
plasma cells, but also on their progenitors – an observation that if true will 
significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of these cells.

 In summary, several conclusions can be drawn from this data that make adoptive 
therapy utilizing aMILs an approach worthy of pursuing clinically:  1) the tumor 
micro -environment 
of myeloma patients 
contains 
lymphocytes (MILs) 
with greater anti -
tumor specificity 
than is observed in 
peripheral 
lymphocytes; 2) the 
kinetics of T cell 
activation of MILs 
compared to PBLs is 
consistent with 
expansion of a 
memory T cell 
population; 3) anti -
CD3/CD28 beads are 
capable of reversing 
tolerance and 
restoring T cell 
responsiveness to 
tumor -specific antigens; 4) the tumor specificity of aMILs greatly exceeds that of 
aPBLs; 5) aMILs offer the prospect of significantly impairing 
osteoclastogenesis; and 6) MILs exhibit specificity towards a broad range of 
antigens present on both mature plasma cells as well as their clonogenic 
precursors thus offering the theoretical possibility of eradicating the disease.  
aMILs inhibit osteoclastogenesis  
CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are responsible for many aspects of 
immune regulation which limit responses to auto -antigens in preventing 
autoimmunity, to allo -antigens in transplantation tolerance, and even pregnancy.   
In the tumor -bearing host, this regulatory T cell population plays a dominant role 
in suppressing tumor specific immunity and is likely key to the induction of 
tumor antigen associated tolerance. We have shown that the marrow of myeloma 
patients fails to  contain Tregs - a finding with significant implications for 
adoptive T cell transfer.  
Fig 3: Inhibition of Clonogenic Outgrowth.   Bone 
marrow from myeloma patients was depleted of CD34+, 
CD138+ plasma cells, and CD3+ cells, resuspended in 
methylcellulose overnight and t hen plated out and scored for 
the development of CD138+ colonies cultured in the presence 
of various T cell populations.

 In myeloma, both the tumor and the stroma are a major source of IL -6 which in 
combination with TGF  induces an effector Th17 phenotype [53].  Recent 
evidence has suggested that a reciprocal relationship exists between Tregs and 
Th17 cells [54]. A significant amount of literature has recently emerged 
highlighting the role of Th17 cells in autoimmune processes including 
experimental 
autoimmune 
encephalitis, 
inflammatory bowel 
disease and rheumatoid 
arthritis. In attempting 
to unde rstand the 
function of Th17 
effector cells within 
the myelomatous bone 
marrow, we examined 
the role of MILs on 
osteoclastogenesis 
whose activation is 
responsible for the 
lytic bone lesions seen 
in this disease.  
Osteoclasts were 
generated from bone 
marrow of normal 
donors or myeloma patients in the presence of M -CSF and Rank -L.  As shown in 
Fig 4 , the addition of either IL -17 or Th17 -skewed MILs significantly increased 
the number of osteoclasts generated whereas, the addition of IFN dramatically 
reduced th ese numbers.  Interestingly, co -culture of osteoclast precursors with 
aMILs (IFN producing Th1 cells) reduced osteoclast formation to a similar 
degree as IFN alone.  Taken together, these findings provide a biologic rationale 
as to the genesis and functi on of Th17 MILs in the myelomatous bone marrow 
and also explain the absence of Tregs in this disease as compared to normal 
marrow.  Furthermore, in addition to anti -myeloma activity of aMILs, they may 
also play a significant role in limiting osteoclast -induced bone destruction - a 
prospect that could have considerable therapeutic impact and justify the rationale 
for utilizing autologous marrow infiltrating lymphocytes as a means to augment 
myeloma -specific anti -tumor immunity.

osteoclastogenesis.  BM from normal or myeloma patients was

day 21.

BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516920] led to increased response rates and improved survival.  
Nevertheless, only about 30% of patients achieve complete remissions [2 0] and 
few patients achieve durable remissions with this form of therapy .  There is 
increasing interest in using immunotherapeutic approaches in combination with 
high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation to improve 
upon these results.   
 
Utilizing peripheral blood lymphocytes in a previously conducted clinical trial, 
T cells were reproducibly generated from all patients. Delivery of activated T 
cells in the transplant setting is attractive in light of data from both animal and 
human stu dies demonstrating the enhanced activity of T cells when 
administered in a lymphopenic setting [37, 55] .  Furthermore, clinical data 
suggests that patients experiencing more rapid recovery of their peripheral 
blood lymphocytes after autologous stem cell transplan tation have improved 
survival. [45-47] Based on these data, we propose to evaluate the safety, 
feasibility and therapeutic ac tivity of aMILs after high -dose chemotherapy and 
autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.

A CBC with differential and platelets will be obtained prior to stem cell 
infusion.  
 
A minimum of 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg of stem cells will be infused. The 
infusion will occur the day after the last dose of melphalan. Corticosteroids may 
have an adverse effect on the activity of T cells contained in the stem cell 
product, and should therefore be avoided.   See Secti on 0, Contraindicated

 10.7 Supportive  Care  
All patients will receive supportive care according to institutional clinical 
guidelines for autologous stem cell transplantation. This may include but not be 
limited to allopurinol, menstrual suppression, prophylactic antibiotics, empi[INVESTIGATOR_409895] s, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), transfusion of blood products, 
hyperalimentation, and erythropoietin.   
10.[ADDRESS_516940]-transplant filgrastim (Neupogen; G -CSF) will NOT be permitted on this 
trial because of the known ability to downregulate CXCR4 which may 
negatively impact on the ability of aMILs to traffic to the bone marrow 
following infusion.  
 
 
11 Administration of Activated MILs (Day 3)  
11.1 Timing of Infusion of Activated MILs  (aMILs)  
Activated MILs infusions will be sche duled for three days (Day 3) after the 
administration of the s tem cell  product .  Infusion may be delayed if required by 
[CONTACT_409930]’s clinical condition.  
11.2 Evaluations Prior to Activated MILs T Cell Infusion  
The following evaluations will be made prior to infusion of activated MILs:  
 
 Clinical assessment: review of systems, vital signs  
 CBC with differential and platelet count  
 Blood in a heparinized green top tube.  
 Serum chemistries: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, 
creatinine, calcium,  ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, 
albumin  
 Concurrent medication documentation  
 Adverse event documentation  
 
aMILs will not be infused if:  
 Temperature >38.5oC 
 Oxygen saturation < 90% on room air  
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516941] 06 , 2010

  Patient is felt to be clinically unstable by [CONTACT_409931], the cells will be 
infused after at least [ADDRESS_516942] a high fever not 
relieved by [CONTACT_58086].  
 
Intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], hydrocortisone and 
supplemental oxygen will be availab le at the patient’s bedside in the event of 
anaphylaxis or an infusion reaction.  
 
Other medications may also be prescribed to treat additional side effects during 
the course of treatment.  However, there are some medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_409896] T Cell therapy 
and therefore are contraindicated (see Section 0, Contraindicated Medications ). 
In particu lar, patients should not receive systemic corticosteroids  such as 
hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone (Solu -Medrol) or dexamethasone 
(Decadron) at any time, except in the case of a life -threatening emergency, since 
this may have an adverse effect on a ctivated MILs. If steroids are required for 
an acute infusional reaction, an initial dose of hydrocortisone [ADDRESS_516943] blood tubing without an additional filter  
into a peripheral or central IV site. Each of the bags will be infused at a rate of 
approximately 10 ml per minute. Following aMILs infusion, the patient will be 
hydrated with D5W½NS at approximately 20 0 ml per hour for two hours.   
11.5 Safety Monitoring During Administration of Activated MILs  
During the infusion of activated MILs, the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and peripheral oxygen saturation will be 
monitore d approximately as frequently as the following time intervals:  
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University

hypotension) or other serious adverse reaction (i.e., cardiac failure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518], severe nausea  and vomiting) to the, activated MILs the infusion of the 
activated MILs will be stopped immediately and the patient will be provided 
with the supportive care deemed necessary by [CONTACT_409932].  The reaction should be noted as a se rious adverse event, and the IRB 
should be notified within [ADDRESS_516949]-transplant Vaccinations (days 21, 60, 180, 300)  
 
The allogeneic  myeloma vaccine will be administered on day +21, 60 (± 7 
days), 180 (± 14 days) and 300 (± 14 days) post -transplant assuming that 
patients show no evidence of ongoing transplant related toxicity.  
 
The day [ADDRESS_516950] -transplant vaccine will be administered as suming the following 
criteria are met:  
 No active uncontrolled infection  
 Platelet count > 20,000/mm3* 
 Hemoglobin > 8 g/dL*  
 AST/ALT, total bilirubin < 3 -fold normal  
*The patient need not be RBC or platelet -transfusion independent but 
must be able to sustain a Hgb >8g/dL or platelet >20,[ADDRESS_516951] -transplant vaccination will not 
be administered to patients with Grade 2 or high er hematologic toxicities based 
on the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI -CTC) for bone 
marrow transplant studies (platelet count < 20,000/mm3, and hemoglobin 
<8g/dL).   
 
 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University

 Patients who do not meet the eligibility for vaccination will b e evaluated weekly 
until the blood counts improve to Grade 1 or better (platelet count > 
20,000/mm3 and hemoglobin >8g/dL) at which time they will receive the 
vaccine.  
 
The cell lines used for the vaccine preparation have undergone extensive 
regulatory tes ting and have been determined to be sterile and free of mycoplasma 
and viral contamination. The vaccine clinical lots were manufactured and released 
by [CONTACT_409933], a cGMP compliant facility, at 
the Sidney Kimmel Comprehen sive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.  [CONTACT_409958] will submit the manufacturing and product release data to the FDA prior 
to initiating the study. The vaccine cells are irradiated prior to cryopreservation 
and stored frozen in the vapor phase of liquid ni trogen until the day of use. The 
details of production, irradiation, freezing, and preparation for administration are 
discussed in detail in the Investigational New Drug (IND) submission. Equal 
numbers (5 x 107 each) of the myeloma cell lines H929 and U266  cells will be 
combined with the by[CONTACT_409934] K562/GM -CSF (5x106) to prepare the 
vaccine . Vaccine cells frozen in an injectable formulation Pentaspan® (10% 
Pentastarch in 0.9% sodium chloride with 2% human serum albumin and 5% 
DMSO) will be thawed o n the day of vaccination  in a 37ºC water bath , mixed,  
and then taken up into five labeled syringes prior to administration.  The syringes 
are kept on ice until administration.   Injections should be started w ithin 60 
minutes of the thaw.  
 
Toxicities associated with the intravenous administration of Pentaspan® include 
circulatory overload, abnormalities of coagulation (prolonged prothrombin, partial 
thromboplastin and clotting times), and hypersensitivity reactions characterized 
by [CONTACT_322110],  urticaria, hypotension, and anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions.  
Additionally, patients who are allergic to corn can also develop hypersensitivity to 
Pentaspan®.    
 
Each vaccination will consist of five total intra -dermal injections, two each in the 
right and left anterior upper thighs, and one in the non -dominant upper arm 
(unless contraindicated). In the event that the specified limb is contraindicated, 
the dominant  arm may be used. Vaccine injections sites shall be at least [ADDRESS_516953] neighbor. The approximate volume of each 
vaccination injection is approximately 0.3 -0.4ml.  
 
A lidocaine based topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (may include but is not lim ited to EMLA or 
ELA -MAX) cream will be recommended being applied to each injection site 
approximately 1 -2 hours prior to vaccination to diminish the discomfort 
associated with the intra -dermal injections. “Approximately” allows for the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] t o be placed up to two and a half hours prior to the vaccine 
administration. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_409897]

unforeseen adverse events that could result from the interaction of activated 
MILs with the stem cell transplantation therapy.  
14.1 Risks of Venous Access  
Complications associated with venous access for leukapheresis of stem cells  and 
the infusion of stem cells and activated MILs include discomfort, bruising, 
and/or bleeding at the catheter insertion site, thrombosis of the accessed vessel, 
and infection. Complications from placement of a central line required for the 
high-dose che motherapy and stem cell transplantation procedure and activated 
MILs include increased risk and severity of the above complications, as well as 
pneumothorax.

14.3 Potential Microbial Contamination of the Activated MILs  
There is the potential that microorganisms inadvertently introduced during cell 
collection and processing  could cause an infection in the patient following 
infusion of the activated MILs.  All precautions to maintain sterility will be 
taken.  Cultures will be obtained prior to and after completing the T cell

14.4 Potential Toxicity of Storage Solution s 
14.4.1  Dimethyl  Sulfoxide (DMSO)  
aMILs product s and the Myeloma Vaccine are cryopreserved in a solution 
containing approximately 5% DMSO.  DMSO is a cryoprotectant used to store 
a variety of infused cell products including hematopoietic stem cells and bone 
marrow.  Afte r cells are thawed, DMSO contained in the freezing solution is 
infused along with the cells.  Toxicity associated with DMSO infusion is 
usually limited to minor changes in heart rate, blood pressure, fever, chills, 
sweats, nausea, vomiting and headaches.  These are usually self -limited, lasting 
no more than a few hours.  The most notable effect is a garlicky odor due to 
exhalation of a DMSO metabolite that may last up to one day.  More severe 
adverse effects include severe acute allergic reactions including  anaphylactoid 
reactions, pulmonary embolism, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], renal failure, cardiac 
arrhythmias, seizures, and death. [57, 58]  These side effects are rarely observed 
and occur primarily in patients receiving much higher volumes of cryopreserved 
cell prod ucts than being infused in the present study.  Nevertheless, patients will 
be carefully monitored for any adverse effects as outlined in Section 0, Adve rse 
Events .  Any adverse events should be documented and recorded on the 
appropriate Case Report Form.  
14.4.2    Human Serum Albumin (HSA)  
aMILs products and the Myeloma Vaccine are formulated in a cryopr otectant 
containing 2% human serum albumin.  Albumin  solutions are FDA approved 
for volume resuscitation (treatment of hypovolemia, shock, and burns).  
Although hypersensitivity reactions are possible, reactions are not anticipated to 
the small amount of albumin administered.  
 
14.4.3   6% Hetastarch  
 
aMILs are formulated in a cryoprotectant containing 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% 
sodium chloride.  Toxicities associated with the intravenous administration of 
6% Hetastarch include circulatory overload , abnormalities of coagulation 
(prolonged prothrombin, parti al thromboplastin and clotting times), and 
hypersensitivity reactions characterized by [CONTACT_322110], urticaria, hypotension, 
and anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions.

These two allogeneic cell lines have never been used in a vaccine formulation 
prior to this study.  However, considering the vast experience at Johns Hopkins 
alone with other allogeneic  vaccine formulations: breast, prostate and pancreas 
cancer, and the absence of any rate limiting toxicities, we cannot anticipate any

stem cell infusion, activated and expanded T cells were administered.  Three 
patients were treated at a median cell dose of 0.4 x 109, twelve patients were 
treated at a median cell dose of 1.6 x 109, and two patients were treated with a

 It is possible that activated T cells could target the patient’s own tissues, 
resulting in autoimmune disorders.  However, this was thought to be due to 
high-dose IL -2, a known cause of this disorder, which was given with the cell 
therapy.  Autoimmune dis ease has not been observed in previous studies using 
CD3xCD28 bead -activated T cells. Considering that in this case, the 
lymphocytes are obtained from the marrow microenvironment, it is possible that 
an immune response could develop towards normal hematopo ietic elements.

protocol currently in use in our institution.  This will be done per institutional 
practice by [CONTACT_409935]. 
The Investigator is responsible for discussing these risks in detail with the 
patient. The following is a brief overview of the major risks associated with 
autol ogous stem cell transp lantation . 
 
14.7.1  Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Mobilization Chemotherapy Regimen  
 
Patients receive cyclophosphamide chemotherapy and filgrastim to mobilize 
peripheral blood stem cells for collection.  Cyclophosphamide can cause alopecia, 
nausea, vomiting, b ladder irritation and hemorrhage, and myelosuppression 
including anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.  Patients are at risk of 
bleeding and infection.   
 
14.7.2  Administration of Filgrastim (G -CSF)  
   
Filgrastim  is given in the peripheral blood stem cell mobilization regimen and can 
cause significant bone pain in many patients.

J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516972] 06 , 2010  
 
42 
  
14.7.5  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Infusion  
 
The hematopoietic stem cells may become contaminated with microbes during 
their collection or processing.  Infusion of hematopoietic stem cells contaminated 
with microbes such as bacteria could cause an infection.  The hematopoietic stem 
cells are stored i n DMSO.  Similar to the administration of activated MILs, the 
DMSO is infused along with the cells.   
 
 
14.8 Risks of Interactions Between Activated MILs , Tumor Vaccination & 
Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
It is possible there may be unforeseen inte ractions between the activated MILs 
and high -dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_182481]. 
Such interactions could cause, for example, delays in neutrophil or platelet 
recovery, the development of autoimmune disease, or exacerbations of known 
transplant toxicities, such as mucositis.  Patients will be monitored closely for 
hematopoietic engraftment, and adverse events.  
 
 
15 Adverse Events  
 
15.1 Case Report Form Reporting  
Only the adverse events (AEs) occurring during the study from the time of bone 
marrow collections of MILs and myeloma vaccine through Day 360 that are felt 
to be related to the experimental products ( collection or infusion of aMILs  as 
well as vaccine)  and not a result of the standard and accepted toxicity associated 
with autologous stem cell transplantation will be documented and recorded on 
the AE Case Report Form. AEs will not be collected past Day 360 or after the 
patient progresses.  AEs that occur afte r Day 360 or disease progression/relapse 
would likely reflect the disease process, and not the activated MILs or 
vaccination.  
 
Clinically significant laboratory results considered to be possibly related to 
aMILs and not related to autologous stem cell tran splant will also be recorded 
as AEs.  For purposes of this study, clinical significance is defined as any 
laboratory result that is outside the range of normal, as defined by [CONTACT_409936]’s recorded reference range and is deemed clinically significant b y the 
Principal Investigator.  
 
Adverse events and con -meds will be assessed on an on -going basis during 
patient treatment. Serious adverse events and unexpected adverse events will be 
reported per section 15.4. All adverse events documentation related to t he 
infusion of aMILs will continue until resolution of those events.  
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516973] cause.  
 
15.2 Grading of Adverse Events and Toxicities  
AEs and toxicities will be graded using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ).  
AEs that are not inclu ded in the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria will be graded 
as follows:  
  
 Mild (Grade 1) – near the lowest intensity (or within the lower one -
third) typi[INVESTIGATOR_409901]  
 Moderate  (Grade 2)  – average intensity typi[INVESTIGATOR_409902]  
 Severe  (Grade 3)  – near the highest intensity (or within the top third) 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_409901]  
 Life-threatening or disabling  (Grade 4)  – any AE that places the 
patient, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Fatal (Grade 5)  
Note:  These terms are used to describe intensity of a specific event; the 
event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache).  
 
15.3 Attribution  of Causality  
The association or relationship of the AEs to activated MILs or myeloma 
vaccine will be defined according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
guidelines as follows:  
 
 Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study product, e.g., an 
event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug or in which the drug level has been 
established in body fluids or tissues, that fo llows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug, and that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_409903] 
 Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study product, e.g., an 
event that follows a reasonable temporal se quence from 
administration of the drug, that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to the suspected drug, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_007] 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516974]’s clinical state  
 Possible – The AE may be related  to the study product, e.g., an event 
that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug, that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
suspected drug, but that could readily have been produced by a 
number of other facto rs 
 Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study product  
 Unrelated – The AE is clearly not related  to the study product  
 Not applicable – The AE occurred prior to administration of the 
study product  
 Unknown – No evaluation for causality can be made

 15.5 Definitions of Response (Blade’ Criteria)  
 
Definitions of response are adapted from the combined criteria developed for 
patients with multiple myeloma treated by [CONTACT_5019] -dose chemotherapy and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. [63] If confirmation of a measurement is 
required, the date of response/progre ssion/relapse will be the date at which the M -
protein measurement first meets the required criterion. M -protein measurements 
by [CONTACT_159425] (SPEP) will take precedence over quantitative 
immunoglobulins for determining response. The date o f 
response/progression/relapse will be determined by [CONTACT_409938], and not by [CONTACT_409939].  
 
Criteria for Evaluation and Endpoint Definitions  
The serum and urine M -protein levels  obtained at baseline will be used as the 
reference baseline for calculation of increases or decreases in the M -protein level. 
The M -protein levels from the time of diagnosis will also be obtained, and 
response calculations using that value as baseline wil l also be performed in 
secondary analyses.  
 
15.5.1  Complete Response (CR)

15.6 Survival Endpoints  
 
15.6.1     Overa ll Survival  
Measured as the time from Day 0 (day of stem cell infusion) to death from any 
cause.  This will be monitored annually for up to 4 years.  
During this annual visit , the following will occur  for the patients that opt to 
come here for their follow -up.  Alternatively, survival will be determined by [CONTACT_409944] : 
 Disease response/progression/relapse assessment  (the clinical 
assessment can be pe rformed up to 10 days after the laboratory 
evaluation)  
 100ml heparinized syringes and 20 mls total in green top  tubes  of 
blood will be collected from the patient for  immune monitoring 
assays.  
 Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_409910].  20ml of 
marr ow will be collected for immune monitoring.  
 
15.6.2     Progression -Free Survival  
Measured as the time from initial enrollment to progression/r elapse of disease 
or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_516989] -transplant when the absolute 
neutrophil count is > 500/mm3 for two consecutive days post -transplant (note: 
bands as well as neutrophils are included in calculations).  The fir st day on 
which this criterion is met is considered the day of neutrophil engraftment.  
 
Platelet engraftment is defined as the first of three consecutive counts post -
transplant when the platelet count is > 20,000/mm3 without platelet transfusion 
support.  The first day on which this criterion is met is considered the day of 
platelet engraftment.

 15.7.2     Failure of Engraftment  
Primary graft failure is defined as failure to recover an absolute neutrophil count 
> 500/mm3 or platelet count > 20,000/mm3 by [CONTACT_140969] y [ADDRESS_516991] -transplant.  
Secondary graft failure is defined as a fall to less than these levels for three or 
more consecutive days after Day 28 without another cause.  
 
 
 
16 Statistical Considerations  
 
Study Design  
 
This is a continuation study stemming from two previous ear ly stage clinical 
evaluations: J0115  – autologous myeloma vaccine;  and J0770  – activated MILs  
with regard to treatment effect, and tolerability of allogeneic myeloma cell 
vaccine and aMILs in this patient population . In the aMIL s trial (J0770) we have 
observed the early resul ts shown 5 out of 19  (26%) patients had complete 
response (CR) based on Blade’ Criteria. The current trial intends to build a 
treatment regime using a modified higher dose of aMIL, adoptive 
immunotherapy,  and concurrent with vaccination which had been tested in J0115 
trial to enhance overall immune anti -tumor responses. Due to alterations in ex -
vivo MILs expansion and the possibility that tumor specific vaccination could 
further augment anti -tumor immune r esponses, the study is designed to 
randomize patient onto either a high dose aMILs alone or a high dose aMILs + 
vaccine with 1:[ADDRESS_516992] initial estimation of the CR r ate for the two 
treatment  regimens in a parallel fashion,  second to the primary objective of an 
overall response assessment.  
 
16.1    Sample Size  
A total 32 evaluable patients will be needed in this clinical trial. If patients are 
registered but do not rec eive the activated T cells for any reason, then additional 
patients will be registered to ensure 32 patients are treated.  
 
The primary clinical activity is defined as completed response based on Blade’ 
Criteria. The study is designed to have initial estim ation of the CR rate among 
those treated either with aMILs alone or aMILs+ the vaccine. Our early clinical 
experience using aMILs alone shows the CR rate of 26 % compared to an 
estimated 20% CR from standard transplant. The total of 32 patients will yield a  
minimum of 40% CR rate with a lower bound of 95% confidence interval 
excess 20%. The 32 patients will be randomly assigned to either aMILs alone or 
aMILs +vaccine group with 1:1 randomization ratio stratified by [CONTACT_409945] (newly diagnosed vs rel apsed, ISS staging 1 -2 vs. 3). The sample size 
justification based on precision of estimation is tabulated below:  
 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University

16 7 44% 20%  -- 70% 
16 8 50% 25%  -- 75% 
 
The clinical efficacy is defined as complete response based on Blade’ Criteria.  
Overall complete response rate and individual treatment response rate will be 
estimated using the binomial distribution (exact method) with 95% confidence 
intervals. However, other response rates such as nCR , VGPR, PR, MR,  and a 
overall response rate (CR , VGPR, PR, MR definition see section 13.5) at [ADDRESS_516994] transplant will be calculated as proportions and reported as a 
combined response for the 32 patients and separately by [CONTACT_409946] .    
 
16.2  Statistical Analyses/ Secondary objectives  
 
Progression -free and overall survival:  
The safety endpoints will be treatment -related mortality and the incidence of 
Grade 3 hematologic toxicity. Toxicity will be graded using the NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria (Version 3.0; http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html;  see 
Appendix G). Treatment related mortality is defined as death not attributable to 
disease progression/relapse (and excluding the ‘unrelated’ and ‘not applicable’ 
categories in attribution of causality per Section 15.3) that occurs within the 
first [ADDRESS_516995] generally reported treatment related mortality in 
the 4 -8% range, [64-66]although rates as high as 14 -20% have been reported. 
[67, 68] Treatment related mortality in the current era is likely lower than these 
reported rates.  
 
The toxicity will be monitored closely.  If any patient develops Grade 4 
hematologic toxicity of 3 weeks or longer that represents greater tha n a 50% 
decrease from their post -transplant screen, the trial will be suspended until 
appropriate analysis and discussion with the FDA and IRB has been conducted.  
The study will be terminated if there are one or more deaths, which are 
definitely or probabl y attributable specifically to the activated T cell therapy, as 
defined in Section 13.3, Attribution of Causality . However, given the toxicities 
associated with high -dose therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 
attribution of death specificall y to the experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_409911]. 
Therefore the study will also be terminated and the treatment approach deemed 
not worthy of further investigation in this setting if at any time 4 patients die of 
treatment related causes or experience Grad e 3 hematologic toxicity.   
 
J0997/ NA_00029491                                                            Johns Hopkins University  
BB-IND  [ADDRESS_516996] 
observation of disease progression or death due to disease progression. Ov erall 
survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death 
due to all causes.  The Probability of progression -free survival (PFS) and overall 
survival (OS) will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and displayed 
graphically . Median PFS and OS will be reported along with 95% confidence 
intervals. Proportion of patients who were PFS and OS at specific time of 
follow -up will be reported as well.  
 
Statistical analyses of other secondary objectives such as T cell reconstitution,  
anti-tumor immune response, tumor -specific vaccine response, effect of aMIL 
on osteclastogenesis, and Myeloma clonogenic precursors will be considered 
exploratory. Descriptive statistics will be provided. All data will be summarized 
based on nature distri bution of data and presented separately by [CONTACT_409947], or by [CONTACT_409948].  
The association between clinical responses and in vitro measurements of T cell 
laboratory correlates, including T cell proliferatio n to tumor and ELISPOT 
analysis of both peripheral as well as marrow infiltrating lymphocytes will be 
explored by [CONTACT_409949].   
 
Evaluation of  hematopoietic engraftmen t: 
The mean and median time to neutrophil and pl atelet engraftment (absolute 
neutrophil count >500/mm3 and platelet >20,000/mm3) will be summarized

 1 Clinical assessment: history, review of systems,, weight, vital signs, physical exam, ECOG. For day [ADDRESS_517026] 20ml of marrow in a heparinized 60ml syringe. ( aOn day of marrow collection, patients will have 200ml of BM collected in heparinized syringes)  
3 Chemistries: sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, calcium, AST, ALT, alk. phos ph., total protein, albumin.  CBC differential will only be performed if total WBC >100/ul.  Labs may be drawn ± 24hrs.   
 4 M-protein, serum: serum protein electropheresis & immunofixation, Serum free light assay, quantitative immunoglobulins   
 5 M-protein, urine: 24 hour urine collection for total protein, protein electropheresis & immunofixation (should be obtained eith er with pre -transplant vaccine or at time of bone marrow collection)     
6 Bone Turnover to include: Blood for C telopeptide  a nd bAlkaline phosphatase in yellow top tube  
7 Myeloma Vaccine consists of 3 cell lines admixed, irradiated and administered over 3 limbs.  Pre -transplant vaccine to be administered 14 days (± 2 days)  
prior  to the bone marrow collection.   
 8 100ml of blood in heparinized syringes and 10 ml in tiger top tube will be collected at the time of bone marrow collection.   b  Vaccine Arm:  Blood will be collected  immediately before pre-transplant vaccination as well as at the time of the bone marrow  collection.  
 c  Vaccine Arm: 10 ml tiger top tube collected  2 days later.  
9  20ml of blood in green top tubes will be obtained for evaluation of myeloma precursors. d Vaccine Arm: This blood can be collected either immediately before pre -transplant vaccine or at time of bone marrow collection)       
[ADDRESS_517027] stem cell transplant toxicities will not be captured . 
12  The day 300 visit will only apply to the patients randomized to the vaccine arm. This will include a CBC with differentia l.                                                                                      
 * For aMILs infusion, patients must have T<38.5oC and room air O2 saturation of >90%.

Drugs (PWID) living with HIV at Syringe Services Program (SSP) 
 
2) Objectives* 
 
Aim 1:  To evaluate/assess the effectiveness and feasibility of same -day rapid initiation of 
ART for PWID living with HIV who utilize the SSP (SSP Rapid Initiation) .   
Aim 2: T o identify barriers to success of HIV care retention and treatment adherence among 
PWID preparing for entry into long-term HIV care.   
Aim 3 :  To compare adherence of patients in SSP Rapid Initiation after transition to a 
traditional healthcare clinic. 
 
3) Background* 
 
PWID experience extensive barriers to engagement in HIV care.  Challenges in linkage 
to care, retention in care, and viral suppression in PWID are well documented, with estimates that less than half of PWID living with HIV in the U.S. are virally 
suppressed
5,6. In the 2018 Miami outbreak investigation and public health response in 
PWID, we were able to support 100% of newly infected individuals in achieving viral suppression through a test -and-treat approach with intensive patient navigation and 
medication management; but faced challenges in initiating ART in previously diagnosed PWID, with only 53% achieving suppression. 
Reasons for this sub-optimal result could 
include  recognized barriers to HIV care and retention within the Miami community, including 
drug use, mental illness, stigma and transportation issues7,8. Although Miller et al.[ADDRESS_871701] and Treat?  Early HIV diagnosis and immediate ART initiation are essential to 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_650031], reduce the impact of outbreaks, and improve quality of life among PWID
10,11,12. Established Test and Treat paradigms have shown decreased time to virologic 
suppression, the ultimate goal of controlling HIV transmission among PWID and their sexual partners
13. However, traditional healthcare systems may not be the ideal environment to 
initiate HIV care in PWID, a population so stigmatized by [CONTACT_650046]-large that they often avoid care due to profound distrust and structural barriers. ART 
initiation at an SSP is potentially an ideal venue, bringing services to the patient and making healthcare easily accessible.  With SSPs  just beginning in [LOCATION_012], an SSP Rapid Initiation 
approach developed at the Miami IDEA SSP will enable new programs to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_650032].   
 
 
4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*  
1) Adult (age>18 years); 2) positive rapid HIV test; 3) ability to provide informed consent; 4) HIV RNA > 200 ; 5) creatinine clearance > 30 as measured by [CONTACT_89408]; 6) no 
allergy to bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BFTAF)  as indicated by 
[CONTACT_650047] -reported allergies. Any other comorbidities that at the discretion 
of the investigator would prevent the participant from participating in the study . 
 
IRB Study Number: 20200793 
 Page 3 of 10  Revised: 4/25/22  5) Study Design 
 
We plan to utilize a hybrid quasi -experimental design to test the effectiveness and 
implementation outcomes of successful delivery of rapid ART initiation intervention in an SSP (Figure 1). In addition, we will use a multi-method approach, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data on patients (n=50) accepting the rapid ART initiation protocol at the SSP, patients 
declining to engage in the rapid ART initiation protocol, and patients after transition to a traditional Ryan White clinic. To assess the effectiveness of the SSP Rapid Initiation, we will 
compare the percentage of PWID virally suppressed at [ADDRESS_871702] transition to UM/Jackson Adult Outpatient HIV Clinic. Since this proposed study is in its pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731], this study will not be exam ining differential effects in 
treatment groups in the study, but rather provide preliminary data to support a future randomized-controlled trial. Represented in the figure below, participants at the SSP will be tested for HIV 
using a rapid test, which when reactive will be confirmed using a second rapid HIV test from 
another manufacturer following a CDC -approved dual rapid HIV testing algorithm. If a patient 
tests positive, the patient will be offered immediate initiation onto ART at the SSP. Baseline labs ([ADDRESS_871703], HIV viral load, CD4, HIV genotype, CBC, CMP, 
Gonorrhea/Chlamydia, RPR, HCV Antibody, HCV RNA, HbsAg, HBsAb, HAV Total) will be 
obtained and sent to the Miami -Dade County Health Department. Patients will have up to [ADDRESS_871704] to start on ART (per definition of rapid ART initiation). The community 
advisory board and peer navigators at the SSP will assist in the SSP Rapid Initiation protocol 
design, execution, and process improvement.  Peers will work between the SSP and the Ryan White clinics.  Our experience with the 2018 HIV cluster in PWID in Miami taught us that medication management (i.e., pi[INVESTIGATOR_650033], third party pi[INVESTIGATOR_650034], weekly medication drops to participants unable to access medications at the fixed site) was 
highly effective at supporting adherence in PWID living with HIV.   Peer navigators will conduct outreach to SSP Rapid Initiation participants, monitor appointments, and provide transport to 
healthcare services. This intensive linkage and active follow-up delivered by [CONTACT_650048].  Peers will be tasked with helpi[INVESTIGATOR_650035] (e.g., Ryan White, Medicaid) and ADAP enrollment when they 
transition to the transitional HIV clinic.  This grant will enable them to have ongoing support in 
clinic after transition to the traditional healthcare environment for l ong-term care.  
Patients who decline engagement in ART after one week will be asked to partake in 
semi -structured interviews. Patients who accept will be initiated onto ART at the SSP. A 
medication adherence plan will be developed for each patient by [CONTACT_650049]. Quantitative and qualitative assessments exploring barriers and facilitators of HIV treatment adherence will be given at 1, 3, [ADDRESS_871705] treatment start date to assess viral suppression.

Quantitative Assessments of those accepting rapid ART  
Baseline assessment of participants will include socio -demographics, drug and sexual risk 
behaviors, HIV knowledge, and SSP utilization. If re-engaging: date of HIV diagnosis, previous 
HIV clinic attendance, previous ART exposure, and reason(s) for discontinuing ART. Follow -up 
assessments will include a side effect inventory, mental health screening, timeline follow-back on ART adherence, timeline follow-back on drug use.  
Qualitative Assessment of those accepting rapid ART  
Qualitative assessments will include patient perspectives on HIV diagnosis and living with HIV, including both HIV and PWID stigma. The interviews will explore which symptoms are most important to the patient, their experience with ART in the past and expe rience on BFTAF in the 
current study, and facilitators and barriers to ART adherence in the past and in the current study.  These assessments will also include formative feedback on ART initiation at the SSP, medication 
management at the SSP, follow -up HIV  care at the SSP, and barriers and facilitators to transition 
to a more traditional HIV clinic for long -term care. Those who are eligible for the study will be 
consented and asked to participate in a 30 -minute interview conducted at the IDEA SSP for 
which they will receive $ [ADDRESS_871706] result. Inclusion 
criteria are: 1) 18 years of age or older; 2) enrolled in the IDEA SSP; 3) HIV positive rapid test result; 4) English or Spanish speaking, 5) declined rapid ART initiation at the SSP. Those who are eligible for the study will be  consented and asked to participate in a 30 -minute interview 
conducted at the IDEA SSP for which they will receive $ 25.  
     These semi -structured interviews will explore: 1) the role of key personal and structural 
barriers to engagement in HIV care (e.g., transportation, poverty, and stigma); 2) perceived benefit of engaging in rapid initiation of HIV care on personal heal th outcomes (i.e., viral 

IRB Study Number:  20200793

previous ART side effects), 4) recommendations for structuring the intervention to maximize 
participant engagement (e.g., physical location, hours of opera tion, duration, and frequency); 5) 
recommendations for intervention facilitator demographics and training; and 6) current 
knowledge, attitudes, and awareness regarding HIV treatment in PWID. All interviews will be 
audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by [CONTACT_650050].  
 
 
6) Arms and Interventions  
This single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_650037] (fixed site or mobile exchange on outreach). The study is [ADDRESS_871707] ed at at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months  as outlined above. The intervention is 
delivery of HIV care outside of a traditional healthcare clinic. The medication offered will be 
BFTAF, 50/200/25mg tablet to be administered orally. The intervention will include wraparound 
support by [CONTACT_650051]. Study visits will be conducted either at the IDEA Exchange fixed 
location, or on the mobile unit in the community (e.g. homeless encampments). The fixed site and 
mobile unit are equipped with private rooms for medical encounters. Medical visit with a 
provider and phlebotomy will be provided on site.

 Page 7 of 10  Revised: 4/25/[ADDRESS_871714] that ongoing, peer -driven patient navigation based at the 
SSP will result in patients’ remaining virally suppressed after transition to the UM/Jackson Adult Outpatient HIV Clinic. More importantly, based on the hybrid des ign, this study will 
lay the foundational groundwork to provide a proof of concept for HIV care at SSPs, including pertinent implementation information for future expansion sites in the state of [LOCATION_012]. We expect to uncover barriers and facilitators to im plementation of rapid ART 
initiation at an SSP, including patient-level perspectives on improving delivery of care 
developed in the SSP Rapid Initiation among PWID  Living with HIV protocol . 
 
Secondary outcomes: Time to viral suppression, or viral suppression at 1 month, will be assessed. Treatment adherence will be assessed both by [CONTACT_6492]-up viral load results (1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months) as well as by [CONTACT_650054] (e.g., PWID accessing meds 
weekly, pi[INVESTIGATOR_650039]) and attendance at clinic visits. Successful transition to 
HIV care at a Ryan White clinic will also be assessed.  The clinic-based peer patient navigator will assist in transition of patients to long -term car e within six months of ART 
initiation. Ryan White clinic appointment attendance and successful re-enrollment in Ryan White/ADAP will be assessed.  
 
 
9) Data and Specimen Banking*  
 For clinical data, we will use the UHealth’s electronic health record, UChart, which is locked under dual authentication.  
 All data collected will be housed in the REDCap database system , which is locked under dual 
authentication by [CONTACT_650055].  Only study staff will have access to survey results.  
 
As for the in -depth interviews, sessions will be audio -recorded, transcribed by [CONTACT_650056], de -identified for analysis and stored on a password -protected computer in a secured 
office in the Don Soffer Clinical Research Center. Only study staff will have access to results.  
 
10) Data Management*  
 
Quantitative Data Analysis:  Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics 
and frequencies to present pi[INVESTIGATOR_650040]. Data will be 
presented as frequency tables, and viral suppression will be reported as a percentage suppressed at each t ime-point (1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months). All quantitative data will be stored 
and managed in REDCap and all analyses will be performed using SAS statistical 
software (Version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Categorical data will be analyzed using 
frequency of res ponses and continuous variables will be analyzed using means and 
standard deviations.  
 
Qualitative Data Analysis : Qualitative data collected from the in -depth interviews will be 
analyzed using general inductive methodology31, which allows for themes to be 
developed from the raw data based on a study objective/research question. A data codebook will be generated in an iterative process during transcript reading by [CONTACT_3476]. All qualitative data analysis will be conducted  using Dedoose (version 8.2.14, 
Sociocultural Research Consultants, Los Angeles, CA), a cross-platform software used for analyzing qualitative and mixed methods research.

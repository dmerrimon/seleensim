Protocol Title  
 Tough Talks - Virtual Support for Difficult Conversations: Using Artificial 
Intelligence to Increase HIV Disclosure Among Young Men Who Have Sex With 
Men  
Design  
 This study includes 2 phases:  
Phase 1: a technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_146310]; 
and  
Phase 2: a three-arm RCT to evaluate efficacy and effectiveness of Tough Talks 
among HIV -positive YMSM.  
Intervention 
Description Tough Talks is a n application (app) for smart phones or tablets for young men 
living with HIV to learn about and practice HIV disclosure in a safe space.   
Tough Talks  helps young men living with HIV to think about and practice 
disclosing . The app includes four sections (Und erstanding disclosure; Should I 
disclose? How do I disclose?; Preparing for the outcome) with information 
about disclosure, activities to  encourage YMSM to  think about their  own 
disclosure values and style,  choose your own adventure style games,  and 
virtua l reality scenarios for them  to practice disclosing their status safely.  
Protocol Duration  24 weeks  for Phase 2  
Sample Size  
 We will recruit approximately 210 YMSM  (8-16 in Phase 1 ; 198 in Phase 2) 
across 6 study sites (Chapel Hill, NC; Houston, TX; Tampa, FL ; Bronx, NY; 
Atlanta, GA; Charlotte, NC ) that have extensive experience engaging, enrolling 
and retaining HIV -positive YMSM.  For Phase 2, we will also recruit and enroll 
YMSM nationwide to participate remotely .  
Population  1) age 16 -29 years; 2) assigned male sex at birth; 3) male -identified ; 4) HIV 
positive; 5) owns and has reliable access to a mobile device (smartphone) or 
tablet; 6) able to understand, read, and speak English; 7) reports  ≥[ADDRESS_167570] 6 months  OR reports a  sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis in the last six months ; 8) For RCT only: 
have a viral load measurement within  12 months  prior to  enrollment (or on 
day on enrol lment) . As this is a minimal risk study, we will use a waiver of 
parental consent for YMSM under age 18. 
Data Collection  During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146311], YMSM will complete computer -assisted 
self-interviews (CASI). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_146312] a sub-set of RCT intervention 
participants will complete a post-intervention qualitative interview.  During the 
RCT, data will also be collected via chart review.  Audio record ers will be used 
to record the content of the discussions during the qualitative interviews.

IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167573] sex with men (MSM) account for nearly two-thirds all of new HIV diagnoses  in the United 
States (US) and young MSM (YMSM) continue to be disproportionately affected1. Among youth  living 
with HIV , [ADDRESS_167574]-time sex partners2. Disclosing of one’s HIV status 
is important for accessing support which can lead to improved medication adherence and retention in 
care. Those who disclose are more likely to use condoms with HIV-negative  sex partners3 and 
mathematical modeling estimates that increased HIV status disclosure to sex partners may reduce 
transmissions by 40-60%4,5. Further, disclosure may motivate HIV -negative sex partners to seek testing 
and reduce their own HIV transmission behaviors. Given the potential benefits and challenges 
associated with disclosure, there is a need for sophisticated interventions that can assist MSM with the 
disclosure process. Virtual reality provides a unique environment for users to prac tice HIV disclosure. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) driven disclosure may offer advantages over in-person role play through the use of realistic avatars that represent potential romantic partners, and probabilistic settings where users envision having disclosure conversations. Users have the opportunity to practice disclosing and 
experience a variety of responses and outcomes. During Phase I of this project we developed an iPad -
based virtual reality system that features three avatars, two virtual locations an d three disclosure 
scenarios which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by 
[CONTACT_146327]
6. In Phase II, we will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full -feature automated version 
to test via a multi -site, r andomized controlled trial (RCT) . 
1.2. Rationale  
HIV status disclosure is a stressor in the lives of many HIV -positive persons7. Failure to disclose HIV 
status can negatively impact health, impeding adherence to care or medications and hindering reduction of sexual ris k behaviors
8,9. Moreover, individuals who fail to disclose miss the positive effects of post -
disclosure support9,10. Disclosure to sexual partners, friends, and family can lead to social support, closer 
relationships, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, adherence, and improved psychological well -
being9,11. Notably, one study of  373 HIV -positive patients in Seattle found an independent association 
between disclosure of HIV and increased CD4 T- cell counts over time12. A study by [CONTACT_146328]. 
found that among 538 sexually active HIV+ MSM, engaging in sex without a condom with undisclosed 
non-concordant partners was associated with worse ART adherence and greater likelihood of unsuppressed HIV
13. 
Among MSM, many studies have found that disclosure of HIV status leads to a reduction in sexual 
risk14,[ADDRESS_167575] data show that individuals who can communicate with sex 
partners about sexual health topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], including disclosure of HIV status, a re more likely to engage in 
condom use behaviors14-17. Furthermore, disclosure may motivate sex partners to seek HIV testing and 
reduce their own HIV transmission b ehaviors, as well as influence other risk -reduction strategies such as 
strategic positioning (choosing insertive or receptive anal intercourse based on serostatus), serosorting (limiting sexual partners to those of the same serostatus) and the use of pre-e xposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP)

IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167576] the potential to be customizable to the unique participant based on user input.  
Virtual Reality (VR) has great potential as an educational tool by [CONTACT_146329] a safe, situated learning space where they can learn -by-doing and problem solve in a realistic environment that enables 
the transfer of skills learned in VR into real life
22-24. VR allows participants to practice disclosing to 
realistic virtual characters that represent pote ntial romantic partners, as well as in realistic settings. 
Participants have the opportunity to practice disclosing using a variety of strategies and experience different outcomes including acceptance, confusion, lack of HIV knowledge, and rejection.  
VR is a technological tool that can be used to enhance learning by [CONTACT_146330]. It provides several key advantages 
over current methods of delivering HIV prevention int erventions, such as role -play and video vignettes
25. 
Specifically, the sensory-rich , immersive environments of VR (virtual characters, visual ambience, 
directional audio, culturally specific content) provide a realistic avenue for YMSM for mental rehearsal 
and performance of HIV disclosure behaviors in a controlled environment where new challenges can be gradually introduced. Further, VR environments provide a standardized setting that can be controlled 
and replicated to deliver the intervent ion in a systematic manner. Additionally, incorporating 
interactivity and game mechanics (e.g. customizable virtual characters, virtual conversations) is highly 
innovative and will provide participants with a compelling, engaging experience that will motiv ate and 
support behavior change.  
Scientific Premise: Disclosure impacts adherence in care, viral suppression, HIV transmission and mental 
and physical health. There are no stand -alone sexual partner disclosure interventions, much less any 
that can be delivered wholly online. Tough Talks , a VR HIV disclosur e intervention, shows the potential 
for theoretically backed VR interventions to work as a tool to build self -efficacy. A similar strategy could 
be applied to other topi[INVESTIGATOR_146313]’s health and wellbeing - from coming out about 
one’s sexual or gender identity, to training doctors to improve delivery of difficult diagnoses, and to 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_146314] a variety of medical conditions.

Module  Description  List of Activities  
Understanding 
Disclosure  Participants go through activities that set up 
what it means to disclose your HIV status, while reminding them that they are not defined by [CONTACT_146331] a choice.  Activities in this module include 
exercises about disclosure laws across the 
country , thinking about different situations 
in which you may have to disclose or not (to 
an employer? To a roommate? To a sex 
partner? Etc .), and a mock texting activity • Choose your own adventure: It’s

Should I 
disclose? Participants are led through a series of 
activities that model different ways to think 
about and decide if they  want to disclose to 
someone. Activities in this module include 
reviewing a list of items and as signing them 
as pros or cons of disclosing , and thinking 
about the right time and place to disclose. • Choose your own adventure:

How do I 
disclose? Participants are presented with different 
ways to disclose to someone and 
encouraged to think about what ways feel 
best to them.  Activities in this module 
include reviewing different ways to go about disclosure, and what disclosure can look like depending on what feels right to the participant.  • Choose your own adventure: He

them think about the outcome after 
disclosure, from receiving s upport, to how 
to handle a poor reaction. Participants are 
reminded that they aren’t responsible for how others respond. Activities in this 
module include reviewing a list of 
commonly asked questions and answers (ex. 
Is there anything I can do to protect myself? What does undetectable mean?) and thinking about what they feel comfortable answering.  • Choose your own adventure:

2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES   
2.1 Primary Outcome  
The primary  outcome is  viral load (VL) suppression. Viral load suppression will either be obtained by 
[CONTACT_14716], or drawn for the study. Viral load suppression will be defined as HIV RNA < the lower limit 
of detection as per the laboratory processing the sample.  
2.2  Secondary Outcomes

 We will also assess intervention efficacy on a panel of self -reported outcomes including condomless anal 
intercourse (CAI), STI infections, and disclosure behaviors, intentions and self -efficacy. For binary 
outcomes, we define intervention efficacy as a di fference in proportions, while for continuous 
outcomes, we define efficacy as a difference in means . (See T able 2 on page 45) 
2.2.[ADDRESS_167577] information on (1) time  spent by [CONTACT_146332]; (2) time participants spend in 
the clinic sessions; and (3) costs associated with the deliv ery of both home and clinic arms.  The 
procedures we will use to quantify the resources required to deliver the interventions will be organized 
in standard expenditure categories: personnel, supplies, equipment, services, space, and overhead.  
Incremental cost effectiveness ratio between the 2 intervention arms will be defined as ΔC/ΔE, where 
ΔC denotes the estimated difference in mean costs of the intervention and ΔE reflects the estimated difference in mean effectiveness of proportion suppressed between the interventions.  
2.[ADDRESS_167578] the following hypotheses:  
A. Participants in both intervention arms will be more likely to be virally suppressed at 6 months 
compared to participants in the SOC arm.  
B. Participants in b oth intervention arms will report less CAI with potentially susceptible partners 
at six  months compared to participants in the SOC arm.  
C. Participants in Arm 2 ( clinic) will report greater intervention satisfaction and immersion but Arm 
2 will be costlier. 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
This study includes 2 phases:  
1) A technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_146315] ; and  
2) A three -arm RCT to evaluate efficacy and effectiveness of Tough Talks among HIV -positive 
YMSM.  
3.1  Study Population 
The total study sample is approximately 210 YMSM, of which the following will be enrolled for each 
phase: 1 ) a technical p ilot will be conducted with 8 -16 HIV+ YMSM in North Carolina; 2 ) and an RCT will 
be conducted with 198 HIV+ Y MSM by [CONTACT_60656]  6 study sites ( Houston, TX; Bronx, NY; Tampa, FL , 
Chapel Hill, NC ; Atlanta, GA; Charlotte, NC).  For the RCT phase, participants may also be enrolled 
remotely from any state in the [LOCATION_002].

 3.2  Sample Size  
We will recruit approximately 210 YMSM (8 -16 in Phase 1; 198 in Phase 2) .  To ensure inclusion of 
diverse youth who are representative of the US epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] , we will attempt to oversample YMSM of 
color, with a goal of enrolling two -thirds of the cohort YMSM of color.  
3.3 Study Randomization, Stratification, or Description of Non -Random Assignment 
Procedures  
 
Technical Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]:  Participants will be recruited from UNC -Chapel Hill. We will enroll 8 -16 participants. 
After participants are consented, they will complete a web- based computer assisted survey instrument 
(CASI) using Qualtrics software. Participants will be randomized to either use Modules [ADDRESS_167579] survey. They will rec eive $[ADDRESS_167580]: Participants will be recruited from across the country . We will enroll a total of 198 participants. 
After participants are consented, they will complete a baseline web-based computer assisted survey 
instrument (CASI) survey using Qualtrics software and be randomized  in a 1:1:1  fashion into one of three 
arms: 1) the Tough Talks fully-online intervention, 2) the Tough Talks clinic- based intervention or 3) the 
SOC control condition , based on a randomization sequence developed by [CONTACT_146333]. The randomization sequence will be stratified by  [CONTACT_3885] . Participants may enroll in -

As this is a minimal risk study, we will seek a waiver of parental consent for YMSM under age 18 (see 
Human Subjects section).  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion Criteria for All Aims:  
• Under 16 years of age  
• Over 29 years of age  
• Assigned female at birth  
• HIV negative  
• Reports [ADDRESS_167583] 6 month AND reports no new STI 
diagnosis (urethral/rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia or syphilis) in last 6 months.  
• Currently enrolled in another HIV  behavioral intervention stud y; previous or future enrollment 
in an other HIV behavioral intervention study is permissible, as is participation in any standard of 
care intervention(s) within the clinic al study site .  
4.3 Recruitment  
We will recruit approximately 210 YMSM (8-16 in Phase 2; 198 in Phase 3) across six in-person study 
sites that have extensive experience engaging, enrolling and retaining HIV -positive  YMSM. Participants 
will be recruited through a variety of strategies, in cluding online and via social media strategies (e.g. 
Craigslist, Grindr and Facebook ads); distributing posters, flyers, and palm cards about the study; and direct outreach at local venues frequented by [CONTACT_146327], including community -based organizations  and 
clinics providing care and services to HIV -positive youth. YMSM  will also be recruited to participate 
remotely; site staff will enroll people from anywhere in the country to complete all study procedures online.   
For the RCT, w e will also follow respondent- driven sampling (RDS) methods and use a long- chain referral 
method to supplement recruitment, especially with the adolescents (15-17) who may be harder to reach 
than young adults (18 -24).   
4.4  Informed Consent

 Informed consent/assent : Individuals interested in screening for study participation will be 
consented/assented for screening after reading information about the study and screening procedures. 
Those who meet initial eligibility criteria and schedule an enrollment  visit will undergo a detailed 
informed consent/assent process where  study staff will explain all study procedures and answer 
questions concerning the study and consent/assent process. The research staff member will give the participant as much time as needed and will address any questions or concerns they may have. The 
research staff member will ask the participant questions to gauge comprehension. The consent/assent 
form describes all study procedures, including confidentiality and privacy ; information  about potential 
risks, discomforts, and benefits of participation; a section on HIPPA consent for medical chart 
abstraction ; and information regarding who they can contact [CONTACT_112488]. It also states that 
participation is voluntary, that participants may decide to not take part or to withdraw from the study at 
any time without penalty or loss of any benefit to which they might otherwise be entitled, and that 
study participation is in no way related to being able to access or continue getting car e or services at any 
participating study site. Participants can refuse to answer any question and can withdraw from the study 
at any time. The PIs, Co -PIs, or designee at each site will review all informed consents and assents.   
 Assessing for decisional capacity : Study staff will review the informed consent/assent to make a formal 
assessment of the youth’s decisional capacity and ability to provide consent/assent prior to signing, using a [ADDRESS_167584], the study staff  determines if the person understands the study goals by 
[CONTACT_7939] “Can you tell me what this study is about?” In step 2, potential participants will be asked 
questions designed to assess their capacity to understand, appreciate, reason with, and express a choice 
about participation in o ur specific protocol. We will use a modified version of the widely used Evaluation 
to Sign Consent Form in which participants are asked to: 1) name [CONTACT_146370]; 2)  explain what they would do if they no longer wished to participate in the study ; 3) 
explain what they would do if they experienced distress during the study; and 4) identify potential risks 
for participating in the study. Potential participants will be enrolled only if they are able to provide clear 
and correct answers to each of these items, without prompting or correction. If the enrollment process 
occurs online, research staff will talk with potential participants via phone  or HIPAA compliant video 
teleconferencing to assess for decisional capacity and to address any questions or concerns the person 
may have.  
 
Waiver of parental consent :  W
 e will request that the UNC -CH IRB as the central IRB (IRB of Record) 
grant a waiver of parental consent  to participate in this research study for youth participants who are 16 
to 17 years of age. The research team has been granted waivers of parental permission for prior studies 
with sexual minority youth. Under 45 CFR 46.408 (c), an IRB has the authority to waive parental 
permiss ion if it determines that “a research protocol is designed for conditions or a subject population 
for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects” and 
“an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children w ho will participate as research subjects is 
substituted” and “that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, State, or local law.” A waiver of parental permission for studies with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBT) youth

 that do  not involve greater than minimal risk is a common practice among researchers working in the 
area of gay and lesbian health/mental health. This is done to avoid the selection biases operating in only 
recruiting youth whose parents are both aware of and comfortable with their sexual orientation. Commonly these youth have explored their sexual orientation without their parents’ knowledge as the 
youth struggle with issues of disclosure and its consequences within the social, religious, and economic 
context of their families. A requirement for parental permission in this type of study could not only 
affect a person’s willingness to participate, but could also potentially impact the ability of researchers to engage in this type of research with sexual minority yo uth. Additionally, minors can often seek sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) and HIV prevention services without parental/legal guardian permission, 
depending on each site’s state laws.  
 
If the purpose of requiring parental permission as stated in CFR is to protect the minor subject, then 
requiring parental permission for youth in these circumstances is not a reasonable requirement.  
Additional privacy protections are provided in that all assessments, notes, reports, and other records will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] a coded number to maintain participant confidentiality. These records and any 
forms that do contain identifying information will be kept in a locked, limited access area (such as a 
locked file cabinet) at the participating site. A waiver of signed consent will be requested from UNC -CH 
IRB.  
Once all eligibility is confirmed, study details will be discussed, and questions answered during the informed consent process. Informed consent/a ssent will be obtained before any study-related 
procedures are performed  
For the technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], consent/assent may be obtained up to 30 days prior to or on the day of 
enrollment , prior to implementing any study activities. If more than 30 days has elapsed, consent/assent 
must be reaffirmed on the day of enrollment.  
For the RCT, consent/assent must be obtained on the day of enrollment , p rior to implementing any 
study activities.

will receive $[ADDRESS_167587] 
We will enroll a total of 198 participants. Study staff will review the consent in person or over Zoom (or 
another HIPPA compliant system) and if the participant decides to enroll, he can sign the paper copy or electronic copy programmed in Qualtrics. After participants are consented, they will complete the 
baseline web -based CASI survey using Qualtrics software and  then  be randomized into the Tough Talks 
online/at -home intervention (Arm 1) , the Tough Talks clinic- based intervention (Arm 2) or the SOC 
control condition  (Arm 3) .  At this visit , those randomized to the online intervention (Arm 1) will 
download the Tough Talks app onto their personal mobile phone or tablet , have  their unique  App ID 
recorded by [CONTACT_464], set up their preferred email  login and password information , and receive 
information on how to contact [CONTACT_146337]. Arm [ADDRESS_167588] not 
completed the app around 2 weeks after enrollment, around 3 weeks after enrollment, and during week 
after enrollment will be reminded via text or email via SMART to use the Tough Talks  app.     
 Those randomized to the i n-clinic condition (Arm 2)  at this visit  will download the Tough Talks app  onto 
their personal mobile phone or tablet , have  their unique  App ID recorded by [CONTACT_464], set up their 
preferred email login and password information, and immediately begin using the program. At this in-
person  or remote  visit, they will complete both Modules 1 and 2 , which include s completion of four  
virtual reality  practice  scenarios . These scenarios will be conducted with the assistance of research staff 
controlling the avatar responses (e. g. clinic-assisted sessions) . For the remote visits, staff will do this 
privately while on video teleconference . During the in -person visits, the staff would control the avatar 
responses from a separate room. After completion of both Modules [ADDRESS_167589] of national resources for mental health

their follow -up visit , participants will complete the second half of the program  (Modules 3 and 4) , which 
also includes completion of the virtual reality practice scenarios  as described above (clinic-assisted 
sessions). Research staff will also be  available to troubleshoot with participants  in person or for the 
remote visits they will be on video teleconference  and available  via text if need be.  
Those randomized to the  SOC control arm (Arm 3) a t this visit will receive a n informational,  paper  or 
electronic packet of information on disclosure based on available CDC guidance.   
Participants will be allowed to enroll in -pe

compliant system . All participants who enroll remotely will be asked to download the necessary app to 
aid the enrollment process. They will receive all forms via text or email. Participants who enroll from 
across the country (in states where there are no SRVs) will be ass igned to an SRV by [CONTACT_11338]. For example, 
the Houston site staff may enroll the participants from western states, whereas the Tampa site staff may 
enroll participants from the southern states. The regional division of enrollments is subject to update

remote participants than another.   
On e month after study enrollment, all  participants will complete an online survey to assess intervention 
acceptability as well a s to assess social cognitive framework (SCT) model constructs related to 
disclosure. Three months after study enrollment, all participants will complete a second online survey. 
Study staff will perform a chart abstraction to record any VL measures in the s ix weeks prior to  the 
three -month study visit , or any measures since BL. Six months after study enrollment , all participants 
will complete a third  online survey. Study staff will perform a chart abstraction to record any VL 
measures  since the [ADDRESS_167590]  (2 months  prior to 6-month mark, or 3 months  
after) , participants will be asked to have blood drawn  to ascertain a VL measure as part of the study.   
All participants  will receive $50 after their  baseline visit, and Arm 2 participants will receive $50 for 
completing the baseline modules, and $50 for attending their follow -up visit. A ll participants will receive 
$25 after completing the online CASI given at one month,  $25 after completing the online CASI given at 
three  months, and $50  for completing their  6-month  CASI and VL measure. All participants asked to 
attend the clinic site as part of the study will also receive a travel reimbursement based on their location 
and site standards. A subset of participants  in the intervention arms  will do a qualitative exit interview 
($50)  beginning at the one -month follow up. For participants who refer members of their social network 
to participate in the study, for each person they recruit who screens eligible and completes initial 
enrollment steps, they will receive an incentive of $10 for up to 3 referrals for a maximum of $30.  If a 
participant completes all study -related procedures,  they can earn up to between $ 200-$ 300 dollars , 
depending on the study arm; if a participant completes  all referrals in addition to study procedures, they 
can earn between $ 230-$ 330, depending on their study arm.  
5.2  Locator/Contact [CONTACT_146338] a participant has been consented and enrolled, designated site study staff will collect 
Locator/Contact I nformation from  the participant. Participants will be asked to provide a working phone 
number or valid email address through which they can be reached. Participants will also be asked to provide valid contact [CONTACT_19297] a family member and/or friend w ho can be called in the event the 
participant cannot be reached by [CONTACT_61529]. Participants will be asked if messages can be left at 
the numbers provided. Participants will  also be asked to provide their physical address and whether 
they can receive mail related to their study participation at that address. Study staff will not leave 
messages or send mail unless expressly permitted to do so by [CONTACT_2299], which also will be documented on this form. If permission is given to leave messages or send mail, site staff will assure 
participants that messages only ask the participant to contact [CONTACT_112495]. Th is information  may be 
entered directly into SMART or collected on the Locator/Contact [CONTACT_146339].

5.3  Randomization Procedures  
 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_167592]  randomization 
sequence developed by [CONTACT_11604]. The randomization sequence will be stratified by [CONTACT_3885] . 
 The randomization sequence will be setup in REDCap such that study staff may use the randomization 
featu re to determine study arm assignment for each participant. Staff will not be aware of the 
randomization sequence, and therefore will not know what preceding or subsequent assignments will be.  
 5.4  Intervention/Investigation Procedures  
5.4.2 Technical Pil ot  
After development is complete and internal beta testing performed, both the Tough Talks intervention 
and intervention procedures will be evaluated and revised during a technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_61724] a  small group of 
YMSM participants (8 -16) at one site  (Chapel Hill, NC). All participants will be given brief instructions on 
the purpose of Tough Talks and an overview of how to use the program. They will complete an online 
assessment  at baseline and a post survey after using the program. Participants will also be asked to 
provide feedback during qualitative interviews conducted by [CONTACT_146340], 
functionality, technical performance, errors and bugs encountered, overall experiences using  Tough 
Talks , and feedback for further refin ement. We will solicit feedback about the acceptability and utility, 
and assess how the intervention components could be strengthened, identifying areas needing 
improvement for future iterations. Participant feedback will be specifically sought on the subj ective 
impact of the intervention on HIV disclosure, engagement in care and ART adherence. Participant 
feedback will also be solicited on the acceptability of the assessments with respect to duration and 
relevance. Both the qualitative and quantitative dat a from the technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_146316] , the intervention protocol and the assessment tools prior to the RCT pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (Aim 3) 
using a concurrent triangulation approach, taking advantage of the strengths of both data types to cross 
validate results. [ADDRESS_167593] (Aim 3).  
5.4.[ADDRESS_167594] will occur from the 6 study sites (Tampa, FL; Houston, TX; Bronx, NY ; Chapel 
Hill, NC ; Atlanta, GA; Charlotte, NC ), as well as through online channels such as social media . Identifying, 
screening and enrolling potential participants for the RCT will proceed as descr ibed in sections 4.3, 4.4, 
4.5, and 5.1. After eligibility is confirmed, and consent/assent is obtained , participants will be assigned a 
study ID, complete the baseline  CASI survey , and then be randomized to a study arm. Next, participants 
will be walked through  a brief description of their study arm ( clinic , at home, control ). Participants will 
be compensated $50 -$100  at the conclusion of the enrollment vis it (depending on arm)  and reminded 
IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167595] a combine d eff icacy/effectiveness trial  to compare the intervention 
delivered online, in the clinic or SOC  disclosure materials . Primary and secondary outcomes will be 
assessed at intervention completion ( one month) , three months,  and at six months , and will include HIV 
VL information (abstracted via chart review, shared by [CONTACT_146341], or blood draw), self-report data based o n the CASI surveys  and staff completion of costing tools and CRFs . Mathematical 
modeling will estimate transmissions  averted and costs of each arm.  
 A sub set of participants in both intervention arms will complete a qualitative exit interview to evaluate the program in-depth and document a more nuanced understand ing of intervention acceptability and 
impact. Participants in  both interventions will be eligible to participate in an interview after completion 
of their one -month follow -up survey.  The interviews will be conducted  in person or online using a 
HIPAA -compliant, IRB -approved videoconferencing software program. Online  interviews will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_146342] -up recorded using an external digital audio recorder. In -
person interviews will be recorded using two digital audio recorders.  Interviews will last [ADDRESS_167596]  original recording s. Participant s can opt to include 
video chat, but no video will be recorded. I nterviews will be semi-structured  and focus  on participants ' 
evaluation of the program (e.g. likes, dislikes , technical problems), how they used the program over the 
course of the month, what impact (if any) they perceive using  the program had or would have on them 
(probing for status dis closure, HIV  care and medication adherence, social support and sexual behavior  
choices) , and suggestions for changes to the program. We aim to interview 20 -30 participant s (10-15 in 
each arm , with approximately even distribution  across the 4 study sites). Based on previous similar study 
designs, we are confident that we can recruit a sufficient number  of interviewees from the pool of 112 
possible intervention participants ( 112 = 66 in each of the two intervention arms, less 15% attrition). 
Participants  will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_167597]  and to 
provide additional context for interpreting the intervention 's quantitative results.

assistant (RA) level position should be sufficient to verify eligibility during both study aims , obtain 
informed consent, be available for questions during the CASI,  abstract viral load  information via chart 
reviews , take a blood sample for viral load, control the AI during clinician assisted virtual reality sessions, 
and explain the Tough Talks intervention. Research staff at SRVs will be trained in person and /or via 
videoconferencing o n the intervention components  and will be given a script and checklist to review 
with participants. If a participant asks a question that study staff do not feel equipped to answer, SRV 
study staff will contact [CONTACT_146343]/or Duke 
University and then follow  up with the participant.

 5.4.5 Intervention Monitoring/Quality Control  
Because the Tough Talks intervention is an app, intervention fidelity is assured for all activities, except 
for the virtual reality activities (i.e., all participants will receive the intervention in the same way and 
have access to all of the same resource s). For the virtual reality activities, Arm [ADDRESS_167599] the avatar controlled by [CONTACT_3655]. However, for both VR activities, the same utterance database is being used so while we ant icipate that the staff 
controlled avatar may perform better, the types of conversations and specifics on what words/phrases can be said in both arms will be the same. To maintain quality control the study team will train and score practice VR scenarios and  retrain if needed prior to enrollment visits. The UNC study team will also 
review the first 10 VR session transcripts performed at each SRV site, and then 20% of the sessions on an ongoing bas is. Site staff with issues will be re -trained.

measure administration and procedures.  
6.1  Screening  
Online, phone-based,  and in-person screeners will be used to determine if individuals meet initial 
eligibility criteria. Individuals may be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_146344] ’s online screener 
using their own laptop or mobile device (e.g., if responding to  online or community recruitment) or may 
complete the online screener on a local clinic tablet or computer. The online screener may also be 
administered by [CONTACT_146345].  All potential technical 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_146317] (based on the screener) must arrange an in-person  enrollment visit to confirm eligibility .  Potentially eligible RCT participants can select an online 
visit if needed. Eligibility will be confirmed at the enrollment visit based on the confirmation of screener 
completion in past [ADDRESS_167601] year of screener complet ion (or up until the 
enrollment visit date) .

The intervention will last for 1 month. The 1 -month assessment should occur as soon after their 1 -
month enrollment period as possible. However, given that the one-month assessment is the only one 
that includes measures of overall intervention acceptability, the assessment may occur up to 160 days  
after the ideal 1-month assessment time point  (e.g. up until the end of follow -up period) . SMART will aid 
study staff in ensuring retention. SMART maintains participant follow -up timelines, tracks participant 
communications, and automates sending of e- mail, text reminders, and calendar invites to participants

7.0  DATA COLLECTION AND SITE MONITORING 
7.1  Development of Protocol and Case Report Forms  
 
The protocol team is responsible for the development of this protocol as well as the Case Report Forms 
(CRFs) needed to collect the information required to implement this protocol. All Case Report Forms are 
input in REDCap, where study staff will complete all relevant fields.   
7.2  Data Records  
 
Participant-related study information will be identified through a study ID number (SID) and participant 
code on all participant CRFs, audio files, transcripts, and CASI files. Participant names or other 
personally-identifying information will not be used on any study documents other than the Contact [CONTACT_146346] (stored in double-locked office separate from other study information only accessible by [CONTACT_68293])  and informed consent form  and will be redacted from usability and 
field trial interview transcripts. All study -related information will be kept in double-locked, limited 
access areas at each study site. Particip ant names and their SID and participant code will be stored in in 
SMART Web, accessible only to designated s tudy staff , and representatives from the NICHD. SIDs will 
not be entered into the mobile app and instead a unique app ID will be assigned to each participant and used when setting up  the app. These unique App IDs will be provided by [CONTACT_146347] .  Original source documents (e.g., 
Contact [CONTACT_146346]) for individual participants will be maintained at the respective SRV and will be accessible only to the study staff. Data from original source documents will be transcribed with SMART or on CRFs  in REDCap  as applicable. Electronic data will be stored on a secure server at UN C.

 7.3.2   CASI Survey Data  
Technical Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] : Self -administered surveys will be completed by [CONTACT_146348] 1 -month 
assessment time points. Participants will complete an online computer assisted self -interview (CASI) via 
survey hosts on Qualtrics .  
RCT: Self -administered surveys will be completed by [CONTACT_146349], 1 -month,  3-month  and 
6-month assessment time points. Participants will complete an online computer assisted self -interview 
(CASI) via survey hosts on Qualtrics.   
Data collected using a CASI method at the clinic sites will be entered on a portable computer or mobil e 
phone via an internet-based application. All data collected using CASI will remain confidential; no 
personal identifying information will be collected during the computer session.  The participant’s unique SID number  will be used in order to link the int erview responses to the participant’s CRF data. This 
unique SID will also be used to link participant completed follow -up Qualtrics  surveys  
7.3.[ADDRESS_167610] qualitative interviews remotely  and/or to enable remote enrollments . For the 
qualitative interviews, participants will have the option to conduct face -to-face video chat, video chat in 
which they can see the interviewer, but the interviewer cannot see them , or audio chat only. In order to 
ensure privacy, participants will be asked to complete the interview within a private room. Zoom is 
compatible on PCs, tablets, and smartphones; as well as maintains the option to conduct an audio 
conference without the video component.   
End-to-end encryption: Zoom encrypts all presentation content at the application layer using the 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit algorithm. Zoom end -to-end (E2E) chat encryption allows 
for a secured communication where only the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_112465]. Zoom 
uses public and private keys to encrypt the chat session with Advance Encryption Standard (AES256), and session keys are generated with device unique hardware ID to avoid data being read from other 
devi ces. This ensures that the session cannot be eavesdropped on or tampered with.  
Cloud Control Infrastructure: A distributed network of low -latency multimedia routers (software) 
resides on Zoom’s communications infrastructure. With these low -latency multimedia routers, all 
session data originating from the host’s device and arriving at the participants’ devices is dynamically switched — never stored persistently through the Zoom communications infrastructure. Zoom’s 
communications infrastructure for real -time video, audio, and data communications resides on Zoom 
dedicated servers, which are housed in SSAE 16 SOC2 compliant datacenters on opposite sides of the US. Zoom sessions are completely temporary and operate analogously to the popular mobile 
conversation over the public mobile network. In addition to unique security beneﬁts, Zoom’s

HTTPS (port 443/TLS). 
The Zoom sessions will contain identifying information,  but this information will be stripped f rom the 
recorded Zoom sessions by [CONTACT_146350].  
7.3.5 Back Up Reco rding 
All qualitative inter views may also be recorded using a back -up digital audio recorder. Audio files will be 
erased after being transcribed and transcripts will be de-identified. All audio files will be kept 
confidential and stored in a locked/limited access folder on secured servers, which is only accessible to 
designated study staff. All members of the research team will be trained in confidentiality and have 
signed confidentiality agreements. A professional transcription service, experienced in the handling of confidential da ta, will be used to fully transcribe verbatim all audio files. Prior to receipt of the first 
audio file, the transcription service will be instructed to exclude from the typed transcript identifying information (e.g., a name) that may have been verbalized during the course of the interviews.

conduct, the s tudy sites  will maintain the CRFs with in REDCap and any hard -copy CRFs will be stored in 
secured locat ions and later entered into REDCap.  
7.4.2   Audio -recorded Data  
Audio recorded data from the technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_146319] a digital file on a 
secure encrypted UNC server. Exit interviews will be transcribed verbatim from the  digital audio 
recording  and de-identified by [CONTACT_112509]. After transcripts are verified by [CONTACT_146351], audio files will be destroyed.  
All CASI data will only be identified with a unique SI D and stored on a secure encrypted server by [CONTACT_146352]. Only study site research staff and the research team at the University of North Carolina/Duke 
will have access to the data. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_167613] will be able to access and open the survey through the

 7.4.4   Retention Data  
The study will use a HIPAA -compliant web-based platform entitled Study Management and Reten tion 
Toolkit (SMART), which is a SaaS (Software as a Service) based mobile application aiding studies with 
various aspects of participant recruitment, study implementation, and retention. The application has the 
ability to securely manage participant information across multiple studies and customers 
simultaneously, stratifying participant information by [CONTACT_112512]. SMART includes an admin web 
portal and a participant facing mobile app (optional), which allows for secure messaging, study calendar 
managem ent, self -scheduling by [CONTACT_4317], secure photo uploads, and longitudinal tracking of 
participants from screening to study completion. The ability to designate specific roles to all SMART 
users allows for greater control around permissions and accessibi lity to participant information. Users 
can even be limited to a reporting only role, which allows for study oversight through real time 
aggregate reporting, but no access to PHI. SMART is a licensed service of the Center for AIDS Research 
(CFAR) at Emory U niversity, Prevention Science Core. Utilization of the mobile app is optional and the 
admin web portal will fully function without it.  
The following information outlines the security of the three SMART components: (1) the admin web 
portal, (2) the partici pant app, and (3) a web service that acts as a liaison between the mobile app and 
the study database.  
Admin Web Portal:  The admin web portal is a web -based application developed using Microsoft .NET 
technologies. It uses SQL server as backend database. The application requires two servers to host: (1) 
Web server [Windows server with IIS] and (2) SQL server [Standard or Ent erprise version]. Both these 
servers are to be placed behind a firewall. Web server will have a public IP to access the server using 
VPN. SSL certificate is to be installed on the web server. The admin website will be rendered over SSL 
(https). The application uses form authentication (no integrated authentication such as AD). All 
passwords are stored encrypted within the database. The s ystem will also be using database level 
encryption, which will prevent any copying of information from one database to ano ther. The w eb 
application also uses an automatic logout feature after a certain period of inactivity. By [CONTACT_15094], the inactivity duration is set to three minutes.  
Study staff can only first gain access to the admin web portal if granted by a study or site  administrator. 
Their assigned user role will determine their permissions to perform different actions and even view PHI. 
Email notifications are sent from the system (without the need to login) when: (1) a staff member requests to reset their password, (2) role assignments to a study are made, (3) an event/visit that staff 
are scheduled to work is nearing, (4) a new task is assigned to a staff member, or (5) they are designated 
as a staff member to receive alerts of positive test results. All participant c ommunications are 
performed using secure messaging through the message center (inbox) implementation within the 
mobile app. If the mobile app is not utilized by a study, communications are sent as standard email or 
text messages to participants.  
Mobile Ap p: The mobile app, developed natively for iOS and Android platforms and available for free in 
the App Store and Google Play Store, is an optional feature the study can utilize for self -scheduling, 
IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167614] information listed in the admin web portal will be able to proceed into the app. For 
validation, the app uses both traditional form auth entication as well as social login (Facebook and 
Google). The social login feature will only work if the email associated with either social account matches the contact [CONTACT_112514]. The app does not request anything other than b asic information from these authentication services. Participants cannot “remember” their 
password on the mobile device for automatic logins to ensure privacy. All participant data and activity status is maintained within a secure and encrypted SQL Server database. To create the connection between the admin web portal and the mobile app, each participant is assigned a unique ID within the 
application, which is associated with their login credentials. When a participant has been successfully 
authenticated th rough the mobile app, the admin web portal will send their specific information to their 
phone through the established secure session (web APIs using SSL). The app will not store the 
information presented locally on the phone. Local data storage is used only for storing some minimal 
non-PHI information, such as app settings. The mobile app implements an automatic logout when there 
is inactivity for more than three minutes. If a participant should need to re-download the app on a new 
device, login and passwo rd authentication will be required again.  
The mobile app has push notifications that are primarily used for reminders and notifications of new messages. Push notifications displayed on the participant’s phone will be generic in nature and not 
contain any PHI. Reminders and notifications within the mobile app inbox will also be generic in nature, 
with any message containing sensitive information requiring a pin, established during registration as a secondary authentication, to open within the mobile app. Firebase cloud -messaging service is used as a 
communication channel for these notifications. No PHI is passed through Firebase. Push notifications are customizable in the study setup, and samples of system notifications include: “You have a new message 
in your inbox,” “You have an upcoming event for March 7, 2018,” and “You have a pending task.”  
Web Service:  A web service will also be hosted on the web server. This service is used by [CONTACT_146353]. The service will utilize secure socket layer (SSL) for 
communicatio n.

Site monitors at UN C may visit participating study sites to review a selected portion of the individual 
participant records, including assent/consent forms, CRFs, and supporting source documentation to 
ensure the protection of study subjects, compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records. Regulatory files, as required, will also be inspected to ensure that regulatory requirements 
are being followed.

8.0  PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT  
8.1    Tracking Participants / Follow -up 
 
All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_146355] w-up study visit/assessment (i.e., enrollment,  2-week visit 
for Arm 2 participants, one-month,  three -month,  and six-month time points). Multiple contact [CONTACT_146356] (e.g., mail, alternate phone numbers, e-mail, text message, Facebook).  Doximity, a HIPAA compliant app, may be used to call participants.   Subjects will 
be asked whether or not messages can be left for each of the phone numbers that they provide.  They will be informed that messages will not contain any information regarding the nature of the project.  The 
SMART participant management system will be used.  
8.2    Compensation  
 
Technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_91196] :  Compensated with $ [ADDRESS_167617] participants:   Compensated with $50 at enro llment visit,  $50 for completing baseline modules (Arm 
2 participants only), $5 0 for the 2-week visit (Arm 2 participants only),  $25 at the one-month visit, $25 at 
the 3 -month visit, and $50 at the six -month visit. Participants who do a qualitative interview will receive 
an additional $50. ($200-300 total).  Compensation will be provided in person, sent digitally  or can be

 1) B reach of Confidentiality: A potential risk to participants is violation of confidentiality. We will 
take the utmost caution to protect the con fidentiality of all responses. We will minimize this risk 
by [CONTACT_146358], field testing and 
RCT. Files – audio, paper and electronic – will not have any identifying information about the 
study participants and will be tracked through a unique SID. All audio recordings will be 
downloaded and stored on a password -protected, encrypted computer in locked offices at UNC -
CH and subsequently transferred to UNC encrypted servers.  Transcription of audio files will be 
conducted using a HIPAA -compliant transcription service. Any names mentioned in the audio 
files will be redacted during transcription. Interview transcripts will be kept on UNC secure 
servers . Analysis of transcripts will be conducted on a pa ssword -protected, encrypted computer. 
Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_146320]. This research specifically targets a vulnerable population, children (YMSM ages 16 -17). We will take every available step to minimize the risk of 
identifying/linking data being subpoenaed, stolen, or inadvertently released. First, the Tough 
Talks  has acquired a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH.. Second , the study will safeguard 
against the risk of the linking information being stolen by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_121777] a l ocked 
Excel spreadsheet on  a secure server at UNC to which only essential study personnel who have 
completed CITI certification for human subjects research ethics training ( http://citiprogram.org ) 
will have access. We have also included numerous features to ensure app security and privacy. 
All relevant app communications (e.g. those between participants or those between participants 
and staff) will be secured via industry standard encrypted SSL communications links. These connections will ensure that all co mmunications are inaccessible to unauthorized third parties. 
Furthermore, the app can be updated regularly to address any unforeseen security updates to the software libraries underlying the secured communication links . Beyond encrypting 
communication, we users will need to log in with a username [CONTACT_146371], even if the use of their phone is “unlocked”. This will allow the user to share their phone 
generally with others without granting access to Tough Talks . These software security solutions 
will provide the layers of both communications security and physical access security to ensure that only authorized users have access to the information stored on the phone as well as the 
information being shared over communications links. We will ta ke special care to ensure that 
Tough Talks addresses participant privacy. We have chosen the app name, Tough Talks , because 
it does not relate to health care and is therefore designed to be non-stigmatizing and un-
interpretable by [CONTACT_146359] a participant using the app on their mobile phones. During app onboarding, study staff will assist youth in choosing a discreet and anonymous username. 
Moreover, mobile phone screens themselves are also constructed to prevent surreptitious 
observation.  
 
2) Em
otional discomfort : It is possible that the study may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_146321]/or an 
emotional response when YMSM  answer questions about potentially sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_146322]. Further, participants may feel embarrassed about discussing sensitive issues. All participants will be told during the informed consent process that their participation is voluntary and that they can chose to stop participating at any time without any consequences. Based on our experiences using similar data collection methods with YMSM  in past studies, the likelihood 
and seriousness of this risk is minimal and we will strive to create a safe and comfortable 
environment for all study participants.

 3) Di scom fort during collection of blood specimen: The risk of discomfort due to blood sample 
collection is considered minimal. Physical harms are minimal. Blood samples will be collected 
based on best clinical practices in each of the SRV sites by [CONTACT_32341]. Subjects could experience dizziness, diaphoresis and nausea associated with the procedure but in prior clinical 
studies using blood sample collection, adverse events have been rare.  
 
All s
ites have specific policies governing the treatment of human subjects. These policies specify that 
medical and psychological assistance will be available in the immediate environment in the event a 
participant should experience any adverse reactions resulting from study procedures.  
While participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer any question at any time, responses 
or reactions to certain questions may indicate distress on the part of the participants. If at any time 
during the study a participant divulges that they are at risk for harm, including but not limited to being abused or experiencing violence, if harm is suspected or likely, or if the participant states they are 
suicidal/homicidal, measures will be taken to ensure their safety. Reporting will be done as appropriate 
to the situation and the legal statutes, including reporting to child protection agencies or other appropriate agencies, and referrals will be provided to appropriate support, coun seling, or treatment 
resources.

Subjects will be prematurely discontinued from the study if any of the following occurs:  
• The subject withdraws consent/assent;  
• The study is cancelled by [CONTACT_18121]; 
• The study is cancelled for other administrative reasons;    
• The subject becomes incarcerated or placed in detention during the study; or  
• Death of the subject.  
 
Participants may end their participation in the study at any time. No further data collection will occur 
from the date the decision is made to permanently discontinue the subject from the study. Participants who experience distress during the study while in the study site  clinic will be offered counseling on site. 
Participants who experience distress during the study and do not come to the clinical site  for a visit will 
be provided a list of community referrals via phone or e-mail. Any unexpected adverse events that meet 
the new safety information reporting criteria will be immediately reported to the UNC -CH IRB and the

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167619] follow both the UNC IRB and their own IRB’s procedure for reporting and 
managing untoward effects.  
 There are three types of untoward effects to be identified: 1) those related to the participant, 2) those related to the study staff, and 3) those related to the neighborhood/community  (if applicable).  
 
First, the study will catalogue any untoward effect related to the participant. Reporting is required for 
occurrences including social harms, psychological distress, and serious life-threatening events such as suicide attempts. These may be immediately app arent to the study staff, such as the participant’s 
emotional upset state requiring referral for counseling; or they may be delayed and reported later to study staff, such as physical harm to an individual for having participated in the study.  Study staff  will 
notify the UNC/Duke teams via secure email with a subject line stating that immediate response is necessary. Study staff will be briefed with best practices and trainings on the scope of possible untoward effects and how to report events.  
 Second, study staff may encounter untoward events during sessions that personally affect them. 
Training and guidance will seek to minimize this risk. Nonetheless, an assessment of the cost of 
conducting this study must include cataloguing these events as well. The UNC/Duke team  will be 
notified of these events so that they may be immediately addressed, evaluated, and then modify guidance or expanded to minimize similar risk to other study staff. 
 Third, a critically important area that any community -based study intends to evaluate is the impact, 
including untoward effects, of the project on the community. This will be done informally for this protocol with untoward events being reported to the protocol team.  
 All untoward effects/adverse events/unanticipated problems  will also need to be reported to the UNC 
IRB if they meet all three of the following criteria:  
“Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
1) is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
2) is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
3) Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm ) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Events that meet the criteria for an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_112470] (1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event. Any other events that 
meet the criteria for a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_29737] (2) weeks of the investigator

of care arm and each of the two intervention arms. Using data from previou s work, we estimate the 
probability of viral load suppression to be 0.66 in each of the three trial arms at baseline, and a change 
in this probability to 0.88 in each of the two intervention arms at six months of follow -up. Assuming this 
absolute change of  0.22, a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, and 15% loss to follow -up over the six-month 
study period, we estimate we will need 66 participants in each of the 3 study arms (n=1 98) to achieve 
80% power to detect this change in the probability of viral load suppression between SOC and the two 
intervention arms. While our sample size is not powered to detect a difference between the two 
intervention arms , precise estimates of the efficacy for each arm are critical for subsequent costing 
analyses.  
Power calculation s were performed using PASS v.13 software (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah).

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167623] recent viral load will be abstracted from participants’ medical records, within a specified time window (per trial eligibility criteria).  At six months, participants’ most recent viral load will 
be abstracted if one is available in the  2-month  window  prior to the six -month follow -up visit; if none is 
available within that window, a blood draw will be done for the study  to ascertain viral load , or 
participant can have viral load measure as part of normal care within three months after six -month visit . 
We will use a binomial regression model (with identity link) for the risk difference (RD) in [ADDRESS_167624] imbalances in baseline viral suppression. Additional baseline 
covariates may be included in the model  to increase the precision of treatment effects.  The treatment 
weights may be combined with censoring weights if loss to follow -up exceeds 15% or if there is evidence 
of differential censoring by [CONTACT_1570].  
All analyses will be  conducted using R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) .

model (with identity link) for the RD in any CAI with a susceptible partner (vs. none) at six months, comparing the intervention groups to the control group. Similar to viral suppression, we expect that the probability of CAI with a susceptible partner will be similar for intervention and control groups at baseline. We will use inverse probability of treatment weights to correct any imbalances in baseline CAI with a suscepti ble partner. In addition, baseline covariates may be included in the model  to improve 
precision of treatment effects.  Censoring weights may also be included if loss to follow -up exceeds 15% 
or if there is evidence of differential censoring by [CONTACT_1570].

 In addition to the main six- month CAI outcome (any CAI with a potentially susceptible partner in the last 
3 mont hs), we will conduct a separate analysis in which “potentially susceptible partner”  is defined as a 
partner who is not known to be HIV -positive or taking HIV medications (including PrEP). Additionally, we 
will compare  the intervention and control arms with  respect to the number of CAI acts in the last three 
months according to partner HIV and PrEP status  (known HIV -positive, HIV -negative and not on PrEP, 
HIV-negative and on PrEP, unknown HIV status) . Finally, linear mixed models will be fitted to all 
contin uous outcome measures  (i.e., self -regulation, self -efficacy to disclose, disclosure outcome 
expectations, consequences of disclosure, and intentions to disclose)  to estimate the relative change in 
mean response from baseline to [ADDRESS_167627], AIC and BIC criteria.  
Intervention completion and acceptability will be assessed at 1 month, and sensitivity analyses will 
evaluate how our findings for primary outcomes are influenced when we account for observed intervention completion.  
 Transmission Model  
We will use a modified Bernoulli process mathematical model
26 to estimate the expected number of 
secondary sexual HIV transmission events for study participants. The estimated number of transmissions 
expected from each participant in each three- month interval (months -3 to 0, months 1 to 3, months 4 
to 6) will be based on his  viral load, specific risk behaviors, reported numbers of partners and acts within 
those partnerships, and partner HIV/PrEP  status in that interval. In addition to the study data, we will 
review the literature to obtain model parameters for per-act HIV transmission probabilities, the effect of 
viral load and condom use on transmission probabilities, and expected HIV prevalence among partners whose HIV status was unknown. To account for uncertainty in  model input parameters, we will run 
10,000 simulations of the model, varying  the input values for parameters obtained from the literature. 
The main output of each model run is the expected number of secondary transmissions for each 
participant  over the si x months after baseline, which will be summarized as the mean value (with 95% 
credible interval) in that period across all simulations. We will compare the estimated transmission 
events for the intervention and control groups to estimate transmissions averted due to the Tough Talks 
approach . 
10.3.4. Program cost data collection  
We will use the program costing approach described by [CONTACT_146360] (2014)
[ADDRESS_167628] weights developed using the 
data collection framework provided  by [CONTACT_146360] (2014)27. We will use the individual site data 
collected by [CONTACT_146361], combined with study contract and  expenditure records to 
estimate the intervention costs and of resource use differences by [CONTACT_3148]. The Kim Excel model is a standardized instrument that is used to capture the economic cost treatment programs (e.g., personnel, 
facilities, supplies) to calculate a cost per visit or other type of service
27. Study case flow and expenditure 
data will be used to determine the average cost/subject for each service type, average cost per 
technology -related resource us ed, and overall cost of technology to be amortized over the interventions 
IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167629] of software amortization and market uptake assumptions on 
the ICERs estimated by [CONTACT_10994].  
10.3.5 Qualitative exit interviews  
Transcribed e xit interviews will be analyzed thematically for both a priori and emergent themes using 
Dedoose qualitative data analysis software  (or equivalent). We will follow similar analytic procedures 
used in Phase 1 in order to identify possible areas for program improvement in Phase 2 and to provide 
additional context for interpreting the intervention’s quantitative results.  
10.[ADDRESS_167630] step will be to assess the extent and pattern of missing data. If data are missing for 
only a few cases, then data analysis will be conducted only on study participants with complete data. However, when such a strategy would result in loss of data from a substantial proportion of participants, or if this approach would lead to biased or inaccurate results, then some form of imputation will be performed. The form of imputation used will depend on the nature of the data that are missing. For example, data that are collected repeatedly might be imputed using the “last value carried forward” 
method; and in some instances, interpolation between neighb oring points might also be used.  
When the primary endpoint is missing, one data analysis will be conducted using only cases with the 
endpoint. Subsequent analysis will be done where missing endpoints are imputed. Hot -deck imputation 
or regression imputation may also be used in this context.  
11.0   HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, and 45 CFR Part 46.  
11.1    Participants’ Confidentiality  
 
All laboratory specimens, ques tionnaires, evaluation forms, reports, transcripts, and other records will 
be identified by [CONTACT_146362], to maintain participant confidentiality. All paper records with personally -identifying information will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a limited secure access 
area at each study  site. All computer entry and networking programs will be done with coded numbers 
only. Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as necessary for mo nitoring by [CONTACT_146363]. Every effort will be made to ensure that study 
participants are protected from risks.  
 Breach of Confidentiality:  A potential risk to participants is violation of confidentiality. We will take the 
utmost caution to  protect the confidentiality of all responses. We will minimize this risk by [CONTACT_146364].  
Participants may be concerned about the security of their data, pa rticularly since it is collected and 
stored electronically. UNC and Duke have significant experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_146323] 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167631] -protected access to data. Therefore , we believe that this risk will be minimal.  
For both Tough Talks  intervention arms , participants will create a unique username [CONTACT_146372] . Participants will not be able 
to priva tely communicate with each other on the app. Trained research staff at the University of North 
Carolina will monitor the website daily to  ensure violations to privacy.   
11.2    Certificate of Confidentiality  
 
This research specifically targets a vulnerable population, children – YMSM ages 15 -17. We will take 
every available step to minimize the risk of identifying/linking data being subpoenaed, stolen, or inadvertently released. First, the Tough Talks  has secur ed a Certificate of Confidentiality from the NIH. 
Second, all research staff members are required to complete ethical clearance certification regarding protection of human subjects through their relevant IRBs. Third, all studies will have documented proced ures to safeguard against the risk of the linking information being stolen by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_146324] ( http://citipr ogram.org) will have access.  
Per Section [ADDRESS_167632]  as implemented in the 2017 NIH Certificates of 
Confidentiality Policy , all ongoing or new research funded by [CONTACT_119185] 13, 2016 that is 
collecting or using identifiable, sensitive informa tion is automatically issued a CoC.   As noted on the NIH 
website (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/COC/faqs.htm#187), a Certificate of Confidentiality will help the research team “...avoid compelled ‘involuntary disclosure’ (e.g., subpoenas) of names an d 
other identifying information about any individual who participates as a research subject (i.e., about whom the investigator maintains identifying information) during any time the Certificate is in effect.”  
11.3    Risks and Benefits  
11.3.1   Risks  
To minimize the risk of participants feeling uncomfortable about answering personal questions, we will use Computer Assisted Self Interview (CASI) methods for the study's assessments. In CASI, participants 
read assessment questions on a laptop computer or mobile phone and use a combination of mouse click 
and keyboard/touchscreen entry to input the answers themselves. Study staff may be available to assist participants with questions or technical difficulties on the CASI. Participants will also be able to refuse  to 
answer any question that makes them uncomfortable. In -depth interviews will be conducted face -to-
face or online.  
To minimize risks to confidentiality, we will secure study data with all appropriate physical, electronic and operational protections. Data will be stored in a physically secure environment. All data files will have encryption and strong password protection. Any identifiable data will either be stored on UNC secure servers or will be on fully encrypted laptops. CASI assessments and online eligibility screening will 
take place on  Qualtrics . Access to data will be on a role-based standard; only those study staff who 
require access to each type of data to complete their study-related roles will be allowed access. All study 
staff will be trained in security and confidentiality procedures, and will sign a confidentiality agreement before receiving access to any participant data.  
IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0  
PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_146307]-Weidman  5/13/[ADDRESS_167633] a non- specific message about participation in a health study. No study -related 
messages will ever mention HIV prevention or the nature of the research study.  
We use SSL encryption for transfers of information online, and Qualtrics has a business partner HIPAA 
agreement with UNC . Qualtrics is  HIPA A compliant.  
UNC  will use Dedoose software to perform all qualitative analyses. Dedoose is a web-based application 
for organizing and analyzing textual, audio, and video data (qualitative) along with outstanding 
functionality for their integration with su rvey, test score, ratings, and demographic data (quantitative). 
Dedoose employs the highest levels of data encryption available for a web application in all data 
storage, back up, and transmission. Dedoose allows for project specific encryption feature.  
In addition to a Certificate of Confidentiality, we will protect participants in the following ways (which 
correspond to the potential risks described in A.3):  
 
1) B
reach of confidentiality. We will take every precaution to minimize risks to study participants . 
All research staff members are required to complete ethical clearance certification regarding protection of human subjects through UNC -CH and Duke University or at their participating 
study  site. We also have a strong data and safety monitoring plan in p lace to protect 
participants. Adverse events will be reported to the UNC -CH and Duke University and study  site-
specific IRBs using the Adverse Event Reporting Forms. Reports will be sent within [ADDRESS_167634] completed training and received certification in Human Subjects  
Research Prote ction (CITI Program) and HIPAA regulations. They will continue to renew this 
training in compliance with institutional policies. Participants will be asked to provide informed written consent to audio recording (usability testing, field testing) and HIV testing, and medical 
chart abstraction. To assure confidentiality and protection of the participants during audio recording, all files and transcripts will be stored on a password protected, encrypted computer in a locked file cabinet in a secured office. To additionally preserve confidentiality, we will only use participants’ SIDs and names will not be used in data analysis. Informed consent forms, 
audio files, and transcripts will be kept in locked files and password -protected databases in a 
locked office accessible only to investigators. Audio files will be destroyed within one year of study completion.  
 
2) E
motional discomfort during the assessment and/or while using the mobile app . While 
participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer any questions at any time, 
responses or reactions to certain questions may indicate distress on the part of the participants. 
If at any time during the study, a participant divulges that he is at risk for harm, including but not limited to being abused or experiencing violence, if harm is suspected or likely, or if the participant states he is suicidal/homicidal, measures will be taken to ensure his safety locally. Reporting will be made as appropriate to the situation and the legal statutes, and referrals will 
be provided for appropriate support, counseling or treatment resources.

Page 43   
  
3) D iscomfort during collection of blood specimen . Whenever possible, we will conduct a medical 
chart review in order to minimize the need for blood sample collection for participants. There 
are only two time points in the study that require a potential blood draw if VL is not provided in 
the participants’ medical chart (enrollment and 6 -month assessment). All necessary blood 
sample draws will be executed by [CONTACT_146365].  
 
I
n addition to a Certificate of Confidentiality, we will protect participants in the following ways:  
We will take every precaution to minimize risks to study participants. Adverse events will be reported to the UNC -CH IRB, individual research PI [INVESTIGATOR_112475], and STUDY site-specific IRBs per each 
institution’s IRB reporting requirements using Adverse Event CRF. When possible, reports will be sent within [ADDRESS_167635] completed training and received certification in Human Subjects Research Protection (CITI Program) and HIPAA regulations. They will continue to renew this training in compliance with the UNC IRB policy as well as their individual institutional policies.  
11.3.2   Benefits  
 
The risk to individual participants is small and the potential benefit to both the individual and society is 
substantial. The main benefit of the proposed study to society is the development of a potentially 
feasible and acceptable mobile app that improves HIV disclosure. Participants may experience improvements in their own experiences disclosing their HIV status, thereby  [CONTACT_146366]. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable. 
Study participants w ill be compensated for their time. 
 YMSM account for nearly two thirds of all new HIV infections in the US and YMSM are the only risk group experiencing a significant increase in HIV incidenc e. If successful, our intervention will improve 
these outcomes in  our subject population. Given this high potential impact and low potential hazards to 
participants, we find that a clear examination of these research questions outweighs the previously 
mentioned risks. The effectiveness of a novel, scalable, technology d riven, intervention to address HIV 
disclosure is understudied with this population. Given the significant health outcomes associated with 
HIV infections, and the paucity of intervention programs for this population of young adults, the 
knowledge to be gained from this research is significant. The risks to participants are reasonable in relation to the importance  of the knowledge to be gained.  
11.[ADDRESS_167636] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
 
This protocol, the informed assent/consent documents, and any subsequent modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_112535]. The informed 
assent/consent will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks a nd 
IGHID 14-0345  Version 2.0

Page 44   
 benefits of participation.  Consent/assent will be obtained to explain the nature, significance, and risks 
of the study. Sample informed consent/assent forms are included . 
11.5    Waiver of the Requirement for Parental Permission for Special Circumstances  
 
The site IRBs and the UNC IRB as the central IRB will be requested to grant a waiver of parental 
permission to participate in this research study for youth participants under (not  inclusive of) the age of 
18.   
Under 45 CFR 46.408 (c), an IRB has the author ity to waive parental permission if it determines that “a 
research protocol is designed for conditions or a subject population for which parental or guardian 
permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects” and “an appropriate mechanism for protecting the children who will participate as research subjects is substituted” and “that the waiver is not inconsistent with  Federal, State, or local law.”  
A request for a waiver of the requirement for parental permission is requested for 2 reasons:  1) many 
youth would be reluctant to participate in this study – which focuses on HIV and risks for poorer 
medication adherence – if they are required to get parental permission; and 2) many of the youth in our 
study are likely to be gay, bisexual , or have an attraction to persons of the same gender, but may not be 
out to their parents; requiring parental permission may place participants at risk for outing themselves 
as part of the LGBT community or having HIV. For these reasons, we believe it is important to be granted 
a waiver for parental permission for this study population.  
11.6  Waiver of the Requirement for Signed Consent Form  
11.6.1 For Eligibility Screening  
An online consent process for the eligibility screening is proposed. The introduction to the screening 
interview includes all the required elements for consent (45 CFR 46.116). No identifying information on 
volunteers is recorded during the online screening until a participant is determined eligible (i.e., by [CONTACT_112536] “I do consent to be screened for eligibility”). Therefore, there will be no identifying link of who 
agreed to be screened or not screened for the study. In addition, the screening presents minimal risk to participants and involves no procedures that would require written con sent outside of a research 
context. Under these conditions the IRB is authorized to modify the requirements to obtain a signed consent form for some or all subjects (45 CFR 46.117 [c]).  
11.7    Prisoner Participatio n  
 
NIMH has concluded that this protocol does NOT meet Federal requirements governing prisoner 
participation in human subjects research and should NOT be considered by [CONTACT_146367]. Subjects enrolled who subsequently become incarcerated or are placed in 
detention may not continue study participation. Study visits cannot be conducted during the period of 
incarceration or detention.

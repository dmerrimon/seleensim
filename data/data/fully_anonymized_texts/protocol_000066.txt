Methodology  Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
Nominal continuous variables will be represented as the mean +/ - SD 
and categorical variables will be noted as the number and percentage of 
total. Pearson chi -square test will be utilized to determine statistical 
significance for continuous variables where as a Student’s two -sample 
t-test will be implemented to determine statistical significance for 
continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate analyses will be 
performed when relevant. Statistical significance will be set a priori as 
a p-value less than 0.05. Concordance and discordance of 68Ga-
DOTATATE PET/CT with 18FDG  and 13NH 3 PET/CT for the presence 
or absence of CS will be calculated and utilizing 18FDG and 13NH 3 
PET/CT as the “gold -standard” for CS, the sensitivity and specificity 
of 68Ga-DOTATATE for the detection of CS will be determined. All 
statistical analyses will be performed using JMP Pro 9 (SAS Institute 
INC. Cary, North Carolina).  
 
Safety:  
The overall safety profile will be assessed in te rms of imaging agent 
related adverse events , and v ital signs.

Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018  1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and 
Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 B ackground/Rationale 
Optimizing our imaging capabilities for patients with CS is critical as it has diagnostic (3), 
pr
ognostic (4) and therapeutic implications (5). However, our current diagnostic techniques have 
several limitations. Detection of CS by [CONTACT_847561] 20% (6) . 
Gallium-67 single photon emission tomography (SPECT) scintigraphy and echocardiography 
also have a reported sensitivity of 40% and 25% respectively (7,8). MRI has improved sensitivity 
for detection of CS at 75% (9) but may be problematic in CS patients with an intracardiac device. 
P
erhaps more critical is that MRI lacks the ability to help differentiate active from inactive CS, 
which is critical for treatment planning and follow-up. Among the various invasive and 
noninvasive techniques, 18FDG PET/CT has the highest sensitivity for the detection of CS (10) 
but requires specific dietary preparation that is difficult for patients to follow and is not 
completely effective at eliminating physiologic 18FDG uptake. The latter may lead to 
inconclusive scan results in up to 30% of patients undergoing 18FDG PET/CT imaging for CS 
(11-16). Furthermore, the dietary preparation is particularly challenging for diabetic patients. A 
more ideal PET/CT tracer for CS imaging that would not demonstrate physiologic myocardial 
uptake, and therefore would not require special dietary preparation, would streamline our 
diagnostic practice and thereby [CONTACT_847562]. Moreover, such an agent would eliminate 
the need for extra staffing time to discuss dietary procedures with patients and ultimately lead t o 
fewer studies needing to be cancelled or repeated due to uncertain results. 68Ga DOTATATE is a 
radiotracer targeted to somatostatin receptors which has been recently FDA and CMS approved 
to image neuroendocrine tumors (17). However, 68Ga-DOTATATE may also be utilized off-label 
to image activated inflammatory cells, including macrophages and multinucleated giant cells that 
accumulate in granulomatous inflammation such as in sites of CS.  When activated, these cells 
e
xpress somatostatin receptors in high abundance. Ga-DOTATATE binds to these receptors, and 
ther
efore labels sites of active CS which can be then detected on a PET/CT scanner (18). 68Ga-
DOTATATE, however, is not taken up in normal myocardial tissues (2). Therefore, unlike 
18FDG, CS imaging with 68Ga-DOTATATE may obviate the need for complex patient 
preparation protocols and consequently may limit the incidence of uninterpretable scans, 
improve patient satisfaction and potentially improve diagnostic accuracy.

Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018  [IP_ADDRESS] Description 
“Dotatate, also known as DOTA-0-Tyr3-Octreotate , is a cyclic 8 amino acid peptide with a 
covalently bound chelator (dota). The peptide has the amino acid sequence: H-D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-
D-Trp-Lys-ThrCys-Thr-OH, and contains one disulfide bond. Dotatate has a molecular weight of 
1435.6 Daltons.” Figure from FDA.gov. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action 
“Ga [ADDRESS_1178340] affinity for subtype 2 receptors 
(sstr2). It binds to cells that express somatostatin receptors including malignant cells, which 
overexpress sstr2 receptors. Gallium 68 (68
Ga) is a β+ emitting radionuclide with an emission 
yield that allows positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
“Distribution Ga 68 dotatate distributes to all sstr2-expressing organs such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], thyroid, 
spleen, adrenals, kidney, pancreas, prostate, liver, and salivary glands . There is no uptake in the 
c
erebral cortex or in the heart, and usually thymus and lung uptakes are low.  
Elimination A total of 12% of the injected dose is excreted in urine in the first four hours post-
injection.”

Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018  [IP_ADDRESS] Dose 
5.4 mCi of 68Ga-DOTATAE will be administered. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiac Experience 
There are three critical components to support feasibility of the proposed project: 1) Clinically 
indicated 18FDG PET/CT (performed with 13NH 3 PET/CT as the standard of care) is already 
being performed at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster routinely with an average 4-[ADDRESS_1178341] been presented at national meetings based upon these studies, (19) (20) 2) 
The
 use of 68Ga-DOTATATE to image CS is predicated upon sound scientific reasoning, and 3) 
The
re are initial reports that 68Ga-DOTATATE may in fact be able to image CS. 
  
1) 18F
DG PET/CT can detect CS but is imperfect: PET/CT/ has proven to 
have the highest diagnostic accuracy for the detection of CS (10) with a 
re
ported sensitivity of 89% (10) and specificity as high as 97% (21). 
How
ever, these results are predicated upon sufficient dietary preparation. 
Unfortunately, dietary preparation is often inadequate (11). Indeed, in our 
own MCR
 patient population, one-fifth of patients had suboptimal dietary 
preparation which ultimately compromised image quality and test 
accuracy (19). As a result, multiple efforts have been undertaken to 
enhance dietary preparation for 18FDG PET/CT CS imaging (12-15). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_847551], there remains no uniform means for dietary 
preparation. Furthermore, these preparation procedures are onerous and 
include strict fasting, specific diet adherence and potentially the use of 
heparin. This is likely the reason for poor compliance with dietary 
preparations (16). It also requires extra nuclear laboratory personnel time 
to contact [CONTACT_847563]. For 
patients with diabetes mellitus, additional coordination must be made with 
the Department of Endocrinology. Given these issues, further efforts are 
warranted to identify another means by [CONTACT_847564]. 
 
FDG PET/CT for detecting CS also requires the concomitant use of 
myocardial perfusion PET/CT or SPECT imaging as the standard of care 
(cite SNMMI/ASNC expert consensus document), given the issues of 
physiologic FDG uptake and nonspecific findings and the potential for 
scar detection. This is associated with increased costs, greater cyclotron (if 
and 13NH 3 ammonia is used) and labs efforts, more patient time, and 
additional radiation exposure. A single scan with a single tracer has the 
potential to reduce effort and costs and increase patient satisfaction. 
  
18FDG
 PET/CT in CS Feasibility at Mayo Clinic : The multidisciplinary 
team we have assembled at Mayo Clinic has developed expertise in 
diagnosis and care of the CS population (12,13,19,20,22-26). Furthermore, 
we
 have one of the largest, if not largest CS practice in the nation with 
approximately 4-5 patients undergoing 18FDG PET/CT per week. This has 
allowed our technicians and nursing staff along with our physicians to 
Page  7 of 18  68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Assessment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis 
 
Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018  create a streamlined practice in performing cardiac imaging in this patient 
population. As a result our physician team members are lead authors on 
national guidelines (24) and our technicians are conducting national talks 
to educate other imaging staff on optimizing 18FDG PET/CT in CS (19). 
  
2)
     The use of 68Ga- DOTATATE is predicated upon sound scientific 
reasoning: 68Ga-DOTATATE is a somatostatin receptor targeted 
radiotracer traditionally used to image neuroendocrine tumors (17) . 
However, 68Ga-DOTATATE may also be utilized to image inflammatory 
cells typi[INVESTIGATOR_847552], including macrophages and multinucleated 
giant cells, because these cells express somatostatin receptors (18). 68Ga-
DOTATATE, however, is not taken up in normal myocardial tissue (2). 
Therefore, unlike 18FDG, CS imaging with 68Ga-DOTATATE may 
obviate the need for complex patient preparation protocols and 
consequently may limit the number of uninterpretable scans, improve 
patient satisfaction and potentially improve diagnostic accuracy. 
  
3)
     Initial reports of 68Ga-DOTATATE for CS: There are two studies of 
which the investigators are aware that examine the feasibility of 
somatostatin receptor ligands, such as 68Ga-DOTATATE, to image CS. 
The initial study compared PET/CT imaging with a radiolabeled 
somatostatin receptor ligand to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 
(CMR) for detection of CS (1) . This study demonstrated a 96.1% 
concordance rate between the two imaging modalities and concluded that 
the use of a somatostatin receptor ligand to detect CS was feasible. The 
second investigation imaged 19 patients with suspected CS with both 
18FDG PET/CT and 68Ga-DOTATATE (2) . The authors demonstrated that 
68Ga-DOTATATE outperformed 18FDG PET/CT with a100% accuracy for 
the 
detection of CS and a 100% inter-observer agreement in regards to the 
68Ga-DOTATATE results. Both of these studies offer evidence that 68Ga-
DOTATATE will be a promising agent for the detection of CS. 
  
68Ga-
DOTATATE  Feasibility at Mayo Clinic: Mayo Clinic is a leader in 
68Ga-DOTATATE production and imaging having already imaged over 
400 oncologic patients since October 2016. Furthermore, Mayo Clinic has 
pr
oven expertise in the production of 68Ga-DOTATATE with patents 
currently pending. Finally, members of the current grant application team 
(GJ and AK) are nationally recognized in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_847553] 68Ga-
DOTATATE imaging (27). 
 
2 Study
 Objectives 
To determine if 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging will have a similar accuracy as 18FDG 
PET/CT with 13NH 3 in diagnosing CS and if it will be able to do so without the need for complex 
pa
tient dietary preparation that is required with 18FDG PET/CT.

Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018  3 Study Design 
The proposed investigation is a feasibility study designed to assess the efficacy of 68Ga-
DOTATATE PET/CT imaging in the CS population.  We propose imaging 15 consecutive 
pa
tients initially (with an intention to do a larger study) with the standard of care approach 
of both 18FDG and 13NH 3 PET/CT and a research 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. The study 
group will include adult patients who undergo assessment in Mayo Clinic’s CS clinic and 
have suspected or newly diagnosed CS based upon clinical evaluation. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_847554] (note exact 
timeline may vary based on patient appointment schedule): 
1)     Up to  4-6 weeks prior to visit:  Patient charts will be reviewed prior to their initial 
appointment in the CS clinic. After review, the physician head of the CS clinic (LB) will 
refer candidates that have clinically suspected (7), or newly diagnosed CS and who will be 
referred for a clinically indicated 18FDG and 13NH 3 P ET/CT to the primary investigator 
(JB). JB or other designated staff will contact [CONTACT_847565] (using a phone/email script) to determine their potential interest in the study. If the 
patient expresses an interest in the study, a consent form will be sent in advance for their 
review. Patients may consent remotely if they choose or can also be consented in-person.  
Potential st
udy subjects will also be notified that they will be contact[CONTACT_847566]. 
2)     Day 1 : During their 18F DG and  13NH 3 PET/CT assessment, potential study candidates 
who have not been consented will be approached by [CONTACT_847567]. If the patient meets all criteria and agrees to participate in 
the study, then written consent will be obtained at that time. 
4)
     Day 2 or 3  (1- 2 days after 18FDG and 13NH 3 PET/CT): Those study candidates who 
consent to the investigation will then undergo the study 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan. 
The patient will be provided with a brief survey at the end of their imaging session which 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_847568] (if either) they 
preferred from a patient experience. Note patients will be allowed to complete the 68Ga-
DOTATATE PET/CT study within a month of the 18FDG and 13NH 3 PET/CT exam as long 
as no intervening immunomodulatory therapy has been administered. 
5)     Chart and imaging review will be conducted for each of the 15 patients in the study 
for
 purposes of drafting the study manuscript.

6 Methods  
 
6.1 PET /CT  Imaging  
6.1.1 PET/CT Imaging Protocol 
A GE Discovery 690XT, Discovery Molecular Insights (DMI) or 710 PET/CT system (GE 
Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) will be utilized in performing the studies. The imaging system 
consists of full ring Cerium -doped Lutetium Yttrium Orthosilicate (LYSO) crystals. 128x128 
PET matrix size with zoomed 41.[ADDRESS_1178345] will be employed with auto exposure control with modulated current in 
order to maintain consistent noise index (noise index set at 33 with mA range 10-180). For our 
CT attenuation imaging tube ration is 0.5 s, kV is 120 and pi[INVESTIGATOR_847556] 0.98. Slice thickness is 3.75 
mm and slice increment is 3.27 mm. Matrix size is 512 x 21.  
 
As per all of our clinical 18FDG PET/CT CS studies 13NH 3 will be administered to optimize 
diagnostic accuracy for CS. This same perfusion map will be used for the 68Ga-DOTATAE 
imaging portion (no additional ammonia N-13 will be given for the 68Ga-DOTATATE study). 
6.1.2 Analysis of PET data 
 
Once the cardiac PET/CT images are obtained they will be assessed for the presence of CS 
utilizing similar methodologies which were previously published (1,2,24).  
 
Qua
litative assessment of 18FDG and 13NH 3 PET/CT and 68Ga-DOTATATE for each study 
subj
ect will be made by [CONTACT_847569] (JB and AK) who will be blinded to the 
patient clinical history , laboratory data and any other imaging assessment (including the 
corresponding CS study-i.e. when reading the 68Ga-DOTATATE study investigators will be 
blinded to the 18FDG results and vice versa) at the time of interpretation. For both 18FDG and 
68Ga-DOTATATE cardiac uptake study investigators will classify the patient into one of four 
categories of radionuclide uptake: none, diffuse, focal, and focal on diffuse or diffuse. The 
portions of the myocardium that demonstrate uptake will be documented in accordance with the 
17 segment American Heart Association model (28). In concordance with national 
g
uidelines(24), 18FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE examinations will be interpreted simultaneously 
with 13NH 3 to allow for assessment of myocardial perfusion.  Both 18FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE 
studies will then be labeled as positive for CS, negative for CS or inconclusive.  
 
Any discordance between the findings of the two investigators in regards to the presence or 
absence of CS as well as the extent will be reviewed by [CONTACT_627695] (GJ or PC) and 
final determination in regards to classification of the patient will be made.  
Page  12 of 18  68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Assessment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis 
 
Version 1.0, 03 /22/[ADDRESS_1178346] uptake value (SUVmax) of 18FDG and 68Ga-
DOTATATE in the heart. This data will be correlated with patient clinical data obtained from the 
medical record. 
 
The two study investigators (JB and AK) who are reviewing all studies will rank their confidence 
level for interpretation for each scan on a 5 point scale (1=least confident, 5= most confident).  
Results will then be compared between the two study modalities. 
 
After completion of both their 18FDG and 13NH [ADDRESS_1178347] two question will ask the patient to rate the ease of 
undergoing each study on a 5 point scale (1=easiest, 5=hardest). The third question will ask the 
patient which study they preferred (18FDG, 68Ga-DOTATATE or equal) with a comment section 
for why. 
 
7 Statistical Plan 
General Considerations 
Continuous data  (e.g., age) will be summarized using the following descriptive summary 
statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum 
value (max). For each continuous variable, the corresponding mean, median, minimum and 
maximum will be presented to [ADDRESS_1178348] and the SD to 2 decimal places, unless otherwise 
specified.  
Categorical variables  (e.g., qualitative presence of absence of 68Ga-DOTATATE) will be 
summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to [ADDRESS_1178349]. 
Summaries of continuous and categorical data will be presented, as appropriate. 
Incomplete/Missing data : Missing data (e.g., dates, post-baseline values) will not be imputed, 
unless otherwise specified; i.e., all missing values and missing post-baseline values will remain 
as missing in all statistical analyses and listings, unless otherwise specified. 
Outliers:  No formal statistical analyses will be performed to detect and/or remedy the presence 
of statistical outliers. 
Additionally, all subject data, including derived variables, will be presented in subject data 
listings; listings will display all subjects who were randomized or enrolled in the study.   
7.1.1 Background Characteristics  
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, weight, height and body 
mass index [BMI]) will be summarized.  
7.1.2  Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Nominal continuous variables will be represented as the mean +/- SD and categorical variables 
will be noted as the number and percentage of total. Pearson chi-square test will be utilized to 
determine statistical significance for continuous variables whereas a Student’s two-sample t-test 
will be implemented to determine statistical significance for continuous variables. Univariate and 
Page  13 of 18  68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Assessment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis 
 
Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018  multivariate analyses will be performed when relevant. Statistical significance will be set a priori 
as a p-value less than 0.05. Concordance and discordance of 68Ga-DOTATATE with 18FDG and 
13NH 3 PET/CT for the presence or absence of CS will be calculated and utilizing 18FDG PET/CT 
as the “gold-standard” for CS, the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-DOTATATE for the 
detection of CS will be determined. Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_418269]. All statistical analyses will be performed using JMP Pro 9 (SAS Institute INC. Cary, 
North Carolina).  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1 De finitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study-related documents 
such as the IRB-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm). 
 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered 
to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associat ed with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_847570] (see below), the term 
“condition” may include abnormal physical examination findings, symptoms, or diseases. 
 C onditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical history 
(e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints). 
 C onditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history. 
 C onditions that pertain to efficacy variables of this study, i.e. findings on PET and which 
are considered pre-existing medical conditions, are not considered AEs unless there is 
worsening. This also implies that the indication for the imaging procedure and the 
confirmation of a diagnosis will not be considered as an AE. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that 
is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_847557]  14 of 18  68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT Assessment of Cardiac Sarcoidosis 
 
Version 1.0, 03 /22/2018   results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
 
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events will be reported is defined as [ADDRESS_1178350] 
injection of the radiotracer.   
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the 
condition worsens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_16469], the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last 
scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) 
that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to 
participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or 
adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study 
participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if 
the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly 
in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37022] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in 
this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event 
if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Ne
ither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68034] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233696]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], 
unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49849].

Version 1.0, 03 /22/[ADDRESS_1178351] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse 
event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped 
under one diagnosis. 
 
All adverse events occurring during the imaging AE reporting period must be recorded.  The 
clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that 
are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final 
outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be 
possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately. 
8.[ADDRESS_1178352] be 
reported are those that are: 
 related to study participation, 
 unexpected, and  
 serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).   
 
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the 
time of the initial report includes: 
 Study identifier  
 Subject number  
 A description of the event  
 Date of onset   Current status  
 Whether study was discontinued  
 The reason why the event is classified as 
serious.  
 
8.3.1 Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo Clinic IRB 
 
Rep
orting Process 
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjects or others as noted above will be reported to the 
Mayo Clinic IRB as a written report of the event (including a description of the event with 
information regarding its fulfillment of the above criteria, follow-up/resolution and need for 
revision to consent form and/or other study documentation). 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1178353] safety will be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_32366]. This safety monitoring will 
include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events and a regular assessment 
of the number and type of serious adverse events.

Version 1.0, 03 /22/[ADDRESS_1178354] of 1996 (HIPAA).  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.   
9.2 S ource Documents 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source 
data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ 
diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], 
microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical departments involved 
in the clinical trial. 
 
Source documents for the imaging protocol will be kept in a secure location by [CONTACT_1961] ([CONTACT_847575]) or his designee.  
9.3 Data Man agement Plan 
We will create a database to store patient data. This database will be programmed in REDCap 
(Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a secure, web-based application with the 
capacity for direct export to Excel and common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Strata, R). 
REDCap has electronic CRF (eCRF)s, real-time data entry validation, audit trails, user 
authentication, data logging and encryption. It is HIPAA compliant with mechanisms in place to 
ensure confidentiality. In addition, logical data checks will be used to assess data quality for mis-
entry. Suspect data entries will be flagged for re-review and confirmation by [CONTACT_847571]. When data are complete and all suspect entries addressed for a time period, the database 
will be “locked” for analysis. Analysis will use only this final locked version. 
 
9.4 Data S haring Plan 
Clinical data will be exported from REDCap into proper statistical software format for analysis. 
The
 final dataset will be provided in proper format to investigators participating in data analysis. 
The mode of data sharing will be by [CONTACT_847572]. Data w ill 
be secured by [CONTACT_847573].

Bioequivalence [BE] Study with Clinical 
Endpoints  
Objectives  
 To evaluate the therapeutic equivalence and safety of Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 1% 
(Akorn Pharmaceuticals) and Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 1% (Greenstone LLC) in 
the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
 To demonstrate the superiority of the efficacy of the Test and Reference products over that of 
the Placebo control in the treatment of acne vulgaris.  
Methodology  
Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 1% (CleocinT®, Greenstone, LLC) for topi[INVESTIGATOR_826022] [ADDRESS_1145631] for the safe and effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_826023].  Greenstone, LLC is the authorized generic manufacturer  of CleocinT®.  Akorn 
Pharmaceuticals has developed a new generic formulation of Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 1%.  
The current study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  this new generic formulation.  
Subjects in t his multi -center , double -blind, placebo -controlled , parallel group  study , were randomly 
assigned in a 2:2:[ADDRESS_1145632], Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 1% 
(Akorn Pharmaceuticals), the Reference product, Clindamycin Phosphate Topi[INVESTIGATOR_261060], 1% 
(Greenstone  LLC) or Placebo ( Vehicle gel of the Test product) . 
The study treatment consisted of  a topi[INVESTIGATOR_45559] -application of the investigational product  (IP) to the  
affected areas of the face twice daily, in the morning and evening, for 84 consecutive days  (12 weeks) .  
A thin layer of the IP, approximately a pea -sized amount  was applied around the same time every day, 
after the subject’s face had been washed with a non -medicated cleanser and warm water.   For the 
purposes of this study, the face was considered to start at the hairline and end at the jaw line and 
exclude d the eyes, lips , and all mucous membranes .  Subjects w ere required to use diari es to document 
the date of study treatments, any missed treatments , and the occurrence of all adverse events  (AEs) .   
Scheduled study visits  included : 
 Visit 1: Screening / Baseline Visit (Day 0);  
 Visit 2: First Interim  Visit ( Week 4 / Day 28 ± 4 days );  
 Visit  3: Second Interim Visit ( Week 8 / Day 56 ± 4 days ); and  
 Visit 4: End of Treatment  Visit ( Week 12 / Day 84 ± 4 days ).

After informed consent process and completion of all screening assessments, a baseline acne grade was 
assigned to the subject  using  the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) and a baseline lesion count 
was performed.  Subjects were admitted into the study if they had a clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris 
of severity Grades 2, 3, or 4 at baseline and if they met inclusion/exclusion cr iteria.  The  blinded IP 
was dispensed to those  subjects who met all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria .  The first 
application of IP was performed by [CONTACT_79987].  
During each subsequent  study visits, evaluations of efficacy (i.e., lesion counts and IGA) were 
conducted.  Safety was assessed by [CONTACT_826026]/or symptoms of local 
irritation.  
Number of Subject s (Planned and Analyzed)  
Approximately , [ADDRESS_1145633] s were planned to  be enrolled and random ly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio 
(Test 450: Reference  450: Vehicle  225) to obtain approximately 10 70 (428:428:214) subject s in the 
modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population and 855 (342:342:171 ) subject s in the Per -Protocol (PP) 
population.   
In the study, [ADDRESS_1145634] s were enrolled and randomized; [ADDRESS_1145635] s in the Vehicle  group.  Overall, all of the 
1125  subjects qualified for  the Safety population, 1095 (97.3 %) subject s qualified for the mITT 
population , and 988 (87.8 %) subject s for the PP population.  
Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion  
Subject s were eligible for the study only if they met all of the following criteria:  
1. Healthy male or non -pregnant female aged ≥12 and ≤40 years with a clinical diagnosis of acne 
vulgaris.  
2. 18 years or older (up to the age of 40) had to provide an institutional review board (IRB) -approved 
written informed consent.  Subjects who were 12 to 17  years of age , inclusive had to provide IRB 
approved written assent; this written assent was to be accompanied by [CONTACT_826027]’s legally acceptable representative (i.e., parent or guardian).  In 
addition, all subjects or their legally acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) had to sign 
a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization.  
3. Had a minimum ≥25 non -inflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed comedones) and 
≥20 inflammatory lesions (i.e., papules and pustules) and ≤2 nodulocystic lesions (i.e., nodules and 
cysts), at baseline on the face.  For the purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions 
were  limited to the facial treatment area.  All lesions w ere counted, including those present on the 
nose.  Subjects who had  acne lesions on other areas of the body were  excluded from the count, 
treatment, and the IGA evaluation (e.g., on the back, chest and arms).

4. Had a definite clinical diagnosis of acne vulgaris severity Grade 2, 3, or 4 as per the IGA as 
follows:  
Grade  Description  
[ADDRESS_1145636] clear; rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than one small inflammatory 
lesion  
2  Mild severity; greater than Grade 1; some non -inflammatory lesions with no more than a 
few inflammatory lesions (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions)  
3  Moderate severity; greater than Grade 2; up to many non -inflammatory lesions and may 
have some inflammatory lesions, but no more than one small nodular lesion  
4*  Severe; greater than Grade 3; up to many non -inflammatory lesions and may have some 
inflammatory lesions, but no more than a few nodular lesions  
*The electronic case report form ( eCRF ) for acne studies allowed for reporting of lesion worsening 
beyond Grade  [ADDRESS_1145637] s 
with nodulocystic acne.  Subjects who worsened beyond Grade 4 were described in the safety evaluation.  
Note: Nodulocystic lesions were not included in the inflammatory lesion count.  Counts of nodules and 
cysts were reported separately and not included in the inflammatory or non -inflammatory lesion counts.  
5. Refrain ed from using all other topi[INVESTIGATOR_826024] 
12-week treatment period  for acne vulgaris , other than the IP.  
6. Female  subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who were premenarchal, surgically 
sterilized, or postmenopausal  for at least 1 year), in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy 
test, had to be willing to use an acceptable form of birth control d uring the study from the day of 
the first dose administration to [ADDRESS_1145638] administration of study drug.  For the purpose 
of this study, the following were considered acceptable methods of birth control: oral or injectable 
contraceptives, cont raceptive patches, Depo -Provera® (stabilized for at least 3 months) , NuvaRing® 
(vaginal contraceptive), Implanon™ (contraceptive implant), double barrier methods (e.g., condom 
and spermicide), intrauterine device, or abstinence with a second acceptable met hod of birth 
control if the subject became sexually active.  Subjects on hormonal contraception had to be 
stabilized on the same type for at least three months prior to enrollment in the study and must not 
change the method during the study.  A sterile sex ual partner was not considered an adequate form 
of birth control . 
7. All male subjects had to agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their partners, from the 
day of the first dose administration to [ADDRESS_1145639] administration of study d rug.  
Abstinence was an acceptable method of birth control.  Female partners had to use an acceptable 
method of birth control as described above (# 6). 
8. Were w illing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the protocol, including 
attendance at the required study visits.

Duration of Treatment  
The study treatment period was of 84 days (12 weeks).  A 9-day window (i.e., ± 4 days ) was 
considered acceptable for each scheduled visit following the baseline  visit.  The st udy duration was 
expected at 6 months.  
Criteria for Evaluation  
Co-primary  Efficacy Endpoint s: 
 The co-primary efficacy endpoints were percent change from baseline to Week 12 in the 
inflammatory (papules and pustules) and in the non -inflammatory (open and closed comedones) 
lesion counts . 
Secondary  Efficacy Endpoint:  
 The secondary endpoint was the IGA score, expressed in terms of treatment success or failure.  
Success was defined as an IGA score at W eek [ADDRESS_1145641] 2 grades less than the baseline 
assessment.  Failure was defined as an IGA score that was the sa me, higher or one grade lower than 
the baseline assessment.   
Safety Evaluation : 
 Adverse events  throughout.  
 Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) at Visit 1.  
 Brief p hysical examination  at Visit 1.  
 Concomitant medications and non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_826025]. 
 Signs/ symptoms of local irritation (application site reactions such as erythema, dryness, 
burning/stinging, erosion, edema, pain, and itching  were recorded at each study visit to allow a 
comparison between treatment groups ) 
Statistical Methods  
All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Version 9. [ADDRESS_1145642] , and visit/time point where appropriate.  
Continuous data were described using descriptive statistics (i.e. , number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum).  Categorical data were described using count and 
percentage s.  All statistical tests were two -sided at a signifi cance level of α = 0.05, unless otherwise 
indicated.   
The analysis populations  used in this study were:  
 Safety Population : The Safety Population  consist ed of all subjects who were randomized into the 
study and received at least one dose of IP according to  subject's diary.  If it was unknown whether

the subject received any IP, that subject w as also included in the safety population .  The Safety 
Population  was the primary population for the safety analysis.  
 Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : The mITT set consisted of all Safety population 
subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and had at least one post -baseline efficacy 
evaluation .  This population was considered  as definitive for testing superiority  and supportive for 
testing bio equivalence . 
 Per-protocol (PP) Population : The PP population included all mITT subjects who applied 75% to 
125% of the scheduled applications of the assigned product; did not miss applications for more 
than three consecutive days; returned for the Week [ADDRESS_1145643] after completing minimum 
four weeks of treatment or; and had no protocol deviations that affected proper administration of 
the treatment, or accur ate evaluation of its effectiveness.  This population was considered as 
definitive for testing of bioequivalence and supportive for testing superiority . 
Determination  of Sample Size  
The sample size for this protocol was based on published data on clindamycin phosphate topi[INVESTIGATOR_34600], 
1% and Cleocin T® Summary Basis  of Approval and Label (approved January  2016) .   
Approximately , 1125  subjects  were to  be enrolled and random ly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio (T est 45 0: 
Reference 45 0: Vehicle  225) to obtain approximately 10 70 (428:428:214) subject s in the mITT 
population and 855 (342:342:171 ) subject s in the PP population .  This sample size was to provide at 
least a 90% probability of showing that the 90% confidence intervals ( CIs) on the Test/Reference ratio  
of mean percent reduction from baseline, for both lesion types, were contained within the interval 
0.[ADDRESS_1145644] and Reference 
products were statistically superior (p<0.05) to the Vehi cle in the mITT population.  
Hypothesis of Bioe quivalence  (Co-primary Endpoints)  
A two -sided, 90% CI on the Test/Reference ratio for mean percent change from baseline to Week 12 in 
lesion count  was constructed using Fieller’s method.  The estimates of treatment means and standard 
errors w ere obtained from a two -way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the Test and Reference results, 
using a statistical model containing terms for treatment and center.  If  the assumptions of normal error 
and homogeneity of variance  were not satisfied, a ranked -based, nonparametric approach w as to be 
used to obtain the CI.  
Bioequivalence w as established if the 90% CIs for the ratio of Test/Reference means, for both lesion 
types, were contained  within the interval  [0.80, 1.25] for the P P population.  
 
Akorn Pharmaceuticals - CLMG 1711 – Clinical Study Report  
 
 
 
 
9 Hypothesis of Bioequivalence (Secondary Endpoint)  
A two -sided , continuity -corrected, 90% CI on the test -to-reference difference for the proportion of 
subjects with treatment  succe ss on the IGA was constructed.  Bioequivalence was established if the 
90% CI for the difference was contained within the interval [ -0.20, +0.20] for the PP population.  
Hypothesis of Superiority  (Co-primary Endpoints)  
The null hypothesis to be tested was that there was no difference in the mean percent change from 
baseline to Week  12, in each lesion type, between the active treatment and the Vehicle treatment.   The 
hypothesis testing w as performed separately for the Test treatment versus the Vehicle treatment and for 
the Reference treatment versus the Vehicle treatment using ANOVA under assumption of normal error 
and homogeneity of variance.  If the assumptions of normal error and homogene ity of variance were 
not satisfied, a ranked -based, nonparametric method w as to be used.  
Superiority w as established if the mean percent change from baseline for each active treatment, for 
each lesion type, was less than (i.e. , more negative), and statisti cally different from (p<0.05), that for 
the Vehicle (placebo) using the mITT study population and last observation carried forward (LOCF).  
Hypothesis of Superiority (Secondary Endpoint)  
The null hypothesis to be tested was that there was no difference in t he proportions of subjects with 
treatment success on the IGA.  The evaluation of superiority w as conducted separately for the Test 
treatment versus the Vehicle treatment and for the Reference treatment versus the Vehicle treatment.  
The analysis w as conduc ted using two -sided, α = 0.05, Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel  (CMH)  exact test 
stratified by [CONTACT_91294].  Superiority w as established if the success proportion for each active 
treatment was greater than, and statistically different from (p<0.05), that of the Ve hicle (placebo).  
Safety Analyses  
Incidence of all AEs reported during the study were summarized using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA , Version 20. 1) by [CONTACT_1570], body system, severity, and 
relationship to study drug.  A summary of the frequencies (number and percentage) of subjects with 
treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ), serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and for 
TEAEs lead ing to death were presented by [CONTACT_6657].  Additionally, 
number and percentage of subjects with TEAE were summarized by [CONTACT_826028] .  Proportion of subjects experiencing TEAEs that oc curred in at least 
1% of subjects in either Test o r Reference groups w as compared between these groups using Fisher’s 
exact test.    
Results of physical  examination findings , vital sign s, and s igns/ symptoms of local irritation  were listed.   
Number and perce ntage  of subjects with each severity w ere presented by [CONTACT_826029] .

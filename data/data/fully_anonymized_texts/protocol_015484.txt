Objectives & hypotheses to be tested
To evaluate the efficacy and onset of action of Bonipar in controlling pain in patients with acute and 
chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes.
Background & Significance
Should support the scientific aims of the research
Acute and chronic pain patients with musculoskeletal-skeletal pain are treated in many ways. The use of 
pharmacological agents in treating these is frequently associated with unacceptable complications: non-
selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) may cause serious gastrointestinal disorders 
including hemorrhage requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780061]; COX2-selective NSAIDS may also 
cause GI complications but more especially may cause coronary events especially in hypertensive patients; 
acetaminophen and related drugs may cause hepatic dysfunction and occasionally liver failure and opi[INVESTIGATOR_780062], drug abuse, drug diversion and addiction which are currently 
assuming epi[INVESTIGATOR_780063]. As a consequence of these undesirable pharmacological issues, 
the search for safe and effective drugs to treat both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain continues.
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_780064] a place in managing musculoskeletal pain but their scientific efficacy has usually 
been anecdotal and seldom subjected to investigational scrutiny. These topi[INVESTIGATOR_780065]. The use of natural 
compounds e.g. essential oils from selective herbal extracts have been used by [CONTACT_780079][INVESTIGATOR_780066].
Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and onset of action of Bonipar, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_780059] a variety of essential oils, in controlling pain in patients with acute and chronic 
musculoskeletal pain, as compared to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_609008], Diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%.
 
Design & Procedures
Describe the study, providing detail regarding the study intervention (drug, device, physical 
procedures, manipulation of the subject or the subject’s environment, etc.). Discuss justifications for 
placebo control, discontinuation or delay of standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and washout periods if applicable. 
Identify procedures, tests and interventions performed exclusively for research purposes or more 
frequently than standard of care. Include alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72297], risk benefit ratio, and use of tissue/specimens. Discuss monitoring during washout periods if 
applicable. Include brief description of follow-up, if any.
This study is a non-inferiority study comparing efficacy and onset of action between the herbal extracts 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461], Bonipar, and diclofenac sodium topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461], diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% (approved 
by [CONTACT_4760] a topi[INVESTIGATOR_34499]). Approximately 240 Duke patients will be recruited from Duke Pain 
Clinic, and selected Duke primary care practices, as well as the Durham VA site. Individuals who report 
acute (less than 3 months duration) or chronic musculoskeletal pain of any intensity will be considered for 
enrollment into the study. After obtaining consent, eligible subjects will be will be randomized to receive 
Bonipar or diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%.
For study purposes, diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% will be used off-label—that is, it may be used for pain 
not known to be caused by [CONTACT_32207]. However, this study does not aim to identify a new indication for 
diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%.
Baseline Assessments
The following baseline assessments will be completed prior to administration of study drug:
· Review of medical history
· Although the risk of serious side effects is low when diclofenac is applied to the skin, pregnant
women will be excluded from this study. Urine pregnancy screening will be conducted for all female
subjects of childbearing potential.* Women who have a positive pregnancy test would be excluded.
· Limited skin examination and blood pressure measurement.  We will exclude patients with SBP > 160
and DBP > 95 at screening.
· Collect pain information such as onset, pain intensity 24 hours prior and immediately before study
drug application
*Female subjects are considered “of child-bearing potential” if they (a) are anatomically
and physiologically capable of becoming pregnant and (b) they will be, or could possibly
be, engaging in sexual activity with males while study interventions that pose the
possibility of harm to a fetus are occurring. Note that this time period also includes any
time after study activities have ended where the protocol specifies the use of
contraception.
Dose, Delivery and Dispensing
After obtaining consent, subjects will be randomized to one of two study groups (Bonipar or diclofenac 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%), utilizing a predetermined randomization schedule in a 1:[ADDRESS_1072175] sunlight because it is likely that sunlight could result in the 
degradation and/or decomposition of some of the essential oils contained in Bonipar. For blinding 
purposes, Diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% will be stored in the same opaque plastic bottle.  
The bottles will be labeled either ”Drug A” or Drug B” according to their designation, lot #, BUD (beyond 
use dating), dosing instructions, and FDA statement “Caution: New Drug—Limited by 
[CONTACT_44505]”. Thus, the drugs would be blinded to both the patients and to the 
investigators. Only the unblinded Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) will have access to the 
randomization scheme and will have the knowledge of the dispensed drugs.  To avoid any bias, the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_780067] [ADDRESS_1072176] daily drug application, pain scores before and after application and any other oral 
pain medication taken. Subjects are permitted in the study to take acetaminophen (325 to 650 mg tablet 
up to 4 times a day) if pain persists even with the study drug application.
Subjects will be instructed to observe the following instructions:
1. Please wash and dry hands before and after use.
2. Do not apply to skin with open wounds, or blistered or inflamed areas of the skin.
3. Avoid contact [CONTACT_780080].
4. Do not apply external heat.

Follow- Up
All subjects will be asked to come back for a study visit at one week (+/- 1 day) after initial dosing for 
assessment, to return the completed diary and remainder of the study drug. If subjects are not able to 
physically return for the follow-up visit, a remote video follow-up visit can be done for the required study 
assessments. Remote visits will not be audio or video recorded. Subjects completing a remote video follow-
up visit must return to clinic for a physical follow-up visit when able. Subjects who do not receive adequate 
pain relief during the study may opt to drop out and resume taking their prior prescribed medications or 
they may return to their primary care physician. If this occurs, subjects will be asked to discard any 
unused study drug.
DURATION OF STUDY:
This study will be for 1 weeks from initial study drug application.
 
OUTCOME MEASURES:

Risk/Benefit Assessment
Include a thorough description of how risks and discomforts will be minimized (per 45 CFR 46.111(a) (1 
and 2)). Consider physical, psychological, legal, economic and social risks as applicable. If vulnerable 
populations are to be included (such as children, pregnant women, prisoners or cognitively impaired 
adults), what special precautions will be used to minimize risks to these subjects? Also identify what 
available alternatives the person has if he/she chooses not to participate in the study. Describe the 
possible benefits to the subject. What is the importance of the knowledge expected to result from the 
research?
Herbal products have been used relatively safe for years with very few adverse effects. FIDAPIN, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_780074] (except for one herbal oil), had been studied in 
a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in 196 subjects with chronic musculoskeletal pain 
involving Fidapin (n=64), Diclofenac ointment (n=67) and a placebo (Jasmine oil, n=65).  All groups 
showed a significant decrease in pain after 2 and 4 weeks. Both the diclofenac (4 subjects) and placebo 
group (2 subjects) developed adverse events (superficial rashes) while those receiving Fidapin did not 
experience any adverse effects or complications. The superficial rashes receded after discontinuation of the 
therapy.  One subject on the diclofenac group had a progressive radicular pain and paresthesia – that 
subsided when it was discontinued after [ADDRESS_1072180] a skin examination on the treated area at baseline (before treatment). The area will be examined 
for the presence of the following: skin discolorations, hyperemia, skin elevations, scratch marks, wheals, 
pruritus, bruises, hair pattern, skin effusions and presence of any abnormal skin characteristics. AEs, if 
any, will be recorded at the follow-up study visit and the patient may be asked to return if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_780075].
Costs to the Subject
Describe and justify any costs that the subject will incur as a result of participation; ordinarily, subjects 
should not be expected to pay for research without receiving direct benefit.
There will be no additional costs as a result of being in this study. Bonipar and diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 
1.5% will be provided free of charge for use in this study.
Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations
Describe endpoints and power calculations. Provide a detailed description of how study data will be 
analyzed, including statistical methods used, and how ineligible subjects will be handled and which 
subjects will be included for analysis. Include planned sample size justification. Provide estimated time 
to target accrual and accrual rate. Describe interim analysis including plans to stop accrual during 
monitoring. Phase I studies, include dose escalation schema and criteria for dose escalation with 
definition of MTD and DLT.
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the reduction in acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain 
by [CONTACT_780087][INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%. Pain responses at 
base line and at two-week follow up will be measured in the scale of [ADDRESS_1072181] level of pain. For each patient, primary outcome variable will be measured in two 
ways: i) compute whether the decrease in pain by 50% between baseline and 1-week follow-up (i.e. 
binary variable) and, ii) calculate the absolute difference in pain score between baseline and 1-week follow-
up (continuous variable). Statistical power and sample size was determined based on the binary outcome 
variable. 
Initial data characteristics will be compared between groups using chi-square for categorical variables and 
t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables. Change in pain from baseline will be compared
between two treatment groups using chi-square test for binary variable and t-test or equivalent non-
parametric test for continuous variable, as appropriate. The significance level of the test will be targeted at
α=0.05 (one sided). Non-inferiority will be established, at the 0.05 significance level if the lower limit of
equivalent two-sided 90% confidence interval for the difference in success rate is above non-inferiority
margin. Multivariable linear regression analysis will be performed to examine the changes in pain score
adjusting potential confounders such as type of pain (lumbar vs. other), prior duration with pain. Reports
of side effects will also be investigated between two groups. As an exploratory analysis we will evaluate
the time to onset of action between two topi[INVESTIGATOR_191817], where time to onset variable will be measured
within 1 hour (as  15 min, < 30 min,  45 min or 
 60 min) after the application of drugs at clinic. No < < < 
adjustments will be made for the multiple endpoints testing. All analyses will be conducted using SAS
version 9.4.
Analysis will be performed for the full datasets and by [CONTACT_780088] (acute and chronic).
Power Calculation: 
Preliminary data to base on power analysis
Meta-analysis from Massey et al (Cochrane Database Syst Rev.; (6) 2014) presented data from combined 
three studies comparing topi[INVESTIGATOR_780076] (Joussellin 2003; Predel 2004; Rowbotham 
2003). A total of 319 participants were treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_6841], and 307 with placebo. The success 
rate (i.e. patient reported pain relief at least 50%) was
52% (166/319, range 39% to 92%) for group treated with diclofenac and 25% (77/307, range 8% to 
36%) for placebo group.
Assumptions behind power calculations:
There will be two equal-sized treatment arms, one containing diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% treated 
1.  
2.  There will be two equal-sized treatment arms, one containing diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% treated 
patients and the other Bonipar treated patients. The arms will be compared for a difference in success rate 
(i.e. pain reduction at least 50% from baseline to follow-up at 1 weeks) with Z-test (one-sided at alpha=0.
05) using PASS software. Two scenarios will be considered, as follows:
The success rate will be 52% among diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%vs. 62% true success rate 
among Bonipar group (with -10% non-inferiority margin)
The success rate will be 52% among diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5%vs. 67% true success rate 
among Bonipar group (with -10% non-inferiority margin)
Difference D =P - P  (non-inferiority margin)0 2 1
H : P - P ≤D0 2 1 0
H : P - P = D >D1 2 1 1 0
D : True observed difference i.e. P (H ) - P1 1 1 2
Where P & P  represent the proportion of success for Bonipar and diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% group1 2
respectively.
Statistical power and required sample size for the aforementioned two scenarios are presented in the table.
Power Alpha D0D1P2P (H )1 0P (H )1 1 N1 N2 Total N

0.80 0.05 -0.10 0.15 0.52 0.42 0.67 49 49 98
Pass software was used to determine sample size of the study. With a sample size of 152 (76  per group), 
we will be able to achieve 80% statistical power to detect a difference in success rate on pain reduction of 
10% between Bonipar and diclofenac topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] 1.5% groups with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. If 
we consider a 10% drop out rate, we will need to enroll 8 more patients per group a total of 168. This 
10% drop out rate did not reflect the patient population. Consequently, we plan to consent 240 subjects in 
order to reach our target goal of 152 completed subjects.
Interim Analysis: 
After approximately 50% of the study is completed (75 to 95 patients), we plan to carry a preliminary 
statistical analysis of the patients who have completed the study at that time.
We do NOT plan to analyze the primary data i.e. the pain scores of the two groups because that process 
could potentially interfere with the non-inferiority integrity of the final analysis of that data.
We are therefore proposing on the advice and approval of our Consultant Statisticians:
1) to analyze all the data as one group and not to differentiate between the group receiving the study drug
and the group receiving Diclofenac.
2) to analyze the secondary data including adverse effects and dropout status from the study and to
perform a comparative analysis between the two groups.
Data & Safety Monitoring
Summarize safety concerns, and describe the methods to monitor research subjects and their data to 
ensure their safety, including who will monitor the data, and the frequency of such monitoring. If a 
data monitoring committee will be used, describe its operation, including stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72313], and if it is independent of the sponsor (per 45 CFR 46.111(a) (6)).
There is no plan for formal data and safety monitoring board. Given the small target size for enrollment, 
we do not feel that a formal DSMB is necessary. However, all adverse events should be immediately 
reported to the principal investigator, [CONTACT_780089]. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_780077]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_780078] a 
weekly basis. All adverse events will be reported to the FDA at the end of the study.

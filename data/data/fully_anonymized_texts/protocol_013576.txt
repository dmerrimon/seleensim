BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Xerostomia following radiotherapy cancer treatment is mainly caused by 
[CONTACT_171985] [1]. 
Changes in salivary functionality and symptomatology show deterioration in the 
short term (< 6 months) with some subsequent improvement [2]. This decrease in 
functionality is associated with a decrease in quality of life, especially involving the 
faculties of eating, speaking and swallowing [3- 4]. Radiation therapy -induced 
chronic xerostomia is a challenge for both patient and tr eating physician. Although, 
there are remedies available to mitigate the symptoms, the best approach would 
involve prevention or minimizing its incidence. This may be done by [CONTACT_171986] (NTCP) [5]. 
There are numerous studies that describe NTCP of different organs [6- 10]. 
Regarding the parotid glands, the most commonly used model is the Lyman-Kutcher -Burman (LKB) model using the mean dose to the parotid gland as 
predictive of xerostomia [11- 12]. Although, dose- volume techniques are a 
mainstay of current treatment planning, the use of biological objectives in IMRT 
planning has shown potential for reducing radiation- induced toxicity [13- 15].  
Traditionally, uncertainties in radiation therapy have been handled by [CONTACT_171987](s). For example, a margin applied to the 
clinical target volume (CTV) defines the planning target volume (PTV). These 
margins ensure that there is adequate target dose coverage and at the same time 
that sufficient normal tissue is spared. A feasible approach to reducing toxicity 
while at the same time maintaining similar cure rates is to reduce the margins used 
in radiation treatment planning [5], specifically reduce the CTV to PTV margin. This 
can be achieved by [CONTACT_171988]- beam CT (CBCT) imaging which has shown 
improved patient set -up to approximately 1 mm [16]. Advances in computation and 
technology in radiation therapy have allowed the possibility of integrating set -up 
uncertainties in the optimization process of the dose calculation [17- 21]. This 
probabilistic approach for achieving robust radiation treatment plans take into 
IRB # 217585

Version 9

Page 3 of 21 
 
account set -up uncertainties explicitly in the optimization process by [CONTACT_171989]. A s 
such, as an alternative to the use of biological objectives in the dose optimization 
process, robustness can be used as a tool to minimize dose to normal tissue and 
reduced toxicity leading to better quality of life [5].  
Based on the above, we hypothesize that  robust radiotherapy planning can 
improve the toxicity profile of xerostomia in patients with squamous cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck ( HN-SQCC) compared to margin- based radiotherapy 
planning. However, the amount of improvement to expect remains unknown.   
Therefore, we propose to perform a prospective randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_171979], stratified by [CONTACT_171990], to evaluate the degree of xerostomia and 
quality of life (QOL) in subject s with HN- SQCC treated with  radiation therapy under  
margin- based and  robust radiotherapy treatment plans. Margin- based plans will 
use both biological (biological optimization) and physical objectives whereas 
robust planning will use physical objectives for sparing of the parotid glands. 
Intensity -modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and standard chemotherapy will be 
used. QOL (quality of life) will be measured using the EORTC QLQ- C30 
questionnaire and EORTC QLQ -H&N35  (head and neck ) module before 
radiotherapy  (baseline)  and then 3, 6, [ADDRESS_201753]  before radiotherapy  and then 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months after radiotherapy: the LENT/SOMA grading system and the University of 
Michigan’s  Xerostomia  Questionnaire (XQ ; see Eisbruch et al.  2001) . The data  
collected by [CONTACT_171991][INVESTIGATOR_171980],

methods of radiotherapy planning in the treatment of HN -SQCC.

 Secondary Objectives  
 
1) To compare  descriptively  the arm treated with IMRT under the margin-
based radiotherapy plan to the arm treated with IMRT under the robust 
radiotherapy plan for  possible  differences in derived outcomes  of interest, 
including but not limited to: (1)  occurrence rate of grade≥2 xerostomia as 
determined using the LENT/SOMA scale; and (2) occurrence rate of overall 
score ≥ 30 on the XQ . 
2) To obtain NTCP values of the parotid glands from both margin- based and 
robust radiotherapy treatment plans using validated parameter values of the NTCP mean dose model.  Each subject  will have  their parotid NTCP values 
computed under both plans, even though they will receive IMRT delivered under only the plan they are randomized to.  
3) To obtain dose statistics for dose delivered to the parotid glands  of each 
subjec t via either margin- based or  robust treatment plans.  
4) To determine quality of life (QoL) at baseline and at  3, 6, 9 and 12 months  
following treatment  using the EORTC QLQ -C30 instrument combined with 
the EORTC QLQ-H& N35 module.  The main scores of interest  at each time 
point will be  the global QoL scale and the individual scales for  dry mouth, 
oral pain, swallowing, opening mouth, sticky saliva, and social eating.  
5) To correlate NTCP values with change in QoL results.

xerostomia will be approached using medications that do not stimulate the 
production of saliva. Such drugs include artificial salivas and Biotene oral 
spray. Potential subjects who are currently  using saliva stimulating drugs 
must discontinue the drugs to qualify for the study. A washout period of 3- [ADDRESS_201757] will complete a series of 
questionnaires, including the subjective LENT/SOMA xerostomia form , the 
University of Michigan ’s XQ, and the EORTC QLQ -C30 and H&N35 modules .   
Then the subject will attend their scheduled routine chemotherapy as prescribed 
by [CONTACT_78025].  This will be given concurrently with radiation 
therapy as discussed with the Radiation Oncologist.   
 Following the completion of the scheduled chemo -radiotherapy, the subject 
will be seen in Radiation Oncology every [ADDRESS_201758] s will once again 
complete the packet of questionnaires.  The  EORTC questionnaires and the 
xerostomia assessments (the LENT/SOMA form and the XQ) will also be filled out  
at 3 months (+/ - 30 days) , 6 months (+/ - 30 days) , 9 months (+/ - 30 days)  and 12 
months  (+/- 30 days)  after chemo- radiotherapy . The packet will be completed in 
the clinic, but if necessary can be sent home with the subject  with a return envelope, 
emailed to the subject, or the subject may be called to respond to the questions 
over the phone.  The subject is also to be seen at the discretion of the medical 
oncologist and surgeon as part of routine oncologic follow -up.

Management Analytic (LENT -SOMA) system includes subjective (patient -rated) 
and objectiv e (clinician -rated) indices of radiotherapy toxicities [23].  The patient -
rated xerostomia item is used in the current study.  The item is rated on a 4- point 
Likert scale  with [ADDRESS_201763] validity of this measure 
[22, 23].  The University of Michigan’s  Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ)  is a brief, 8-
item measure of patient -reported xerostomia.  Individual i tems are rated on a 10-
point scale with [ADDRESS_201764] validity, and sensitivity to change [24- 26].

Quality of Life :  The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EORTC) QLQ -C30 [27] is a widely used core module, designed to capture 
multidimensional aspects of health- related quality -of-life across a wide spectrum 
of different malignancies .  It generates a global score, 5 functi onal scores, and 9 
symptom scores.  The H&N35 module [28] assesses concerns specific to head-
and-neck cancer patients; it yields [ADDRESS_201765]

EORTC scales [27 -29]. 
 
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics :  Demographic information will be 
collected at the baseline assessment to record basic background information (e.g., 
age, race, gender, education, comorbidities, etc.).  Clinical variables will be 
obtained from the treatment team or medical record (e.g., stage, site, recurrence 
status, prior treatments, time since diagnosis, etc.) .

Definitions of adverse effects  
 
An adverse event is any unt oward medical occurrence in a subject  
undergoing study assessments and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the assessments. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated w ith the study assessments, whether or not related to the 
assessments.  
Severity of adverse effects  
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The CTCAE v4 is available at

A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any 
untoward medical occurrence that:   
• Results in death.  
o If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
• Is life -threatening.  
o The subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 
24   hours.  
• Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of 
the investigator jeopardizes the subject , may b e considered for reporting as a 
serious adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
development of drug abuse or drug dependency.  
 
Reporting requirements for adverse events  Expedited reporting  • The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] 24 hours of learning of any 
serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study.  
• The UAMS IRB must be notified within 10 business days of “any unanticipated 
problems involvin g risk to subjects or others” (UPR/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]; See UAMS IRB 
Policy 10.2).

LENT/SOMA grading system and the University of Michigan’s Xerostomia 
Questionnaire (XQ; see Eisbruch et al.  2001).  
To accomplish this study’s primary objective, the analysis will proceed as 
follows: To analyze the XQ, scores on its [ADDRESS_201768] 
at each time point to produce an overall XQ score whose values theoretically can 
range from 0 to 80; it will be treated as a continuous variable. LENT/SOMA grades 
as written on the form wil l simply be recorded electronically, and non- integer 
grades will be allowed if that’s what the subject wrote on the form. Longitudinal LENT/ SOMA grades will be summarized by [CONTACT_171992], and also as the mean and SD of grade. Longitudinal overall XQ scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_171993], SD, median, quartiles, and range. Both the 
correlation between xerostomia measures within each time point and th e 
correlation within each xerostomia measure across time points will be studied using Spearman correlation analysis. Estimated means, SDs, medians, and 
quartiles will be accompanied by 90% confidence intervals. In exploratory analysis,

we will employ mixed -models analysis to investigate more deeply the 
interrelationships among the xerostomia measures between treatment arms and 
time points. Also in exploratory analysis to accomplish the primary objective, we 
will use means, SD, and ranges to summarize each of the 8 individual items from 
the XQ by [CONTACT_106865], and investigate using mixed- models 
approaches to compare the XQ items descriptively for treatment -arm differences 
over time.  
This study  also has the following secondary objectives:  
1) To com pare descriptively  the arm treated with IMRT under the margin- based 
radiotherapy plan to the arm treated with IMRT under the robust radiotherapy plan for possible differences in derived outcomes of interest, including but not 
limited to : (1) occurrence rate of grade≥2 xerostomia as determined using the 
LENT/SOMA scale ; and (2) occurrence rate of overall score ≥30 on the XQ . 
2) To obtain NTCP values of the parotid glands from both margin- based and 
robust radiotherapy treatment plans using validated parameter values of the NTCP mean dose model.  Each subject  will have their parotid NTCP values 
computed under both plans, even though they will receive IMRT delivered under only the plan they are randomized to.  
3) To obtain dose statistics for dose delivered to the parotid glands from both margin- based and robust treatment plans.  
4) To determine quality of life (QoL) at baseline and at  3, 6, 9 and 12 months  after 
treatment  using the EORTC QLQ -C30 instrument combined with the EORTC 
QLQ-H& N35 module.  The main scores of interest at each time point will be the 
global QoL scale and the individual scales for dry mouth, oral pain, swallowing, 
opening mouth, sticky saliva, and social eating.  
5) To correlate NTCP values with change in QoL results.

1) Xerostomia grades from the LENT/SOMA scale will be dichotomized as 
grade≥2 versus grade<2, then summarized by [CONTACT_171994]≥2. The dichotomization is placed 
at grade </≥2 because that was the cutpoint used in the PARSPORT study [22], 
but we will also consider an alternative dichotomization at grade </≥3.   As f or 
the overall XQ score (a continuous variable) , we will dichotomize it at different 
cutpoints chosen for their potential clinical relevance, beginning with a cutpoint of </≥ 30, then summarize the result  by [CONTACT_171995]. For all 
dichotomized versions of both xerostomia measures, the  proportions on each 
arm and proportion differences between treatment arms will be estimated at 
each time point. Estimated proportions and their  differences will be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_1192]- sided 90% confidence intervals. Exploratory mixed-
models analysis may be used in follow -up mode, as time permits,  to explore 
more deeply the differences between treatment arm s and how they change 
over time .    
2) NTCP values from both plans will be summarized by [CONTACT_171996], SD, median, quartiles, and range. Data will be graphed using box 
plots versus treatment arm.  Plans will be compared descriptively by [CONTACT_171997], and summarizing the result as means, SDs, and ranges. Means will be accompanied by 90% confidence limits.  
3) Dose statistics on each subject  (i.e., the mean, SD, median, [ADDRESS_201769] ) will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_171998], SD, median, quartiles, 
and range. Data for each statistics will be graphed using box plots versus

between t reatment arms will be estimated  at each time point, and such 
estimates  will be accompanied by [CONTACT_1192]- sided 90% confidence intervals . 
Exploratory mixed- models analysis may be used in follow -up mode , as time 
permits,  to explore more deeply the differences between treatment arms and 
how they change over time.  
5) Changes in QoL results after treatment (compared to baseline) will be 
calculated at each post -treatment time point, then assessed for correlation with 
NTCP values by [CONTACT_172000].  
 
For analyses in support of the secondary objectives , the outcomes at all time 
points will be  of interest, but outcomes at the 12-month time point will be of special

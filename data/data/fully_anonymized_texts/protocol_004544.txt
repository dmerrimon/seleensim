CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are global 
public health issues closely associated with the worldwide epi[INVESTIGATOR_248413].1-3 
NAFLD encompasses the spectrum of liver disease in patients with no significant alcohol consumption ranging from fatty liver to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis.
1 Nonalcoholic fatty liver 
(NAFL) is characterized by [CONTACT_248441] (hepatic steatosis) with no evidence of hepatocellular injury in the form of ballooning of hepatocytes or no evidence of cirrhosis.
1 The risk for progression to cirrhosis and liver failure in these patients is minimal. 
NASH is defined by [CONTACT_248442] (ballooning) with or without cirrhosis.
[ADDRESS_302013] cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries with as high as 30% of the general population affected.
2, 4 In newly identified cases of 
chronic liver disease in a US survey, 39% had NAFLD.2 A high prevalence of NASH among 
NAFLD cases has been reported2: up to 55% in patients with elevated aminotransferases5, 6, as 
high as 49% in morbidly obese patients7, 8, and 67% in a subset of patients with incident chronic 
liver disease.[ADDRESS_302014] a BMI 
greater than 25 kg/m2.12 Primary NAFLD/NASH is associated with insulin resistance (IR) and its 
phenotypic manifestations. There are clear relationships between NAFLD and obesity13 and 
between NAFLD and diabetes independent of obesity.14 Systemic IR is considered to be the key 
risk factor for development of NAFLD.15  
The close relationship between NAFLD/NASH and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_248414]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_248415], no safe and effective treatment is currently available.
16 
Management strategies for NAFLD/NASH rely primarily on non-pharmacologic measures. Since 
patients with NAFLD without steatohepatitis have excellent prognoses from a liver standpoint, treatments aimed at improving liver disease should be limited to those w ith NASH.
1  
Life-style modifications are effective but adherence is difficult to maintain.17 Bariatric surgery 
can be performed in selective obese patients, but is too drastic to be the treatment of choice and thus it is not recommended for treating NASH.
18 Vitamin E has been effective in treating 
nondiabetic NASH patients without cirrhosis.19 The long-term safety and efficacy of pi[INVESTIGATOR_248416].20, 21 Metformin22, ursodeoxycholic acid, omega 3 fatty acids, and statins

TYPE 2 DIABETES and NAFLD/NASH  
Type [ADDRESS_302015] an endogenous resistance to insulin. The disease appears when they fail to

Phase 2 Clinical Study Final; Version 2 ; Dated: August 25, 2020 Page 17 of 62  
CONFIDENTIAL  manufacture sufficient insulin levels to overcome this resistance. This relative lack of insulin 
eventually leads to chronic hyperglycemia. 
Traditionally, type 2 was known as “adult-onset diabetes” (with type 1 being referred to as 
“juvenile-onset” diabetes) as it generally struck adults, usually overweight, of age 45 and over. However, in recent years, the incidence of type 2 DM has skyrocket ed—to the extent that it is 
now being termed a global “pandemic.” Type 2 DM is strongly correlated with obesity, and so this disproportionate increase is considered a reflection of the twin ills of modern life—overeating/obesity and decreased physical activity. 
The 2014 CDC National Diabetes Statistics Report estimated that 29.1 million people or 9.3% of 
the US population have diabetes; 21 million diagnosed and 8.1 million undiagnosed.
23 Another 
86 million (37% of US adults aged 20 years and older) people were estimated to suffer from pre-diabetes, a condition that increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746] 2 DM—the more common form of the disease— as well as heart disease and stroke.  
Comparable statistics may be found in both developed and developi[INVESTIGATOR_248417]. Global prevalence of diabetes is now estimated at more than 380 million, or about 8% of the worldwide adult population according to the International Diabetes Federation. Type 2 DM represents 85-95% of both present and future cases.
24 
As noted above, the prevalence of NAFLD can be as high as 90–95% in obese individuals and up to 70% of patients with type [ADDRESS_302016] decade, several major studies (DCCT, [LOCATION_006]PDS and others) have focused attention on 
the need for strict control of glycemia to prevent and/or reduce the risk of both the specific microvascular and the less specific macrovascular complications.
26,[ADDRESS_302017] themselves sever al times each day throughout their entire lives. Injections are 
painful, inconvenient, and frightening for many patients. Over time reluctance to carry out injections increases, and many patients become non-adherent to therapy.

continuous metabolic regulation that occurs normally with insulin secreted from the pancreas directly into the liver via the portal vein.  
An ideal solution for treating these diabetics would be to transplant healthy insulin producing cells (pancreatic islets) into the patient. However, direct transplantation has not yet been practical. The immune system of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_248418]. The side effects of drugs necessary to suppress the immune system are too severe to justify their use in otherwise healthy patients. 
Consequently, research is underway to develop a new and different approach that would both 
improve the administration of insulin and provide a way by [CONTACT_248443] a physiological manner, namely, oral administration of insulin. 
 ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF INSULIN  
Insulin injections are, intrinsically unpleasant and patients may cease to perform them, leading to 
a multitude of possible complications. In addition, subcutaneous injection is not the most physiologically efficient mode of insulin transfer to the body. H ence, the search for an oral form 
of insulin has been underway since Banting and Best’s discovery of insulin in 1922. Oral insulin would free patients of the pain and inconvenience of injections while providing a more physiologically advantageous route of administration.  
Proposed Mechanism  
Any attempt to develop an oral insulin modality must take into account two major obstacles that result from insulin’s biochemical characteristics as a polypeptide: 1) Its direct transfer across the mucosal barrier is restricted; 2) it is subject to degrada tion by [CONTACT_248444].  
To overcome these barriers, Oramed has proposed a mechanism to prevent the digestion of the 
introduced hormone in the gastrointestinal tract and to facilitate its physiological absorption. After performance of a range of studies for optimization of co- factors to prevent the digestion of 
insulin, Oramed has identified the most efficacious formulation of encapsulated oral insulin. The proposed composition contains: (1) crystalline insulin, (2) EDTA as enhancer, (3) soybean trypsin (SBTI), and (4) omega 3- rich fish oil, in a coated capsule. These components are 
expanded upon in greater detail below. Each has a target function, which promotes the goals of our treatment modality. The chelating agent EDTA functions as an effective enhancer of the mixture. The SBTI prevents enzymatic degradation of the insulin by [CONTACT_248445].

ORAL INSULIN FOR NAFLD/NASH  
The similarities between type 2 DM and NAFLD/NASH in risk factors, pathogenic mechanisms 
and complications suggest common approaches to therapeutic intervention. Recall that 70% of type 2 DM patients will develop NAFLD/NASH and that 85% of new cases of diabetes will be type 2 patients. The key component of insulin resistance shared by [CONTACT_248448]/NASH makes direct insulin intervention an attractive option. The oral insulin formulation has the potential advantage of first pass metabolism in the liver allowing local availability and concentration of insulin at the affected liver fat cells.  
 
ORAL INSULIN DEMONSTRATIONS OF EFFICACY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES  
Oramed’s  research and development team has performed multiple studies on pi[INVESTIGATOR_248419]. The studies were designed to optimize the composition and functionality of 
our oral insulin modality and to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for use in animals and humans.

CONFIDENTIAL  3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a  double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multi-center study using the oral 
ORMD-0801 insulin formulation in patients with NASH and confirmed type 2 DM. This 
exploratory multi- center  study will enroll patients with NASH and type 2 DM between the ages 
of 18 and 70. Subjects will undergo a S creening  Phase up to 42 days prior to the T reatment 
Phase, a Placebo Run-in Phase for 2 weeks, a T reatment Phase for 12 weeks and an  End-of-
Study P hase 4 weeks after completion of the Treatment  Phase. Approximately 36 subjects  will 
be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 8 mg ORMD-0801, 1 capsule twice a day (once in the morning approximately [ADDRESS_302020] and no later than 10 AM, and once at night between 8 PM to Midnight and no sooner than 1 hour after dinner) or matching placebo .   
At Screening  (Visit 1, up to week -6), subjects will sign the ICF and inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be reviewed . Medical history, demographics (sex, age, race and ethnicity), and  prior 
and concomitant medication s will be recorded. Height and weight will be measured, and BMI 
will be calculated. Vital signs ( SBP/DBP,  heart rate and oral temperature), complete physical 
examination, 12- Lead ECG , clinical laboratory evaluations, serum  pregnancy test  for females of 
childbearing potential, blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_248420], HbA1c, viral serology, CAP -Fibroscan and MRI- PDFF 
will be perf ormed . For females of non-childbearing potential, FSH levels will be tested if results 
are not available . Adverse events will be monitored and recorded.  
After Screening, each subject  will undergo a P lacebo Run-in Phase (Visit 2, to W eek - 2). 
Concomitant medications  will be reviewed. All subjects will receive the morning treatment 
(Run-in P lacebo)  in clinic,  [ADDRESS_302021] diaries will be dispensed. 
Vital signs ( SBP/DBP,  heart rate and oral temperature) and weight will be collected. Fasting 
blood glucose and fasting insulin will be measured, urine pregnancy test will be performed  for 
females of childbearing potential. Self -monitored fasting morning blood glucose (finger- stick) 
will be recorded in the patient diaries [ADDRESS_302022] ing of a treatment period of 12 weeks that 
will start at V isit 3 ( Week 0) and outpatient visits at W eeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (final visit). At each 
visit, concomitant medication  will be reviewed , weight will be measured , and sufficient quantity 
of medication will be dispensed to last until the next nominal clinic visit. Medication compliance 
check will be performed, self -monitored fasting morning blood glucose (finger- stick) will be 
recorded 3 days weekly in the morning and subjects’ diaries will be reviewed. Vital signs 
(SBP/DBP,  heart rate and oral temperature) will be recorded. Adverse events will be monitored 
and recorded . ORMD -[ADDRESS_302023] HbA1c evaluations and MRI- PDFF  performed. At Visits 3 and 8, a 
complete physical exam  and CAP -Fibroscan will be performed.

CONFIDENTIAL  At Visits 3 (baseline), 6, 7, and 8, patients will have clinical laboratory evaluations ( serum 
chemistry, hematology) and blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_248421] . Fasting blood glucose, insulin (also used for 
HOMA estimates)  and adiponectin levels will be measured.  
The End-of-Study ( EOS ) Visit (Visit 9) will be conducted [ADDRESS_302024] scheduled 
treatment visit. Subjects  concomitant medications will be reviewed , and weight will be 
measured . A complete physical exam and ECG will be performed and vital signs ( SBP/DBP,  
heart rate and oral temperature) will be measured if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. 
Clinical laboratory evaluation s [serum chemistry  (including liver function tests (LFTs) and blood 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] ) and hematology] will be performed. Fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c and 
adiponectin levels will be measured. Subject diaries will be collected and reviewed for self -
monitored fasting morning blood glucose. Adverse events will be monitored and recorded. Subjects  who are discontinued early from the study will complete the EOS evaluations at the 
time of early discontinuation. 
3.2 Screening/Visit 1 (up to Week -6, up to -42 Days) 
At the S creening  Visit, potential subjects will be given a detailed oral presentation describing the 
nature, purpose, risks, and requirements of the study and will receive detailed written information . Subjects will be given ample time to consider participation and ask questions which 
will be adequately addressed by [CONTACT_8786]. 
Once the subject is satisfied that he/she is willing to participate in the study, he/she will be a sked 
to sign the study informed consent form (ICF) (refer to Section 11.1.4 for further detail regarding 
the ICF). The investigational site  personnel obtaining written consent from the subject will also 
sign the form to confirm consent has been obtained.  
Once signed, the Investigator will retain the original ICF for the subject’s study records and 
provide the subject with a signed copy. The investigator will verify that informed consent has been obtained from each subject prior to enrollment into the study and prior to the subject undergoing any study-related procedures.

Unscheduled Visit for a repeat measurement of fasting blood glucose and any necessary clinical safety laboratory assessments , if the investigator deems it necessary. AEs/SAEs assessment will 
also be performed.  
3.7 Self-Monitoring Fasting Blood Glucose and Patient Diaries 
All patients will self -monitor fasting morning blood glucose levels three (3) times weekly during 
the run-in and treatment period. Monitoring must be performed at the same time each designated day (± 10 minutes) prior any caloric intake. Patients will be required to record the values in a patient diary and bring the diary to each clinic visit. Information recorded for the fasting blood glucose will be reviewed by [CONTACT_248449] (e CRF ). During the study, both fasting finger stick glucose and 
laboratory fasting plasma glucose will be obtained. 
If a fasting blood glucose measures greater than or equal to 270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L) during daily 
self-monitoring or during any in- clinic visit, the patient will be required to contact [CONTACT_248450]. The patient may be required to return for an unscheduled visit to the clinic for a repeat measurement of fasting blood glucose within one week after the original measurement. If 
Oramed Ltd.   Protocol No.: ORA-D- N02 
Phase 2 Clinical Study Final; Version 2 ; Dated: August 25, 2020 Page 29 of 62  
CONFIDENTIAL  the patient is invited for an unscheduled visit, blood will be drawn and sent to lab for plasma 
glucose determination. If the repeat measurement is also greater than or equal to 270 mg/dL, the 
patient will be discontinued from treatment with study drug and offered rescue medication. The patient will continue to be seen for all remaining study visits, if possible. 
If a fasting blood glucose value is <70 mg/dL, the patient should drink [ADDRESS_302035] all blood glucose levels in the diary.  
If three or more fingerstick glucose values of <50 mg/dL (2.78 mmol/L) are observed within 12 
hours subsequent to administration of study drug without a reasonable explanation (such as increased physical activity and/or skipped meal), the patient will be discontinued from t reatment 
with study drug and rescued with glucose administration (20g of glucose tablets) which will be available at all times at the study site. This information will be recorded in the patient’s diary and the patient will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_248451]. The patient will continue to be seen for all remaining study visits. 
Sites will instruct patients to immediately perform a finger stick glucose measurement if any 
symptoms occur that may be related to hypoglycemia (e.g., weakness, dizziness, shakiness, increased sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or confusion), and to avoid delay in treating these symptoms.  The measurements will be recorded in the patient diary. Patients will always carry glucose tablets with them and ingests 3 -4 tablets if hypoglycemia occurs. 
Hypoglycemia and associated symptoms (e.g., weakness, dizziness, shakiness, increased sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or confusion), have been associated with insulin administration, including ORMD-0801.

Subjects  who withdraw from the study prior t o treatment may be replaced. Subjects  who are 
withdrawn and have received at least one treatment will not be replaced. Subjects  who 
discontinue study drug treatment will not be replaced. 
Except in cases of emergency, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor and the Medical 
Monitor before removing the subject from the study. In some circumstances it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs that may have an unclear relationship to the IMP. The Investigator should obtain approval from the Sponsor and Medical Monitor before 
restarting IMPs that were temporarily discontinued for an AE. 
In the event that a subject discontinues the study prior to completion, the date the subject is withdrawn and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF. Although a subject will not be obliged to give his/her reason for withdrawing 
prematurely, the Investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the subject’s rights.   
All subjects who are randomized and treated (i.e., received any amount of IMP) will be included 
in the safety analyses. Thus, every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_248452].   Protocol No.: ORA-D- N02

subject withdraws from the study as a result of meeting discontinuation criteria after the start of 
IMP administration, reasonable efforts should be made to have the subject return for the early 
withdrawal  evaluations ( Section 3.5). Any subject withdrawn due to a suspected IMP related AE 
should be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. 
If a subject becomes pregnant, IMP  will be discontinued immediately, and the subject will be 
referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling. The subject will be followed until delivery or other termination of pregnancy for outcome. 
Subjects may choose to withdraw authorization to use and disclose their PHI as defined by [CONTACT_248453]. Such withdrawal of authorization must be made to the Investigator in writing. Any PHI collected by [CONTACT_248454]. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study, and the Investigator/Investigational Site has the 
right to close the site, at any time, although this should occur only after consultation between involved parties. The Investigator or representative will notify the IRB in writing of a premature 
termination of a study or closure of Investigational Site or of a temporary halt of the study, including the reason of such an action and will send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor.   
Events that may trigger premature termination of a study or closure of an Investigational Site 
include, but are not limited to , a new toxicity finding, a request to discontinue the trial from a 
regulatory authority, non-compliance with the protocol, GCP violations, slow recruitment /low 
enrollment, or change in development plans for the IMP. 
If either of the criteria listed below is met, enrollment of new subjects and dosing of ongoing subjects will be temporarily stopped. The Investigator, Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will discuss whether a lower dose or any additional treatment guidelines should be implemented, or if the trial should be permanently stopped. Any proposed changes to the protocol to address such findings will be submitted for review and approval by [CONTACT_4158] U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) prior to re -starting the trial.

All medications and supplements (other than IMP) taken by [CONTACT_248458] 1 through 
Visit 8 assessment s will be considered “concomitant” medications and supplements.  
Medications and supplements taken prior to Visit 1 that are no longer being taken at Visit 1 will be considered “prior” medications and supplements. 
Medications and supplements should be recorded according to the generic name [CONTACT_248484].  
The use of c oncomitant medications and supplements should be limited to those that are 
medically necessary. Any medication  or supplement used should have an indication recorded, 
and for concomitant medications and supplements, this indication must be represented as either 
for the treatment of an AE, for the management of a pre-existing condition, or for prophylaxis.  
Dosage increases for any concomitant medication  or supplement should be noted and the reason 
for the dosage increase recorded as an  AE (assumes worsening condition). The side effects of 
concomitant medications will be recorded as AE s.  
Any subject whose condition becomes disqualifying during the course of the study may be 
treated for that condition. If the condition is suspected during S creening , the subject should not 
be enrolled. Treatment of the condition should be instituted according to the Investigator’s/attending physician's judgment.  
Medications that have no treatment intent but rather are part of supportive routine care such as 
local anesthetics, intravenous solutions to maintain fluid balance and keep access open, medications used for prophylaxis, and narcotics for postsurgical pain must also be recorded in the subject’s medical record and e CRF .

7.3.1  Adverse Events of Hypoglycemia  
The CTCAE (version 5.0) criteria for mild, moderate, and severe hypoglycemia based on blood glucose will be used, as shown below: 
Mild: < 70 – 55 mg/dL (< 3.8 - 3.0 mmol/L)

Severe: < 40 – 30 mg/dL (< 2.2 - 1.7 mmol/L) Life Threatening: < 30 mg/dL (< 1.7 mmol/L) 
7.4 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines define a serious adverse event 
(SAE) as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life -threatening.

CONFIDENTIAL  • Requires or prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but that may jeopardize the patient or require medical intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes, should also be considered serious when based upon the Investigator’s medical judgment.  
Events not to be reported as SAEs are the following:  
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition. 
• Treatment, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], which was elective or pre-planned for a pre-existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen. 
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
aforementioned definitions of “serious” and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
7.[ADDRESS_302068] be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF from the time of patient consent until completion 
of patients End-of-Study V isit (Visit 9). All serious adverse events will be collected through 
Visit 9. The Investigator must continue to follow all non-serious events possibly related to the study medication and all serious adverse events until they resolve or until the Investigator assesses them in writing as chronic or stable.   
Regardless of relationship to study medication, the event must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Adverse event documentation should include the following information: 
• Standard medical terminology for the AE  
• Description of adverse event 
• Date and time of onset  
• Date and time of resolution of the adverse event  
• Whether or not the event is ongoing 
• Severity of the event  
• Relationship between the adverse event and the investigational product 
• Description of any actions taken (e.g., medications, treatments) 
• Outcome of the AE 
• Whether or not the effect was serious and/or unanticipated  
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be given when signs and symptoms are due to common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]"). For the purposes of this study, hypoglycemic events will be considered adverse events and should be recorded in source and eCRF records.  
When a diagnosis is not available, each adverse event should be reported separately. For

7.6.1  Potential Adverse Events Associated with ORMD -0801 
Hypoglycemia and associated symptoms (e.g., weakness, dizziness, shakiness, increased 
sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or confusion), have been associated with insulin administration, including ORMD-0801.  Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with OR MD-0801. It is not

will be assessed according to the following scale: 
Mild – events are usually transient and easily tolerated, requiring no special treatment and causing 
no disruption of the subject’s normal daily activities. 
Moderate  – events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may 
interfere with daily activities but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]. Moderate 
experiences may cause some interference with functioning.  
Severe  – events interrupt the subject’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. They are usually incapacitating. 
7.8 Expectedness of Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32(a) as follows: 
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current applic ation, as amended.

CONFIDENTIAL  7.9 Assessment of Adverse Event Outcome 
Outcome of AEs will be defined according to ICH Topic E2B, ICH Guideline. 
• Recovered/Resolved:  The subject has recovered fully from the AE without any 
remaining effects or impairment.  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae:  The subject has recovered, but with an after effect 
possibly due to disease or treatment. 
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved:  The condition is still present.  
• Fatal: Fatal should only be used when death is possibly related to the AE.  
• Unknown:  The primary outcome is not known at the time of the final assessment. If an 
outcome for an AE is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up will proceed 
until an outcome is known or followed up to the Final Study Visit. Any subject with a 
possible IMP -related AE at the Final Study Visit will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the event. Further, any SAE, whether or not related to IMP (active or 
Placebo ), that occurs within [ADDRESS_302075] dose of IMP will be  followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the event. 
7.10 Clinical Findings  
Any significant clinical findings at Visit 9 will be followed until the condition returns to pre-study status, stabilizes, or can be explained as not being IMP  related. If the clinical finding is 
reported as an AE (per the criteria outlined in Section  7.2), the follow-up procedures for AEs 
defined above will apply.

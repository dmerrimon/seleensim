 Planned relocation to a state other than current st ate of residence 
during the study if virtual clinic is not licensed in the new state. 
Individuals working routinely in a state other than  current state of 
residence in the next six months are also ineligibl e if the virtual 
clinic is not licensed in that state.  
Sample Size The recruitment target is 300  initiating CGM .  
Outcomes Efficacy Outcomes: CGM use; CGM metrics for hypoglycemia (<54 and 
<70 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (>180 and >250 mg/dL), ti me in range (70-
180 mg/dL), mean glucose, and glycemic variability (coefficient of 
variation); HbA1c; participant- reported outcomes i ncluding psychosocial 
and diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaires 
Safety Outcomes: Severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , and emergency room visits  
Participant Duration Study participation will be up to 12 months.  
Protocol Overview/Synopsis 
 Patient Population 
Adults ≥ [ADDRESS_980158] information for 
the participant’s diabetes healthcare provider will  also be collected. 
 
HbA1c 
Participant will receive fingerstick HbA1c kits tha t will be sent to a 
central lab for measurement after enrollment and at  [ADDRESS_980159] the virtual clinic as needed.  
 
CGM Use 
Participants who do not currently use a CGM will us e a blinded CGM 
device for a single sensor wear period prior to CGM  initiation. 
Participants may be asked to use a blinded CGM for an additional sensor 
wear period(s) if enough CGM data are not available  to establish a 
baseline that can be used as baseline comparator da ta. Current CGM users 
will be asked to share their CGM data to confirm th at they meet study 
eligibility criteria and to establish a baseline th at can be used as baseline 
comparator data. Virtual training will include CGM set up, sensor 
insertion, alerts and alarms, uploading data, and v isualizing data.

 P AGE 10  OF 28 Chapter 1: Background Information 4 
1.1  Introduction 5 
The advent of home blood glucose meter (BGM) testin g from a fingerstick in the 1980s had a [ADDRESS_980161] people with diabetes, continuous 8 
glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are now available and have replaced BGM testing for 9 
primary glucose monitoring in an increasing number of adults and children with type 1 diabetes 10 
(T1D) and some with type 2 diabetes (T2D). 11 
The CGM device has a sensor that is inserted in the  subcutaneous space and measures the 12 
interstitial fluid glucose concentration. Some CGMs , such as the Dexcom G6, provide real-time 13 
glucose measurements every five minutes with alerts  for rising or droppi[INVESTIGATOR_718444] 14 
threshold alarms when a preset hyperglycemia or hyp oglycemia level is reached. Other CGMs 15 
such as the Abbott FreeStyle Libre, which also has been referred to as flash glucose monitoring, 16 
show glucose levels only when the user passes the r eceiver over the sensor to transmit the 17 
glucose data to the receiver; glucose recordings ar e every 15 minutes. 18 
The accuracy of current generation CGMs approaches that of blood glucose meters. For the 19 
current generation of the Dexcom and Abbott sensor,  the mean absolute relative difference, a 20 
common metric for assessing accuracy when sensor gl ucose values are compared with reference 21 
glucose values, is about 10% or lower, which is in about the middle of the range of accuracy of 22 
current blood glucose meters 1,2 . This accuracy is what led the FDA to approve the device for 23 
non-adjunctive use in dosing insulin. 24 
The efficacy of CGM has been demonstrated in random ized trials of adults and youth with type 1 25 
diabetes (T1D) 3-10 , adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using insulin 11-13 , and in a registry of adults 26 
and youth with T1D 14 ; including reductions in HbA1c levels, duration of  hyperglycemia and 27 
hypoglycemia, and increased time spent with glucose  levels between 70 and 180 mg/dL, which is 28 
the target range. Studies not only demonstrated imp rovement in HbA1c and reduction in 29 
hypoglycemia but also showed that after six months,  approximately 90% of individuals were [ADDRESS_980162] demonstrated the benefits of CGM in in dividuals with T1D or T2D treated with 33 
multiple daily injections of insulin 3,5,6,9,15,16 . In the T1D Exchange registry, CGM use 34 
(predominately Dexcom) was associated with lower Hb A1c levels irrespective of whether a 35 
pump or injections are used for insulin delivery. M ean HbA1c was 9.1% in individuals not using 36 
a pump or CGM, 8.6% in those using a pump but not a  CGM, 7.9% in those using both a pump 37 
and CGM, and 8.0% in those using injections and CGM . [ADDRESS_980163] participants, 60 
as well as a reduction in estimated mean glucose, w ith an increase in the amount of time in range 61 
spent with glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dL,  which is the generally accepted target [ADDRESS_980164] adults with T1D or T2D (excluding pr egnancy) [ADDRESS_980165] the HbA1c sample could c ause bruising and/or pain at the collection [ADDRESS_980166] the ir origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 112

recommendation. After a CGM system is selected, the  participant may be asked why that system 218 
was selected. 219 
2.7  Blinded CGM 220 
Non-CGM users will use a blinded CGM device for a s ingle sensor wear period (usually at least 221 
10 days) prior to CGM initiation. Current CGM users  will be asked to use a blinded CGM device [ADDRESS_980174] a serious skin reaction to the sensor during b linded CGM wear that precludes continued use 234 
of a sensor will be dropped. If additional FDA-appr oved CGM options are available for use in 235 
this study, the participant may be offered the oppo rtunity to try the other CGM system; in this 236 
case blinded data collection would be repeated with  another system. 237 
2.8  Psychosocial Screening Questionnaires  238 
Separate from the patient-reported outcome question naires, psychosocial screening 239 
questionnaires are administered to study participan ts 4 times during the study: as part of baseline 240 
data collection and 1, 2, and 3 months after unblin ded CGM initiation. These screening 241 
questionnaires are validated tools to evaluate depr ession, diabetes distress, and hypoglycemia 242 
fears. Questionnaire administration is repeated to ensure that the virtual clinic team delivering 243 
diabetes care is aware of any mental health issues that may make diabetes management harder 244 
for the study participant. An elevated score on any  of these questionnaires prompts an automated 245 
alert to the virtual clinic team (See section 3.2). [ADDRESS_980175] with a virtual 267 
clinic team member may be requested by [CONTACT_718450]. 268 
In addition, the virtual clinical team member will follow up with the study participant if there is 269 
an elevated score on the psychosocial screening que stionnaires (section 2.8). The virtual clinic [ADDRESS_980176]. Follow up communica tion with a personal healthcare provider is at 273 
the discretion of the virtual clinic for any issues  which may require additional support. 274 
The virtual clinic team member(s) may interact with  the participant through texts, emails, phone 275 
calls and/or virtual training sessions. Phone calls  may be recorded. Additional mobile 276 
applications may be required to facilitate communic ations between participant and virtual clinic 277 
team member(s) depending on program enrollment. 278 
3.2.1  Virtual Clinic Team Interactions with Personal Heal thcare Provider 279 
Communications will be provided to the health care provider whom the participant designates for 280 
diabetes management, so that the provider is aware of the participant’s study participation and of 281 
information related to care or treatment (See secti on 3.5.2). 282

diabetes-related educational information recommende d by [CONTACT_3476]. Live webinars may be 287 
available for those who want to receive additional education about diabetes management and use 288 
of CGM technology. 289 
A virtual training session will be arranged with th e participant’s virtual clinic team member to 290 
answer questions regarding CGM set up, sensor inser tion, alerts and alarms, uploading data, and 291 
visualizing data. 292 
3.4  CGM Use and Data Interpretation 293 
After the initial training to initiate CGM use, par ticipants will receive additional training on how 294 
to use data visualization tools and how to use the CGM data to make self-management changes 295 
in insulin dosing, meals, exercise, etc. The traini ng approach may vary by [CONTACT_4317]’ age 296 
and/or comfort with technology. [ADDRESS_980178] virtual clinic team review of all 308

participant via the app or device. Mallya is an inv estigational device, and it is classified as a 332 
Non-Significant Risk device by [CONTACT_1034]. 333 
An app that is needed to transfer data from the dev ice used to log insulin dose will be installed 334 
on the participant’s personal smartphone. Participa nts will be trained on use of the device and 335 
app as needed. If a device that automatically logs insulin dose is not available, the participant 336 
may be asked to enter insulin doses directly throug h an app.  337

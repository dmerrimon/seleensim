ABSTRACT  
The prognosis of patients with recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma remains poor, with  10-year overall 
survival rates around 20% . Given the continued poor prognosis in this group of patients, novel t reatment 
strategies are needed.  There are no standard chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_293821].  Glycoprotein non -metastatic B ( GPNMB ) is a type I 
transmembrane glycoprotein  that is normally expressed in a variety of cell types including osteoblasts and 
osteoclasts, dendritic cells, macrophages, hematopoietic cells, melanocytes and keratinoc ytes. Aberrant and 
over expression of GPNMB has been demonstrated in a variety of cancers  including  osteosarcoma . GPNMB 
is predominantly expressed on the cell surface of malignant cells, whereas in normal tissues it is generally 
restricted to intracellular  compartments. This unique expression pattern makes GPNMB an attractive target 
for antibody drug conjugate  (ADC ) targeted therapy.  CDX -[ADDRESS_357913] GPNMB. It is 
comprised of a fully -human IgG2 monoclonal antibody (CR011) conjugated to the  potent microtubule 
inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) , via a protease -sensitive valine -citrulline peptide linker and p -
aminobenzoic acid (PABA) spacer.  CDX -[ADDRESS_357914] anti -tumor activity in osteosarcoma. In this Phase 2 study, eligible patients between 
the ages of 12 months and 50 years with unresected, recurrent or refractory osteosarcoma will receive CDX -
011, administered once every 21 days for up to 14  months . Progression free survival and response to therapy 
will be assessed. In addition, the tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of CDX -011 will be 
evaluated .

2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
The outcome of patients with newly di agnosed, localized osteosarcoma improved 
following the addition of multi -agent chemotherapy to complete surgical resection.1,2 
Current results in contemporary cooperative group studies reveal 3 -year event -free survival 
(EFS) ranging between 50 -75%.3-[ADDRESS_357917] chemotherapy includes the use of these two agents alone5,11 or in 
combin ation  with high -dose methotrexate6,12 and/or ifosfamide.4,12-14 The prognosis is poor 
for the 30 -40% of patients who develop recurren t disease ,15 as well as  for those with 
clinically detectable metastases at the time of initial diagnosis6,13,16 with 2 -year survival  
rates of 20 -30%.4,6,13,16-21  
 
The aggrega te EFS for patients with recurrent osteosarcoma enrolled on seven closed Phase 
2 studies from the COG or its predecessor groups is poo r, with an overall 12% EFS at 
4 months [95% CI: 6.0% -19%].  
 
Due to the lack of progress seen in treatment of osteosarcoma over the past 25 years and 
overall poor prognosis for children, adolescents and young adults with recurrent or 
refractory osteosarcoma, novel treatment strategies are needed.

CDX -011 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) directed against Glycoprotein non -
metastatic B.  The preclinical data  that establishes the rationale for proceeding with a Phase 
2 evaluation in patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma  is described below .  
 
Glycoprotein non -metastatic B (GPNMB) as a therapeutic target:  GPNMB (also known 
as osteoactivin, dendritic cell -heparin integrin ligand, or hematopoietic growth factor 
inducible neurokinin -1 type) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein22-[ADDRESS_357918] cancer, glioma and 
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.23,25-30,32,33,40 GPNMB is predominantly expressed on 
the surface of malignant cells, where as in normal tissues it is generally restricted to 
intracellular compartments. This unique expression pattern makes GPNMB an attractive 
target for ADC targeted therapy.25,27,32,39-42  
 
CDX -011: CDX -011 consists of a fully -human IgG2 monoclonal antibody (CR011) 
conjugated to the potent microtubule inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a 
protease -sensitive valine -citrulline peptide linker and p -aminobenzoic acid (PABA) 
spacer. CDX -011 is theorized  to exert its antitumor activity by [CONTACT_293844] -expressing tumor cells. After intravenous (IV) 
administration, CDX -[ADDRESS_357919] cancer and melanoma trials, making CDX -011 an attractive agent for Phase 
2 testing in patients with osteosarcoma.  A positive result in this study in addition to the 
results of other planned studies of CDX -011 will help inform the design of future clinical 
trials for patients with osteosarcoma.  
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies   
The activi ty of CDX -011 in pediatric tumors was recently investigated through the 
Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. GPNMB gene expression was evaluated in  a variety 
of solid tumor and leukemia  xenograft models. Given the  consistent expression of GPNMB 
in the o steosarcoma xenografts , the in vivo  anti-tumor activity was investigated in 6 female 
CB-17SC mice bearing osteosarcoma. The mice received  2.5 mg/kg of CDX -011 IV 
weekly for 3 doses, followed by 3 weeks of observation. Complete tumor responses were 
seen in  3/[ADDRESS_357920] GPNMB -expressing osteosarcoma xenograft had

tolerability of this dose, 1.88 mg/kg rounded to 1.9 mg/kg, the first six children aged less 
than 18 years (‘younger patients’) who enroll on the trial will receive protocol  therapy  with 
close toxicity monitoring. Accrual of younger patients will temporarily be suspended after 
the sixth such patient is enrolled and these patients will be followed  to ensure that there are 
not unanticipated toxicities. Accrual w ill resume at this dose if fewer than one -third of 
toxicity evaluable patients  experience a DLT. We w ill continue to monitor closely for 
toxicities , as we do with all active COG Phase [ADDRESS_357923] 6 evaluable patient s 14 years of age or

COG sites : This number i s obtained via the COG Registry system once 
authorization for the release of protected health information (PHI) has been 
obtained. The COG patient ID number is used to identify the patient in all future 
interactions with COG. If you have problems with the registration, please refer to 
the online help.   
 
Non-COG sites : Fax the patient registration information (demography) to the 
Cancer Trials Support Unit ( CTSU ) registrar at [PHONE_5259] . Sites may notify 
the registration office of an incoming fax by [CONTACT_3379] 1888 -462-3009; the office 
hours are 9:00 – 5:30 pm Eastern Time, Monday – Friday. The CTSU registrar will 
then register the patient within the COG system on behalf of the institution and 
obtain a COG patient ID number. The CTSU registrar will provide the COG patient 
ID number to the site which can then enroll the patient in the OPEN system.  
 
A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as par t of the registration 
process. Each patient will be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION   
6.1 CDX -011 
(GLEMBATUMUMAB VEDOTIN , CR011 -vcMMAE) NSC#  763737 , IND#  128248   
                    (09/01/16 ) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
CDX -011 is an antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a fully -human IgG 2 
monoclonal antibody (CR011) directed against glycoprotein NMB ( GPNMB) and 
conjugated to the tubulin -binding cytotoxic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via a 
protease -sensitive valine -citrulline linker and p -aminobenzoic acid (PABA) spac er. The 
average MMAE: antibody molar ratio is approximately 4.5:1. The antibody is 
manufactured by [CONTACT_293851] (CHO) cell culture, and the drug -linker 
combination vcMMAE is manufactured by [CONTACT_293852].  
 
The proposed mechanism of action of  CDX -011 is as fo llows: After the ADC binds to 
GPNMB on tumor cells, the complex is internalized and MMAE is released via proteolytic 
cleavage of the valine -citrulline linker in a lysosomal compartment. Tumor cell death 
occurs as a result of microtubule in hibition by [CONTACT_293853].

Toxicity:  
 
Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR)  
for 
CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin, NSC 763737)  
 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of reported 
and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform presentation of events by 
[CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list,  a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited 
Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset 
of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited repo rting to NCI (except 
as noted below). Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for further 
clarification.  Frequency is provided based on 255 patients. Below is the CAEPR for CDX -011 
(glembatumumab vedotin).  
 
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to the 
AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents 
and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to determine if expedited 
reporting is required.

Obtaining the Agent  
Agent Ordering  
To comply with the timing requirement for study enrollment ( Section  3.1.5 ), 
participating institutions are advised to plan ahead to ensure adequate and timely 
delivery of the investigational agent. Participating institutions may have to use their 
express courier account for overnight shippi[INVESTIGATOR_293827].  
 
NCI supplied agent may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution. Pharmaceutical Management Bra nch (PMB) policy 
requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated. PMB 
does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB 
is obtained). The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP 
supplied investigational agents. The responsible investigator at each participating institution 
must be registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA form 1572 
(Statement of Investigator), Curriculum Vita e, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), 
and Financial Disclosure Form (FDF). If there are several participating investigators at one 
institution, CTEP supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the 
name [CONTACT_177736].  
 
Active CTEP -registered investigators and investigator -designated shippi[INVESTIGATOR_293828] (OAOP) application https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/OAOP/pages/login.jspx . 
Access to OAOP requires the establishment of a CTEP Identity and Access Management 
(IAM) account https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam/  and the maintenance of an “active” account 
status and a “current” password. For questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or 
accountability, call (240) 276 -6575 Monday through Friday between 8:30 am and 4:30  pm 
(ET) or email [EMAIL_087]  anytime.  
 
Agent Accountability  
Agent Inventory Records:  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a 
careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from DCTD using the 
NCI Drug Accountability Record Form (DARF). See the CTEP home page at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov  for the Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage and to obtain 
a copy of the DARF and Clinical Drug Request form.  
 
Agent Returns:  
Investigators/Designees must return unused DCTD supplied investigational agent to the 
NCI clinical repository as soon as possible when: the agent is no longer required because 
the study is completed or discontinued and the agent cannot be transferred to another DCTD 
sponsored protocol; the agent is outdated or the agent is damaged or unfit for use. 
Regulations require that all agents received from the DCTD, NCI be returned to the DCTD, 
NCI f or accountability and disposition. Return only unused vials/bottles. Do NOT return 
opened or partially used vials/bottles unless specifically requested otherwise in the protocol.

9.[ADDRESS_357958] patient s without prior treatment with e ribulin . Eribulin has not been used as 
a component of therapy for newly diagnosed patients in pediatric protocols and there has 
been only one COG study of that agent for patients with recurrent disease. As such, we 
expected no more than 15% of patients who are eligible f or this study to have received 
eribulin as part of therapy prior to potential enrollment on this study.  Providing for possible 
ineligible and inevaluable patients, t he maximum enrollment will be [ADDRESS_357959]  38 patients in 24 months is 
80% and the corresponding probability for 3 0 months is in excess of 99 %. The study will 
likely require 2 to 2.5 years to enroll suff icient patients. A maximum of 38  patients is 
anticipated.  
 
9.2 Study Design  
Feasibility Cohort: The first six (6) younger patients (< 18 years of age) who are evaluable 
for toxicity will be considered as the feasibility cohort . All such patients will be assigned 
to receive 1.9 mg/kg/dose. Enrollment to this cohort will not be segr egated by [CONTACT_293855] e ribulin. Study accrual will be suspended after the sixth patient is enroll ed; 
enrollment of patients 18 years of age or older will continue regardless of the result in the 
feasibility cohort . If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of therapy occurs 
in one or fewer  evaluable patients then the trial accrual w ill proceed as outlined below.  
Patients who are enrolled in the toxicity cohort who receive the “feasible ” dose of CDX -
[ADDRESS_357960] 
response evaluable patients will be enrolled. Each patient will be evaluated for both 
outcome measures: (1) d isease control success; and (2)  RECIST response (C R or PR v. not 
CR or PR).  The decision rule for the two stage study design is summarized as:

Design Characteristics:  Each patient enrolled will be evaluated for: (1) complete or partial 
response as defined by [CONTACT_293856] (denoted as R below); or (2) stable 
disease after four months of therapy or at the end of the sixth cycle, whichever occurs first 
(denoted as S below) . We will not be interested in promoting the agent for further 
investigation if the probability of response in any particular individua l is less t han or equal 
to 0.05  (P(R)≤0.05) and the probability of remaining analytic event free in any particular 
individual is less than or equal to 0.20 (P(S)≤0.20). We will be interested in promoting the 
agent for further investigation if the probability of respo nse in any particular individual is 
at least 0.22 (P(R)≥0.22) or the probability of remaining analytic event free in any 
particular individual is at least 0.42 (P(S)≥0.42).

Prior Treatment with Eribulin: As noted in Section 9.[ADDRESS_357962] no more than 15% of 
patien ts will have been treated with e ribulin prior to enrollment on AOST1521. Patients 
will be evaluated for S and R as described above. Enrollment to this stratum will be 
terminated when we can determine there are sufficient patients to fully evaluate the efficacy 
of CDX -011 in the str atum of patients without prior e ribulin therapy. If 19  patients with 
prior e ribulin therapy are enrolled, the staged design described  above for patients without 
prior e ribulin therapy will be applied to this stratum.  
 
9.3 Methods of Analysis  for Pharmacokinetics  (Aim 1.2.2)  
Data from all patients who provide samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be aggregated. 
The sample mean and va riance of the AUC, clearance and half -life will be calculated. No 
formal statistical testing will be done.  
 
Pharmacokinetic studies are mandatory  for the first [ADDRESS_357963] Response : 
Any eligible patient who receives at least one dose of CDX -011 will be considered 
evaluable for response with the following exception: if a patient receives non -protocol anti -
cancer therapy during the response evaluation period after the patient is considered as 
having a partial or complete response but prior to conf irmation of this status by [CONTACT_293857], the individual will be considered 
inevaluable for the response endpoint. Further, patients who stop CDX -[ADDRESS_357964] 
evaluation because of toxicities or death will be considered evaluable for the response 
evaluation and will be counted as non -responders for the response endpoint.  
 
Which Patients Will Be Considered Evaluable for Disease Control Success : 
Any eligible pati ent who receives at least one dose of CDX -011 will be co nsidered 
evaluable for response w ith the following exception: if a patient receives non -protocol anti -
cancer therapy during the first four months of therapy or first six cycles of therapy, 
whichever o ccurs first, is considered as having a partial or complete response but prior to 
confirmation of this status by [CONTACT_293858], the 
individual will be considered inevaluable for the disease control success endpoint.  
 
Which Patients Will be Considered  a Disease Control Success : 
Any patient who is evaluated free of all de tectable disease (complete response) or is 
considered as having a partial response or is considered as having stable disease (‘at least 
stable disease’)  after four months of therapy or at the end of the sixth cycle, whichever 
occurs first.  
 
Which Patients Will be Considered Not a Disease Control Success : 
Any evaluable patient who does not meet the criteria for disease control success  (complete 
response, p artial response or stable disease) will be considered to not have exper ienced 
disease control success.  
In particular, any patient who dies because of treatment -related toxicity during the first six 
cycles of therapy and within the first four months since s tarting treatment will be

43 
Version date:  09/06 /[ADDRESS_357965] to follow -up at (for example) the end of 
cycle 2 will be considere d not a disease control succ ess (complete response, partial 
response or stable disease) .  
 
Patients who are not evaluable for both disease control and response evaluation may be 
replaced for the purposes of the statistical rule.  
 
9.5 Evaluability for Toxicity  
Tolerability of CDX -011 - An eligible patient will be considered for toxicity monitoring if 
one of the following occurs: (1) complete one cycle of CDX -011 prior to receiving non -
protocol anticancer therapy; (2) die on protocol therapy for a reason considered possibly, 
probably o r likely related to CDX -011; or (3) are removed from protocol therapy because 
of an adverse experience possibly, probably or likely related to CDX -011. A toxicity -
evaluable patient will be considered in the analysis during the interval from study 
enrollmen t until the termination of protocol therapy. A toxicity -evaluable patient will be 
considered to have experienced an excessive toxicity event if: (1) the patient dies on 
protocol therapy for a reason considered possibly, probab ly or likely related to; or 
(2) experiences a dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT) . DLTs will be  as defined in Section 5.1 .1 of 
the protocol :  
 
The analytic unit for monitoring for excessive toxicity will be the patient -cycle: Each cycle 
where the patien t receives CDX -011 and does not receive non -protocol anticancer therapy 
will be considered in the analysis. If there is overwhelming evidence that the dose selected 
for this trial has a per -cycle -DLT probability of more than 30%, we will identify the 
regim en to the COG DSMC, Bone Tumor Committee leadership and CTEP as associated 
with a toxicity profile that may require modification of the regimen. We will use a Bayesian 
rule to monitor for excessive toxicity. We will assume a beta prior to distribution with  
α=0.6 and β=1.4. If this posterior probability of the chance of DLT is at least 30%  exceeds 
80%, we will identify the regimen to the COG DSMC, Bone Tumor leadership and CTEP 
as associated with a toxicity profile that may require modification of the regime n.

9.7 Statistical Considerations for Secondary  Aim 1.2.3  
 
9.7.1 To determine the relationship of GPNMB expression by  [CONTACT_293859]:  Submission of archival tissue will be required for this 
study. The primary cohort to address this aim will be the patients who we re not 
previously treated with e ribulin. The GPNMB expression IHC result will be coded 
as an integer between 0 and 3 with 0 being no GPNMB expression and 3  indicating 
strong G PNMB  expression. The outcome measure will be DC success (Y es v. No). 
Logistic regression using the categorical IHC result will be fitted to the  data. The 
fitted coefficients from the logistic regression, and the p -value for the test of the 
hypothesis of no rela tionship between IHC result and probability of DC success 
will be used to characterize this secondary  analysis. Trend will also be assesse d 
using the actual IHC numerical value.

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for 
toxicity and performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
45 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms.  
 
Please note:  ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the mo st current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website (ie, v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to 
version 5.0).  
 
10.[ADDRESS_357967] response 
(CR or PR) at Cycle [ADDRESS_357968] confirmatory imaging after Cycle 8.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new intern ational 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) .[ADDRESS_357969] diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
10.2.1  Disease Parameters  
10.2. 1.1 Measurable disease : Measurable lesions  are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥  [ADDRESS_357970] x -ray, as ≥  [ADDRESS_357971] scan, or 
≥ [ADDRESS_357972] 
be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
10.2. 1.2 Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥  [ADDRESS_357973] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 
5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
 
10.2. 1.3  Non-measurable disease : All other lesions (or sites of disease), includin g 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with ≥  10 to <  15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither 
measur able nor non -measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple 
cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability 
described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same 
patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
10.2. 1.4  Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
46 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themse lves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected. A sum  of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included 
in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the s um. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
10.2. 1.5 Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesio ns over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be  
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
10.2. 2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4  weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
10.2. 2.1  Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superf icial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and  10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
10.2. 2.[ADDRESS_357974] x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
10.2. 2.[ADDRESS_357975] and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 
[ADDRESS_357976] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body 
scans).  
 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
47 
Version date:  09/06 /[ADDRESS_357977], spatial, 
and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition 
variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measur ement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is 
variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for 
the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with C T, 
the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse 
sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe 
specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all  scanners, body parts, and 
diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans. Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if possi ble. 
 
10.2. 2.4  Ultrasound : Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and 
should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound 
examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent 
review at a later date and, because they are  operator dependent, it cannot 
be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken 
from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by 
[CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_62553]. If there is c oncern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be 
used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
10.2. 2.5 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for 
objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques 
may be useful to confi rm complete pathological response when biopsies 
are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
10.2. 2.6 Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of  any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate 
between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progre ssive disease.  
 
10.2. 3 Response Criteria  
 
10.2. 3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
48 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
reduction in short axis to <10  mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the  smallest sum on 
study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5  mm. (Note: the appearance of 
one or more new lesions  is also considered 
progression ). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
10.2. 3.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10  mm 
short axis).  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status . It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions 
only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and 
the progr ession status should be confirmed at a later 
time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 
10.2. 3.[ADDRESS_357978] response recorded from the start of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of

10.2. 4 Duration of Response  
 
10.2. 4.1  Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first  date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement 
criteria a re first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is 
objectively documented.

Version date:  09/06 /16 
 
10.2. 4.2  Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of 
the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference 
the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, 
including the baseline measurements.  
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using simi lar agents. Certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
11.2 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious A dverse Events (SAEs)  
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI 
requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframes in the AE reporting table 
assigned to the protocol, using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting Sy stem (CTEP -AERS).  
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adver se drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  (for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718].  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may requir e medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_357979] 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP -AERS reporting table in this protocol.  
 
11.3.2 Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP -AERS if it 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
51 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
occurs  at any time following treatment with an agent under a NCI IND/IDE since 
these are considered serious AEs.  
 
11.3.3 Death  
Reportable Categories of Death  
 
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_293860] 
28 days of life.  
o Sudden Death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessatio n of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) - Other 
(Progressive Disease)” under the sys tem organ class (SOC) of the same 
name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease 
(e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical 
deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_357980] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within [ADDRESS_357981] dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention.  
 
11.3.4 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (eg, treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
The NCI requi res all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with 
an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
•Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
•Myelodysplastic syndrome  
•Treatment related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol.  
 
 
11.3.5  Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelat ed to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis  from the initial malignan cy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via C DUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
11.3.6 Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal  
NOTE : When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, 
or “Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form, available at:  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
52 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
http://ctep.ca ncer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/Pregna
ncyReportForm.pdf , needs to be completed and faxed along with any additional 
medical information to [PHONE_100].  The potential risk of exposure of the fetus 
to the investigational agent(s) or  chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in 
the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS report.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents that may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy needs 
to be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS as  
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal condition s - Other 
(pregnancy )” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  
 
Pregnancy needs to be followed until the outcome is known . If the baby 
[CONTACT_170727] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report 
is required.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fetal  Death  
Fetal death, defined in CTCAE as “ A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_293861]; failure of the product of conception to show evidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary muscle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possib ility of resuscitation ”, needs to 
be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions - Other (pregnancy loss) ”. Do NOT report a fetal 
death as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_52372] 28 days of life ” needs to be 
reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 “General disorders and 
administration - Other (ne onatal loss) ” when the death is the result of 
a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners of men on study . Do 
NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a patient pregnancy or 
pregnancy in partners of men on study as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -
AERS recogn izes any Grade 5 event as a patient death.  
 
11.4 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
11.4.1 Baseline AEs  
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” us ing CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre -existing condition (eg, elevated laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines.  
a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to determine if an expedited report is required.  
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re -assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required.  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
53 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at baseline.  
 
11.4.2 Persistent AEs  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution betw een 
treatment cycles/courses.  
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in a subsequent course. If the grade becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade.  
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course.  
 
11.4.3 Recurrent AEs  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course.  
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course must be reported by [CONTACT_293862].  
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unles s: 
1) The grade increases OR  
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
11.5 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
11.5.1 Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER)  
SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Events and 
Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected 
for CTEP -AERS reporting purposes. (Formerly referred to as the Agent Specific 
Adverse Event List (ASAE L).)  
 
AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by [CONTACT_293863] -AERS ONLY  if they exceed the grade of the event listed in 
parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a combination IND using 
multiple investigati onal agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  
 
11.5.[ADDRESS_357982] the 
primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation,  grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibility of the treating 
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
54 
Version date:  09/06 /16 
Note: All expedited A Es (reported via CTEP -AERS) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report

11.7 General Instructions for Expedited Reporting via CTEP -AERS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting and are located on 
the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CT CAE.  
 
An expedited AE report for all studies utilizing agents under an NCI IND/IDE must be 
submitted electronically to NCI via CTEP -AERS at: https://eapps -

within 7  calendar days of the investigator learning of the event.  
 
•Any event that results in a persistent or significant incapacity/substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is 
an IME, which based upon the medical judgment of the investigator may jeopa rdize 
the patient and require intervention to prevent a serious AE, must be reported via 
CTEP -AERS if the event occurs following investigational agent administration.  
 
•Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_357985] dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24 
hours .  
•Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_357986] dose with an attribution of 
possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an NCI IND/IDE requires  
expedited reporting within 24  hours .  
 
CTEP -AERS Medical Reporting includes the following requirements as part of the report: 
1) whether the patient has received at least one dose of an investigational agent on this 
study; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  (severit y), the

16.2.3 Bone Scan (Recommended)  
MDP bone scintigraphy  
• Whole body bone scintigraphy should be performed and include 
planar images of the skeleton, including anterior and posterior views 
of the axial skeleton. Anterior and/or posterior views should be 
obtained of the appendicular skeleton.  
• Delayed (skeletal phase) images should be performed in all cases with 
flow and blood pool images as per local custom and clinical need.  
• Dose Administration: Dose administered should be according to  
standard weight -based protocols. Injection site should be away from 
lesion extremity or contralateral extremity if flow imaging is to be 
performed. Three -phase imaging is not required unless warranted by 
[CONTACT_293867] a focal lesion to assess hyperemia.  
• Imaging Parameters: Whole body delayed imaging is acquired 2 -
3 hours after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Spot views should 
be acquired of specific sites of symptoms or of any sites of 
abnormality as warranted by [CONTACT_293868].  
• Single -photo n emission computed tomography (SPECT) is 
recommended, but not required, particularly in cases with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_293834].  
• SPECT Imaging: SPECT should be performed of the lesion site. 
SPECT imaging should be performed as recommended by [CONTACT_293869]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_293835] 360° 
circular orbit, 60 –120 stops, 64 ´ 64 ´ 16 or greater matrix, and 10 –
40 s/stop. An equivalent total number of counts should be acquired if 
continuous acquisition is used.  
• Special Consid eration: Imaging of pelvis can be difficult due to 
overlying bladder activity. To lessen this problem, repeat imaging can 
be performed immediately after patient voiding. Bladder 
catheterization may be used, but should be reserved for patients in 
whom visua lization of the pelvis is essential. For SPECT acquisition 
of the pelvis: Single or multiple rapid (5 -10 min/acquisition) SPECT 
acquisition(s) are preferred to avoid artifacts caused by [CONTACT_293870]. Bladder artifacts are exaggerated in  the plane 
in which the SPECT acquisition begins and ends. Beginning SPECT 
acquisition with the camera heads in the left and right lateral positions 
(for dual -head camera) or posterior position (for single -head camera) 
will help reduce bladder filling arti fact.  
 
16.2.4 [18F]–Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) Imaging 
(Recommended)  
FDG PET imaging is optional, but is encouraged for all patients. The primary 
lesion must be ≥ [ADDRESS_358005] cycle 
thereafter.  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESE ARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST1521  
66 
Version date:  09/06 /[ADDRESS_358006] 4 hours prior to injection of FDG. FDG PET 
imaging may follow a MUGA study on the same day, or FDG PET imaging may 
be performed on the day preceding this study. Plasma glucose should be checked 
and, if the patient is hyperglycemic (plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL), appropriate 
treatment with small doses of insulin may be given to bring the plasma glucose 
into the normal range prior to FDG PET imaging. However, insulin administration 
may result in excessive muscle uptake of FDG and consequent tumor non -
visualization. If possible,  the study should be postponed until the plasma glucose 
is under better control.  
 
Good hydration is required, as the primary route of FDG excretion is renal. The 
patient should drink water or receive intravenous fluids (not containing dextrose) 
after FDG i njection to promote urinary excretion of the radioactive substrate. After 
injection, the patient must be kept in a resting state for 45 -60 minutes prior to 
imaging. The patient should empty the bladder immediately prior to imaging.  
 
Imaging Technique  
The t echnique will vary by [CONTACT_293871]. In general, FDG is 
administered intravenously at a dose of 0.125 -0.200 mCi/kg or by [CONTACT_293872], with a minimum total dose of 2.0 mCi and  
maximum total dose of 2 0.0 mCi.  
 
The body should be imaged from the top of the ears to the bottom of the feet. If 
there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_293836], the volume that is 
imaged should be expanded.  
 
Imaging with a dedicated positron emission tomogra ph/computed tomography 
(PET/CT) camera is standard .   
 
The length of time needed to perform head to toe CT will depend on the patient’s 
height but will be approximately [ADDRESS_358007] to patient positioning,  the arms can 
be placed in a comfortable position at the patient’s sides as long as they fit into the 
field of view. If the patient is large it may be necessary to lay the arms across the 
abdomen and hold in position with a stabilizing device.  
 
Study Proce ssing  
The FDG PET study is processed for display by [CONTACT_293873]. FDG activity should be corrected for attenuation, scatter, and 
radioactive decay. Attenuation correction is necessary, as apparent uptake will 
otherwise vary with de pth of the lesion in the body and the nature of surrounding 
tissues. The procedure used for attenuation correction should be recorded. The 
level of tumor uptake is assessed subjectively by [CONTACT_293874] -
quantitatively by [CONTACT_293875] (SUV). Uptake time, 
glucose levels, and partial volume effects influence both methods. The SUV

Version date:  09/06 /16 
method is also dependent on body weight, and correction of SUV by [CONTACT_293876] (BSA) reduces this dependency on body w eight. SUVs 
should be calculated for lesions known to be 1.[ADDRESS_358008] underestimated SUVs due to partial volume averaging effects at 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_293837] (0.6 -1.2 cm).  
 
To calculate the SUV, a region of inte rest (ROI) should be carefully drawn around 
as much of the area of elevated FDG uptake as can be done. The SUV should be 
calculated as SUV BSA = ROI activity concentration (nCi/cc) x BSA / injected 
activity (nCi). SUV MAX is obtained by [CONTACT_293877][INVESTIGATOR_293838].  
 
The BSA is calculated from body mass (kg) and height (cm) using an appropriate 
algorithm. The SUV BSA for each measured lesion should be recorded and the 
technique for assessing SUV BSA should be consistent on follow -up studies.

APPENDIX II:  YOUTH INFORMATION SHEETS  
INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY AOST 1521  
(for subjects from 7  to 12 years of age)  
 
A trial using a new drug, CDX -011, to treat osteosarcoma that has not responded to treatment or that has 
come back  
 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your illness, osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of can cer 
that grows in the cells that produce bones. After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of 
cancer  and it has not gotten better with treatment or it has come back .  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have ost eosarcoma  and it has not gotten 
better with treatment or it has come back . A research study is when doctors work together to try out 
new ways to help people who are sick. In this study we are trying to learn more about how to treat 
osteosarcoma that has co me back. We will do this by [CONTACT_91959] a new drug to treat osteosarcoma. We do 
not know how well the new drug will work in children, teens and young adults. That is why we are 
doing this study.  
 
3. Children who are part of this study will be given a n experime ntal new drug  called CDX -011. You will 
also have scans  to see if the cancer is getting worse, staying the same or getting better. There is a 
possibility that you will also have surgery or radiation therapy (high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells ) 
while yo u are part of this study. Surgery and radiation therapy are often used to treat osteosarcoma 
and they are not experimental.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good things are 
called “benefits.” We hope t hat a benefit to you of being part of this study is that you are able to get 
rid of the cancer. But we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this study.  
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad things are 
called “risks.” Being in this study may involve special risks, which your doctor will discuss with you. 
Other things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about.  
 
6. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to stop being in 
this study at any time once you start.  There may be other treatments for your illness that your doctor 
can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.  
 
7. We are trying to learn about how children’s bodies handle the new drug CDX -011. If you are getting 
treatment at certain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] , we will take extra blood samples from you for research tests. These 
samples will be drawn through your central line if you have one.  
 
If you are getting t reatment at a different hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], w e are asking your permission to collect additional 
blood. We are trying to learn how child and teenage bodies handle the new drug. These additional 
blood tests may help children, teens and adults who take this drug in the  future. These blood tests will 
require additional blood draws, which will be drawn through your central line if you have one. You 
can still be treated on this study even if you don't allow us to collect the extra blood samples for 
research .

A trial using a new drug, CDX -011, to treat osteosarcoma that has not responded to treatment or that has 
come back  
 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your illness, os teosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer 
that grows in the cells that produce bones. Recurrent means that the cancer has come back after 
treatment. After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have recurrent osteosarcoma. A 
research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this 
study we are trying to learn more about how to treat osteosarcoma that has come back. We wi ll do this 
by [CONTACT_91959] a new drug to treat recurrent osteosarcoma. We do not know how well the new drug will

APPENDIX IV:  PATIENT DRUG INFORMATION HANDOUT AND WALLET CARD  
 
Information for Patients, Their Caregivers and Non -Study Healthcare Team on Possible Interactions 
with Other Drugs and Herbal Supplements  
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the experimental study 
drug, CDX -011. This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_293879]. This form is addressed to 
the patient, but includes important information for others who care for this patient.  
 
These are the things that you as a healthcare provider need to know:  
  
CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) interacts with certain specific enzymes in your liver* and certain 
transport proteins that help move drugs in and out of cells**.  
 
• *The  enzyme in question is CYP3A4. CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) is metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 . Patients must be closely monitored for adverse reaction if strong inhibitors or inducers 
are administered with CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin).  
• **The protein in ques tion is P -glycoprotein (P -gp). CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) requires P -
gp to move in  and o ut of cells. Patients receiving P -gp inhibitors concomitantly with CDX -011 
(glembatumumab vedotin) should be closely monitored for adverse reactions.  
 
To the patient: Take this paper with you to your medical appointments and keep the attached 
information c ard in your wallet .   
 
CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) may interact with other drugs which can cause side effects. For this 
reason, it is very important to tell your study doctors of any medicines you are taking before you enroll onto 
this clinical trial. It is also very important to tell your doctors if you stop taking any regular medicines, or 
if you start taking a new medicine whi le you take part in this study.  When you talk about your current 
medications with your doctors, include medicine you buy witho ut a prescription (over -the-counter remedy), 
or any herbal suppl ements such as St. John’s Wort.  It is helpful to bring your medication bottles or an 
updated medication list with you.  
 
Many health care prov iders can write prescriptions. You must tell all of  your health care providers (doctors, 
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists) you are taking part in a clinical trial.  
 
These are the things that you and they need to know:  
CDX -011 (glembatumumab vedotin) must be used very carefully with other medicines that use certain liver 
enzymes or transport proteins to be effective or t o be cleared from your system. Before you enroll onto the 
clinical trial, your study doctor will work with your  regular health care providers to review any me dicines 
and herbal supplements that are considered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 or transport 
protein P -gp”. 
 
• Please be very careful!  Over -the-counter drugs (including herbal supplements) may contain ingredients 
that could  interact with your s tudy drug.  Speak to your doctors or pharmacist to determine if there could 
be any side effects.  
• Your regular health care provider should check a frequently updated medical reference or call 
your study doctor before prescribing any new medicine  or disconti nuing any medicine.  Your 
study doctor’s name [CONTACT_832] __________________________________ and he or she can be

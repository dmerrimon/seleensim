9) Questions:   
a) When providing a interscalene nerve block (ISB) for painful shoulder surgery 
using the following four regimens: 
i)  0.75% plain ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. The reference comparator.  
ii) A mixture of 0.75% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 300 mcg buprenorphine 
iii) A mixture of 0.75% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 0.1 mcg /kg clonidine  
iv) A mixture of 0.75% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_755197] 8mg dexamethasone  
b) Compared to 0.75% plain ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], will the adjuvant mixture: 
i)  Increase block analgesic duration ? 
(Defined as elapsed times from block -needle withdrawal until patient -reported time that they were 
first aware of painful sensation in the operated region of the limb.)  
  
10) Hypothesis:

Local Anesthetic  Adjuvants in Interscalene Nerve Block  
Page 2 of 13 a) Null Hypothesis:  Compared to plain ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], the adjuvant mixture:  
i) Will not increase the nerve block analgesic duration time by 25% or more. 
b) Alternate Hypothesis:  Compared to plain ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], the adjuvant mixture: 
i) Will increase the nerve block analgesic duration time by 25% or more. 
11) Primary Outcome:   
a) Our primary outcome is the time from nerve block-needle withdrawal to return of:  
 
i) Painful perception in the operated upon area of the limb. 
 
b) Block Quality: Achieving an inability to sense cold ice -water in the cutaneous 
distribution  of the brachial plexus trunk distal to the block within 30 minutes will 
be considered a successful nerve block preoperatively .  If the patient has an 
inability to sense cold ice -water in the  cutaneous distribution of the brachial 
plexus trunk distal to the block within 30 minutes will be considered a successful 
nerve block postoperatively. Anything less will be considered a failed nerve 
block. 
 
12) Secondary Outcomes:    
i) Return of sensory function in the blocked area of the limb. 
ii) Return of motor function in the blocked area of the limb. 
iii) Post-op Nausea and vomiting before discharge 
iv) Nausea and Vomiting after discharge 
v) Changes in Blood Pressure (BP) in the PACU defined as any blood 
pressure +/ - 20% of patient’s baseline (either BP on admission if no clinic 
BP is documented, or most recent clinic BP as documented if that exists)  
vi) Changes in Blood Pressure in Second Stage defined as any blood pressure +/- 20% of patient’s baseline (either BP on admission if no clinic BP is 
documented, or most recent clinic BP as documented if that exists)

2) Study Background Information:   
Regional anesthesia in the ambulatory surgery center venue has been shown to decrease 
unwanted side effects of anesthesia and improve patient satisfaction with their operative care.  Clinicians often seek ways to increase the duration of peripheral nerve blocks( 1, 2) 
for outpatient surgery.  This may  enhance patient satisfaction  and make for fewer  
unwanted post-operative side effects  from anesthesia such as nausea and vomiting.  One 
way to prolong regional anesthesia for patients is to send them home with a peripheral nerve catheter. (3-6) However, there can be multiple interventions  associated with these.  
Catheter adverse conditions  include infection, local anesthetic toxicity, catheter failure or 
dislodgement, infusion leakage, difficulty for the patient to remove their own catheter , 
and inadequate access to medical  resources (7-9). 
 Adding adjuvants to local anesthetics has been a principle for some time.  Anesthesiologists have been adding epi[INVESTIGATOR_755198].  Candido and Franco both added buprenorphine to upper extremity blocks and received triple  the pain relief duration from their nerve blocks(10, 11).  In 
addition Candido also added buprenorphine to a sciatic nerve block and received and 
additional 6 hours of pain relief( 12).  Cummings (13)of the Cleveland Clinic studied 
dexamethasone added to interscalene blocks and showed it added twice as much 
analgesic duration t o the nerve block( 14-16).  Kim and Movafegh also studied adding 
decadron to local anesthetics and showed prolongation of sensory and motor block (16-17).  Casati’s research showed that addin g Clonidine to Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_755199] 3 hours( 17-19).  Although neither three 
adjuvant is FDA approved for perineural applications, they have been used in many studies without any detriment to patients (20).  [CONTACT_755226], of the University of

Page 5 of 13 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_755200] a laboratory level and has not shown 
any neural toxicity with these adjuvant additions( 21, 22).  Steroids have also been used in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_755201].  Dexamethasone has even been used (23).  
Clonidine has been studied for epi[INVESTIGATOR_755202]( 24-26).  It is FDA 
approved for used in epi[INVESTIGATOR_755203].  Currently, we are using clonidine at the University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755204].  We have it in our epi[INVESTIGATOR_755205].  Buprenorphine has also been studied for use intrathecally without problems( 27).  There is a study by [CONTACT_755222]( 28).   
Study Methods:   
This study will be performed in the Ambulatory Surgery Center at the University of Iowa.  All included patients will be undergoing orthopedic surgery on their shoulder for a surgery on the shoulder girdle, excluding the scapula .  All regional blocks will be 
performed or directly observed and guided by [CONTACT_755223] s.  Blocks will be 
done using the interscalene approach to the brachial plexus.  All the injections will be placed using simultaneous ultrasound guidance and a nerve stimulator technique with a previously published compressed air injection technique to limit injection pressure.( 29, 
30)   
Per previous protocols involving anesthesia studies at University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (UIHC),  those patients who are eligible will be  given information on the day of 
surgery.  A nurse not involved with the study will give the patient a card briefly 
informing the patient that they are eligible for a nerve block study.  If the patient indicates thei r consent to hear more and possibly enroll in the study, a representative 
from the investigating team will then meet with the patient to explain the study and 
obtain informed consent.   
 An offer of regional anesthesia with or without intravenous sedation or general anesthesia will be provided to all patients regardless of their decision to participate or not.  The techniques, practices, medications and use of ice-water to test blocks described in this protocol are currently used in common practice.   
3) Inclusion Criteria:

Page 7 of 13 3) Consent:   
a) The study will be explained to the patient’s satisfaction, their questions will be 
answered, and informed consent will be obtained from the patient after explanation of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. 
b)  Once the patient has consented to the study, they will be included in the study and followed throughout. 
c) Patients with failed blocks will be included in the intention to treat analysis. 
d) If the block is unable to be placed due to infection at the site, poor visualization of structures with the ultrasound, inability to obtain study drugs within a reasonable time frame,  or unexpected operator difficulty in placing the block, the patient will 
not be included in the intention to treat analysis and dropped from the study. 
 
4) Randomization:   
a) A computerized random number generator will be used by a staff  of the 
Anesthesia Department not involved with the study. They will create a 
randomized numbered sequence with four groups (A, B, C or D) that will be 
given to the pharmacy team. This will be used to fill study syringes in the sequence according to the randomization schema.  
b) The UIHC  Pharmacy will compound the study drugs and will fill and label the 
coded study syringes.  
c) Coded study syringes must be created and delivered within 30 minutes of the physician’s request.  
d) The Pharmacy will keep a record of which patient received each coded syringe and the solution they contained. 
e) They will be given to the practitioner at the time of block placement.   
f) Practitioners w ill perform the block using the pharmacy coded study drug.  
 
5) Masking: 
a) Masking will be accomplished by [CONTACT_755224]. 
b) At the end of the study enrollment , information given to the statistical analyst will 
be blindly coded as groups A, B, C or D for data analysis.   
c) The Pharmacy will keep the group codes until after data analysis is complete.  
d) The anesthesiologist and nurse assistants will be masked to the study mixtures.  
e) Any assisting anesthesia Staff, Fellows, Residents, CRNAs, SRNAs, or medical 
students will be masked to the study mixtures.  
f) Patients will be masked to the study mixtures.  
g) Any person collecting and/or scribing the data will be masked to the study mixtures. 
h) Any person analyzing the data will be masked to the study mixtures.  
i) Once all the data has been collected and analyzed according to gr oup code, the 
blinding on the study mixtures can be broken and the codes for the study mixtures made known. 
j) Safety monitors will not be masked to the mixtures.  They can communicate with 
the pharmacy to unmask the mixtures for only themselves.  They will not report the mixtures or pharmacy codes to anyone except for patient safety purposes.

Page 8 of 13 k) The coded sample syringes will be kept for reanalysis in case there is any question 
of what mixture was given to any patient.  The syringe contents can be tested by [CONTACT_81003] a group code for that patient or set of patients will then be given 
to the analyst.  The masking will remain intact.  
 
6)  Study Mixtures  
a) The local anesthetic study mixtures  volumes will be the same (32 mL) and 
contained in  two thirty-milliliter sy ringes with [ADDRESS_1033813] of:  
i) 0.75% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] x 30mL (225 mg max dose) + 2 mL saline for a total 
volume of 32 mL  
ii) 0.75% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] x 30mL (225 mg max dose) with 300 mcg buprenorphine (1 mL) + 1 mL sterile saline for a total volume of 32 mL  
iii) 0.75% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] x 30mL (225 mg max dose) with 100 mcg /kg 
clonidine (0.1 mL) + 1.9 mL sterile saline for a total volume of 32 mL  
iv) 0.75% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] x 30mL (225 mg max dose) with 8mg dexamethasone (2 mL) + 0 mL sterile saline for a total volume of 32 mL.  
v) Note: If drug shortages occur during the study and we are unable to use 
the same concentration of any additive drugs (e.g. dexamethasone 10mg/mL instead of 4mg/mL), then a substitution will be allowed and the total volume in the syringe will be changed so that all syringes will be the same volume and final ropi[INVESTIGATOR_755206].   
 
7) Techniques:   
All the blocks will be performed:  
a) Either by, or under the direct supervision and direction of the Primary Investigator or regional anesthesia faculty listed on the investigation team. 
b) In the Ambulatory Surgery Center at the University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755207].  
c) A timeout will be performed before the block to verify the patient, site of surgery and that we are blocking the correct side (already marked).  
d) Using sterile technique, cleaning the skin with tinted chlorhexidine and with the 
operators wearing caps, masks, and sterile gloves.  The ultrasound probe will have a sterile sheath over it. Steri le ultrasound gel will be used. 
e) With ultrasound guidance and  nerve stimulator from 0.2 mA to 2.0 mA using a 
sterile Arrow 90mm insulated stimulation needle (StimuQuick).  
f) If we are unable to stimulate the brachial plexus at the trunk level with the nerve 
stimulator, we will place local anesthetic in the region where the brachial plexus nerves are visualized using ultrasound based on the practitioner’s experience with ultrasound- guided interscalene (brachial plexus trunks) nerve blocks.  
g) Block start and end times will be recorded. Start time begins at block n eedle 
insertion. Stop time is the  time of nerve block-needle withdrawal. 
h) All patients will be monitored with blood pressure, pulse oximetry, ECG and have 2 liters per minute of oxygen adm inistered by [CONTACT_21294].  
i) Emergency resuscitation equipment , intralipid,  and emergency  medications are 
present and immediately available for patient safety .  
A Prospective Triple -Masked Randomized Controlled Trial of Analgesia Duration  of  
Local Anesthetic  Adjuvants in Interscalene Nerve Block  
Page 9 of 13 j) Anesthesiologists will be present and/or immediately available should 
resuscitation efforts be n ecessary in the unlikely event of drug toxicity, cardiac 
arrest, or other adverse event. 
k) Any adverse outcomes (listed in “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” #23 below) will be reported to 
the Safety Monitors on the day it happens. 
l) The use of rescue blocks in the PACU will be  counted and analyzed. 
 
8) Statistics  
a) For our primary outcome, we will use ANOVA or Kruskall -Wallis test, after 
checking the normality of the data, to compare the duration of the analgesic block.  
If we find a difference among all [ADDRESS_1033814] to explore differences  between the individual groups.  
b) For our continuously distributed secondary outcomes , given that outcome s will 
be observed on every patient , we will use ANOVA or Kruskall -Wallis test. For 
outcomes with categories (nausea and vomiting and blood pressure ), we will use 
the chi-square test.  Similarly, we will explore the different group or groups using 
chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact test.  
c) We based our estimates upon Cumming’s, Candido’s and Casati’s previous studies and our cl inical experience.  We have estimated  the expected additional 
analgesic time between the three groups.  
d) Using the above parameters, a sample size is 40  per group with 4 total groups  
calculates to  a sum of 160 subjects while using 90% power and 0.05 type I error 
rate.  
 
9) Safety Monitoring:  
a) An Anesthesiology Faculty member who is not involved in the study will act as 
safety monitor and will review the data and any complications when half of the patients (n = 80) have been compl eted.  
 10) Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:   
a) Any incidence of patient complications that occur with an incidence higher than published data for the following complications for peripheral nerve blocks will be enough cause for the Safety Monitors to stop the study( 31, 32). Numbers in 
parentheses below are the highest incidence reported in the referenced article for peripheral nerve block complications.  The highes t incidence of complications 
was reported to be from the supraclavicular block, which we will not be performing.  We are relying on results reported from our own regional anesthesia follow-up clinic.  This is a clinic developed here to see patients with tr oublesome 
complications of peripheral nerve blocks.  The complication rates have been reviewed and studied since the clinic inception over 4 years ago (33). We are 
erring on the side of caution by [CONTACT_755225] . 
 b)  Published Peripheral Nerve Block Complication rates: i) Seizure (26.3/10,000)  
ii) Cardiac arrest (Code Blue)  (15.9/10,000)

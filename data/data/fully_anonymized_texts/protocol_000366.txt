6.RATIONALE A ND BACKGROUND
Migraine is a common, often disabling neurologic disease characterized by  [CONTACT_614983] t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_614975], throbbing, and associated with a range of s ymptoms 
that may  include photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting.1-3Migraine can be 
classified as epi[INVESTIGATOR_614976] m igraine or headache: 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (EM) is characterized b y one to 1
4monthly  headache day s (MHDs) or 
monthly  migraine day s (MMDs), while chronic migraine (CM) is characterized by  [ADDRESS_815710] clinical burden, pat ients experience a 
greater number of comorbidities compared to those without migraine.5
While treatment goals vary  by [CONTACT_11338], guidelines from both the US and [LOCATION_009] (the most 
recentl y published treatment goals in Eur ope) for acute migraine treatment suggest these are 
rapid and sustained freedom from pain, improvement in other migraine s ymptoms, and 
minimal or no adverse events (AEs).6,7There is significant need for effective and tolerable 
treatments for migraine sufferers, especiall y those who experience at least four migraine days 
per month. In these patients, preventive treatment is recommended to reduce migraine -
related 
disabi lity and the overuse of acute therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614977].6Both US and European 
guidelines note the importance of reduced attack frequency , reduction or maintenance (no 
escalation) of acute treatment use, and an improvement in quality  of life (QoL).6,7Current 
migraine treatments leave millions of people who have migraine with unmet needs due to 
lack of and/or insuffici ent efficacy , AEs, and contraindications.8,9
Treatment strategies aim to abort epi[INVESTIGATOR_614978], 
with "triptans" (5 -hydroxy tryptamine [5 -HT]1b/1d receptor agonists) being the most 
commonly  used presc ription medications for acute treatment
.10However, their effectiveness 
is not universal, and due to vasoconstrictive effects, they  are contr aindica ted in patients with 
known cardiovascular disease (CV) . Recent advancements have introduced 2novel classes of 
acute migraine medications: selective 5- HT1F agonists ("ditans") and CGRP antagonists 
("gepants"), with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving Lasmiditan, Ubrogepant, 
and rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine in adults.
Rimegepant (VYDURA®/NURTEC® ODT), a next -generation, small molecule oral 
selective and potent calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, is the first 
and only  migraine treatment approved for both the acute treatment of migraine with or 
without aura in adults and for the preventive treatment of EM in adults who have at least four

V1.[ADDRESS_815711] comparisons between the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of rimegepant and 
triptans are confounded by [CONTACT_614984] .
This study  will utilize retrospective data collected with the Migraine Budd yMobile 
application to evaluate satisfaction of treatment with rimegepant and triptans .The primary  
motivation for the study  isto generate evidence to support a submission to the Natio nal 
Reimbursement Drugs List (NRDL) in China, but it is anticipated that results will also be of 
relevance to health care providers and pay ers outside of China.

8. RESEARCH METHODS 
8.1.Study Design 
This is a retrospective analy sis of cross -sectional data co llected in the Migraine Buddy  app 
between [ADDRESS_815712] ugsbeing used. 
Data from users reporting use of Nurtec and/ or a triptan (and Rizatriptan in particular) will be 
extracted for anal ysis.
The primary  endpoint is the level of satisfaction on several dimensions of migraine 
characteristics. Survey  questions a sk specificall y about satisfaction with Nurtec or the triptan. 
The level of satisfaction with Nurtec will be compared to the level of satisfaction with 
triptans.
The strength of this design is the real-life setting of the data collected. Users were using the 
Migraine Budd y app for tracking their migraines in real life .
8.2.
Setting
Migraine Budd y is an app available on iOS and Android. I t’s used by  [CONTACT_614985]. I t generates reports that users are able to share
with their doctors to help them establish a diagnosis and/or optimize treatment. The app has 
been downloaded more than 3.[ADDRESS_815713] one migraine attack treated with that specific acute treatment (via a survey  about this 
medication in particular eg ,“Are you satisfied with Nurtec?”) .Once completed, the survey  is 
removed from the home page unless the user switches or initiates a new acute migraine 
treatment. If a patient is using more than one acute treatment, they  will be able to complete 
satisfaction questions for each acute treatm ent. Approximately  two -thirds of the app users are 
currentl y using both rimegepant and triptans to acutely  treat their migraine attacks. Q uestions 
are worded such that they ask specifically  about the particular acute treatment eg ,Nurtec . For 
the survey s u
sed in the 7-month time frame of this retrospective stud y, feasibility  assessment 
showed that participants answered the satisfaction questions for a specific acute medication

Data was gathered between 30 October 2023 & 20 May 2024 from users of the Migraine 
Budd y app through the “diary tracking” and the satisfaction questions
were administered via 
survey and via the interac tive data collection tool named “Tay lor”.  All the data will be 
extracted from the Aptar Digital Health ( ADH )
platform existing database in order to 
perform the anal ysis described in this protocol .
8.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
Patients who us edNurtec and/ or triptans as an acute treatment for migraine, with or without a 
background of preventive treatment (anti -CGRP, Botox or oral migraine preventive 
medications).
Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for th estudy :
1.Male or female participants with migraine
2.Having consented to the anony mous use of their data for research

8.2.2. Exclusion Criteria
Patients meeting an y of the following criteria will not be included i n the study :
1. Users who did not report using either medication for which they  complete the survey  
within 60 day s prior to the survey .
8.3.
Variables
For this retrospective study , the onl y variable scollected arethe self -reported satisfaction of 
Migraine Budd y users via a questionnaire accessible from the home screen of the app.
Satisfaction with Nurtec or triptans was asked in relation to several dimensions: pain
intensity , 
attack duration, speed of action, cognitive impact of Migraine, tolerabilit y, and 
other s ymptoms.

This questionnaire asked the level of satisfaction with their treatme nt on a 7 -levels Lickert 
scale. (1  = extremely  dissatisfied to 7 = extremely  satisfied). Based on their responses, the 
respondents will be stratified into those who were dissatisfied (reporting 1  = extremely  
dissatisfied to 3  = somewhat dissatisfied), neut ral (4=neither d issatisfied nor satisfied) or 
satisfied (reporting 5  = somewhat satisfied to 7 = extremely  satisfied) with the treatment. 
Data will be reported for the overall cohort, no individual data will be shared.

Page 13of 208.7.Data Analysis 
The study  analysis population will include patients who received Nurtec and/or triptans as an 
acute treatment cu rrentl y for their migraine. 
The feasibility  of subg roup anal yses will be explored (eg ,by [CONTACT_614987] , currentl y 
using proph ylactic treatment). Feasibility  will evaluate if there is sufficient sample size for 
meaningful comparisons. All outcomes wil l remain blinded for the feasibility  assessment.
The mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25thand 75thpercentiles and minimum and 
maximum values will be reported for numeric variables, whilst relative frequencies and 
percentages will be reported for c ategorical variables.
To compare the outcome measure s (Section 7)between adults diagnosed with migraine who 
are using either Nurtec or triptans as an acute treatment for migraine, a ppropriate tests 
(eg, t -test, chi -
square test) will be used base d on the distribution of the measure. The alpha 
level will be 0.05, [ADDRESS_815717] the non-missing observations (the ‘ base’)of 
patients to vary  from variable to variable. The base relevant to each anal ysis will be reported 
in any  data tables provided. This study  will use a ‘ complete case analy sis’ approach to handle 
missing valu es, ie,there will be no imputation of missing data. Where missing values are 
found in a particular variable, any patients with missing values will be removed from all 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_614979]. However, patients removed from one pi[INVESTIGATOR_614980].11
8.8.Quality Control
As this is a retrospective study , issues of qualit y control at study sites, eg, data queries , do 
not apply .Analy sis is programm ed according to the specifications in this protocol.
Data will be cleaned to address missing values, outliers and inconsistencies.
No open field questions are used in the survey , participants simply  check boxes. 
Programming prevented users from selected multiple answers to single- choice questions. The 
number of variables is low. No specific encoding (C -DISC etc) is needed.
8.9. Limitations of the Research Methods
While Migraine Buddy  users self -report as having migraine ha sbeen shown to be reliable, it 
is pos
sible that they have been misdiagnosed or are currently  receiving a triptan to assist an 
HCP with determining a diagnosis of migraine.12This would potentially  reduce the response 
to migraine -specific drugs such as triptans or rimegepant.

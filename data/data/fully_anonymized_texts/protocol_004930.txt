Prostate Embolization for Benign Prostatic 
Hyperplasia   
This is a Phase I/II study with  the primary goal of 
determining the safety of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) 
for benign prostatic hypertrophy. Our primary outcome is the 
frequency of adverse events, particularly bladder and rectal 
complications, which may occur as a result of this procedure. 
Secondarily, the study will allow us to begin to determine its 
effectiveness in diminishing obstructive symptoms associated 
with BPH.

5. Study Description  (summarize the protocol according to the following format in less than 2 total pages)  
 
Study Design (for example, hypothesis, research question, standard and experimental procedures, special or 
unusual equipment or procedures) : 
 
This study will assess if embolization of the prostate can produce symptomatic improvement for patients with 
lower urinary tra ct symptoms as a result of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It will be managed by [CONTACT_578104][INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Rationale and justi fication for study (for example, historical background, investigator’s personal experience, 
pertinent medical literature):  
 
Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a highly prevalent condition in which there is nodular growth of prostatic tissue, 
enlarging the pro state and narrowing the urethra. It may result in symptoms of lower urinary tract obstruction 
including hesitancy, intermittent voiding, weakened urinary stream, incomplete emptying, and post -void 
leakage.  The pathophysiology of BPH -induced obstruction in cludes mechanical and dynamic components.  
The mechanical component consists of tissue invasion into the urethral lumen or bladder neck.  The dynamic 
component results from adrenergic tone on the smooth muscle within the stroma.  Both these components 
contribute to an increase in urinary outflow resistance.  
 
Current medical management of BPH includes two classes medications that target the dynamic and stable 
aspects of prostatic obstruction; α -adrenergic blockers and 5α -reductase inhibitors respectively. Th e α-
adrenergic blockers directly inhibit sympathetic tone, which relaxes the smooth muscle of the prostate.  The 5α -
reductase inhibitors (including Finasteride) prevent conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is 
the chief hormone promoting  stromal and epi[INVESTIGATOR_578094].  Over the course of a year, this 
can decrease peri -urethral prostate size and relieve obstruction.  
 
Anti-cholinergics are another class of medications used to ameliorate lower urinary obstructive sympt oms. The 
urinary bladder contracts when muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle are stimulated by [CONTACT_578105].  While 
these drugs do not benefit patients with symptoms secondary to BPH, some of these patients may in fact have 
co-incident bladder dysfunctio n and anticholinergic medications may prove beneficial [1]. 
Surgical therapy is reserved for patients exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms not controlled by [CONTACT_578106].  Traditionally open prostatectomy was the 
surgical option of choice, but with on set of new surgical techniques and technologies open prostatectomy is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_578095] (usually >80 -100g) prostates. Open prostatectomy may also be recommended when 
there is a concomitant bladder diverticulum or bladder stone.  
The current gold standard of surgical options is transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). This procedure 
focuses on resecting peri -urethral prostatic tissue, which is most contributory to static obstruction.  
Complications of TURP include significan t bleeding, TUR syndrome (hyponatremia secondary to absorption of 
Georgetown University Institutional Review Board  IRB Number: ________________  
Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  5 hypotonic irrigant), retrograde ejaculation, and urinary incontinence.  Given these potentially serious adverse 
events, several new techniques have been developed, yet a recent systematic re view noted that there is little 
evidence any are more efficacious than TURP and as such it remains the gold standard [2]. Some of these 
newer approaches include transurethral incision of prostate, which is reserved for men with obstruction and 
small prostates.  This procedure is more rapid than TURP and outcomes in well -selected patients are equivalent 
to that of TURP with less morbidity from bleeding, TUR syndrome, and rate of retrograde ejaculation [3]. 
Several different techniques of laser surgery for the prostate have been described, the two main energy sources 
are Nd :YAG and holmium:YAG. These procedures can be performed under direct visualization or with 
transrectal ultrasound guidance.  Laser ablation is particularly useful in patients on anticoagulation as bleeding 
risk is minimal.  Similar to other coagulative tec hniques, the prostatic urethra is not immediately 
excised/resected; instead it is sloughed off over the course of a few weeks. Studies suggest that patients 
undergoing Holmium laser enucleation require shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], experience decreased blood lo ss, and 
have similar outcomes to TURP at the expense of increased procedure time [4]. Yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_211990], none of these technologies has been sufficiently effective to displace TURP.  
Pelvic  Embolization  
Non-selective hypogastric artery embolization was originally described as a management option for refractory 
hematuria in 1974 [5] and was subsequently reported in case reports as an emergency treatment for refractory 
hematuria secondary to BPH, adenocarcinoma of the prostate, and post -operative/post -biopsy bleeding [6] [7]. 
Over the past [ADDRESS_759448] been 
published regarding embolization of pelvic tumors, including prostate and bladder cancer, and for bleeding 
after transurethral resection of the prostate. T hese findings are summarized in the table below.

In total, there are 130 patients reported in the case reports and studies listed above. All were pelvic 
embolizations, although with a wide range of pathologies. If one leaves out the study by [CONTACT_212005] [16], which 
included a variety of malignancies in the pelvis, all the other above cases, [ADDRESS_759451] was an investigation published in 1980 by [CONTACT_578107] [19]. Five dogs were 
catheterized and each internal iliac artery embolized with n -butyl -2-cyanoacrylate. This liquid embolic material 
results in complete occlusion of the vessels into which it is injected. After animal sacrifice , pathologic 
examination of the prostate tissue showed no macroscopic changes. Microscopic examination revealed 
infiltration of lympohocytes, histiocytes and fibroblasts in the interstitial tissue. No injuries to other pelvic 
organs were noted.  
A study on 16 healthy male pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] (randomly assigned to embolization or control) investigated sexual function 
after prostate embolization [20]. The treatment arm underwent embolization with 500 -700 micron size tris -acryl 
gelatin microspheres (TAGM), (Embosphere® Microspheres, Biosphere Medical/  Merit Medical, South Jordan 
UT) of animal’s prostatic arterial supply, while the control group underwent prostate arteriography alone. 
Sexual function was evaluated in all the pi[INVESTIGATOR_578096] 3 months after the procedure 
and no diff erence was noted between the groups (p = 0.328). The animals were then sacrificed and the urinary 
bladder, ureters, vas deferens and urethra were normal in all. The treated animals’ prostate glands were smaller 
than the untreated (3.9 ml vs 7.3 ml, p <0.00 1) and pathologically demonstrated arteriolar thickening with 
leukocytic infiltration. There was peri -arteriolar fibrosis, with atrophy of the glandular tissue in most of the 
balance of the gland.   
In a study of prostate embolization in canines, benign pr ostatic hyperplasia was induced using hormones in 9 
beagle dogs [21]. The dogs underwent hormonal stimulation for either 12 or 24 weeks. Five of the 9 beagl es 
were embolized, in all cases with 255 -355 micron size polyvinyl alcohol particles (PVA), (Contour®, [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific, Natick, MA). Half the dogs were hormonally stimulated for 12 weeks and half for 24 weeks. All 
animals that were embolized (5 of the 9)  were treated 12 weeks after the initiation of the hormones and were 
sacrificed 12 weeks after embolization (24 weeks after baseline). In the group stimulated for [ADDRESS_759452]  IRB Number: ________________  
Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  7 change. Those stimulated for 24 weeks who were embolized showed gross evidence of cystic change and 
microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_578097]. The embolic 
material was found in the pe riphery of the gland with inflammatory cell infiltration. Pathologic examination of 
the bladders showed one specimen with focal hemorrhage in the bladder wall, but not involving the entire 
thickness of the bladder. No other bladder injuries were reported.  
A similar study was reported in 2011, again using hormonal stimulation in 10 beagles for 3 months [22].  Seven 
of the ten were randomly selected for embolization with [ADDRESS_759453] symptoms (LUTS) 
secondary to BPH [23].  The gross hematuria resolved immediately after the procedure and follow -up at 12 
months demonstrated a significant reduction in his LUTS as measu red by [CONTACT_83515] (24 to 13).  Further, there 
was a 40% reduction in prostate volume and a decrease in PSA from 40ng/ml to 4ng/mL.  Aside from a 
transient post -operative fever, there were no complications in that patient.  
Recently there have been several sm all clinical trials on patients with BPH refractory to medical management. 
In Brazil, Carnevale et al. performed PAE with 300 -500µm TAGM on two patients with acute urinary retention 
secondary to BPH who were initially managed on α -blocker therapy and ureth ral catheterization [24].  One 
patient was treated with bilateral embolization while the other unilaterally.  Preliminary results with 6 -month 
follow -up demonstrated a 39.7% reduction on US and 47.8% reductio n on MRI in prostate volume from 
baseline in the bilaterally treated patient and 25.5% and 27.8% respectively in the unilaterally treated patient 
with no evidence of complications in either patient. Further follow -up at 18 months demonstrated interval 
increase in prostate size as measured by [CONTACT_212007] (19.6% and 12.2% 
reduction from baseline) while the bilaterally treated patient’s prostate volume remained stable (39.7% and 
53.6% reduction from baseline) relative to 6 -month follow -up.  Both patients reported significant improvement 
in their IPSS and quality of life score at 18 months with the bilaterally treated patient reporting a score that 
decreased from 8 at 1 month follow -up to 1 while the unilaterally treated patien t reported a decrease from 17 to 
7 [25].  
This group has recently presented its most recent results in a total of 12 patients, including the two discussed 
above , at the March 2012 Annual Meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology [26]. All of these patients 
had catheter dependent urinary retention. The procedure was clinically successful in [ADDRESS_759454] -treatment. While no major complicatio ns 
were noted, 3 of 12 had minimal rectal bleeding, 2 of 12 had diarrhea, and focal bladder ischemia in 1 of 12. 
Mean prostate volume reduction was 30% and most had significant improvement in IPSS and QOL scores.  
A clinical study with 15 patients performed  in Portugal was published in early 2011 by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_211996]. utilizing 
200µm non -spherical PVA particles (Cook Inc., Bloomington IN) [27].  Technical success, defined as selective 
prostatic arterial embolization of at least one pelvic side, was achieved in 14 of 15 patients. B ilateral 
embolization was achieved in 13 patients, unilateral in 1 and embolization failed technically in one patient on 
both sides due to vessel tortuosity.  With a mean follow -up of 7.9 months Pi[INVESTIGATOR_211996]. reported a decrease of 
IPSS by a mean of 6.5 poi nts (p=.005 ), improved quality of life score by 1.14 ( p=.065 ), an increase in erectile

Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  8 function score by 1.7 points ( p=0.63 ), a mean decrease in PSA by 2.27ng/mL ( p=.072 ), and a mean prostate 
volume reduction by 26.5mL ( p=.0001 ).  The authors reported a ma jor complication in one patient that 
experienced severe intraoperative pain during embolization and was subsequently found to have a 1.5cm2 area 
of necrosis in the inferior bladder wall requiring surgical repair.  Of the 14 patients that were technically 
successfully treated, only 10 achieved clinical success (defined as an improvement of symptoms with an 
IPSS<20 and/or improvement of Q max to greater than 7mL/sec).  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_211997]’s group also just presented the results of 152 patients at the same SIR meeting in Marc h 2012 [28], 
although these results are not yet published. The procedure was technically successful in 144 of 152 patients. 
Follow -up of betwe en 3 and 30 months was available in 102 patients. Clinical success was noted in 84.3% at 3 
months and in 38 of 46 (82.6%) at [ADDRESS_759455] symptoms

Pre-procedure Patient Evaluation  
Patients may present in o ne of 3 ways: self -referral, referral from urologists or other community physicians or 
referral from the Urology Department. Prior to screening for the study, potential study participant will be 
provided information regarding the study . The informed consen t form will be given to each potential participant 
and consent will be obtained prior to screening.  
 
Once patients agree to proceed and have signed a consent, they will be screened by [CONTACT_578112]: ________________  
Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  [ADDRESS_759462] s and the 
following will be done.  
.  
a. IPSS will be administered  
b. Urine analysis, culture, sensitivity (if indicated)  
c. Blood chemistry (including blood count, BUN, serum creatinine)  
d. A baseline serum prostate specific antigen (PSA).  
e. A focused urologic physical examination, including a rectal exam and trans -rectal ultrasound to detect 
prostate volume.  
f. The patient will complete uroflowmetry, including voided volume (>125cc), total time of voiding, peak 
urine flow rate, average urine flow rate, and post -void residual volume.  
If either physical examination or PSA suggests possible prostate cance r, trans -rectal prostate biopsy will be 
performed.  If prostate cancer is detected, the patient will be excluded.  
 
Provided participants are not excluded based on the above evaluation, at a separate visit, each will have:  
a. Anoscopy and cystoscopy in the urology clinic to ensure that these are normal, without mucosal 
abnormality.  
b. A baseline contrast -enhanced MRI of the prostate will be completed.  
c. The patient will also complete a 5 question sexual function questionnaire, the International Index of 
Erectile Function (IIEF). This questionnaire and the IPSS are described in detail in a later section.  
d. Each patient will have a  consultation visit with one of the interventional radiologist co -investigators. 
The patient will have a focused physical examination, including vascular exam, and will have the 
procedure explained in detail. The procedure will be scheduled at that time.  
Procedure  
During the procedure conscious sedation with intravenous fentanyl and Versed will be provided. Ciprofloxacin 
[ADDRESS_759463] a selective 
internal iliac arteriogram, and as necessary, an arteriogram of the  anterior division of the internal iliac artery 
performed to identify the prostatic arterial supply. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_578098] (also 
known as the prostatic artery), but may have supply from the superior vesicle, the internal pu dental or obturator 
branches as well.  
The prostatic arteries will be selected using standard micro -catheter technique.  Embolization of the prostate 
will be performed with 300 to 500 um sized TAGM (Embosphere ® Microspheres, M erit Medical, South 
Jordan, UT) . The embolization endpoint will be absence of the normal blush of the prostate on post 
embolization angiography and stasis of fl ow in the prostate arteries.  
After the catheters are removed, hemostasis will be ac hieved with manual compression.  
Post-Procedu re Care  
As the primary outcome is safety, each patient will be admitted for observation and  short -term recovery 
overnight. Analgesics will be provided via IV PCA. During the observation period , each will be assessed on the 
severity of pain occurring during  the first 24 hours after treatment using a visual analogue scale (VAS) 
administered by [CONTACT_327811].  The assessment sheet will include a 10 cm linear VAS scale along with 
subjective questions regarding the patients’ degree of other symptoms, sp ecifically rectal pain or bleeding, pain 
with urination or gross hematuria. After discharge, the patients will be called the next day to review symptom 
status and to screen for complications.

Outcome Assessment Measures  
Laboratory Assessment  
The safety of the therapy will be monitored in part using laboratory analyses, including CBC, serum chemistry, 
urinalysis, ur ine culture and PSA. Of these, the urine testing is directed at assessing bladder function, while 
PSA trending will be an important outcome measure of prostate status.  
Urine Flowmetry  
Several tools have been developed to evaluate severity of LUTS and to tr ack disease progression and response 
to therapy.  Urine flowmetry, which includes voided volume (>125cc), total time of voiding, peak urine flow 
rate (Q max), average urine flow rate, and post void urinary volume, provides an objective measure of urinary 
function and will be measured in this study [29].   
Symptom and quality of life assessment  
While urinary symptoms are increased in larger prostates, prostate size does not always predict severity of 
symptoms. Many patients with enlarged prostates do not have symptoms and therefore no therapy other than 
Georgetown University Institutional Review Board  IRB Number: ________________  
Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  14 watchful waiting is indicated.  
To provide a  means of assessing symptom severity, the AUA symptom index and International Prostate 
Symptom Score (IPSS) have been developed and validated and have become important clinical tools directing 
management of LUTS attributed to BPH [30, 31].  These are self -administered questionnaires that assess the 
severity of symptoms including frequency, nocturia, urgency, incomplete emptying, intermittency, straining, 
and a weak stream. The questionnaires only differ in that the IPSS has an added quality of life question and for 
this reason that will be the questionnaire we use in this study. The IPSS asks patients to quant ify the severity of 
these symptoms on a scale from 0 -5 with a total overall score ranging from 0 -35.  A symptom score of 0 -7 is 
considered mild  symptoms , 8-19 moderate, and 20 -35 severe. The IPSS also includes a quality of life (QoL) 
question asking “If yo u were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, 
how would you feel about that?” with a scale ranging from 0 -6 (terrible to delighted ). 
Erectile dysfunction is a key concern with prostate surgery and may be with pro state embolization as well. A 
standard questionnaire used for assessing erectile function is the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) 
[32] and a short 5 question version of this questionnaire (IIEF -5) has been developed and validated [33] and 
this is the version that will be used in this study.  
Visual inspection of the bladder and rectal mucosa  
Both cystoscopy and anoscopy will be used before and [ADDRESS_759464] imaging for  the clinical assessment of the prostate gland [29]. 
Having said that, MRI can provide a more comprehensive assessment of the prostate size and tissue viability. 
Contrast -enhanced MRI provides a perfusion “map” of the pr ostate and allows the determination of the extent 
of infarction (or non -perfusion) of the prostate. The preliminary work in both Lisbon and Sao Paulo suggests 
that the greater the degree of de -vascula rization of the prostate, the greater the volume reducti on. This is likely 
to correlate with symptom improvement, although this requires confirmation. We believe that this study will 
provide preliminary data that can be used to help design studies to test  that hypothesis.  
Adverse Events  
Each adverse event will be recorded as they occur. Each will be categorized as to type and severity using the 
Society of Interventional Radiology  (SIR)  definitions of adverse events based on outcome. That classification is 
as follows:  
Type  Class  Definition  
Minor  A No therapy, no  consequence  
 B Nominal therapy, no consequence; includes overnight 
admission for observation only.  
Major  C Require therapy, minor hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (<48 hours).  
 D Require major therapy, unplanned increase in level of 
care, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>48  hours).  
 E Permanent adverse sequelae.  
 F Death.  
Analysis  
The primary outcome is the absence of complications to the bladder, rectum or other pelvic structures detected 
in the first week after therapy. Each patient will be judged free of these adverse events or not. For those with an 
adverse event, the complication will be scored using the SIR definitions. Descriptive statistics will be used to 
summarize these events, along with patient demographics and initial clinical status.  
Georgetown University Institutional Review Board  IRB Number: ________________  
Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  15 Appropriate parametric and non -parametric tests will be used to assess change in laboratory measures, urine 
flowmetry parameters, and scores from the IPSS and IIEF. Changes in prostate volumes and the estimated 
volume of devascularized tissue will be calcu lated for each patient and outcomes from the different embolics 
will be compared. Appropriate paired parametric and non -parametric tests will be used to determine statistical 
significance. A p value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 
Statistical Considerations (justification for sample size or “n”, power or degree of change):  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize these events, along with patient demographics and initial 
clinical status.  
Appropriate parametric and non -paramet ric tests will be used to assess change in Q Max flow, IPSS, IIEF and 
the SF -36. Changes in prostate volumes and the estimated volume of devascularized tissue will be calculated.  
Relative importance/value of the trial, considering “standard” therapy and c ompeting trials : 
An alternative procedure to surgery with durable results would be beneficial to patients with LUTS who cannot 
tolerate medical therapy or cannot have surgery performed for other comorbidities.

This is a Phase I -II safety study focused on the local risks in the pelvis of this procedure. While there are other 
potential risks due to the iodinated contrast, arterial puncture and the passage of the catheters within the vessels, 
these risks are very l ow, well less than 5% and no greater than for any other arteriographic procedure. Other 
potential risks related to an embolization procedure include the risk of conscious sedation and radiation 
exposure. We anticipate this procedure taking on average about  [ADDRESS_759465] that the risk  of complication  is low,  with the risk of a serious 
complication is extremely low (less than 1% chance)  but that is based on clinical experience and not careful 
assessment of the rectum and bladder. This is the main focus of our study  
Based on the reported data to date  and known potential complications of angiographic procedures , the 
following are potential risks of the procedure:  
Related to the embolization of the prostate:  Minor or self -limited complications: burnin g in the urethra, urinary 
Georgetown University Institutional Review Board  IRB Number: ________________  
Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  16 infection, hematuria, hematospermia, hemorrhage, vasospasm, rectorrhagia, pain  in the pelvis , or allergic 
reaction to embolic material.  
More serious complications rela ted to embolization of the prostate:  bladder or bladder neck ne crosis,  possibly 
requiring surgical resection. Bladder ischemia causing severe pain, but resolving without complication. Other 
than the one case of surgical resection of the bladder in Lisbon, all reported complications have resolved with 
minimal or no the rapy. 
Complications related to angiography: arterial injury, which in rare instances (<1%) can lead to need for 
surgical repair of the artery, arterial injury in the pelvis, puncture site hemato ma and al lergic reaction to the 
contrast media.  
Radiation inju ry to the skin of the buttocks - this complication is not yet reported but is possible with prolonged 
procedures.  
 
Risk Minimization  
As noted above, great care will be taken with the use of X -ray exposure to minimize dose. Similarly, each 
patient will be ev aluated pre -procedure for sedation risk according to the standard of care and will be followed 
by [CONTACT_578113].  
 
Each significant injury to a patient’s bladder or rectum will be reported immediately to the IRB staff. Those 
with lesser injuries will be recorded and followed to resolution. All minor and major complications will be 
summarized after each set of 10 patients and reported to the IRB. We currently plan to stop the study for re -
evaluation of its over all safety if more than 20% of patients assessed after the first 10 patients (and each 
subsequent group of 10 patients) suffers either a bladder or rectal injury requiring surgical intervention.  
 
We do not believe a data safety and monitoring committee is needed as our urology co -investigators will serve 
the role of safety monitors. They have a strong incentive to identify injuries, as they do not perform this 
procedure and it has the potential to compete with traditional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . While our urology collea gues are 
interested in providing alternatives to TURP for their patients, they have no interest in a therapy that is not safe.

Form AB -1 (2007/07/05)  17 Prostate enlargement (medically known as benign prostatic hyperplasia) is due to overgrowth of the prostate

sedated. After local anesthesia, the artery at the top of the leg is entered with a catheter (a thin long tube), which 
is then advanced into the arteries feeding the prostate gland. Small beads are injected into the arteries to block 
the blood supply to  the prostate tissue, ca using that tissue  to shrivel and shrink. The procedure takes from [ADDRESS_759466]  IRB Number: ________________

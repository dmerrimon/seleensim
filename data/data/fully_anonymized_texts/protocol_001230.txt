2 1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  A multi -center, randomized, double blind, parallel -arm, placebo controlled 
trial of mepolizumab for treatment of adults and adolescents with acti ve 
eosinophilic esophagitis and dysphagia -predominant symptoms  
Study Des cription : This multi -center, randomized, double blind, parallel -arm, placebo 
controlled trial will determine whether mepolizumab is more effective 
than  placebo for improving symptoms of dysphagia  and decreasing  
esophageal eosinophil counts in adults and adolescents with active 
eosinophilic esophagitis after an initial 3-month treatment course and  will 
also assess the impact of an additional 3-months of treatment . 
Objectives:  
 Primary Objectives:  
1. To determine whether mepolizumab is more effective than 
placebo for improving symptoms  of dysphagia as measured by [CONTACT_851618] (EEsAI) 
in adults and adolescents with active eosinophilic esophagitis after a 3-month treatment course.  
2. To determine whether mepolizumab is more effective than placebo for decreasing  esophageal eosinophil counts in adults and 
adolescents with active eosinophilic esophagitis  after a 3-month 
treatment course.  
 Secondary Objectives:   
1. To determine predictors of symp tomatic and histologic response 
to mepolizumab treatment,  including potential biomarkers.  
2. To assess durability of symptomatic and histologic response to mepolizumab after 6 months  of treatment in patients initially 
randomized to the active medication (this includes a 3- month 
blinded second phase of treatment).  
3. To assess histologic response  to a lower dose of mepolizumab 
treatment in patients initially  randomized to the placebo arm (this 
will be in a 3- month blinded second phase); symptom  response 
will also be assessed in this phase.  
4. To assess safety of mepo lizumab over 3 and 6 months  of 
treatmen t (this includes both 3-month study phases).  
Outcomes : Primary Outcome : 
1. Mean  change in dysphagia as measured by [CONTACT_851619] ( 7-day 
recall) from baseline to 3-months post -treatment.  
Secondary Outcome s:  
1. Proportion  of patients who have clinical remission as defined by [CONTACT_851620] ≤20.  
2. Proportion  of patient s who have a clinical response, as defined by 
[CONTACT_851621] ≥ 20 points.  
3. Absolute  peak eosinophil count  (measured in eos/hpf) after 3-
months of treatment.  
4. Levels of histologic response after 3- months of treatment 
including < 15, ≤ 6, and ≤ 1  eos/hpf.  
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
3 5. Mean change in severity of endoscopic findings as measured by 
[CONTACT_851622] (EREFS) from baseline to 3-
months post -treatment.  
6. Mean change in the Straumann Dysphagia Instrument (SDI) from 
baseline to 3-months post -treatment. 
Prespecified Exploratory Outcomes  
1. Mean change in peripheral blood eosinophil levels from baseline 
to 3-months post  treatment . 
2. For patients initially randomized to active medication, the same set of outcomes (as listed above) will be  assessed after 6 month s 
of treatment.  
3. For patients initially randomized to placebo, a paired analysis will be conducted to  compare month 6 to month 3  outcomes.  
4. For the same set of outcomes  (as listed above) , 3-month data for 
patients initially randomized to active medication (300mg monthly) will be compared to [ADDRESS_1184083] completed 3-months of 
100mg monthly.  This will provide a comparison of the 300mg to 
the 100mg dose.  
5. Adverse events and safety during all time points in the study.

7 2 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a Th2 -mediated allergic disease whereby [CONTACT_851625], progressive esophageal stenosis, and food 
impaction.1-[ADDRESS_1184086] 1 in 2000.6, 7, 10-13 Overall, between 5% and 23% of patients undergoing 
endoscopy for dysph agia will have EoE,14- 18 and more than 50% of patients presenting to an emergency 
room with food impaction are now diagnosed with EoE.3, 19 Because of this large burden of diseas e, 
health care costs of EoE are also significant, accounting for more than $1  billion annually.20 
 
There is currently an urgent need for new treatments for EoE . There are no medications that are Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved for EoE,[ADDRESS_1184087], results 
are lacking. For example, up to 50% of patients do not have histologic response to these medications,[ADDRESS_1184088] of steroids in responders may wane over time.28 Moreover, 
these medications are not specific to  the known pathogenesis of EoE.29 
 
The cytokine IL -5 has been shown to play a major role in EoE pathogenesis.30, 31 IL-5 is increased in 
patients with EoE, leads to production of IL -13, which in turn stimulates the esophageal epi[INVESTIGATOR_851591] -3, a potent chemokine that recruits eosinophils to the esophagus.32 In experimental 
models of EoE, blocking IL -5 atte nuates the disease state, where as overexpression of IL -5 creates an 
EoE- like phenotype.31, 33 Mepolizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds IL -5 and has 
been demonstrated to be highly effective i n eosinophilic diseases such as hypereosinophilic syndrome  
(HES) ,[ADDRESS_1184089] recently  eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.37 
Because of its mechanism of action, mepolizumab is a highly promising therapeutic agent for EoE, and  
has previously been studied in this condition. A small randomized clinical trial (RCT) in [ADDRESS_1184090] (55% decrease in mean tissue eosinophil levels in the  mepolizumab arm vs 7% 
decrease in the placebo arm), but variable symptom response.[ADDRESS_1184091] ( peak eosinophil count decreased from 118 
eosinophils per high -power field [eos/hpf] to 24 eos/hpf in the 2.5 mg/kg arm), but symptoms were 
relatively mild at baseline and there was  no clear overall trend towards improvement.[ADDRESS_1184092] 
in the fie ld.
41 This includes the need to focus on a single primary symptom, enroll a homogeneous set of 
patients with highly active disease, account for esophageal remodeling (severe esophageal strictures or 
narrowing), and restrict baseline esophageal dilation. These latter two points are particularly important 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1184093] design for EoE  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], an d the development and validation of EoE -
specific patient -reported outcomes (PR O), it is imperative to revisit mepolizumab treatment for EoE 
using an optimized clinical trial design and a validated PRO. Our overall hypothesis is that mepolizumab will improv e symptoms of dysp hagia, as measured by a validated PRO, in adolescents and adults with 
EoE, as well as improve esophageal eosinophilia, as compared to placebo.
 
 
2.2 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.2.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
There are several potential risks or discomforts involved with being in this study.  These are outlined 
below. There may be uncommon or previously unknown risks.  
 Mepolizumab risks: Hypersensitivity reactions ( e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria, rash) 
have occurred following administration of mepolizumab . These reactions generally occur within hours of 
administration but in some instances can have a delayed onset ( i.e., days). In the  event of a 
hypersensitivity reaction, mepolizumab will be discontinued.  
 The most common adverse reactions (≥3% and more common than placebo) reported in the first 24 weeks of 2 clinical trials  for severe asthma  with mepolizumab (and placebo) were: headac he, 19% (18%); 
injection site reaction, 8% (3%); back pain, 5% (4%); fatigue, 5% (4%); influenza, 3% (2%); urinary tract infection, 3% (2%); abdominal pain upper, 3% (2%); pruritus, 3% (2%); eczema, 3% (<1%); and muscle spasm, 3% (<1%).  
 Systemic Reactions , including Hypersensitivity Reactions:  In 3 clinical trials, 3% of subjects who received 
100 mg of mepolizumab  experienced systemic (allergic and nonallergic) reactions, compared to 5% in 
the placebo group . Up to 6%  (2% in HES, 6% in EGPA) of subjects who  received 300mg of mepolizumab 
experienced systemic (allergic and nonallergic) reactions, compared to up to 1 % (0% HES; 1% EGPA) in 
the placebo group .  
 Systemic allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were reported by 1% of subjects who received 100mg of 
mepolizumab , compared to 2% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, pruritus, 
headache, and myalgia. In EGPA and HES trials using 300mg of mepolizumab, rates of systemic 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were 4% (1% placebo) and 0% (0%), respectively. Manifestations included rash, pruritus, flushing, fatigue, hypertension, warm sensation in trunk and neck, cold 
extremities, dyspnea, a nd stridor .  
 
Systemic nonallergic reactions were reported by 2% of subjects who received 100mg of mepolizumab  
and 3% of subjects in the placebo group. Manifestations included rash, flushing, and myalgia. A majority 
of the systemic reactions were experienced on the day of dosing.  In EGPA and HES trials using 300mg of 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
9 mepolizumab, rates of systemic nonallergic reac tions were 1% (0% placebo) and 2% (0%), respectively. 
Manifestations observed included angioedema  (EGPA) and multifocal skin reaction (HES).  
 
Injection site reactions ( e.g., pain, erythema, swelling, itching, burning sensation) have been reported at 
a rate of 8% in subjects treated with 100mg of mepolizumab , compared with 3% in subjects treated with 
placebo.  In trials using a 300mg dose of mepolizumab, injection site reactions have been reported at a 
rate of 15% (13%) in clinical trials for Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis  and at 7% (4%) in 
clinical trials for Hypereosinophilic Syndrome.  
 In controlled clinical trials, [ADDRESS_1184094] not been performed. Published literature using animal models suggests 
that IL -5 and eosinophils are part of an early inflammatory reaction at the site of tumorigenesis and can 
promote tumor rejecti  on. However, other reports indicate that eosinophil infiltration into tumors can 
promote tumor growth. Therefore, the malignancy risk in humans from an antibody to IL -5 such as 
mepolizumab is unknown .  
 When reducing concomitant steroids and/or  immunosuppressant treatment, the potential to unmask 
malignancies should be  considered in the management of any subject receiving mepolizumab.  Subjects 
with lymphoproliferative  HES or those with an abnormal T -cell phenotype are at  increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] T -cell lymphoma as part of the natural history of the disease.  T-cell lymphoma has been 
reported in HES patients receiving mepolizumab. It is not  known if the risk of T -cell ly mphoma in 
susceptible patients is increased by [CONTACT_851626]. The risk 
benefit in these patients should  be considered prior to initiation and/or continuation of treatment with 
mepolizumab . 
 
Mepolizumab is considered to  have a low potential for drug- drug interactions because it  selectively 
binds and neutralizes the cytokine IL -5. There are no reports of IL -[ADDRESS_1184095] version of the package insert (study Investigator Brochure).  
EGD with biopsy risks:  
The endoscopy is a well- established procedure with a very low rate of complications.  Endoscopy and 
biopsy are the best methods for monitoring EoE disease activity.  People with EoE may normally need 
repeated endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_851592].  Briefly , risks include  mild  discom fort due to gagging while the tube is 
passed down the throat.  Subjects may  also experience mild sore throat, chest pain or discomfort, 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
10 abdominal pain or discomfort, or painful or difficult swallowing following the procedure. Medicines may 
ease these  problems.  Rare risks from an endoscopy include bleeding and infection.  There is a very small 
risk (about 3 in 10,000) of esophageal perforation that could require  surgery to repair and a similarly 
small risk (8 in 10,000) of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_851593].   
 The number of biopsies taken for this study is within the spectrum of routine clinical practice for esophageal diseases and EoE in particular.  Nevertheless, there is a  very small risk of perforation or 
significant bleeding that would require a blood transfusion or other measures to stop the bleeding.  To 
minimize this risk, subjects will be monitored for  any bleeding during the biopsy portion of the 
procedure, and if bleeding is heavy, clinically indicat ed actions to stop the bleeding will be performed, 
and further biopsy procurement will be stopped.  
 There is a risk of  adverse reaction to the anesthetic or medication used for the endoscopy.  These 
reactions may require treatment. There may be inflammat ion of the vein through which medication is 
given.  Subjects with asthma have  an increased risk for problems with the anesthesia.  An adverse 
reaction to the medications used for the endoscopy can include  difficulty breathing, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826], low blo od pressure, slow heart, excessive sweating, spasms in the larynx, an allergic 
reaction, such as hives and itching or anaphylaxis.  
 After the endoscopy, subjects may experience  pain in the throat or neck, vomiting, black or bloody 
stools, pain in the ches t or abdomen, or fever.  
 Venipuncture risks:  
There is a small risk of fainting or bruising and a 1/1000 risk of infection at the site where the blood is 
drawn.  
 
Loss of confidentiality:  
There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1184096] recently eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis.37 Because of its mechanism of action, mepolizumab is a highly promising therapeutic agent 
for EoE, and  has previously been studied in this condition. A small randomized clinical trial (RCT) in [ADDRESS_1184097] (55% decrease in mean tissu e eosinophil levels in the  
mepolizumab arm vs 7% decrease in the placebo arm), but variable symptom response.[ADDRESS_1184098] ( peak eosinophil 
count decreased from 118 eosin ophils per high -power field [eos/hpf] to 24 eos /hpf in the 2.5 mg/kg 
arm), but symptoms were relatively mild at baseline and there was  no clear overall trend towards 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
11 improvement.39 In this study, it is likely that mepolizumab will decrease blood and tissue  eosinophil 
counts, and we hypothesize that this will also decrease clinical symptoms of dysphagia.  
 
2.2.3  ASSESSMENT OF PO TENTIAL RISKS AND 
BENEFITS  
Because the prior studies of this medication in adults and adolescents (who are the target population for 
this s tudy) have been very small and did not require a symptom threshold for entry, we feel that the 
current study as designed is require d to assess efficacy of this drug.  The potential value of information 
gained, specifically related to a novel therapy for EoE that can be applied for highly symptomatic, and potentially refractory patients, is the basis for exposure to the potential risks of the study.  Risks will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_851627]  (AEs), as well as close monitoring during and after study drug administration.  Finally, the 
inclusion of a placebo arm is justifiable as there are currently no FDA -approved medications for EoE, and 
the 3-month long placebo period is very short given the chronic nature of EoE (for example, many 
patients have a symptom duration of 5- 10 years prior to diagnosis).
 
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES  
 
OBJECTIVES  OUTCOMES  JUSTIFICATION FOR OUTCOMES  
To determine whether 
mepolizumab is more effective than placebo for improving symptoms of dysphagia as measured by [CONTACT_851628] (EEsAI) in adults and adolescents with active 
eosinophilic esophagitis after a 3-
month treatment course.  
 3-month EEsAI score  The EEsAI is a validated and responsive 
PRO, developed by [CONTACT_851629],  that measures 
dysphagia frequency, dysphagia severity, and food avoidance/modification behaviors, in patients wit h EoE.
42, 45-[ADDRESS_1184099] 3- month blinded phase, there will be a second 3-month blinded phase where all patients 
receive active medication, but the dose wi ll be lower in the subjects initially randomized to the placebo 
arm.  
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1184100] obs ervation  in a clinical setting to ensur e proper administration and 
compliance. Each visit will also provide an opportunity for symptom questionnaires to be completed and 
for blood samples to be drawn. After 3-months (the time point where the primary outcome is assessed), 
all subjects initially randomized to active treatment will continue with mepolizumab dosing 300  mg SQ 
monthly and  will remain blinded. All subjects initially randomized to placebo wi ll receive mepolizumab 
100mg SQ monthly and  will remain blinded.  
 Of note, no dietary c hanges, dilations, changes in baseline PPI [INVESTIGATOR_851594], changes in inhaled or 
intranasal steroid do ses, or administration or oral, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/swallowed, or systemic steroids will be 
allowed during the study  period  (from consent  through the end of treatmen t period ). Subjects will 
undergo endoscopy after the first blinded phase (at 3 month s) and after the second blinded phase (after 
6 month s). 
4.[ADDRESS_1184101] ive for improving symptoms and  histology in EoE, a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial is necessary.  The inclusion of a placebo arm is 
justifiable as there are currently no FDA -approved medications for EoE, and the 3- month long placebo 
period is very short given the chronic nature of EoE (for example, many patients have a symptom duration of 5 -10 years prior to diagnosis). 
 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1184102] been chosen based on pharmacologic modelling showing that 100 -300 mg of 
mepolizumab, administered SQ on a monthly basis, is sufficien t to suppress eosinophil counts in the 
blood,44 and that this oft en correlates with decreased tissue eosinophi lia as well (personal 
communication, Isabelle Pouliquen). However, prior studies of EoE used much higher does (750mg -
1500mg;38 2.5-10mg/kg39), and dose -response of me polizumab for EoE treatment and histologic 
response in esophageal tissue is not known. To bride  the existing pharmacologic and clinical data, we 
have selected the 300mg dose for compar ison to placebo for the primary outcome in the first blinded 
phase of the study, but will also gain resp onse informat ion on the [ADDRESS_1184103] scheduled procedure shown in the S chedule of Activities (SoA),

one esophageal level. *** 
4. Biopsies from the stomach and duodenum that have ruled out alternative etiologies in all 
children and in adults with abnormal endoscopic findings or when other gastric or small 
intestinal conditions are clinical possibilities . If these samples have been obtained during a 
previous endoscopic evaluation and in the judgement of the site -Investigator the patient has not 
had a clinically significant change that would merit repeat gastric/duodenal biopsies, then prior normal gastric and duodenal biopsies are acceptable to exclude alternate etiologies.  
5. Active symptoms of dysphagia with more than 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_851595] a period of 2 weeks 
during the screening period, and an Eosinophilic Esophagitis Sympto m Activity Index (EEsAI; see 
below for details) score of ≥ 27 at baseline. **** 
6. Able to read, comprehend, and sign consent form.  
7. Have maintained a stable diet for 6 weeks prior to enrollment. ***** 
8. Able to maintain a stable diet throughout the duration of the study period.  ***** 
9. Female subjects of childbearing potential who have had their first menses agree to use a highly 
effective method of birth control during the study and for [ADDRESS_1184107] dose of study drug.  Female subjects with r eproductive potential who are using s ystemic contraceptives (e.g., 
oral contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, implantable/insertable hormonal contraceptive 
products, or transdermal patches)  to prevent pregnancy  must have stable  use for ≥28 days prior 
to screening.  See section 5.3 for additional details.  
 
* The rationale for this criterion is that adole scents and adults with EoE have a very similar clinical 
presentation with dysphagia -predominant symptoms.

total per day or higher) of any approved PPI [INVESTIGATOR_851596] . The length of the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_851597]/allergy will be determined 
according to the local clinical standard of care.  
***The rationale for this criterion is to ensure high levels of esophageal eosinophilia at baseline . For this 
study,  baseline symptoms are gathered during the screening visit and used as baseline measurements.   
**** The rationale for this criterion is to ensure that highly symptomatic patients are enrolled ; based on 
this threshold and prior data related to the EEsAI, we  would expect baseline scores for this patient 
population in the 50 -60 range.  
**** * As dietary restriction is a known effective treatment for EoE, and signs and symptoms of EoE may 
be highly dependent on eating behaviors, patients should maintain a stable diet for at least 6 weeks 
preceding enrollment and throughout the duration of the study period.

F), protected from light.  The recommended storage condition and expi[INVESTIGATOR_851602], are 
stated on the product labels.  Aseptic  techniques must be used at all times when preparing this sterile 
product for  administration.  
 
Study drug should not be given to subjects if febrile (temperature of 100.4F/38C or greater) . Study drug 
can be administered upon resolution of fever and approval by [CONTACT_779] -investigator. Dosing may also be 
withheld if there are other patient concerns and at the discretion of site-i nvestigators . 
 
The drug product does not contain a preservative. Therefore,  it is considered a single dose  product. The 
reconstituted solution should be kept at refrigerated or controlled room  temperature (up to 25 °C). It 
should be used as soon as possible and any unused solution  remaining after 8 hours should be 
discarded . 
 All subjects will receive 3 subcutaneous injections  at each dosing visit . The 3 injections will be : 3 
injections of 100mg mepolizumab  each , or 3 injections of placebo, or 2 injections of placebo and one 
injection of 100mg mepolizumab depending on randomization and study visit (a t the 3-month visit, 
subjects previously receiving placebo will receive 100mg of mepolizumab ). The relation to meals is not 
important with this medication.

protected from light . 
 
6.2.4  PREPARATION  AND ADMINISTRATION  
Preparation:  
1. Study drug should be reconstituted and administered by a healthcare professional.   
2. Reconstitute study drug in the vial with 1.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP,  preferably 
using a 2 - or 3-mL syringe and a 16, 19, or 21-gauge needle. The reconstituted solution will  
contain a concentration of 100 mg/mL mepolizumab  or [ADDRESS_1184118] the stream of Sterile Water for Injection vertically onto the center of the lyophilized  cake. 
Gently swirl the vial for 10 sec onds with a circular motion at 15 -second intervals until  the 
powder is dissolved.  Note: Do not shake the reconstituted solution during the procedure as this 
may lead to  product foaming or precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332]. Reconstitution is typi[INVESTIGATOR_851603] 5 
minutes  after  the Sterile Water for Injection has been added, but it may take additional time.  
4. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute study drug, swirl at  [ADDRESS_1184119] not be  
administered.  
6. If the reco nstituted solution is not used immediately , the reconstituted solution should be kept 
at refrigerated or controlled room temperature (up to 25°C). It should be used as soon as possible and any unused solution remaining after 8 hours should be discarded . 
 
Administration:  
1. For SC administration, preferably using three 1- mL polypropylene syringe s fitted with a  
disposable 21 - to 27 -gauge x 0.5 -inch (13 -mm) needle.  
2. Obtain subject vitals prior to dosing.  If febrile, do not dose.  
3. Site pharmacies should supply [ADDRESS_1184120] foaming or  
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332]. 
Administer three 1-mL injection s of study drug subcutaneously . Each 1mL injection should be 
administered at separate sites into  the upper arm, thigh, abdomen , or other appropriate location  
(rotating the injection site each time), avoiding any blood vessels, thickening or tenderness of skin, scares fibrous tissue, stretch marks, bruising, redness, nevi, or other skim imperfection . Location will 
depend on the specific subject and body habitus, and all three injections need not be in the same area of the body.  Injection should be far enough apart to ensure the same site is not injected on more than 
one occasion. Injection site will be noted by [CONTACT_851631].  
 
Safety Monitoring:  
1. Vital signs will be obtained prior to dosing.  
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
19 2. After completion of dosing, subjects will remain on -site to be  monitored  for 1 hour . During this 
time, vital signs will be checked 5, 30, and 60 minutes after injection , and injection sites 
monitored for adverse reactions.  This applies to all dosing visits  (initial and subsequent).  
3. Subjects will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]  48 hours after injection to assess for AEs . 
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either mepolizumab or a placebo injection.  Randomization will be 
administered centrally but  will be at the level of the site using a blocked randomization protocol with 
computer -generated variable block sizes.  At each site, patients will be categorized as either a prior 
steroid non -responder or not , and then will be randomized within that categorization . The 
investigational pharmacy at each site will then receive the randomization information and provide study 
drugs. Alloca tion will be concealed from all investigators, subjects, and data analysts . The study monitor 
will be unblinded to treatment assignments and can escalate issues to the medical monitor who can be 
unblinded if necessary  (e.g. in the event of a safety concern  or DSMB request ). Of note, we will balance 
the groups for prior steroid non -response but  will not be formally stratifying on this variable  for power 
calculations or analysis purposes . Steroid non -response is defined as greater than 15 eos/hpf after a 2-
month  course of a swallowed/topi[INVESTIGATOR_851604] a standard dose (standard dose =  2mg/d of budesonide 
or 1760 mcg/d of fluticasone) . 
 This is a double -blind study. Subjects, investigators, endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], nurses, statisticians, and study staff 
will all be masked as to allocation. To maintain the study blind, only unblinded pharmacist(s) at the 
investigational pharmacy at each site will dispense study drug. The medication will be mixed by [CONTACT_851632], and only blinded syringes with “study drug” will be provided to use in the study.  These will either have the correct active dose of mepolizumab or a matched normal saline 
placebo.  In the first blinded phase, subjects randomized to mepolizumab will receive three injections 
with active medication, and subjects randomized to placebo will receive three injections with placebo.  In 
the second blinded phase, subjects who were initially randomized to mepolizumab will continue to receive three injections of active medication.  However, subjects who were initially randomized to 
placebo will receive one injection of mepolizumab and [ADDRESS_1184121] who analyzes the tissue eosinophil counts will enter 
the data directly into the data management system or can provide the results to the study monitor for 
entry into the data management system . 
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
Compliance with study drug  will be recorded on a  Case Report Form  (CRF) by [CONTACT_851633].  This study will utilize electronic CRFs (eCRFs). As the 
medication is injected subcutaneously in an observed situation on a monthly basis, we can ensure intervention compliance.

20 6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a 
properly authorized/licensed clinician. M edications to be reported in the e CRF are concomitant 
prescription medications, over the counter  medications,  and supplements . 
 
6.5.1  PROHIBITED TREATMENTS  
No dietary changes, dilations, changes in baseline PPI [INVESTIGATOR_851594], changes in inhaled or intranasal steroid doses, or administration or oral, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/swallowed, or systemic steroids will be allowed during 
the study period (from consent through the end of treatment period ). Esophageal dilation at the 
screening or month [ADDRESS_1184122]’s physician.  However, if such medications  or treatments  are required, the 
participant would be considered a trea tment failure and would exit the study . If this happens, and at the 
discretion of the site-I nvestigator or sponsor- investigator it is safe and feasible to do so, the subject 
should return for an early termination  visit.   
 Although the use of rescue medications i s allowable at any time during the study, if safe and feasible to 
do so the use of rescue medications should be dela yed until either the 3- month or 6-month  assessments  
are completed . Rescue medications or treatments administered after the mont h [ADDRESS_1184123] be recorded.

During the screening endoscopy,  esophageal  biopsies will be obtained from the following locations:  
• Distal esophagus (3 -5 cm above the Z- line/ squamo -columnar juncti on) 
• Proximal esophagus ( ~15 cm above the Z line and within 10 cm of the esophageal inlet ) 
 Up to 6 esophageal biopsies will be obtained from each location , focusing on areas of endoscopic 
abnormalities, if present . Biopsies  to determine eligibility  will be immediately shipped to a Central Lab 
for analysis.  
 Additionally, all children (<18 years of age) will have additional biopsies from the stomach (up to 4: 2 from the antrum and 2 from the gastric body) and duodenu m (up to 4) taken to rule out alternative 
etiologies. Similarly, adults ( ≥18 years of age) with abnormal endoscopic findings or cases where other 
gastric or small intestinal considerations are clinical possibilities will have biopsies taken from the stomach, duodenum, and/or other targeted areas to rule out alternative etiologie s.

 In addition to obtaining the eosinophil counts required for inclusion in the trial and outcome  
determination, the esophageal biopsies will be used for evaluation of potential diagnostic and pharmacodynamic markers using appropriate laboratory methodology, including  but not limited to  
other histopathologic findings , immunohistochemistry, and transcript profiling.  Samples may also be 
used for future unspecified studies.  
 If deemed eligible, then b iopsies and EoE Endoscopic Reference Score (EREFS) from the screening EGD 
will also be used as baseline . For this study, baseline  symptoms gathere d during the screening vi sit are  
used as baseline measurements .
 
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1184127] E COLLECTION  
During the screening phase, complete blood count (CBC) with  differential  will be obtained  to determine 
the baseline peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count.  
 Screening CBC  with differential will be analy zed by [CONTACT_851638]. Subsequent CBC  with differential will be sent to a Central Lab for 
analysis and sites will be blinded to results unless abnormal. Blood samples should be obtained on the 
same day as the EGD.  
 
In addition, on the day of the screening/baseline EGD, a serum sample will be obtained for anti- IL 5 as a 
baseline measure. Baseline  symptoms are gathered during the screening visit and used as baseline 
measurements. Serum will be sent to the lead site for processing and storage.

8.8 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.8.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
8.8.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE ) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
site-investigator or sponsor  (UNC) , it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon a ppropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1184131] values which may be clinically significant, based on 
his/her medical judgment and the clinical setting, the  site-investigator will determine whether to repeat 
the tests and should follow up as appropriate until they have returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  
 All abnormal laboratory values or test results should not necessarily be reported as AEs.  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE 
inclu de the following:  
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms (e.g., low red blood cell count [anemia] is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_29429], shortness of breath, etc.)  
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
3. Test r esult leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the trial, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
4. Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_81120]-investigator or sponsor -investigator. 
 Merely repeating an abnor mal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute 
an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error should not be reported as an AE.  
 
8.8.4  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) , version 5.0 to assess 
all AEs. For AEs not included in the CTCAE grading system , the following criteria will be used to describe 
severity  of the AE: 
 
• Grade 1 Mild ; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated .  
• Grade 2 Moderate ; minimal, local,  or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL).  Instrumen tal ADL refer to preparing 
meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
• Grade 3 Severe ; medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self- care ADL.  Self-care ADL refer to 
bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
• Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed by [CONTACT_851640]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1184132].  
 
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence t o suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention  administration and cannot be 
explaine d by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
study intervention  (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. 
• Possibly  Related  –There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after admin istration of the study intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definitio n. 
“Possibly Related” means the reasonable possibility that the adverse event, incident, experience 
or outcome may have been associated with the procedures involved in the research (modified from the definition of associated with use of the drug in FDA reg ulations at 21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
Reasonable possibility means that the event is more likely than not related to participation in the research or, in other words, there is a >50% likelihood that the event is related to the research procedures.   
• Somewhat Likely to be  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., 
the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the pa rticipant ’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events)  so there is a <50% likelihood that the event is related to 
the research procedures. Although an AE  may rate only as “ somewhat likely to be  related” soon 
after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “possibly  related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be Related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention  administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention  administration, and/ or 
evidence  exists that the event is definitely related  to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The site-i nvestigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected.  An 
AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
8.8.5  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT 
ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
29 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for S AEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  eCRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, investigator’s  
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while 
on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time  that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.   
  Changes in the severity of an AE will be d ocumented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 Designated study staff  will record all reportable event s with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the site-investigator or study site staff will inquire about the 
occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information unt il 
resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.8.[ADDRESS_1184133] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention  
caused the event. Study outcome s that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be 
reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study intervention  and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the 
investigator must immediate ly report the event to the sponsor . 
 All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site -investigator deems the event to be 
chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by 
[CONTACT_36909] ( DCC)/study sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 The study sponsor  will be responsible for notifying the FDA of any unexpected fatal or lif e-threatening 
suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the sponsor must notify FDA and all participating 
investigators in an Investigation al New Drug ( IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical 
trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting . 
 
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_1184134] (ESI) must be reported within 24 hours of identification. Adverse events of 
special interes t in this study include:  
• Food impaction.  
• Anaphylactic reactions or acute allergic reactions that require immediate  treatment. 
• Severe injection site reaction s that last longer than 24 hours . 
• Any severe infection, any bacterial infection requiring treatment with  parenteral antibiotics or 
treatment with oral antibiotics for longer than 2 weeks, any clinical endoparasitosis, any 
opportunistic infection, a ny viral  infection requiring antiviral treatment . 
Note: Generally, all uncommon, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], peculiar, or unusually persistent  infections, especially viral 
infections, should be reported as ESI.

investigator to report the event to the lead site within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth,  or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the trial. If a subject becomes pregnant, they will also be withdrawn from the study.  
 All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to  the Lead Site.
 
 
8.9 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.9.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participant s or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“ Possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_183290] . Reasonable possibility means that the event is more likely 
than not related to participation in the research or, in other words, there is a >50% likelihood that the event is related to the research procedures. ); and  
• Suggest s that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
31  
8.9.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated  problems ( UPs) to the reviewing IRB and t o the DCC /study 
sponsor . The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, investigator’s  name, and the IRB 
project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC /study sponsor within 24 hours  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor  within 24 hours  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for 
Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) within the timeline specified per policy of the IRB’s receipt 
of the report of th e problem from the investigator.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Primary Efficacy Outcome (s): Mean change in dysphagia from baseline to 3-months post -treatment (as 
measured by [CONTACT_851641] 7 -day recall). 
 Hypothesis:  Patients treated with mepolizumab will have lower EEsAI scores after 3- months of therapy 
compared to patients treated with placebo.  Given the rapid mechanism of action of mepolizumab 
related to decreasing eosinophil counts, as well as recent clinical trial literature showing that dysphagia 
symptoms in EoE improve in a few as 8 weeks with both steroids and biologics, we feel that a 12 week course of mepolizumab is sufficient to demonstrate a symptom response.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Outcome (s): Esophageal eosino phil counts in adults and adolescents with active 
eosinophilic esophagitis after a 3-month  treatment course.  
 
Hypothesis:  Patients treated with mepolizumab will have lower esophageal eosinophil counts and higher 
rates of histologic response (defined with thresholds below 15 eosinophils per high- power field) 
compared to patients treated with placebo.

Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
32 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
The study is powered for the primary outcome , the EEsAI score, which can range from 0 -100, with a 
score of ≤ 20 indicating clinical remission, and a decrease of ≥ [ADDRESS_1184137] the clinically meaningful difference of 20 (see Table).  
Assuming a 20% dropout rate, we plan to randomize 36 patients in each group.

For the secondary outcome of proportion of patients with an EEsAI score ≤ [ADDRESS_1184138] as little as a 40% difference in remission rates between placebo and active therapy with a power of 0.9, a smaller difference that was detected in a recent trial using this metric.
48 This sample size would also provide ample power the for 
the absolute eosinophil count and EREFS secondary outcomes.  
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
The analysis dataset will be modified intention to treat  (ITT), which will include all participants who 
received study drug and who have 3- month outcome data for EEsAI and endoscopy.  We will have a 
secondary analysis dataset for a sensitivity analysis where the last available EEsAI value will be carried forward for any participants who terminate the study or are lost to follow -up. 
 The safety analysis dataset will be all participants who received study drug, regardless of follow -up time 
or other outcomes.

normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges will be presented rather than means, and non -
parametric testing will be used.  For inferential tests, a p value < 0.05 will be considered significant and 
all tests will be two tailed.  All statistical estimates (e.g., medians, proportions, incidence rates, mean 
differences, correlations, etc.) will be tabulated along with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs).

treatment failure, then assigning them to treatment success and comparing the results,  a technique that 
has been successful in prior clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_27156] . For all outcomes, the null hypothesis 
is that there is no difference between the study groups.  All hypothesis tests that are observed to be NOT 
statistically significant will be reported as being inconclusive . 
 
The s tudy stat istician on this study will be Jo seph  Galanko.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES(S)  
The primary outcome  will be the mean change in dysphagia as measured by [CONTACT_851619] ( 7-day 
recall) from baseline to 3-months post -treatment.  Patients will complete this measure at screening 
(baseline), and then every month  throughout the study when they come for their medication injection.  
This study will consider baseline at the point when symptoms are assessed prior to the study drug  being 
given.   
We are focusing on symptoms as the primary outcome as this is the key clinical metric for a PRO -
measured treatment response.41 The EEsAI is a validated and responsive PRO, developed by [CONTACT_851642], that measures dysphagia frequ ency, dysphagia severity, and food 
avoidance/modification behaviors, in patients with EoE.42, 45-[ADDRESS_1184141], 59 subjects were randomized to receive an or dispersible  budesonide tablet and 29 to 
placebo.51 A total of 30 patients (59%) in the active arm achieved an EEsAI score of ≤ [ADDRESS_1184142] 
2 patients (7%) in the placebo arm (p < 0.0001).  In the second study, which was a study of the anti -IL-4α 
receptor blocker dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], EEsAI was measured in a subset of patients had EEsAI .49 The 17 patients 
who received active treatment had a 36% decrease in the EEsAI score compared to an 11% decrease in the 13 patients who received placeb o (p = 0.085).  These new data support the use of the EEsAI as a 
primary outcome . The EEsAI score can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicated more severe 
symptoms; a decrease of 20 points is felt to be a meaningful clinical response, and scores ≤ [ADDRESS_1184143] -treatment (as 
measured by [CONTACT_851643] 7- day recall) will be compared between the mepolizumab and placebo 
groups using analysis of covariance.  In discussion with the study statistician, the main factor that we will 
include in the primary analysis is the baseline EEsAI score, though in the exploratory analyses we will assess trial site . We will also include the stratification factor (prior steroid response as a covariate as 
appropriate in the analyses (see below as well).  
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES (S) 
Secondary outcomes  are as follows:  
• The proportion of patients who have clinical remission as defined by [CONTACT_851644] ≤ 20. This 
will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_60679] -square.  
Mepolizumab for EoE  Version  6.0 
Protocol #: 18-0431  21May2021 
 
34 • The proportion of patient who have a clinical response, as defined by [CONTACT_851645] 
≥ 20 points.  This will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_60679] -square.  
• The absolute peak eosinophil count (measured in eos/hpf) after 3-months of treatment.  
Eosinophil counts will be measured by [CONTACT_851646], with central reading of all biopsy samples at the lead site to ensure a consistent reading approach.
[ADDRESS_1184144].  
• Levels of histologic response after 3- months of treatment including < 15, ≤ 6, and ≤ 1 eos/hpf.  
This will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_60679] -square.  
• Mean change in severity of endoscopic findings as measured by [CONTACT_851647] (EREFS) from baseline to 3- months post -treatment.  EREFS is a validated and responsive 
endoscopic severity score that assesses the five mo st common endoscopic features of EoE:  
exudates, rings, edema, furrows, and strictures.50, 51 This will compared between the groups 
using analysis of covariance . 
• Mean change in the Straumann Dysphagia Instrument (SDI) from baseline to 3-months post -
treatm ent. The SDI is a direct measure of dysphagia frequency and severity with a [ADDRESS_1184145] Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  
terminology.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1184146] ( DSMB ) will 
review all SAEs as soon as they are reported, and all AEs at the pre -set meeting intervals.  If two grade [ADDRESS_1184147] additional aim (“to determine predictors of symptomatic and histologic 
response to mepolizumab treatment, including potential biomarkers”), we will perform prespecified 
planned analyses of the primary or secondary outcome s by [CONTACT_654],  sex, and race/ethnicity, depending on 
the final characteristics of the population enrolled in the study.  
 
9.4.8  TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT  DATA 
Data will be analyzed in the aggregate, so we are not planning any primary analyses which present individua l data by [CONTACT_265786].  Depending on the results and data distributions, however, this 
may be done in exploratory fashion.

9.4.9  EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
Prespecified e xploratory outcomes are as follows:  
• Mean change in peripheral blood eosinophil levels from baseline to 3-months post -treatment.  
This will be compared between the groups using analysis of covariance . 
• For patients initially randomized to active medication, the same set of outcomes (as listed 
above) will be assessed after 6 months  of treatment.  This will be compared between the groups 
using analysis of covariance . 
• For patients initially randomized to placebo, a paired analysis will be conducted to compare 
month 3 to month 6  outcomes.  This will use paired t -tests for continuous variables and 
McNemar’s test for categorical variables.  
• For the same set of outcomes  (as listed above) , 3-month data for patients initially randomized to 
active medication (300mg monthly) will be compared to [ADDRESS_1184148] completed 3-months of 100mg monthly.  This will provide 
a comparison of the 300mg to the 100mg dose . 
• Adverse events and safety during all time points in the study.  This will be compared between 
groups  by [CONTACT_60679] -square.  
 Additional Exploratory outcomes are as follows:  
• Change in weekly  SDI score over the course of the study, and correlation of SDI with the EEsAI 
score . We will also explore the minimal clinically important differences ( MCID s) of these 
measures. 
• Biomarkers, including serum and tissue levels of cytokines and related factors  (IL-5, IL-13, and 
eotaxin -3 [CCL26]) , and eosinophil granule levels ( i.e. eosinophil peroxidase or major basic 
protein) in blood and tissue.  
• Antibodies to mepolizumab as a measure of immunogenicity.  The study sponsor will assist with 
these measurements . 
• Additional histologic findings, including eosinophil degranulation, microabscesses, basal layer hyperplasia, spongiosis, and lamina propria fibrosis (in samples with adequate subepi[INVESTIGATOR_318866]).  
• Response outcomes (noted above) in prior steroid responders vs. non -responders.  Steroid non -
response is defined as g reater than 15 eos/hpf after a 2 -month course of a swallowed/topi[INVESTIGATOR_851609] a standard dose (standard dose =  2mg/d of budesonide or 1760 mcg/d of fluticasone) . 
Of note, the randomization is balanced for prior steroid response, but the study is not powered for this exploratory outcome. We will also explore the response outcomes in the context of all 
prior EoE treatments to understand heterogeneity of treatment response, if present, and will 
include this stratification factor as a covariate in the above analyses, as appropriate . 
• Response outcomes (as noted above) in patie nts on a restrictive diet vs. an inclusive diet.  A 
restrictive diet will be defined as any diet at baseline (which also mu st be maintained through 
the study) that is either limited in foods because of EoE or because of food 
allergies/intolerances.

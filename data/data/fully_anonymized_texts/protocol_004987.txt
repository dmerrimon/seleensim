Milk protein feeding after aerobic exercise in older adults with pre-diabetes taking the biguanide metformin
 
      Complete Sections 1 - 16. Specify N/A as appropriate. Do not leave any required sections blank.
1. Purpose of the study
a) Provide a brief lay summary of the project in <[ADDRESS_1010061]-exercise milk protein feeding will enhance the mitochondrial protein synthesis
(biogenesis) response to an exercise-training program. In addition, we propose that this stimulatory effect
of protein feeding will overcome the potential blunting effect of metformin on exercise responses. We will
investigate these outcomes over a 12-week exercise-training program in older adults with pre-diabetes
with or without metformin treatment.
Sub-study:
1. CGM in Individuals with prediabetes undergoing an exercise-training program with or without Metformin.
2. CGM in healthy control individuals to compare to individuals with prediabetes.
Page 8 of 33
  
b) What does the Investigator(s) hope to learn from the study?
We hope to:
a) provide the first evidence that post-exercise milk protein supplementation is effective in diseased
population (i.e., older adults with pre-diabetes) and those on medications (i.e., metformin).
b) demonstrate that the potential inhibitory effects of metformin on aerobic exercise adaptations can be
opposed by [CONTACT_739063].
Sub-study
1. Glucose Profiles via CGM in pre diabetic individuals before, during and after the intervention (i.e.,
aerobic exercise training with or without metformin with post-exercise carbohydrate or
carbohydrate+protein feeding as listed below in 2a).
2: Glucose profiles via CGM in healthy individuals. Healthy individuals will complete baseline procedures
but will not complete an intervention.

Study Procedures (If this is a student project, the methods section of the thesis or dissertation proposal
must be attached in section #16 - Attachment section.)
 
a) In lay language, describe all the procedures, from screening through end-of-study, that the human subject
must undergo in the research project, including study visits, drug treatments, randomization and the
procedures that are part of standard of care.  Please note: Do NOT respond "See Attachment Section." If
you would like to add tables, charts, etc., attach those files in the Attachment section (#16).
Study Overview:
Pre-diabetic and healthy participants will first undergo a medical questionnaire, resting ECG, graded
exercise test with ECG and assessment of VO2max, anthropometric measurement (height, weight and
body composition by [CONTACT_364205]), an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and a muscle biopsy.
Prediabetic participants will be screened to eliminate those lactose intolerant, medications known to affect
the primary outcomes, medications or recent procedures contraindicated with metformin  or not pre-
diabetic. Subjects who meet these criteria will be randomized so that subject characteristics are matched
between groups, while the study team and participants will remain blinded to treatment (i.e., randomized,
double-blind study design). Subjects will be assigned to exercise + carbohydrate + placebo, exercise +
protein + placebo, exercise + carbohydrate + metformin, or exercise + protein + metformin.
A minimum of two days apart from the VO2max test, skeletal muscle will be sampled from pre-diabetic and
healthy participants. During these visits, pre-diabetic subjects will have the option to participate in a study
to test the impact of one counseling session on physical activity after completion of the exercise training
and to identify individual, socio-cultural and environmental determinants of physical activity [ADDRESS_1010062] the option to participate in a study to wear a Dexcom
generation 6 (G6) continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to measure glucose values every 5 minutes. Healthy
participants will wear the device once for up to 10 consecutive days. Pre-diabetic participants will wear the
device for up to 10-consecutive days at three different time points: before, during and after the 12-week
exercise intervention for a total of 30 days wearing the CGM. The Dexcom G6 CGM is for investigational
use only and is not FDA approved. The G6 is modeled after commercially available, FDA approved CGM
devices. The differences between the G6 and commercially available devices are a reduced calibration
scheme, meaning less finger stick blood glucose measurements for calibration;  a longer wear for up to [ADDRESS_1010063] completed this supplementation
protocol in previous studies and a currently ongoing investigation.
At the 8-wk time point, pre-diabetic subjects will begin the daily consumption of heavy water (D2O) for the
assessment of mitochondrial and individual protein synthesis. At the completion of the training period, the
pre-diabetic subjects will repeat all assessments performed prior to training including the DEXA, VO2max,
OGTT and muscle sample. Muscle samples obtained pre- and post-training will be used to evaluate
mitochondrial function using high-resolution respi[INVESTIGATOR_038], western blot analysis, and stable isotope
incorporation (post only).
Healthy participants will complete the medical history questionnaire, resting ECG, graded exercise testing
(ECG and VO2max), DEXA, OGTT, CGM, and muscle biopsy.
Detailed Procedures:
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): An OGTT is the most common clinical procedure to determine
impaired glucose tolerance and indices of insulin sensitivity. First, an intravenous catheter will placed in an
arm or hand vein to obtain blood samples for analysis of plasma glucose and glucoregulatory hormones.
Blood will be sampled before, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after completing the consumption of
75 gram glucose beverage. The fasted blood sample will also be used for a blood chemistry panel that
includes electrolytes, glucose, in addition to kidney and liver related variables (including creatinine, eGFRif
AFR AMER, eGFR, Albumin, Bilirubin, Alk Phos, AST, Uric Acid, ALT, A/G ratio, etc.).Subjects will not be
allowed to participate until a medical doctor has signed-off on the blood screening. A 6-week blood draw
will be taken to confirm that kidney and liver variables have not changed. Additional blood draws may be
obtained per physician discretion.
Body Composition: Height, weight will be recorded. Percent body-fat, fat-free mass, total and regional
adipose tissue mass, and total bone mineral density will be determined using whole-body dual energy x-
ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as we have previously used.
VO2Max: Subjects will undergo a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) examination at rest and during a
graded exercise test on a stationary bicycle until volitional fatigue, in order to determine maximal oxygen
uptake (VO2max). ECG measurements will be made continuously, and blood pressure and ratings of
perceived exertion will be recorded. These tests will be performed in the Human Performance/Clinical
Research Laboratory (HPCRL) following standard procedures.
Skeletal Muscle Biopsy: Skeletal muscle biopsies will be performed using well-established IRB approved
SOPs. The belly of the vastus lateralis will be anesthetized locally with 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. A
small incision (~4-mm in length) will be made and a Bergstrom needle inserted. Negative pressure will be
applied to the inner channel of the needle using a sterile 30-ml plastic syringe. Benjamin Miller, Ph.D.,
Adam Konopka, Ph.D., or Matthew Hickey Ph.D. will perform the skeletal muscle biopsies. Collectively, the
investigative team has performed this procedure on over 1,000 subjects. A muscle sample will be obtained
once before and after the 12-week exercise training (a total of 2 muscle biopsies).
Exercise Training: The exercise-training program will be performed within the facilities for the Noon Hour
Fitness Program at CSU according to our previously published procedures in older individuals. Exercise
will be performed on a treadmill, stationary bicycle, or elliptical and include warm-up (15 min at a heart rate
corresponding to 60% of max ) and workout stages (30 min, progression from 65 to 85% of max heart rate
by [CONTACT_739064] 5). The participants will wear heart rate monitors to ensure proper heart rate ranges and the speed,
grade or resistance of equipment will be changed to maintain heart rate at the specified percentage of max
HR. A CPR trained technician will supervise each exercise session to monitor adherence to the exercise
prescription and ensure subject safety. The drinks will be consumed immediately after exercise under
supervision.
Nutritional Intervention: Subjects will consume either a protein-carbohydrate or carbohydrate drink with a
consistency and temperature similar to a smoothie or milk shake immediately after each exercise bout.
The protein-carbohydrate drink will be greek yogurt+fruit (~300 kcal, 63g carbohydrate, 20g protein, 1g fat)
and the carbohydrate will be fruit (~300 kcal, 82g carbohydrate, 2g protein and 1g fat).
Metformin and Placebo: We use a titration dosing protocol in which the amount of metformin starts at 500
mg/day in week 1 and increases by 500 mg/day/week until reaching 2000 mg/day by [CONTACT_5875] 4. 2000 mg/day
is the standard clinical dose and used previously by [CONTACT_20685]. The titration dosing scheme
and taking metformin/placebo with meals will help reduce the most common side effects (i.e.,
gastrointestinal discomfort). If participants experience gastrointestinal discomfort, the dose will be lowered
to 1500 mg/day. If participants have a body weight of 75 kg or less the maximal dose will be 1500 mg/day
to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal discomfort.
Stable Isotope Labeling: The subjects will consume D2O (70%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover
Page 10 of 33
 MA, [LOCATION_003]) during the last four-week period of the 12 week intervention. D2O is a stable, non-radioactive
isotope that is indistinguishable from normal water,  A target of 1–2% enrichment is achieved during a one-
week priming stage (50 ml of D2O 3x/d = 150 ml/d) and maintained for three weeks (50 ml of D2O 2x/d =
100 ml/d) as we have previously performed.
Optional Continous Glucose Monitoring (CGM): CGM is a commonly used device to continuously measure
glucose values in healthy control and diabetic populations in both research and clinical applications. Only
trained members of the research team will place and remove the CGM devices following a standard
operating procedure and user guide.  The sensor pod will be secured to the skin of the abdomen using
medical grade adhesive. Once secure, a plunger will insert the sensor underneath the skin to record
interstitial glucose values every [ADDRESS_1010064] the timing and
amount of medications, physical activity, food and drink.
Optional Physical Activity Behavior Counseling: After completion of the 12-week exercise intervention,
participants will be randomized to 1) receive one session of physical activity behavior counseling (PABC),
or 2) no counselling control (CON).The counseling session will consist of strategies based on social-
cognitive theory hypothesized to increase physical activity adherence. Session activities will include 1)
discussion of the benefits of physical activity, 2) discussion of evidence based recommendations for
frequency, intensity, time and type of physical activity for reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and
associated co-morbidities, 3) setting individual physical activity goals, 4) identifying and discussing barriers
and facilitators for physical activity, and 5) identifying strategies to overcome barriers. The counseling
session will be completed in person while the follow-up questionnaires 12 weeks after completing the
exercise training can be done via phone or email.
Healthy participants will complete the medical history questionnaire, resting ECG, graded exercise testing
(ECG and VO2max), DEXA, OGTT, CGM, and muscle biopsy.
 
b) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project.
We are interested in improving human health using recommendations by [CONTACT_739065].
 
c) Alternative Procedures. If the proposed study is a clinical trial of a drug, vaccine, device or treatment,
describe alternative procedures, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. Describe the important
potential risks and benefits associated with the alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment. Any
standard treatment that is being withheld must be disclosed. This information must be included in the
consent form.
No alternative procedures
 
d) If the proposed study is a clinical trial of a drug, vaccine, device or treatment, will it be possible to continue
the more (most) appropriate therapy for the subject(s) after the conclusion of the study?
Clinical parameters obtained during the study will be available to the participants to share with their
primary physician. Then the subject and primary physician can decide on the most appropriate therapy for
the subject after the conclusion of the study.
 
e) Study Endpoint. If the proposed study is a clinical trial of a drug, vaccine, device or treatment, what are the
guidelines or end points by [CONTACT_152630]? If one
treatment proves to be clearly more effective than another (or others) will the study be terminated before
the projected total subject population has been enrolled? When will the study end if no important
differences are detected?
No alternative treatments
 
f) State if deception will be used. If so, provide a rationale and describe debriefing procedures. Submit a
Page 11 of 33
 debriefing script in the Attachment Section (#16).
No deception will be used.
 
3. Background
a) Describe past experimental and/or clinical findings leading to the formulation of the study, if applicable.
Physical activity and the biguanide drug Metformin have been shown independently to reduce the
incidence of T2D. Interestingly, these data also suggest in adults over the age of 60 metformin had
marginal efficacy while physical activity lowered incidence of T2D by 70%. Currently, governing agencies
recommend physical activity and metformin together for individuals with pre-diabetes of all ages to prevent
the progression to overt T2D. Until recently, the interaction between exercise and metformin has been
largely understudied. Members of our investigative team have previously showed that metformin does not
enhance but may blunt the glucoregulatory and cardiovascular response to acute and chronic exercise,
which is especially relevant to older adults. A purported mechanism of action is that metformin inhibits
mitochondrial respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], which likely limits VO2max and mitochondrial protein synthesis. We have
previously demonstrated that post-aerobic exercise dairy feeding can improve VO2max to a greater extent
than post-exercise carbohydrate beverage. Therefore, we feel dairy supplementation may override the
potential inhibition of metformin on exercise adaptations and maximize the benefits for older adults. To
date, real-time continuous glucose monitoring is limited in individuals at risk of T2D. Moreover, glucose
profiles via CGM during or in response to exercise, metformin and/or post-exercise nutrition have yet to be
fully characterized. Much clinical research is limited to measurements in the clinical research setting while
real-time glucose monitoring performed in both the standardized clinical research setting and in free-living
scenarios is novelty of the current study design that will close a gap in knowledge regarding
glucoregluatory effects of exercise, metformin and/or standardized post-exercise nutrition.

8.  
Subject Population - In the space below, please detail the participants that you are requesting to recruit
(include requested participant number and description of each group requested).  (Input N/A if not
applicable)
a) Requested Participant Description (Include number of participants that you plan to study and description of
each group requested, if applicable).
We plan to recruit 120 men and women with an estimation that 15-25% of participants will not qualify (i.e.,
screen out) and 15-25% of participants will not complete the study (i.e. drop out). We plan to complete the
study in 60 men and women aged >55 years who are prediabetic defined as impaired fasting glucose (100
to 126 mg/dl), HbA1c (5.7-6.4%), family history of type 2 diabetes, and/or impaired glucose tolerance
defined as 2 hour postprandial blood glucose of 140 to 200 mg/dl. Participants will be eligible if they meet
any [ADDRESS_1010065] normal glucose values (fasting glucose (<100mg/dl),
HbA1c (<5.7%), 2 hour postprandial blood glucose (<140mg/dl)) or no family history of type 2 diabetes will
be recruited.
Sub-study: 20 pre diabetic participants and 10 healthy individuals will complete the study.
Subpopulation of [xx] participants will be recruited for Physical Activity Behavior Counseling (previously
approved in Amendment 3.
 
b) What is the rationale for studying the requested group(s) of participants?
Page 14 of 33
 Individuals at risk for T2D are the intended population for metformin; CGM; and Counseling studies. We
will use a healthy control group to compare to individuals at risk for T2D.
 
c) If applicable, state the rationale for involvement of potentially vulnerable subjects to be entered into the
study, including minors, pregnant women, economically and educationally disadvantaged, or decisionally
impaired subjects. Specify the measures being taken to minimize the risks and the chance of harm to the
potentially vulnerable subjects.
We will not enroll minors, pregnant women, economically and educationally disadvantaged, or decisionally
impaired subjects.
 
d) If women, minorities, or minors are not included, a clear compelling rationale must be provided. Examples
for not including minors: disease does not occur in children; drug or device would interfere with normal
growth and development; etc.
Minors are not included because the cost-benefit ratio is not clear and therefore inappropriate for this
study.
 
e) State if any of the subjects are students, employees, or laboratory personnel. They should be presented
with the same written informed consent. If compensation is allowed, they should also receive it.
If any of the subjects are students, employees, or laboratory personnel they will be presented with the
same written informed consent and compensation.
 
f)  Describe how potential subjects will be identified for recruitment (e.g., chart review, referral from individual's
treating physician, those individuals answering an ad). How will potential participants learn about the
research and how will they be recruited (e.g., flyer, email, web posting, telephone, etc.)? Attach recruitment
materials in the Attachment Section (#16). Important to remember: potential subjects may not be contact[CONTACT_152633].
Potential subjects will be recruited initially from the Colorado State and Fort Collins community via email,
electronic, newspaper, radio, or bulletin advertisements. Colorado State employees, local physicians and
interested participants may be emailed for recruitment and communication purposes. Physicians will be
contact[CONTACT_739067] (i.e., physical activity and metformin). Text for advertisements will be
obtained from the attached flyer. Information for local physicians is also attached.
 
g)  If applicable, provide rationale for the inclusion of healthy volunteers in this study. Specify any risks to
which these healthy volunteers may possibly be exposed. Specify the measures being taken to minimize
the risks and the chance of harm to these volunteers.
We will include healthy volunteers to compare to individuals at risk for T2D. No additional risks are known
for healthy individuals compared to those at risk for T2D. Healthy individuals will not perform the
intervention.

9. Risks (Input N/A if not applicable)
     
US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Regulations define a subject at risk as follows: "...any
individual who may be exposed to the possibility of injury, including physical, psychological, or social injury,
as a consequence of participation as a subject in any research, development, or related activity which
departs from the application of those accepted methods necessary to meet his needs, or which increases
the ordinary risks of daily life, including the recognized risks inherent in a chosen occupation or field of
service."
 
 a)  PI's evaluation of the overall level of Risk. (Please check one: minimal or > minimal.)
Minimal (everyday living)
Y > Minimal (greater than everyday living)
 
 b)   
For the following categories include a scientific estimate of the frequency, severity, and reversibility of
potential risks. Wherever possible, include statistical incidence of complications and the mortality rate of
proposed procedures. Where there has been insufficient time to accumulate significant data ON risk, a
statement to this effect should be included. (In describing these risks in the consent form to the subject, it is
helpful to use comparisons which are meaningful to persons unfamiliar with medical terminology.) Address
any risks related to:
 
 
        1.    Use of investigational devices. Please include the clinical adverse events (AEs) associated with
each of the devices with an indication of frequency, severity and reversibility. This information
can often be found in the Investigator(s) brochure.
Dexcom CGM G6 is not an FDA approved device. This is currently available for research and
investigational purposes. Please see IB in attachments and notes in protocol notes. Wearing of
device should not be placed through baggage x-ray machine or body scanner. Rarely, the
sensor wire may break or detach from the sensor pod. These do not pose a significant medical
risk, but participants should contact [CONTACT_739068] 24 hours if experiencing a
broken wire. Risks include infection, bleeding, pain or skin irritations (e.g., redness, swelling,
bruising, itching, scarring or skin discoloration) from the sensor and wearing the adhesive
patch.
 
 
        2    Use of investigational drugs. Please include the clinical AEs associated with each of the drugs
with an indication of frequency, severity and reversibility. This information can often be found in
the Investigator(s) brochure.

        4    When performing procedures, please include all investigational, non-investigational and non-
invasive procedures (e.g., surgery, blood draws, treadmill tests).
Catheter Placement for OGTT (beginning and end of study): Minor discomfort of having the
Page 18 of 33
 needle inserted and taped to an arm. In about 1 in 10 cases, a small amount of bleeding will
occur under the skin that will cause a bruise. The risk of forming a blood clot in the vein is about
1 in 100, and the risk of significant blood loss is 1 in 1,000. This procedure is currently CSU-IRB
approved and active.
Muscle biopsy (beginning and end of study): The risk of allergic reaction to lidocaine and
lidocaine toxicity is extremely low (0 in the ~1500 cases witnessed by [CONTACT_976]). There is a small risk
of infection at the site of incision. There is a small risk of the incision reopening/bleeding after
the subject leaves the lab. All subjects will have a small scar at the incision site. The rate and
degree of healing varies considerably, but it is expected that scars will be difficult to see within
6-12 months after the procedure.
Consumption of Heavy Water: Brief periods (< 30 minutes) of dizziness have been reported in a
small number of people (< 5%) after drinking special water. This is due to the special water
being heavier than normal water. Heavier water can temporarily disrupt your inner ear ability to
control balance, producing a sensation of dizziness.
Exercise and Exercise Testing (VO2max): There is a very small chance of an irregular
heartbeat during exercise (< 1% of all subjects).  Other rare risks of a stress test are heart
attack (< 5 in 10,000) and death (<2 in 10,000).  Wearing a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_438847]-clip during
the graded exercise test can sometimes cause dryness in the mouth and mild discomfort.
CGM: The insertion of the CGM is a very quick procedure that causes no more discomfort than
the blood sampling or finger prick. The sensor sits beneath the skin and the participant should
not feel the senor once it is inserted. There is a small risk of infection, bleeding, pain or skin
irritations (e.g., redness, swelling, bruising, itching, scarring or skin discoloration) after inserting
the CGM sensor and wearing the adhesive patch. To minimize the risk of discomfort,
researchers will clean the area of skin with sterile alcohol swabs. The sensors and applicator
are shipped in sterile packaging and will be inserted within [ADDRESS_1010073] been studied in 241 subjects across 9 independent clinical study
sessions. There were 5 total adverse events reported in these studies that included reddening,
irritation, infection and shooting pain at the site of the insertion or adhesive site that resolved
within 24 hours. No serious adverse device effects or unanticipated adverse device effects
were reported. A detailed report can be found in the investigational brochure in Section 4
Existing Clinical Data.
Fingersticks: Participants will likely experience brief (<30s) physical discomfort during the finger
stick procedure when the lancet goes into your finger. In about 10% of the cases a small
amount of bleeding under the skin will produce a bruise. A small scare may persist for several
weeks. The risk of local infection is less than 1 in 1,000 and is minimized by [CONTACT_739069]
(70% ethanol) swabs provided.
 
 
        5   Radioisotopes/radiation-producing machines(e.g., X-rays, CT scans, fluoroscopy).
Body Composition by [CONTACT_364205] -
A small amount of radiation exposure (0.05 mRem) associated with the DEXA that is less than
1/[ADDRESS_1010074] x-ray. No immediate short-term or long-term risk to adults from this
radiation dose. This procedure is currently CSU-IRB approved and active.

 d)  In case of overseas research, or working with a specific race/ethnicity in the [LOCATION_002], provide
background on what experience the Investigator(s) have with the proposed population. Describe
qualifications/preparations that enable the Investigator(s) to evaluate cultural appropriateness and
estimate/minimize risks to subjects.
N/A
 
 e)  Special Precautions. Describe the planned procedures for protecting against or minimizing potential risks. If
appropriate, include the standards for termination of the participation of the individual subject. Discuss
plans for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse effects to the
subjects.
The potential risks of the proposed studies will be minimized by: a) using only safe, well-established
procedures; b) constant, personal monitoring of each experimental session by [CONTACT_739070]; and c) the availability of emergency equipment and medicine. Students and other
subordinate personnel on the research team will undergo the required human subjects training and will be
very carefully monitored in their technique and interactions with subjects.
Venous catheter risks
Venous catheters will only be placed by [CONTACT_190036].
Muscle Biopsy
The skin will be disinfected with Betadine and all instruments will be sterilized to reduce the risk of
infection.
Exercise
Qualified personel will supervise your initial resting and exercise ECG to determine if you are healthy
enough to perform regular exercise. During the exercise intervention a CPR trained exercise physiologist
will supervise every exercise session.
CGM
CGM will only be placed and removed by [CONTACT_739071]. The
skin will be disinfected using sterile alcohol swabs.
 
 f) 
Data Safety Monitoring                                                                                          
     N Is there a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)?
 
 
            If yes, describe its role and indicate who set up the Data Safety Monitoring Board (e.g., sponsor
or Protocol Director).
 
 
            Describe the data and safety monitoring plan developed to ensure the safety of participants and
the validity and integrity of research data. Monitoring should be commensurate with risks and
with the size and complexity of the trials.

Statistical Plan  
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and a significance 
was set a priori at P<0.05. Normality was confirmed by [CONTACT_941] D ’Agost ino and Pearson 
test. A two -way ANOVA (Treatment Group x Time) with repeated measures  for time 
was performed. Upon a significant effect, a Holm -Sidak ’s post -hoc test was used for 
multiple comparisons.  When comparing the change ( ∆) from pre to post -intervention 
between groups, data were analyzed using an unpaired t -test. Pearson’ s correlation 
coeffi cient (r) was used to determine associations between dependent variables. 
GraphPad Prism 7.0 was used to perform statistical analysis

encouraged to complete the procedures for the end-of-treatment visit (Week 12) within approximately 
2 weeks (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or 4 weeks (for Cohort 4) from last dose of study drug, as well as 
visits thereafter through Week 24.  
Number of Subjects (Planned): 
Cohorts 1–2: approximately 16 subjects
Cohort 3: approximately 75 subjects
Cohort 4: approximately 40 subjects
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
Subjects 18 to 80 years of age, body weight  140 kg
and fulfills the 2010 ACR/European Union League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification 
criteria for RA.

 efficacy analysis, a 2-sided type 1 error rate of 0.05will be used if applicable . Details about all 
statistical analyses will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
Sample size estimation: 
The sample size for Cohorts [ADDRESS_870295]-404 being 1.2 points better than placebo (improvement for placebo = 1.[ADDRESS_870296] 
deviation = 1.3). If 21 subjects in each of the 3 treatment arms (KPL-404 5 mg/kg qwk, KPL404 5 
mg/kg q2wk, and placebo) complete 12 weeks of DAS28-CRP assessments, the study provides 83% 
power for the treatment comparison with 2-sided 0.05 type 1 error. In order to account for an 
anticipated discontinuation rate of 16%, approximately 25 subjects per arm (a total of approximately 75 
subjects) are required to enroll in Cohort [ADDRESS_870297]-404 being 1.3 points better than placebo (improvement for placebo = 1.[ADDRESS_870298] deviation = 1.3). Enrollment of [ADDRESS_870299]-404 arm and 14 subjects into the 
placebo arm (i.e., 3:2 randomization ratio) allows 80% power for the treatment comparison with 2-
sided 0.05 type 1 error if all subjects complete 12 weeks of DAS28-CRP assessments. In order to 
account for an anticipated discontinuation rate of 10%, approximately 24 subjects (KPL-404) and 16 
subjects (placebo) for a total of approximately 40 subjects are required to enroll under Cohort 4.     
Analyses of efficacy: 
For Cohorts 1 and 2, only descriptive statistics and listings will be produced for all efficacy parameters. 
No formal statistical testing for efficacy will be performed.  
For Cohorts 3 and 4, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used to compare the change 
from baseline in DAS28-CRP at Week [ADDRESS_870300]-404 dose groups and placebo will be compared using Cochran-
Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by [CONTACT_245632] . In addition, logistic regression models 
may be produced including key baseline characteristics as covariates in addition to treatment. 
Interim analysis: 
An interim analysis may be conducted to support internal decision-making, for example, when at least 
50% of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_870301] completed the 12-week treatment period. The Cohort 3 interim 
analysis may include cumulative safety, tolerability, PK, , clinical response (e.g., DAS28-CRP), 
and . Selected Kiniksa personnel will be unblinded to the interim analysis. The data 
from the interim analysis will not be communicated to blinded study team personnel at the clinical 
research organization, investigational sites, or enrolled subjects until all subjects have completed the 
study and database lock has been achieved. Details of the individuals who will see group-level 
unblinded data will be provided in the Unblinding Plan. Further details regarding the interim analysis 
will be provided in the SAP.

 4. INTRODUCTION
4.1. Background
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. The 
hallmark of RA is an inflammatory process manifested by [CONTACT_649368], which can ultimately lead to bone erosions, deformity, and disability (McInnes et 
al, 2011). Left untreated, or inadequately treated, progressive functional impairment with 
increasing disability occurs, leading to decreased ability to perform activities of daily living 
resulting in a reduction in quality of life. The prevalence of RA in the general population is 
approximately 1% and increases with age in both sexes, with women being more prone to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_176356]. Standard-of-care treatment includes early therapy with 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARDs), including conventional synthetic DMARDs 
(csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and leflunomide). In the 
last 2 decades, targeted biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) have revolutionized the treatment 
paradigm for RA, in which therapy is optimized until clinical remission or at minimum low 
disease activity is achieved. The bDMARDs have greatly improved the clinical, functional, and 
radiographic outcomes for patients with RA (Smolen et al, 2017) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a wide therapeutic 
armamentarium of bDMARDs, a blockade of any single cytokine or cellular subset has not 
shown control of disease in all RA patients. In randomized controlled studies and clinical 
practice, approximately 30% to 40% of treated patients show inadequate response to bDMARDs, 
fail to maintain good response over time, or experience adverse events (AEs) leading to 
treatment withdrawal (Favalli et al, 2016) . These patients with inadequate response or 
intolerance to one or more bDMARDs, in many of whom multiple csDMARDs have previously 
failed, have few treatment options, and treatment of the disease in this population remains a 
crucial unmet need in the management of RA.  
Studies have shown that patients refractory to specific bDMARDs might benefit from therapy 
with a different mechanism of action (Emery et al., 2008; Genovese et al, 2018) . A recent study 
indicates that a switch in mechanism of action (from a Janus kinase inhibitor [JAKi] to a tumor 
necrosis factor inhibitor, or vice versa) in non-responders and incomplete responders leads to 
improvements in disease activity 3 to 6 months after randomization to study medication, with 
minimal risk of flare and without an increase in clinically meaningful adverse events 
(Fleischmann et al, 2020 ).  
The CD40-CD40L costimulatory pathway is implicated in various autoimmune diseases. 
Numerous CD40-CD40L-mediated inflammatory reactions, such as induction of 
proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory activity of dendritic cells and 
monocytes/macrophages, are known to be important in the pathogenesis of RA ( Berner et 
al, 2000). The pathway is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of RA by [CONTACT_649369], resulting in profound inflammation. However, the role of the pathway in 
RA has yet to be fully elucidated (Guo et al, 2017) .
Results in clinical studies have not yet confirmed the role of CD40/CD40L pathway inhibition in 
RA. Visvanathan, et al. (2019 )reported a Phase [ADDRESS_870315]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 19 
 of an IV injectable CD40L (CD154 antagonist, (Albulescu, et al, 2018)  reported decreased 
disease activity with at least low level of disease activity in 50% to 70% of patients. 
Additional information is available in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
4.2. Study Rationale
The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of KPL-[ADDRESS_870316] been 
assessed in a single ascending-dose study in healthy subjects (KPL-404-C101). The clinical 
development plan is designed to focus next on assessing safety, tolerability, PK(primary 
objective), and efficacy (secondary objective) of KPL-404 with multiple-dose administration, 
initially with two ascending-dose cohorts: Cohort 1 (2 mg/kg dose level vs. placebo), 
administered subcutaneously (SC) on alternate weeks (q2wk), and Cohort 2 (5 mg/kg dose level 
vs. placebo SC q2wk). Cohort 3 is designed to assess the comparative efficacy (primary 
objective)as well as the safety, tolerability, and PK (secondary objectives) of KPL-404 using the 
weight-based 5 mg/kg SC dose level administered either weekly or biweekly versus placebo over 
[ADDRESS_870317]-404 (400 mg) administered SC monthly versus placebo. Efficacy will be 
assessed using the primary endpoint, change from baseline in disease activity score of 28 joints 
using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) at 12 weeks.  
4.3. Dose Justification  
4.3.1. Cohorts 1 and 2 Dose Justification  
The Cohort 1 starting dose was selected based on the following factors. 
1. Pharmacodynamics: Analysis of receptor occupancy (RO) data from study 
KPL-404-C101 demonstrated full CD40 
across the evaluated dose levels. For IV doses (0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), full CD40 RO 
was maintained through Days 2, 9, 29, and 71, respectively. For SC doses (1 and 5 mg/kg 
SC), full CD40 RO was maintained through Days 9 and 43, respectively. Analysis of the 
T-cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) 
demonstrated that single IV doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg completely suppressed TDAR to 
primary KLH challenge through Days 9, 36, and 57 (last time point analyzed), 
respectively. Similarly, single SC doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg completely suppressed TDAR 
to primary KLH challenge through Days 9 and 29 (last time point analyzed), respectively, 
justifying a bi-weekly dosing frequency for all dose levels to be studied. 
2. Safety Profile: The safety profile of the single ascending-dose study in healthy subjects 
(KPL-404-C101): single doses up to 10 mg/kg IV and 5 mg/kg SC were assessed. There 
were no deaths or related serious adverse events (SAEs), the only serious event being a 
patellar fracture related to a fall. There were no AEs observed that would limit dosing.  
3. Pharmacokinetics: To evaluate optimal dosing regimens for Phase [ADDRESS_870318]-404-C101. This population PK model simulated PK 
profiles for dose levels of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg SC administered q2wk and for the dose 
level of 5 mg/kg SC administered every week (qwk) (Figure 1) .  
KPL-[ADDRESS_870319]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 20 The model assumed a target mean trough concentration (C trough
preliminary estimate for a minimum efficacious plasma concentration (C eff), consistent 
with the threshold established for similar assets in this class of anti-CD40 monoclonal 
antibody therapeutics ( Ulrich 2018, Fisher 2020 ). Results from the simulations suggested 
that steady state concentrations would be achieved at/after approximately [ADDRESS_870320]-404 2.5 mg/kg q2wk had a mean maximum serum 
concentration (C max) and an area under the serum concentration-time curve from time [ADDRESS_870321] dosing interval (AUC 0-
, respectively, at steady 
state. The mean accumulation ratio was approximately 3-fold following multiple dose 
administration and appeared to be consistent across all the dose range tested.  
4. Safety Margin: KPL-404 was evaluated in 8-week and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. The only adverse findings in the studies werean early 
termination on Day 143 of one female at 97 mg/kg SC after exhibiting clinical signs of 
poor health for several days, and another female administered 97 mg/kg SC that exhibited 
bilateral uveitis associated with a small blood clot in the anterior chamber of the eye. The 
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 12-fold higher than the starting dose in 
this Phase 2 study, and the systemic exposure associated with the NOAEL by [CONTACT_649370] 10.6-fold higher. This provides an adequate safety margin 
between the proposed dose range for this study relative to the nonclinical safety findings.

4.3.2. Cohort [ADDRESS_870323] investigated dose level (5 mg/kg SC) from the 
ascending-dose investigation. Cohort 3 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_870324]-404 5 mg/kg SC q2wk, KPL-404 5 mg/kg SC qwk, or placebo SC qwk. While the 5 mg/kg 
SC qwk administration frequency will not have been directly investigated in Cohorts [ADDRESS_870325]-404-C101, demonstrated that expected 
exposures and C effaresimilar for 5 mg/mg SC qwk and 10 mg/kg SC q2wk (Figure 1) .  
4.3.3. Cohort 4 Dose Justification  
Cohort 4 subjects will be randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_870326]-404 SC 
q4wk (a 600 mg SC [or matching placebo] loading dose at the Baseline Visit followed by 
[CONTACT_66578] 400 mg SC [or matching placebo] at Week 4 and Week 8).  The objective 
is to explore the efficacy of KPL-404 at lower trough concentrations than Cohort 3, 
approximating the minimum level required for T-cell-dependent antibody response suppression, 
as seen in Phase 1.  This dosing regimen (i.e., a fixed-mg dose rather than weight-based dose) 
represents a different approach as compared to Cohort 3, and it does not represent a dose 
escalation. Rather, this fixed-mg (400 mg) administered dose provides a centered administered 
dose level, based upon early PK data showing a relatively neutral effect of weight on the PK of 
KPL-404, as would be expected given that monoclonal antibodies are large macromolecules with 
a volume of distribution restricted to the plasma.  The 400 mg administered dose is 5 mg/kg for 
an average [ADDRESS_870327].  The 600 mg loading dose is intended to facilitate reaching steady state 
trough levels more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], based on PK modeling. This regimen, based on the same modeling, is
expected to provide peak plasma concentrations no greater than those projected in Cohorts 2 and 
3 and trough plasma concentrations lower than the 5 mg/kg q2wk dose level in Cohort 2.

 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1. Overall Study Design
Figure 2 displays the overall schema for the study. A detailed outline of procedures and activities 
is provided in  Appendix 1.  
This is a 28-week (up to 4-week screening period, 12-week treatment period, and 12-week safety
follow-up period), multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose 
proof-of-concept study with PK lead-in designed to assess the safety, PK, efficacy, and PDof 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870329] one biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) or JAKi. 
The objectives of the study are to evaluate safety, efficacy, and PD of KPL-[ADDRESS_870330]-404. 
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), subjects will enter the screening period (Day –28 
to –1), before returning for the baseline visit and administration of the first dose (Day 1). 
Subjects can be rescreened only once, at the discretion of the Investigator and with approval 
from the medical monitor. Abnormal laboratory values may in certain cases be repeated with the 
approval of the medical monitor without the need for rescreening. If a subject is rescreened, a 
new subject number will be provided, and laboratory assessments can be repeated once where 
appropriate.  
All randomized subjects will receive a SC injection of the investigational product (IP) on Day [ADDRESS_870331] 2 cohorts, subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to escalating 
doses as follows:  
 Cohort 1: 2 mg/kg KPL-404 or placebo every 2 weeks (q2wk) (n = 8) 
 Cohort 2: 5 mg/kg KPL-404 or placebo q2wk (n = 8) 
Cohorts 1 and 2 will start sequentially, with each escalation approved by a Safety Review 
Committee (SRC), which will assess in an unblinded fashion the safety, and tolerability data 
after all subjects complete through Week 12 and PK through Week 8 (anticipated steady state) 
and applicable data are available. The composition of the SRC, meeting frequency, and 
procedures for review and decision-making will be described in detail in the SRC Charter. 
Following completion of Cohort 2, new subjects will enter Cohort 3. Subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive: 
 5 mg/kg SC every week (qwk) 
 5 mg/kg SC every 2 weeks (q2wk; weekly dosing with alternating administration of 
KPL 404 q2wk or placebo q2wk) 
 Placebo SC qwk 
To maintain the blind, all subjects will return to the study site weekly. One group (5 mg/kg SC 
qwk) will receive active investigational product every week at each visit. One group (Placebo SC 
qwk) will receive placebo every week at each visit. One group (5 mg/kg SC q2wk) will alternate 
between receiving active investigational product and placebo. 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870332]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 26 
 At approximately the end of Cohort 3 enrollment, the study will enroll subjects into Cohort 4. 
Subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive one of the following: 
KPL-404 SC q4wk (600 mg loading dose at baseline followed by [CONTACT_649364] 
400 mg q4wk at Weeks 4 and 8) 
Matched Placebo (equivalent volume) SC q4wk (loading dose at baseline followed by 
[CONTACT_649371] 4 and 8) 
In Cohorts [ADDRESS_870333] been completed. 
All subjects will return to the study site at all treatment and safety follow-up visits as per the 
Schedule of Activities (Appendix 1) for assessments of RA parameters as well as evaluations of 
safety, tolerability, PK, . 
If a subject discontinues treatment prematurely (i.e., before the end-of-treatment visit), the 
subject should be encouraged to complete the procedures for the end-of-treatment visit (Week 
12) within approximately 2 weeks (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or 4 weeks (for Cohort 4) from last 
dose of study drug, as well as visits thereafter through the Week [ADDRESS_870334] for an additional 12 weeks until the EOS visit (Week 24). An 
adverse event that occurs prior to study treatment administration should be recorded in the eCRF 
only if it is an SAE or is an AE related to a study procedure. All AEs/SAEs that occur after the 
first administration of study treatment through the EOS visit, whether or not they are related to 
the study, must be recorded in the eCRF. For subjects who terminate study participation early 
(i.e., before the Week 24 visit), the Investigator will report any SAEs that are reported to the 
Investigator within 30-day post-last dose administration.
KPL-[ADDRESS_870335]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870336]’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be 
the first consideration in making such a determination. For further details on blinding, refer to 
Section 8.5.The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded.  
6.4. Safety Review Committee  
The SRC will consist of expert clinicians, pharmacologists, and/or statisticians. Any individual 
who has any affiliation with Kiniksa will be “firewalled” such that they take no part in 
operational activities and have no project-related communication with the study team. The SRC 
will review cumulative safety and PK data.  
After all subjects in Cohorts [ADDRESS_870337] may be discontinued from treatment due to any Grade 3 (severe) or any Grade 4 (life-
threatening) TEAE, regardless of causality.  
For the study, enrollment in a cohort will be paused for review under any of the circumstances 
below: 
 Two subjects develop the same Grade [ADDRESS_870338] has a Grade 4 (life-threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) TEAE

to Follow-Up Criteria  
Subjects are free to discontinue study treatment or withdraw consent from the study at any time, 
without prejudice to their medical care.  
Treatment Discontinuation 
Subjects will be discontinued from study treatment if any of the following criteria are met. 
 Change in compliance with any inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant and 
affects subject safety as determined by [CONTACT_649375]/objectives, as considered applicable by [CONTACT_649376] (IMP) 
 Severe infection (severe AE or SAE) or opportunistic infections (regardless of 
severity/seriousness) 
 Any clinically relevant sign or symptom, including a RA flare requiring prohibited study 
medications(s), that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_649354]. 
Upon decision to discontinue treatment, the Sponsor should be notified immediately. If a subject 
is prematurely discontinued from IP (study treatment), he or she should complete the end of 
treatment (EOT) visit (Week 12) within approximately 2 weeks (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or 
4 weeks (for Cohort 4) from last dose of study drug, as well as visits thereafter through Week 24, 
as per the Schedule of Activities, for all safety and efficacy assessments. The Investigator may 
also request that the subject return for additional visits. 
Withdrawal of Consent 
Subjects are free to withdraw consent from the study at any time, without prejudice to their 
medical care. Only study subjects who withdraw consent will be considered discontinued from 
the study (as differentiated from treatment discontinuation).
If a subject is discontinued from the study (withdraws consent), the Sponsor will be notified, and 
the date and reasons for the study discontinuation / withdrawal of consent will be documented in 
the subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
KPL-[ADDRESS_870355]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870356] to follow-up will be covered in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
In the event of an unscheduled visit, only the relevant assessments/activities pertaining to the 
visit need to be performed and entered. All discontinued subjects will be followed until 
resolution of all their AEs or until the EOS visit.  
KPL-[ADDRESS_870357]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 37 
 8.2. Concomitant and Rescue Medications
Medication restrictions applicable during the treatment period are described in Section  7.2 
(exclusion criteria). Prior medication will be recorded up to [ADDRESS_870358] other than the study drug, is considered 
concomitant medication from Baseline (Day 1) to EOS.  
During the treatment period up to Day 85 (EOT), the dose of background csDMARDs and 
corticosteroids or a new additional csDMARD may not be increased. If a subject develops RA 
flares requiring increased doses and/or new RA medications (as rescue medication), the subject 
must discontinue IMP after informing the medical monitor. 
If a subject is discontinued from IP (study treatment), he or she should complete the EOT visit 
and remaining scheduled study visits through Week 24, per the Schedule of Activities, for all 
safety and efficacy assessments. The Investigator may also request that the subject return for 
additional visits.
After Day 85 (EOT), the dose of background csDMARDs and corticosteroids may be adjusted or 
a new additional csDMARD may be added to an existing one (except for combining MTX and 
leflunomide) if this is clinically indicated to improve disease management, in consultation with 
the medical monitor.
8.2.1. COVID Vaccines
Subjects are required to have completed a COVID-[ADDRESS_870359] agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception from the screening visit until 30 days after EOS visit. 
Highly effective methods of contraception include: 
 hormonal contraceptives associated with inhibition of ovulation (stable dose for at 
least [ADDRESS_870360] dose) 
 intrauterine device 
 intrauterine system 
 bilateral tubal occlusion 
 vasectomized male partner 
 abstinence from heterosexual intercourse 
Sexually active male subjects must have documented vasectomy or must agree to use a condom 
or highly effective method of contraception, as defined above, with their partners of childbearing 
potential from first dose until [ADDRESS_870361]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870362] operating procedures defined by [CONTACT_16015]: 
 Doses will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator or authorized 
designee.  
 Study drug accountability will be performed at the study site.  
8.4. Randomization  
All subjects who are eligible for study participation will be randomized on Day [ADDRESS_870363]-404 or placebo as per the 
randomization schedule prepared before the study by [CONTACT_16015]. Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_649366]  1 versus 
 2 classes of advanced targeted therapy (bDMARD or tsDMARD; e.g., TNF inhibitors, IL-6 
receptor inhibitors, T-cell costimulatory inhibitors, anti-CD-20 antibodies, JAK inhibitors). 
For Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will be randomized 3:1, KPL-404 to placebo. 
The overall randomization ratio in Cohort 3 is 1:1:1 (5 mg/kg q2wk, 5 mg/kg qwk, placebo). To 
maintain blinding, the placebo volume will be matched to the corresponding 5 mg/kg volume, 
and all subjects will be required to attend weekly visits through the treatment period.  
The overall randomization ratio in Cohort 4 is 3:[ADDRESS_870364]-404 (600 mg loading dose at baseline 
followed by [CONTACT_649364] 400 mg q4wk at Week 4 and Week 8) to matched placebo 
(equivalent volume; SC q4wk; loading dose at baseline followed by [CONTACT_649377] 4 
and Week 8).
An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will issue a unique randomization code to 
each subject, which will assign the treatment to the subject. The study drug will be assigned, 
prepared, and administered according to instructions in the Pharmacy Manual. 
8.5. Blinding
This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Investigators, the subjects, and remaining 
clinical site staff will be blinded to treatment throughout the course of the study.  The Sponsor 
will also be blinded to subject treatment assignment while each cohort’s enrollment and subject 
follow-up is ongoing. Specified Sponsor representatives (and designees) may be unblinded to 
subject treatment assignment in completed cohorts (i.e., all participants in the cohort having 
completed study participation [Week 24/EOS]), and this unblinding will be documented in the 
Unblinding Plan.  
The unblinded treatment assignment for each individual subject may be made available to the 
Investigator through the IRT system only in the event of a medical emergency or an adverse 
reaction that necessitates identification of the study drug for the medical management or welfare 
of that subject. Except in a medical emergency, the Investigator and blinded clinical site staff 
will remain blinded during the conduct of the study. The process and requirements for 
unblinding will be detailed in an Unblinding Plan. The date and reason for breaking the study 
blind should be documented.

Additional details for study drug receipt, handling, and disposal can be found in the Pharmacy 
Manual. 
10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Should it become necessary (e.g., due to COVID-19), at any point following randomization, 
home health nursing, telemedicine services, or other operational adjustments may be applied to 
in-person visits and dosing, in compliance with local requirements/regulations.  Where permitted 
by [CONTACT_5277]/regulations, study drug administration by a qualified healthcare provider in 
the home setting requires written approval from the Sponsor for each subject and cannot be 
performed prior to Week 2 (i.e., after 2 completed study drug administrations at the clinical site). 
10.1. Order of Assessments  
The following assessments should be conducted in the order below, as required, at a pre-dose 
and post-dose time points. Assessments not listed below can be done in any order:  
1. Patient-reported outcomes and clinician assessments  
2. Vital signs 
3. Blood sampling for safety, PK, efficacy, and assessments
4. Study drug administration (if applicable) must follow all other assessments 
5. Observational period: subjects will be observed for [ADDRESS_870366] year prior to the screening visit should be recorded. 
All documented prior advanced targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (bDMARD or tsDMARD; e.g., TNF 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870367]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 41 
 inhibitors, IL-6 receptor inhibitors, T-cell costimulatory inhibitors, anti-CD-20 antibodies, JAK 
ihibitors) for RA should be recorded along with response.  
A COVID vaccine regimen consistent with local guidance must have been completed at least [ADDRESS_870368] in a quiet setting without 
distractions (e.g., television, mobile phones) and will include body temperature, systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate per the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1) . 
Vital signs may also be measured at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_649378] a more detailed assessment of 
vital signs is required. All measurements will be performed singly and may be repeated if outside 
the relevant clinical reference range. Additional vital sign assessments may be performed if 
clinically indicated, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. 
10.2.5. Weight and Height  
Height and weight will be measured and recorded per Schedule of Assessments in  Appendix 1.  
Weight collected at Baseline will be used to calculate dose through all applicable dosing visits.  
10.2.6. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be completed per Schedule of Assessments in  Appendix 1.  
Complete exams exclude genitourinary/pelvic systems unless clinically indicated. An 
abbreviated physical examination may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator at any 
time during the study.  
10.2.7. Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed as per standard of care (e.g., after subject has been 
resting in supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 5 minutes). The ECG must include the following measurements: 
heart rate, QRS, QT, QTc, and PR intervals. The ECG at screening will not be required if a 
subject had a previously documented normal ECG within [ADDRESS_870369] X-ray, 2 views (posterior-anterior and lateral or oblique view), will be performed as part 
of a general baseline screen for underlying pulmonary disease. The chest x-ray will not be 
required if a subject had a previously documented normal chest x-ray within 120 days of 
screening. 
10.3. Efficacy Assessments  
10.3.1. Tender joint Count/Swollen Joint Count
The 68 joints will be examined and assessed as tender or not tender for Tender Joint Count (TJC) 
and 66 joints will be examined and assessed as swollen or not swollen for Swollen Joint Count 
(SJC) (Felson et al 1993; Smolen et al 1995 ). The 68 joints ([ADDRESS_870370]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol

 The urine drug screen will include opi[INVESTIGATOR_649355]. 
10.6. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
10.6.1. Definition of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not caused by [CONTACT_649379] (investigational) 
product. 
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they fulfill at least one of the 
following criteria:
 They induce clinical signs or symptoms 
 They are considered clinically significant
 They require therapy 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values, which are considered non-typi[INVESTIGATOR_649356].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Drug Reaction
An adverse drug reaction is defined as, “A response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended [DIR 2001/83/EC Art 1(11)]. Response in this context means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility” (see 
Annex IV, International Conference for Harmonisation [ICH]-E2A Guideline). 
Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the IB. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AE of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the investigational product and requires close monitoring and communication 
by [CONTACT_649380] [ADDRESS_870371]. AESIs for the purposes of this study are as follows: thrombosis, serious 
infection, serious and non-serious bacterial infections, eye disorders, and 
anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions. Anaphylaxis is defined below in  Table 2 using 
Sampson’s criteria (Sampson 2006).  
KPL-[ADDRESS_870372]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 45 
 Table 2: Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:
1.Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: 
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient  (minutes 
to several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient  (minutes to several hours): 
a.
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline 
PEF, peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]; BP, blood pressure. 
 of age, less than 
(70 mm Hg 1  [2  age]) from 1 to 10 years or age, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years of age. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase after the ICF is signed (ie, screening, 
baseline, treatment, washout, or follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, 
comparator, or placebo, that fulfills 1 or more of the following: 
Results in death
 It is immediately life-threatening
Life-threatening in the context of an SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (refer to the ICH-
E2D Guidelines) 
 It requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed 
consent 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870373]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870374] or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such 
events should be considered as “medically significant.” Examples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649357].  
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met. 
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered 
a serious adverse reaction. 
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious AE 
irrespective of whether a clinical event has occurred. 
10.7. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE. The causal relationship between an AE and the study drug 
will be defined as below:
 Not related: when the AE is definitely caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, or the 
study procedure/conditions 
 Unlikely related: when the temporal association between the AE and the drug is such 
that the drug is not likely to have any reasonable association with the AE  
 Possibly related: when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time 
of drug administration but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or 
the study procedures/conditions 
 Definitely related: when the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the drug, abates upon discontinuation of the drug, follows a known 
or hypothesized cause-effect relationship, and (if appropriate) reappears when the 
drug is reintroduced 
If the relationship between the SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possibly” or “definitely” related, the event will be considered related to the investigational 
product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. If the relationship between the 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870375]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870376] is deemed to be “unlikely related,” the case is considered 
not expedited in the [LOCATION_003] or European Union. 
10.8. Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: 
Mild = Grade 1: easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does 
not require intervention 
Moderate = Grade 2: causes some interference with daily activities; minimal, local, or 
non-invasive intervention indicated  
 Severe = Grade 3: medically significant event; prevents daily activity and requires 
medical intervention; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649358] = Grade 4: urgent intervention indicated; ER visit or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649359] = Grade 5
As appropriate, clinical judgment should be used to determine the severity of adverse events with 
further reference to the FDA Guidance for Industry: National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). The guidance document should not 
supersede Investigator judgment, as adverse events should be evaluated in the context of the 
clinical situation. 
10.9. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
need to be reported as Aes. Abnormal values that constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation of 
administration of study drug must be reported and recorded as an AE.  
Adverse event collection will begin after the signing of the ICF. An adverse event that occurs 
prior to study treatment administration should be recorded in the eCRF only if it is an SAE or is 
an AE related to a study procedure. All Aes/SAEs that occur after the first administration of 
study treatment through the EOS visit, whether or not they are related to the study, must be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
For subjects who terminate study participation early (i.e., before the Week 24 visit), the 
Investigator will report any SAEs that are reported to the Investigator within 30-day post-last 
dose administration. 
Every reasonable effort will be made to follow subjects who have Aes/SAEs. Any subject who 
has an ongoing AE will be followed until resolution or the EOS visit.  
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, 
the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), 
intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused 
the subject to discontinue the study. 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870377]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870378] 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study. 
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should 
also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be 
handled as Aes. 
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_737], or which meets SAE criteria, or any other event 
or condition regardless of grade, which in their judgment represents a reportable event, must be 
reported to the medical monitor and the Sponsor as soon as the Investigator becomes aware of 
the event. 
10.10. Reporting Adverse Events  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, occurring after the subject has 
provided informed consent and until the last study visit, must be reported to the Sponsor or 
designee, within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Additionally, Investigator reporting of 
SAEs to IRB/EC and other regulatory health authorities may be required per local rules and 
regulations. The following contact [CONTACT_649381]: 
US 24 Hour Safety Hotline:
  
Europe / Middle East / Africa (EMEA)/Asia Pacific 24 Hour Safety Hotline: 
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be sent to the above-mentioned 
Pharmacovigilance contact [CONTACT_649382]. 
The event must also be recorded on the clinical database. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed by [CONTACT_649383][INVESTIGATOR_73932], consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested as 
applicable and if available. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB as reference safety information (RSI) and is 
thought to be related to the study treatment, then the event is considered a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R), and Kiniksa or designee may need to issue an Investigator 
notification to inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that 
KPL-[ADDRESS_870379]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870380] timelines for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting as per ICH E2A will be 
followed.  
The Sponsor or designee will report all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the applicable regulatory authorities no later 
than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of this information. Fatal or life-
threatening unexpected experiences for which there is a possibility that the experience may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_649384] 7 calendar days after receipt of this 
information.  
Any SAEs experienced after completion of the study should only be reported to the 
Sponsor/Investigator. 
11. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
Statistics to be reported are outlined in this section. Analysis plans will be written and approved 
prior to performing the first interim analysis. All statistical analysis and reporting will be done 
using SAS 9.[ADDRESS_870381]-404 being 1.2 points better than placebo (improvement for placebo = 
1.[ADDRESS_870382] deviation = 1.3). Enrollment of 21 subjects in each of the 3 treatment arms 
(KPL-404 5 mg/kg qwk, KPL404 5 mg/kg q2k, and placebo) allows 83% power for the 
treatment comparison with 2-sided 0.05 type 1 error if all subjects complete 12 weeks of DAS28-
CRP assessments. In order to account for an anticipated discontinuation rate of 16%, up to [ADDRESS_870383]-404 being 1.3 points better than placebo (improvement 
for placebo = 1.[ADDRESS_870384] deviation = 1.3). Enrollment of [ADDRESS_870385]-404 
arm and 14 subjects into the placebo arm (i.e., 3:2 randomization ratio) allows 80% power for 
the treatment comparison with 2-sided 0.05 type 1 error if all subjects complete 12 weeks of 
DAS28-CRP assessments. In order to account for an anticipated discontinuation rate of 10%, 
approximately 24 subjects (KPL-404) and 16 subjects (placebo) for a total of approximately [ADDRESS_870386] 50% of subjects in Cohort [ADDRESS_870387] completed the 12-week treatment period. The Cohort 3 
interim analysis may include cumulative safety, tolerability, PK,  clinical response (e.g., 
DAS28-CRP), and . Should the Sponsor decide to conduct the Cohort [ADDRESS_870388]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol 
Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page 50 
 Interim Analysis, the Sponsor will provide the specifics of the interim analysis in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to such analysis as well as the list of unblinded individuals prior to 
unblinding of study data.  The data from the interim analysis will not be communicated to 
blinded study team, personnel at the clinical research organization, investigational sites, or 
enrolled subjects until all subjects have completed the study and database lock has been 
achieved. Details of the individuals who will see group-level unblinded data will be provided in 
the Unblinding Plan.  The SAP will be submitted sufficiently far in advance of any unblinding of 
study data to allow regulators to formulate and communicate any necessary feedback regarding 
the SAP prior to data unblinding. 
11.3. Analysis Populations  
Analysis populations are defined as follows: 
 Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population : All randomized subjects who receive 
at least one dose of study drug and have at least one post-baseline assessment for 
primary efficacy endpoint will be included in the mITT population. Efficacy analyses 
will be based on the mITT population.  
 Safety population : All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study 
drug will be included in the safety population. Safety analyses will be based on the 
safety population.  
11.4. Analysis of Efficacy  
11.4.1. Efficacy Endpoints   
[IP_ADDRESS]. DAS28-CRP  
The primary endpoint for Cohorts  3 and 4 and a secondary endpoint for Cohorts 1–2 is change 
from baseline in DAS28-CRP at Week 12. The DAS28-CRP score is derived from the number of 
swollen joints (out of 28 assessed), number of tender joints (out of 28 assessed), CRP level, and 
PGA score.

Version 6.0: 28 Jun 2023 {Confidential} Page [ADDRESS_870390] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS
12.1. Study Monitoring
Before the investigational site can enter a subject into the study, a representative study monitor 
of Kiniksa or designee will assess the investigational study site to: 
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities
 Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or designee. This will be 
documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or designee will have regular contact [CONTACT_434133], for the following: 
 Provide information and support to the Investigator(s). 
 Confirm that facilities remain acceptable. 
 Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed. 
 Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
subject (eg, clinic charts). 
 Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor. 
 Confirm that Aes and SAEs have been properly documented and reported, that those 
SAEs have been forwarded to Kiniksa, and that SAEs meeting criteria for reporting 
have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC. 
Specific details will be outlined in the clinical monitoring plan.  
12.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor quality assurance unit, a regulatory authority, an IEC,
or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. 
The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all 
study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and 
data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator 
should contact [CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

 14. ETHICS  
14.1. Ethics Review
Before initiating a trial, the Investigator/Institution must obtain approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_649360] (IEC) for the trial protocol, written informed consent 
form, consent form updates, subject recruitment procedures, and any other written information to 
be provided to subjects.  
The protocol will be registered in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In 
addition, after study completion and finalization of the study report, the results of this trial will 
be submitted for publication and posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 
This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures, and the data to be collected on 
study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safety of subjects should be 
administered as deemed necessary on a case-by-case basis. Investigators will apply due diligence 
to avoid protocol deviations.  
The IRB/EC will be informed by [CONTACT_649385].  
Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC approval. Any administrative 
amendments to the protocol will be provided to IRBs/IECs according to IRB/IEC procedures.  
The IRB/IEC will be informed by [CONTACT_649386]/IEC reporting requirements. The Investigator will provide the IRB/IEC with 
progress reports per IRB/IEC procedures. 
14.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed, and reported in accordance 
with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local 
regulations US CFR 21, and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
14.3. Informed Consent  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing (witnessed, where required by 
[CONTACT_6617]) IRB/IEC-approved informed consent. 
If applicable, in cases where the subject’s representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according 
to local requirements), the subject must be informed about the study to the extent possible given 
his/her understanding. If the subject is capable, he/she must indicate agreement by [CONTACT_649387]. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (eg, all 
procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be 
documented in the subject source documents. 
Women of child-bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve 
unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that to 
participate, they must adhere to the contraception requirements specified in this protocol. 
A copy of the approved version of all consent forms will be kept by [CONTACT_737].

eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner. The 
Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate. 
After final database lock, the Investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_447239].
All data should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation, and verification. 
15.1. Inspection of Records
The Investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
subject’s file. The Investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_1560] (a signed copy is given to the subject). 
The Investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency with the data capture and/or data entry. Additional checks of the consistency of the 
source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. No 
information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed.

Synopsis
5.0 Study 
Objectives and 
Endpoints Primary and Secondary Objective and Endpoint were modified to include Cohort 4 alongside 
Cohort 3. The objectives and endpoints 
for the new Cohort 4 were 
prespecified. 
Synopsis 
6.1 Overall Study 
Design 
 At approximately the end of Cohort 3 enrollment, the study will enroll subjects into Cohort 4. 
Subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive one of the following:
• KPL-404 SC q4wk (600 mg loading dose at baseline followed by [CONTACT_649364] 400 mg 
q4wk at Weeks 4 and 8) 
• Matched Placebo (equivalent volume) SC q4wk (loading dose at baseline followed by 
[CONTACT_649365] 4 and 8)Text was added to describe 
Cohort [ADDRESS_870410] discontinues prematurely (i.e., before the end of treatment visit), the subject should be 
encouraged to complete the procedures for the end-of-treatment visit (Week 12) within approximately 
2 weeks (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or 4 weeks (for Cohort 4) from last dose of study drug  as well as 
visits thereafter through Week 24. 
Upon decision to discontinue treatment, the Sponsor should be notified immediately. If a subject is 
prematurely discontinued from IP (study treatment), he or she should complete the end of treatment 
(EOT) visit (Week 12) within approximately 2 weeks (for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or 4 weeks (for Cohort 
4) from last dose of study drug as well as visits thereafter through Week 24, as per the Schedule of 
Activities, for all safety and efficacy assessments. The Investigator may also request that the subject 
return for additional visits.These paragraphs were 
modified for clarity to describe 
when subjects should return for 
an end-of-treatment visit 
following premature 
discontinuation of treatment.

Synopsis
6.2 Number of 
Subjects Number of Subjects (Planned): 
• Cohort 4: approximately 40 subjects 
 
The study plans to enroll approximately 16 subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2, approximately 75 subjects in 
Cohort 3, and approximately 40 subjects in Cohort 4, across approximately 100 study sites.  Text was revised to describe 
the Cohort 4 sample size.
Synopsis Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Placebo administered weekly, every other week, or monthly by [CONTACT_10530].  Text was revised to describe 
the dose administration 
frequency being evaluated in 
this clinical trial.
Synopsis 
11.[ADDRESS_870412]-404 being 1.3 points better than placebo (improvement for placebo 
= 1.[ADDRESS_870413] deviation = 1.3). Enrollment of [ADDRESS_870414]-404 arm and 14 
subjects into the placebo arm (i.e., 3:2 randomization ratio) allows 80% power for the treatment 
comparison with 2-sided 0.05 type 1 error if all subjects complete 12 weeks of DAS28-CRP 
assessments. In order to account for an anticipated discontinuation rate of 10%, approximately 24 
subjects (KPL-404) and 16 subjects (placebo) for a total of approximately 40 subjects are required to 
enroll under Cohort 4. Text was revised to describe 
the Cohort 4 sample size.
4.2 Study Rationale The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of KPL-[ADDRESS_870415] been assessed in a 
single ascending-dose study in healthy subjects (KPL-404-C101). The clinical development plan is 
designed to focus next on assessing safety, tolerability, and PK (primary objective), and efficacy 
(secondary objective) of KPL-404 with multiple-dose administration , initially with two ascending-
dose cohorts: Cohort 1 (2 mg/kg dose level vs. placebo), administered subcutaneously (SC) on 
alternate weeks (q2wk), and Cohort 2 (5 mg/kg dose level vs. placebo SC q2wk). Cohort 3 is 
designed to assess the comparative efficacy (primary objective) as well as the safety, tolerability, and 
PK (secondary objectives) of KPL-404 using the weight-based 5 mg/kg SC dose level administered 
either weekly or biweekly versus placebo over [ADDRESS_870416]-404 (400 mg) administered 
SC monthly versus placebo. Efficacy will be assessed using the primary endpoint, change from 
baseline in disease activity score of 28 joints using C -reactive protein (DAS28 -CRP) at [ADDRESS_870417]-404-C211 Clinical Study Protocol

4.3 Dose 
JustificationSubheadings are added to clarify dose justifications for Cohorts 1 and 2, Cohort 3, and Cohort 4.
 
Cohort 4 subjects will be randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_870418]-404 SC q4wk 
(a 600mg SC [or matching placebo] loading dose at the Baseline Visit followed by [CONTACT_649388] 400mg SC [or matching placebo] at Week 4 and Week 8).  The objective is to explore the 
efficacy of KPL-404 at lower trough concentrations than Cohort 3, approximating the minimum level 
required for T-cell-dependent antibody response suppression, as seen in Phase 1.  This dosing 
regimen (i.e., a fixed-mg dose rather than weight-based dose) represents a different approach as 
compared to Cohort 3, and it does not represent a dose escalation. Rather, this fixed-mg (400 mg) 
administered dose provides a centered administered dose level, based upon early PK data showing a 
relatively neutral effect of weight on the PK of KPL-404, as would be expected given that 
monoclonal antibodies are large macromolecules with a volume of distribution restricted to the 
plasma.  The 400 mg administered dose is 5 mg/kg for an average [ADDRESS_870419].  The 600 mg loading 
dose is intended to facilitate reaching steady state trough levels more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], based on PK modeling. 
This regimen based on the same modeling is expected to provide peak levels no greater than those 
projected in Cohorts 2 and 3 and trough plasma concentrations lower than the 5 mg/kg q2wk dose 
level in Cohort 2.    Text was added to explain and 
justify the KPL-404 dose level, 
administration, and frequency 
of the Cohort 4 dosing.

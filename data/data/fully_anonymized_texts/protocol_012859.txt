Page 5of 49STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) details the statistical methodology to be used in analyzing 
trial data and outlines the statistical programming specifications, tables, figures, and listings for 
clinical trial RSV-MVA-002. It describes the variables and populations, anticipated data 
transformations and manipulations, and other details of the analyses not provided in the Clinical 
Trial Protocol (CTP). 
The analyses defined in the SAP will be followed completely. It may be necessary to define 
some additional explorative analyses, and/or additional analysis populations. If any unforeseen 
additional analysis is included in the clinical study report (CSR) it will be clearly flagged as an 
additional unplanned explorative analysis. 
The analyses described are based on the final clinical trial protocol RSV-MVA-002 Edition 2.0 
dated 27 Jan 2017. 
GENERAL DEFINITIONS 
Vaccinations 
For this trial a vaccination means an intramuscular administration of active MVA-BN-RSV 
vaccine or Tris-buffered saline (TBS). 
Placebo 
Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 
Dose 1 
Represents the nominal titer of 1 x 108 Infectious Unit (Inf.U) per 0.[ADDRESS_295557] (IMP) doses and schedules.  
Age groups: Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_243628]: ≥ 55 to < 70, and ≥ 70 years of 
age. A minimum of 20 subjects per treatment group in the age stratum ≥ 70 years is required. 
Subgroups 
The subgroup consists of 20 subjects per treatment group (a total of 100 subjects) who will have 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collection as well as an additional serum and nasal 
swab sample collection time point one week post each vaccination. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific version Date: [ADDRESS_295558] vaccination. Note that it is possible for Visit 1 (V1) to be performed, for example, on trial 
Day -1. 
Baseline 
Baseline refers to the last measurement before first vaccination of trial vaccine. This is either at 
Visit 1 or at Screening (SCR) Visit (or latest re-screening) as applicable. For example, if there 
are missing vital sign data at Visit 1, the SCR or latest re-screening data will be used to impute 
the missing vital sign data as the baseline measurement. Partial rescreen is possible for certain 
isolated entry criteria. In such case the last measurement before first vaccination of trial drug will 
be used as the baseline value. This means that a subject’s baseline date may differ across screen 
and rescreen records. This data will be summarized as Baseline data without a direct 
specification of which visit was used. However, in all other visits no imputation will be used and 
the actual visit used will be specified in tables or listings. 
Staggering visit (VS) 
A visit only required by [CONTACT_243629]. The staggering 
process will be performed at one clinical site only. 
Vaccination Period 
A vaccination period is defined as the period starting at a given vaccination and ending [ADDRESS_295559] receives another vaccination or discontinues the trial 
with the following hierarchy:  
If subject receives both vaccinations, the second vaccination represents the end of 
vaccination period 1. 
The end of vaccination period [ADDRESS_295560] discontinues earlier. In this case, the discontinuation date represents the end of 
vaccination period 2. 
If subject discontinues before second vaccination, the discontinuation date represents the 
end of vaccination period 1. 
As the intention is that all subjects will receive two vaccinations, two vaccination periods will be 
recorded per subject. The overall vaccination period starts from the beginning of period 1 and 
ends at the end of period 2. 
Screening Phase 
The Screening Phase is defined from the Screening Visit up to, but not including Visit 1. This 
includes any Re-screening Visits that are conducted. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific version Date: 31 -May-17
Page 7of 49Active Trial Phase 
The active trial phase is defined as the trial phase starting with and including Visit 1 and ending 
with and including EAP (End of active trial phase) (V3 + 28-35 days). 
End of Active Trial Phase (EAP) 
EAP is defined as the last visit of the active trial phase.
Follow-Up Trial Phase 
The Follow-Up trial phase is defined as the phase starting after EAP visit and includes the 
Follow-up visits (FU1 and FU2). 
Eligible Subjects 
A subject is eligible if the screening question “Is subject eligible and willing to continue?” is 
answered with “Yes” and there are no subsequent substantial protocol deviations that affect the 
eligibility of the subject at Visit [ADDRESS_295561] is considered as having received both doses of trial vaccination per the randomized 
group assignment if a date of drug administration is given for the vaccination at Visit 1 and for 
the vaccination at Visit 3, and no major vaccine preparation or administration deviation is 
recorded. 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) 
An Adverse Event (AE) with onset either on the day of a vaccination, but after the vaccination or 
within the 28 days following a vaccination. Note that serious AEs are also considered treatment-
emergent after 28 days (see below). 
Serious Adverse Events 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) from first vaccination to last follow-up visit are considered 
as treatment-emergent regardless of the day of onset. 
AEs related to respi[INVESTIGATOR_243616], 
including the FU Visits and are considered as treatment-emergent regardless of the day of onset. 
Adverse Drug Reaction 
An AE with either a ‘possible’, ‘probable’, ‘definite’ ‘unknown’ or ‘missing’ relationship to the 
vaccine (which means: “causally related”). 
Nominal Titer 
The MVA-BN-RSV (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_14250]) vaccine is formulated at a nominal titer of 
5 x 108 Inf.U per dose (0.5 mL). The actual titer will be determined in stability testing.

Geometric Mean Titer and Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units 
The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units (GMSFU) are 
calculated by [CONTACT_243630] 10 transformed titers, and Spot 
Forming Units, respectively.  
(Sero)Negative and (Sero)Positive Results 
For each immunogenicity assay a negative result is defined as a titer below the DL, while a 
positive result is a titer equal to or above the DL. 
Response 
For each immunogenicity assay, a response to the vaccine (applicable only for post baseline 
visits) is defined as either the appearance of a positive result for subjects with a negative result at 
baseline (Visit 1), or an increase by a factor of at least 2 compared to the Visit 1 for subjects with 
a positive result at Visit 1. Response status is applicable only for V1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4, EAP 
Visit, and FU1 and FU2 Visits and is not calculated for subjects with missing Visit 1 titer. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific version Date: [ADDRESS_295562] a positive 
response status out of the number of subjects with a non-missing response status (positive or 
negative) at that visit. 
Responder 
A subject is an ELISPOT Responder to the vaccine in a particular test agent (F pool, G(A) pool, 
G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV Virus) if the subject has a response for at least two post 
baseline visits (V1b to V 4) within the same test agent. The responder evaluation applies only to 
subjects with at least two post baseline results available. 
The responder rate for each test agent F pool, G(A) pool, G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV 
Virus) is the percentage of subjects who are responders to the relevant test agent out of the 
number of subjects with a non-missing responder status (positive or negative). 
Individual peak titer 
The individual peak titer is the maximum of titers recorded on V1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4, EAP 
Visit.
Fold Increase 
The fold increase is defined as a subject’s post-Baseline titer at Visit X, divided by [CONTACT_243631].

1.1 Trial Description 
This trial is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase II trial in ≥ 55 
year old adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA-BN-RSV 
vaccine. A total of 400 subjects will be recruited into five treatment groups in this trial (see Table 
2).

Total 400 
In general, subjects are stratified by [CONTACT_243628]: ≥ 55 to < 70 and ≥ 70 years. However, 
during the staggering phase performed by [CONTACT_243632] (sentinel cohort and safety cohort) 
only the younger age group is recruited. In order to have the best power to detect differences 
between the strata the aim is to achieve equally distributed recruitment across the age strata but 
at least 20 subjects per treatment group are required in the age stratum ≥ [ADDRESS_295565] into Group 4 (i.e. 1:1 subjects receiving Dose 1 
and Dose 2). Following a positive safety assessment for the subjects in the sentinel cohort, 
recruitment in the safety cohort starts. The safety cohort includes a total of 10 subjects, 5 subjects 
each into Groups 2 and 4 (i.e. 5:5 subjects receiving Dose 1 and Dose 2). Following a positive 
safety assessment for the subjects in the safety cohort, recruitment in all groups for the remaining 
subjects is opened. The open recruitment phase includes all treatment groups. The open 
recruitment phase randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_243633].

staggering phase only. The members of the SMT are the national coordinating investigator, 
principal investigator (of the staggering site) and the medical monitors (BN and CRO) of the 
clinical trial. The primary responsibility of the SMT is to review and evaluate the accumulated 
trial data for safety after each staggering step and to make the decision to proceed to the next 
staggering step.  
1.7 Safety Monitoring Committee 
The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) is an independent board that oversees the safety of 
subjects participating in the trial. The primary responsibilities of the SMC are to periodically 
review and evaluate the accumulated trial data for participant safety, trial conduct and progress, 
and make recommendations to BN and the Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_243619] 
(PI) concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the trial. A separate charter 
describes in detail relevant operational procedures, communication pathways  and roles and 
responsibilities of the SMC. 
If an event occurs which fulfills the trial halting rules, the SMC will review the event in a timely 
manner and will give a recommendation to BN and the Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_243620], 
resume or terminate the trial participation of the affected subject and/or the trial as a whole.

Page 20of 493. Statistical Methods 
3.1. Planned Sample Size  
A group sample size of 70 per group (recruiting 80 per group to account for a 12% dropout rate), 
and an assumed SD of 0.46 for the log 10 PRNT titers (A strain) will give 80% power to detect a 
relative change in titers from the Group 1 of a 66% increase.  
Assumptions used to determine the sample size of the trial are below. 
Testing of the primary objective will be performed by [CONTACT_243642] 10 of the titers 
are normally distributed.  
No adjustment for multiple comparison is considered. 
Testing will be conducted in a descriptive manner and no adjustment for multiple testing 
will be performed. 
The upper 95% confidence limit of the standard deviation (SD) of the log 10 titers from the 
Phase I trial RSV-MVA-001 at Visit 6 ([ADDRESS_295573] second vaccination) was calculated as 0.46 (the SD was very similar in all groups). The SD is assumed to be similar to that 
observed in the RSV Phase I trial (RSV-MVA-001). 
3.2. Analysis Populations 
3.2.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
This is the subset of subjects who will have received at least one vaccination and for whom any 
post-baseline data are available. The primary analysis of safety and efficacy will be performed 
on this analysis set. 
In the case where a subject might receive the wrong randomized treatment, safety summaries for 
this subject will be based on actual treatment received. However, for a subject randomized to 
Group [ADDRESS_295574] will be based on their randomized treatment group. 
3.2.2 Per-Protocol Set (PPS) 
This is the subset of subjects in the FAS who have received all vaccinations, completed all visits 
of the active trial phase (Visit 1 to EAP) and adhered to all protocol conditions. Subjects with 
major protocol violations will not be included in this dataset. However, subjects with only minor 
(not relevant) protocol deviations are included into this dataset.  
The decision whether a protocol deviation is major or not for the classification of subjects into 
the various datasets will be made on a case-by-case basis at the data review meeting (DRM) prior 
to database lock. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 21of 49Potential major protocol violations are (but are not restricted to): 
1. Premature discontinuation of the trial during the active trial phase (the question “did the 
subject prematurely discontinue the trial?” is answered with “yes” even where no other 
reason exists to exclude the subject from further participation in accordance with the 
protocol). 
2. Subject did not meet all of the inclusion criteria. 
3. Subject met one or more of the exclusion criteria. 
4. Withdrawal from the second vaccination. 5. Major vaccine preparation and administration deviation from specification as given in the 
protocol including cases where the subject fulfils at least one of the criteria specified in 
the protocol for withdrawal from vaccination. 
6. Major deviations of the visit window as determined during the DRM(s). 
7. Prohibited Prior or Concomitant Medication use. 
8. Missing immunogenicity data at any critical visits (the decision on what is a critical visit 
will be made at the DRM). 
9. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_243621] A or RSV B. 
The main analysis of humoral and mucosal immunogenicity endpoints will be performed on the 
FAS. The same statistical procedures will also be applied to the PPS. If there is no substantial 
difference in FAS and PPS then only the FAS will be presented in the main part of the CSR. 
3.2.3 Immunogenicity Analysis Set (IAS) 
This is the subset of subjects in the FAS which was assigned to the PBMC subgroup. The main 
analysis of the cellular immunogenicity endpoints will be performed on the IAS. Additional 
subgroups may need to be defined during the DRM before database lock and would be described 
in the CSR. 
3.3. Data Definitions, Data Conventions and Handling of Missing Data 
3.3.1 Missing Immunogenicity Data 
Analysis of immunogenicity variables will be done on a valid case basis, i.e. for missing 
observations no imputation technique such as “Last observation carried forward” will be applied, 
since this could introduce an optimistic bias into the analysis. 
For assay results that are below the detection limit, refer to Table 1 : Detection Limits (DL) in the 
general definition section.

Page 22of 493.3.2 Missing Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Data 
In the case of incomplete AE and/or medication start and end dates, the following rules will be 
used to assign AEs to the correct vaccination period, and medications as prior/concomitant: 
For analysis purposes of any Prior and Concomitant Medication or any AE, imputation of partial 
start and end dates will be performed based on the following rules: 
† It is assumed that a missing month implies a missing day as well, and that a missing year implies a missing month and day. 
Partial/Missing Start Date 
If day is missing, then impute the 1st of the month as in the table above, but if the month 
is the same as the month of the first vaccination date then assign the imputed start date as the first vaccination date. 
If month and day are missing, then impute as above to January [ADDRESS_295575] vaccination 
date. 
If the date is completely missing, then impute the first vaccination date unless the end date indicates that the AE/medication could have started/been taken prior to this in which 
case the date is imputed to 1st January of the same year as the start date. 
Partial/Missing End Date 
If day is missing, then impute the last day of the month as in the table above unless the 
month is the same as the month of the first vaccination date then impute the end date as 
the last vaccination date. 
If month and day are missing, then impute as above to December [ADDRESS_295576] vaccination 
date. 
If the date is completely missing, check if AE/medication is ongoing before imputing a 
date and when the AE/medication started in relation to vaccination date. If the ongoing 
flag is missing, then assume that the AE/medication is still ongoing/medication is still 
being taken. In this case, do not impute the date. If the AE/medication stopped and the 
start date is prior to the first vaccination date, then impute the first vaccination date. If the 
AE/medication started on or after first vaccination date, then impute an end date which is 
one day after the last vaccination date. 
These imputation methods will be used for the table summaries. However, all listings will display the original dates as captured in the eCRF. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 23of 493.3.3 Assignment of AEs to Vaccination Period  
Each AE will be assigned to a vaccination period using date/time of vaccination and date/time of 
onset of the AE: 
All AEs starting at or after the first vaccination but before vaccination 2 (Visit 3) will be assigned to vaccination period 1.  
All AEs starting on or after the second vaccination but before or at EAP will be assigned 
to vaccination period 2. If the subject missed the second vaccination for any reason, the 
AEs will be assigned to the overall vaccination period. 
Any AEs starting after EAP up to the FU2 Visit belong to the FU period. 
If onset time is missing and start date of AE coincides with the date of a vaccination, the AE will be assigned to the vaccination period corresponding to the vaccination on this date. 
Each AE starting on or after first vaccination not matching the definition of a solicited AE is 
defined as an unsolicited AE. If a solicited AE begins outside of the 8-day period following the 
last vaccination it will be considered an unsolicited AE regardless of the preferred term (PT). If 
start time of the AE is missing and start date coincides with date of the vaccination, it will be 
regarded as a treatment-emergent AE. If the start date is (partially) missing the AE will be 
regarded as a treatment-emergent AE following the worst-case principle. 
Worst-case principle: 
To avoid a potential misclassification of an AE to a vaccination period or to the overall 
vaccination period, if an imputed start date corresponds to the first of the month or to the first of 
the year, and matches the month and year of the first or second vaccination date, then the AE will 
be assigned to the vaccination period with matching month and year. If the AE cannot be 
assigned to a vaccination period because of a (partially) missing start date then it will be only 
assigned to the overall vaccination period. 
3.3.4 General Considerations for AEs  
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.1 will be used for coding of 
AEs. 
Duration of an AE will be calculated as follows: 
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
End date – start date of AE + 1 day. Note that duration can be calculated even if time of 
day is missing for either start or end dates, or if time is missing for both. 
In case of partially missing start date (month and/or day missing) or partially missing end 
date (month and/or day missing), duration will not be calculated. 
In case of an ongoing AE, the duration will not be calculated. 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 24of 49For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
End date of AE – start date of AE + 1, where end date is the last day the symptom is 
defined as an AE and start date is the first day symptom is defined as an AE (no matter if 
the AE occurred at every day between first day and last day). In case of an ongoing AE, 
the duration will not be calculated. 
Relative day of onset between vaccination and start of AE will be calculated as follows: 
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
Start date of AE – corresponding vaccination date. 
In case of (partially) missing start date no calculation will be done. 
For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days] 
The relative day is calculated as the day of first symptom intensity recording > 0. 
Start date of AE – corresponding vaccination date, where start date is the first day a 
symptom is defined as an AE; vaccination day corresponds to Day 0.

3.5.7 Immunogenicity Analysis ELISA, PRNT and ELISPOT 
All serum and nasal swab immunogenicity results will be listed for the FAS. Tables will be 
prepared for the FAS and the PPS. Immunogenicity results from PBMC samples will be 
summarized for the IAS population. 
Primary immunogenicity endpoint: PRNT (A strain) titers 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint is Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) after one or two 
MVA-BN-RSV vaccinations or placebo measured by [CONTACT_243634] 
(PRNT; against strain A) [ADDRESS_295581] vaccination. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint will also be summarized descriptively using the 
geometric mean of fold increase, positivity rates (including associated 95% CI’s), and response 
rates (including associated 95% CI’s) for each treatment group, and by [CONTACT_243655]. 
In addition, the following descriptive comparison of the ratios of the GMTs and GMFI’s between 
treatment groups by [CONTACT_243656] 95% CI by [CONTACT_243657]10 PRNT (A strain) titers and log10 PRNT (A strain) Fold Increases are normally 
distributed: 
1. Group 2 / Group 1 – Two vaccinations compared to one vaccination using Dose 1 
2. Group 4 / Group 3 – Two vaccinations compared to one vaccination using Dose 2 
3. Group 3 / Group 1 – Dose 2 compared to Dose 1 using one vaccination 
4. Group 4 / Group 2 – Dose 2 compared to Dose 1 using two vaccinations  
5. Group 2 / Group 5 – Two vaccinations using Dose 1 compared to Placebo 
6. Group 4 / Group 5 – Two vaccinations using Dose 2 compared to Placebo 
As a secondary descriptive analysis for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, an ANOVA 
model (with dose and age group as independent variables) of the log 10 titers for the three doses 
Study specific version: 1.0
Study specific vers ion Date: 31 -May-17
Page 34of 49using Group 2, Group 4, and Group 5 will be performed. For Group 5 (2 vaccinations of 
Placebo), a dose value of [ADDRESS_295582] (i.e. slope) of the regression fit is significant at the standard 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_295583] in 
terms of responses for higher dose. This dose response ANOVA will be performed a second time 
without age group in the model.  
As an exploratory analysis, an ANOVA will be conducted on the log 10 titers using dose (2 
levels), the number of vaccinations (2 levels), and age group (2 levels) as main effects, and dose-
by-number of vaccinations as an interaction term. The main effect of dose (2 levels) will not 
include the placebo treatment group. To further explore whether baseline titers have an effect on 
dose, a similar ANOVA will be performed where the dependent variable of log 10 titers will be 
replaced with log 10 Fold Increase. 
All ANOVAs will be performed on the FAS only. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
All other immunogenicity results (PRNT strain B, ELISPOT, ELISA IgG/IgA) will be 
considered as secondary descriptive analyses and will be analyzed similarly to the primary 
endpoint analysis (by [CONTACT_243658]). Note that for 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, ANOVAs will be performed only for PRNT strain B, IgA 
ELISA and IgG ELISA Total. The dose-response ANOVAs will be performed without age group 
in the model. 
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs)
For all ELISA and PRNT results the GMTs will be calculated by [CONTACT_243659] 10 titer transformations.  
Descriptive statistics will be derived by [CONTACT_243660], Min, median, 
Max, GMT, with 95% CI (derived by [CONTACT_243661] 95% CI of the log 10 titer 
transformations based on the percentiles of the t-distribution).

Response rates 
Response rates for RSV-specific ELISA and PRNT titers will be presented by [CONTACT_243664]-Pearson 95% CIs. Response status is only 
applicable for subjects with a V1 (baseline) titer available. 
The same type of analysis of response rates will be conducted for the ELISPOT results and for 
IFN-γ and IL-4 results. 
Responder rates (ELISPOT) 
The responder rates (based on the total number of subjects with responder status available) will 
also be presented by [CONTACT_243665]-Pearson 95% CI.

[CONTACT_11196]. The incidence (i.e., the number of subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a specified solicited 
local AE on the day of vaccination or over the seven days after each vaccination divided by [CONTACT_243668]) will be calculated. The incidence will also 
be calculated for any solicited local AE for each vaccination period, the overall vaccination 
period, by [CONTACT_243669]. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher AEs will also be 
calculated as well as the incidence of Grade 3 or higher AEs. 
The duration (in days) of the solicited local AEs will be summarized and presented in a listing. A 
similar table and listing will be presented for relative day of onset for solicited local AEs.

Treatment-emergent unsolicited AEs in the active trial phase will be summarized by [CONTACT_86104] (SOC) and PT, and by [CONTACT_243670], and for overall. A similar table will be 
produced per subject. 
Separate tables for related treatment-emergent unsolicited AEs, graded ≥3 treatment-emergent 
unsolicited AEs, and related graded ≥3 treatment-emergent AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_243671].   
The total number events and percentages of all treatment-emergent unsolicited AEs will be 
presented by [CONTACT_2236], relationship, and for related AE intensity.

3.5.13 Physical Examination 
Subjects with abnormal physical examinations will be listed. 
3.6. Alterations in SAP from the Clinical Trial Protocol  
The following analysis items are deviations from the trial protocol: 
Section 7.1.1, RSV-specific ELISA, of the protocol states that “The GMT is calculated per 
visit as well as based on individual peak titers by [CONTACT_243673] 10 titer transformations. The Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) is calculated as (GMT at Visit 
X / GMT at Visit 1).” Per Bavarian Nordic instruction, this statistic will be deleted from the analysis, and replaced by [CONTACT_243674]. 
Section 9.2, Sample Size Calculation, of the protocol states that “A secondary descriptive 
quadratic orthogonal regression of the log
10 titers for the three doses using Group 2, Group 4 
and Group 5 will also be performed.” and “In addition, an explorative two way ANOVA will 
be conducted on the log 10 titers using dose (2 levels) and number of vaccinations (2 levels) 
fitting both main effects and the interaction term.” In both regression analyses, age group will 
be added to the model per direction from Bavarian Nordic.  
RSV-specific memory B cells analyses are not covered in this SAP, but will be addressed in 
detail in an SAP amendment after further assay development.

 General Definitions  
Booster Vaccinated /Treated  Subjects  
A subject is considered vaccinated or treated once they have received any dose of the booster  
vaccination.  
Booster Study Day  
For this sub -study, t he day of the booster vaccination is defined as Day 0, the following as  Day 1, 
and so on. Equally, the day before the booster vaccination in the screening period is defined as 
Day -1, and so on. A new study day begins always at midnight regardless of the time of the 
booster  vaccination.  
Booster Baseline  
If not otherwise specified, “ booster baseline”  refers to the last measurement prior to  the booster 
vaccination , which is performed on booster visit ( BV) 1 (approximately [ADDRESS_295597] 
vaccination in the main study) .  In case of missing vital event data at the first treatment visit, the 
booster screening  vital event  data may be used to impute baseline values . These  data will be 
summarized as baseline data without specif ying the visit from which the data were derived . 
However, in cases where no pre -treatment values exist for a baseline parameter, the subject will 
be considered as having no baseline, and post-baseline changes will not be able to be calculated  
and will be excluded from analyses . 
Main Baseline  
The main study baseline (described as “main baseline” in this document) refers to the last 
measurement before first vaccination with trial vaccine in the main study. This is either at Visit 1 
or at Screening Visit (or latest re -screening) as applicable.  
Booster Screening Phase  
Time period  from the booster screening  visit (BV0) until the booster vaccination visit  (BV1) .  
This could include any unschedule d visit s during the screening period up to the booster 
vaccination . 
Booster Active Trial Phase  (BATP)  
Time period covering from BV1 until the visit approximately 4 weeks later (Booster End of 
Active Phase ( BEAP )); whether this occurs at the final study visit or at an early termination visit ). 
This could include any unscheduled visits up until final visit of the booster active trial phase .  
This is also the vaccination period  of the booster sub -study .

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 8 of 43 
 Booster Follow -Up Trial Phase   
Time period between th e BEAP and the final study v isit.  Note that for subjects who do not return 
for booster sub -study follow -up visits ( BFU), there may be no BFU phase data available.  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  (TEAE)  
A TEAE is an adverse event with an onset either on or after the day of the booster vaccination , or 
within the 28 days following the booster  vaccination.   Note that serious AEs are also considered 
treatment -emergent after 28 days (see below).  
Serious Adverse Events  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) from BV1 to the last follow -up visit are considered as 
treatment -emergent , regardless of the day of onset.  
Related AE or Adverse Drug Reaction  (ADR)  
Treatment -related AEs are defined as TEAE s determined  by [CONTACT_243679] y, 
probabl y, or definite ly caused by [CONTACT_243680] -BN-RSV . TEAEs with an unknown or missing caus ality 
also constitute treatment -related AEs .  In case of missing causality assessments, a TEAE will be 
considered as related for the summaries.  
Nominal Titer  
The MVA -BN-RSV (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_243626] l Virus) vaccine is formulated at a nominal titer of 
5 x 108 Inf.U per dose (0.5 mL). The actual titer will be determined in stability testing.  
Geometric Mean Titer and Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units  
The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) and Geometric Mean Spo t Forming Units (GMSFU) are 
calculated by [CONTACT_243630] 10 transformed titers, and Spot 
Forming Units, respectively.  
Detection Limit (DL)  
The limit from where a positive signal can be measured in immunogenicity assays.   Refer to 
Appendix 6.1 for DLs of the planned tests.  
(Sero)Negative and (Sero)Positive Results  
For each immunogenicity assay , a negative result is defined as a titer below the DL, while a 
positive result is a titer equal to or above the DL.

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 9 of 43 
 Response  
For each immunogenicity assay, a response to the vaccine (applicable only for post baseline 
visits) is defined as either the appearance of a positive result for subjects wit h a negative result at 
baseline , or an increase by a factor of at least [ADDRESS_295598] baseline 
visits include Visit (V) 1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4, end o f active phase (EAP) visit, follow -up visit 
(FU) 1, and FU2 from the main study; BV1b, BV2, BEAP visit, BFU1 , BFU2  and BFU [ADDRESS_295599] agent (F pool, G(A) pool, 
G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV Virus) if the subject has a re sponse for at least two post 
baseline visits ( V1b, V2, V3, V3b, V4 from the main study; BV1b, BV2  from the booster sub -
study ) within the same test agent. The responder evaluation applies only to subjects with at least 
two post  baseline results available.  
The responder rate for each test agent F pool, G(A) pool, G(B) pool, N pool, M2 pool, RSV 
Virus) is the percentage of subjects who are responders to the relevant test agent out of the 
number of subjects with a non -missing responder status.  
Individual peak t iter 
The individual peak titer is the maximum of titers recorded on V1, V2, V3, V4, and EAP visit 
from the main study, BV2 and BEAP visit from the booster sub -study .  Since V1b, V3b, and 
BV1b samples are only collected for the PBMC subgroup, they will  be excluded from the peak 
titer selection.  
Fold Increase  
The fold increase is defined as a subject’s post  Baseline titer at Visit X, divided by [CONTACT_243631].   
Main study fold increase is defined based on the main baseline.  Booster sub -study f old in crease 
can be  defined based on the booster baseline or the main baseline .

 1 Introduction  
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) details the statistical methodology to be used in analyzing 
study data and outlines the key statistical programming specification s for the booster sub -study of 
clinical trial RSV -MVA -002.  It describes the variables and populations, anticipated data 
transformations and manipulations, and other details of the analyses not provided in the study 
protocol.  The SAP is written based on r ecommendations from ICH E3: Structure and Content of 
Clinical Study Reports , and ICH E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials .  Table, figure and 
listing shells are described in a separate document.  
The analyses described here are based on the final clinical trial protocol  RSV -MVA -002 Edition 
4.0 dated  April  26, 201 8.  Details for the analyses of the main study data are described in the final 
SAP dated May 31, 2017 and the SAP Addendum dated October 11, 2017.  This plan covers 
analysis details of data collected for the booster sub -study.  It will be followed completely for the 
analysis  of data derived from the sub -study .  If any unforeseen additional analyses are included in 
the clinical study report (CSR) they will be clearly described as additional, unplanned analyses.   
2 Trial Overview  
2.1 Trial Description  
This is a randomized, single -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging Phase II trial in ≥ 55 year 
old adults to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant MVA -BN-RSV vaccine. 
A total of 4 20 subjects were recruited into five treatment groups and were vaccinated in the main 
study (see Table 2 ).

treatment groups of the main study (Group 1 and Group 3) are planned to  be recruited to 
participate in the booster sub-study . They will receive a single booster vaccination  using the same 
MVA -BN-RSV dose they received during the main study.  Subjects will be followed up for 12 
months after their booster vaccination.   Out of these 86 subjects, approximately 26 will be 
recruited from the PBMC subgroup (approximately 13 subjects for each of the two selected dose

 groups ).  The selection of the treatment groups to be included in the booster sub -study is based on 
the results of the main study.  
2.[ADDRESS_295601] consented to participate in the booster sub -study will be enrolled until 
a total of 86 is reached .  PBMC sites will begin recruitment 1 -2 weeks prior to the remaining  sites 
to ensure 1 3 PBMC subjects  per treatment group .  Once 46 subjects are enrolled into one 
treatment group, enrolment for that group will stop to assure an approximately equal number of 
enrolled subjects in both treatment groups.  
2.2.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects in this booster sub -study will not be randomized.  They will get the same dose received 
during the main study.  
2.2.2 Blinding  
Subjects in the booster sub -study will not be blinded because they will get the same dose received 
in the main study , which has already been unblinded . 
2.3 Objectives  
2.3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the main study is  to assess the optimal dose and schedule of the 
MVA -BN-RSV vaccine in adult and elderly subjects in terms of immunogenicity.  
The objective of the booster sub -study is to demonstrate that the immune response of subjects 
previously vaccinated with MVA -BN-RSV vaccine can be boosted one year later with a single 
MVA -BN-RSV vaccination.  
2.3.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the main study are: 
• To assess safety and re actogenicity of the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine in adult/elderly subjects  
• To assess the RSV -specific humoral immune responses (in all subjects) and cellular immune 
responses (in a subgroup population of each group) against the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine in 
adult/elderly su bjects.  
• To explore a potential correlation of the RSV -specific immune response to RSV related 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_243618].

subjects of the selected treatment groups) one year after the last vaccination in the main trial 
in adult/elderly subjects.  
• To assess the RSV -specific humoral immune responses (in subjects of the selected treatment 
groups) and cellular immune respons es (in the respective subgroup population of the selected 
treatment groups) of the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine following a one year booster vaccination in 
adult/elderly subjects.  
• To identify further potential differences in durability and/or boostability  of immune responses 
in the two chosen MVA -BN-RSV dose regimens.  
• To assess safety and reactogenicity of the MVA -BN-RSV vaccine following the booster 
vaccination in adult/elderly subjects  
2.4 Study Population

Refer to the schedule of events in Appendix 6.2. 
4 Statistical Methods  
4.1 Planned Sample Size  
From two treatment groups selected based on immunogenicity/safety parame ters following 
primary vaccination, approximately 43 subjects will be recruited into the booster sub -study (86 
subjects in total).  Out of these 86 subjects, approximately 26 subjects (13 subjects for each dose 
group) will be recruited from the PBMC subgroup.  
Based on the variability observed in the log 10 titers for PRNT (A strain) [ADDRESS_295605] deviation (SD) is estimated to be 0.335 for the log 10 
titers 2 weeks after the booster vaccination . A total of 40 evaluable subjects per group will 
provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.213 (log10 -scale) at a significance level of 5% 
(two-sided), which corresponds to a ratio of 1.63 in GMTs.  Considering  a drop -out rate of 5% , 
[ADDRESS_295606] >80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the difference in 
immune response (log 10 titers)  after the initial vaccination and that after the booster vaccination is 
0.[ADDRESS_295607] deviation 
of the differences is 0.168  (log10 -scale) .  This comparison is also considered descrip tive.

Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 15 of 43 
 4.2 Analysis Populations  
Two analysis sets are defined for the booster sub -study.  
4.2.1 Booster Full Analysis  Set (BFAS)  
This is the subset of subjects who received a booster dose of MVA -BN-RSV vaccine and for 
whom any post -booster data are available . 
4.2.2 Booster Immunogenicity Analysis Set (BIAS)  
This is the subset of subjects in the BFAS who were from the PBMC subgroup.  
Additional analysis sets may need to be defined during the d ata review meeting and would be  
described in the clinical study report.  
4.3 Data Handling Conventions  
4.3.1 Missing Immunogenicity Data  
Analysis of immunogenicity variables will be done on a valid case basis, i.e. for missing 
observations , no imputation technique such as “l ast observation carried forward” will be applied, 
since this could in troduce an optimistic bias into the analysis.  
For assay results that are below the detection limit, refer to Appendix 6.1.  
4.3.2 Missing or Partial Dates in Adverse Eve nt and Concomitant Medication Data  
In the case of incomplete AE and/or medication start and end dates, the following rules will be 
used to assign AEs to the vaccination  period and medications as prior/concomitant:  
For analysis purposes of any Prior and Con comitant Medication or any AE, imputation of partial 
start and end dates will be performed based on the following rules:  
Missing  Rule for start date  Rule for end date  Flag for imputation  
Day First day of month  Last day of month  D 
Month† January 1  December 31  M 
Year† Vaccination date  Last BATP visit date  Y 
† It is assumed that a missing month implies a missing day as well, and that a missing year implies a missing month and day.  
 Partial/Missing Start Date  
• If day is missing, then impute the 1st of the month as in the table above, but if the month is 
the same as the month of the booster  vaccination date then assign the imputed start date as 
the vaccination date.  
MVA -BN-RSV  Final Version 1.0  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 16 of 43 
 • If month and day are missing, then impute as above to January 1 unless the year is th e 
same as for the vaccination date then assign imputed start date as the vaccination date.  
• If the date is completely missing, then impute the vaccination date unless the end date 
indicates that the AE/medication could have started/been taken prior to this in which case 
the date is imputed to January 1 of the same year as the start date.  
Partial/Missing End Date  
• If day is missing, then impute the last day of the month as in the table above unless the 
month is the same as the month of the last BATP visit date then impute the end date as the 
last BATP visit  date.  
• If month and day are missing, then impute as above to December [ADDRESS_295608] BATP visit  date.  
• If the date is comple tely missing, check if AE/medication is ongoing before imputing a 
date and when the AE/medication started in relation to vaccination date. If the ongoing 
flag is missing, then assume that the AE/medication is still ongoing/medication is still 
being taken. In this case, do not impute the date. If the AE/medication stopped and the 
start date is prior to the last BATP visit  date, then impute with the last BATP visit  date. If 
the AE/medication started on or after the last BATP visit  date, then impute an end dat e 
which is one day after the last BATP visit  date.  
These imputation methods will be used for assigning AEs to the vaccination period, and 
medications as prior/concomitant .  Listings will display the original dates as captured in the 
eCRF.  
4.3.3 Assignment of AEs  to Trial Phase   
Each AE will be assigned to the booster active trial phase  (BATP)  or booster follow -up (BFU) 
phase  using date/time of vaccination and date/time of onset of the AE:  
• All AEs starting at or after the booster  vaccination but before the BEAP visit will be 
assigned to the booster active trial phase.  For subjects who missed the BEAP visit, AEs 
within the booster vaccination + 28 day will also be assigned to the BATP .   
• Any AEs starting after the booster vaccination but are not assigned  to the BATP  belong to 
the BFU period.  
If onset time is missing and start date of AE coincides with the date of vaccination, the AE will 
be assigned to the BATP . 
Each AE starting on  or after the booster  vaccination not matching the definition of a solicite d AE 
is defined as an unsolicited AE. If a solicited AE begins outside of  the 8 -day period following the 
booster  vaccination it will be considered an unsolicited AE regardless  of the preferred term (PT). 
If start time of the AE is missing and start date co incides with date  of vaccination, it will be

Modified Vaccinia Ankara Vaccine  1-May-2018  RSV -MVA -002 Booster  
    
Bavarian Nordic  Restricted Business Proprietary  Page 17 of 43 
 regarded as a treatment -emergent AE. If the start date is (pa rtially) missing the AE will be 
regarded as a treatment -emergent AE following the worst -case principle.  
Worst -case principle:  
To avoid a potential mis classification of an AE to the BATP , if an imputed start date corresponds 
to the first of the month or to the first of the year, and matches the month and year of the booster  
vaccination date, then the AE will be assigned to the BATP . If the AE cannot be a ssigned to  
either phase because of a (partially) missing start date then it will be assigned to the BATP . 
4.3.4 General Considerations for AEs  
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 19.1 will be used for coding of  
AEs.  
Duration of an AE w ill be calculated as follows:  
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• End date – start date of AE + 1 day. Note that duration can be calculated even if time of 
day is missing for either start or end dates, or if time is missing for both.  
• In case of partially missing start date (month and/or day missing) or partially missing end 
date (month and/or day missing), duration will not be calculated.  
• In case of an ongoing AE, the duration will not be calculated.  
For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• End date of AE – start date of AE + 1, where end date is the last day  in which  the 
symptom is defined as an AE , and start date is the first day in which the symptom is 
defined as an AE ( disregarding if the AE occurred continuously between first and last 
day).  
• In case of an ongoing AE, the duration will not be calculated.  
Relative day of onset between vaccination and start of AE will be calculated as follows:  
For Unsolicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• Start date of AE – booster  vaccination date.  
• In case of (parti ally) missing start date no calculation will be done.  
For Solicited AEs: expressed in [days]  
• The relative day is calculated as the day of first symptom intensity recording > 0.

as their 95% CI .  This will be presented as ratio and the corresponding 95% CI in the original 
scale .  Fold increase in the main study visits will be based on the main baseline; fold increase in 
the booster visits will b e based on the booster baseline .  
Other  immunogenicity endpoints  
All other immunogenicity results (PRNT strain B, ELISPOT, ELISA IgG/IgA) will be considered 
as secondary descriptive analyses and will be analyzed similarly to PRNT (A strain) titers .  Fold 
increases will not be calculated or analyzed for ELISPOT assays.  
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs)  
For all ELISA and PRNT results the GMTs will be calculated by [CONTACT_243659] 10 titer transformations.  
Descriptive statistics will  be derived by [CONTACT_243660], Min, median, 
Max, GMT, with 95% CI (derived by [CONTACT_243661] 95% CI of the log 10 titer 
transformations based on the percentiles of the t -distribution).  
Geometric Mean Spot Forming Units (ELISPOT ) 
SFU/[ADDRESS_295613].  
A non -parametric percentile based CI ( Hahn , 1991) will be placed around the median for each 
treatment group . 
The calculation of the 95% CI for the Geometric Means will be based upon the assumption that 
the logarithm of the  SFU has a normal distribution.  
Seropositivity rates  
RSV -specific ELISA and PRNT seropositivity rates will be presented by [CONTACT_243662] -Pearson 95% CIs.

 According to the clinical trial protocol no new AEs should be reported during the BFU Phase, 
except SAEs, but if any are reported then they will be listed but considered non -treatment -
emergent and no summary  will be presented . 
Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs (solicited and unsolicited) with onset from booster vaccination  up to and including 
BEAP will be summarized by [CONTACT_3592]. Related SAEs and SAEs which occurred during the 
BFU Phase will be presented in a similar fas hion.  
Related Grade [ADDRESS_295615] listings for Grade 3 or higher AEs 
will be presented.  
Solicited Local Adverse Events  
Solicited local AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_243693], and broken down by [CONTACT_77275]. The incidence (i.e., the number of subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a specified solicited local AE on 
the day of vaccination or over the seven day s after vaccination divided by [CONTACT_243694] ) will be calculated. The incidence will also be calculated for any 
solicited local AE by [CONTACT_1570]. The incidence of Grade 2 or higher AEs will also be 
calculated as well  as the incidence of Grade 3 or higher AEs.  
The duration (in days) of the solicited local AEs will be summarized and presented in a listing. A 
similar table and listing will be presented for relative day of onset for solicited local AEs.  
Solicited General Adverse Events  
Solicited general AEs will be summarized in the same manner as solicited local AEs. In addition, 
a summary table will be produced for general AEs with reasonable possibility of relationship to 
trial vaccine, where relationship is defined as either possible, probable, definite, or missing.  
Also, the number of general AE s by [CONTACT_243695].  
Pre-treatment Adverse Events  
AEs recorded after signing the informed consent form , but before administra tion of the booster 
vaccine , are considered pre -treatment AEs. These pre -treatment AEs will be presented in a 
subject listing.

4.5.9 Clinical Laboratory Exams (Hematology, Chemistry)  
All measured hematology and chemis try values (and changes from booster baseline for 
continuous parameters) will be listed and summarized at each sampling visit using descriptive 
statistics (mean, SD, median, Min and Max).  
Summary tables will be produced for the number of high and low labor atory values at BV0 , 
booster baseline, BV2 and BEAP  by [CONTACT_243672].  
In addition, all clinical laboratory values outside the normal range will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], 
gender, age and flagging of abnormal values (LN=Below normal range, HN=Above normal 
range) with their clinical significance.  
Shift tables will be used to evaluate categorical changes from booster baseline  to BV2  with 
respect to normal ranges ( LN, Normal, HN) in hematology and biochemistry parameters.  
Booster baseline is de fined as last available measurements prior to the booster vaccination.  This 
will be different from the booster screening measurement when the subject has missing screening 
value or has multiple screening values.

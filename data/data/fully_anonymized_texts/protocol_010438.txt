Research  Summary  
Lay Summary – Complete dentures represent the traditional dental treatment for patients without teeth. However, 
retention  and stability  of this type  of denture  are often  lacking,  so dental  implants  are indicated  in order  to improve  the 
stability of the denture, along with the satisfaction  of the patient. Usually,  the dental implants  are inserted  and then  a 
period of [ADDRESS_877215] on quality of life through questionnaires.

Background  & Significance  
Since  the first application,  implant -supported  overdentures  have  been  shown  to be a reliable  and long -term  predictable 
treatment  option  for completely  edentulous  patients  in terms  of both  prosthodontic  and implant  outcomes  (Attard,  et 
al., 2004). Besides providing retention and stability, dental implants assist in reducing the impact of tissue borne 
edentulous  prosthesis  and are considered  the best  option  when  the patient  is not able  to acquire  new  muscular  patterns 
and cope with complete dentures (Mericske -Stern, 1994): it has been reported that implant rehabilitations slow the 
rate of residual ridge resorption (Adell, et al., 1981), increase the masticatory efficiency (Geertaman, et al., 1994) 
(Mericske -Stern,  1998)  and improve  the stability  and retention  of dentures  (Jemt,  et al., 1996).  Moreover,  compared  to 
the conventional removable prosthesis, implant overdentures result in an improvement of the general health -related 
quality  of life, with  an evident  social  and psychological  impact  for the benefit  of the patient  (Heydecke,  et al., 2003).  In 
particular, according to a recent prospective study, patient satisfaction significantly increased for implant -supported 
maxillary dentures compared with old dentures in all seven OHIP parameters (functional limitation, physical pain, 
psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, handicap), as well as for  cleaning 
ability, general satisfaction, ability to speak, comfort, esthetics, and stability (Zembic, Wismeijer 2014).  
 
Nowadays, in edentulous mandibles, two -implant overdentures represent the minimum standard, since they provide 
excellent long -term success and survival, including patient satisfaction and improved oral functions (Carlsson, 2014). 
However, on implant -supported maxillary overdentures, consensus or a treatment concept is lacking. Maxillary 
overdentures can be considered a favorable treatment in cases of insufficient bone volume and complaints about 
retention and stability of the full denture (Visser, et al., 2009). Based on survival rate studies, 4 endosseous implants 
are regarded the minimum number needed to support a maxillary overdenture (Rodriguez, et al., 2000) (Jivraj , et al., 
2006)  (Sadowsky,  2007),  with  a high  implant  and prosthetic  survival  rate (> 95%  per year)  (Raghoebar,  et al., 2014),  with 
either  a bar or a ball attachment  (Slot,  et al., 2010).  Regarding  the prosthetic  components,  unsplinted  anchorage  require 
less space, are usually easier to clean and more economical, as well as less technique sensitive (Watson, et al., 2001). 
Moreover, according to recent literature systematic reviews, it seems that there is no significant difference in mean 
bone loss and success rate between ball or bar -retained overdentures (Trakas, et al., 2006) (Sadowsky, 2007) .  
 
The original Bränemark protocol dictated that the initial phase of implant osseointegration should be at least 4 -6 
months before any prosthetic restoration is placed (Bränemark, 1983).  However, technological advancements have 
resulted in modern dental implant protocols that provide the possibility to immediately load implants, with the 
advantage of reducing the length of treatment time and satisfying patient demands (Chung, 2011). In addition, this 
protocol avoids the recourse of a removable prosthetic whose placement may interfere with healing (Collaert, et al., 
2008).  In numerous  clinical  trials,  immediate  loading  has been  shown  to have  excellent  survivability  and now  is deemed 
a reliable treatment option for edentulism in the mandible, with an overall survival rate greater than 98% (Chiapasco, 
2004), both for fixed or removable full restorations. The reported success in immediate loading in the mandible has 
encouraged  the application  of a similar  treatment  in the maxilla.  Compared  to the mandible,  the main  factor  which  has 
been  considered  to jeopardize  the success  for maxillary  overdentures  is related  mainly  to poorer  bone  density  (Nordin, 
et al., 2007). Lekholm and Zarb described maxillary bone as more trabecular and softer in nature (type 3 or type 4), 
whereas mandibular bone is more cancellous and denser (type 1 or type 2) (Lekholm, et al., 1985). This anatomic 
difference results in lower primary stability and, in case of immediate loading, may expose the implants to the risk of 
excessive micromotions (Trisi, et al., 2009) (Javed, et al., 2013): if the implant undergoes micromovements exceeding 
150 µm, new bone formation will be prevented and a non -calcified, collagenous poorly vascularized scar tissue will 
characterize the interface (Brunski, et al., 1979) (Szmukler -Moncler, et al., 2000).  
 
Consequently, these factors advice the use of moderately rough surfaced implants (Sa =1.0 -2.0 µm), which lead to 
higher  bone -to-implant  contact  [CONTACT_653774]: Design  
WVU+kc  Protocol  #: [PHONE_13545] 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_653769]:15 -Dec-2021Expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054]:14 -Dec-2022Number:[PHONE_13545]   (Albrektsson, et al., 2004) (Buser, et al., 1998). In addition, these surfaces have been demonstrated to maximize the 
osteoconductivity of the device (Sul, et al., 2005), allowing an accelerated healing process of the alveolar tissue 
(Abrahamsson, et al., 2003), due to a mechanism known as de novo bone formation (Davies, 1998) (Berglundh, et al., 
2003). For these reasons, moderately rough surfaces find a clinical application in immediate loading protocols and 
particularly where bone density and quantity are inadequate to achieve the initial stability of implants (Fung, et al., 
2011).  
 
According to the recent scientific evidence, provided an optimal primary stability, immediate loading has not been 
shown to compromise osseointegration in the mandible nor in the maxilla (Olsson, et al., 2003) (Romanos, 2009) 
([LOCATION_009]tti,  et al., 2012)  (Vervaeke,  et al., 2013).  Moreover,  some  authors  confirmed  that immediate  loading  can achieve 
similar  success  rates  as those  observed  with  early  or delayed  loading  approaches  (Chiapasco,  2004)  (Chen,  et al., 2004) 
(Avila, et al., 2007) (Ostman, et al., 2008). Experiments that were conducted on animals have been shown that 
immediate  loading can produce greater levels  of osseointegration  and in some  cases a  more  favorable  bone  architecture 
with which to resist functional stress (Neugebauer, et al., 2006) (Romanos, et al., 2003). A recent RCT comparing 
immediate - and delayed -loading implants supporting a mandibular overdenture reported a statistically significant 
reduction in  marginal bone loss around immediate -loading implants at 12 months, compared  to the delayed  implants, 
with  no difference  in frequency  of maintenance  visits  and prosthetic  complications  between  the groups  (Schincaglia,  et 
al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been published about immediate -loaded maxillary 
overdentures.  
 
Another  interesting  aspect  of immediate  loading  of implants  regards  the patient -related  outcomes:  previous  studies  in 
the immediate  loading  of two dental  implants  mandibular  overdentures  showed  a substantial  improvement  in patients' 
satisfaction and quality of life (Sara, Nikolai e Lesle 2009) (Emami, et al. 2016). The same results would reasonably be 
expected for immediate -loaded maxillary overdenture.  
 
In order to avoid or limit the need of bone augmentation, reduced diameter implants have been introduced. Narrow 
implants  have  been  used  for different  applications,  such  as limited  tooth -to-tooth  spacing  (Reddy,  et al., 2008)  (Cordaro, 
et al.,  2006),  partially edentulous  patients  (Barter,  et al., 2012)  (Romeo,  et al.,  2006),  edentulous  mandibles (Flanagan, 
2011) and recently also edentulous maxillae (Veltri, et al., 2008) (Hallman, 2001). In particular, a recent study 
(Cannizzaro, et al., 2007) evaluated the use of reduced diameter implants made of Ti -Zr alloy supporting maxillary 
overdentures retained with locator abutments: after [ADDRESS_877218], only one 
implant  showed  bone  resorption  greater  than  1.5 mm,  with  an overall  success  rate of 97.5%  and a survival  rate of 100%. 
In that study, Ti -Zr implants were used, in order to compensate the potential drawback of the reduced diameter 
titanium implants, that is a lower mechanical strength, with the related risk of fracture, especially at the implant - 
abutment interface.  
 
During the last decades, particular attention has been focused on the computer –guided and –navigated surgery, with 
the development of different strategies to transfer the digitally planned implant positions to the patient (Van Assche 
N, 2012).  This methodology has been shown to have numerous advantages: high precision in the implant placement, 
maximization of bone anchorage to the implant, reduction of surgical time and reduction of patient morbidity 
(Vercruyssen, et al. 2014). For this reason, nowadays computer -guided surgery is a validated and reliable option for 
implant placement.  
 
Considered  the insufficiency  of clinical  documentation  for immediate  loading  protocols  in maxilla,  the aim of this study 
is to assess  the clinical  and radiographic  performance  of Roxolid ™ 3.[ADDRESS_877219] -loading  supporting 
a maxillary overdenture, using a flapless guided surgery and an immediate loading protocol.

Study  Design  & Methodology  
General  overview  
This study will be performed at the WVU School of Dentistry. Total number of patients is from a minimum of 15/[ADDRESS_877220]: Straumann accepted to partly sponsor the study, providing some financial support and  materials  (implants 
and abutments).  Also,  study  participants  will receive  $100  as reimbursement  for travel  expenses  for each of the 3 months, 
6 months and 12 months  recall visits, ( visit 6,7,and 8  as per visit schema) for a total of  $300 .  
Pre-treatment  procedures  
An initial  evaluation  will be conducted  to determine  whether  a patient  meets  the study  inclusion  criteria.  This evaluation 
will include medical history, clinical examination and radiographic examination (OPT). A pre -operative prosthetic 
evaluation of the existing prostheses will be made to establish their quality and the need for a new set of complete 
dentures  before  the implant  placement.  The maxillary  denture  will be used  as radiographic  guide  for the pre-treatment 
CBCT  assessment.  The tridimensional  image  obtained  with  the CBCT  will be used  for the surgical  planning  of the implant 
positioning  by [CONTACT_15276] a dedicated  implant  planning  software  (coDiagnostix,  Dental  Wings  Gbmh,  Chemniz  [LOCATION_013])) 
and a stereo -lithographic  surgical guide will obtained.  
 
Surgical  procedures  
The implants will be inserted under local anesthesia, following consumption of prophylactic antibiotic medications 
consisting  of 2 grams  of amoxicillin  1 hour  before  the surgical  procedure.  If the patient  is allergic  to penicillin  or penicillin 
derivatives, clindamycin or other classes of antibiotics will be administered according to ADA guidelines. The implant 
placement will be performed using the stereo -lithographic surgical guide with a flapless approach, that is no crestal 
incision and flap elevation is needed. The osteotomy site will be prepared following the drilling sequence provided by 
[CONTACT_653775]. The implant will be placed and the maximum value of insertion torque (peak of 
insertion  torque,  IT) will be measured during the seating of the most coronal implant threads by [CONTACT_653776] (W&H, Burmoos, Austria) and recorded as 20, 30, 40, 50 N/cm IT category. In case of IT lower than 20 N/cm the 
implant  will not be  immediately  loaded;  the patient  will be excluded from the  study and the  implant treatment will  be 
completed  following  the standard  delayed  protocol.  Novaloc  TiN abutments  will be secured  on the implant  at 10 N/cm 
torque.  retained  immediately -loaded  maxillary  complete  dentures .. 
 
Null  Hypothesis  
No difference  in the radiographic  and clinical  parameters  between  baseline,  [ADDRESS_877221] -operative  intervals.  
 
Primary  Objective  – The primary  objective  of this study  is to evaluate  radiographically  at [ADDRESS_877222] -loading 
the performance  of the Roxolid ™ BLX 3.[ADDRESS_877223] implant placement.  
 
Secondary  Objective(s)  – The secondary  objectives  include  evaluation  of: 
• Condition  of the peri-implant  mucosa  (pocket  depth  and bleeding  on probing).  
• Implant  stability  quotient  (ISQ)  at baseline  and 12 months  
• Implant  survival  at 6 months  and 1 year  
• The nature  and the frequency  of surgical  and prosthetic  complications  
• Patient -centred  outcomes  (OHIP  14) 
• Accuracy  of the implant  placement  (additional  CBCT  is required)

The denture will  be immediately  connected  to the implants. The Novaloc  TiN cap attachments will  be pi[INVESTIGATOR_653770] - 
orally  using  cold  curing  resin.  To avoid  contact  [CONTACT_653777],  a circular  portion  of a sterile  rubber 
dam sheet  will be adapted on the cap attachment once placed on the Locator abutment during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_653771]. 
Occlusion is then checked and adjusted if necessary as well as the adaptation on the residual ridges and the patient 
dismissed.  As post -surgical  instructions,  the patients  will be asked  not to brush  the operated  areas  and to rinse  instead 
with  0,12%  chlorhexidine  solution  twice  a day for [ADDRESS_877224] -operative visit 
occlusion will be checked, as well as stability and retention of the prostheses and the need for any prosthetic 
maintenance.  Periapi[INVESTIGATOR_653772]  6 and  12 months visit by  [CONTACT_653778] 
a Rinn (Dentsply Rinn, Elgin, Illinois, [LOCATION_003]) film holder. The film holder will be indexed on the Locator attachment so 
that the film position could be reproduced for the follow up radiographs. All patient complaints or any complications 
resulting from a change in health status from baseline or any implant related complications such as pain, parasthesia 
or peri -implant infection will be recorded as an adverse event in the CRF and will be monitored until the condition is 
resolved. OHIP -14 questionnaire will be  administered  at baseline,  at 2 weeks’ post -surgery  and at  3 months, 6  months 
and 1 year.  
 
Outcome  variables  
The following  clinical  parameters  will be considered  for treatment  evaluation:  
 
Independent  Variables  
• Patient  age

• Wearing  complete  dentures  deemed  adequate  
• Orthopantomogram  available  (OPT)  
• Adequate  amount  of bone  at least  at the 2nd premolar  position  to house  a 3.75  x 10 mm implant  
• No bone  grafting  required  
• Implant  IT ≥ 20 N/cm  
 
Exclusion  Criteria  – These  are both  systemic  and local  exclusion  criteria: 
Systemic exclusion criteria  
• Conditions  requiring  chronic  routine  prophylactic  use of antibiotics  
• Conditions  requiring  prolonged  use of steroids  
• History  of leukocyte  dysfunction  and deficiencies  
• Bleeding  disorders

baseline. The RBL change will be calculated in comparison with the baseline value.  
 
Prosthetic  complications  
The number  and nature  of prosthetic  complications  will be recorded  as well as the number  and nature  of any unplanned 
visit for each group.  
 
Patient -centered  outcomes  
Patient centered outcomes will be recorded through the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP -14), which is a 14 -items 
questionnaire designed to measure self -reported functional limitation, discomfort and disability attributed to oral 
conditions  (Slade  1997).  The OHIP -14 has been  shown  to be reliable  (Slade  1997);  sensitive  to changes  (Locker,  Jokovic 
e Clarke 2004) and it has adequate cross -cultural consistency (Allison, et al. 1999).  
 
Accuracy  of the guided  system  
The Software will compare the actual position of the implants with the pre -surgical planned placement. Difference in 
angulation and depth will be recorded. A second CBCT will be performed immediately after the surgical placement of 
the implants.

Vulnerable Populations – Since implant therapy is regarded as an elective treatment, no vulnerable populations 
(children, cognitively impaired individuals, pregnant women and fetuses, prisoners, WVU/UHA/WVUH employees, or 
WVU students) will be included in the study populations.  
 
Recruitment – Patients will be recruited within WVU Dental Clinics: patients identified as potential candidates will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I, in order to verify the possibility to participate in the study. If the patient meets the 
requirements, PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I, fully trained according to Human Research Criteria, will be presenting the protocol and 
consenting  the patient.  The types  of advertisement  methods  will include  flyer  and bulletin  board.  The ads will be placed 
at: Dental Clinics, Reception areas, Common areas in the Health Science Center. Advertisements clearly state that 
research is being conducted, the department/agency conducting the research – along with the PI/Co -I contact 
[CONTACT_3031], time commitment to the participant, inclusion/exclusion criteria, that participation is voluntary, and that 
WVU IRB approval is on file.  
 
Risk &  Benefit  
 
 
Statistical  Analysis  Plan  
 Primary  outcome  variables  will test for  normal  distribution  and two-way Paired  t test or Student  t-test will be used  to 
compare the means. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe patient population. Non -parametric inferential  Risk  – The risks  for the participants  are represented  by [CONTACT_653780],  which 
may include: implant failure, pain; postoperative discomfort; swelling; restricted mouth opening that may last for 
several days; bleeding; infection requiring additional treatment; stretching of the corners of the mouth resulting in 
cracking and/or bruising; change in the occlusion (bite); jaw joint pain; fracture of the jaw; injury to nerve branches; 
numbness or tingling of the lip, gums, cheek that may last for several months.  
 
Benefit – The advantages of implant rehabilitations for the patients include: improved stability and retention of 
denture; increased masticatory efficiency; slower rate of bone ridge resorption. In particular, according to a recent 
prospective study, patient satisfaction significantly increased for implant -supported maxillary dentures compared  
with  old dentures  in all seven  OHIP  parameters  (functional  limitation,  physical  pain,  psychological  discomfort,  physical 
disability,  psychological  disability,  social  disability,  handicap),  as well as for cleaning  ability,  general  satisfaction,  ability 
to speak, comfort, esthetics, and stability (Zembic, Wismeijer 2014). The single patient may not receive any direct

Confidentiality  & Privacy  
Confidentiality – All data collected will be kept for a  minimum of  [ADDRESS_877225]  protected  database.  All participant  identifiers  will be stored  separately  from  the data  collected.  
 
Privacy – The following procedures will be used to protect the confidentiality of the data. The study staff (principal 
investigator, research coordinator, co -investigators etc.) will keep all study records (including any codes to your data) 
locked in a secure location in a file cabinet in the office of the principal investigator. Research records will be labeled 
with a code.  The code will  be a sequential [ADDRESS_877226] from research data. All electronic files (e.g., database, spreadsheet, etc.) 
containing  identifiable  information  will be password  protected.  Any computer  hosting  such  files will also have  password 
protection  to prevent  access  by [CONTACT_50000]-authorized  users.  Data  that will be shared  with  the authorities  of Straumann  will be 
de-identified to help protect your identity.  Information regarding your implant treatment, health information such as 
laboratory  test results  and dental  X-rays are also kept  in a dental  record  which  will be stored  at the University  in a locked 
cabinet  with  restricted  access.  We will do our best  to protect  the confidentiality  of the information  we gather  from  you 
but we cannot guarantee 100% confidentiality.  You should know that the sponsor, Straumann, the Department of 
Health  and Human  Services,  the Food  and Drug  Administration,  the Health  Center’s  Institutional  Review  Board  and the 
Human  Subjects  Protection  Office  may  inspect  records.  They  may  inspect  records  to ensure  that the study  is being  done 
correctly.  Also,  if during  the course  of this study  we learn  of child,  elder,  or spousal  abuse  or of communicable  diseases, 
we are required to report it to State officials.  The informed consent will be given to the patient first screening visit. The patient will be given the opportunity to ask 
questions  about  the research  and to receive  answers  about  areas  the patient  does  not understand.  The patient  will be 
asked to read the informed consent document carefully and, if necessary, to discuss about the research with family 
members, primary care physicians or friends before making a decision.  The patients’  PHI will include:

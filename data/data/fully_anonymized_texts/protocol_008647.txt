Objectives:  Primary:  To determine the PK profile after single dose subQ injection(s) of 10 
μg/kg and 20 μg/kg ALT-803 at concentrations of 1.0 mg/mL or 2.0 mg/mL.  
 
Secondary:  To assess safety after single dose subQ injection(s) of 10 μg/kg 
and 20 μg/kg ALT-803 at concentrations of 1.0 mg/mL or 2.0 mg/mL.  
 
Study Design: This is a single center, open-label, pharmacokinetic study of ALT-803 
administered as a subQ injection to healthy volunteers.  
 
Subjects meeting the entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (n = 8 ; 
Groups A and B) to one of two ALT-803 drug concentrations. Subjects 
randomized to Group A will receive 1.0 mg/mL ALT-803 and subjects in 
Group B will receive 2.0 mg/mL ALT-803. Groups A and B will receive a 
single 10 µg/kg subQ dose of ALT-803. After a Rest Period, groups A and B 
will receive a single 20 µg/kg subQ dose of ALT-803. 
  
Blood samples to determine serum levels of ALT-803 will be collected prior 
to dosing, and at 1, 4, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 192 hours after dosing.

7.1 Clinical Assessments and Procedures 
7.1.1 Medical History 
A complete medical history (e.g. review of all body systems, summary of all illnesses, surgeries, 
allergies, drug sensitivities, menstrual history for women, and methods of contraception) will be 
performed at screening. Medical history will also include history of drug, nicotine and alcohol 
consumption. 
7.1.2 Physical Examination  
A complete physical exam [head, eyes, ears, nose , throat, skin, heart, lun gs, abdomen, extremities, 
and neurological (e.g. level of consciousness, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], motor and sensory responses, and reflexes)] 
will be performed at screening and a routine physical exam will be performed on all study visits 
per schedule of assessments. 
7.1.3 Vital Signs, Body Weight & Height 
Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temperature) will be collected at 
screening and at study visits per Schedule of Assessments ( Section 4.3 ). Vital signs will be 
performed prior to, and one-hour post-ALT-803 subQ injection. On PK sample collection days, 
vital signs are to be collected prior to blood draw. Height (in cm) will be measured at screening 
and body weight (in kg) will be noted before each ALT-803 subQ injection.  
7.1.4 General Health Questionnaire 
The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), RAND 36-item Short Form Survey 1.0 (SF-36) will be 
completed by [CONTACT_417059] 1, study period 1, and at the Follow-up visit, p lease 
refer to ( Section 16.2 ). The subject must complete the GHQ at the PK Unit (research site) during 
the scheduled visit. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_526070] Diary and Digital Photographic Documentation 
The ALT-803 Injection Site Reaction Diary ( Section 16.1 ) will be given to subjects on the day that 
the ALT-803 subQ injection is administered (Day 1 of Study Period 1 and 2). The diary is to be 
completed by [CONTACT_417060], whichever is 
longer. The subject will return the completed diaries to the study coordinator.  
Since injection site reactions are an adverse event, close clinical follow up is a requirement. Prior 
to subQ injection of ALT-803, a photograph should be taken of the injection area (i.e. right 
abdomen). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_417029], whichever is longer (Schedule of Assessments, Section 4.3 ), a camera with a minimum 
of 10 megapi[INVESTIGATOR_417030], and 2 views of the lesion (one identifying the region of the body 
and one close-up) should be taken. An adhesive label with the study I.D., PID, patient initials, date, 
time and the corresponding number of the photo (i.e. image 1 or image 2) should be placed next 
to the injection site (on the skin) for both views (please see photographic example below).

9.1 Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
An adverse event ( AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may 
appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurre nt illness, a 
worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, 
including laboratory test values ( Section 9.3 ), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing  condition ) 
should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the 
case report form (CRF) rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
If death occurs, this must be reported as an SAE to the Sponsor or their designated safety group 
within [ADDRESS_526097]’s source documents. When an AE/SAE occurs, the Investigator is expected to review 
all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], consultations, laboratory and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration 
of the study drug and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as “not suspected” or “suspected”. The 
Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/IEC of SAEs and providing them with all 
relevant initial and follow-up information about the event as applicable. The Investigator must 
keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_417039], including correspondence with Altor BioScience or 
Nant Safety and the IRB/IEC of record. 
Please report all SAEs within 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the event by [CONTACT_6968] 
([EMAIL_7958]), using the provided Serious Adverse Event Report Form and 
SAE Fax Cover Sheet  (Section 16.3 ). Please attach available copi[INVESTIGATOR_417040]/de-identified 
relevant source documents. Upon review of the SAE Report Form, Altor BioScience or its safety 
group, Nant Safety (an identical copy of the email sent to Altor will be automatically generated 
and sent to Nant Safety), may request the site to provide additional de-identified source 
documents describing the event.

803, AND THAT HE/SHE IS LISTED ON THE FDA 1572.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/IEC of SAEs and providing them with all 
relevant initial and follow-up information about the event as applicable. The Investigator must 
keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_417039], including correspondence with Altor BioScience or

9.2 Evaluation of Adverse Events 
Assignment of a grade of adverse events based on intensity of symptoms, degree of limitation of 
daily activities, or level of abnormality of objective clinical signs or laboratory parameters using 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events V4.03 (CTCAE). 
9.2.1 Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE that fulfils one or more of the following: 
•Results in death.
•Is life-threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject is at immediate risk
of death from the AE as it occurred).
•Requires in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_417041]-subject admission, regardless of length of stay).
•Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (a substantial disruption of the
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
•Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect.
•Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Important medical events are
defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical and
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be
considered serious.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.  
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the study drug, action taken regarding the study drug, and outcome. 
Altor BioScience 16.1.1 Protocol CA-ALT- 803-03-17 
ALT- 803 
Confidential  Page 44 of 95  9.2.2 Severity/Intensity 
The severity/intensity of AEs and SAEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms 
according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf  
AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 should be evaluated for severity/intensity 
according to the following scale:  
•Grade 1 = Mild: transient or mild discomfort, no limitation in activity; no medical
intervention/therapy required.
•Grade 2 = Moderate: mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.
•Grade 3 = Severe: marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841].
•Grade 4 = Life threatening: extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required;
significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595].
•Grade 5 = Death: the event results in death.
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] 9.2.[ADDRESS_526098] determine the relationship between the administration of the study drug and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as “not suspected” or “suspected,” as defined below:  
•Not suspected: The temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or remote, or other medications,
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the
observed event.
•Suspected: The temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study drug administration
makes a causal relationship possible, and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or
underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary, or additional study 
drug that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_417067], please provide the name [CONTACT_198532]. 
Altor BioScience  16.1.[ADDRESS_526099] of the start and stop dates of the event. 
Please see study specific CRF data entry completion guidelines and SAE report completion 
guidelines for instructions for capturing the start and stop dates of AEs and SAEs. 
9.2.5 Action Taken 
The Investigator will report the action taken with the study drug as a result of any AE or SAE, as 
applicable (e.g., discontinuation of the study drug) and report if concomitant and/or additional 
treatments were given for the event. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_526100]’s last dose of the study drug. AEs will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization. All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the 
subject’s participation in the study must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not 
recovered (death due to other cause), death (due to the SAE), lost to follow up, or otherwise 
explained. 
9.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study;  
• Requires treatment, modification/interruption of the study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention; or  
• Is judged to be of significant clinical importance.  
Regardless of the severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion

9.5 Pregnancy 
9.5.1 Females of Child-Bearing Potential 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on the study drug, or within [ADDRESS_526102]’s last dose of the study drug, are considered immediately reportable events.  
The study drug is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or 
positive pregnancy test must be reported to Altor BioScience/Nant Safety (an identical copy of 
email sent to Altor will be automatically generated and sent to Nant Safety) immediately by [CONTACT_6968] 
([EMAIL_7958]), using the Pregnancy Questionnaire ( Section 16.6 ). The female 
subject may be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist (not necessarily one with reproductive 
toxicity experience) or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation.  
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy and must notify 
Altor BioScience Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Follow-up Pregnancy Questionnaire ( Section 16.6 ).

ALT- 803 
Confidential  Page 49 of 95  If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the 
Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of 
the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Altor BioScience/Nant Safety by [CONTACT_6968] 
([EMAIL_7958]), within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using 
the SAE Report Form.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_526103] to causality, 
as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in 
utero  exposure to the study drug should also be reported to Altor BioScience/Nant Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_6968] ([EMAIL_7958]), within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the event using the SAE Report Form. Male Subjects 
If a female partner of a male subject taking the study drug becomes pregnant, the male subject  
should notify the Investigator as soon as possible, who will provide a copy of the Pregnant Partner 
Informed Consent Form and a copy of the pregnancy questionnaire to the male study subject to 
provide to the pregnant partner.  
If the pregnant partner consents, she will check the appropriate box on the consent form, sign the 
consent form, and complete the pregnant partner questionnaire; the male subject will also sign the 
consent form and provide the pregnant partner with the Investigator’s contact [CONTACT_417069]. The male subject shall return the 
signed consent form and completed questionnaire to the study coordinator or Investigator. The 
pregnant partner will be contact[CONTACT_417070] (e.g., live 
birth, etc.) and will be contact[CONTACT_1006] [ADDRESS_526104] that a 
pregnancy occurred and that the pregnant partner refused consent. 
9.6 Reporting of Adverse Events 
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in  
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. All SAEs must be reported to Altor 
BioScience Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], 
email using the SAE Report Form. This instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any 
follow-up reports.  
SAE Reporting information:  
Email: [EMAIL_7959]  
(an identical copy of email sent to Altor will be automatically generated and sent to Nant Safety)  
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms are accurate and consistent. This 
requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to the study drug) that occur during the 
study (from the time the subject signs informed consent to [ADDRESS_526105] dose of the study 
drug), and those made known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being 
related to the study drug.  
Altor BioScience  16.1.[ADDRESS_526106] be included.  
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or 
independent ethics committee (IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and 
follow-up information about the event. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_417045]/IEC. 
9.7  Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
For events considered related to the study drug by [CONTACT_737], Altor BioScience Drug Safety 
will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to ALT-803 based on the 
Investigational Brochure.  
 
AEs such as disease progression, death related to disease progression (in the absence of serious 
study drug-related events), and serious events due to the relapse of the studied indication will not 
be subject to expedited reporting by [CONTACT_417071].  
 
Altor BioScience or its authorized representative shall notify (no later than 15 calendar days of 
receipts per regulations) the Investigator of the following information:  
• Any AE suspected of being related to the use of the study drug in this study or in other 
studies that is both serious and unexpected (i.e., S[LOCATION_003]R).  
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human 
subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/IEC promptly of these 
new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.  
 
[ADDRESS_526107] deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous data, and frequencies and percentages 
for categorical data.  No statistical testing will be performed.   
10.2 Sample Size 
A total of 16 patients will be enrolled (8 patients in Group A and 8 patients in Group B)   
Altor BioScience  16.1.[ADDRESS_526108] one dose of ALT-803.  
The evaluable population (for pharmacokinetics) will include all subjects who have received both

documentation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor, its authorized 
representative(s), and Investigator(s) abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as described in the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the 
general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval 
from an IRB/IEC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study 
in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
11.[ADDRESS_526112]  the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (e.g., 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data 
verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.  
11.[ADDRESS_526113]’s entry into 
the study and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source 
documents, including the date. The original informed consent document signed and dated by [CONTACT_417073]’s entry into 
the study must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. 
In addition, if a protocol is amended and the amendment(s) impact the content of the informed 
consent, the informed consent document must be revised. Study subjects participating in the study 
when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-consented with the revised version of the 
Altor BioScience  16.1.[ADDRESS_526114] be maintained in the 
Investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  
11.4 Confidentiality 
The Sponsor (Altor BioScience), affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of 
privacy and to be in compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). 
The Sponsor requires the Investigator to permit the Sponsor and/or their designated representatives 
and, when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any 
medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed informed consent document, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain 
such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.  
Subjects will be identified only by [CONTACT_395043].  
11.[ADDRESS_526115] to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within [ADDRESS_526116] be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the Investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. Altor BioScience will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for approval. 
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the Investigator, and/or Altor BioScience, the amendment to 
the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject 
and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved 
written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent 
will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
11.[ADDRESS_526117]/Independent Ethics Committee Review and Approval 
The Investigator must obtain IRB/IEC approval for the investigation. Initial IRB/IEC approval, 
and all materials approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC for this study, including the subject consent form and 
recruitment materials, must be maintained by [CONTACT_7213].  
The final study protocol, including the final version of the Informed Consent Form, must be 
approved or given a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_57719]. The Investigator 
must submit written approval to Altor BioScience before he or she can enroll any subject into the 
study.  
Altor BioScience  16.1.[ADDRESS_526118]. 
Altor BioScience will provide this information to the Investigator.

All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by [CONTACT_417074](s) for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current 
GCP and SOPs.  
13.[ADDRESS_526122] into the study, a representative of Altor BioSc ience 
will:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities.  
• Discuss with the Investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence and the responsibilities of Altor BioScience or its representatives. This 
will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Altor BioScience and the 
Investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Altor BioScience or representative will have regular contacts 
with the research site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the Investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the research team is adhering to the protocol, data are being accurately 
recorded in the case report forms, and investigational product accountability checks are 
being performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the subject’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76831]. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject 
(e.g., clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Altor BioScience 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been forwarded to Altor BioScience and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting 
have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff needs information 
or advice. 
13.2 Deviations 
Deviations are defined as any departure from the IRB-approved protocol and significant non-
compliance with good clinical practices (GCP). Deviations may lead to increased risk to the study 
participant and may jeopardize the study data integrity. All protocol deviations discovered by [CONTACT_417075] 10 working days  for review and approval. Use the Protocol 
Deviation Guidelines to determine the deviation code  and classification and submit the  Protocol 
Deviation Notification Form  (Section 16.7 ) to Altor BioScience. Altor will notify the site to 
confirm that the deviation is properly coded, classified (Major or Minor) and is approved for entry 
Altor BioScience  16.1.1 Protocol CA-ALT- 803-03-17 
ALT- 803  
 
 
Confidential   Page 58 of 95  into the applicable CRF. If a CRA/Monitor discovers a protocol deviation, the CRA/Monitor will 
provide instructions to the site for entry into the applicable CRF.   If the Protocol Deviation is 
determined to be Major, the site should report it to their IRB of record in accordance with the 
IRB’s reporting requirements. The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for the final 
determination of IRB reportability. The following are examples of major protocol deviations: 
▪ Not adhering to inclusion/exclusion criteria for subject eligibility/enrollment 
▪ Missed dose of ALT-803 administration (unless held for safety) 
▪ Failure to report serious adverse events (SAE) 
▪ Failing to obtain informed consent prior to performing any study procedures 
▪ Working under an expi[INVESTIGATOR_417046]/certification 
▪ Failure to collect immunogenicity sample from all study participants at the site 
Minor protocol deviations should be reported as required to the site’s IRB of record (most minor 
deviations will not require IRB reporting). The following are examples of minor protocol 
deviations: 
▪ The study staff did not collect a sample for a lab test required by [CONTACT_760]  
▪ Subject failure to return General Health Questionnaires  
▪ Study visit out of timeframe 
▪ Failure to collect immunogenicity sample at one study visit for a subject 
In the event that the Investigator deviates from the protocol in the interest of subject safety, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_417047] 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the deviation using the 
Protocol Deviation Notification Form  (Section 16.7 ). All other deviations should be reported to 
the Sponsor within 10 working days.

the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an 
Altor BioScience audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-
related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data 
were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the 
ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator is required to permit direct 
access to the facilities where the study took place, source documents, CRFs, and applicable 
supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by [CONTACT_417078], regulatory authorities, and IRB/IECs. The Investigator should make every effort 
to be available for the audits and/or inspections. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_417079] a regulatory agency about an inspection.

Note: multiple vials may need to be used for each dose.  
2. Once subject is confirmed to meet dosing eligibility, withdraw the ALT-803 dose volume 
from the study drug vial(s) directly into a syringe(s) for subcutaneous injection.  
3. Label the syringe(s) at minimum with the Subject Initials and Study ID N o. (or other 
applicable subject identifying information), and Date Prepared. 
4. Distribute for subject treatment. 
5. Skip to Section C to complete this form. 
 
B. ALT -803 treatment preparation for 2 mg/mL concentration vials  
2. Use the following instructions to prepare each study medication dose using 2 mg/mL  concentration 
vials. ALT-803 will be diluted (1:1 dilution) to a concentration of 1 mg/mL  after confirming the volume 
needed. 
1. Calculate the ALT-803 dose volume  (mL) at 1 mg/mL  as follows:  
= [20 µg/kg (ALT-803 Dose level)  X  _____________  kg]    1000 µg/mL

Confidential   Page 91 of 95  16.16  APPENDIX X VI – Declaration of Helsinki 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
 
Ethical Principles 
for 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly 
Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_526138] the health of the people. The physician’s 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, 
"The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing medical 
care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Altor BioScience           16.1.[ADDRESS_526139]’s 
information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity 
and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, 
methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the 
researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. 
The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw 
consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood 
the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-written consent must 
be formally documented and witnessed. 
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
Altor BioScience           16.1.[ADDRESS_526140] obtain that assent in addition to the 
consent of the legally authorized representative. 
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or advance 
consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed 
consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving 
research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be 
stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee. The 
protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible 
from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate. 
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the 
Investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results 
should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations 
and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of 
experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be 
accepted for publication. 
 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE 
The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the research 
is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical research is 
combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the subjects who are research 
subjects. 
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of 
the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use 
of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic 
method exists. 
At the conclusion of the study, every subject entered into the study should be assured of access to 
the best-proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by [CONTACT_1758]. 
Altor BioScience           16.1.[ADDRESS_526141] be 
free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the physician’s 
judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where 
possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety 
and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. 
The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

Comparing the Effects of Upper and Lower Body Resistance Training on Pain Sensitivity  
NCT05 985382 
7/28/[ADDRESS_834683] session, participants underwent either a lower or upper body exercise in a 
counterbalanced order.  
Lower body exercise was a bilateral leg extension conducted at 75% of the estimated 1 repetition 
maximum.  3 sets of 10 repetitions were performed.  
Upper body exercise was a bilateral overhead shoulder press conducted at 75% of the estimated 1 
repetition maximum.  3 sets of 10 repetitions were performed.   
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
To examine the immediate changes in heat and pressure pain threshold by [CONTACT_3004], separate repeated 
measures  ANOVAs  were conducted.  Simple effects decomposition with Bonferroni correction were  
completed.  Our a priori alpha level is <0.05.

RESEARCH OVERVIEW/ABSTRACT  
This work will serve  both the Ever ett Clinic and broader UnitedHealth Group  patient  populations  as well 
as advance the  public health emergency (PHE) response  to the community spread of  SARS -CoV-2 virus , 
especially as the number of cases and deaths continues to rise in many geographies.  Leveraging our 
presence in the Seattle/Puget Sound area with Everett Clinic, we intend  to develop a model that can 
screen a large number of  patients  at varying levels of risk and manifestation of clinical sympt oms while 
conserving personal protective equipment (PPE) and decreasing transmission risk to health care 
workers. This will also ser ve to support the enterprise and public health response.  Towards this goal, we 
must first assess the equivalence between clinician -collected nasopharyn geal (NP)  samples  to both 
clinician - and patient -obtained mid -turbinate  (MT)  samples to detect SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_693955] cross -
section of the population.

1 STUDY  PURPOSE  & OBJECTIVES  
 
Measure the agreement  between the detection of SARS -CoV-2 virus using clinician collecte d 
nasopharyngeal (NP)  and clinician and patient collect mid -turbinate (MT) samples  in patients seen 
in an outpatient  clinic setting . 
 
 
2 JUSTIFICATION & BACKGROUND  
 
By [CONTACT_11711] 13, 2020, the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID -19) reached pandemic levels with 
1,[ADDRESS_693956] ed samples 
outside of the clin ic would not only minimize transmission but also reduce the amount personal 
protective equipment  (PPE), which already faces potential shortage.  
On March 9, 2020, the Governor of the state of Washington, Jay Inslee, announced on national TV 
that all COVID -[ADDRESS_693957] been lifted, allowing for anyone to call their provider and 
obtain testing.  The Governor’s announcement along with the growing nationwide COVID -19 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_534294] a high demand for SARS -CoV-2 virus testing. The current pa ndemic has 
created significant constraints in available PPE. In comparison with an NP sample, obtaining an MT 
sample is faster, usually better tolerated, safer, and causes less potential for sneezing, coughing and 
gagging, thus lowering the potential for a erosol generation during the collection process. Obtaining 
NP samples is technically more challenging than oropharyngeal (OP) and mid turbinate samples. 
Washington State Department of Health unpublished data s uggests  the recovery of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_693958]  results. For the purposes of reporting to patients, a result will be considered positive 
if any of the three tests (clinician NP, clinician MT, patient MT) returns a positive result . 
 
3.[ADDRESS_693959] SARS-CoV-2 virus testing conducted.  The samples will be marked 
according to location of collection from the nasal cavity  (i.e., MT or NP,), and who collects the sample 
(i.e., clinician or patient ).  This study is designed to confirm that sensitivity of test results from non -clinician 
obtained MT sample are acceptable compared to the clinician obtained NP sample  among individuals  
presenting clinical symptoms indicative of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] . The results will inform future , follow -
up research aimed at a constructing an operational framework to support rapid, less invasive testing of 
suspected  infectious patients  regardless of symptom manifestation  outside the clinic.  Th 
 
3.4 Data  
 
Three data sources will be recorded for each pa tient who consent s to participat e in the  study:  
• Electronic  medical record  (EMR) , including reported clinical symptoms at time of testing ;  
• Results of testing from the three  nasal swabs  collected ; 
• Responses to a set of standard questions posed to each participant.  
 
3.5 Materials  
 
Primary materials that will be used in this study include:  
• Flocked synthetic nasal swabs for the mid -turbinate testing ; 
• A thin synthetic nasal swab for the nasopharyngeal testing ; 
• A viral transport media tube  to be utilized  after collecting the sample - the end of the scored swab 
will be place in the viral transport media tube and broken off.  The cap will be placed and secured.   
 
All samples will be appropriately labeled with the patient identifie rs and if the patient or clin ician obtain ed 
the sample.  
 
3.6 Devices  
All swabs used for this study will be NasoSwab’s from MDL. This swab was chosen due to its nylon 
flocked con struction and a guard to ensure consistent depth.  It is also an existing brand currently 
utilized in clinics  for obtaining NP samples.  More details on the NasoSwab can be found at 
http://www.mdlab.com/pdf/nasoswab_brochure.pdf .

90%, assuming the true percentage is 98%. We selected 90% based on clinical expertise suggesting a 
test would not be practically useful below this threshold and 98% based on estimates from influenza 
testing4. Based on this hypothesis and a significance level of 0.05, we need to observe [ADDRESS_693961] results to attain 80% power. Assuming 9% prevalence, we expect to have to test a total of 533 
patients to observe 48 positive results. The same assumptions, hy pothesis, and final sample sizes are 
applicable to both a comparison of clinician -collected  NP to clinician -collected  MT and a comparison of 
clinician -collected  NP to patient -collected  MT.

4.7 Enroll ment / Consent Plan and Materials  
This is an operational project.  A verbal script will be used by [CONTACT_534296].  Any patient that has the three  samples collected would be 
considered as having willingly participated in the project as they allowed the sample collection and the 
use of the data produced from the sample.  
 
4.8 Compensa tion / Remuneration  / Reimbursement   
None  
 
 
5 STUDY PROCEDURES   
 
5.1 Procedures  
MT samples will be collected via the following steps:  
• Gently insert the swab in the horizontal position until there is gentle resistance  
• Leave the swab in for 10 -15 seconds on each side  
• Gently rotate the swab  
• Repeat on the other nostril with the same swab  
• Place the swab in viral transport media and break off  
 
NP samples will be collected via the following steps : 
• Use the skinny end in the horizonal position, gently pass the swab along the floor of the nose 
(straight back, not up the nose) until the posterior nasopharynx has been reached (distance from 
nostrils to external opening of ear) . Hint: Place finger on the tip of the patie nt/resident’s nose and 
depress slightly  
• Once resistance is met (the swab should pass into the pharynx relatively easily), rotate the swab 
several times and withdraw the swab  
• Break off top of swab (it will snap off)  
• Place in transport medium.

5.2 Participan t Engagement & Results  
Patients will be notified of test results per standard clinical practice.  A positive result will be reported to 
patients if any of the three collected samples returns a positive result.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_693965] is significantly greater than 90%. If the NP 
test is considered the ground truth, then this hypothesis test can be interpreted as testing whether the 
MT test has a sensitivity of at least 90%.  
As a secondary analysis we will also compare the percentage of patients with a positive result on the NP 
test that were also positive for the MT test between clinician - and patient -collected  tests using a two -
sided, two -sample test of proportio ns. Additional secondary analyses will include calculating the 
percentage of all patients that had a positive MT test and a negative NP test, breaking out the previous 
tests based on patient characteristics and symptoms, and other exploratory analyses.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_693966].  The collection locations and source of collection (medical 
personnel versus patient) will need to be clearly distinguished for the purposes of this project.  Data 
resulting from analysis of the samples will also be stor ed in the electronic medical record and any positive 
results will be reported accordingly to public health officials as required. The data collected due to this 
operational effort will be extracted from the medical record and stored for additional research  analysis to 
demonstrate equivalence between location in the nose for the collection of the sample and similarity 
between sample collected by [CONTACT_534297].  Data will be 
shared between the participating clinics, UH G and collaborating partners performing the analysis of the 
samples and returning results.  
 
7.2 Statistical Analysis  
Described in Section 6.4 , Data Analysis .  
 
7.3 Future Utilization  
If patient -collected MT samples prove capable of  mainta ining  an adequate level  of sensitivity (as defined 
in Section 4.2, Number of Subjects ) in comparison with clinician collected NP samples among 
symptomatic individuals in a clinical setting , we intend to develop a scalable -framework support ing 
SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_693967] our provider workforce and slow down the spread of COVID -
19 on both a national and global level . 
 
7.4 Publication Plan  
In an effort to minimize morbidity and mortality from COVID -19 as well as help facilitate pandemic 
containment, we will disseminate the findings of this study  thru any means of rapid editorial review, such 
as peer -reviewed journal, public health institutions and/or mainstream media.

  Overall Objective:  
 
The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical trial is to compare two currently accepted 
standard- of-care treatment strategies: m edical thoracoscopy as compared to instillation of 
intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and human recombinant d eoxyribonuclease 
(DNase) for the management of complicated pleural infections in adults  as defined as 
complicated parapneumonic effusions or pleural empyema.   
 Introductory Statement and Background:  
 Pleural infection ( empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion [ CPPE ]) represents one of the 
common clinical diagnoses encountered in clinical practice in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and worldwide.  The incidence of pleural infection continues to rise with an annual incidence of 
approximately 65,000 in the US and [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006] ).
1 It is associated with substantial 
morbidity and mortality as well as increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271472].
2-4 The overall mortality of pleural infection approaches 
20% and it is above 30% in elderly  patients over 65 years and immunocompromised patients.1,5-
8 
 
2 
 Treatment of CPPE or empyema requires antibiotics and drainage of the pleural cavity.3 
However, in about 30% of cases, it is difficult to remove the fluid due to loculations, septations 
and increased viscosity of the pleural fluid, and around 20% will need surgical intervention to 
adequately treat the pleural  infection.9,10 
 
Rationale:  
 
The intrapleural therapy of combined tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and human recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in the management of pleural infection has been 
shown to improve the chest radiographic appearance at day 7  in the Multi -center Intra- pleural 
Sepsis Trial (MIST2).
9 However, this approach is expensive, with a substantial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
(around 12 days) , and had a no significant  decrease in the rate of surgery referral as compared 
to placebo.[ADDRESS_330925] shown that around 80% of patients with pleural infection 
can be successfully managed medically, early surgical intervention is  still considered a first -line 
treatment for pleural infection in some regions around the wor ld 9,10. This approach has been 
justified on the basis of improved clinical outcome and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271473] .
11-15 
 Video- assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)  has been suggested as a surgical invasive 
approach to clear potentially infected material from the pleural space. In one small  randomized 
and another  non-randomized prospective trial comparing VATS with intercostal drainage plus 
intrapleural  streptokinase,  VATS was associated with decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271474].
16,[ADDRESS_330926], these two 
trials were under -powered studies  without appropriate sample size calculation. Second, VATS 
was co mpared to intrapleural streptokinase. The intrapleural activity of endogenous 
plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1) in the pathogenesis of pleural infection is important since 
this mediator not only directly inhibits streptokinase but has also been shown  to contribute to the 
severity of loculation and poor outcomes with intrapleural  fibrinolytic therapy .18-[ADDRESS_330927] shown that VATS is usually performed on a younger and less comorbid population (i.e. highly selected patients) , compared to the unselected population of patients  
(which are usually sicker, elderly and have multiple comorbidities)  with pleural infection seen in 
the fibrinolytic studies.
9,10, 11,21  Moreover, failure to respond to medical fibrinolytic therapy might 
3 
 necessitate  invasive surgical intervention, such as VATS , or even open thoracotomy , at a later 
stage of the pleur al infection where adequate clearance of the dense septations and thickening 
within and around the pleural cavity  is needed to reverse lung restriction and improve 
compliance. However, clinical outcomes are unpredictable, with some patients having no long-
term sequelae but others showing permanent impairment of lung function.  
 Medical thoracoscopy  (MT) is a minimally invasive procedure  that ca n be used to treat pleural 
infection through improving clearance by [CONTACT_271483]. MT can also be used in patients who are not fit for general anesthesia by [CONTACT_271484]. MT has shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of pleural 
infection in observational studies.
22-25 However, to date, there are no randomized controlled 
trials addressing the potential role of early MT versus fibrinolytic therapy in empyema and complicated pleural infection.  
 
Proposal:  
Specific Aim 1:   
To compare the efficacy of early medical thoracoscopy versus fibrinolytic therapy (tPA/DNase) in patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions or pleural empyema. 
Methods and Procedures:  
Study Design 
 
This prospective randomized trial will be conducted at UF Health Shands Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271475]. A large number 
of patients with pleural infection are treated at our institution , with a multidisciplinary team 
comprised of experienced interventional pulmonologists, chest radiologists and thoracic surgeons. We plan to enroll a total of 60 patients with pleural infection that will be randomized 
utilizing a computerized system  to either medical thoracoscopy  (thoracoscopy group) or 
fibrinolytic therapy  (fibrinolytic group). 
 
Patient Population 
4 
 Subjects (> 18 years of age) with either CPPE or empyema will be screened for inclusion. 
Screening logs recording reasons for non- trial entry will be kept.  
 
CPPE is defined as non- purulent effusion in a patient with clinical evidence of infection such as 
fever and/or elevated blood leukocyte count  and/or elevated CRP , with pleural fluid pH ≤ 7.2 
(measured by [CONTACT_41225]- gas analyzer) , or pleural fluid glucose < 60 mg/dl or  pleural fluid LDH 
>1000 IU/L26. Empyema is defined as pus within the pleural space and/or presence of bacteria 
on pleural fluid Gram stain or culture.   
 For patients to be considered for the trial they need to fulfill  one of the following criteria:  1) 
CPPE along with evidence of septated pleural effusion on pleural ultrasonography  and/or  chest  
CT scan 
27 (Figure 1) or 2) empyema.

(arrowhead)  
 Prescreening / Study exclusion criteria are  as follows :  
1) age <18 years;  
2) pregnancy   
3) inability to give informed written consent;  
4) previous  thoracic surgery or thrombolytic therapy for pleural infection;  
5) medical thoracoscopy cannot be performed within 48  hours ;  
Complex septated  
5 
 6) inability to tolerate procedure due to hemodynamic instability or severe 
hypoxemia;  
7) inability to correct coagulopathy ;  
8) presence of a homogeneously echogenic effusion on pleural US27 (Figure 2) . 
 
Figure 2. Thoracic ultrasound showing homogeneously echogenic loculated effusion 
 
Patients who agree to participate in the trial will sign an informed consent . Next, a ll patients will 
undergo diagnostic thoracentesis as per standard of care. In addition to standard of care testing on pleural fluid, an additional [ADDRESS_330928] of care.  
 Following diagnostic thoracentesis and confirmation of pleural infection, participants  will be 
randomly assigned to either  receive t horacoscopy ( treatment arm) or f ibrinolytic therapy ( control 
arm). (Figure 3) 
 
Pleural effusion will be defined as loculated if it (1) has a lobulated shape with a convex boarder 
or (2) it is compartmentalized or accumulated in a fissure or a non- dependent portion of the 
pleura.  On chest ultrasound the pleural effusion will be defined as loculated if it h as fibrin 
homogeneously 
echoegenic  
6 
 strands or septa floating inside the anechoic/hypoechoic pleural effusion(s) along with the 
presence of defined multiple pockets in the pleural cavity . 28 
Pain scores and general physical status will be assessed using a participant- completed 100- mm 
visual analog scale (VAS)  upon randomization, at 6 weeks  (via phone call)  and 12 weeks follow 
up. 
 
Study Protocol I- Thoracoscopy ( Treatment Arm)  
 
Patients will undergo medical thoracoscopy  (rigid or semi -rigid)  within 48 hours of 
randomization. A single port (with a maximum of 2 ports) will be placed and thoracoscopy w ill be 
performed under monitoring as per standard protocols, with the patient in a lateral decubitus 
position. The pleura will be carefully inspected through the thoracoscope under direct 
visuali zation.   Adhesiolysis will be attempted and pleural irrigation will be done. At the end of the 
procedure, a drain will be inserted and connected to an underwater seal with a negative 
pressure suction. As per standard of care, a  chest CT without contrast will be performed when 
chest tube drainage is < 75 mLs and if there was no evidence of significant pleural effusion 
(<200 ml), the catheter will be removed [ADDRESS_330929] dependent position.
29 Any need for 
additional drainage or administration of fibrinolytic  or surgery  will be considered treatment 
failure.  
 II-Fibrinolytic Therapy  (Control Arm)  
 A chest tube (14-French or less) will be inserted under ultrasonography into the most dependent 
area of the pleural effusion or into the largest loculation in patients with multi -loculated effusions.  
The dose of DNase (Pulmozyme, Genentech, [LOCATION_003]) will be  5 mg and the dose of t PA (Actilyse, 
Genentech, [LOCATION_003]) will be  10 mg, each in 50 ml of 0.9% NaCl. The tPA and DNase will not be 
mixed together in one syringe. Concurrent tPA and DNase will be administered intrapleurally 
through the chest tube followed by [CONTACT_271485]. The tube will then be clamped for [ADDRESS_330930] tube  drainage is < 75 m Ls and if there was no evidence of significant 
7 
 pleural effusion ( <200 ml), the catheter will be removed 29. Any need for additional drainage or 
more doses of fibrinolytic from the existing drainage over and above the 6 doses mentioned or 
surgery  will be considered treatment failure.  
 
Study Outcome  
Primary outcome measure : 
• Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271476], as defined as thoracoscopy in the 
treatment arm and first dose of fibrinolytic in the control arm  
 
Secondary outcome measures:  
 
• Number of days with chest  tube drainage 
• Total length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• Failure rate of assigned treatment necessitating intervention defined as any of 
the following:  
1-Surgical intervention (VATS, open thoracotomy)  in either  arm 
2-Need of additional chest tube and/or fibrinolytic therapy in the medical thoracoscopy 
arm due t o clinical non- responsiveness  
3-Need of additional chest tube in the fibrinolytic therapy arm due to clinical non-
responsiveness  
• Adverse events  
o Pleural bleeding defined as drop in serum hematocrit requiring blood 
transfusion or causing hemodynamic instabili ty 
o Significant pain requiring escalation of analgesia  
• In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 30- day mortality  
• Change in pleural fluid volume on chest CT scan from randomization (day 0) to 
prior to chest tube removal  measured by [CONTACT_271486]  (Mohammed)  blinded to treatment 
allocation using image J software . Volume of pleural effusion will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_271487] -of-care CT 
examination.  
• Infectious biomarker (CRP) from randomization (day 0), at removal  of chest tube 
and [ADDRESS_330931] of care  
• Total costs of each treatment modality  in each treatment site  
[ADDRESS_330932] -intervention hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271477] 2 days  between the two treatment 
arms would be clinically important.  
 This rationale was based on previous large VATS case series reported by [CONTACT_271488]
30 
in which the mean postoperative stay was 7.2  d ± 3.2 d versus 11.8 d±9.4 d from randomization 
to fibrinolytic therapy until discharge in the MIST2 trial9 and 10 d ± 1.[ADDRESS_330933] intrapleural 
treatment dose until discharge reported by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_271478].31 
 To demonstrate this difference with 5% significance and 80% power, a  minimum of 30 patient s 
will be needed in each study group.  Baseline characteristics w ill be compared between the two 
groups  using Chi square, t tests, and Mann- Whitney U tests as appropriate. All data w ill be 
analyzed according to the intention- to-treat principle. A p value of ≤ 0.[ADDRESS_330934] formed, and often a surgical VATS or 
thoracotomy under  general anesthesia becomes necessary. Therefore, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_271479]/CPPE . 
Human Subjects Will Be Used 
The research team will explain the details about the study  to the patient . This discussion will 
also serve to answer any questions that the subject may have. Potential risks will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_271489]. The subject will have an option to opt out of the 
[ADDRESS_330935] identification for any other purpose. The protected health information (PHI) will not  be reused or disclosed to any other 
person or entity except for other research for which the use of the PHI would be permitted under the Privacy Rule.   
After enrollment, a number will be assigned to the subject. This number will be used for all study documents to maintain the privacy of the subject. The subjects will have the phone numbers of the study team members for any questions or concerns that might arise throughout the study period.  
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this 
study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_271490].  The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be 
obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.  
 
No Animals or Biohazardous Materials Will Be Used.  
Risks and Benefits If successful, this study may improve standard of care treatment for pleural infection by 
[CONTACT_271491]- of-care procedures produces superior clinical outcomes 
including decreased length of stay and decreased need for adjuvant  / subsequent treatments 
following initial treatment for pleural infection. 
Risk associated with thoracentesis:  
a. Pain during placement (minor and controlled with anesthesia)  
b. Bleeding. During insertion of the needle, a blood vessel in the skin or chest wall 
may be accidentally nicked. Bleeding is usually minor and stops on its own. Sometimes, 
[ADDRESS_330936] tube or surgery.  
 Collapsed lung.  When the needle is being placed, it may puncture the lung. This 
hole may seal quickly on its own. If the hole does not seal over, air can leak out and build up around the lung. This build- up of air  can cause part or all of the lung on that side 
to collapse (pneumothorax). If this happens, the doctor can place a chest tube between the ribs into the chest to remove the air that is leaking from the lung  
 
Risks associated with sedation:  
a. Drowsiness, slurred speech, tremor, fatigue, and low blood pressure, increase 
carbon dioxide in your blood, slowing of the heart rate, anxiety, confusion, dizziness 
and shivering  
b. .Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. Trained medical professionals with extensive 
experience and expertise will administer these medications and will be responsible for monitoring the participant  during the course of the procedure.
 
 
Risks associated with t horacoscopy : 
a. Chest pain (5%). The nerves between the ribs are bruised after the procedure, 
which can cause some persistent pain.  
b. Air leak from lung (1- 5%). A small hole develops in the lung. This means the 
chest tube has to stay in longer.  
c. Bleeding (< 1%). Usually it is minor and settles quickly. Bleeding is more 
common if you have been taking blood thinning drugs.  
d. Heart problems (< 1%). A brief minor strain may be put on the heart. This can 
cause abnormal beating of the heart, fluid to accumulate in the lungs, a heart attack, or the heart may stop beating. 
 
e. Low oxygen levels (< 1%). Participants will  be administered oxygen if needed.  
f. Death(< 1%) as a result of this procedure is  uncommon.  
 
Risks associated with chest tubes: 
11 
 a. Pain during placement —Discomfort often occurs as the chest tube is inserted. 
Doctors try to lessen any pain or discomfort by [CONTACT_91959] a local numbing medicine. The 
discomfort usually decreases once the tube is in place.  
b. Bleeding (<5%) —During insertion of the tube, a blood vessel in the skin or chest 
wall may be accidentally nicked. Bleeding is usually minor and stops on its own. R arely, 
bleeding can occur into or around the lung and may require surgery. Usually bleeding can just be watched with the chest tube in place.  
c. Infection (< 5%) —Bacteria can enter around the tube and cause an infection 
around the lung. The longer the chest tube stays in the chest, the greater the risk for 
infection. The risk of infection is decreased by [CONTACT_271492].  
 
Risks associated with fibrinolytic therapy:  
a. Pain (15%) -While the medications are in the pleural space, participants may  feel 
some discomfort. Usually such pain can be relieved by [CONTACT_271493].  
b. Bleeding (5%) -While medications are in the pleural space, participants may  
experience bleeding inside the pleural space. Usually, it resolves with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_271480]. Rarely, blood transfusion might be need or require surgery.  
 
Privacy  risks: As with any study, there is a risk that personal health information, collected 
during the course of research, may be disclosed. The research team will to everything within their power to mitigate and minimize this risk. The data collected both written and electronic will be held securely in a locked cabinet and secure server behind the UF Health firewall respectively. Only the study individual will be contact[CONTACT_271494]’ administered in the privacy of a secluded clinic room. The data collected will be restricted to only the minimum amount necessary to accomplish the aim of the study.  
 
Risks associated with p sychological stress:  Participants may feel embarrassed or 
uncomfortable responded to questions. Participants will be informed that they may refuse to 
answer any of the questions and may take a break at any time during the study. Participants are 
also free to withdraw from  the study at any time.

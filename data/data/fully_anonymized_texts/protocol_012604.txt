I. Study Design 
 
This is a randomized, safety evaluator-blind, three-treatment, crossover, fasting study in healthy 
adults (18  - 50 years of age). The design includes a Screening Visit, three Dosing Visits and a 
follow-up phone evaluation. All study subjects must be properly consented, and screened against 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to randomization.   
 
1) Screening Visit (3 – 7 days before Visit-1 ):  
Prospective subjects will sign informed consent and be assigned a screening ID,  EIS- mm, 
where EI represents “E 004-CL-I Study”, S stands for screening, and mm is the screening 
sequential number. Subjects will be screened per inclusion/exclusion criteria. The

Confidential    following screening activities will be conducted: (i) physical examination (PE), (ii) 
measurements of vital signs, (i ii) ECG, (iv)  urinalysis (UA), (v) urine drug screen, (vi) 
alcohol screen ( urine or breathalyzer), (vii) urine or serum pregnancy test ( all female 
subjects), and (viii) fasting (≥ 8 hours) blood tests [comprehensive metabolic panel, 
complete blood count (CBC) with differentials, thyroid function tests, HIV, hepatitis B and 
C test s]. 
 
The subject’s recent medication history will include a review for any use of medicines as 
listed in the prohibited drug list, Appendix II I. Qualified subjects will be scheduled for 
Dosing Visit.  
 
Per FDA guidance for Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI), each subject will be trained on the 
correct self -administration of MDI using placebo, a MDI training unit that contains no 
active drug, to assure a relatively consistent inspi[INVESTIGATOR_529242] n [1]. 
A video on how to use the MDI will be provided at each training session at Screening and 
dosing visit s. Subjects will be retr ained on the use of the MDI at each dosing visit . 
Vitalograph AIM™ (Aerosol Inhalation Monitor) w ill be used to monitor the duration of the 
inhalation during the training at Screening and the dosing visit. In order to be enrolled into 
the study, subject must demonstrate proficiency in the use of MDI after training .  
 
2) Dosing Visit s (separ ated by 2 to 7  day between the t hree visits ):   
Subject qualification will be confirmed at the beginning of the Dosing Visit . After satisfying 
the enrollment criteria, each subject will be assigned a unique study subject ID as EIPK-nn, 
where nn is the sequential number based on the order of enrollment.   
 
At each dosing visit, subjects will either self-administer the MDI inhaler provided 
(Primatene Mist for Treatment -A, or ProAir HFA for Treatment -C), or receive an IM 
injection ( 0.30mg Epi[INVESTIGATOR_529243] -B)  
 
Fasting (≥ 10 hours) is required prior to study drug dosing. Meals will be served after the [ADDRESS_687666]-dose PK sampling point and after completion of End -of-Study  (EOS) blood draw.  
 
Record concomitant drugs or ongoing medications  since the Screening  Visit, and ensure that 
all prohibited drugs washout have been met.  
 
One (1) baseline and twenty -five (25) serial post -dose PK blood samples will be collected 
for PK analysis .

Table A.  Study Arms and Treatments 
 
 
 
Subjects will be retrained on the use of the MDI at each Dosing Visit . Vitalograph AIM™ 
(Aerosol Inhalation Monitor) will be used to monitor and measure the duration of the inhalation 
during the training at Screening and prior to dosing. 
 
Each MDI must be primed at the study site prior to the first use by [CONTACT_291246] [ADDRESS_687672] sprays (E004 
for Treatment-A), or [ADDRESS_687673] sprays (ProAir for Treatment-C) into the air away from the face, 
shake the inhaler well before each spray. Priming will be performed in an area that is well 
ventilated (preferably a fume hood, or an open space), and physically separated from the study 
evaluation area.  
 
Subjects will self-administer two  (2) inhalations (within 30 seconds interval between each 
inhalation) of E004 for Treatment-A, or two (2) inhalation of ProAir for Treatment-C. The study 
drug administration process will also be recorded, and the video will be used to investigate 
apparent irregularities. Time of the start of each inhalation will be recorded. The used MDI 
inhaler will be collected at the end of each Dosing Visit.  
 
IM injection (0.30mg of epi[INVESTIGATOR_529245] 0.30 mL) for Treatment-B will be given on the 
thigh. Subjects will be lying down in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. The 0. [ADDRESS_687674] of the thigh (vastus 
lateralis site).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_156705] (Treatment B) will be administered as follows [2]:

Confidential    One (1) pre -dose baseline sample will be collected within [ADDRESS_687678] inhalation  of the MDI , or at the completion of IM 
administration . 
 
 
2) Sampling Procedure   
A catheter will be inserted into one of the antecubital region veins for blood sampling. 
Alternatively, if there is a clot in the catheter, collection from a vein of the hand or forearm for 
easier access or via venipuncture is also acceptable. After each b lood sample collection, a 
catheter flush will be performed to avoid catheter clot formation and prevent interference 
between samples.   
 
At each sampling point, the first 1 mL of blood will be discarded for waste (utilizing a disposable 
tube), and blood samples (~ 5 mL) will be collected in ice -chilled potassium -EDTA sample tubes, 
mixed well immediately following collection, kept on ice or refrigerated and centrifuged within 
20 minutes of collection. All blood samples will be centrifuged at 4°C, 2,000 -3,000 g for 20 
minutes for plasma isolation. Isolated plasma will be distributed into two (2) aliquots, 
approximately 1.[ADDRESS_687679] aliquot and the remainder in the second aliquot.  The plasma 
sample vials will be frozen immediately on dry ice and then stor ed (within 60 minutes following 
plasm a separation) in a freezer at -20C or lower until analysis.  
 
 
3) PK Sample ID   
 
The sample ID for PK blood  samples (before centrifugation) is defined as:    
      
                                                            “EIPK-nn-V-XX” 
 
where EIPK-nn is the subject ID , V is the dosing visit code, V=1 to 3, and XX is the two -digit 
time-point sequential number of the sample: 01, 02, 03, … 26 as listed in Table B . 
 
The sample ID for PK plasma  samples (after centrifugation) is defined as “ EIPK-nn-V-XX-k” 
and k is the aliquot number (A or B). The PK plasma sample ID labels, with the size of 
1/2”×1¾” (Avery label 5667), should be printed in blue font as demonstrated bel ow:

established that orally inhaled epi[INVESTIGATOR_529251] a minimal systemic exposure  [3], 
due partly to its mode of pulmonary delivery and partly to its post-absorption degradation by 
[CONTACT_503412]-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidases (MAO) in the 
gastrointestinal tract and liver [4]. In addition, its local α -adrenergic vasoconstrictive actions 
in the lungs have been postulated to further reduce its systemic exposure after inhalation.  
 
Primatene® MIST (E004) is a epi[INVESTIGATOR_529252], supplied in metered dose 
inhaler (MDI),  which allows 0.125 mg per spray of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. Primatene® MIST is the

Although systemically administered epi[INVESTIGATOR_529254] α - and β -adrenergic receptors 
non-selectively, the inhaled epi[INVESTIGATOR_529255] β2 -adrenergic receptors which are the predominant type in  the bronchial smooth muscles 
[3]. This leads to the activation of adenylcyclase, and to an increase in  the intracellular 
concentration of cyclic -3’,5’ -adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase of cAMP in 
turn leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which then inhibits the phosphorylation of 
myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrati ons, and results in relaxation of 
smooth muscles of all airways. Increased cAMP concentrations are also associated with the 
inhibition of release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells in the airway. These events 
lead to dilation of the tracheal bronchi al lumens with substantial increase in air passage. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_529256] a functional antagonist to relax the airway smooth muscles irrespective 
of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against most if not all bronchoconstrictor 
challenges.  
 
Similarly, Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscle of all airways, from the trachea to the 
terminal bronchioles.

subsequent 30 inhalations (a dose of 4.8 mg epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), the epi[INVESTIGATOR_529263] a 
peak of 4.22 (1.93) n mol/L (i.e., 772 pg/ml). The plasma epi[INVESTIGATOR_529264] 20 
min after 3 0 inhalations of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] [2]. 
 
Overall systemic sympathomimetic effects are minimized due to a very low systemic 
exposure (~5% bioavaila bility) after oral inhalation [3]. 
 
The systemic levels of albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses. The terminal 
plasma half -life of albuterol delivered by [CONTACT_529300] 6 hours.  
 
Information fro m published literature suggests that the primary enzyme responsible for the 
metabolism of albuterol in humans is SULTIA3 (sulfotransferase). The primary route of 
elimination of albuterol is through renal excretion (80% to 100%) of either the parent 
compoun d or the primary metabolite. Less than 20% of the drug is detected in the feces.  
 
Pharmacodynamics:  
 
In a double -blind, randomized, two -period crossover study with mild -to-moderate asthma 
patients, the FEV 1 measurements in subjects receiving inhalation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_529265] r eceiving placebo inhalations . Clinically significant improvement in FEV 1, defined as 
an increase of ≥15% above  baseline, has been observed . The results also sh owed that  at 15 
seconds after one inhalation, 11 of the 24 subjects receiving epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], but only 1 of the 23 
subjects receiving placebo, exhibited significant imp rovement in FEV 1 (P < 0.004) . Mean 
volume (and %) increments (± 1 SEM) in FEV 1 at 15 sec after 1 inhalation were 390±60 ml 
(16.8±2.6%) after epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and -120±7 ml ( -6.1±2.9%) after placebo (P < 0.0001). Mean 
peak volume (and %) increments in FEV 1 were 800±80 ml (34.5±3.3%) after epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and 
180±60 ml (6.9±2.5%) after place bo (P<0.0001). The same study also demonstrated that the 
mean time (±SD) to peak increase in FEV1 (T max) was 7.5±7.8 min. With 2 inhalations 
administered 1 min apart, average T max was less than 10 min [5].

fully depress the top of the metal canister , and hold it for at leas t one second 
before releasing . 
(3) Critical Timing : Subject begins a slow and deep inhalation before pressing the 
inhaler . A slight delay in the sequence can result in deposition of inhaled drugs on 
the back of the throat and tongue.  
(4) Deep inhalation as  long as possible : After pressing the inhaler, subject should 
continue to inhale slowly and deeply for as long as possible (at least 3 -5 seconds, 
refer to the  training video). Keep tongue away from the opening of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  
(5) After deep inhalation, hold the breath for approximately  10 seconds  (5- 10 seconds) 
[6] to allow deposition of drug particles into the lower level of the lung.  
 
4.5.3.  Detailed MDI Dosing Procedure  
 
(1) The designated study site personnel  will verify if the canister is fully inserted into 
the actuator.  
(2) The designated study site personnel  will remove the cap from the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_529283], and check the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_529284];  
(3) Subjects will  first shake and spray into the air one time  to mix the medicine.  
(4) Subjects will exhale deeply through the mouth and empty  the lungs as completely as 
possible by [CONTACT_529307] (exhalation must be deep and slow, similar to the deep 
inhalation step);  
(5) Immediately after the full exhalation, subjects wi ll hold the inhaler with the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_280821], then places the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_529285], with lips sealed 
around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959];  
(6) While inhaling, subjects will fully depress the top of the canister with an index 
finger. Subjects should  keep inhaling  deeply and slowly for as long as possible (at 
least  3 -5 seconds)  through the mouth;  
(7) After breathing in fully, remove the inhaler from the mouth, subjects keep the mouth 
closed, hold the breath for approximately 10 seconds  (5- 10 seconds)  [6]; 
(8) Subjects will exhale slowly through the nose (keep lips nearly closed);  and 
(9) Repeat the above (1) to (7) steps for the second inhalation. The time interval 
between  each actuation will be within [ADDRESS_687706] , Epi[INVESTIGATOR_529239] (E004)                                          Version 1. 1 (11/ 08 /2019)

Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation source document page.  
 
7.2. Adverse Events  
 
The Investigator will be required to provide the sponsor with any information concerning any 
findings that suggest any adverse event pertinent to the investigation.  
 
The study may be stopped at any time due to safety concerns. Subject safety will be 
constantly  monitored throughout the study. However, if and when a significant safety 
concern arises, such as occurrence of serious and unexpected adverse drug events that are 
considered associated with the study drug(s) per regulatory guidelines and SOP, the study 
may be discontinued and safety will be reviewed.   
 
Any such safety analysis will be presented and discussed in the final study report.  
 
7.2.1.  Types of Adverse Events  
  
The term “adverse event” could include any of the following events that arise, or increase 
in severity and/or frequency, during the course of the study:  
a) Any signs or symptoms whether thought to be related or unrelated to the condition 
under study.  
b) Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality.  
c) Any physical abnormality detected.  
 
These data will be recorded on the appropriate case report forms, including “Adverse Event 
Form”, regardless of whether they are thought to be associated with the study or the drug 
under investigation. Per FDA definition, “associated with the use of the drug” means t hat 
“there is a reasonable possibility that the experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641]”.  
 
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is 
possible, probable, or very likely according to definitions specified in  the AE reporting 
SOP and the CRF for adverse event.

Signs or symptoms will be graded by [CONTACT_57746], moderate or severe 
according to the following definitions:  
 
Severity    Definition  
Mild                Causing no limitation of usual activities  
Moderate  Causing some limitation of usual activities  
Severe       Causing inability to carry out usual activities  
 
When a subject experiences any significant adverse event or laboratory abnormality, th e 
event must be followed based on good clinical practice until it becomes resolved or stable.  
 
7.2.2.  Definition of Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events  
 
According to the FDA guidelines, a serious adverse event will refer to any adverse drug 
experience occurring  at any dose results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
a) Cancer [6]. 
b) Death.  
c) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
e) A persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
f) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
g) Other important medical events, while not resulting in death, being life -threatening, 
or requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may still be considered as serious adverse events when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.   
 
An unexpected event is any adverse experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the  approved labeling.  “Unexpected”, th us refers to an adverse drug 
experience that has not been previously observed rather than from the perspective of such 
experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical 
product.  
 
Expected adverse events of Primatene  Mist include: headache, nausea , vomiting, 
nervousness, dizziness, shaking (tremor), trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , stomach upset, sweating, dry 
mouth, bad taste, cough, sore throat, difficult or painful urination , fast heartbeat, weakness, 
high blood pressure, loss of  appetite, loss of skin color, or dry throat.  Severe adverse 
reactions are very rare.

 7.2.3.  Obligations of AE Reporting to Sites, FDA and IRB  
 
Sponsor Reporting to Investigator:  Sponsor shall promptly notify the Investigators of 
any material discoveries made  during monitoring of the sites which could affect the safety 
of participants or influence the conduct of the study.  
 
Investigator Reporting to Sponsor:   Any serious events, whether or not unexpected or 
considered to be associated with the use of the drug,  must be communicated by [CONTACT_529315], Inc. immediately upon discovery of the event. 
The Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will then advise the Investigator regarding the 
nature of any further information or documentation t hat is required.  
 
Sponsor/Investigator Reporting to FDA:  It is required to report to FDA any serious 
adverse event observed during the conduct of the study, regardless of whether the event is 
considered drug related.  
 
Each notification shall be made as soon as possible and in no event later than 15 calendar 
days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Each notification shall be 
submitted via the FDA Safety Reporting Portal (SRP). The FDA must be notified via 
telephone of the Sponsor’s ini tial notification of any fatal or life -threatening experiences 
associated with the use of the drug as soon as possible but in no event later than seven (7) 
calendar days.  
 
Sponsor/Investigator Reporting to IRB:   All serious adverse events or an unanticipat ed 
problem must be reported to the appropriate IRB/Ethics Committee promptly.  
 
1. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting Policy:  
An adverse event is considered serious  if it results in any of the outcomes listed in 
Section 7.2.2 .  Study sites are required to report any SAE to the IRB, regardless of 
whether the event is considered drug related. The specific reporting policy defined by 
[CONTACT_529316]. 
 
Note: IRB does not require the event to be unexpected. The IRB feels that this category 
is too subjective, and can change over time, to be a criterion for deciding whether the 
event is reportable or not.  
 
2. Unanticipated Problem/Event Report Form:  
In order for the event to be reportable to the IRB, it must meet all of the following 
criteria:  
 The event is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the 
research procedures described in the study Protocol and/or Informed Consent

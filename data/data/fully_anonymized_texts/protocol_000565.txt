 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Neuroendocrine malignancies refer to a diverse group of diseases that are generally rare 
however, the ir incidences are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_88150].  Among these, p ancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumors (PNETs, islet cell tumor, islet cell carcinoma, or pancreatic carcinoid ) account for up to 
5% of all pancreatic malignancies.  Functional PNET tumors make extra amounts of hormones (e.g. gastrin, insulin, and glucag on) and cause symptoms.  Non-functional PNETs do not make 
extra amounts of hormones, and the symptoms are caused by [CONTACT_585115].  The majority of the non-functional tumors are malignant.  
Gastrointestinal (GI)  carcinoids are well -differentiated  endocrine neoplasms that consist of a 
diverse group of tumors arising from cells of the diffuse endocrine system with in the GI tract .  
These tumors are generally slow -growing and can be present throughout the GI tract .  All GI 
carcinoids share common pathologic features that characterize them as well -differentiated 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) ( Levy and Sobin. 2007).   The World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification of GI NETs is clinically and prognostically useful for newly diagnosed 
patients with GI NETs because it accounts for specific biological behavior according to location 
and tumor differentiation.  The specific biological behavior of a particular tumor type varies according to the cell of origin ( Capella et al. 1995 ; Solcia et al. 2000).  
1.2 Treatment for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor s (PNET) and gastrointestinal 
carcinoid tumors  
Standard therapy for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNET) and gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors generally consists of chemotherapy combinations with streptozocin and either flurouracil 
or adriamycin, which are not very effective ( Cheng  and Saltz, 1999; McCollum et al. 2004).  
Neuroendocrine tumors are characterized by [CONTACT_585116] -angiogenic factors and growth factors and growth receptors (PDGFR), fibroblast 
growth factor receptor (FGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), insulin- like growth  
factor  1 (IGF -1) receptor, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR).  One of the major signalling 
pathways implicated in driving these tumors is the PI3K -AKT -mTOR pathway ( Bergers  et al. 
1999; Phan  et al. 2006; Chaudhry  et al. 1992; Wulbrand et al. 2000; Nilsson  et al. 1992; 
Papouchado et al. 2005; Vignot et al. 2005).  This com plex molecular signature [INVESTIGATOR_129128] a 
randomized phase III trial of sunitinib, a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ver sus best 
supportive care in patients with advanced PNET.  Results of t his trial reported an improvement 
in response rate (9.3% vs. 0%, p=0.0066) and progression- free survival ( PFS, 11.4 vs. 5.5 
months, p=0.0001, hazard ratio  0.418 [0.263, 0.662]) with sunitinib in patients with advanced, 
well-differentiated PNETs ( Niccoli  et al. 2010; Raymond et al. 2011).  Based on this 
information, sunitinib was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the 
treatment of progressive, well -differentiated PNET in patients with unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic diseases.  The RADIANT -[ADDRESS_769297] supportive care ( Yao et al. 2011, Afinitor (everolimus) PI 2102).  Everolimus

 treatment resulted in an improved PFS  (11.0 vs. 4.6 months, HR 0.35 [0.27, 0.45] and response 
rate (5 vs. 2%).   Everolimus has also been FDA approved for this patient population.  
Clinical trial data for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors are still emerging .  
Octreotide, which binds to somatostatin receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in most 
neuroendocrine tumors, has been shown to control symptoms and delay tumor growth in these patients ( Leong et al. 2002; Imtiaz et al. 2000 ).  A recent randomized phase III s tudy with 
octreotide LAR vs. placebo for patients with metastatic neuroendocrine cancers (PROMID study) showed an improvement in median time to progression ( Rinke et al. 2009).   In the 
randomized, double- blind, multicenter trial o f everolimus plus octreotide and best supportive 
care (BSC) vs. placebo  plus octreotide and best supportive care for patients with advanced 
carcinoid tumors (RADIANT-2) , a small improvement in progression- free survival  was seen for 
patients treated with ev erolimus (16.4 ver sus. 11.3 months, HR 0.77, [0.59, 1.0]) ( Pavel et al. 
2011).   Response rate was 2% for both treatment groups.  The use of bevacizumab for these 
patients is also under evaluation in a large randomized Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)
 
study whose results are anticipated shortly. 
1.3 Carfilzomib  
Carfilzomib (KYPROLIS, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, is 
currently approved by [CONTACT_585117][INVESTIGATOR_014], including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent and have demonstrated disease progression on or within [ADDRESS_769298] therapy (Siegel  et al. 2012; Herndon et al. 2013; Kyprolis ® (carfilzomib)  PI 2012 ).  This approval was 
accelerated based on response rate.  In addition, carfilzomib has been studied in other cancer 
types such as  Waldenstrom’s m acroglobulinemia , non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, mantle cell 
lymphoma, and a variety of solid tumors. C arfilzomib has  a favorable safety profile according to 
the reported clinical studies.  
Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone-based inhibitor of the chymotrypsin like activity of th e 
20S proteasome. It is structurally and mechanistically different from the dipeptide boronic acid 
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.  C arfilzomib also  demonstrated  less off -target activity  
compared to bortezomib when measured against a broad panel of protea ses including metallo -
proteases,  aspartyl -proteases, and serine proteases .  This selectivity of carfilzomib may 
contribute to the reduced myelosuppression and neuropathy observed in preclinical studies when compared with  bortezomib.

2007). Treatment of several hematologic tumor cell lines with carfilzomib for as little as [ADDRESS_769300] acquired resistance to bortezomib ( Suzuki et al. 2011; Kuhn 
et al. 2007). Preclinical studies  were done in rats and monkeys where carfilzomib was

 administered intravenously (IV) for [ADDRESS_769301] period of 9 days for 2 
cycles , showing a proteasome inhibition of more than 80% ( Yang  et al. 2011).   
However, bolus administration of carfilzomib has produced several adverse effects in rats and/or monkeys including cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic and hematopoietic toxicities, which were reduced with a longer infusion time  (Herndon et al. 2013).  Car filzomib 
also caused embryofetal toxicities in rats and rabbits, but has not shown any signs of teratogenicity. For this reason, pregnancy category D has been assigned for this agent , as the 
potential benefits in pregnant patient populations outweigh the potential harm to the fetus. 
Lastly, c arfilzomib has been administered to rats and monkeys for 6 and 9 months, respectively , 
(once daily dosing on Days 1 and 2 for three  consecutive w eeks on a 28- day cycle) , and was 
found to be well tolerated at the doses administered, showing more than 80% proteasome 
inhibition, with no behavioral changes or histological evidence of peripheral neuropathy and no neutropenia.  For details refer to the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB ).  In contrast, rats and monkeys 
treated with bortezomib in chronic toxicity studies  demonstrated reduced motor activity, 
convulsions, tremors, and hind- limb paralysis  accompanied by [CONTACT_585118], as well as significant  neutropenia. 
1.3.2 Clinical Experience 
In the single -arm, multicenter trial of 266 multiple myeloma patients, carfilzomib produced an 
overall response rate (ORR) of 22.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] :18, 28.5) with a median 
duration of response of 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.2).  In this and other studies, carfilzomib was well tolerated and did not seem to cause clinically meaningful peripheral neuropathy.  The most commonly reported adverse events (AEs)  were fatigue, anemia, nausea, thro mbocytopenia, 
dyspnea, diarrhea, and pyrexia.  Subsequent studies confirming the benefit of carfilzomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma are ongoing.  
In a clinical  study, the pharmacokinetics and safety of carfilzomib were evaluated in patients 
with normal  renal function vs. those with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment , as well 
as in patients on chronic dialysis, treated with carfilzomib doses of 15 mg/m
2 during cycle 1, 20 
mg/m2 during cycle 2, and 27 mg/m2 for cycles 3 and  beyond ( Badros  et al. 2013).   
Pharmacokinetics data available for the 15  and 20 mg/m2  dose indicated that the C max and AUC 
of carfilzomib  were similar across all renal function categories following  carfilzomib doses of 15 
and 20 mg/m2.  Moreover, t he overall  safety profile was similar in patients in all renal function 
categories during mean treatment duration  of 5.[ADDRESS_769302] ubiquitinated via the 
ubiquitin conjugation system.  Ubiquitinated proteins are cleaved within the proteasome by [CONTACT_585119] N -terminal threonine protease activities: a chymotrypsin -like activity, a 
trypsin -like activity, and a caspase- like activity.

antiangiogenic, and antitumor effects across multiple tumor models ( Boccadoro et al. 2005).   
Preclinical data showed antitumor activity of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in the PC -12 
neuroendocrine cell line ( Fenteany and Schreiber. 1996) .  A subsequent phase II study of 
bortezomib in 16 patients with PNET or carcinoid resulted in no objective responses ( Shah et al. 
2004) .  However, patient numbers were small and there was heterogeneity in tumor type as well 
as tumor marker status of the patients.   
Carfilzomib is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor that showed activity in patients who have 
failed to respond to  bortezomib treatment  and it exhibits antiproliferative and proapoptotic 
activity in solid and hematologic tumor cells in vitro .  We propose this phase II study to evaluate 
carfilzomib for patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers.

5. STUDY DESIGN  
This Phase II open-label, non-randomized clinical study will be conducted by [CONTACT_114363] s ites 
in the Sarah Cannon Research Institute network.  This study will evaluate the use of carfilzomib for patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.  For the purpose of this study, patients will receive treatment by [CONTACT_12781] 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each  cycle.  
Cycles are 28 days in length.  Patients will receive 20 mg/m
2 on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1.  
Thereafter, patients will receive 56 mg/m2 on Days 8, 9, 15 and 16.  Starting from Cycle 2 
patients will receive 56 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16.  Patients  will be evaluated for 
response to treatment every 3 cycles ; responding and/or stable patients will continue treatment, 
with re -evaluations every [ADDRESS_769323] v 1.1criteria (see Appendix E ).   
The doses to be administered on specific treatment days are outlined in the table below.  Patients will receive dexamethasone (4 mg  for 20 mg/m
2 and 8 mg for 56 mg/m2) prior to receiving all 
carfilzomib doses in Cycle 1 and as needed throughout the study to reduce the severity of infusion reactions associated with carfilzomib.  The primary endpoints for this study are ORR 
and PFS.  
The planned enrollment for this study is 6 2 patients.

Pre-treatment  Hydration and Fluid Monitoring  
Intravenous (IV) hydration will be given immediately prior to each dose of carfilzomib during 
Cycle  1; 250 to 500 mL normal saline or other appropriate IV fluid should be given to reduce the 
risk of renal toxicity and of tumor l ysis s yndrome (TLS) .  An additional 250 mL to 500 mL of IV 
fluids will be given as needed following carfilzomib  administration.   If lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) or uric acid is elevated (and/or in patient s considered still at risk for TLS) at Cycle [ADDRESS_769325] urine output (e.g., ≥ 2 L/day).  Patient s 
should be monitored periodically during this period for evidence of fluid overload.  After Cycle 2, patients will be hydrated at the Investigator’s discretion.   
If the patient has a dedicated line for carfilzomib administration, the line must be flushed with a 
minimum of 20 mL of normal saline prior to and after drug administration.  
Pre-treatment  Dexamethasone 
Dexamethasone ( 4 mg for the 20 mg/m
2 carfilzomib dose and 8 mg for the 56 mg/m2 carfilzomib 
dose) PO/IV will be administered prior to all carfilzomib doses during the first cycle  and as 
needed in Cycle 2 and beyond.  If treatment -related fever, rigors, chills, and/or dyspnea are 
observed post any dose of carfilzomib after dexamethasone has been discontinued, dexamethasone ( 8 mg PO/IV) should be re-started and administered prior to subsequent doses.

Patients will continue on treatment until progression as defined in Appendix E  or intolerance to 
side effects . 
5.3 Concomitant Medications  
Carfilzomib is primarily metabolized via peptidase and  epoxide hydrolase activities, therefore 
the pharmacokinetics ( PK) profile of carfilzomib should not be affected by [CONTACT_585121] P450 (CYP) inhibitors and inducers. Carfilzomib is not expected to influence exposure of other drugs. However, p atients will be instructed not to take any 
additional medications during the course of the study without prior consultation with the research team.  At each visit, the patient will be asked about any new medications he is taking or has taken after the start of the study drug.

Premedication with anti- emetics should be given according t o institutional practice.  
Medications may be administered for maintenance of existing conditions prior to study 
enrollment, or fo r a new condition that develops while on study, including but not limited to the 
following: 
• Allopurinol (or other approved uric acid-lowering agent) in patient s at high risk for TLS 
due to high tumor burden may be prescribed at the investigator’s discretion. 
• Prophylactic antiviral therapy (e.g., valacyclovir) per institutional standard practice is strongly recommended for patients at increased risk of herpes zoster. 
• Patients may receive antiemetics and antidiarrheal agents as necessary.  
• Myeloid growth factors (e.g., granulocyte -colony stimulating factor [G -CSF]) may be 
used if neutropenia occurs in accordance with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guidelines ( Smith et al. 2006), but should not be given prophylactically.

Infusion reactions (e.g., rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, bronchospasm, and hypotension) can 
occur with the agent used in this study.  To identify the grade of a reaction, refer to the list below adap ted from the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions section of the NCI 
CTCAE v 4.03: 
• Grade 1:  Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2:  Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but responds promptly 
to symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids 
indicated for ≤24 hours).  
• Grade 3:  Prolonged (e.g., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_585108]/or brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138].  
Note:  any infusion that is interrupted and not resumed within the visit will 
be considered a Grade 3 reaction.  
• Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Minor symptoms such as flushing, skin reactions, dyspnoea, lower back pain, hypotension, or 
tachycardia may require temporary interruption of the infusion.  However, severe reactions, such as hypotension requiring treatment, dyspnoea requiring bronchodilators, angioedema or generalized urticaria may require immediate treatment discontinuation and aggressive symptomatic therapy.  Patients who experience a severe reaction should not be re- challenged.

Please contact [CONTACT_171800]. 
9. RESPONSE EVALUATIONS  AND MEASUREMENTS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (see Appendix E ).  Lesions are either measurable or non -
measurable according to the criteria.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Statistical Design  
This is a multicenter, Phase II study of c arfilzomib for the t reatment of patients with advanced 
neuroendocrine c ancers .  
Demographic data and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized using appropriate 
descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation or percentages and frequency counts). 
The primary endpoint, O RR, will be determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria .  The median and 
25% and 75% percentiles for PFS will be summarized with associated 95% CI, and the 
distribution of PFS will b e presented graphically using the Kaplan -Meier approach .  Progression -
free survival will be evaluated six and [ADDRESS_769337] patient is enrolled on the trial.  10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
This study will enroll up to 62 patients.   Simon’s optimal two -stage design (Simon, 1989) will be 
used for go/no go decision making.  The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.05 will be 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STUDY DRUG (S): CARFILZOMIB    SCRI INNOVATIONS  STUDY NUMBER : GI 195 
AMENDMENT  2 DATE :  [ADDRESS_769338] 6 responses are 
observed in 56 patients.  This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 80% when the true response rate is 0.15.  
The sample size will be increased by 10% to an accrual of 62 
patients, to account for potential non-evaluability.   
 
10.3 Analysis Population 
The following analysis populations will be used: 
• The Full A nalysis Set (FAS) will consist of all enrolled patients who receive at least one 
full or partial dose of study group and who have measurable disease at baseline. 
• The Evaluable Population will consist of the subset of the FAS who receive at least 2 full 
cycles of study drug and who no major protocol violations or deviations. 
• The Safety Population is defined as all patients who have received at least one full or 
partial dose of study treatment and for whom post baseline safety assessments are 
available.   
10.[ADDRESS_769339] deviations and ranges for all continuous measures will be tabulated and reported.  Percentages and frequencies for all categorical measures will also be presented.  For time to event outcomes, the median and 25% and 75% percentiles will be summarized with associated 95% confidence intervals.  All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS 9.1 or higher.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized.  Data to be tabulated will include demographic features such as age, sex and race, as well as disease- specific 
characteristics.  
The number and percentages of patients enrolled, treated, completing the treatment/study and 
withdrawn from treatment/study for any reasons will be summarized.  
10.4.1 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy analyses will be reported for FAS population.  Additionally, the ORR, Clinical Benefit 
Rate ( CBR ), and PFS will be summarized for the Evaluable Population.  The following outcomes 
will be used to evaluate the clinical benefit of the study treatment: 
• Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed 
complete response ( CR) or partial response (PR (i.e. [ADDRESS_769340] 4 weeks apart ) 
according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
 
• Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR or stable 
disease ( SD) (≥ 6 cycles) according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.

classed as not evaluable (NE) and considered as non -responders. 
 
• Progression-free Survival (PFS ) is defined as the time from the firs t day of study drug 
administration (Day 1) to disease progression as defined by [CONTACT_393] v1.[ADDRESS_769342] tumor assessment.  
 
For ORR and CBR, the estimates and the associated 95% CI  based on the Clopper- Pearson 
method will be calculated.  For PFS, Kaplan- Meier curves will be generated and the median time 
to event and the associated 95% CI  be provided.  
Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed through  the analysis of the reported incidence of treatment -emergent 
AEs.  Treatment -emergent AEs are those with an onset on or after the initiation of therapy, and 
will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03.  A copy of CTCAE scoring system may be 
downloaded from: https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE . 
The AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and summarized using system organ class and preferred term for all pati ents in the Safety Population.  
In addition, summaries of serious adverse events ( SAEs ), AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, AEs by [CONTACT_246767], and AEs related to study treatment will 
also be presented .  
Other safety endpoints including changes in laboratory results, vital signs and ECG findings will be summarized for the safety population.  Summaries of laboratory abnormalities based on maximum CTCAE grading will also be produced.

10.5.2 Planned Interim Analysis  
No interim analyses are planned.  Interim results may be pres ented at congress prior to final 
study report, if applicable.  The design follows that of Simon et al. 1989.  If < 2 of the initial 23 
patients enrolled in the study fail to achieve a response, the study will be stopped and the remaining 33 additional patients will not be enrolled.  Patients will be evaluated for response to 
treatment every 3 cycles.  Patients will be removed from treatment at the time of disease progression.  Patients demonstrating an extended period of stable disease will be considered non-responders after 12 cycles of treatment.

humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An adverse event (also known as adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a drug, without any judgement about causality.   An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, dose or including overdose.   
11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “serious” if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE , defined as any adverse experience that places the subject, in the 
view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of occurrence; i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171762] 24-hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in de ath, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias

abuse.   
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” AE, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  Seriousness serves as the gu ide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient/event outcome or action usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the SAE Report Form. 
11.1.3 Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction  (AR) means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is a reason to conclude that the drug caused 
the event.  
11.1.4 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction  (SAR) means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  A n SAR  
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
11.1.5 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs of any patient during the course of the research study will be recorded in the eCRF, and the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_246718] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration). 
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) or not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study treatment), and outcome, should be provided, along with the investigator’s assessment of causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a suspected treatment -related event there should be a t least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03, and changes will be documented. 
If the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to SCRI  Innovations SD .  Other untoward 
events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that 
occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run- in).

Page 43 of 70 
 Any clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in physical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, and collected on the relevant eCRF screen.  
Test findings will be reported as an AE if: the test result requires an adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or test findings require additional testing or surgical intervention, a te st result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms, or a test result is 
considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093]. 
Reporting Period for Adverse Events  
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to carfilzomib  treatment (called study 
treatment), spanning from the  start of study treatment, until 30 calendar days after 
discontinuation or completion of study treatment as defined by [CONTACT_64373], are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) included in the eCRF.   
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the study should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE or laborat ory abnormality/ies are not 
likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the eCRF screen.   
After [ADDRESS_769347], or other means will be reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
YES:  There is a plausible temporal  relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study medication, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the study drug, and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
NO:  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre-
existing med ical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication), and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to study drug administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_769348] dose of study drug).

Page 45 of 70 
 11.3 Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1 Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_64338], the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be r ecorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate 
on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen).  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information is available.  If a diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to reflect the diagnosis. 
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_5371] (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an SAE.  
11.3.2 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE eCRF screen.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it should be recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
11.3.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnos is 
needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF screen. 
Abnormal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an 
adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or laboratory findings requir e additional testing or surgical intervention, a laboratory result or finding is associated with 
accompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093]. 
11.3.4 Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol- specified AE reportin g period that are attributed by [CONTACT_585127] “Study Discontinuation” 
eCRF screen.  All other on study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an SAE Report Form and expeditiously reported to the SCRI Innovations SD .

recorded only on t he “After Progressive Disease Follow -Up” eCRF screen.  
11.3.5 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolongation of pre- existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_585110].  There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246721].  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units 
• Observation or short-stay unit 
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125] o r skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_64342] a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was planned prior to entry in the study), does not require reporting as an SAE to the SCRI  
Innovations SD . 
11.3.6 Pre-Existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF screen.  A pre- existing medical 
condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen, it is important to convey the concept that the pre- existing c ondition has 
changed by [CONTACT_9672]. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_769352] one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  11.1.2).  New primary cancers are those that 
are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be reported as an AE/SAE, as they are considered to be disease progression.

 11.3.8 Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies 
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the study or within [ADDRESS_769353] dose of 
study drug, a Pregnancy Form (a paper report form, not available within the eCRF) should be completed and faxed to the SCRI Innovations SD .  SCRI  Innovations SD  should be notified 
expeditiously, irrespective of whether or not i t meets the criteria for expedited reporting.  
Abortions (spontaneous, accidental, or therapeutic) must also be reported to SCRI Innovations SD. 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in this study, this must be reported to the SCRI Innovations SD  immediately.  Every effort should 
be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.  New borns should be followed 
for a minimum of 12 weeks.  
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always meet SAE cr iteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.  
If the subject becomes pregnant, the drug will be immediately discontinued.  The investigator will discuss the risks and concerns of investigational drug exposure to a developi[INVESTIGATOR_185188]/or pregnant partner (or ensure that such counseling is provided).  
SCRI Innovations SD will notify Onyx DS within [ADDRESS_769354] knowledge of the event using the corresponding screens in the eCRF and following the same process described for SAE reporting (see Section  11.2) if the overdose is symptomatic. 
For information on how to manage an overdose of carfilzomib , see the IB.

• Event(s) is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed 
• An event(s) is not consistent with the General Investigative Plan or in the current 
application  
• Includes AEs or SAR that may be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the study drug, or that occur with members of the drug class, but that have previously been 
observed under investigation 
When applicable, an unexpected adverse event may also apply to an ev ent that is not listed in the 
current US Package Insert (USPI) or an event that may be mentioned in the USPI, but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.    
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R), these events suspected (by [CONTACT_9304]) to be related to the study drug, are unexpected (not listed in the IB or USPI), and are serious (as defined by [CONTACT_760]) and require expedient submission to relevant health authorities within 7 days (fat al or life -threatening event) or 15 days (all serious 
events), or as defined by [CONTACT_2371].  The term S[LOCATION_003]R is used primarily in the reporting of events to regulatory authorities.

14.3 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a patient voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular study after having been inf ormed of all aspects of the study that are 
relevant to the patient's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a written, signed, and dated informed consent form (ICF) . 
The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is re sponsible for review and approval of 
the study.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_1622], as well as local county authority or state regulations and national requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study , each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the research study.  Once the essential information has been provided to the 
prospective candidate, and the Investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications of participating in this research study, the candidate will be asked to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_8753].  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the ICF, to include the patient’s 
signature, will be provided by [CONTACT_21007]. 
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the study should be obtained. 
14.3.1 Confidentiality  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Confidentiality  
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  HIPAA regulations require that, 
in order to participate in the study, a patient must sign an authorization form for the study that he or she has been informed of following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study 
• Who will have access t o that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• That health information may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_64343], and that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_585130] (S): CARFILZOMIB    SCRI INNOVATIONS  STUDY NUMBER : GI 195

patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after 
the conclusion of the study  
• Whether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 
• The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization 
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the end of their sched uled study period.

 15.4 Data Collection 
The study e CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study .  Case report forms will 
be completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable SCRI Innovations  
to review the patie nts’ status throughout the course of the study. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study number, patient number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the eCRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_75502] (e.g., laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to SCRI Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patient identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
All data requested in the eCRF must be supported by [CONTACT_64388]’s source 
documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the e CRF, 
a note should be created verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown.”  For any entry errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided. 
The investigator will electronically sign and date th e patient eCRF casebook indicating that the 
data in the e CRF has been assessed.  Each completed eCRF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1268], once all data for that patient is final.  
15.5 Disclosure and Publication Policy  
All information provided regarding the study , as well as all information collected/documented 
during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential.  SCRI Innovations  reserves the 
right to release literature publications based on the results of the study.  Results from the study 
will be published/presented as per SCRI Innovations ’ publication process.  
Inclusion of the investigator in the authorship of any multi center  publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or critically revising any manuscript(s) derived from the study.  The investigator acknowledges that the study is part of a multicenter  study and agrees that any publication by [CONTACT_585136].  In 
the event there is no multi center  publication within fifteen (15) months after the study has been 
completed or terminated at all study sites, and all data has been received, the investi gator shall 
have the right to publish its results from the study , patient  to the notice requirements described 
herein and patient  to acknowledgement of SCRI Innovations  as appropriate.  Investigator shall 
provide SCRI Innovations  thirty (30) days to review a manuscript or any poster presentation, 
abstract or other written or oral material which describes the results of the study for the purpose only of determining if any confidential or patentable information is disclosed thereby.  If SCRI Innovations requests in writing, the investigator shall withhold any publication or presentation an additional sixty (60) days solely to permit SCRI Innovations  to seek patent protection and to 
remove any SCRI Innovations Confidential Information from all publications.

 Appendix C: Guidelines for Female Patient s of Child bearing  Potential and Fertile  Male 
Patient s 
 
Acceptable Contraception Methods:    
Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 3 months after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056].   
Highly effective contraception is defined as either: True Abstinence When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Sterilization   When a woman of childbearing potential has had surgical bilateral 
oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to study entry.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_104]. 
Male P artner Sterilization  When  the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate. 
Use of a combination of any two of the following ( one from a + one from b):  
a)  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS)   
b
)  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap 
(diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository . 
Fertile male patients, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring,  
with female partners of child -bearing potential must use condoms plus spermicidal agent 
during the study treatment period and for [ADDRESS_769377] also refrain  from donating sperm during their participation in the study.  
The following are acceptable forms of barrier contraception:  
• Latex condom, diaphragm or cervical/vault cap when used with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
Unacceptable Contraception Methods:  f
 or women of childbearing potential include: 
• IUD progesterone T  
• Female condom

 • Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  
Pregnancies  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on study treatment must be reported to 
the SCRI  Innovations Safety Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The 
pregnancy should be followed up for 3 months after the termination of the pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or new born complications.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_585137] .  Pregnancy follow-up should be 
recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study drug  of any pregnancy outcome.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be 
reported on the SAE Report Form. 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study.  Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. 
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows:   
• Women are considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have 
had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).  
• Women who are permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy).   
• Women who are > [ADDRESS_769378] a 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value >40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value <40 pg/mL (140 pmol/L). 
• Women who are > [ADDRESS_769379] had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH >40 mIU/mL and estradiol <40 pg/mL prior to initiation of hormone- replacement therapy .

 Appendix E: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 
Definitions  
Response an d progression will be evaluated in this study  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al 2009).  Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria 
provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
Baseline Eligibility  
Measurable Disease:  Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement  is to be recorded) with a 
minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_769386] by [CONTACT_14781] (CT scan slice thickness 
no greater than 5 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as no n-
measurable). 
• [ADDRESS_769387] x -ray. 
 
Skin lesions:   Documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:   To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node mu st be ≥[ADDRESS_769388] scan.  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-Measurable Disease:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <<10 mm or 
pathological lymph node s with ≥10 - to <<15- mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or  lung, abdominal masses, 
abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_20475].  
Target Lesions:  The most reproducible measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5  lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), should be representative of all involv ed organs, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion or a short axis of ≥[ADDRESS_769389] scan.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted 
above, only the sho rt axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response.  
Non-Target Lesions:  All other lesions should be identified as non- target lesions at baseline.  
Measurements of these  lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable w hen they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥[ADDRESS_769391] X -ray: Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, a CT scan is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI:  CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has 
defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT 
slice thickness is 5mm or less.  When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Ultrasound:  When the primary study endpoint is objective response, ultrasound should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound may also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy:  Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Therefore, use of these techniques for 
objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in 
specialized centers.  Such techniques can be useful in confirming complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor Markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the upper limit of normal, they  must normalize for a subject to 
be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have 
disappeared.  
Cytology and Histology:  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response 
(PR) and complete response (CR) in rare ca ses (e.g., after treatment to 
differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).

 Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesio ns.   
Partial Response (PR):  
 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target  
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. . 
Stable Disease (SD):   
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify f or PD, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum of diameters 
since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease (PD):   
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest (nadir) sum since the treatm ent started, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  Requires not only 20% increase, but absolute increase of a minimum of 5  mm over sum.  
 
Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normaliz ation of tumor markers.  
All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size ( <<10 mm short axis).  
Stable Disease (SD):    
 Persistence of one or more non -target lesions and/or persistence of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease ( PD):  
 Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions.  When the subject also has measurable disease, to 
achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, 
there must be an overall  level of substantial worsening in non- target disease 
such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
The best ove rall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
In general, the subject’s best response assignmen t will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.   
Confirmation of response (by [CONTACT_340625] 4 weeks or as specified in the protocol) is required for studies in 
which response rate is the primary endpoint, but is not re quired in randomized studies  or studies  with primary 
survival endpoints (i.e., where response is not a primary endpoint).

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation 
of a CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by [CONTACT_14239][INVESTIGATOR_14166].  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to “normal” size ( <<10 mm), 
they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  Th is measurement should be recorded even though the nodes 
are normal in order not to overstate progression, should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that subject s with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the e CRF.

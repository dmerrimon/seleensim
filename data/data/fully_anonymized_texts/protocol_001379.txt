Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis :   
Home -based pulmonary rehabilitation with proper self -management  support through health coaching  rooted in motivational 
intervention during pulmonary rehabilitation will improve physical we llbeing, qual ity of life, increase daily physical activity , and 
decrease  health care utilization for patients with COPD.  
 
Ai ms, purpose, or objectives:  
The ideal system for a home PR program requires straightforward, accurate technology to monitor physiological param eters, patien t 
engagement, and simple exercises to be performed at home, all ensuring participant safety. Feedback is critical: MI -based health 
coaching, proven effective in COPD,[ADDRESS_1151375]: 
• Home -based PR will increase PR uptake and adherence, a significant existing gap in COPD care.  
• The addition of formal SM support through health coaching during PR may promote behavioral change to prolong the effects 
of PR on critical COPD health outc omes.  
• The home -based PR program may meaningfully engage participants in successful SM and translate into sustained improved 
physical wellbeing (QOL), increased daily PA, and decreased health care utilization for patients with COPD.  
• The proposed home -based PR system u sing “off -the-shelf” hardware and a previously commercialized software (accomplished 
through our Small Business Innovation Research Grant, SBIR 5R44HL114162- 03) will have a high likelihood of 
implementation and dissemination once proven effect ive. 
  
Background :
   
 
Role of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease care  
International guidelines for managing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), one of the main causes of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide,[ADDRESS_1151376]  that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs and self -management support (SM) are a critical part of 
treatment. A com pelling body of evidence confirms that PR programs deliver improved exercise capacity, reduced breathlessness, and 
improved health- related quality of life (QOL)[ADDRESS_1151377] 
costs burden in health care.2, 7 
Adherence to PR is poor 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_210347], the proportion of people with COPD who receive PR is very small, with estimates from developed count ries 
of <20%.[ADDRESS_1151378] 
common patient barrier to attendance is travel to cen ter-based programs, particularly for frail patients with more severe COPD who 
need transportation assistance.3  
Home -based, unsupervised PR has been proposed as an alternative model4 to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- based programs and has been found to be safe 
and effective compared with traditional programs in terms of improvement in exercise tole rance, disease- specific QOL, and degree of 
breathlessness and fatigue.8 However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_829700], the implementation and dissemination of home -based PR has been po or 
in the U nited States due to a lack of simple home -based PR systems that combine proper monitoring and meaningful feedback to the 
patient.8 There is a knowledge and pr actice gap regarding effective systems that can deliver home PR.2, 5 Further research on feasible 
and effective hom e-based PR pa rticularly oriented to a sustained behavior change is needed.  
Aiming for home PR programs with lasting results   
Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, 2018

 It is well documented that the effects of PR diminish over time, with deterioration in both exercise capacity and health -related QO L 
within six to 12 months of program completion.9 One key reason for this decline is the lack of a behavioral change after completing 
PR (developi[INVESTIGATOR_829701]). It  is now postulated that undertaking PR in the home may promote effective behavior change through 
integration of physical activity (PA) routines into daily life.5 Self-management support (SM), which creates ideal conditions for 
behavior change, is now recommended by [CONTACT_829724], particularly in PR programs.2, 10 A recent 
large randomized study of COPD SM11 identifie d lack of patient engagement as the core problem in adopting new behaviors. In that 
study, significant effects on health- related QOL and health care utilization after the SM intervention occurred only in patients who 
were engaged in their care. Brief advice i s not enough to promote behavior change; meaningful engagement is necessary.12 
Health Coaching, promoting a behavior change  
In our previous work, we developed an d tested (R01 HL09468), an effective program for SM in COPD through health coaching13 
rooted in motivational interviewing (MI)13, 14 that decreased COPD re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]6 and produced a sustained i mproved QOL at six 
and 12 months.  
Theoretical Framework  
The theoretical framework of the proposed intervention (Fig. 1) is based on two guiding theories: self -efficacy theory15, 17 and MI 
theory.16 In brief, trai ning in MI prepares the health coach to initiate conversations in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_175946] (compassion, acceptance, 
evocation of the client’s values, and collaboration) and skills (open questions, a non- coercive approach for change, and making the 
participant the ex pert and final decision -maker). The latter (spi[INVESTIGATOR_829702]) may not only impact social persuasion (part of self -
efficacy theory) but also directly increase self -efficacy (confidence) that leads to higher SM abilities (behavior change). Pulmonary 
rehab ilitation directly impacts the foundations of the self -efficacy theory: mastery in PA, by [CONTACT_829725] (Aim 3, 
measured by [CONTACT_829726]), social persuasion (weekly feedback from a trustworthy coach) and emotions and physiology (exercise 
is a known positive factor impacting emotions and COPD physiology). Self -efficacy (Sub aim 2 measured by [CONTACT_829727]) translates 
into SM or behavior change (Aim 2 measured by [CONTACT_829728]30) which in turn impacts physical QOL (Aim 1). We have recently confirmed and published the independent relationship between MI health coaching, SM and quality of life.
6, 18, 19 A proposed path 
analysis will confirm the proposed framework.

research -proven, effective home- based PR system available .  
 Preliminary Data :  
We present th e preliminary data of four projects (tested in previous applications) 
representing critical components that support the proposed home -based PR 
system:  
1. Creating the system using AMs and an Android™ receptor (R44 AG29087- 02A1) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_829703]-specif ic 
QOL (Aim 1)  
2. Effect of the proposed health coaching on sustainable improvement of QOL (Aim 1). (R01 HL09468)  
3. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_829704] (R43 HL 114162- 01) 
4. Refinement of the system and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_829705] (5R44HL114162 -03) 
Project 1 – Creating the System. SBIR project NIH (R44 AG29087 -02A1 Kramer, PI; 
Benzo, Co I) provides the foundation for the proposed mobile system for home PR in this project. In this study, AMs with Blu etooth capabi lities were fastened to the ankle and 
connected to an Android™ device (proposed in the present application). The device then 
transferred activity and patient -reported outcomes to a server, which generated a report 
(Fig. 2) for a coach who revi ewed the data and provided support to participants. The system 
also included daily participant feedback about their symptoms (Fig. 3), which informed the coaching sessions. We tested 50 participants with severe COPD aiming to improve QOL as measured by [CONTACT_829731] (CRQ) (as in Aim 1). We found 
improved QOL at eight weeks, (Fig. 4) and this improvement was  maintained at six 
months.  
          
Qualitative analysis reported the following participant themes: (1) the system was efficaci ous in motivating increased activity; (2) improved wellbeing; (3) appreciation of the 
coach interaction; and (4) interested in a wrist monitor that enabled them to view activity 
(Garmin monitor with display is proposed in this application; see Fig. 5). Coa ch interviews  
indicated that coaches found reports useful and actionable. The technology was friendly and did not interfere with participant - coach communication. All themes and requests of the 
previous study are now incorporated in this application.

Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, [ADDRESS_1151380] 2 –Effect of the proposed health coaching on 
sustainable improvement of QOL (Aim 1). In a randomized 
study (N=215), 6 we tested the proposed MI -based health 
coaching telephone inte rvention (NHLBI R01 HL09468  Benzo, 
PI) to decrease  COPD readmission and to improve QOL. We 
discovered significant improvements in Physical QOL (Aim 1) and Emotional QOL measured by [CONTACT_829732] -
intervention, and also observed that these bene fits were 
maintained at 12 months  (Fig. 6). Health coaching decreased ER 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (see exploratory aim in this 
proposal).6 The SM worksheet is shown in Appendix 1. 
Qualitative anal ysis also demonstrated that the SM support 
intervention was acceptable to patients and interventionists, 
increased self -efficacy for dealing with COPD, and promoted an 
effective working alliance with the coach (Fig. 7). Details of the interventio n are published and publicly available.
[ADDRESS_1151381] 3 –Addition of  physiologic monitoring to the system 
in Project 1: Feasibility and Signal Integrity. In  R43 HL 
114162- 01 (Benzo, Kramer Co I) we tested participants with 
severe COPD, we confirmed the feasibility and integrity of heart rate and oxygen saturation transmission during the proposed PR 
exercise routine in a simulated patient’s home, validating 
transm itted data from the monitor with in -site monitors (gold 
standard).  
Project 4 –Pi[INVESTIGATOR_829706] (home - based 
PR plus coaching) . The finalized proposed system, was 
finalized funded by [CONTACT_74379] (5R44HL114162- 03 Home -Based Health 
Management of COPD Patie nts), and was tested in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_829707]. All participants were able to use the technology and were 100% compliant with daily activity measures. Participants highly rated the helpfulness of the study (8.5, 
scale 0 -10) and ease of technology navigation (9.67, scale 0- 10). A 
preliminary qualitative analysis is shown in Fig. 8.

  Randomized Study:  
Participants will b e randomly as signed in equal proportion to one of two treatments: home PR with health coaching or the attention 
waitlist control (Fig. 9). Participants randomly assigned to the intervention will receive three months of home PR followed by [CONTACT_829733].  
Participants randomly assigned to the active control group will receive three months of usual care plus educati onal materials and non -
coaching  calls (matching the number of contacts in the intervention group), followed by [CONTACT_829734].  
Phase 2:  Participants randomized to intervention will not change; three months of home PR followed by [CONTACT_829735].  
Participants enrolled in the active control group will follow the scheme  listed above; 3 months of usual care followed by [CONTACT_829736].  During the control wait period they will receive a pamphlet of 12 Healthy Habits during the enrollment period as well as two letters during the contr ol period.  T he letters will remind them to review the 12 Healthy Habits 
and will remind them that the exercise portion of the study will start soon.    
 
Phase 3:   Forty Mayo participants who  have competed the intervention  (the 12 weeks  of home -based pulmona ry rehab with health 
coaching) will be randomly selected to complete a qualitative interview  to explore areas related to the intervention, quality of life and 
symptom severity .    The purpose of the qualitative interview is to take an  in-depth look at the  appropriat eness of the intervention as a 
potential method of treatment a s well as examining the impact on the participant as a whole.  Mayo Clinic participants who have 
completed the interv ention p ortion of the study will be contact[CONTACT_829737].   If interested, oral consent will be conducted.  A mutu ally agreed upon time a nd date for the interview will be confirmed.   
(A phone script will be used. )  The participants will re ceive $[ADDRESS_1151382]. Benzo. (A 
guided interview script will be used.)    
 
In addition,  the five Mayo Clinic staff who se rved as health coaches on the study wi ll also be offered the opportunity to be i nterviewed 
to learn  their experiences  in the program.  The interviews will be condu cted by [CONTACT_829738], [CONTACT_829750], either  in a 
private space or by [CONTACT_25600].  The inte rview will b e recorded so that it can later be transcribed  and analyzed.   An email inviting the 
health coach to partic ipate will be sent to the health coach.  The health coach w ill be orally consented and will have the option to opt 
out.

  Questionnaires:  
Physical QOL will be assessed by [CONTACT_788806] (Aim 1), SM abilities, self -efficacy (Aim 2), and d aily PA and self -efficacy for exercise 
(Aim 3). These QOL components will be measured at baseline, three, six, and nine months af ter ran domization in both groups. 
Qualitative analysis (Aim 4) will occur after the intervention in order  to further understan d the inter vention’s acceptability and to help 
interpret the comparative effectiveness findings from Aims 1- 3.  
Additional QOL que stionna ires will include the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL -12), the Meaning of Life Questio nnaire 
(MLQ6), and th e Longitudinal Analogue Self -Assessment (LASA6).    Recent research has indicated that social support and sense of 
meaning of life  are im portant indicators in the perception of quality of life.  The added questionnaires will better mea sure these 
important factors.

Research Activity  
 
Randomization  
Eligible participants (after the screening call) will visit the site for the consenting process. In the clinic visit, all consented participa nts 
will receive baseline questionnaires, and information about  the system. They will complete the questionnaires during the visit, and 
take home the ActiGraph ™ AM (Fig. 10), to wear for one week. On return of the AM, the study coordinator will randomly assign the 
participant to intervention or attention waitlist control through a centralized program, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_829739] (forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_12194] [FEV1]  <50% predicted) 
and whether the participant has severe dyspnea  (recorded modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale [mMRC] score, 3 -4; 
scale, 0 -4); critical factors that can make the study arms unbalanced regarding risk factors. The study coordinator  will call the 
participant and inform him or her of the results  of randomization. Intervention participants will be mailed the home -based PR system 
(pulse oximeter, tablet and Garmin Vivofit™ ). While blinding participants will not be possible, as most behavioral interventions, the 
arms will be blinded to the research team in charge of the data entry and statistical analysis and revealed only at study conclusion.  
 
Clinic Visit: Face -to-Face Encounter 
The participant will practice the use of the proposed system and the PR routine in the PR lab to ensure understanding an d safety; 
therefore, no home visits are planned. The clinic visit is the best opportunity to evaluate the confidence of the individual in using the 
system. The study team will provide step -by-step instructions on how to perform the daily home -based PR routine (Fig. 11) and 
discuss the home environment where PR will take place to define the optimal conditions, particularly safety, for exercise. The 
participant will be asked to rate their confiden ce to use the technology presented and their confidence (self -efficacy) to perform the 
home rehabilitation routine on a scale from 0 (no confidence) to 10 (great confidence). A rating of six or greater will be de emed an 
acceptable confidence level to parti cipate in the study.  
Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, [ADDRESS_1151385] and time they can perform the 
home -based PR. The physical and mental 
environment is critical for the successful 
adoption of new behavior (PR). Each 
participant will learn about the weekly calls with the coach to discuss their rehabilitation and monitored measures (steps, level of shortness of breath, wellbeing and fatigue). They will then go over the daily answers to 
wellbeing questions (mood, energy, and 
breathlessness as tes ted in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]) (Fig. 
3). After performing the PR routi ne (to ensure 
safety and understanding) and reviewing use of the monitors, a plan for the following week will be discussed. The coach will also confer 
with the participant and caregiver to identify 
possible exercise- related fall hazards in the 
home environment (see Human Protections section).  
Strategies for promoting recruitment and 
retention  
A thorough explanation of the technology and 
measures required will contribute to a better understandi ng of the study and decrease the 
risk of dropout. In the screening visit, the study coordinator will clearly and carefully explain 
the benefits of enrolling and the duties in this 
study from the perspective of potential participants. These benefits include  access to 
home -based PR and a coach, who is describe 
safety an d benefits of the proposed exercise in 
the home, the weekly call with a coach, the steps, oxygen and heart rate monitoring, and SM 
support. All tasks related to study participation (e.g., quest ionnaires and utilization of AMs) will 
be carefully explained.  We believe that the proposed study design will be attractive to both 
intervention and control participants.  
Intervention Group  
Participants are to engage in the home PR at least six days a w eek. The Garmin Vívofit™ AM 
(Fig. 5)  is to be worn at all times  (battery lasts one year)  to capture daily steps and metabolic 
equivalent of task (METs) per day. The PR routine begins with a slow breathing awareness exercise, “pursed lips breathing,” follow ed by [CONTACT_210380] -extremity exercises ( Fig. 12) and a 6- minute walk ( in the home or outside) 
finishing with another slow breathing- awareness exercise.  
Participants will complete two 6 -minute walks, either right after or at another time of day. The exercise prot ocol lasts about 24 
minutes, which is the amount of dedicated exercise time associated with a risk reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210351]
23, 24 and 
is recommend ed by [CONTACT_210381].2 The proposed protocol is currently being used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_829713] a prospective 
COPD trial (NIH NCI R01CA163293- 03). The PR coach will contact [CONTACT_39548] i mary care or referring provider before PR to introduce the 
provider to the study as well as coordinate and develop a strategy in case of a COPD exacerbation (a common cause of PR 
abandonment).  
The proposed home -b ased PR system (Fig. 11)  consists of three  commercial devices and two software application. The devices are a 
Garmin Vívofit™ AM,  a Nonin 3150 WristOx 2® Pulse Oximeter (PO), and a 7” Android ™ tablet with 3G/4G cellular service. The 
AM and PO wirelessly communicate with the tablet via Bluetooth. D uring the upper extremity exercise routine (Fig. 12) and 6 -minute 
walks, the PO measures the participants’ heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO 2). Near the end of the day, the tablets

 periodically sound a musical alarm and display a short health status  questionnaire (as demonstrated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], Fig. 3)25 asking 
participants to rate their wellb eing,25 ease of breathing, and energy lev el. At night, the tablets securely transmit the device data and 
wellbeing questionnaire answers to a remote Web server, which securely stores the data and generates reports. Health coaches call  the 
participants weekly to discuss their progress in PR and SM  (see below).  
Participant software application : When the participant turns on the Android™ tablet, the application logs in, and the participant 
accesses two main screens (see appendix for all g raphics). First Screen:  
 
1) The top left corner of the screen displays the participant’s step count, step goal, and remaining number of steps. The top 
center of the screen shows a motivational message (based on the participant’s progress). The top right corner displays the 
weather, an important factor for the PR coach  to consider when interpreting a participant’s PA. The remainder of the screen 
displays the daily PR activities.  
 
2) To initiate one of these activities, the user selects the corresponding act ivity from the “To -Do” column. Selecting 
“Exercise” from the “T o-Do” column initiates a video guiding the user through the PR exercises. Similarly, selecting “Walk” 
from the “To -Do” column starts a 6 -minute countdown once the application detects that the participant has initiated walking. 
Before displaying the exercise and walking videos (asked to be followed), the application verifies that the participant is 
wearing the AM and PO to assure measure and compliance (during exercise an increase in heart rate is expected). When the 
participant finishes the selected activity, it appears in the “Done” column. The application provides instructions before and between each activity.  
The second screen plots historical data, allowing the participant to see trends as in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. From this screen, the user is able to view d aily steps, average heart rate, SpO
2, and questionnaire answers. The user also is able to select the historical 
window (e.g., last week, last month, last quarter).  
Coaching Calls (weeks 1- 12) content for PR feedback plus SM : After the in -person visit, coaching calls will occur weekly for 12 
weeks following the published protocol:13  
1) Set the call agenda. Listen for the participant’s exercise description, ask whi ch exercises were successful, and affirm. 2) 
Provide feedback of monitored sessions and generate dialog by [CONTACT_255400] “change talk” (participant’s comments on anticipated activities he or sh e wants to do). 3) If problems arise, resist the urge to attempt to solve the participant’s 
problems and barriers. 4) Listen carefully and kindly (ambivalence from the participant in changing their behavior). 5) Discuss how behaviors connect to the participant’s values and strengths. 6) Collaborate in setting goal(s) for the following week. 7) Discuss the process of action planning: elicit the participant’s preferences/desires for behavior 
change. 8) Elicit the participant’s choice; do  not assign  goals,  and use the participant’s  language  to describe  the goal. 9) 
Assess  confidence  for goal completion, reaffirm  commitment  to the action  plan,  and express  optimism. 10) Thank the 
participant and plan the next call.  
All calls will be recorded to ensure compliance  with the protocol and MI principles (10% of all calls will be reviewed).     
Recorded files are saved on the restricted research drive, accessible only to study staff.  The recorded files are to be 
deleted off the drive after analysis of the intervention is completed and study is finished.  Only ten percent of the cal ls 
are reviewed, and that is to feedback and training to the health coach.  
 Coach Training  
Details of the health coach training have been published and publicly available.[ADDRESS_1151386] common providers of care in PR, as opposed 
to psychologists.  Training includes: 1) face -to-face education on theory and strategies associated with SM education and MI in 
general (six hours); 2) reading materials detailing skills and strategies associated with SM education  and MI;  3) rol e play -based 
experiential learning of intervention strategies w ith participant vignettes (five hours); and 4) recorded and reviewed intervention 
sessions in which interventionists provide tailored training to discuss strengths, missed opportunities for use  of intervention strategies, 
and any deviations from the intervention protocol (10 hours over six months). The rationale for the latter is that training sessions that 
incorporate feedback from coded sessions increase skill retention.  All training sessions will be audio or video recorded for future 
review to minimize d rift from intervention protocol.   
Health Coach Software Application :  (see Appendix 1 for full size graphics and reports).  
The health coach software application provides three types of reports. The overview report (Fig. 13) allows health coaches to 
succinct ly ascertain the status of their participants and flag anyone who may be experiencing problems. The health coach may select a  
Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, 2018  
 
 Page 10 of 17 
 participant from the overview to display the trend report (Fig. 14). The trend report allows the health coach to review the partic ipant’s 
progress between weekly health coaching sessions. Finally, the health coach may select a day from the trend report to display a 
detailed report (Fig. 15). These three reports are updated after the results of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (preliminary data proj ects 1 and 3) are 
generated.  
While participant monitoring does not occur in real time, any 
significant physiologic abnormality measured during rehabilitation and transmitted to the server (O
2 saturation less than 
80% or heart rate >140 or <40 beats per minute) prompts a message to the coach to call the participant to investigate the event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_210354] [ADDRESS_1151387].   T he questionnaires are reviewed and entered into REDCap 
in a timely basis.  If a participant indicates a score of 3 or higher on the PHQ 9 , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_10718].

Analysis Plan  
Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, [ADDRESS_1151390] quantitative study hypotheses (inform different aspects  of the process). Hypothesis 1 (Aim 1) states that 
participants on home -based PR will have higher physical (dyspnea fatigue) QOL at month three than participants in the waitlist 
control group as measured by [CONTACT_829740]. Hypothesis  2 (Aim  2) is that participants on home -based PR will 
have better SM abilities at month three than participants in the waitlist control group. The SMAS -[ADDRESS_1151391] this 
hypothesis. Hypothe sis 3 (Aim 3) is that participants on home -based PR will  have m ore daily PA than participants in the control group 
at month three. This will be measured by [CONTACT_829741], light, and moderate activity measured by [CONTACT_829742]34, [ADDRESS_1151392] activity 
monitor used for outcome measures (7- day wearing) at baseline, 3, [ADDRESS_1151393] for health coaching and participant awarene ss of physical 
activity (participant will keep this activity mo nitor after PR).  
For the continuous study outcomes, changes from baseline to three months will be compared between the study arms using two-s
ample, two -sided t -tests with 5% type I error rates . Changes in QOL and number of steps will be compared be tween t he two 
treatment sequences using two -sample two -sided t -tests. No adjustments will be made for multiple testing. Means, SDs, medians, 
ranges, and frequency distributions will be reported and plotted over time by [CONTACT_30157]. Additional analyses will c ompare changes 
from baseline to three months. Linear models will be used to assess the impact of treatment arm on three month outcomes after adjusting for the corresponding baseline measure and other variables related to the outcome (age, degree of breathl essness at baseline 
using the mMRC, and FEV1. Repeated measures mixed models will be used to estimate the intervention effect over the three mont hs 
of the comparison study. Although there is a crossover element to the study design, crossover analyses will not be used due to the anticipated carryover effect in the intervention arm.  Intent -to-treat analyses will also be performed to determine the sensitivity of the 
results to dropouts and missing values.  In the intent- to-treat analyses, if a month three measu re is m issing for any reason, it will be 
described as not changing from baseline. Health care utilization (number of ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and length of stay) between 
baseline and three months will be treated (analyzed) as both binary (for incidence  rates)  and continuous (for the number of events). 
The binary endpoints will  all be compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression models will also be fit to look 
for differenc es in these outcomes by [CONTACT_210393], mMR C, FEV1 , baseline levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, and 
baseline health care utilization (before starting the study). While significant missing -ness (>5%) in the Aim [ADDRESS_1151394] on the intervention arm. These results will be only descriptive and 
explora tory. N o formal hypothesis testing will be done. All data will be stored in REDCap and analyzed using SAS (Cary, NC).  
Missing Values treatment : Initially, Little’s test for missing completely at rando m (MCAR)
36 will be used along with Potthoff and 
colleagues assessment of missing at ran dom (MAR+).37 Contingent on either MCAR or MAR data, imputation will  be considered in 
order to respond to the level of missing- ness and to be able to use the optimal amount of information in our model. In case of 
participant withdrawal, all available data will be used . 
Path analysis : The hypothesized framework will be test ed using structural equation modeling (SEM), which allows us to examine 
multiple dependent variables in one model and concurrently describe multiple paths of direct and indirect effects among the t heoretical 
constructs. We will use two steps in SEM analyse s. Firs t, the validity of the measures will be assessed by [CONTACT_6486] a measurement model 
and investigating whether the items are strong indicators of the latent constructs (e.g., self -efficacy and quali ty of life). The second 
step involves testing the effect  of the  predictor variables (e.g., MI training, mastery in PA, social persuasion, physiological and 
emotional states) on the outcome variables (e.g., self- efficacy, self -management, and physical QOL) with a particular interest in the 
role self -efficacy has  in inc reasing self -management and physical QOL. In addition to the direct effects of MI training on self -efficacy, 
self-efficacy on self -management, self -management on physical QOL, mediating effects  can be tested, such as the effects of MI 
training on se lf-mana gement and physical QOL, or effects of self- efficacy on physical QOL by [CONTACT_829743]. The 
model will be tested using lavaan, the R software package for SEM.38 The model fit will be examined by [CONTACT_829744] χ2 , goodness -of-fit 
index (GFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).  
Qualitative Analysis (Aim 4) : Perceptions of the participants and the interventionist will be captured using qualitative meth ods. 
Qualitative inquiry in randomized controlled trials help interpret results and variation in results.39 It can also help ensure that 
interventions meet stakeholder needs and therefore aid in future transferability of interventions like the proposed system. This is 
increasingly important as trials move out of controlled setting s and into the social context of natural settings,40 including participant 
homes.  
This qualitative approach is part of an embedded mixed- methods design, a design commonly used when individuals’ perspectives 
inform experimental results.( 33)  This aim also helps us better understand the contextual factors related to implementation. As such, it 
Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, 2018  
 
 Page 13 of 17 
 reflects the principles of a ty pe 1 hybrid effectiveness -implementation design, the rationale for which is to study barriers and 
facilitators to widespread implementation alongside the intervention’s effectiveness, speeding future translation into practice.41 
The interview instruments will be informed by [CONTACT_829745], and quantitative results will guide the qualitative sampling 
plan. Specifically, the purposive sampling for interviews and in order to increase the breath of representativeness of the  interviewees , 
we will use baseline scores o n the Patient Activation Measure to stratify the population available for interview recruitment, and we 
will aim to interview 10 patients with lower  levels of activation at baseline (Stages 1 and 2 indicating lower participant engagement) 
and 10 patients with higher levels (stages 3 and 4 indicating higher engagement) AND patients with high severity defined by a MRC 
dyspnea score 3- 4 (10 participants)  vs. low severity - score 0 -2-(10 participants). This variation in the sample will better ensure a range 
of experiences in the data and allow understanding of different opi[INVESTIGATOR_829715]. Patient activation in particular has been shown 
to impact adherence to self -care regimens, including home monitoring.  
Data Colle ction  
The primary method of qualitative data collection will be individual semi- structured interviews with a sample of participants in the 
intervention arm (n=40) and study interventionists (n=4). Interviews will be conducted at approximately week 12 (around the time of the last interventionist call). We will use an interview guide —reviewed by [CONTACT_106971] (patients and clinicians) —to ask a combination of 
broad, open- ended questions and focused quest ions eliciting information about: 1) the participant’s impressions of the program; 2) 
impressions of program  effectiveness or perceived benefits; and 3) participant’s prior experience with coaching. The interview guide 
will be informed by [CONTACT_829746], ( i.e., self -efficacy theory and MI)
15, [ADDRESS_1151395]  by [CONTACT_829747]. After each interview, the interviewer will take detailed notes that describe the context o f the interview, emerging themes or 
issues that arose in the in terview, areas for clarification, and other comments. These notes and transcripts will be used in analysis. Per 
the reviewers’ suggestions, we purposefully included a qualitative expert, Jennifer Ridgeway, to conduct this analysis and work collaboratively with [CONTACT_829751], as they have previous ly reported  qualitative analysis  together.
[ADDRESS_1151396] 
two investigators  will review the data and use an iterative process to develop l abels or codes and then higher -order categori es that 
represent key themes related to the study aims. These will be informed by [CONTACT_829748] 1- 3. A coding 
framework will b e independently applied to transcripts before the investigators  discuss and agree on coding. Data will be en tered into 
NVivo software (NVivo 10.1, QSR International Pty. Ltd.) or another system for text data management to facilitate queries.  
Integration w ith Aims 1 -3: The function of the mixed- methods design is elaboration of the quantitative data on effectiveness with the 
qualitative findings. After initial quantitative and qualitative analyses are complete, the investigators will place findings  side-by-side 
to explore connections as well as divergent findings that need further exploration. This includes within - and between -case analysis to 
understand the perspectives of participants who differed on comparative effectiveness outcomes (Aim 1- 3) as well as t hose who 
differed in important baseline characteristics such as  participant activation.  
Sample Size :  We wi ll enroll at total of 200 participants , with 100 in each arm. Sample size calculations are based on two- sample, 
two-sized t -tests comparing the two groups at 3 months. Aim 1 : We calculated the sample size based on estimates from our previously 
published da ta6. From this research, the CRQ has a SD of about 1.13. A total sample of 189 participants (94 or 95 per group) is needed 
to detect a difference of 0.5 (the minimal clinically important difference) in the CRQ with 80% power. Based on our previous health 
coaching application (R01HL09468 Benzo, PI),[ADDRESS_1151397]  5% attrition .  We will therefore enroll 200 participants, 100  in each arm.  
Aim 2 : A sample size of [ADDRESS_1151398] a half SD change in SMAS -30 based on COPD studies using this measure. Aim 3 : 
The number of steps recorded by [CONTACT_829749] a valid measure of  PA in patients with COPD and the elderly. The clinically 
meaningful difference in steps is estimated at 1100. Therefore, a sample size of 170 participants (85 per group) is needed considering 
a SD of 2500 steps from our previous study.6 Aim 4: The sample size of [ADDRESS_1151399] concurrently and iteratively to inform the sampling plan. We will 
continue interviewing until s aturation (the point at which interviews are not yielding much new information) is reached; the sample 
Protocol Version 2:  M arch 1, [ADDRESS_1151400] low (versus high) 
levels of initial participant activation or those who differ in comp arative -effectiveness outcomes. We will ensure ample participan ts to 
represent a range of opi[INVESTIGATOR_829716], rather than statistical testing. In regard to interventionist data collection, we 
will invite all interventionists (n=4) in the study to complete an interview; based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we expec t high participation.   
Limitations: While co mparing the proposed intervention to center -based PR would be the  ideal study , it would not be feasible 
because most participants cannot attend PR  weekly (about 70%)3 and the study would be unlikely to accrue sufficiently. This study i s 
geared to capture the population willing to do home PR, and individuals who are confident using technology:  results may not be 
generalizable to all individuals with COPD. We realize that som e participants randomly assigned to the control group will rece ive 
center -based PR, and we plan to document and adjust our model analyses accordingly (intention- to-treat analysis) despi[INVESTIGATOR_829717], the study will address a critical need in COPD care: bringing PR to all individuals with COPD.  
Conclusions  
The pr oposed study will be the first of its kind co mbining monitored home -based PM with theory -driven SM support 
through health coaching. Since there is no system available for home -based PR delivery the results of this application are 
critically needed in the field of COPD. We envision that the proposed intervention is feasible (already tested) and using 
commercially available software and hardware will be ready to be disseminated if effective.  Health Coaching will bring higher participant engagement, better participant provider communication, and possibl y improved outcomes. Inclusion of qualitative 
inquiry will strengthen our understanding of our results and provide further information for implement ation/ dissemination  
Timeline : This project will take five years to complete. The first year will be spent on institutional approvals (two months); 
development of materials (four months); training of health coaches on site; database creation; and the sta rt of the clinical trial. Years 
2-4 will involve the accrual of  all subjects and the completion of the clinical trial. A Method Paper will be produced and published in 
Year 2. The final year will involve the end of the clinical trial (first quarter) data analysis, triangulation of the quantitative with the qualitative  analysis manuscript publication, and prepara tions for grant renewal.

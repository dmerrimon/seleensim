I. BACKGROUND 
 
BPH and LUTS :  Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with its related symptoms is a common 
condition that affects nearly half of men over age 50 and 90% of men over 80.[ADDRESS_382381] symptoms (LUTS) caused by [CONTACT_310895], frequency, urgency, hesitancy, 
intermittency and incomplete emptying, can be very bothersome, affect an individual’s lifestyle 
significantly, and are costly.2  The anatomical location of the human prostate and the urethra 
lend itself to the development of LUTS, including both obstructive and irritative symptoms.  The 
initial evaluation of BPH/LUTS includes administration of the seven -item American Urological 
Association Symptom Index (AUASI) which evaluates the presence and severity of the main 
components of LUTS. The importance of symptoms in the pathophysiology of BPH is 
underscored by [CONTACT_310896] 78% of all endpoints from the 
recent Medical Treatment of Prostate Symptoms (MTOPS) trial, compared to 22% of endpoints 
for objective measures such as urinary retention and urinary tract infection.3  BPH, in large part, 
is a neural phenomenon given that sensory symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and nocturia 
are the key factors that push patients to seek treatment.  Increasing basic and clinical evidence 
suggests that neural pathways within the prostate modulate bladder storage function and may 
play a significant role in LUTS.  
 
Prostate Innervation:  The prostate is dually innervated by [CONTACT_310897].[ADDRESS_382382] (T10-L2) and course 
within the hypogastric nerve as either presynaptic neurons to terminate on short post -ganglionic 
adrenergic fibers near the prostate or as post -ganglionic neurons via the sympatheti c chain to 
terminate directly on prostatic smooth muscle.  The majority of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_310856].  
Parasympathetic fibers arise from the lumbo-sacral cord (L5-S1) and course within the pelvic 
nerve to synapse on post -ganglionic fibers within peri -prostatic ganglion.  Parasympathetic, 
cholinergic fibers localize to the prostatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], where their main function is thought to 
involve regulation of prostatic secretions.  Recent data demonstrate a robust cholinergic 
innervation within the human prostate with muscarinic receptor densities exceeding those of 
alpha-adrenergic receptors.5    In addition, the sensory nociceptor TRPV1 has been localized in 
abundance within prostatic urethral mucosa and prostatic acini.  Taken into context, there 
should be no doubt that prostate innervation plays a key role in the development and 
pathophysiology of LUTS.  
 
Alpha-adrenergic Receptor Antagonists for BPH : While surgery remains the gold standard for 
relieving obstruction and symptoms, more recent attention has been focused on 
pharmacotherapy as an alternative approach.  The American Urological Association 
recommends alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers as first -line pharmacologic therapy for male 
patients suffering from LUTS/BPH.  Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers  antagonize adrenergic 
receptors, blocking the effects of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_310857].  
The end result is reduced smooth muscle tone.  Of  the three known α -adrenergic receptors 
(α1 A, α1 B, and α1 D), α1 A is the most abundant within the prostate, the α1 B subtype is 
predominant within peripheral blood vessels, and the α1 D receptor subtype is localized to the 
bladder and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  Numerous s tudies have documented a beneficial effect of alpha-
adrenergic receptor blockers for improving LUTS and urinary flowrates.[ADDRESS_382383] of men discontinue drug use despi[INVESTIGATOR_310858].7  In addition, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers directly target sympathetic

and LUTS.  
 
Effects of Surgical Denervation:   McVary and colleagues demonstrated that surgical denervation 
of the rat  prostate induces significant changes in the size of the rat ventral prostatic lobe.[ADDRESS_382385] of targeted 
prostate denervation on male LUTS associated with BPH . 
 
 
Onabotulinum toxinA (onaBoNT -A) Mechanism of Action:  In the search for more effective non-
invasive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_310859], the role of somatic and visceral neuromuscular activity in the 
manifestation of LUTS has been studied.10  OnaBoNT -A (BOTOX, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA ) 
was first introduced as a therapeutic agent in the late 1970’s for strabismus; thereafter, 
onabotulinum toxinA  has been safely used in the treatment of numerous other disorders 
characterized by [CONTACT_310898].[ADDRESS_382386] significant side effects.  
OnaBoNT’s primary function is to inhibit the exocytosis of acetylcholine from the presynaptic 
nerve terminal.  After binding to the nerve cell membrane at a specific acceptor/receptor site 
and internalizing into the cell, onaBoNT cleaves one or more specific SNARE proteins that lead 
to reduced neurotransmitter release. At greater doses, it can also block the release of other 
neurotransmitters including norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], substance P, calcitonin-gene related peptide and 
glutamate.15   
 
Chem ical Denervation of Prostate with onaBoNT -A:  When injected into rat prostates, onaBoNT -
A produces: (1) a generalized atrophy of the prostatic gland with no evidence of inflammatory 
infiltrate; (2) an increase in apoptosis with DNA fragmentation and format ion of apoptotic bodies 
on Tunnel stain and decrease in proliferation; (3) a reduction in the proliferation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_310860]; ( 4) a reduction in α1 A adrenergic receptor but not androgen receptor expression.16, [ADDRESS_382387] 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 5 of 32 8/15/18   
of onaBoNT -A on parasympathetic or sympathetic pathways has not been evaluated in 
humans.19 
 
OnaBoNT -A: Effective Treatment for Male LUTS Refractory to Medical Therapy :  The effect of 
onaBoNT -A on LUTS associated with BPH has been evaluated in several studies in men that 
have failed standard ther apy with an alpha-adrenergic antagonist + 5α -reductase inhibitor.  The 
first off-label use of onaBoNT -A to treat BPH in humans was reported by [CONTACT_310899] 2003.13 
In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, 30 men with symptomatic BPH were randomized to 
receive either saline or 200 units of onaBoNT -A.  One hundred units of onaBoNT -A in 2 cc of 
saline or saline alone were injected into each lobe of the prostate through the perineum via a 
22-gauge spi[INVESTIGATOR_310861].  Clinical improvement was evident 
within 1 month of treatment in the onaBoNT -A group.  By 2 months, 13 patients in the treatment 
group (87%) versus 3 patients in the cont rol group (10%) reported subjective BPH symptom 
relief (p = 0.[ZIP_CODE]).  At 12 months, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) decreased 
by 62%, max urinary flowrate (Qmax) increased by 85%, post void residual (PVR) urine 
decreased by 85%, and prostate size (determined ultrasonographically) decreased by 61%.  
The PSA values were also reduced by 38%.  This degree of improvement was remarkable 
considering the fact that most patients had severe baseline symptoms (average IPSS = 23) and 
the mean prostate size was large (i.e. 52 cc) prior to injection.  No urinary incontinence or 
systemic side effects were reported over the 19.[ADDRESS_382388] looked at specific BPH patient subpopulations to determine the 
effectivenes s of onaBoNT -A treatment.  Kuo et al. treated 10 patients who were either in frank 
urinary retention or carri ed a large PVR.  These patients had already failed combination medical 
therapy (5α -reductase inhibitor and alpha-blocker) were not surgical candidates due to 
comorbid medical conditions.20  Two hundred units of BoNT -A was diluted in 10 cc of saline and 
was injected via a cystoscope into 10 sites in the prostate (4 sites on each lateral lobe, 2 sites at 
the median bar, 20 units per site).  After onaBoNT -A injection, 7 of 10 patients (70%) could void 
spontaneously while 3 required intermittent self -catheterization for 2 weeks.  The therapeutic 
effects were experienced as early as one week after injection.  By 3 and 6 months, significant 
improvements in Qmax, PVR, and prostate volumes were noted (53%, 85%, and 24%, 
respectively).  Eight of ten patients continued to use combination medical therapy after BoNT -A 
injection to maintain good symptomatic relief.   
 
Chuang et al. stratified patients who had failed medical treatment based on the prostate siz e: 
those with <30 cc were treated with 100 units onaBoNT -A while those with >30 cc were treated 
with 200 units (perineal injection).12, 21  At 12 months, the percent improvements in IPSS, Qmax, 
and PVR were very similar to those of Maria et al, except that the percent shrinkage of prostate 
size was substantially smaller (13-19% versus 61%).  In 12 of 41 men (29%) there was no 
change in prostate volume, yet 7 of these 12 men (58%) still had a > 30% improvement in IPSS, 
Qmax, and PVR, suggesting that onaBoNT -A may relieve BPH symptoms in ways other than 
reducing the prostate size alone (i.e. effect on sensory nerv e pathways).   
 
As the table below indicates, a handful of clinical studies have been conducted to date 
measuring the efficacy of onaBoNT -A prostate injections to treat BPH.  However, only two 
studies provide level one evidence of clinical improvement from  onaBoNT -A prostate injection, 
although they strongly disagree on whether onaBoNT -A has any effect on serum PSA level or 
prostate volume.  The remaining open-label studies do not conclusively support the results of 
one randomized trial over the other.  Our  study will provide further level one evidence to either 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 6 of 32 8/15/18   
support or refute the hypothesis that prostate denervation with onaBoNT -A reduces serum 
prostate levels and induces significant atrophy and prostate shrinkage.

No Effective Clinical Marker to Explain LUTS :  The improvement in LUTS following onaBoNT -A 
injection appears unrelated to baseline prostate size or to change in prostate size following 
treatment.  This observation is consistent with prior studies demonstrating a weak correlation 
between the symptoms of LUTS and prostate size, whether in men diagnosed with BPH or men 
in the general community over the age of 50 y ears.22-24 While 5-α -reductase inhibitors (i.e. 
which reduce prostate volume) have virtually no benefit at relieving LUTS25, drugs that do not 
impact prostate volume (i.e. alpha blockers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and anticholinergics) 
are often more effective in relieving LUTS.26-28  Thus, prostate size does not equate with LUTS.  
Because LUTS includes a complex assortment of symptoms affecting urine storage, voiding and 
micturition, Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO) was linked with LUTS.  Urological dogma 
reinforced the theory that BOO was linked with LUTS because of the observation that urinary 
flow decreases and LUTS increases with age.26  Moreover, BOO can be present irrespective of 
prostate size.  However, epi[INVESTIGATOR_310862] a weak correlation between the severity of 
BOO and LUTS.22-24  In addition, changes in urinary flow rate and changes in LUTS following 
alpha blocker therapy and TURP do not strongly correlate providing further evidence that the 
mechanism for symptom improvement following these treatments is not related to simply 
relieving BOO.29, 30  Finally, phosphodiesterase inhibitors improve LUTS without having any 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 7 of 32 8/15/[ADDRESS_382390] on flow rate giving further credence to the notion that neither the pathophysiology of BPH 
nor symptom improvement is dependent on relief of BOO.27  The lack of correlation between 
clinical and subjective measures of LUTS/BPH demands the exploration of novel biological 
markers and molecular targets that not only are associated with moderate to severe LUTS but 
which respond appropriately to treatment and symptom resolution.  
 
Gene Profile Changes with BPH :  Gene expression patterns in BPH are distinct from those 
found in normal and cancerous prostate tissue.[ADDRESS_382391] been 
segregated into 5 main categories:  1. Growth regulatory genes; 2. Immunologic/Inflammatory 
genes; 3. Transcription Factors/ Cell Signalling genes; 4. Stromal Component Genes; and 5. 
Hormone genes.   
 
Bauman and colleagues reported on transcript profiling of proteins associated with androgen 
signaling in epi[INVESTIGATOR_310863].[ADDRESS_382392] tripling of the AR:ERβ  
ratio in BPH stroma as well as significant increases in RL-HSD and a decrease in the ratio of 
AKR1C1:AKR1C2.  These factors all point to the heightened production of DHT as well as the 
decreased metabolism of DHT to the proaptotic ligand 3-β diol.  
 
Significant changes in genes that encode immunological regulation have also been described in 
men with BPH and LUTS including B -cell homing chemokine (i.e. 36 fold increas e from normal), 
and MHC class II DP beta-1 (i.e. 5.5 fold increase compare to normal).33  Increases in 
expression of cytokines such as  IL-1-alpha, -2, -4, -8, -15, -17 as well as decreases in the level 
of the macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 gene (MIC -1), pre-B-cell colony enhancing factor, and 
interferon-stimulated gene have been reported as well.33-[ADDRESS_382393] found a number of these 
genes to be upregulated in BPH:  1. Neural epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] -like 2 (nel -like 2) (i.e. 6-
fold); 2. Early growth response 1 (i.e. 6-fold); 3. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 10 (i.e. 
5-fold); as well as significant increases in stromal expression of Insulin Growth Factors (IGF -2), 
Insulin Growth Factor Receptors (IGF-I-R), and Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF -2).33, 37  Finally, 
cell signaling genes noted to be more express ed in the prostates of symptomatic BPH patients 
include an increase in v -fos FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (i.e. 13 fold), an 
increase in mitogenic  activated protein kinases (i.e. ERK, p-38), an increase in bcl -2 (anti -
apoptotic factor), and an increase in the cell senescence marker SA -β-gal (epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]).33, 38, [ADDRESS_382394] of 
Tamsulosin or onaBoNT -A on prostate cell s.  Systematic studies of gene expression in prostate 
tissues after treatment with onaBoNT -A or targeted blockade of adrenergic pathways with 
Tamsulosin should help us understand how these agents ameliorate BPH induced symptoms 
and identify better molecular targets to treat LUTS.  Ultimately, the translational goal would be to 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 8 of 32 8/15/18   
provide symptom relief beyond simplistically targeting a reduction in prostate size or relieving 
BOO  since the mechanisms responsible for  either treatment response remains to be 
deter mined.  
 
 
II. PRELIMINARY STUDIES 
 
Clinical:  Our site was one of 7 centers involved in a 12-week Phase II trial of 100 and 300 units 
of onaBoNT -A for the management of BPH (Table 1).40  A total of 134 men were enrolled and 
treated (68 at dose 100 U and 66 at dose 300 U).  One hundred twenty five men provided 
complete primary outcome data (63 at dose 100 U and 62 at dose 300 U).  A positive effect of 
onaBoNT -A was characterized as a ≥ 30% change from baseline in AUA Symptom Score 
(AUASS) and/or Qmax.  Both arms passed the efficacy criteria:  73% passed at the 100 U dose 
and 81% passed at the 300 U dose (Table 1; yellow shading = pass efficacy criteria).  
Interestingly, no significant changes in Total Prostate Volume (TPV) or Transition Zone Volume 
(TZV) in the combined data of 100 U and 300 U (i.e. TPV increased slightly from 49.7 cc to 50.1 
cc and TZV increased 
slightly from 24 cc to 
24.4 cc) were observed.  
In addition, PSA values 
did not change 
significantly as a result 
of onaBoNT -A 
treatment (i.e. 
increased non-
significantly from 2.4-
2.7 at 12 weeks follow -
up).   
 
Our results are consistent with other clinical studies of onaBoNT -A in BPH although the 3-month 
improvements in AUASS (39.1% for 100 U dose; 42.6% for 300 U dose) and Qmax (25.6% and 
28.5%, respectively) demonstrated in our study were smaller than those described in prior 
studies (i.e. AUASS decrease 61-73% and Qmax increase 53-92%).12, 13, 20, 21   
 
A decrease in prostate siz e that is known to occur following physical or chemical (i.e. onaBoNT -
A) denervation in rats was not observed within this study.8, [ADDRESS_382395] that the 
mechanism of action of onaBoNT -A to improve LUTS in men with BPH is multi -factorial and not 
solely related to its effects on altering parasympathetic or sympathetic neural input.  Thus, 
additional directed investigation into the mechanism of action for onaBoNT -A in prostate tissues 
is appropriate, particularly in view of clinical evidence in human bladders that onaBoNT -A 
injection can modulate both the expression of sensory nerve receptors and the release of 
sensory neurotransmitters and nerve growth factor.41-43 
 
Basic: The following experiments were conducted in a rat model to examine the effects of 
chemical denervation (i.e. onaBoNT -A injection) or surgical denervation (i.e. Major Pelvic 
Ganglion (MPG) dissection) on gene expression profiles of different compartments of the 
prostate in a prostate cancer model.  These results are proof of principle that validate our ability 
to measure changes in gene expression of prostatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_310864] -A.  We will use the same methods in human prostate 
tissue to identify genetic changes occurring with BPH/ LUTS development and after successful 
treatment of LUTS with either Tamsulosin or onaBoNT -A. Table 1:  Results of 12 -week Phase II clinical trial    100 Units  300 Units

Reduction of tumor size by [CONTACT_310900]: To determine the functional significance of 
innervation within the prostate and in PCa, we used an orthotopic rat animal model. Transgenic 
mice do not survive the complications caused by [CONTACT_310900] (i.e. neurogenic bladder 
and rectum). The experiments have been performed as a component of the Tumor 
Microenvironment Network. Athymic NIH -RNU rats were denervated mechanically through 
removal of the male pelvic ganglion (MPG). This technique has been widely used in rats 49. Rat 
prostates were also denervated chemically through the use of BOTOX®. VCaP cells were 
injected orthotopi[INVESTIGATOR_310865]. Control 
animals were injected at the same time. Animals were followed for [ADDRESS_382396] that nerves are functionally required for tumor 
growth in this orthotopic rat model. While large tumors were present in 50% of the control arm, 
only 1/8 were identified in the BOTOX® group and 2 in the pelvic ganglion denervation group. 
The tumors were much smaller in the denervated group (Fig. 1). To evaluate gene expression 
changes in normal epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], stromal, and PCa tissues after denervation, we laser -captured 
each cell type and performed RNA expression array analysis. Clus ter analysis showed that 
BOTOX® chemical and physical denervation had similar gene profile effects on all 
compartments studied (Fig. 2). Our results demonstrate that denervation of the prostate has 
profound effects on both the stromal and epi[INVESTIGATOR_310866].

Denervation Effects on Non-Neoplastic [Rat Prostate]  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] : To determine the ef fects of 
denervation on the non-neoplastic epi[INVESTIGATOR_310868] -cancer epi[INVESTIGATOR_310869] t he treated and control animals. We extracted RNA and 
performed gene array studies. Initial gene ontology studies of genes downregulated in the 
denervated animals showed that major cellular processes were affected. These included 
translation and translation initiation factor activity (signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 3, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1, eukaryotic translation elongation 
factor 1 gamma*, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit B, C and F); ribosomes and 
structural constituents of ribosome’s (ribosomal protein L22*, L5, L6, S17 and S6, mitochondrial 
ribosomal protein S14), and metabolic pathways (ST8 alpha-N -acetyl -neuraminide alpha-2,8-
sialyltransferase). Other   genes included proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, alpha type 
5, protein tyrosine phosphatase domain containing 1, tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like 
and EGF -like domains*, heat shock protein 1-like, cAMP responsive element binding protein 1, 
Forkhead box K2 and RING1 and YY1 binding pr otein*.  
 
We validated successfully 12 out of 16 genes, marked previously with a “*”. Validation was done 
on a second laser capture microdissection, as material from the first w as utilized for array 
studies. The histologic translation of these findings is  generalized atrophy, as seen in figure 3.

upregulated genes. Insulin I* and I I* and insulin-like growth factor 1 and insulin-like growth 
factor binding protein 4 were also significantly upregulated. Numerous other growth factors were 
also upregulated including c -fos induced growth factor, connective tissue growth factor as well 
as epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]. Fas ligand (TNF superfamily, member 6) and tumor

identified with stemness properties were also upregulated (noggin, secreted fri zzled -related 
protein 4, wingless -related MMTV integration site 11, dickkopf homolog 4).  
 
Denervation effects on Non-Neoplastic Human Prostate Epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]:   As an initial clinical

prostate cancer enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial examining the effects of onaBoNT -A injections 
on prostate epi[INVESTIGATOR_310873].  Patients received unilateral injection with onaBoNT -A (100 units 
in 1.0 ml) into one transition lobe and a vehicle control injection (i.e. saline) into the contralateral 
lobe.  Examination of tissue from radical prostatectomies performed 4 weeks after injection

and metabolism. The loss  of nerve function induces a pattern of gene expression associated 
survival and wound repair as well as a general atrophic phenotype in all experimental 
denervation conditions.   These studies provide proof of principle that nerves have the ability to 
affect cell growth directly.  
 
Our ability to measure meaningful changes in gene expression profiles in an orthotopic rat 
animal model and in a small group of human patients following chemical denervation with 
onaBoNT -A substantiate the need to apply these same methods to a greater extent in human 
prostate tissue following injection with onaBoNT -A.  Such studies would allow for the 
identification of potential molecular  targets highlighted by [CONTACT_310903] -A effect for future 
investigation.

associated with BPH.  Up to this point, clinical studies using onaBoNT -A in the prostate has 
been limited to patient’s refractory to α -[ADDRESS_382399] α -1 adrenoceptor blockers as frontline therapy in a male veteran 
cohort suffering from moderate to severe LUTS.  Besides its obvious efficacy in patients’ 
refractory to α -1 adrenoceptor blocker therapy, onaBoNT -A injection has several potential 
advantages over oral agents.  Focal prostate injection has been shown to be safe and obviates 
the systemic side effects observed with α -1 adrenoceptor blockers (i.e. orthostatic hypotension, 
sexual dysfunction).  In addition, most clinical studies demonstrate a durable response to 
onaBoNT -A treatment exceeding [ADDRESS_382400] length (i.e. total 4 
years), significant results could drive paradigm shifts in how LUTS associated with BPH is 
treated, even with regards to frontline therapy.  
 
Secondly, although sophisticated molecular techniques (i.e. LCM with Microarray Analysis) have 
been used by [CONTACT_310904], this 
will be the first study examining gene profile changes in BPH patients following treatment with 
the α -[ADDRESS_382401] utilizing expertise across departments that will foster translational work from the 
laboratory to the patient.   Although not the primary goal of this study, we will also search for 
possible biological markers with prognostic value that could be confirmed in a future multi -center 
trial.

V. DRUG INFORMATON 
 
A Botulinum toxin A  is marketed in two pharmaceutical distinct formulations that are not  
equipotent in terms of mouse units. Differences in species sensitivities to different 
botulinum neurotoxin serotypes preclude extrapolation of  animal -dose activity 
relationships to human dose estimates. For the purposes of this study, patients are 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 14 of 32 8/15/18   
treated with the formulation onaBoNT -A which is marketed in the U.S. as BOTOX® 
by [CONTACT_78562]. OnaBoNT -A is a purified neurotoxin complex supplied as a s terile, 
vacuum dried purified botulinum toxin type A, produced from fermentation of 
Clostridium botulinum type A.  
 
One unit of onaBoNT -A corresponds to the calculated median intraperitoneal lethal 
dose (LD 50) in mice. The specific activity of onaBoNT -A is approximately 20 
units/nanogram of neurotoxin protein complex.  
 
BOTOX® is the brand name [CONTACT_310920] -A. For this study’s treatment injections, we 
will be using a total of 200 units of BOTOX® in 4 cc of preservative free normal saline, 
or 4 cc of preservat ive free normal saline for placebo.  
 
BOTOX® blocks neuromuscular transmission by [CONTACT_310906], entering the nerve terminals, and inhibiting the release 
of acetylcholine.  This inhibition occurs as the neurotoxin cleaves SNAP -25, a protein 
integral to the successful docking and release of acetylcholine from vesicles situated 
within nerve endings. When injected intramuscularly at therapeutic doses, BOTOX® 
produces partial chemical denervation of the muscle resulting in a localized reduction 
in muscle activity.  In addition, the muscle may atrophy, axonal sprouting may occur, 
and extra-junctional acetylcholine receptors may develop.  There is evidence that 
reinnervation of the muscle may occur, thus slowly reversing muscle denervation 
produced by [CONTACT_310907]®.  
 
BOTOX® is not expected to be present in the peripheral blood at measurable levels 
following IM or intradermal injection at the recommended doses.  The recommended 
doses of neurotoxin administered at each treatment session are not expected to 
result in systemic, overt distant clinical effects, i.e., muscle weakness, in patients 
without other neuromuscular dysfunction.  However, some clinical systemic effects 
have been shown by a single fiber electromyography after IM doses of botulinum 
toxins appropriate to produce clinically observable local muscle weakness.  
 
BOTOX® is contraindicated in the presence of infection at the proposed injection 
site(s), and in individuals with known hypersensitivity to any ingredient in the 
formulation.  
 
BOTOX® is supplied in a single-use vial.  Each vial contains 100 units of vacuum -
dried Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin components.  
 
Unopened vials of BOTOX® should be stored in a refrigerator (2° to 8° C) for up to 24 
months (or the expi[INVESTIGATOR_310879]).  Administer BOTOX® within four 
hours of reconstitution and within 30 minutes of drawing into syringe; during this 
period the reconstituted BOTOX® should be stored in a refrigerator (2° to 8° C).   
 
Additional BOTOX® information is available in the BOTOX® Prescribing Information 
package insert.  
 
B Tamsulosin, marketed as Flomax®, is an alpha adrenoreceptor -blocker that is used to 
improve symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate ( BPH). It works by [CONTACT_310908].  This may improve urine flow rates and decrease 
urinary symptoms such as hesitancy and urgency.

VIII DESIGN  
 
This Phase 2 clinical research trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel -group study to compare the treatment effects of onaBoNT -A 200 U vers us 0.4 mg 
per day of oral tamsulosin in male veterans diagnosed with moderate to severe LUTS 
(AUASS equal to or greater than 8) associated with BPH.  A total of [ADDRESS_382409]-treatment.  A total of 6 biopsy cores (i.e. 3 cores from the left and right 
transition zone) will be obtained from each volunteer.  Prostate biopsy cores will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_310881]. Gustavo E. 
Ayala's laboratory located at University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center - Houston Medical 
School  for further processing.  
 
A Randomization  
 
Volunteers will be randomized using a blocked randomization approach by [CONTACT_310909]:  ARM 1: onaBoNT -A 200 U prostate 
injection and placebo oral capsule daily or ARM 2: Placebo prostate injection (saline) 
and tamsulosin 0.[ADDRESS_382410], the number of subjects in each treatment group is

− Patient Preparation 
a. Patient is examined and submits urine for urinalysis which is 
examined by [CONTACT_310910] -A 
solution to ensure that no infection is noted or suspected.  
b. Prostate size is measured via transrectal ultrasound on patients 
after receiving a Fleet’s enema the morning of the examination.  
The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position with knees 
tucked against the chest and the transrectal probe introduced.  A 
multi-planar probe that gives a 112° sector image is used to allow 
viewing in both transverse and longitudinal planes without moving 
the probe.  The prostate size is measured initially using the height 
(H), width (W), and length (L) functions available on the ultrasound 
machine.  Scanning of the prostate is carried out in two planes at 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 19 of 32 8/15/[ADDRESS_382417].  The volume is 
calculated as a machine function using the formula H x W x L x 
π/[ADDRESS_382418] copy.   
− OnabotulinumtoxinA  or Saline placebo Injection 
a. Anesthesia is delivered according to the clinical practice of the 
center PI.  Transrectal periprostatic block may be used with a 5 ml 
bolus of 1% lidocaine given just superiolateral to each seminal 
vesicle as visualized using the transrectal sound probe in the 
sagittal plane.  The bolus is given via an appropriately long 22-
gauge needle.  
b. The onabotulinumtoxinA  toxin type A solution is given via the 
same approach using a second needle.   
i. For men randomized to the 200 unit onaBoNT -A arm, 50 units 
per 1.0 ml volume is given at the following points of the 
transitional zone:  left and ri ght inferior and superior 
transitional zone.   
ii. For men randomized to the placebo arm, 1.0ml of saline is 
given at the following points of the transitional zone:  left and 
right inferior and superior transitional zone.   
c. The needle is passed from posterior to anterior through the 
peripheral zone (PZ) into the base of the prostate at the transition 
zone/central zone junction on the left side.  The needle is 
advanced to superior aspect of the transition zone.  
d. Prior to injection of onabotulinumtoxinA  the needle is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_310882].  This is repeated prior to each 
injection.  
e. The initial 1.[ADDRESS_382419] deposited at the superior

the inferior (apex) transit ion zone/central zone junction and the 
second 1.0 ml of solution is deposited on the same side as the 
needle is withdrawn.  
f. The needle is passed from posterior to anterior through the 
peripheral zone (PZ) on the right side into the base of the prostate 
at the transition zone/central zone junction on the left side.  The 
needle is advanced to superior (bladder base) aspect of the 
transition zone.

form.  
i. After the injection, the patient remains in the clinic until a 
spontaneous void has occurred.  
• Subjects will receive an adequate supply of tamsulosin/placebo with 
instructions on dosing.

IX BIOLOGICAL SPECIMENS  
 
A Prostate tissue will be collected at the time biopsy  to conduct gene array studies to 
determine the effects of onaBoNT -A and tamsulosin on the genetic profile of human 
normal and BPH tissues.   The specimens  will be coded and will not include any 
subject identifying information. Testing on the tissue specimens  will be conducted in 
[CONTACT_310923]'s laboratory.   The specimens will be stored until the end of the study at 
which time any unused specimens will be destroyed.  These specimens  will not be 
released to anyone not listed as an investigator on the protocol, nor will they be sold 
or transferred to any third party. If at any time the subject withdraws from this study, 
he will not be able to get the specimens  back.  Upon written request to [CONTACT_84135], the 
stored samples will be destroyed but the data collected up until that time will not be 
deleted.  
 
The gene expression profiles in epi[INVESTIGATOR_310883] -A and saline (i.e. Tamsulosin group),  respectively , will be 
compared.  Pre and post treatment biopsies will be frozen for laser capture 
microdissection and subsequent RNA extraction. All 6 biopsies will be frozen to 
guarantee adequate representation of both epi[INVESTIGATOR_310884].  These sections will be used to orient laser capture microscopy in immediate 
frozen serial sections.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_310885]. Laser captured microdissection (LCM) tissues will be processed for gene 
expression profiling using Agilent Oligo Microarrays.   Samples will be hybridized on a 
4x44K slide formatted with the Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray Kit that 
contains 41,000 unique genes and transcripts. Gene expression profiles will be 
evaluated using BioConductor software that will be used to process and normalize 
data.  Significant differences in mean mRNA levels between groups will be 
determined with two-sided t -tests.  Visualization of data (color maps) will be 
performed using Clus ter and Java TreeView software.  We will search for GO 
annotation terms in gene sets and will establish protein interaction networks analysis 
using the Human Protein Reference Database as we have reported previously and 
visualization will use Cytoscape sof tware. Our next step is always to confirm the array 
analyses using qRT -PCR using pre-designed and validated primers when available. 
Otherwise primers will be designed and validated as described previously in 
numerous publications by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ittmann and our prostate research group. As a result of 
this study we will identify differential gene expression profiles in epi[INVESTIGATOR_310886] -A versus Tamsulosin treated prostates .  In addition, we will be 
able to assess changes in gene expression profile before and after treatment  with 
either agent.  This analysis will permit us to assess whether Tamsulosin and 
onaBoNT -A have similar  effects on human tissues as we have identified in rats.  
These results will serve as substantiation for further human clinical trials.  
 
In addition to determining the effects of o naBoNT -A and tamsulosin on the genetic 
profile of human normal and BPH tissues , another goal is to determine the effects of 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 22 of 32 8/15/18   
Tamsulosin and onaBoNT -A on the human BPH prostate tissue proliferati on, 
apoptosis, innervation, stromal response, and angiogenesis.  
 
1 Apoptosis: The apoptotic rates of normal and BPH epi[INVESTIGATOR_310887], as onaBoNT -A denervation is known to induce apoptosis. For the 
detection of apoptosis in situ will use the TUNEL technique. Apoptotic bodies will 
be counted under a light microscope (x400).  The area with highest positive 
stain within areas of BPH will be selected for counting. The number of apoptotic 
bodies will be determined in a total of approximately 1000 c ells, normalized to 
100 cells and defined as apoptotic index (AI). We expect to see an increase in 
apoptosis with o naBoNT -A compared to tamsulosin treatment.  
 
2 Proliferation: The proliferation rate of BPH cells in human tissues will be 
determined using the immunoperoxidase method with antibodies against Ki -67. 
The proliferation index (PI) will be defined as the ratio of KI -[ADDRESS_382427] positive stain fields (at 
least 2000 cells), using a micros copic grid at 400x magnification. We expect to 
see a decrease in proliferation.  
 
3 Nerves: To measure nerve density in these specimens we will immunostained 
with PGP9.[ADDRESS_382428]. 
 
4 Reactive stroma formation: Previous studies suggest that paracrine stromal 
interactions may be important factors in inducing and maintaining BPH. 
Therefore, we will determine if the stroma shows changes induced by 
[CONTACT_310911] -A. Tissue staining will be evaluated following 
procedures w e have reported previously for quantitative determination of 
expression indexes for reactive stroma markers.  A decrease in the stromal 
reactive response to BPH is expected.  
 
5 Angiogenesis: Angiogenesis and neurogenesis are concomitant processes in 
embryol ogic development and wound response. Therefore we will look at the 
effect of denervation with o naBoNT -A on vessel density using standard vessel 
count methodology . 
 
B Blood samples  collected during the screening visit are routine for patients with BPH 
and LUT S and will be handled according to standard of practice.  The test results will 
be included in the subject's research and medical charts.  
 
C Urine specimens  collected for dipstick analysis  during the screening visit are routine 
for patients with BPH and LUTS  and will be handled according to standard of 
practice.  The test results will be included in the subject's research and medical 
charts.  
 
 
 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 23 of 32 8/15/[ADDRESS_382429] between 
the 2 study groups.     
 
Graphical methods will be used to access distributional properties of the secondary 
endpoints (urinary flow rate, serum PSA, prostate volume symptom relief, post -void 
residual, BPH impact score, Bladder Function, Erectile Function and Ejaculatory Function 
questionnaires) . If extreme departures from normality are found, use of non-parametric 
analytical methods such as the Wilcoxon rank -sum test or transformation of the data will be 
considered.  Questionnaire scores will be examined for reliability using Cronbach’s alpha.  
The distributions of the scores will be examined to see if they are evenly distributed around 
the mid-point of the scales or are clustered at the top or bottom of the scales (ceiling or 
floor effect).  If strong ceili ng or floor effects are found, this could limit the usefulness of 
these measures.  Changes in these secondary endpoints will be assessed using either the 
independent t -test or its non-parametric equivalent, the Wilcoxon rank sum -test.  Statistical 
analysis  will be done using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary NC).  
 
The endpoints  apoptotic index, proliferation index, nerve density, stromal reactive indexes, 
and vessel density, will be checked for their distributional properties  using the methods  
described for the data collected in Aim 1.  Change from baseline to [ADDRESS_382430] given evidence within the BPH literature and our own experience with

deviation of 6.3 for both groups. Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 29 
subjects per group will achieve 90% power to detect a difference of 5.[ADDRESS_382432]. Sample size calculations were done using 
PASS 200 8 software (Hintze, J.  (2008).  NCSS, LLC.  Kaysville, Utah.  www.ncss.com).  
  
The drop-out rate in the alpha-blocker study was as large as 20% and our own exper ience 
with onabotulinumtoxinA (onaBoNT -A) in the MIST -2 trial has demonstrated a dropout rate 
of 14%.  So adjusting our sample size for an expected dropout rate of 20%, we will enroll 
[ADDRESS_382433].  
 
 
XII. RETENTION AND DROPOUT/WITHDRAWAL  
 
Minimal dropout or loss to follow -up is expected in this cohort, especially given the short 
follow -up.  However, if a patient drops out before 4 weeks, he will be replaced so that the 
required sample size is realized. For purposes of tracking the feasibility of conducting a 
trial of treatment with o naBoNT -A, reasons for dropout or withdrawal will be documented.  
 
 
XIII. CRITERIA FOR DIS CONTINUING THE STUDY  
 
A Subjects unable to tolerate [tamsulosin or]  onaBoNT -A due to side effects.  
B Subjects can request removal from the study for any reason at any time.  
C Subjects may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety,  
compliance, or other reasons.  
 
A discontinuation occurs when an enrolled subject ceases participation in the study, 
regardless of the circumstances, prior to completing the protocol.  
 
The reasons for a subject discontinuing from the study will be recorded in the Case Report 
Form.

between the study subjects groups will be evaluated using the paired-samples t -tests. The 
clinical outcomes will be compared using Fisher’s test. The criterion for significance (alpha) 
has been set at 0.05.  All tests are 2-tailed, which means that an effect in either direction 
will be interpreted. Analysis will be conducted using SPSS 17.0. (“SPSS Statistics 17.0”, 
SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, 2008).  
 
 
XV. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS   
 
A BOTOX ®:  It is expected that some participants may have some or all of the following 
side effects when given BOTOX®. Other side effects may occur which were not seen 
before. Side effects are usually temporary and manageable. However, it is possible 
they could cause serious disease or death. The study may include risks that are 
unknown at this time.  
 
There have been rare reports of serious and/or immediate or even deadly abnormally 
sensitive reactions after treatment with BOTOX. These reactions include allergic 
reaction, skin rash, itching, swelling, and difficulty in breathing.  
 
It is a rare possibility that the injection of BOTOX® could lead to botulism. The classic 
symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, droopi[INVESTIGATOR_17775], slurred 
speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. The doctor's 
examination may reveal that the gag reflex and the deep tendon reflexes like the 
knee jerk are decreased or absent.  
 
There have been rare reports of sudden death, sometimes associated with difficulty in 
swallowing or pneumonia. There have also been rare reports of heart problems 
(including irregular heart beats and heart attack, some resulting in death). Some of 
these patients were already at risk for heart disease. It is not known if BOTOX 
actually caused these problems.  
 
It should not be used when infection is present at the injection site or in people known 
to be abnormally sensitive to BOTOX.  
 
The following events have been observed since it has been marketed: skin rash, 
itching, and allergic reaction. In general, thes e side effects occur within the first week 
following injection and, while usually temporary, they may last several months. Pain, 
tenderness, or bruising around the injection site may also occur. Local weakness of 
the injected muscle(s) is expected. Weaknes s of nearby [CONTACT_310912].  
 
There are also possible risks of urinary retention, fecal incontinence and infection as 
a result of intraprostatic onabotulinumtoxinA  injection.  
 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 26 of 32 8/15/18   
BOTOX contains albumin, which comes from human blood. Although the blood is 
rigorously tested, there is an extremely remote risk for the transmission of viruses and 
similar infectious agents.  
 
B Flomax ®: Possible side effects of FLOMAX may include:  
 
Flomax  capsules may cause a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing, 
especially after the first dose or when changing doses.   Symptoms may include 
fainting, dizzin ess, and lightheadedness .  
 
Allergic reactions may include rash, itching, and hives. Rare and more serious allergic 
reactions may also include swelling of face, tongue, or throat , and difficulty breathing.   
 
Priapis m (a painful erection that will not go away ) may occur .  
 
During cataract surgery, a condition called intra-operative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) 
can happen if FLOMAX is being taken or has been taken in the past.   
 
Common side effects  of FLOMAX capsules m ay include runny nose, dizziness, and 
decreased semen.  
 
Adverse experiences with Lidocaine®  are, in general, dose-related and may result 
form high plasma levels caused by [CONTACT_310913], rapid absorption or inadvertent 
intravascular injection, or may res ult from a hypersensitivity, idiosyncrasy or 
diminished tolerance on the part of the patient.   
 
Central nervous system symptoms that may be experienced are lightheadedness, 
nervernousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus , 
blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold or numbness, twitching, 
tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respi[INVESTIGATOR_310888].   
 
Cardiovascular manifestations are usually depressant and are characterized by 
[CONTACT_310914], hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, which may lead to cardiac 
arrest.  
 
Allergic reactions are characterized by [CONTACT_310915], urticaria, edema, or 
anaphylactoid reactions.  These reactions to Lidocaine are extremely rare.  
 
C Lidocaine®  
 
Adverse experiences with Lidocaine® are, in general, dose-related and may result

D Antibiotic  
1 Bactrim DS may cause allergic reactions: hives, difficult breathing, and swelling 
of face, lips, tongue, or throat.  It may also cause diarrhea, pale skin, rapid heart 
rate, trouble concentrating, sudden weakness, fever, chills, new or worsening 
cough, vomiting, headache, jaundice, skin rash.  
[ADDRESS_382436] pulse, dizziness, 
pale skin, feeling shaky, sweating, unusual hunger, trembling,  headaches, 
irritability, unusual anxiety, ten dinitis , and changes in sensation and nerve 
damage.  
 
E Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS): The ultrasound rarely results in physical discomfort 
but some anxiety before and during the procedure may be experienced.  
 
F Blood Draw : Inserting needles into veins for collecting blood may be uncomfortable.  
Risks include slight bruising at the injection site, fainting, the formation of a small 
blood clot or swelling of the vein and surrounding tissue, bleeding from the site, and 
the remote possibility of infection at the site of the needle puncture.  Fainting is 
usually harmless, of short duration, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_310889], 
sweating, slowing of the heart rate and an abnormal decrease in blood pressure. 
Care wil l be taken to avoid these complications.  
 
G Questionnaires :  Completing the questionnaires may cause the subject to have or to 
experience some level of emotional discomfort due to the personal nature of the 
questions.  The study doctor and staff will maintai n a professional and caring attitude 
while administering the questionnaires.  
 
H Loss of Confidentiality : The loss of confidentiality regarding research information is a 
possibility; although, the risk is very small.  
 
I Birth Control :  Because of the theoretical possibility of diffusion of onabotulinumtoxinA  
into seminal fluid, and no evidence to the contrary, those patients who engage in 
sexual intercourse are required to use condoms for [ADDRESS_382437] : Patients with LUTS should see a benefit to onaBoNT -A injection within one 
week after injection.  This may be manifested by a decrease in AUA symptom scores 
and an increase in urinary flowrate.  
 
B Society : A secondary  benefit of this study is to society because we will gain insight 
into the molecular changes in BPH and bladder  tissues induced by [CONTACT_310916] -A 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 28 of 32 8/15/18   
injection.  The results of this study could potentially lead to novel treatments for BPH 
and LUTS . 
 
C Risk to Benefit Ratio:  The risks of the injection are minimal (i.e. bleeding, i nfection) 
and are mitigated in this protocol (i.e. no blood thinner medications, peri -injection 
antibiotics).  The benefit of offering novel, minimally invasive treatments for BPH and 
LUTS far exceed the risk of prostate injection.  
 
XVII.   ALT ERNAT IVES  
 
The alternative to participating in this research study is watchful waiting, medical therapy 
with approved drugs , or surgical treatment .   
 
 
XVIII.  COSTS TO SUBJECTS  
 
Other than the study investigative products  and anesthesia, all events and procedures are 
considered standard of care for this patient population.  
 
 
XIX. PAYMENT TO SUBJECTS 
 
Subjects will not receive payment for participating in this study.  
 
 
XX. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   
 
Adverse Events will be reported in accordance to all applicable FDA, ICH, and IRB rules, 
regulations, and guidelines.   
 
 
XXI. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 
A Case Report Forms  
 
B Protocol -specific data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs). The completed 
dataset should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for 
authorized repr esentatives of appropriate Health/Regulatory Authorities, without 
written permission from BCM.  
 
C Record Retention 
 
D To enable evaluations and/or audits from Health Authorities/BCM, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all partic ipating patients (sufficient 
information to link records; e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent 
forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_310890]’s, and detailed records of drug disposition.  To comply with 
international regulations, the records should be r etained by [CONTACT_137473].  
 
 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 29 of 32 8/15/[ADDRESS_382438] be carried out in compliance with the protocol and the princi ples of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in accordance with International Conference on  
Harmoni sation (ICH)  Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the US [ADDRESS_382439] (IRB) and Other Institutional Review Committees  
 
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form 
and other information to subjects, must be reviewed by a properly constituted and 
other institutional review committees, as required.  A signed and dated statement that 
the protocol and informed consent document(s) have been approved by [CONTACT_310917] a general correspondence submission.  
 
B Informed Consent Process  
 
Subjects will be identified from those visiting in the Urology clinic at MEDVAMC. The 
investigator or his designated personnel must explain to each subject (or legally 
authorized representative) the nature of the s tudy, its purpose, the procedures 
involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved and any 
discomfort it may entail. Each subject must be informed that participation in the study 
is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time and that 
withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or 
relationship with the treating physician. Informed consent will be obtained in every 
patient prior to performing a biopsy or any protocol -related procedures or tests.  
 
This informed consent should be given by [CONTACT_3553] a standard written statement, 
written in non-technical language. The subject should read and consider the 
statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy of the signed 
document. If the subject cannot read or sign the documents, oral presentation may be 
made or signature [CONTACT_89447] [CONTACT_423]’s legally appointed representative, if 
witnessed by a person not involved in the study, mentioning that the patient could not 
read or  sign the documents. No patient can enter the study before his informed 
consent has been obtained. The original signed informed consent form will be kept 
with the research study documents  and a signed copy will be given to the subject.  
 
C Confidentiality  
 
Each subject will be assigned a unique, consecutive three-digit identification number 
(i.e., 001, 002, …). The study number will be utilized for identification of the subject 
throughout the study. The clinical study coordinator of the trial will maintain the code 
that links the name [CONTACT_310921]. The study 
coordinator will maintain the code in a secured cabinet and the code will be kept 
confidential. Only the clinical study coordinator and principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310891].  
 
 
CPS BT X + Ta m  Page 30 of 32 8/15/[ADDRESS_382440] 
until after IRB approval has been given.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_310892].   
 
Revisions to questionnaires or CRFs will not require IRB; therefore, these revisions 
will not be reported.

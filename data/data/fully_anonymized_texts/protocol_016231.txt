1. STUDY RATIONALE  
Intracranial atherosclerotic arterial stenosis (ICAS) is an important cause of stroke in the US , and is especially 
prevalent in b lacks, Asians , and Hispanics.1-[ADDRESS_95363] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87488]:  The WASID trial showed that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87489],  
and the SAMMPRIS  trial showed that aggressive medical management  (AMM) consisting of dual antiplatelet 
therapy and intensive risk factor management  was more effective than percutaneous transluminal stenting  for 
preventing stroke in recently symptomatic subjects with ICAS.7-9 However, among high-risk subjects  (those 
with severe [70 -99%] stenosis  who presented with a stroke [rather than a TIA]) , the 1 -yr rate  of recurrent stroke  
was 20.7%  despi[INVESTIGATOR_87490]. 10 Therefore, more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87491]-risk patients remain s an urgent need .  
One promising novel treatment is remote limb ischemic conditioning (RLIC), which involves producing 
repetitive, transient, non -injurious ischemia of a limb by [CONTACT_57094] a blood pressure cuff proximally with the 
intention of protecting a distal organ (in this case, the brain) from subsequent ischemia.11 One of the co -
investigators  in our group ([CONTACT_87528] at the Medical College of Georgia (MCG)) has conducted pre -
clinical studies using a bilateral carotid artery stenosis mouse model that showed RLIC increases cerebral 
blood flow (CBF) , most likely by [CONTACT_87514],  and acts as a powerful neuroprotectant 
and vasculoprotectant.12-15  Additionally, two pi[INVESTIGATOR_83021] s performed in China showed that 
symptomatic subjects  with ICAS treated with  bilateral upper extremity  RLIC  daily for 180 or 300 days and 
medical management had a 70 -75% lower rate of stroke compared with subjects  treated with medical 
management  alone .16,[ADDRESS_95364] preliminary data on the potential mechanisms of action of RLIC in humans, we will 
perform a small multicenter randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_87492] 10 subjects with ICAS at 4 participating sites 
(MUSC, MCG, UCLA and the University of Southern [LOCATION_004] (USC)) to accomplish the following primary 
aims :  
(1) Estimate the variability in CBF (measured by [CONTACT_87515]) and levels of putative 
biomarkers of the conditioning response (vasodilatory, inflammatory, fibrinolytic, microRNA ) in the two 
treatment groups at enrollment and a fter 30 days  of treatment . 
(2) Compare the changes in CBF and putative blood biomarkers of the conditioning response from enrollment 
to 30 days between the two treatment groups .  
(3) Obtain preliminary feasibility, tolerability and adherence data on the use of a RLIC  device for 
secondary stroke prevention in subject s with ICAS .  
This study will provide preliminary data to enable planning of  a subsequent grant submission to NIH to perform 
a Phase I / II trial with the following goals: to provide more rigorous data on the  mechanisms of action of RLIC , 
and to determine the potential efficacy of RLIC for preventing stroke  in high-risk subjects with ICAS . Our 
ultimate goal is to perform a large randomized multicenter NIH-funded  Phase III trial to determine the efficacy 
of RLIC for preventing stroke.  
 
 4 3. OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN  
The design of the study is illustrated in Figure 1 below. In this prospective randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , 10 eligible 
high-risk subjects with ICAS will be randomized to RLIC (bilateral upper extremity (BUE) daily for 30 days ) plus 
AMM  (n=5) or AMM alone (n=5). The AMM , which will be started at study enrollment and continued until close -
out in all subjects,  will consist of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 325 mg per day, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg per day , and risk factor 
management primarily targeting a systolic BP < 140 mmHg and LDL cholesterol < 70 mg /dl. All subjects will 
undergo baseline brain arterial spin labeling (ASL) and perfusion MRI to measure CBF and have blood drawn 
for biomarkers 3-[ADDRESS_95365] RLIC treatment that 
will be done prior to randomization to determine the subjects ’ tolerability to RLIC treatment  (see section [ADDRESS_95366] ). The perio d of [ADDRESS_95367] of 4 cycles of  5-minute inflations of both blood pressure 
cuffs simultaneously to a pressure  of 200 mm Hg with 5  minutes of reperfusion between each inflation  using 
the Doctormate device (see Figure 2). All subjects will return for their close -out visits [ADDRESS_95368] blood drawn for biomarkers  at that visit. 
The study will be conducted at 4 sites (MUSC, MCG, UCLA, USC) to ena ble us to evaluate the consistency of 
CBF measurements across multiple sites and to ensure that the recruitment target of [ADDRESS_95369] SELECTION C RITERIA  
The Target Population are subjects between 30 – 90 years of age with stroke within the previous 30 days that 
is attributed to 70 -99% atherosclerotic stenosis of a major intracranial artery (carotid, middle cerebr al, vertebral 
or basilar) . The full inclusion and exclusion criteria are similar to the SAMMPRIS trial 8 (referred to in section 1 
above ) with the following exceptions: 1) Subjects with TIA will be excluded  because of their excellent outcome 
on AMM in SAMMPRIS.10 2) The upper age limit in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_74489] 90 rather than 80, given the positive response to 
RLIC in octogenarians in the 2nd Chinese trial.17 3) CT angiography (CTA)  or magnetic resonance angiography 
(MRA) measurements of  70-99% intracranial stenosis will b e sufficient for enrollment in this study, whereas 
catheter angiography was required in SAMMPRIS. (C atheter angiography is expensive and has some risk that 
is difficult  to justify in a medical management trial). 4) Diabetic subjects taking sulfonylureas wi ll be excluded 
because these drugs block ATP -sensitive potassium channels that are thought to play a key role in the 
protective effect of RLIC.18  The full inclusion and exclusion criteria for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_87493].

a SBP of [ADDRESS_95374]  can tolerate the screening treatment and wishes to participate in the trial, the coordinator will 
email the study statistician at MUSC who will provide the randomized  treatment assignment  by [CONTACT_6968] .  
 
6. RLIC DEVICE AND ISCHEMIC CONDITIONING REGIMEN  
The RLIC device  in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]  (called Doctorma te) will be donated by [CONTACT_87517][INVESTIGATOR_7602] . [CONTACT_87528] ( co-investigator in this study ) obtained  an amendment to an existing 
IDE approval from the FDA (G140239 ) to use this device in a small IRB -approved pi[INVESTIGATOR_87495] 
 
 7 MUSC in late 2015. The purpose of that pi[INVESTIGATOR_87496]. 
In that study, 4 subjects with symptomatic ICAS (1 at MUSC, 3 at MCG) were tre ated with daily BUE RLIC ( 4 
cycles of  5-minute inflations to a pressure  of 200 mm Hg with 5  minutes of reperfusion between each inflation ) 
for [ADDRESS_95375] 
pain (unrelated to active treatment). Subsequent measurements of blood pressure and pulses in both arms 
were similar. The subject was willing to continue tr eatment but, because this was a preliminary feasibility study, 
[CONTACT_87529] decided not to continue the subject’s treatment to 30 
days. The 3 subjects enrolled at MCG tolerated the treatment well 
with 30 -day treatment adherence rates of 100%, 90% and 85% . Drs. 
Chimowitz and Hess have also personally used the RLIC device 
daily for 14 days (see Figure 2) and were easily able to tolerate the 
mild symptoms produced by [CONTACT_8235] (paresth esia, mild 
cyanosis of fingers). [CONTACT_87530] has now applied to the FDA to  extend 
the IDE approval to cover the pi[INVESTIGATOR_87497] .  
 
Rationale for the RLIC regimen in this study . Each daily bilateral 
upper extremity RLIC treatment will consist of 4 cycles of  5-minute 
inflations of both blood pressure cuffs simultaneously to a pressure  
of 200 mm Hg with 5  minutes of reperfusion between each inflation  
using the Doctormate device (see Figure 2). The selection of [ADDRESS_95376] shown that 4 to 6 cycles of 5 -minute 
durations appear optimal.21 Using 4 cycles instead of 5 cycles (the regimen used in the Chine se trials 16,17) will 
lessen the total duration of each treatment from [ADDRESS_95377] use of 
RLIC , and a  preclinical study  (in a mouse model) shows that the increased CBF after RLIC is sustained to [ADDRESS_95378] of care 
recommended by [CONTACT_87518].22 This consists of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 325 mg per day, 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75 mg per day) and intensive risk factor management targeting a syst olic blood pressure < 140 mm 
HG, an LDL cholesterol < 70 mg /dl , non -HDL cholesterol < 100mg/dl, smoking cessati on, and hemoglobin A1c 
< 7% in diabetics.   
 
8. BLOOD BIOMARKER MEASUREMENTS   
The blood biomarkers that will be measured are putative biomarkers of RLIC  23-[ADDRESS_95379] of : Nitrite, IL -10, SDF1, Micro RNA 144, Lp -PLA2, IL -6, hsCRP, Soluble 
E-selectin, ICAM, MMP -9, PAI -1, tPA, and ADMA. We will measure the  blood biomarkers at baseline  and 
close -out (33-35 days after enrollment) in all [ADDRESS_95380]. David 
Hess, a Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_87498] (center)   

 
 8 9. MRI MEASUREMENTS OF CBF AND OTHER PERFUSION PARAMETERS  
ASL MRI will be used to provide quantitative measurements of CBF  in all 10 subjects in the study (at baseline 
and at close -out). 32,[ADDRESS_95381]  already tested the feasibility of using our planned  ASL MRI protocol  unde r a 
MCG / UCLA IRB -approved protocol. Six subjects  with recent  stroke from ICAS  underwent ASL MRI before 
and after one RLIC treatment , a mean of 4.[ADDRESS_95382] 1  
cycle of RLIC , these subjects  showed mean increases of CBF of 8% -28% in the MCA and PCA territories on 
the infarct side vs. the normal side.  While quantitative CBF obtained with ASL MRI is  the primary MR outcome  
in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , we will also utilize dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced  perfusion MR imaging (DSC -PWI)  to 
assess the effectiveness of secondary brain perfusion parameters (such as cerebral blood volume and 
cerebrovascular trans it times).    
10. ASSESSMENT OF FEASIBILITY, TOLERABILITY AND ADHERENCE TO RLIC  
Enrolled subjects randomized to the RLIC group will take the Doctormate device home and use it daily for the 
next [ADDRESS_95383]  weekly up until the close -out visit to document any 
problems with the device or any adverse events using a questionnaire (see Appendix 1). The subject will also 
be asked to keep a daily diary for the 30 days the Doctormate device is used (see appendix 2.)  The device 
records when it is used and whether the treatment was completed so when the subject returns for the close -out 
visit, w e will be able assess adherence to use of the device.   
11. RANDOMIZATION, BLINDING, AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
Subjects will be rand omized 1:[ADDRESS_95384] that controls for 
moderate imbalances at the site level. All study  data will be entered directly by [CONTACT_87519] [INVESTIGATOR_87499] . Initial data 
checking will be performed by [CONTACT_87520].  When 
the data are transferred to the study bi ostatistician  for analysis and report  generation, further data quality 
checks will be conducted by [CONTACT_78718]. Study data will be retained on a secure server at  the Department of Public 
Health Sciences  at MUSC .  
12. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
To estimate the variability in CBF and biomarkers, all of which  are continuous measures, simple summary 
statistics will be reported for the baseline and close -out measurements in each group. With five imaging 
samples per group, the precision of the 90% confidence interval around the mean would be ± 0.95 for a SD of 
1, and, as an example, would increase to ± 7.63 for a SD of 8. We will also evaluate the changes in CBF and 
biomarkers from baseline to close -out in the two groups using  means and 90% confidence intervals.  Here, the 
precision of the resulting confidence inte rval is ± 9.4 when the SD is 8; that is, if RLIC yields a mean 10% 
change in CBF and sham RLIC yields a mean 0% change in CBF the resulting 90% confidence interval is (0.6, 
19.4) for the difference in percent change in CBF. Finally, with a sample size of N =5, we will be able to 
estimate the correlation between CBF and biomarkers for each arm with an 90% confidence interval of 0.5 ( -
0.5, 0.9) in the case of an observed moderate correlation.  Interpretation of the summary statistics will be 
complimented with g raphical approaches including boxplots to assess distributions within treatment arms, and 
funnel plots to assess differences at the site level.  
 
13.  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Risks to the Subjects:  The risks of the Doctormate device might include discomfort, numbness or tingling in 
the hands and arms whe n the device is inflated , and a warm  feeling when it is deflated. The device may als o 
cause bruising in the arm or petechiae . There is also the theoretical possibility of a small risk of a venous cl ot 
 
 [ADDRESS_95385] s over age 80 used the Doctormate 
device twice per day  on both arms for 6 months  and the following risks were noted in that trial: “ Transient 
sporadic petechiae were observed in [ADDRESS_95386] 30 days of th e study, but disappeared soon after 
without discontinuing treatment. No ecchymosis, tenderness to palpation, edema, skin breakage, or other skin 
lesions were observed. No deep vein thromboses were detected by [CONTACT_87521]  180 days of treatment”.[ADDRESS_95387] within 24 hours.  
The risks related to participation in this trial are related to the a) RLIC device; b) MRI scan; c) phlebotomy; d.) 
medications associated with AMM; and e) loss of confidentiality.  
a.) Device related. Although we don’t anticipate any serious adverse events rel ated to the RLIC device 
based on experience with the same device in two Chinese trials 16,[ADDRESS_95388] for monitoring adverse events (see Protection 
Against Risk below). The risks that are possibly anticipated with the RLIC device include:  
 Petechiae on the arm  
 Skin rash or hypersensitivity to the cuff  
 Thrombosis of veins in arm  
 Swelling of the arm  
 Pain and discomfort in the arm  
 Muscle or nerve injury in the arm  
 
b.) The risks that  are associate with MRI include  
 Claustrophobia and anxiety from the MRI  
 
c.) The risks associated with phlebotomy are  
 Discomfort or bruising of an arm from venipuncture required for biomarkers and routine blood 
tests  
 
d.) All of the medications used in this study (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87500]) have been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the conditions for which 
they will be prescribed in this study and are not inve stigational. The major side effects of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87501]. Other possible side effects of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87502], 
ringing in the ears, nausea and vomiting. The most common side effects of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87503], 
bruisi ng, itching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal discomfort. A less common but more serious 
side effect of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87504]. The most serious side effect of 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87236] a clotting disorder called thrombotic th rombocytopenic purpura (TTP) but this is very rare 
(1 in 15,000 -20,000 treated subjects). The  combination of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87505] 
90 days after stroke or TIA in patients with intracranial stenosis following the SAMMPRIS trial 9 and will 
be prescribed for the duration  that subjects participate in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (33-35 days) . The combination 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87506] a ssociated with a significantly higher risk of major  bleeding compared with 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87507] . The r isks associated with statin therapy are a persistent increase in liver 
enzymes (0.0 - 0.4%), myalgia (2.8%), muscle weakness with increase in CK levels > 10 x upper limit 
of normal (0.03 - 0.1%), and rarely rhabdomyolysis that can potentially lead to renal  failure. The risks 
associated with antihypertensive medications include hypotension, dizziness, headaches, weakness, 
 
 10 allergic reactions, diarrhea, hypokalemia or hyperkalemia depending on the type of blood pressure 
medication taken, cough (with ACE inhibi tors), and angioedema (ACE inhibitors).  
 
e.) There is the risk of loss of confidentiality  
 
The principles of Informed Consent, according to FDA Regulations and ICH guidelines on GCP, will be 
followed . All subjects must provide informed consent to participate and only the participant can provide 
informed consent, which must be cosigned by a study investigator. Once a subject’s eligibility has been 
confirmed by [CONTACT_55794], the subject will be approached to participate in the trial. The consent form 
includes a section describing a screening process whereby [CONTACT_87522] [ADDRESS_95389] Risk  
The research coordinator will call subjects randomized to the RLIC group weekly and will use a standardized 
questionnaire to ask subjects about adverse events (see Appendix 1). For the pain question, we will utilize a 
visual analog pain scale of 0 to 10 an d provide this to the subjects randomized to the RLIC group. At the 
weekly phone call, the research coordinator will ask the degree of pain using this scale. If the score is > 2, the 
site investigator will be notified and will contact [CONTACT_87523]. 
Additionally, If the subject answers “yes” to any other questions, we will ask the subject to come in to be 
examined.   If we suspect a venous thrombosis because of swelling or pain, we will perform a venous 
ultrasound to  rule out a deep venous thrombosis. We will also obtain the phone number of a relative or friend in 
order to reach the subject if we have trouble reaching the subject.  All subjects will be given  the telephone 
numbers of the principal site neurologist and site coordinator to report any clinical events or to ask questions 
about the study.  
Subjects who are claustrophobic will not be en rolled in this study . To reduce the risk of phlebotomy, only 
trained phlebotomists will perform venipuncture. All neuroimaging and biomarker data will be de -identified as 
stated under “Sources of Material”. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_87508]. All these measures will ensure against loss of 
confidentiality.  
 
Side effects of any medications prescribed to subjects as part of routine care of subjects with intracranial 
stenosis will also be monitored. These side effects will be minimized by [CONTACT_87524] -coated 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], checking liver enzymes and CK for subjects on a statin if clinically indicated, and instituting appropriate 
treatment should side effects arise.  
 
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and O thers .  Subject s enrolled in this study 
may benefit from the increased medical supervision that occurs by [CONTACT_4907]; however, no 
benefit from this supervision or the RLIC treatment can be guaranteed. If RLIC is indeed effect ive as 
suggested in the previous Chinese trial s, 16,[ADDRESS_95390] risk stroke -prone conditions.   
Importance of the Knowledge to be G ained .  The risk of recurrent stroke in patients with ICAS  is very high, 
about 20% at one year even with aggressive medical management (AMM). 10 RLIC has the potential to reduce 
this risk of stroke and avoid disability for patients with ICAS  based on the preliminary trial s performed in China. 
16,17 Since the anticipated risks of RLIC are low, these risks are reasonable in relation to the importance of the 
knowledge that will be gained from this study.  This study will provide key pi[INVESTIGATOR_87509] a subsequent larger NIH-funded  
 
 11 multicenter Phase I / II trial that will provide more rigorous data on the mechanisms of action of RLIC and the 
potential efficacy of RLIC in preventing stroke in these subjects. If t hese two goals are achieved in the Phase  I 
/ II trial, we will submit another grant to NIH to fund a definitive large multicenter Phase III trial to establish the 
efficacy of RLIC for subjects with ICAS. If that planned trial is positive for RLIC, it will lead to a new treatment 
for this common and high -risk disease and will provide a strong rationale to test RLIC for related conditions 
such as patients with extracranial carotid stenosis and patients with vascular cognitive impairment  
Safety Monitoring.  Fenwick Nichols MD, Professor of Neurology at the Medical College of Georgia , will serve 
as the Safety Officer.  [CONTACT_87531] has over [ADDRESS_95391] trial of minocycline in acute 
ischemic stroke conducted at the Medical College of Georgia , and two other sites.  All adverse events (AE)  and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to [CONTACT_87531] and the site’s IRB within [ADDRESS_95392] enrollment in this trial that results in any of the following: (1) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_87510] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; (b) persistent or significant disability/incapacity; (c) death of the study 
subject, or (d) necessitates an intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or permanent 
damage to a body structure . [CONTACT_87531] will make a determination of whether a n AE or SAE in any way is  
related to the Doctormate  device.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] : If the Safety  Officer determines that an SAE  is defini tely related to the device , the study will be 
stopped and a review will be co nducted by [CONTACT_87525] , who will 
determine whether enrollment in the study can be restarted .   Since there are only 10 subjects that will be 
enrolled in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], this decision to restart enrollment c annot be based on a formal statistical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10035]. Instead it will be based on a clinical impression of likely harm to subjects from continuing ischemic 
conditioning, which the evidence from much larger completed trials of ischemic conditioning in subje cts  with 
coronary and intracranial occlusive disease suggests is very unlikely. 16,17,35

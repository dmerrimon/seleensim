 2. INTRODUCTION  
 
The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases nearly exponentially as a 
function of age beyond the third decade of life 1. Patients diagnosed with de novo AML 
who are older than 55 years and receive intensive induction chemotherapy experience 
complete remission (CR) rates of approximately 50%, median survivals of 6 -12 months, 
and 5 year survivals of 5 -10%. Outcomes are poor even for patients who achieve CR 
and receive intensive consolidation therapy; the median survivals are approximately 10 -
12 months 2-6. The feasibility of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) to 
improve relapse -free survival in patients with AML in this older age group has 
traditionally been limited by [CONTACT_450416] -related mortality (TRM) due to 
toxicities from typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], intense conditioning regimens7,8. More recently, we have explored 
a minimally toxic nonmyeloablative preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine (90 
mg/m2) and low -dose total body irradiation (TBI; 2 Gy), which permits al logeneic 
engraftment and depends on graft -vs.-leukemia (GVL) effects for eliminating residual 
leukemic cells 9-12. We observed long -term disease -free survival in a significant 
proportion of older patients with AM L given either related or unrelated donor HCT 13,14, 
treated on Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Protocols 1225, 1406, 1463, 1533, 
1591, 1596, 1641, 1654, 1668, 1732, 1813, 1898, 1938 and 1959. However, a major 
cause of failure of this approach has been leukemia relapse, seen in 43% of patients at 
[ADDRESS_574028] leukemic 
cells and, thereby, minimizing the relapse risk. Patients older than 55 years with AML in 
morphologic leukemia -free state will be eligible for this study. Younger patients with  
comorbid conditions excluding them from conventional high -risk conditioning regimens 
will also be eligible. The efficacy part of the study will be preceded by a dose finding 
part, aimed at determining the optimal clofarabine dose. Monitoring for minimal r esidual 
disease (MRD) after HCT will be rigorous, using immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and 
molecular methods. Finally, clofarabine might be less immunosuppressive than 
fludarabine, and graft rejection beyond the historical rate of 5% might become an issue. 
Therefore, graft rejection will be monitored and the TBI dose increased by 1 Gy if more 
than 5% graft rejection is seen.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_450352], with a median patient age of 67 years at 
diagnosis, according to Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_450353] (SEER) statistics. 
Approximately 35 -80% of adult patients with de novo AML achieve complete remissions 
when treated with induction therapy 15,16. These remissions are rarely durab le and 
additional therapy is needed for long -term relapse -free survival. Based on a study from 
the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, multiple cycles of high -dose cytarabine have

Figure 1. Overall Survival, Relapse/Progression and Non -relapse Mortality rates 
in patients with AML (n=274) undergoing non -myeloablative allogeneic HCTbecome the standard consolidation therapy for patients with favorable and intermedi ate 
cytogenetic risks under the age of 60 years 17. The biology of AML in the elderly 
appears to differ from that of younger patients, with an increased incidence of 
antecedent dysplasia, poor prognosis karyotypes, and multidrug resistant glycop rotein 
MDR1 18-21. Furthermore, patients over the age of 60 years and those with comorbid 
conditions are usually treated with less intense regimens due to their inability to tolerate 
multiple cycles of high -dose chemotherapy, resulting in low, approximately 10 -15% long 
term survival rates 5,22,22. A recent retrospective analy sis including 2,444 patients with 
AML, 60 years or older, treated on several SWOG, ECOG and M.D. Anderson protocols 
between 1976 and 2004 reported a 5 -year overall survival rate of about 5%23. 
Allogeneic HCT using conventional high -dose conditioning regimens represents a post -
remission therapy option with curative potential; however, these regimens are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_450417] -related morbidity and mortality in older 
patients or those with comorbid conditions.  
 
Nonmyeloa blative HCT for patients with AML  
The development of nonmyeloablative and reduced -intensity conditioning regimens has 
enabled older and medically infirm patients with myeloid malignancies to undergo 
allogeneic HCT. A number of studies of reduced -intensity conditioning followed by 
[CONTACT_450418] -identical siblings or HLA -matched unrelated donors have 
been published 24-28.  
 
Among the largest studies is that from the FHCRC/Seattle Consortium, which  has been 
recently updated 14. The study included 274 patients (median age: 60 years) with de 
novo or secondary AML who underwent allogeneic HCT from related (n=118) or 
unrelated donors (n=156) after conditioning with 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) with or 
without fludarabine (90 mg/m2) on FHCRC protocols. A calcineurin inhibitor and MMF 
were used for postgrafting immunosuppression. With a median follow -up of 38 months 
in surviving patients, the estimated 
5-year overall survival, 
relapse/progression and non -
relapse mortality (NRM) rates were 
33%, 42% and 26%, respectively 
(Figure 1 ). Patients in first and 
second complete remission had 
better survivals than patients with 
more advanced disease (37% and 
34% vs. 18%, respectively). 
Patients with HLA -matched related 
or unrelated donors had similar 
survivals. Advanced disease stage 
and un favorable cytogenetics were 
associated with increased relapse 
and mortality. Chronic GVHD was 
associated with lower relapse risk.

remained the major cause of 
treatment failur e after HCT. Most 
relapses occurred early after HCT; the 
median time to relapse was 84 days. 
The 6 -month and 1 -year relapse rates 
were 31% and 35%, respectively. 
Relapses occurring beyond [ADDRESS_574035] may provide time for potent GVL effects to develop, and, 
thereby, lower the relapse rate and i mprove survival. To this end, we propose to 
intensify the anti -leukemic efficacy of the current conditioning regimen by [CONTACT_450419] -leukemic drug clofarabine for fludarabine.  
 
Development of Relapse Risk Score  
In an effort to discriminate patient s at high and low risk for relapse/progression within 
this cohort, Cox regression was used to perform univariate and multivariate analyses of 
risk factors ( Table 1 ), treating non -relapse mortality as competing risk. Leukemia stage, 
cytogenetic risk status and time between diagnosis and HCT had statistically significant 
impact on the risk of relapse/progression.  
  
In order to stratify patients with respect to risk of relapse, we developed a simple risk 
score that summarizes the contribution of multiple risk  factors.  From a multivariate Cox 
regression model (excluding patients not in remission at the time of HCT), we assigned 
weights based on the relative magnitude of the log hazard ratios associated with the 
principal risk factors.  From a starting score of  0, points are added or subtracted based 
on the following risk factors:  2nd CR, 3rd or later CR, unfavorable cytogenetics, absence 
of pre -HCT peripheral blood cell count recovery and time from diagnosis to HCT > 18 
months ( Table 2 ).  Patients were then st ratified according to whether the total risk score 
was ≤0 (low risk) or >0 (high risk), providing a clear separation of relapse rates 
(Figure  2A) and overall survival 
(Figure 2B ).  Although this risk 
scoring system has not yet been 
prospectively validated, we believe it 
is adequate for risk stratification in the 
proposed protocol.  While all patients 
enrolled in this study will receive the 
same treatment regimen, the two risk 
groups will be analyzed separately, 
given the differences in the expected 
relapse rates.

Years from HCTClofarabine to Reduce Relapse Risk  
Clofarabine (2 -chloro -9-[deoxy -2’-fluoro --D-arabinofuranosyl] adenine; Cl -F-ara-A; 
CAFdA) is a rationally designed, second generati on purine nucleoside analogue. It was 
designed as a hybrid molecule to both overcome the limitations and incorporate the best 
qualities of both fludarabine (F -ara-A) and cladribine (2 -CdA, CdA). It was approved in 
December [ADDRESS_574036] 2 prior 
regimens, based on the induction of complete responses.  
 
In a phase I study involving pediatric patients with refractory and  relapsed leukemia, six 
clofarabine dose levels between 11.25 and 70 mg/m2/day were studied; the maximum 
tolerated dose was found to be 52 mg/m2/day for 5 days, which resulted in complete 
and sustained inhibition of DNA synthesis 29. In additi on, clofarabine demonstrated 
efficacy in early phase studies in older or relapsed patients with AML. In phase 2 clinical 
trials, treatment with single agent clofarabine  30 or in combination with cytarabine 31 32, 
demonstrated efficacy as induction therapy as well as salvage therapy in adult patients 
with AML resulting in overall response rates ranging from 41% to 60%. Safety and 
efficacy have not been established in adults (greater than 21 years of age) or patien ts 
aged 65 years and older (Prod Info Clolar(R) iv injection, 2008). Furthermore, several 
groups of investigators described incorporation of clofarabine into conditioning regimens 
for allogeneic HCT, in combination with a traditionally used alkylating agen t such as 
busulfan, melphalan or thiotepa  33-38,38,39. These single institution studies, albeit small, 
showed, that  conditioning regimens incorporating clofarabine in various combinations 
(mostly in combination with an alkylating agent), followed by [CONTACT_450421]. The replacement of fludarabine with clofarabine in busulfan -
containing preparative regimens did not seem to impact engraftment.  
 
The anti -tumor activity of clofarabine involves three major mechanisms: inhibition of 
DNA synthesis (through inhibition of DNA polymerase ), inhibition of ribonucleotide 
reductase (RnR) and direct induction of apoptosis 40,41. With respect to inhibition of RnR, 
clofarabine is superior to fludarabine 42, while in inhibiting DNA polymerase , 
2430.00

FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574037] setting.  
 
We therefore hypothesize that by [CONTACT_450422], recurrence rates of AML will be reduced without 
compromising engraftment or the favorable toxicity profile of this transplant approach.  
 
 
4. PROPOSAL  
 
The current multi -institutional protocol’s primary objective is to: Improve the 6 month 
relapse rate of patients with AML who are either > [ADDRESS_574038] following nonmyeloablative conditioning while maintaining historic rates 
of NRM and engraftment, or patients <55 years of age and are considered to be at high 
risk for serious toxicities associated with a conventional, high -dose pr eparative regimen. 
The study aim is to reduce the relapse rate to < 20% in high -risk patients and to < 5 % 
in low -risk patients  (low risk group terminated August 2014  – see statistical section ). We 
plan to achieve this goal by [CONTACT_450423], a n ew generation purine nucleoside 
analogue with both immunosuppressive and anti -leukemic activity for fludarabine in the 
standard low -dose TBI (2 , 3, or 4  Gy) regimen. The study will be conducted in 2 parts; 
first, a dose -finding part to determine the optima l dose of clofarabine followed by [CONTACT_450424] “optimal” dose. During Part 1, only patients with a relapse risk 
score > 0 (“high risk”, as described above, in Section 2. Background) will be enrolled.  
We will start by [CONTACT_450425] e daily on days -6 to -2 at 30 mg/m2/day (total 
dose: 150 mg/m2). If there is no dose limiting toxicity (DLT; see definition below) when 
the 3rd patient reaches day [ADDRESS_574039] (21 days after initiation of clofarabine), the next 
three patients will be tre ated with clofarabine at 40 mg/m2/day (total dose: 200 mg/m2), 
with the goal to treat the final three patients at 50 mg/m2/day (total dose: 250 mg/m2). 
Once the optimal dose of clofarabine is determined,  33 additional high risk patients and 
30 additional l ow risk patients  (low risk group terminated August 2014  – see statistical 
section ) will be treated with clofarabine at the maximum tolerated dose determined in 
Part 1.  Participation in clofarabine pharmacokinetic studies will be offered to patients 
with actual body weight > 15 kg treated at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center, a t all dose levels  (pharmacokinetic samples discontinued January 2017) .  A 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450355]. Should that 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84704], the dose of TBI will be increased by 1 Gy. In addition, a

relapse. If there exists reasonable evidence that the true rate of 100 day NRM exceeds 
5%, the study will be referred to the DSMB for review to determine whether 
modifications are  warranted or whether it needs to be terminated due to lack of safety

practice of the individual institution. The recommended procedure for patients with  10 of 
10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody (PRA) 
screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before HCT. If the PRA shows 
>10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches sh ould be 
obtained. The donor should be excluded if any of the cytotoxic cross match assays are 
positive.  For those patients with an HLA Class I allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B

B. HCT:  The hematopoietic graft will be unmodified, G -CSF-mobilized PBSC, collected 
as per NMDP standard, see additional details in section G  (Collection and Infusion of 
Donor PBSC ). Two 12 -liter leukaphereses will be on consecutive days, day –1 and day 
0; cells will be infused together on day 0 following TBI. Refer to institutional practice 
guidelines for methods of infusion. If the CD34+ cell dose is <5.0 x 106/kg after the 
second collection, a third day collection should be added, and extra dose of G -CSF 
should be given to the donor before the final collection.  
 
C. Cytoreduction:  Given the high risk of relapse for patients with AML allografted in 
relapse and the poor response to DLI for morphologically relapsed AML after allogeneic 
transplant, morphologic leukemia -free state (marrow blasts < 5%, the absence of 
circulating blasts) must be achieved prior to enrollment. The referring physician may 
administer therapy prior to the patient arriving at the transplant center. No high -dose 
chemotherapy can be given within three weeks (or the interval in which a cycle of 
standard chemotherapy would be administered in a non -transplant setting) prior to

D. CNS leukemia:  Patients must be evaluated for CNS leukemia with lumbar puncture, 
cytospin and flow cytometry of the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] p rior to enrollment. Patients with a 
history of treated CNS leukemia are eligible if there is no evidence CNS leukemia with 
lumbar puncture, cytospin and flow cytometry of the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_450358]. Patients with a history of treated CNS l eukemia will receive two doses of 
prophylactic intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy (either methotrexate or ara -c) prior to 
conditioning and 6 doses of IT chemotherapy following transplant starting on day +32.  
 
E. Conditioning Regimen (refer to Figure 3):  
The co nditioning regimen consists of clofarabine and TBI.  
  
Clofarabine will be administered as a 2 hour intravenous infusion once daily for 5 days, 
on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2.  
 
Part 1  
 
During Part 1, only patients with a relapse risk score > 0 (“high risk”,  as described above, 
in Section 3. Background) will be enrolled.  The study will initially treat three patients 
with clofarabine at 30 mg/m2/day (based on actual bodyweight) . If there is no evidence 
of DLT (see DLT below) when the 3rd patient has reached p ost HCT day 14, the next 
group of three patients will be treated with clofarabine at 40 mg/m2/day (based on actual 
bodyweight) , with the goal to treat the final group of three patients at 50 
mg/m2/day(based on actual bodyweight) .. 
 
If >1 patient experience s DLTs at a given clofarabine dosage, this will define excessive 
toxicity, and the next lower dose level will be used for Part 2. If only one patient 
experiences DLTs, then 3 additional patients will be treated at that clofarabine dosage. 
If there are no D LTs present in these additional three patients, dose escalation will 
continue.  
 
If excessive toxicity is seen at the starting dose level of 30 mg/m2/day, then de -
escalation to 20 mg/m2/day will occur.   
 
Clofarabine Related Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  is defined as grade 4 toxicity of the  
a) lungs (not including previous infections),  
b) heart,  
c) liver, not resolving within 48 hours  
d) kidneys,  not resolving within 48 hours  
e) gastrointestinal tract  
f) central nervous system  
2430.00  
 
Page 15 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 as defined by [CONTACT_450432]  v4.0 (CTCAE), 
occurring within 21 days of initiation of clofarabine  administration (post HCT day 14).  
 
Patients that experience DLTs will have further clofarabine doses held and proceed to 
TBI as previously scheduled.  
 
Part 2  
Once the optimal dose of clofarabine is determined in Part 1, accrual will be extended to 
patients with relapse risk score of < 0 (“low risk”) (low risk group terminated August 
2014  – see statistical section ) and > 0 (“high risk”, see description of relapse risk score 
in Section 2. Background). All additional patients will receive the same treatment 
regimen using clofarabine at that dose, but patients at high - and low risk for relapse will 
be analyzed separately  (low risk group terminat ed August 2014  – see statistical section ).   
Patients enrolled from Part 1 at the same dose used in Part 2 will be included in this 
analysis. We plan to treat 36 patients in the high -risk group and 30 patients in the low -
risk group  (low risk group terminat ed August 2014  – see statistical section ) at this dose 
of clofarabine (see section 15. Statistical Considerations and Termination of Study  for 
additional details).  
 
Clofarabine  Pharmacokinetics  (discontinued January 2017)  
Participation in clofarabine pharm acokinetics studies will be optional and will be offered 
to patients with actual body weight > [ADDRESS_574049] clofarabine dose,  2-3 ml of blood will be drawn from 
the Hickman venous access line at each of the following time points relative to the 
START of the 2 -hour infusion: end of clofarabine infusion (2 hr), [ADDRESS_574050], 4th and 5th doses of clofarabine, 2-3 ml of blood will be obtained 
before  EACH dose.. This constitutes a total of 9 pharmacokinetic samples, which will be 
used to obtain data on the levels of clofarabine.  
 
TBI of 2 Gy at 6 -15 cGy/min at the patient midplane  from a linear accelerator will be 
administered on day 0, followed by [CONTACT_450433]. Regardless of the actual time of TBI 
administration on Day 0, immunosuppression should be given per schedule and prior to 
the infusion of PBSC.  
 
The dose of TBI will be in creased by 1 Gy ONLY  if there is reasonable evidence that the 
rate of graft rejection exceeds the historical rate of 5% (see section on “Statistical 
Considerations and Termination of Study” for additional details).   
In this event, depending on the current  toxicity experience, the dose of clofarabine will 
be left at the same level or reduced one dose level.  In either case, the next 6 patients 
will be monitored for DLT.  If the dose level of clofarabine is reduced, then it will be 
restored to the previous l evel if no more than one DLT is seen in the next 6 patients.   If 
the dose level is not reduced, and more than one DLT is seen in the next 6 patients, 
then the dose of clofarabine will be reduced one level.  After dose adjustment the next 6 
patients will b e monitored for DLT in the same manner.

F. Immunosuppression (refer to Figure 3.):  
 
Day –3, patients with related donors:  Commence CSP  at 5.0mg/kg PO q12hrs, continue 
to day +56 and then taper to day +180. CSP should be routinely taken at 9:00 a.m. and 
9:00 p.m.  
 
Day –3, patients with unrelated donors:  Commence CSP  at 5.0mg/kg PO q12hrs, 
continue to day +100 and then taper to day +180. CSP should be routinely taken at 9:00 
a.m. and 9:00 p.m.  
 
Day 0, patients with related donors:  After  HCT on day 0, MMF will be given at 15mg/kg 
PO at 4 -6 hours after G -PBMC infusion is complete, then to be given at 15mg/kg PO 
q12hrs until day +28 included, then, in the absence of GVHD, stopped without tapering.  
 
Day 0, patients with unrelated donors:  After  HCT on day 0, MMF will be given at 
15mg/kg PO at 4 -6 hours after G -PBMC infusion is complete, then to be given at 
15mg/kg PO q8hrs until day +40 include d, and then taper to day +96.  
 
CSP 
1. Starting Dose in Adults :  CSP (Neoral  is preferred) is given orally at 5.0 mg/kg 
q12hrs PO (based on adjusted body weight) from day –3 until day +56 to patients 
with related donors and to day +100 to patients with unrelated donors.  Dose 
should be adjusted to maintain a high therapeutic CSP l evel as discussed below.  
If there is nausea and vomiting at anytime during CSP treatment the drug should 
be given intravenously at the dose that was used to obtain a therapeutic level.  
The conversion from oral CSP (Neoral) to intravenous cyclosporine = o ral 
cyclosporine dose divided by 2.[ADDRESS_574051] the dose.  The formulation of CSP can be changed to Sandimmune if 
nausea and vomiting are persistent.  
 
2.  Pediatric Dose:  Due to the variable and increased metabolism i n children, CSP 
will be started intravenously at the following doses at day –[ADDRESS_574052] when he or she is able to take 
oral medications. Dose should be adjusted to maintain high therapeutic levels as 
discussed below. If nausea or vomiting occurs at any time during CSP treatment, 
CSP should be administered i ntravenously at the dose that was used to obtain a 
therapeutic level. The conversion from oral CSP (Neoral) to intravenous 
cyclosporine = oral cyclosporine dose divided by 2.[ADDRESS_574053] the dose.  
• Age ≤6 years old: 1.6mg/kg IV q8hrs  
• Age >6 years old: 2.0mg/kg po or IV q12hrs. Administration route (po or IV) will 
be left to the discretion of Pediatric Attending.  
2430.00  
 
Page 17 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
  
3.  In the absence of GVHD, for related donor graft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: CSP is to be tapered 
from da y +56 and discontinued on day + 180; for unrelated donor graft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 
CSP is to be tapered from day +100 and discontinued on day +180. The referring 
physician, who will receive explicit instructions and guidelines for detecting and 
managing GVHD, will  manage this. Modifications of the taper schedule may be 
indicated if significant disease progression occurs early post -transplant  
 
4. Blood pressure, renal function (serum creatinine, BUN), electrolytes and 
magnesium need to be followed at least three tim es per week during the first 
month, twice weekly until day +100, then once per week until CSP is stopped, 
unless clinical circumstances suggest the need for more frequent evaluations.   
 
5. Dose Adjustments: CSP, whole blood "trough" levels (i.e. 11-12 hours from the 
prior dose) will be evaluated on day “0” of transplant and adjusted if necessary to 
maintain blood levels of 400 ng/ml (upper end of the therapeutic range of the 
FHCRC CSP assay). After day + 28, typi[INVESTIGATOR_450359] 120 and 360 will be targeted. The rational for requiring initial high CSP 
doses is extrapolated from the preclinical nonmyeloablative canine studies, which 
used an equivalent dose to establish an allograft. Dose reductions should only be 
made if CSP t oxicity (such as renal insufficiency) is present, or levels exceed 
values provided in Table 3 .  in the absence of toxicity. Dose reductions for high 
levels with or without toxicity should be conservative e.g. 25%, to avoid 
inadequate immune suppression. A decrease of the GFR by >50% or increase of 
creatinine of 2x baseline values attributable to CSP therapy will be justification for 
a 25% decrease in CSP dose.  However, therapeutic levels of CSP should be 
maintained.

6. CSP Monitoring:   Further CSP determinations should be performed on a twice 
weekly basis for the first month and then weekly until day +100 unless high levels 
are detected (see Table 3), or toxicity is suspected in which case more frequent 
monitoring will be performed as clinically indicated.  Routine monitoring of CSP 
may follow institutional guidelines beyond day +140.

*Discontinuation of fluconazole, voriconazole or itraconazole  may lower CSP levels, and if used as 
antifungal prophylaxis changes in these drugs should be avoided during the first month post -
transplant.  
MMF  
1. Initiating MMF Therapy:   Oral administration of MMF will be given based on 
adjusted body weight at 15 mg/kg (4 5 mg/kg/day) from the evening of day 0 (i.e. 
first dose to follow [ADDRESS_574054]).  Patients with related donors will receive 
subsequent doses q12hrs, patients with unrelated donors q8hrs. Doses will be 
rounded to the nearest 250mg (capsules are 250mg ).  If there is nausea and 
vomiting at any time preventing the oral administration of MMF, MMF should be 
administered intravenously based on adjusted body weight at 15mg/kg every 12 
or 8 hrs, depending on donor type, as above.  
 
2. Tapering of MMF:   Patients w ith related donors will receive MMF 15mg/kg q12hrs 
through day +28; then, in the absence of GVHD, MMF will be stopped without 
tapering.  
 
Patients with unrelated donors will be given MMF daily at 15mg/kg q8hrs through 
day +[ADDRESS_574055] transplant, and then in t he absence of GVHD, MMF should be 
tapered on day +41 by 11%/week x 8 weeks and discontinued on day +96.  
 
3. Maintaining MMF:   Markedly low (<40%) donor T -cell chimerism after HCT may 
indicate impending graft rejection. MMF should be continued at full dose or,  if 
MMF taper has been initiated, reinstitution of full dose MMF should occur.  
Consideration of graft salvage with use of pentostatin + DLI (as per protocol 1825) 
should be considered.  Decrease CSP Levels  Increase CSP Levels  Enhance Potential for

4. Guidelines for MMF dose adjustment due to drug toxicity:   
If in the clinical judgment of the attending physician the observed toxicity is 
related to MMF administration, a dose adjustment may occur.  The 
discontinuation of MMF at any point should be discussed with the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_450362] m edical record and all Case Report 
Forms (CRF).  
 
Gastrointestinal Toxicity .  Severe gastrointestinal toxicities such as 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage have been very rare after nonmyeloablative HCT. In 
the event of gastrointestinal toxicity that requires medic al intervention including 
medication for control of persistent vomiting or diarrhea that is considered to be 
due to MMF after day +28, a 20% dose reduction will be made or the drug may 
be given IV. If severe refractory diarrhea or overt gastrointestinal bl eeding occurs, 
MMF may be temporarily stopped. Then MMF should be restarted at 20% 
reduced dose when the underlying toxicity subsides.  
 
Neutropenia .  Based on previous experience in patients after nonmyeloablative 
HCT, dose adjustments are likely to occur because of hematopoietic adverse 
effects, in particular neutropenia.  A thorough evaluation of neutropenia should 
occur including peripheral blood chimerism studies, marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_450363] (e.g. bactrim, ganciclovir) .  If all other 
potential causes of marrow toxicity are ruled out, dose adjustments will only be 
made for grade IV neutropenia that persists after day +[ADDRESS_574056] -transplant. Dose 
reductions should be conservative (20%).  After day +21, the use of G -CSF will 
be permitted for neutropenia. For severe toxicity related to MMF (grade IV 
neutropenia > 5 days refractory to G -CSF), MMF may be decreased and if 
neutropenia persists, MMF can be stopped.  The MMF should be restarted at 20% 
reduced dose when the underlying  toxicity subsides.  
 
 
G. Collection and Infusions of Donor PBSC:  
1. G-CSF Administration to Donors:  All related donors will receive G -CSF 16 ug/kg/day 
for 5 consecutive days from day -4 to day –0 (Table 5 ). G-CSF will be administered by a 
subcutaneous dai ly injection. These doses will be administered before 10:00 a.m. each 
day in the Outpatient Department (OPD). The schedule of G -CSF administration and 
PBSC collections can only be ascertained once day [ADDRESS_574057] (see Table 3) as per NMDP protocol. Donors will receive approximately 
16 μg/kg of GCSF each day of mobiliz ation. A 12 liter apheresis will be obtained on day

2. PBSC Collection:  related donors  will preferably undergo vein -to-vein collections or 
may receive an appropriate catheter inserted on or before day of apheresis. PBSC will 
be collected in the afternoon of day -1, stored in the refrigerator at 4ºC overnight. A 
second collecti on will be performed the following afternoon and both collections will be 
transfused on day 0. If < 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg are collected an additional day of 
collection will be performed. If PBSCs cannot be collected by a vein -to-vein technique, a 
percutan eous Mahurkar catheter will be inserted. General procedures will include the 
use of a standard apheresis machine (COBE Spectra, Lakewood Colo.), and processing 
up to 24 liters of whole blood during the collection. The plan for PBSC collection is 
shown in Table 5.  
 
PBSC Collection:  for unrelated donors  scheduling and collection is arranged through 
unrelated donor registries. The schedule of G -CSF administration and collection of 
PBSC is determined as per NMDP protocol. The physician responsible for PBSC 
collection will obtain informed consent from the donor.  
 
3. PBSC infusion:  All patients will receive unmodified PBSC infusion on day 0 of the 
treatment regimen (Refer to institutional practice guidelines for methods of infusion).  
 
H. ABO Incompatibility  
All pa tients with ABO incompatibility should be evaluated and treated according to the 
standard practice of the individual institution. Recommendations are provided in 
Appendix D.  It should be noted that two cases of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_450364]47. The suspected 
cause is donor anti -host hemagglutinin production from “passenger lymphocytes” in the 
donor  PBSC that may expand post transplant. Therefore, patients should be monitored 
and treated aggressively when there is any evidence of hemolysis.

FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574059] transplants (ANC < 500/μL).  
J. Infection Prophylaxis  
Recommended prophylaxis for PCP, VZV, and HSV are listed in Appendix E  with the 
modific ation that PCP, VZV, and antifungal prophylaxis should be continued if the 
patient is receiving treatment for chronic GVHD. To the extent possible, use of 
nephrotoxic (eg, vancomycin, amphotericin B, etc) and hepatotoxic (eg, voriconazole, 
etc) agents is t o be avoided during clofarabine administration.  
 
During clofarabine administration and for the following 3 days (until day +1) Micafungin 
will be used as antifungal prophylaxis due to possible liver toxicity. Prophylactic adult 
dosing is 50 mg IV daily. P rophylactic pediatric dosing is:  Age 2 -8 years old: 
2mg/kg/dose per day max of 50mg daily.  Age >8 -28 years old: 1mg/kg/dose per day 
max 50mg daily . Following that, since antifungal prophylaxis strategies are evolving, 
patients may receive antifungal proph ylaxis as per the standard practice of the 
treatment institution.  Standard CMV monitoring and prophylaxis should commence at 
the time of transplant and should continue as per standard practice.  Patients who reject 
their graft can discontinue this infecti on prophylaxis.  
 
IgG levels and IVIG Supplemental replacement will be monitored per Institutional 
Practice.   
 
K. Endpoint/Treatment Failure  
 
Disease progression  will be defined as  
a. Persistence or appearance of aberrant blasts on a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_450365]  
b. Persistence or reappearance of a previously described cytogenetic or molecular 
abnormality.  
 
Relapse  will be defined as the presence of >5% blasts by [CONTACT_450435] a marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_450366].  
 
Evidence of disease progression or relapse at any time point following HCT will be 
considered a treatment failure, and consideration will be given to withdrawal of 
immun osuppression, chemotherapy and/or DLI on another protocol. Such treatment will 
be at the discretion of the attending physician. Patients who are considered treatment 
failures will still be followed for outcomes.  
 
L. Modifications of Immunosuppression for D isease Progression/Relapse and Low 
Donor T -cell Chimerism:  This section provides guidelines for management of patients 
with AML progression/relapse and low donor chimerism.   
 
 
2430.00  
 
Page 23 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 1. Progression/Relapse  
Evidence of AML progression/relapse will be an indicatio n for therapeutic intervention.  
In part, this will be dependent on where a patient is relative to the standard tapering 
schedule.  If the attending physician believes that the patient requires very aggressive 
therapy, the case will be presented to the ins titutions’ patient review committee.  
 
In the absence of GVHD priority should be given to rapid reduction of 
immunosuppression, the details of which will be left to the discretion of the attending 
physician. One possible approach is to discontinue MMF if i t’s still being taken, and 
taper CSP over 2 weeks. Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_450367] 2 weeks.  An alternative approach that can 
be considered, especially, when there is a concern of an acute  GVHD flare is the abrupt 
discontinuation of both CSP and MMF followed by [CONTACT_450436] 
(10 mg/m2) methotrexate.  
 
DLI will not be given for progressive or relapsed disease on this protocol, and patients 
with relapse or progression would  be eligible for other ongoing intervention protocols or 
treatment plans (i.e. re -induction, DLI, hypomethylating agents, TK inhibitors, etc), 
according to the attending physician’s preference.  
 
2. Low Donor T -Cell chimerism  
Definition of mixed donor/host  chimerism, engraftment, graft failure and rejection.  For 
the purposes of this protocol, mixed chimerism  will be defined as the detection of donor 
T-cells (CD3+) and granulocytes (CD 33+), as a proportion of the total T -cell and 
granulocyte population, res pectively, of greater than 5% and less than 95% in the 
peripheral blood.  Full donor chimerism  is defined as > 95% donor CD3+ T -cells. Mixed 
or full donor chimerism will be evidence of donor engraftment .  Increasing donor 
chimerism  is defined as an absolut e increase of 20% of CD3+ donor T -cells over the 
previous chimerism evaluation. Decreasing donor chimerism  is defined as an absolute 
decrease of 20% of CD3+ T -cell chimerism over the previous evaluation.  Low donor 
chimerism  is defined as < 40% CD3+ donor T -cells after HCT.  Low donor chimerism 
should always be confirmed with repeat peripheral blood T -cell and granulocyte 
chimerism analysis.  A DNA -based assay that compares the profile of amplified 
fragment length polymorphisms (ampFLP) (or FISH studies or VNTR) of the patient and 
donor will be used to quantitate chimerism of sorted peripheral blood T -cells (CD3+) and 
granulocytes (CD 33+). The same assay should be used in a given patient for repeated 
studies of chimerism.  This DNA -based ana lysis will also be performed on the whole 
nucleated cell fraction from marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]. Therapeutic decisions (e.g. pentostatin + 
DLI as per protocol 1825) will be made based on the results of sorted T -cell studies of 
peripheral blood.  For the purposes of  this protocol, graft rejection  is defined as the 
inability to detect or loss of detection of greater than 5% donor T -cells (CD3+) as a 
proportion of the total T -cell population, respectively, after nonmyeloablative HCT.  Also 
for the purposes of this prot ocol, graft failure is defined as grade IV thrombocytopenia 
and neutropenia after day +28 that lasts > 2 weeks and is refractory to growth factor 
support. TBI dose escalation in this protocol will be based on graft rejection.

FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574060] transplant. If the 
patient has not obtained > 95% donor chimerism in CD+[ADDRESS_574061] transplant as clinically indicated.  Peripheral blood will be 
sorted to evaluate T -cell (CD+3), granulocyte (CD+33), and/or  NK cell (CD56) 
compartments. ( See Patient Post Transplant Evaluation section for instructions and 
exceptions).  
 
Decreas ing Donor Chimerism and Graft Rejection. Decreasing donor chimerism after 
day +28 may indicate that graft rejection is occurring. DLI alone does not appear to 
reverse this process. The patient’s case should be discussed with the  
FHCRC principal investigato r of the study. Patients who reject their grafts will not be 
offered DLI on this protocol and may be eligible for a second allograft on another 
protocol.  
 
11. PATIENT EVALUATIONS  
 
A. Patient Pretransplant/Baseline Evaluation.   
 
Work -up should include the f ollowing:

12. DONOR EVALUATIONS  
 
1. Complete history and physical examination.  
 
2. Lab tests: CBC with reticulocytes and platelet counts, serum sodium, potassium, 
chloride, CO2, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, LDH, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, 
alkaline phosphatase, AST, A LT, hepatitis screen, CMV, syphilis, HIV and HTLV I 
serologies and ABO Rh blood typi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  If the donor has antibodies against red cell 
antigens of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the titers will be determined. Cytotoxic crossmatch between 
patient and donor will be performed  (HLA Laboratory).  
 
3. No placement of a central line is necessary for PBSC collection unless it is 
determined that the donor has poor venous access. If necessary, a temporary apheresis 
(e.g. Mahurkar) catheter will be placed at the time of leukapheresis.  
 
4. A CBC will be checked prior to and after leukapheresis collection, and daily while on 
G-CSF. CBCs will be checked thereafter if clinically indicated.  
 
5. The donor will be reevaluated with a directed history and physical examination the 
day after the apheresis is completed.  
 
6. To subsequently determine the origin of relapse, heparinized blood will be sent from 
the donor to CIL (FHCRC: 206 -288-7700) for a DNA -based assay that compares the 
profile of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (ampFLP) of the patient and donor.  
 
7. For females of child bearing age, serum pregnancy qualitative [PGSTAT] within 72 
hours prior to initial dose of filgrastim (G -CSF). Results must be available prior to 
filgrastim (GCSF) dose.

 13. DRUGS AND TOXICITIES  
 
Cyclospo rine, MMF and clofarabine are all commercially available. They should be 
stored and mixed according to manufacturer's recommendations.  
 
A. For the purposes of this protocol, toxicity will be graded using the modified NCI 
common toxicity scale ( Appendix P ). 
 
B. Clofarabine  See section 10.E Conditioning Regimen  for information about 
administration and dosage adjustments.  
Chemical Name:  
2-chloro -9-(2′-deoxy -2′-fluoro -β-D-arabinofuranosyl) -9H-purine -6-amine  
Other names:  
CLOLAR, clofarabine; CAFdA; Cl -F-ara-A; 
2-chloro -2′-fluoro -deoxy -9-β arabinofuranosyladenine  
2-chloro -9-(2-deoxy -2-fluoro -β-D-arabinofuranosyl) adenine (Cl -F-ara-A)

2-chloro -2′-ara-fluorodeoxyadenosine  (CAFdA)  
2-chloro -2′-fluorodeoxyadenosine  (CAFdA)  
 
Physical and Chemical Characteristics:  
Clofarabine is a white to off -white solid with a melting point of 228°C to 230°C and a 
molecular weight of 303.5. The drug substance is very stable in the dry state, and 
aqueous solutions are stable to heat treatment. Clofarabine is freely soluble in water 
(1.5 mg/mL) or buffered solutions at room temperature. Clofarabine is not less than 97% 
pure on a dried basis by [CONTACT_116141] (HPLC) analysis. 
Clofarabine is formulated at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Clofarabine is supplied in 1 vial 
size: a 20 -mL clear, glass vial with gray stopper and blue flip off seal. The 20 -mL vials 
contain 20 mL (20 mg) of sterile solution. The pH range of the solution is 4.5 to 7.5. The 
solution is clear and practically colorless, preservative free, and free from foreign matter.  
 
Toxicity (IV Studies):  
1. Adult Patients  
Drug -related adverse events (AE) observed in at least 10% of adult patients treated with 
clofarabine in previous clinical trials include myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, 
infections, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, rigors, dermatitis, anorexia, febrile neutropenia, 
myalgia, asthenia, petechiae, transient elevated liver enzymes, stomatitis, mucositis, 
pyrexia,  flushing, constipation, edema, dehydration, nervousness, stomach pain, 
insomnia, depression, dry skin, back pain, and decreased weight.  
 
Adverse events reported in <10% of adult patients include tumor lysis syndrome, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]/SIRS, palmar p lantar erythrodysesthesia, pancreatitis, seizures, 
irregular heartbeat, edema, pericardial effusion, multi -organ failure, and death.  
 
  
2430.00  
 
Page 31 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574068] common side effects observed in previous clinical studies of pediatric patients 
treated w ith clofarabine 52 mg/m2 include vomiting NOS, nausea, febrile neutropenia, 
diarrhea, headache, pruritus, pyrexia, dermatitis, fatigue, rigors, abdominal pain, 
tachycardia, anorexia, petechiae, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], pain in limb, hypotension, anxiety, cough, 
constipa tion, erythema, mucosal inflammation, NOS, pain, flushing, edema, and 
hematuria.  
 
Pediatric patients have also experienced increased liver enzymes and increased 
creatinine. Moderate neurological changes have been reported in some patients. 
Infections were reported in almost half of the patients treated with clofarabine.  
Other potential severe AEs include pericardial effusion, LVSD, tumor lysis syndrome, 
SIRS, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737].  
 
3. Management of Capi[INVESTIGATOR_450370], during  or shortly after IV clofarabine administration a few patients 
developed signs and symptoms consistent with capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]. In these 
heavily pretreated patients, it has been difficult to separate potential drug -related cases 
of capi[INVESTIGATOR_450371]/sepsis, 
progressive disease, or other underlying problems resulting from prior antileukemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
For these reasons, during and after each dose of clofarabine  investigators are to assess 
patie nts for the onset of the following signs or symptoms ≥ grade 2:  
− Tachypnea or other evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506];  
− Unexplained hypotension; and/or  
− Unexplained tachycardia.  
If one or more of these signs or symptoms occurs during clofarabine infusion , 
clofarabine administration is to be interrupted or held as clinically indicated. It is 
recognized that the total infusion time for this clofarabine dose in this circumstance may 
exceed 2 hours. Thus, if the patient’s condition stabilizes or improves, clo farabine 
administration may resume.  
Pretreatment with steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 100 mg/day or its equivalent or  
dexamethasone 20 mg/day as part of an anti -emetic regimen) is recommended for all 
subsequent doses during the remainder of clofarabine treat ment.  
 
4. Management of liver toxicity  
Severe and fatal hepatotoxicity has occurred with the use of clofarabine. In clinical 
studies, Grade 3 -4 liver enzyme elevations were observed in pediatric patients during 
treatment with clofarabine at the following rates: elevated aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) occurred in 36% of patients; elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occurred in 
44% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 elevated bilirubin occurred in 13% of patients, with 2 
events reported as Grade 4 hype rbilirubinemia (2%), one of which resulted in treatment 
discontinuation and one patient had multi -organ failure and died. Monitor hepatic 
function and discontinue clofarabine for Grade [ADDRESS_574069] PI [INVESTIGATOR_450372].

Page 32 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 C. TBI : TBI will be given in one 200 , 300, or 400  cGy fraction from linear accelerator at 
a rate of 6 - 7 cGy /min. Dosimetry calculations are performed by [CONTACT_450439][INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
At the dosage used, side effects are not expected. Nevertheless, there may be fever, 
alopecia, parotitis, diarrhea, reversible skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], mucositis and late effects 
including ca taract formation, growth retardation, pulmonary damage, carcinogenesis, 
and sterilization.  
 
D. CSP : See section 10.F. Immunosuppression  for information about administration 
and dosage adjustments. Side effects are generally reversible and may include renal  
insufficiency and failure, hypomagnesemia, paresthesias, tremor, seizures, visual 
disturbances, paresis, disorientation, depression, confusion, somnolence, coma, 
nausea, hypertension, hemolytic -uremic syndrome, hyperglycemia, gynecomastia, and 
hypertricho sis. See standard practice manual for additional information about 
administration, toxicity and complications.  
 
E. MMF : See section 10.F. Immunosuppression  for information about administration 
and dosage adjustments. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) : is supplie d in 250mg hard 
gelatin capsules. Capsules may be stored at room temperature.  
 
1. Precautions: previous clinical studies suggested that the principal adverse reactions 
associated with the administration of MMF include leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting and 
diarrhea. Patients will be monitored for the development of these complications.  
 
2. Adverse Events: administration of MMF may be associated with vomiting, diarrhea, 
anemia, leukocytopenia and infection. In the setting of marrow transplantation, however, 
severa l etiologic factors may contribute to these symptoms. MMF has an increased 
incidence of digestive system adverse events, including GI tract ulceration, and 
hemorrhage (3% of patients receiving MMF). GI tract perforations have rarely been 
observed. Up to 2%  of patients receiving MMF for prevention of rejection developed 
severe neutropenia (ANC <500). The development of neutropenia may be related to 
MMF itself, concomitant medications, viral infections or some combination of these 
causes. MMF dose adjustments  will be made if clinically indicated if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_450373], no other cause is thought to be causative for the abnormality. 
These adjustments should be discussed with the principal investigator.  
 
F. GVHD : 
1. Diagnosis:  Skin involvem ent will be assessed by [CONTACT_450440]. GI symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_450374]. Acute GVHD and chronic GVHD will be graded according to 
established criteria ( Appendix F and G ). 
2. Treatment:  
Details of GVHD treatment will be left to the discretion of the attending physician. 
Patients may also be eligible for institutional trials of GVHD therapy.  
 
G. Myelosuppression  
Grade IV myelosuppression will be defined as a decrease in ANC  to <500/uL  and/or 
platelet count to ≤ 20,000/ uL. If myelosuppression occurs beyond day +28, a bone 
2430.00

 marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_450375]. 
Samples should be sent for chimerism analysis by a DNA -based assay that comp ares 
the profile of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (ampFLP) (or FISH studies or 
VNTR) of the patient and donor. Myelosuppression may occur in this patient population 
for a number of reasons such as direct toxic effect of drugs (clofarabine, MMF, 
ganciclovir etc.), rejection, relapse or after DLI.  Patients who are > [ADDRESS_574070] 
with an ANC of <500/uL  may receive G -CSF 5μg/kg/day S.C. Thrombocytopenic 
patients will receive platelet transfusion as per standard care.

14. RECORDS  
 
Clinical records will be maintained as confidentially as possible by [CONTACT_450441]. Collection of Case Report Forms (CRF) at standard intervals is the primary 
method of collecting data from collaborating centers. Clinical Statistics at FHCRC 
maintains a patient database to allow storage and retrieval of patient data collected from 
a wide variety of sou rces. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_450376], key entry and verification. 
These data are then entered into a secure dedicated database operated by a data 
manager. Any publicati on or presentation will refer to patients by a unique patient 
number and not by [CONTACT_450442]. The licensed medical records 
department, affiliated with the institution where the patient receives medical care, 
maintains all original  inpatient and outpatient chart documents. At the FHCRC, patient 
research files are kept in a locked room. They are maintained by [CONTACT_450443] A.R.T. Access is restricted to personnel 
authorized by [CONTACT_450444] o f Clinical Research.  
 
 
15. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND TERMINATION OF STUDY  
 
Part 1: dose escalation  
The primary objective of Part [ADDRESS_574071]. D uring Part 1, only 
patients with a risk score > 0 (“high risk” as described above, in Section 2. Background) 
will be enrolled.  A standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be employed starting at a 
dose of 30 mg/m2/day x 5 days (total dose 150 mg/m2), as de scribed above.  If [ADDRESS_574072] dose level, 50 
mg/m2/day (total dose of 250 mg/m2) has acceptable toxicity, then that dose level will be 
used for Part 2. The operating characteristics of this dose escalation rule are defined in 
this table. If excessive toxicity is seen at the starting dose level of 30 mg/m2/day, then 
de-escalation to 20 mg/m2/day will occur.   
 
True rate of DLT  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 
Probability of escalation  91% 71% 49% 31% 17% 8% 3% 1% <1% 
 
During Part 1, a second occurrence of graft rejection in up to [ADDRESS_574073] 90% confident that the true rate of graft 
rejection exceeds the historical rate of 5%.  If a single engraftment failure is observed in 
the first [ADDRESS_574074] be enrolled 
at the same level without an additional engraftment failure before dose escalation can 
continue.  If a second engraftment failure occurs, then the dos e of TBI will be increased 
by 1 Gy.  Dose escalation will restart at the current clofarabine dose, provided that 
2430.00  
 
Page 35 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574075] been permitted according to the criteria above; 
otherwise, the clofarabine dose will be decreased one le vel. 
 
Part 2: efficacy analysis  
The primary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate whether the substitution of clofarabine for 
fludarabine can improve the 6 month rate of disease relapse/progression, as defined in 
Section 9.K, compared to our historical experience with a Flu/TBI non -myeloabl ative 
conditioning regimen followed by [CONTACT_417929].  The historical rates are approximately 35% at [ADDRESS_574076] in a high risk group (risk score > 0), and approximately 15% at [ADDRESS_574077] in a low risk group (risk score ≤ 0 (low risk group terminated August 
2014) ).  The risk score for a patient is determined by [CONTACT_136434], as 
described Section 2. Background: 2nd CR, +1; 3rd or later CR, +2; unfavorable 
cytogenetics, +1; lack of peripheral blood cell count recovery (platelet count > 
100,000/l; neutrophils > 1,000/ l), +0.5; greater than 18 months from diagnosis to 
transplant, -2. 
 
All patients will receive the same treatment regimen, but the two risk groups will be 
analyzed separately.   Patients enrolled from Part 1 at the same dose u sed in Part 2 will 
be included in this analysis.  
 
In the high risk group, 36 patients will provide 83% power to detect a 15 percentage 
point improvement in the relapse/progression rate, to 20%, with a [ADDRESS_574078] in 9 or 
fewer patients.  
 
In the low risk group, 30 patients will provide 81% power to detect a 10 percentage point 
improvement in the relapse/progression rate, to 5%, with a [ADDRESS_574079] in 2 or fewer 
patients.  (low risk group terminated August 2014)  
 
With the termination of the low risk group as of August 2014, total enrollment will be [ADDRESS_574080], 2014, accrual of low risk patients in Part 2 
was halted with only 2 patients accrued.  All statistical considerations pertaining to the 
high risk group as described herein are unchanged.  
 
Futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]  (Part 2 patients, and part 1 p atients at maximum tolerated 
dose)  
.  If there is reasonable evidence that the rate of relapse/progression within a risk group 
is not improved over the historical benchmark, then accrual to that risk group will be 
terminated.  Reasonable evidence will be t aken to mean that the lower bound of a 1 -
sided 80% confidence interval for the true rate of relapse/progression exceeds 35% for 
the high risk group or 15% for the low risk group.  Operationally, this rule will be 
triggered by :

Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450377] -relapse mortality, defined as any death occurring 
in the absence of documented relapse or progression, and engraftment failure.   The 
historical experience is that the NRM rate at [ADDRESS_574081] in this patient 
population is only 5%.  We will halt the study for safety review by [CONTACT_450445] 5%.  
Reasonable evidence will be taken to mean that the lower bound of a 1 -sided 90% 
confidence interval for the true rate of day 100 NRM exceeds 5%.  Operationally, this 
rule will be evaluated at least every 10 patients as follows:  
 
• NRM (5% threshold): 2/10, 3/20, 4/30, 5/40  
 
Patients may continue to be enrolled pending evaluation of the day 100 endpoint, but 
the outcome in subsequently enrolled patients cannot override the rule if triggered in a 
lesser number.  The operating characteristics of the rule are summarized in the table

16. DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN  
 
1. Monitoring the progress of trials and the safety of participants  
Protocol 2430 is a multi -institutional clinical trial that is monitored by [CONTACT_1961] (PI), Dr . Brenda Sandmaier , with oversight by a Data Safety and Monitoring 
Board (DSMB), the Data Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSMC ) and the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450380] a minimum of [ADDRESS_574086] and the updated 
data are presented at Mixed Chimerism Meetings (includes co -investigators) . Please 
see Appendix I and J for definitions of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE) 
and serious and unexpected events as well as mechanisms for reporting these events. 
SAEs are reported to the trial coordinator. The trial coordinators at collabor ating centers 
or the local PIs will fax an official report of an SAE to the coordinating center (FHCRC) 
within ten days. The SAE report is reviewed by [CONTACT_978] . If the SAE meets the FHCRC 
criteria for  expedited  reporting then an official signed report is submitted to the FHCRC 
Institutional Review Office (IRO). All deaths, regardless of the cause, are reported to the 
IRB. Protocol [ADDRESS_574087] a dedicated independent DSMB responsible for monitoring 
patient saf ety on this clinical trial. The DSMB will meet at approximately six month 
intervals for this protocol and all outcome data will be reviewed including all adverse 
events and SAEs reported to the coordinating center (FHCRC) along with those 
officially report ed to the FHCRC IRO. The DSMB will confirm that the trial has or has not 
met any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_450381]. A report from the DSMB is submitted to the FHCRC IRB as 
well as the trial co ordinators/local PIs of this protocol. The DSMB will discontinue the 
review of outcomes when this protocol is closed to accrual and the last patient treated is 
past day +180. Furthermore, the FHCRC also has a DSMC  that reviews the progress of 
the protocol with respect to the monitoring plan at the time of each annual renewal. As 
with initial review, annual IRB review and approval will also be required. Flow of 
information concerning clinical trial participants will originate with the clinicians and 
nurses i n the clinic or referring clinicians at other institutions and is transmitted to the 
trial coordinator. At the FHCRC, health care providers and rotating attending physicians 
assess patients and record their observations regarding toxicity and response outc omes 
2430.00  
 
Page 40 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574088]. This documentation is extracted by [CONTACT_450446] 140 
days +/ - after HCT via chart review and collection of copi[INVESTIGATOR_450382] a hard copy or electronic Case Report Form (CRF). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_450383]. When the CRFs are verified, they are 
signed  by [CONTACT_978]. . Thus, multiple health care providers provide independent 
observations and participate in monitoring this trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_443875] a clinician for some 
patients entered on this trial. However, assessments are the sum total of the primary 
health care provider (fellow or physician assistant), floor or outpatient nurse and the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_450384]. If determination of adverse 
events is controversial, co -investigators will convene on an ad hoc basis as necessary 
to review the primary data and render a decision. Protocol [ADDRESS_574089] internal auditing mechanisms that assure accurate assessment of clinical 
outcomes. Clinical outcome data will be summarized and transmitted from collabo rating 
centers as CRFs. When possible, primary source documents regarding patient 
outcomes will be collected with patients’ names removed and replaced by [CONTACT_450447] (UPNs). The CRFs are generated from the collaborating centers at 
defined time p oints (100 days, 6 months, and yearly). The local PI [INVESTIGATOR_450385]. When the CRFs are verified, they are signed and 
data will be entered into a central database managed by [CONTACT_450448].  
 
2. Plans for assurin g compliance with requirements regarding the reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events SAEs  
The adverse event reporting in this multi -institutional clinical trial will follow the FHCRC 
Guidelines for SAE reporting. These guidelines (attached in Appendix I .) deta il the 
expedited reporting requirements, definitions of particular events. All SAEs  that meet 
expedited reporting criteria  are reported to the IRO within [ADDRESS_574090] fulfilled all NIH requirements for training in human subjects’ 
protection.

Page 41 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 3. Plans for assuring that any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension 
of an NCI -funded clinical trial is reported to t he NCI grant program director responsible 
for the grant  
This clinical research trial uses commercial agents and there is no associated 
Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Any 
temporary or permanent suspension, as deter mined by [CONTACT_978], IRB, or DSMC , of this 
clinical research trial will be reported to the NCI grant program director by [CONTACT_978].  
 
4. Plans for assuring data accuracy and protocol compliance  
Collaborating sites will send signed consents, eligibility forms, and CRFs with source 
documents demonstrating eligibility, treatment, and serious adverse events (if 
applicable) to the study staff. These are reviewed for eligibility, adherence to the 
protocol, accuracy, and completeness by [CONTACT_5984]. Queries are sent t o the 
collaborating investigators if CRFs are inaccurate or incomplete. The study will be 
monitored under the FHCRC Monitoring Plan. The FHCRC Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan details the full scope and extent of monitoring and provides for immediate action  in 
the event of the discovery of major deviations.

ABO INCOMPATIBILITY  
 
Red Blood Cell - Incompatibility (Major):  
Occasional patients may have antibodies directed against red blood cell antigens found on the 
donor's cells. These are generally ABO or Rh antigens, although incompatibility with other red 
cell antigens identified by [CONTACT_48919] -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_450386]. Although the volume of red 
blood cells (RBC) in most PBMC prod ucts will only be 2 -5% of the product volume before 
infusion, the small quantity may cause a hemolytic transfusion reaction. According to the 
FHCRC policy it is generally acceptable to infuse a volume of about 10ml RBCs per product. If 
the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_443880] -donor titer of ≥ 1:32 or the RBC volume is greater than 10ml (or 
>20ml in two products combined) the PBMC components should be RBC depleted by [CONTACT_450454] (flowsheet below). Refer to the Clinical Coordinator's Patient  Information Sheet 
for instructions regarding management of a specific patient.  
Post transplant blood component support will be according to Standard Practice 
Guidelines.  
 
Timing: Every attempt should be made to infuse red cell depleted PBMC products within 2 
hours of depletion . 
 
Expected Results: Red blood cell depleted PBMC products will contain < 10ml of red blood 
cells and ≥ 90% nucleated cell recovery.  
 
Red Blood Cell - Incompatibility (Minor): Occasional donors may have antibodies directed 
against red blood cell antigens ( ABO, Rh, or other antigen system) found on the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s cells. 
The risk of hemolysis of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_450387]. Due to the high number of lymphocytes in the PBMC inoculum, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_450388] a delayed type of hemolysis that can be severe. PBMC products 
contain <  200ml of plasma according to FHCRC policy and no deleterious effects have been 
observed so far. However, if donors show an anti -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_443883] ≥ 1:256, the PBM C component 
should be plasma depleted (see flowsheet below). Refer to the Clinical  Coordinator's Patient 
Information Sheet for instructions regarding management of a specific patient.  
Post transplant blood component support will be according to Standard Pr actice 
Guidelines.  
 
Timing: Every attempt should be made to infuse plasma -depleted PBMC within 2 hours of 
depletion.  
 
Expected Results: The plasma depletion should not affect the nucleated cell recovery.  
 
Red Blood Cell – Bidirectional Incompatibility: Patients undergoing transplants for 
bidirectional RBC incompatibility should be managed according to both algorithms shown below. 
Most red cell depletion techniques also deplete plasma from the PBMC component  with no 
additional cell loss. Refer to the  Clinical Coordinator's Patient Information Sheet for instructions 
regarding management of a specific  patient.  
Post transplant blood component support will be according to Standard Practice 
Guidelines.

FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574105] DISEASE (GVHD)  
 
 
Chronic GVHD in allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_450389], Sjogren syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, lichen planus, 
wasting syndrome, bronchiolitis obliterans among others manifestations (see below). 
Approximate ly 50% of patients will develop this complication within [ADDRESS_574106] 2 years after allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation so th at appropriate treatment can be instituted promptly in patients who 
develop chronic GVHD. Debilitation, joint contractures and profound 
immunosuppression resulting in recurrent bacterial infections are prominent 
characteristics of untreated chronic GVHD.  
 
A. Classification of Chronic GVHD  
The purpose of this classification is to identify patients with cGVHD who need long -term 
systemic immunosuppression according to clinical and laboratory findings and risk 
factors at the time of initial diagnosis. In additi on, a morbidity scale has been developed 
to help grade the severity of manifestation of chronic GVHD (Appendix D) at the time of 
diagnosis, when changes in treatment are made and when assessing treatment 
response.  
 
1. Chronic GVHD not requiring systemic tr eatment: mild abnormalities involving a       
single site, with platelet count >100,000 and no steroid treatment at the onset of   
chronic GVHD.   
a) Oral abnormalities consistent with cGVHD, a positive skin or lip biopsy, and no 
other manifestations of cG VHD.  
b) Mild liver test abnormalities (alkaline phosphatase ≤[ADDRESS_574107] 
or ALT ≤3 x upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤1.6) with positive skin or lip 
biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD  
c)  Less than [ADDRESS_574108] aques, macular -papular or lichenoid rash 
involving <20% of body surface area (BSA), dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_450390] <20% BSA, 
or erythema involving <50% BSA, positive skin biopsy, and no other manifestations 
of cGVHD  
d)  Ocular sicca (Schirmer’s test ≤5mm with n o more than minimal ocular 
symptoms), positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD  
e)  Vaginal or vulvar abnormalities with positive biopsy, and no other manifestations 
of cGVHD  
 
2. Chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment: more sever e abnormalities or  
involvement of multiple sites, or platelet count <100,000, or steroid treatment at 
the onset of chronic GVHD  
a) Involvement of two or more organs with symptoms or signs of cGVHD , with 
biopsy documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
2430.00  
 
Page 55 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 b) ≥15% base line body weight loss not due to other causes, with biopsy 
documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
c) Skin involvement more extensive than defined for clinical limited cGVHD, 
confirmed by [CONTACT_9256]  
d) Scleroderma or morphea  
e) Onycholysis or onychodystrophy thought to represent cGVHD, with 
documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
f) Decreased range of motion in wrist or ankle extension due to fasciitis caused by   
[CONTACT_57942]  
g) Contractures thought to represen t cGVHD  
h) Oral involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]  
i) Vaginal involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]  
j) Bronchiolitis obliterans not due to other causes  
k) Positive liver biopsy; or abno rmal liver function tests not due to other causes with  
alkaline phosphatase >[ADDRESS_574109] or ALT >3 x upper limit of 
normal, or total bilirubin >1.6, and documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
l) Positive upper or lower GI biopsy  
m) Fasciiti s or serositis thought to represent cGVHD and not due to other causes  
 
B. Physical manifestations of Chronic GVHD  
Manifestations that are distinctive for chronic GVHD can begin before day [ADDRESS_574110] one manifestation that is distinctive for chronic GVHD ( identified 
by [CONTACT_443964] ) as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, infection and others 
causes must be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD. Karnofsky or 
Lansky Clinical Performance scores <60%, ≥15% weight loss, and recurrent infections 
are usually signs of clinical extensive chronic GVHD. Abnormalities that could indicate 
chronic GVHD are categorized by [CONTACT_443965] ( italic print identifies 
manifestation more distinct of chronic G VHD):  
 
 
Skin Erythema, dryness, pruritis, macular -papular or urticarial rash, pi[INVESTIGATOR_211485] (i.e., hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], vitiligo), mottling, papulosquamous  or 
lichenoid plaques, hyperkeratosis, exfoliation (icht hyosis), nodules, 
scleroderma, morphea (one or several circumscribed, indurated and 
shiny lesions) . The extent of skin involvement and the skin thickness 
score for patients with scleroderma needs to b e recorded at the time of 
diagnosis, when changes in treatment are made and when assessing 
treatment response. Medical photos are also useful for assessing the 
extent of skin involvement and response to treatment.  
Nails   B.     Ridging, onychodystrophy, o nycholysis  
Hair Premature graying (scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows), thinning scalp hair, 
alopecia, decreased body hair

thought not to be caused by [CONTACT_450456], asthma or recurrent 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_450391]. In the 
absence of GVHD in any other organ, the diagnosis of bronchiolitis 
obliterans requires negative microbiological tests from bronchoalveolar

D. Guidelines for Treatment of Chronic GVHD after allogeneic HSCT  
 
We strongly recommend that you consult the LTFU office before beginning treatment for 
chronic GVHD and before making changes in immunosuppressive treatment. Clinical 
trials should always be considered becaus e current standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_450395] (1mg/kg/day) followed by [CONTACT_450459] -day 
regimen, with or without daily cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK506). Other medications 
used for treatment of corticosteroid -resistant chronic GVHD are summarized on the next 
page. Telephone consultation with the LTFU medical te am is available to you, seven 
days a week, to discuss appropriate treatment and provide other follow up 
recommendations. In addition to immunosuppressive treatment, antibiotic prophylaxis 
for encapsulated bacterial infections and PCP must be given to all p atients being 
treated for chronic GVHD (see Appendix E).  
 
The duration of systemic immunosuppressive treatment of chronic GVHD varies but 
requires at least one year of therapy. Approximately 80% of patients require systemic 
immunosuppressive for 2 years an d 40% of them requires therapy for at least 4 years.

 Appendix I  
STUDY COORDINATOR’S MANUAL  
 
I. Introduction  
The mixed chimerism protocols have been opened to multiple si tes to increase the referral base 
and accrual. Because of this expansion of collaborators, the data collection procedures are 
being revised. The procedure manual was created to assure consistency of data reporting 
across the centers and to assure complianc e with regulations. General expectations of 
collaborators are that they will comply with appropriate regulatory requirements, specified 
protocol requirements, and provide outcome data.  
 
The manual translates working procedures for study coordination. Its g oal is to describe the 
procedures with sufficient clarity to ensure that all study centers will use the same procedures 
and follow -up schedules for participant data management and reporting. Changes to the manual 
and relevant forms will be made as soon as practical and will become effective on receipt of the 
revised procedures at the study centers, unless otherwise noticed.  
 
II. Institutional Review Board Review of Protocols and Modifications  
All research protocols proposed for use that involves human subjects must be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) prior to implementation. New protocols will 
undergo review at the FHCRC IRB and then will be distributed to sites that wish to participate 
for their IRB’s review. For Centers th at have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), formal 
collaboration includes submission of a form [ADDRESS_574114] be completed before collaboration on a protocol 
can begin.  
 
In addition, all amendments and/or revisions to on -going, approved activities must be s ubmitted 
for review and approved prior to implementation at an institution. No revisions may be 
implemented at outside institutions without the prior approval of the FHCRC Principal 
Investigator. The FHCRC and the local site’s IRB must review all protocol activities at least once 
annually. This must be done within [ADDRESS_574115] be received for collaboration to continue for 
the next year.  
 
III. Registrations  
Collaborating Institutions: The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_450397]. Registration will include 
completion of the eligibility checklist/demographic form. This f orm will be faxed (206 -667-5378) 
prior to treatment initiation. Patients should be registered prior to treatment initiation for valid 
registration.  
 
IV. Reporting Adverse Events  
The following guidelines are the minimum serious adverse event (SAE) reporting  guidelines for 
Category 1 and 2 studies conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.  
 
Expedited Reporting Requirements  
 
All adverse events (whether occurring on -site or off -site),   which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_450398] (1) unexpected , and (2)  related or possibly related to the 
2430.00  
 
Page 60 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 research and (3) serious or suggests that the research places research participants or 
others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm th an was previously known or 
recognized  must  be submitted to the IRB within ten (10) calendar days of becoming 
aware of the event.  
 
Definitions  
Adverse Event - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a phar maceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
 
Related or Possibly Related Adverse Event:  An adverse event is “related or possibly related 
to the research procedure” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371], it was more likely than 
not caused by [CONTACT_28821]. Adverse events that are solely  caused by [CONTACT_171735], disorder or condition of the subject  or by [CONTACT_450460], disorder or condition of the subject are not 
“related or possibly related.” If there is any question whether or not an adverse event is related 
or possibly related, the adverse event should be reported.  
 
Serious Adverse Event: An adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, 
a life -threatening adverse event (real risk of dying), inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity/or change in psychosocial 
status, a congenital anomaly or, requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or 
damage.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event – An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature (spe cificity), 
severity, or frequency are not consistent with (a) the known or foreseeable risk of adverse 
events associated with the research procedures described in the protocol -related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol, informed consent document and other relevant 
sources of information such as product labeling and package inserts; and are also not 
consistent with (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied including the 
expected natural progression of any underlying d isease, disorder or condition or any 
predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding exist of the differences between the terms “serious” 
and “severe,” which are not synonymous the following note of clar ification is provided:  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) or a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as sev ere headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a patient’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory obligations . 
 
For example, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in general, will not be considered a serious adverse event as 
approximately half of evaluable MRD patients AND the majority of evaluable URD patients 
receiving non -myeloablative transplants were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123324] a 
serious adverse event if it fulfills the criteria for a serious and unexpected adverse event as 
described above.  
2430.00  
 
Page 61 of 89 
FHCRC current version: 09/03/2017  
 Serious events, including deaths, due to GVHD and/or infections will not be reported on an 
expedited basis.  These are well documented, expected, post transplant complications and will 
be reported biannually to the DSMB  
 
FHCRC is acting as the Coordinating Center for this multi -institutional study, and it is the 
responsibility of the FHCRC Princ ipal Investigator (or designee) to complete the FHCRC 
Serious Adverse Event Report for all serious adverse events that meet the expedited reporting 
requirements that are received from the participating sites.  It is the responsibility of the FHCRC 
Principa l Investigator to notify the sponsor, NIH, FDA or other agencies of serious adverse 
events as required in the protocol.  
 
Procedure for Reporting Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events from Participating 
Sites  
Regulations defining the responsibilities for reporting serious and unexpected adverse reactions 
are defined above. SAEs or any death regardless of cause  (serious, unexpected, and

[CONTACT_370433] (See Appendix J ) within [ADDRESS_574117] be 
submitted as soon as the relevant information is available.  
 
Obligation of Investigators  
All grade 3 or 4 adverse events (or highly unusual grade 2 adverse events), which occur 
between start of any protocol intervention and day  100 during the study will be recorded on the 
Case Report Form ( Appendix M) . These adverse e vents which are observed by [CONTACT_450461], whether or not attributed to the study, will be reported on 
the Case Report Form using the  selected (for this protocol) NCI Common Toxicity Criteria(NCI -
CTC) version 4  ( Appendix P ). Attributes will include a description, date of onset, maximum 
severity, and assessment of relationship to the study agent or other suspect agent(s). These 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events will be reported to the DSMB as part of the biannual review of the 
proto col. The DSMB report is submitted with the annual IRB renewal.  
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems that Involve Risk to Research Participants or 
Others:   
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets both of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in term s of nature [specificity], severity, or frequency) given (a) 
the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population 
being studied;  
• Indicates that the research places research participants or others at a 
greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
These must be reported to the FH CRC Investigator within 10 days  of learning of the event as 
described above for reporting of SAE.

FHCRC current version: 09/03/[ADDRESS_574118] be completed for all patients registered onto the protocols and 
submitted to the FHCRC data coordinating center. When possible, primary source documents 
regarding patient outcomes are collected with patients’ names removed and replaced by [CONTACT_450447] (UPNs).  The CR Fs are generated from the collaborating centers at defined 
time points (day 28, 56, 84, 100, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months and annually).  The local PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_450399]. For Outside Centers, c ase report forms 
are expected to be submitted no later than 30 days following the scheduled follow up date. 
When the CRFs are verified, the data is entered into a central database managed by [CONTACT_450462].  
 
VI. Protocol Monitoring  
As the coordinating center, FHCRC will  monitor accrual at the outside institutions. The 
guidelines below are intended to guide the reviewers in their assessment of items that 
significantly alter the clinical effectiveness of the treatment or the evaluation of its toxicity.

cell type, etc.)  
 
B. Informed Consent/IRB Approval Dates  
1. The consent was signed prior to registration  
2. The consent is in language was approved by [CONTACT_8236]’s IRB. IRB approval and 
reapproval are documented including appropriate use of full -board review and proper review of 
appropriate amendments or revisions  
3. Consent was dated and has written witness signature. IRB approval was obtained prior to the 
patient signing the consent form and start of treatment.  
 
C. Patient Eligibility  
1. Eligibility criteria and exclusion criteri a were met  
2. Treatment/Intervention Administration  
3. Doses were modified according to protocol  
4. Accurate documentation of drug administration  
 
D. Study Tests/Evaluation  
1. Protocol specified laboratory tests or diagnostic studies are available  
2. Appro priate record of protocol intervention is documented.  
 
E. Study Events/Adverse Drug Experience  
1. Serious Adverse Evens reported according to protocol specifications  
 
F. Follow -Up 
1. Disease status assessed according to the required protocol guidelines doc umenting response 
to treatment.

a. Study Management:  
1. Each local PI [INVESTIGATOR_443924], training and oversight of local study 
coordinators  
2. The Coordinating Center registers subjects on the study and assigns st udy IDs  
3. One copy of the research data is retained by [CONTACT_779]. Another data set (identified only  
by [CONTACT_443984]) is transmitted to the Coordinating Center to create the master data file.  
All data are kept in locked areas and password protected databases a ccessible only to  
study staff  
4. The quality of data is monitored in an ongoing fashion with the study team and  
corrective action plans instituted as necessary  
b. Data Analysis:  
1. Study staff review data for completeness as it is submitted by [CONTACT_30107]  
2. The study statistician is responsible for data cleaning and the conduct of analyses as  
   outlined in the protocol and grant  
c. Data Safety and Monitoring:  
1. The trial coordinators at collaborating centers or the local PIs will report SAEs (as  
  defined by [CONTACT_760]) to the Coordinating Center and an official report of an SAE is  
faxed to the Coordinating Center within ten days  
2. The SAE report is reviewed by [CONTACT_52488]. If the SAE meets the FHCRC criteria  
for reporting then an official signed repo rt is submitted to the IRB  
3. An independent DSMB will meet at six -month intervals and all outcome data is  
reviewed including all adverse events and SAEs reported to the Coordinating Center  
along with those officially reported to the IRB  
4. A report from the DSMB is submitted to the IRB as well as the trial coordinators/local  
PIs participating in the protocol

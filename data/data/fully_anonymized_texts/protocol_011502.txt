STUDY TITLE:  Safety and dose finding study of different MOD -4023 dose levels compared to 
daily r -hGH therapy in pre -pubertal growth hormone deficient children.  
PROTOCOL 
NUMBER:  CP-4-004 
CLINICAL STUDY 
LOCATION:  The main study is conducted in 7 countries  (Hungary, Bulgaria, Belarus, Ukraine, 
Russia, Greece and [LOCATION_003]), and  at 14 sites.  
The extension study is conducted in all countries except Bulgaria  and Greece . 
STUDY PHASE : Phase 2 
THERAPEUTIC 
INDICATION : MOD -4023 is a long -acting modified recombinant human growth hormone which 
utilizes the C -terminal peptide (CTP) technology  indicated for treatment of 
children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency.  
PRIMARY STUDY 
OBJECTIVES:  The primary objective  is: 
To compare the safety, efficacy , and tolerability of three MOD -[ADDRESS_328208] daily recombinant human growth hormone 
(r-hGH) formulation, in pre -pubertal children with growth failure due to 
insufficient secretion of endogenous growth hormone.  
SECONDARY STUDY 
OBJECTIVE:  The secondary objectives are: 
1. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles 
of 3 different doses of MOD -4023 in pre -pubertal growth hormone deficient 
(GHD ) children.  
2. To select the optimal dose of MOD -4023 for the subsequent phase 3 study on 
the basis of safety and efficacy.  
NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS:  Estimated recruitment will be up to 56 patients (up to 14 patients/cohort)  into the 
Main Study . Patients will be divided into two subgroups: Up to [ADDRESS_328209]  ng/ml and up to [ADDRESS_328210]  and  ng/ml.  
Patients who completed 12 months of treatment in the Main Study and continued 
to the 12-month  Open Label Extension (OLE) period will be eligible to continue 
into the Long -Term OLE (LT-OLE)  period and Long -Term OLE PEN (LT -OLE-PEN) 
periods until marketing approval in their country , subject to an annual notification 
to local EC/IRB of continuation of study , where applicable.  
DURATION OF 
STUDY:  The duration of the  Main  Study is expected to be 12 months  for each patient.  
The OLE period duration will be based on the initial extension of 12 months of 
active treatment  for all patient s completing the Main Study which will be 
extend ed to LT -OLE and to LT -OLE-PEN on a yearly basis until  marketing approval MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Study duration will be until marketing approval; a yearly extension 
request will be submitted to local EC/IRB where it is required. An updated 
informed consent  form ( ICF) for the LT -OLE-PEN period  treatment should 
be signed during the first PEN transition visit, prior to using the PEN  or any 
other assessments related to the transition to PEN.  
SCREENING  
The Screening period will last up to [ADDRESS_328213] be performed and data obtained:  
1. Informed consent/assent signature.  
2. Data on growth history and current anthropometric measurements 
(Auxology).  
3. Body weight.  
4. Medical history, including a description of pi[INVESTIGATOR_221381], 
concomitant and previous medications.  
5. Overall health status asse ssments – complete physical examination, vital 
signs, and ECG.  
6. Pubertal status (according to Tanner stages).  
7. Bone age determination – with the method of Greulich -Pyle using a 
central bone age reader.  
8. Assessment of biochemical markers and stimulation tests:  
 Two different GH stimulation (provocation) tests (insulin tolerance 
test, with  cortisol response to hypoglycemia if insulin stimulation test 
is chosen/arginine test/clonidine test/glucagon test ( with or without 
propranolol)/L -dopa plus propranolol. Sex -hormone priming will be 
performed prior to GH -stimulation tests for girls over the age of 8 and 
for boys over the age of 10. If the patient requires sex hormone 
priming (due to the age), and both stimulation tests must be 
performed during the Screening (no h istorical samples kept, or test 
was without priming), it is recommended to perform stimulation tests 
in consecutive setting in one day, or in two consecutive days, to avoid 
priming the patient twice. Local historical tests without sex -steroid 
priming will not be accepted for patients that require sex steroid 
priming according to the protocol  
 Standard Dose Short ACTH test (only if the patient was not  previously  
assessed for the hypothalamus -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis, or if there are 
clinical or laboratory signs  of adrenal insufficiency ) 
 Assessment of insulin -like growth factor -I (IGF-I) and IGFBP -3 levels  
 Assessment of anti -hGH antibody levels  
 Assessments of routine safety biochemistry and hematology

Key data and all test results obtained during screening will be reviewed by [CONTACT_269690].  
Eligible patients will be randomized (central randomization) to one of the three 
different MOD -[ADDRESS_328215] injection . The following stratification factors will be considered  when 
adding patients to one of the four treatment groups : 
1. Provocation tests peak plasma GH level ( patients with peak levels 
ng/ml and patients with peak levels  ng/ml and ng/ml ). 
2. Patients with peak plasma GH level   ng/ml will additiona lly be stratified 
by:  
a. Chronological age (3 -7, above 7)  
b. Height SDS  - target height SDS ( ≤ -3 and > -3) 
c. Peak GH levels . Patients with peak GH levels 
 can be enrolled in the study.  However , these patients have a 
separate randomization list  
 
PERIOD I: SIX MONTH REPEATED DOSE PERIOD  
During this period , which will last 6 calendar months , eligible patients will receive 
weekly doses of MOD -4023 or daily doses of r -hGH , according to  the table below . 
Safety will be assessed throughout this period , and individual growth assessments 
for each patient will be completed at the end of the period as  described below.

All patients:  
Following the first 6 weeks of the study, all patients will visit the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52123] a 
monthly basis (weeks 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26). Patients allocated to the MOD -4023 
dose cohorts (cohorts 1 -3) will be asked to return [ADDRESS_328220] routine safety 
assessments . In addition, after 5 months of dosing, patients allocated to MOD -
4023 dosing will be asked to return to the medical center in the morning hours 
prior to dosing in order to obtain a trough level MO D-4023 and PD ( IGF-I and 
IGFBP -3) sample s. Patients allocated to the Genotropin dose cohort (cohort 4) will 
be asked to return on any day during the relevant dosing week.  
The following assessments will be performed at indicated time -points (detailed 
schedu ling in section  5.1 of the protocol) : 
Physical examination, vital signs, AEs, local tolerabi lity, concomitant medications, 
parameters of glucose metabolism (fastin g glucose, insulin and HbA1C), other 
hormonal levels (TSH , free  T4, free T3, cortisol), antigenicity (anti MOD -4023 
antibodies for cohort 1 -3 patients and anti hGH anti bodies for cohort 4 patients), 
routine safet y biochemistry and hematol ogy, patient’s  height and weight, 
parameters  of lipid metabolism, pubertal status, I GF-I and IGFBP -3 serum levels, 
fundoscopy.  
During Period I, the dose of MOD -4023 and r -hGH will be adjusted to the patient’s 
body weight every three months. Doses may be de creased for safety reasons 
according to the pre -defined dose -adjustment criteria (which will be based on the 
severity of AEs  or elevated levels of IGF -I). For patients on MOD -4023, the dose 
may be decreased based on repeated day 4 levels of IGF -I above +2 .0 SDS. For 
patients on Genotropin , the dose may be decreased based on repeated IGF -I levels 
above +[ADDRESS_328221] 0.2  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

patient will continue with the same dose, otherwise dose modifications will be 
performed according to th e pre -determined rules.  
PERIOD II: SIX MONTH CONTINUOUS DOSING PERIOD  
The purpose of Period II is to collect an additional 6 months of efficacy and safety 
data. During period II, patient s will be kept whenever it is possible on the originally 
allocated do se levels; however, the dose may be adjusted for safety  reasons 
throughout the study and /or for efficacy reasons  after 6 month s of dosing . 
Patient s allocated to the r -hGH dose group will continue their doses as initiated 
earlier , up to the end of  the 12-month  treatment period.  
Patients will visit the clinic twice during Period II, at months 9 and 12. Period II 
assessments will include the following at each visit: physical examination, vital 
signs, AEs, local tolerability, concomitant medications, parameters of glucose 
metabolism (fasting glucose , insulin , and HbA1C ), other hormonal levels (TSH,  
free T4,  free T3, cortisol), routine safety biochemistry and hematology, patient’s 
height and weight, parameters of lipid metabolism  (month 12 only) , puberta l 
status  (month 12 only) , IGF -I and IGFBP -3 serum levels, fundoscopy  (month 12 
only or earlier if there are signs or symptoms indicative of benign intracranial 
hypertension), ECG ( month 12 only), and bone age ( month 12 only) . 
PERIOD III:  12 Months OPEN LABEL  EXTENSION  (OLE) PERIOD  
All patients who completed 12 months of treatment in the Main Study will be 
eligible to continue to a  12-month  Open Label Extension (OLE) period.  After 
completion of Period II each patient will be assessed individually  for the growth 
progress and overall safety. If the growth meets the pre -defined criteria1 and there 
are no safety concerns, the patient will continue on the same dose, otherwise 
dose modifications will be performed according to the pre -determined rules. 
Patients who received MOD -4023 in the Main Study (initial 12 months of active 
treatment) will continue with the same dose (mg/kg) of MOD -[ADDRESS_328223] every 3 months  (i.e. every 13 ±2 
weeks, 4 days (or 3 days, when necessary) after dosing  until the LT-OLE period . 
Patients who received active comparator, Genotropin , during the Main Study, will 
be switched to MOD -4023  (will be randomized to one of the three MOD -4023 
cohorts ). Their visit  schedule during the first three months of the OLE will be as 
follows: Visit 1 /OLE for first MOD -4023 injection  (week 52 +1 day, which is on 
Month 12 visit of the Main Study ) in which the patient will be trained on 
medication administration , Visit 2 /OLE will be 28 days + 4 ( -1) days after the first 
MOD -4023 injection  and Visit 3 /OLE will be [ADDRESS_328224] MOD -4023 
injection  (i.e. 13 ±2 weeks + 4 ( -1) days after the first MOD -4023 injection) . All 
subsequent visits will be every three months  (i.e. every 13 weeks  (±2 weeks) , on

STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS:  Details of applicable statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
Data from all clinical assessments will be listed and, where appropriate, 
summarized by [CONTACT_9084] s using descriptive statistics. Endpoints will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_269698].  
Summary statistics (a rithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum value, 
maximum value, number of non -missing values) will be presented for continuous 
variables (absolute values at each time point and changes from baseline if 
applicable). Frequency statistics (counts and percen tages) will be presented for 
categorical variables. Where appropriate, the presentation of results will include 
shift tables, plots , or confidence intervals.  
All statistical evaluations, including efficacy analysis, will be purely exploratory; no 
hypothes is tests will be conducted, hence this pi[INVESTIGATOR_269644].  
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of AEs, frequency 
of patients developed anti-MOD -[ADDRESS_328251] year and subsequent analysis will be conducted periodically for 
efficacy and safety updates.  
PK/PD evaluations : 
PK/PD parameters will be calculated utilizing a popu lation PK model ling approach, 
based on limited sampling in each patient.   
The proposed analysis strategy will include the following steps:  
1. Estimate the Population PK/PD means and variances using the Population 
PK/PD analysis .  
2. Perform an Empi[INVESTIGATOR_269645]/PD 
model Parameters.  
3. Use these individual PK/PD estimates to generate individual concentration 
time profile using rich sampling to cover the entire desired time range for 
non-compartme ntal analysis calculation . 
4. Perform Non compartmental Analysis for estimation of AUC and C max . 
PATIENT 
DISCONTINUATION 
RULES  (all study 
periods ) : The patient 's participation in this study may be discontinued due to the following 
reasons:  
1. Request from regulatory agency, sponsor, primary care physician, or 
Investigator.  
2. Patient (or parent/legal guardian) withdraws consent.  
3. Adverse event (AE):  
o Occurrence of a malignancy during the course of study.  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

o Evidence of growth of an intracranial tumor during the course of 
the study.  
o Development of benign intracranial hypertension, if the 
symptoms return following resumption of drug (after a temporary 
stop).  
o Occurrence of AE's following which the Investigator or the patient 
wishes to discontinue treatment (such as,  but not limited to, 
slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_269646], scoliosis, avascular necrosis and 
development of lipoatrophy, etc.).  
o Development of a serious inter -current critical illness.  
o Abnormal laboratory values that affect the patient’s safety (if 
discontin uation is considered necessary by [CONTACT_269699]).  
o A severe adverse drug reaction (if discontinuation of study 
medication  is desired by [CONTACT_269700] ).  If the 
Investigator decision is made because of a SAE or clinically 
significant laboratory value, the Medical Monitor is to be alerted 
immediately  
4. Intake of prohibited concomitant medication.  
5. Unsatisfactory treatment response defined as improvement of  height SDS 
of less than 0.2 SDS in a 6 -month treatment interval if dose increase at 
this time point is not feasible  (Applicable for periods I -IV)  
6. Patient is unwilling or unable to continue the study or is lost -to-follow -up. 
7. Patient is non -compliant with study procedures/ study protocol.  
8. Investigator decides that withdrawal from the study is in the best interest 
of the patient:  
o Occurrence of neutralizing antibodies which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], requires discontinuation of the patient.   
o Lack o f patient compliance (if discontinuation is desired or 
considered necessary by [CONTACT_269701]).  
o A serious protocol deviation that affects the patient’s safety or 
the accuracy and/or validity of data.  
9. Patient meets one of t he exclusion criteria during the study.  
10. Any clinically significant change in the patient’s medical condition.  
Discontinuation rules specific to the LT -OLE-PEN period:  
11. Positive  urine pregnancy test or confirmed pregnancy. In case of 
confirmed pregnancy, the study drug should be discontinued and the 
Medical Monitor be alerted immediately.  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

1. Background and Rationale 
1.1 INTRODUCTION  
Human growth hormone (hGH) deficiency is the consequence of low or absent secretion of 
growth hormone from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_304].  hGH is a 191-amino-acid pi[INVESTIGATOR_269647]-like growth factor-I (IGF -I) into the 
systemic circulation. IGF-I is instrumental in the promotion of linear growth in children, and 
in the control of metabolism and body-mass composition in adults.  It is regulated through 
complex feedback mechanisms involving hGH, insulin-like growth factor-I binding protein 3 
(IGF-BP3) and their complexes. The somatotroph cells of the anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_269648].  Secretion of hGH is under strict hormonal homeostatic control.  Growth 
hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin are the most significant stimulators of its 
production while somatostatin produces the strong inhibitory action.  Both GHRH and 
somatostatin are released into the portal system from the hypothalamus.  hGH has a pulsatile 
and mainly nocturnal pattern of secretion, occurring especially during REM (rapid eye 
movement) sleep.  The frequency and amplitude of pulses increase during the growth spurt 
in adolescence and decline thereafter.  Both acute stress and hypoglycemia stimulate hGH 
release, while hyperglycemia produces the opposite.  
 
hGH is considered to be the most important endogenous factor responsible for body growth.  
It is also under the inhibitory control of IGF-I, its major protein effector, synthesized in the 
liver in response to hGH. The bone and connective tissue, in which hGH stimulates collagen 
synthesis and increases the activity of chondroblasts and chondrocytes, are the effector 
tissues of GH/IGF-I.  GH is not only the hormone of growth; but it shows various effects on 
almost every tissue in the human organism.  It is one of the most important anabolic agents 
enhancing whole body protein synthesis, increasing plasma glucose level and lipolysis via the 
direct effect on adipocytes as well as lipid oxidation by [CONTACT_269702]. New 
research continues to reveal other potential roles of hGH, including regulation of cardiac and 
immune function, mental agility and aging. The far reaching influence of these interactions is 
quite consistent with the very significant pleiotropic consequences for growth and 
metabolism when the system is imbalanced, as in the case of GHD. 
 
In children, GHD results in inadequate circulating IGF-I levels and is manifested as abnormal 
linear growth.   
 
In adults, GHD results in decreased lean body mass, increased fat mass, weakness, reductions 
in exercise capacity, muscle mass/strength, cardiac performance, and bone density, and in 
neuropsychological disturbances.

In most cases, no clear aetiology can be identified. 
 
The idiopathic origin of GHD is poorly understood but it appears to be multifactorial.  
Retrospective analyses have considered familial traits (such as parental height) and perinatal 
risk factors (such as gestational age and birth size and weight) as possible predictors.  
Similarly, correlates of idiopathic GHD with untoward events during pregnancy and 
complications during birth have been examined. There are non-random effects evident in the 
frequency of GHD (and multiple pi[INVESTIGATOR_269639]) dependent on some of these 
apparently extraneous influences, notably traumatic birth experience. The evidence suggests 
a model of causality in which there are ill-defined underlying familial and gender (males 
predominate 3-4:1) predispositions which are exacerb ated by [CONTACT_269703] “adverse” events and 
result in deficiency, the degree of which (isolated GHD or multiple pi[INVESTIGATOR_269651]) is determined by [CONTACT_269704] “adverse” early life event.  
Most morbidity in children with GHD relates to short stature. Average adult height for 
untreated patients with severe isolated growth hormone deficiency is 143 cm in men and 130 
cm in women. The inability to achieve normal height leads to early onset of severe 
psychosocial problems directly related to short stature. This is compounded by [CONTACT_269705], dental and (in males) genital development. Approximately 5% 
of children with GHD have epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221], particularly in infancy. 
Human GH ( somatropin ) has been in clinical use for over [ADDRESS_328275] of care for tens of thousands of adult and pediatric GHD patients and has proved to 
be safe and effective. The safety profile of daily dosing of hGH preparations in pediatric and 
adult populations is well established in clinical trials. Adverse events of injection site reactions 
do occur but are not deemed serious and resolve spontaneously.  Safety is invariably 
concluded to be satisfactory in clinical trials.   MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

The majority of currently available hGH products require daily or every other day 
subcutaneous or intramuscular injections in order to maintain hGH blood levels within the 
effective therapeutic window. Hence, compliance can be a problem, especially in self-
administering patients. Daily administration and its concomitant side effects (e.g., injection 
site discomfort, transient oedema and arthralgia) can limit the therapeutic utility of existing 
formulations. A long-acting form of GH has the potential to reduce discomfort by [CONTACT_269706]. With a baseline of non-
compliance which has been shown to undermine the intended clinical effect of daily dosing, 
at least in the pediatric population, there is a strong imperative to enhance compliance in GH 
replacement therapy. In addition, in pediatric patients, psychological trauma related to years 
of regular injections is one of the major stressors reported by [CONTACT_269707]. The repeated injections required for daily r-hGH treatment may actually 
serve to enhance the negative self-image and stigmatization that already exist for many of 
these children. Patients receiving GH therapy less frequently may experience a benefit from 
such treatment, improving their quality of life. 
At the present time there are no commercially available sustained-release or long-acting GH 
preparations. However, their proof of principle and effectiveness has been extensively 
demonstrated both in clinical trials and in routine clinical use in childhood and adult GHD 
populations.  
CTP technology has enabled the production of a long-acting hGH (MOD-4023), which may 
obviate the need for the numerous injections now required for the treatment of GHD. This 
technology is based on a natural peptide, the C-terminal peptide (CTP) of the beta chain of 
hCG, which provides hCG with the required longevity to maintain pregnancy (initial T1/2 ~10 
hours, terminal T1/2 ~37 hours). The beta chain of luteinizing hormone (LH), a gonadotropin 
that triggers ovulation, is almost identical to hCG but does not include the CTP. As a result, LH 
has a significantly shorter half-life in blood (initial T1/2 ~1 hour, terminal T1/2 ~10 hours). 
MOD-4023 is an hGH molecule fused to 3 copi[INVESTIGATOR_269652]; one at the N-terminus and two at the 
C-terminus. Therefore, adding CTP to protein other than hCG will enable to increase their 
longevity. 
As demonstrated in animal models, healthy subject (Phase I) and GHD adult patients (Phase 
2), MOD-[ADDRESS_328277]  
MOD-4023 is a long acting hGH under development which utilizes the CTP technology. 
MOD-4023 consists of hGH fused to three copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] C-terminal peptide (CTP) of the beta 
chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); one copy at the N-terminus and two copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (in 
tandem) at the C-terminus. Each CTP peptide contains up to four O-glycosylation sites, and 
has a theoretical molecular weight of 30,469 Daltons (Da) for the protein backbone and 
~38, 500 Da for the entire molecule including the O-glycans . MOD-4023 is expressed in CHO 
cells grown in protein-free, serum-free medium. The protein is purified using a series of MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

chromatographic separation steps. The final material is formulated in  
 
Unlike other investigational long-acting/sustained-release hGH products, the liquid 
formulation of the MOD-[ADDRESS_328279] is non-viscous (viscosity at 20 mg protein/ml is 
similar to saline).  Therefore the material can be administered using thin needles of 30-33 G. 
1.3 RISK-BENEFIT A NALYSIS  
Each of the study patients requires GH replacement, and may potentially be advantaged by 
[CONTACT_269708] a safe and effective long acting growth hormone.  
Adverse events (AEs) in children seem to be mostly mild in nature (reported for up to a 
maximum of 10% of the patients participating in clinical trials). Side effects which have to be 
primarily considered when using hGH preparations include: symptoms of fluid retention 
(edema), arthralgia/myalgia, symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome and transient local skin 
reactions at the injection site. In addition, symptoms of hypothyroidism, insulin resistance, 
nausea, increase of leukocytes and plasma free fatty acids, disturbance of blood lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], benign 
intracranial hypertension, headache, muscle and joint pain, weakness, tiredness, 
hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and lipoatrophy (at the injection site) might occur. 
As with any other protein, treatment with a growth hormone preparation may induce 
immune responses, including the formation of anti- hGH antibodies. While growth response 
in children or change of body composition in adults may or may not considerably be affected 
by [CONTACT_269709], it has been a concern with respect to the safety as well as 
the efficacy of such products. Although this  concern historically arose following the use of 
human pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-derived hGH, earlier impure recombinant hGH preparations, and of 
methionylated-r-hGH, assessment of the potential antigenicity of current r-hGH products is 
still ju
stified. 
On the basis of the preclinical studies and clinical studies conducted in adult GHD patients 
(see Investigator's Brochure), serious toxicological reactions are not to be expected in patients 
upon the injection of the study substance at the envisaged dose and route of administration. 
1.4 DOSE SELECTION RATIONALE  
The Phase 2 pediatric study will evaluate three dose levels of MOD-4023, intended to be 
equimolar to the dose level for cumulative weekly r-hGH treatment, or a multiple thereof.  All 
dose levels tested are supported by a significant sa fety margin derived from the “no observed 
adverse effect level” (NOAEL) established in no nclinical toxicology studies. The low dose 
administered to Cohort 1 (0. 25 mg MOD-4023 protein/kg/week) is a weekly molar equivalent 
to a standard daily dose of r-hGH of 0.025 mg/kg/day or 0.18 mg/kg/week (after adjusting for 
the 1. 38-fold difference in mass between the two proteins). Cohort 2 will be administered the 
weekly molar equivalent of the maximal recommended dose for GHD treatment (0.05 
mg/kg/day, based on the Growth Hormone Society Consensus Guideline on the Diagnosis and 
Treatment of GHD in Childhood and Adolescence published in 2000) and Cohort 3 will 
be administered the weekly molar equivalent of the maximal approved dose for other 
pediatric indications (equivalent to 0.068 mg/kg/day). MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

During the 12-month Open-Label Extension (OLE ), patients will continue with the same dose 
(mg/kg) as in the Main Study. 
Patients who received active comparator, Genotropin®, during the Main Study, will be 
switched to MOD-4023; they will be randomized to one of the three MOD-4023 cohorts. 
In the Long-term OLE (LT-OLE) period, patients in the lower dose cohorts (cohorts 1 and 2) 
will be switched to 0.66 mg/kg/week as specified in this protocol. 
In the LT-OLE -PEN period, patients should continue with the same dose.  
1.4.1 Justification for Switching All Patients to MOD-4023 Dose of 0.66 mg/kg/week in OLE 
2nd year 
Based on favorable outcome of the 12-month data of this phase 2 pediatric dose range study 
(Main Study CP-4-004), it was decided to switch all patients from Cohorts 1 and 2 entering the 
LT-OLE (2nd year of the OLE) to MOD-4023 0.66 mg/kg/week. At 12-months (end of Main 
Study), patients on MOD-4023 at a dose of 0.66 mg/kg/week had comparable efficacy and 
safety outcome to patients on daily hGH (Genotropin) at a dose of 34 µg/kg/day (equivalent 
to 0.24 mg/kg/week).  Specifically, MOD-4023 at 0.66 mg/kg/week elicited comparable 
auxology outcome (HV SDS and Ht SDS) and IGF-I and IGFBP-3 profiles to daily hGH while 
maintaining optimal IGF-I serum levels, with values that were in the middle part of the gender 
and age-adjusted normal range (~0 SDS).  The 0.66 mg/kg/week dose of MOD-4023 was also 
associated with a satisfactory safety and tolerability profile which is consistent with known 
properties of r-hGH products.  No patients withdrew from the study due to an AE associated 
with MOD-4023. 
Based on these results, the Sponsor proposes that the dose of 0.66 mg/kg/week of MOD-[ADDRESS_328281] probability to successfully demonstrate non-inferior efficacy to Genotropin in 
a subsequent Phase 3 pediatric GHD study with a comparable safety profile, and is the 
preferable therapeutic dose considering benefit/risk to the pediatric GHD patients.

3. Overall Study Design 
This is a phase 2, safety and dose finding study of different MOD-4023 dose levels compared 
to daily r-hGH therapy in pre-pubertal growth hormone deficient children.  
Eligible patients will undergo the following treatment schedule consisting of a Screening 
period, 2 Active Treatment Periods (Main Study), an Open Label Extension (OLE) period, a 
Long -term OLE (LT-OLE) period and a long-term LT-OLE-PEN period:    
1. Screenin
g period will last up to 6 weeks. 
2. Active treatment period – Main Study: 
a. Period I: 6-month repeated dosing including PK/PD sampling (see Section  5.1.2 for 
schedule).  
b. Period II: an additional 6-month continuous repeated dosing period (see Section 
5.1.2 for schedule).  
3. OLE period (Period III, 12 months) – 12 months continuous repeated dosing of MOD-4023. 
4. LT-OLE period (Period IV, from the second year OLE – long-term annual extension with 
repeated administration MOD-4023 at 0.66 mg/kg/week until transition to P EN. 
5. LT-OLE-PEN (Period V) - long-term, open-label extension using single patient use, multi-
dose,
 disposable pre-filled pen. Upon regulatory clearance and Sponsor's written 
approval, study patients should be switched to PEN. Patient will continue with their 
current dose.  Study duration will be until marketing approval; a yearly extension request 
will be submitted to local EC/IRB where it is required. An updated ICF for the LT-OLE-PEN 
period treatment should be signed during the first PEN transition visit, prior to using the 
PEN or any other assessments related to the transition to PEN. 
 
PERIOD I: SIX MONTH REPEATED DOSE (Main Study)   
Following screening, eligible patients will receive their weekly doses of MOD-4023 or daily 
dose of r-hGH for 6 months repeated dosing including PK/PD sampling. Safety will be assessed 
throughout this period.   
In order to introduce naïve patients to the allocated MOD-4023 dose in a gradual manner, a 
stepwise dose increase will be implemented. All patients randomized to receive one of the 
three MOD-4023 doses will start treatment for 2 weeks with the low MOD-4023 dose (0. 25 
mg protein/kg). Based on the patient's dose allocation, this will be followed by a dose increase 
to the next dose level every two weeks until the final allocated dose is reached.

sampling  
Subsequent to the second dose administration of the targeted dose, limited (population-
based) PK and PD sampling will be performed as described in visit schedules in Section  5. The 
proposed sampling plan is based on the following: 
Selection of time points that will cover both the PK and PD absorption phase to the peak which 
was ab
out 20 hours for PK and 40-60 hours for IGF-I (in the phase 2 study conducted in GHD 
adult patients) and having in addition time points to cover the PK elimination phase and PD 
return to baseline (remaining time points). 
This proposed sampling schedule was tested by [CONTACT_269710]. The results of that fitting 
procedure showed an average of only 15% in the percent error of the true simulating average 
PK/PD model parameters.  
Patients allocated to Genotropin cohort will undergo limited PK/PD sampling after the 8th 
Genotropin dose (start of week 2 of dosing), as described in visit schedules (section  5).  
Following the first 6 weeks of the study, all the patients will visit the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52123] a monthly 
basis. Patients allocated to the MOD-4023 dose cohorts (cohorts 1-3) will be monitored 
monthly for MOD-4023 serum levels, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels and routine safety 
assessments on day 4 after MOD-4023 dosing. In addition, after 5 months of dosing, patients 
allocated to MOD-4023 dosing will be asked to return to the medical center on the day of 
dosing in the morning hours prior to dosing in order to obtain a trough level MOD-4023 and 
PD (IGF-I and IGFBP-3) sample. Patients allocated to the Genotropin dose cohort (cohort 4) 
will be asked to return on any day during the relevant dosing week. 
During Period I, the dose of MOD-4023 and r- hGH will be adjusted to the patient’s body 
weight every three months. Doses may be decreased for safety reasons according to the pre-
defined dose-adjustment criteria (which will be based on the severity of AEs or on repeated 
consecutive elevated IGF-I levels, see section  5.8) . For patients on MOD-4023, the dose may 
be decreased based on repeated consecutive day 4 levels of IGF-I above +2 .0 SDS.  For patients 
on Genotropin, the dose may be decreased based on repeated consecutive IGF-I levels above 
+2.0 SDS. MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

The study Medical Monitor will review all Adverse Events (AEs) from the entries on the e-CRF 
on a weekly basis and all SAE safety reports as received. The key safety data will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_139809] (DSMB) every 6 months  approximately. 
After completion of this period each patient will be assessed separately, for the growth 
progress and overall safety. If the growth meets the pre-defined criteria (delta height SDS at 
least 0.2) and there are no safety concerns the patient will continue with the same dose, 
otherwise dose modifications will be performed, according to the pre-determined rules.   
PERIOD II: SIX MONTH CONTINUOUS DOSING (Main Study)   
During this six-month-continuous dosing period additional efficacy and safety data will be 
collected. During period II, patients will be kept on the originally allocated dose levels/dose 
regimens whenever possible. However, the dose may be adjusted due to safety reasons 
throughout the study and/or due to efficacy reasons after 6 months of dosing . Patient s 
allocated to the r-hGH dose group will continue their doses as initiated earlier up to the end 
of the 12-month treatment period. Patients will visit the clinic every three months at which 
time safety and efficacy data will be collected. 
Derived height and growth parameters (HTSDS and HVSDS) will be calculated centrally, and 
the bone age will be determined by a central bone age reader from the provided copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] X-
ray films blinded for patient’s identity and chronological age. All laboratory samples , including 
samples collected during growth hormone stimulation tests,  will be analyzed centrally.  
PERIOD III –12-Month OPEN LABEL EXTENSION (OLE ) PERIOD 
Patients who completed 12 months of treatment in the Main Study will be eligible to continue 
to a 12-month OLE period. After completion of Period II each patient will be assessed 
individually for the growth progress and overall safety. If the growth meets the pre-defined 
criteria1, and there are no safety concerns, the patient will continue on the same dose, 
otherwise dose modifications will be performed according to the pre-determined rules. 
Patients who received MOD-4023 in the Main Study (initial 12 months of active treatment) 
will continue with the same dose (mg/kg) of MOD-[ADDRESS_328288] every 3 months (i.e. every 13 ±2 weeks, 4 days (or 3 
days, when necessary) after dosing) . 
Patients who received active comparator, Genotropin, during the Main Study, will be 
switched to MOD-4023 (will be randomized to one of the three MOD-4023 cohorts). Their 
visit schedule during the first three months of the OLE  will be as follows: Visit 1/OLE for first 
MOD-4023 injection (week 52 +1 day, which is on Month 12 visit of the Main Study), Visit 
2/OLE will be 28 days + 4 (-1) days after the first MOD-4023 injection and Visit 3/OLE will be 
[ADDRESS_328289] MOD-4023 injection (i.e. 13 ±[ADDRESS_328290] MOD-4023 injection). All subsequent visits will be every three 
months, as for patients who were on MOD treatment in main study. 
Patients who are off treatment for over  between the last MOD-4023/Genotropin 
dose in the Main Study and the first OLE dose (2nd year) will be allowed to continue into the 
OLE period after informing the sponsor and attending an interim visit.

During the OLE period, the DSMB will review the data at month 12  - or on an ad-hoc basis, if 
any safety concern arises. 
PERIOD IV – LT-OLE PERIOD  
LT-OLE starts from the 2nd year of OLE (i.e. the 3rd year of treatment in the study). Patients in 
Cohorts 1 and 2 who are entering the 2nd year of OLE (i.e. the 3rd year of treatment) will be 
switched to the highest dose 0.66 mg/kg/week after signing a separate informed consent. In

the switch to 0.66 mg/kg/week will be done at their next study visit after signing a separate 
informed consent. Patients in Cohort 3 will continue receiving 0.66 mg/kg/week.  
All patients switching to 0.66 mg/kg/week will be required to attend a site visit after [ADDRESS_328294] LT-OLE dose (3rd year) will be allowed to continue into the LT-OLE period after 
informing the sponsor and attending an interim visit. 
Patients will sign a separate informed consent to be eligible to enter OLE and LT-OLE . Patients 
who have already entered OLE will be re- consented for LT-OLE. Patients from Cohorts 1 and 
2 will be instructed by [CONTACT_269711] (0.66

Annual extension notification will be submitted to local EC/IRB. 
Treatment Period V (LT-OLE-PEN) – until marketing approval 
First year of LT-OLE-PEN period 
Upon regulatory clearance of protocol amendment 9 and after sponsor written approval, 
patients will be requested to come to the clinic for PEN visit 1 (PEN V1). PEN V1 will occur on 
a planned dosing day, sites should make any effort to schedule this visit according to the current 
visit schedule and consider to combine visits in order to minimize the burden on the patients . Patient s 
should arrive to the clinic prior to dosing. This visit will serve as the ‘baseline’ for  the LT-OLE -
PEN in which the consent/assent form for the LT-OLE -PEN period will be signed.  Patients 
should return used and unused vials that were dispensed during the study and kept at patient 
home . Site staff should remind the patients to bring all vials dispensed during the study (used 
and unused) before the visit.   
During PEN V1, the patients will be trained on the use of the PEN, the PEN will be dispensed 
and the first PEN dose will be administered at the clinic by [CONTACT_7903]/legal guardians. Patient 
will continue his/her treatment with the same dose level as before the switch to PEN. In 
addition to the PEN, the patients will be provided with updated patient diary,  instructions for 
use and dosing instructions .  
Four weeks (+1 week) after PEN Visit 1, the patients will be required to come for PEN Visit 2 
(PEN V2).  This visit should occur on Day 4 (-1) post dose. Completed patient diary and used 
PENs should be returned at this visit. If necessary, the patient will be re-trained on the PEN .

of an annual extension notification to the local EC/IRB. 
4.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
1. Pre-pubertal child aged ≥ 3 y ears old and not above 10 years for girls or 11 years for 
boys , with either isolated GHD, or GH insufficiency as part of multiple pi[INVESTIGATOR_269654]. 
2. Confirmed diagnosis of GHD by [CONTACT_269713] a peak 
plasma GH level of ng/ml1, determined by [CONTACT_269714] a validated 
assay2. If the patient has already been tested locally and reserve samples that were 
taken at appropriate time-points are available, these will be reanalyzed by [CONTACT_11378]3. Historical tests missing the -30 minutes time point will be accepted. If no 
reserve samples are kept (only for tests performed prior to site initiation),  then the 
details of the locally performed tests will be reviewed by [CONTACT_269715]: [INVESTIGATOR_269640], the patient will undergo both 
stimulation tests during the screening period and the samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_19979]. At least one of the two stimulation tests (and preferably both) will 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_2237]. If the patient requires sex hormone priming 
(due to the age), and both stimulation tests must be performed during the Screening 
(no historical samples kept, or test was without priming), it is recommended to 
perform stimulation tests in consecutive setting in one day, or in two consecutive 
days, to avoid priming the patient twice. Local historical tests without sex-steroid 
priming will not be accepted for patients that require sex steroid priming according to 
the protocol.

4.3 PATIENT IDENTIFICATION  
Parents or legal guardians (as well as patients when relevant) will sign an informed 
consent/assent form prior to any study activities. Upon signature [CONTACT_43998], the 
patient will be allocated a study number comprised of two digits to identify the site and three 
digits to identify the patient. This number will identify the patient throughout the study. In 
the case of re-screening, a new unique number will be allocated. 
Additional informed consent/assent forms will be signed by [CONTACT_269716] , LT-OLE and LT-OLE -PEN periods. 
4.4 SCREENING FAILURES  
Patients who fail to meet the entrance criteria at any stage during the screening period are 
defined as screen failures. All screen failures will be documented on the screening log, which 
documents the screening number, patient ’s initials and reason(s) for  screen failure. The 
screening log will be kept i n the Investigators Site File.  
Screen failure patients will be withdrawn from the study and receive common practice 
performed at the site. Screen failures will be replaced to achieve enrolment of up to [ADDRESS_328307] completed the Screening visit and are assessed as not 
eligible (screening failures) may be considered for re-screening at a later time, subject to the 
Principal Investigator's approval. 
4.5 RANDOMIZATION  
In the Main Study, patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 different MOD-
4023 weekly dose cohorts , or the Genotropin cohort. MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Confidential Document  
The randomization will ensure that the study population will consist of: up to 40 patients with 
peak GH level of  ng/ml  (up to 10 patients per cohort) and up to 16 patients with peak GH 
level of  ng/ml and  ng/ml  (up to 4 per cohort); 
Randomization will be stratified by: 
1. Stimulation tests peak plasma GH level : patients with peak GH level  ng/ml and 
patients with peak GH level  ng/ml and 0 ng/ml . 
2. Patients with peak plasma GH level  ng/ml will additional ly be stratified by [CONTACT_654] 
(patients ≤7 years and patients > 7 years),  height SDS minus target height SDS (distance 
from target height SDS ≤ -3 and > - 3) and by [CONTACT_269717] (  Patients 
with peak GH levels  can be enrolled in the study. However,  these patients have a 
separate randomization li st.  
The randomization will be performed via a web-based electronic data capture (EDC) system 
once all screening data is available and reviewed by [CONTACT_1689].  
In the OLE period all patients will receive MOD-4023. Patients who received M OD-[ADDRESS_328309] withdraw any patient from the study if 
that patient requests to be withdrawn, or if it is determined that continuing in the study would 
result in a significant safety risk to the patient.   
Patients withdrawn from the study after starting treatment with MOD-4023 will not be 
replaced. 
The patient's participation in this study may be discontinued due to the following reasons: 
1. Request from regulatory agency, sponsor, primary care physician, or Investigator. 
2. Patient (or parent/legal guardian) withdraws consent. 
3. Adverse event (AE): 
o Occurrence of a malignancy during the course of study. 
o Evidence of growth of an intracranial tumor during the course of the study. 
o Development of benign intracranial hypertension, if the symptoms return 
following resumption of drug (after a temporary stop). 
o Occurrence of AE's following which the Investigator or the patient wishes to 
discontinue treatment (such as, but not limited to, slipped capi[INVESTIGATOR_269657], scoliosis, avascular necrosis and development of lipoatrophy, etc.).  
o Development of a serious inter-current critical illness. 
o Abnormal laboratory values that affect the patient’s safety (if discontinuation 
is considered necessary by [CONTACT_269718]).  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

4. A severe adverse drug reaction (if discontinuation of study medication is desired by 
[CONTACT_269719]).  If the Investigator decision is made because of a SAE or clinically significant 
laboratory value, the Medical Monitor is to be alerted immediately. 
5. Intake of prohibited concomitant medication.  
6. Unsatisfactory treatment response defined as improvement of height SDS of less than 
0.2 SDS in a 6-month treatment interval if dose increase at this time point is not 
feasible (Applicable for periods I-IV)  
7. Patient is unwilling or unable to continue the study or is lost- to-follow- up. 
8. Patient is non-compliant with study procedures/ study protocol. 
9. Investigator decides that withdrawal from the study is in the best interest of the 
patient: 
o Occurrence of neutralizing antibodies which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
requires discontinuation of the patient.   
o Lack of patient compliance (if discontinuation is desired or considered 
necessary by [CONTACT_269720]).  
o A serious protoco l deviation that affects the patient’s safety or the accuracy 
and/or validity of data. 
10. Patient meets one of the exclusion criteria during the study. 
11. Any clinically significant change in the patient’s medical condition.  
 
Discontinuation rules specific to the LT-OLE-PEN period: 
12. Positive urine pregnancy test or confirmed pregnancy. In case of confirmed 
pregnancy, the study drug should be discontinued and the Medical Monitor be 
alerted immediately. 
13. When the patient reaches a growth rate of 12 months (the interval between 
two height measurements should be at least 6 months). 
 
4.6.[ADDRESS_328311] (or parent/legal guardian 
request) or at the Investigator’s discretion  or fails to return, every effort should be made to 
determine the reason. This information will be recorded on the patient ’s case report form 
(eCRF). All patients who withdraw from the study prematurely, regardless of cause, should 
undergo all early termination assessments (see Section  5.5.2 ). It is vital to obtain follow- up 
data for any patient withdrawn because of an AE or abnormal laboratory test finding. In any 
case, every effort must be made to undertake safety follow-up procedures.

If withdrawal is caused by [CONTACT_269721], it will be reported to the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC) and the Sponsor. 
Any serious adverse event must be reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_49908] 
24 working hours, and to the IRB/IEC according to site’s regulations (see Section  7.2). The 
study may also be terminated by [CONTACT_079] (PI) following consultation with the 
Sponsor. 
All follow-up information will be recorded in the patient's eCRF until full patient recovery is 
achieved, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_269658]. 
Subsequent follow-up will be documented in the patient's personal file.  
5. Study Procedures and Assessments 
No protocol related procedures, including the cessation of prohibited concomitant 
medications, should be performed before the parent or legal guardian provides a writt en 
informed consent and the patients provide an assent (a signed assent for children who can 
read). Study related events and activities including specific instructions, procedures, 
concomitant medications, dispensing of study drugs and descriptions of AEs should be 
recorded in the appropriate source documents and eCRF.  
All visit windows will be on scheduled days or -1 day (except visit 9 main study) for MOD-
4023 
dose cohorts unless it's specified otherwise . The study flow chart provides the summary 
of assessments scheduled for each visit during the Main Study (Appendix 1), 12 months OLE 
study (Appendix 2) , Long Term OLE (LT-OLE) period (Appendix 3)  and Long Term OLE PEN (LT-

prior to GH-stimulation tests for girls over the age of 8 and for boys over the age 
of 10 (for a description of the GH stimulation tests and sex hormone priming, refer 
to Appendix 7). If the patient has already been tested locally and reserve samples 
that were taken at appropriate time-points are available, these will be reanalyzed 
by [CONTACT_2237]1. Historical tests missing the -30 minutes time point will 
be accepted. If no reserve samples are kept (only for tests performed prior to site 
initiation), then the details of the locally performed tests will be reviewed by [CONTACT_269722]: [INVESTIGATOR_269640], the patient will 
undergo both stimulation tests during the screening period and the samples will 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_2237]. At least one of the two stimulation tests 
(and preferably both) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2237]. 
 Standard Dose Short ACTH test (only if the patient was not assessed previously for 
the hypothalamus-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis, or if there are clinical or laboratory signs 
of adrenal insufficiency). 
 Assessment of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) and IGFBP-3 levels. 
 Assessment of anti-hGH antibody levels. 
 Assessments of routine safety biochemistry and hematology parameters. 
 Assessment of hormones (TSH, free T4, free T3 and cortisol). 
 Assessment of glucose metabolism (fasting insulin, glucose, and HbA1C). 
 Parameters of lipid metabolism (with Lp(a) lipoprotein).  
9. Head MRI performed in the [ADDRESS_328315] results obtained during the screening will be reviewed by [CONTACT_269723]. Following 
confirmation of eligibility by [CONTACT_079], the patients will be randomized to one 
of the dose groups.

5.1.3 PK/PD Visits ( V2 - Week 2; V3 - Week 4 ; V4 -Week 6) 
All patients randomized to receive one of the three MOD-4023 doses will start treatment for 
2 weeks with the low MOD-4023 dose ( 0.25  mg protein/kg). Based on the patient's dose 
allocation, this will be followed by a dose increase to the next dose level every two weeks 
until the final allocated dose is reached (see  Table 5) . 
Subsequent to the second dose administration of the targeted dose, limited (population 
based) PK and PD sampling will be taken (according to  Table 6 and Table 7) .  
Patients allocated to a MOD-4023 dose cohort (cohorts 1-3) will be randomized within the 
cohort into one of three blocks and undergo limited PK/PD sampling (4 samples per patient 
over a period of one week), according to  Table 6 below.

5.5 UNSCHEDULED AND EARLY T ERMINATION VISITS 
5.5.1 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits are those visits that will occur between regularly scheduled visits and will 
be performed in order to assess a previously noted adverse event , abnormal/alarming 
laboratory values , and or clinical findings. In such cases, the patient ’s pa rent or legal guardian 
will be contact[CONTACT_269726]. Only focused assessments are foreseen for these visits and there will be no 
need to collect very extensive additional laboratory or other safety and efficacy data. If blood 
collection is required, this should in principle not exceed the volume foreseen for the 
assessment of questionable/targeted parameter(s) and/or should not be over 50% of volume 
foreseen for the routine safety panel at regularly scheduled visits. If urgent or more 
convenient for the patient, a local laboratory can be used.  
According to point 4.5.[ADDRESS_328358] to a trial patient without prior 
IRB/IEC approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. In this case the IRB/IEC will be notified retrospectively.  
5.5.2 Early Termination and End of Study Visits – Main Study, OLE, LT-OLE and LT-OLE-PEN 
Periods 
Early termination visits are appointed for the early termination/withdrawal of a patient from 
this clinical study. These visits may be performed on the same day as originally scheduled 
visits,  or appointed separately. Data collection from these visits should primarily be guided 
according to GCP principles, protecting patient ’s safety and wellbeing . The schedule of 
assessments for early termination and end of study visits (both for patients in the Main Study 
and for those in other study periods ) should follow those requested for the last Study visit MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

possible similar to the last study visit.   
5.6 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Efficacy assessments will be done according to the schedule provided in  Appendix 1 : Schedule 
of Assessments – Main Study.  
Height measurements  must be performed according to  Appendix 9. with a calibrated wall-
mounted (e.g. Harpenden or similar) stadiometer and should ideally be conducted at the 
same time of the day for each visit, preferably in the morning. To ensure consistency of 
results, ideally the same auxologist will perform these measurements for each patient at each 
visit to minimize the variability of measurements. The time of measurement and the 
observer’s name [CONTACT_269805]. The arithmetic mean of three independent 
readings will be recorded for each visit in the CRF. 
The means and the standard deviations (SD) of height for age and gender  for normal children 
will be derived from the standards of Prader et al (Prader A, 1989). 
The HV standardized for chronological age (CA) and gender (HVSDS)  will be determined 
according to the standards of Prader et al (Prader A, 1989). 
Predicted adult height (PAHT)  will be calculated for children above 7 years of chronological 
age using Bayley-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_269659] 6 years and a 
modified Bayley-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_269660] a bone age of 4-6 years (Bayley N, 1952). SD 
scores for PAHT will be based on normative data for adults. 
Bone age (BA)  will be determined by X-ray according to the method of Greulich and Pyle 
(Greulich & Pyle, 1959) at the Screening visit and [ADDRESS_328360] will be taken as outlined in  Appendix 10 and will 
be sent to a qualified central reader . The central reader will be blinded to the CA 
(chronological age), drug allocation, and name [CONTACT_269806]. X-ray films will hold only an 
ident
ification number and gender. Details of the central bone age reader and the procedure 
for blinding and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] X-rays will be provided to the Investigator.

serious adverse events, monitoring of glucose and lipid metabolism, thyroid status, cortisol 
levels, local injection site reactions, antibody formation, regular monitoring of hematology 
and blood biochemistry and urinalysis, regular monitoring of vital signs and physical 
condition. 
5.7.1 Laboratory Safety Assessments 
Analyses of routine hematology, serum biochemistry parameters and urinalysis, glucose and 
lipid parameters, antibody evaluation, IGF-I, as well as hormonal (thyroid and adrenal) status 
will be performed at a central laboratory. 
Additional information regarding the collection, shipment of samples, reporting of results and 
alerting of extreme values will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Special attention will be paid to the monitoring of the following laboratory parameters:  
 Indicators of glucose metabolism; 
 Indicators of lipid metabolism; 
 Assessment of IGF-I levels as safety parameters;  
 Hormonal status with special attention to the thyroid and adrenal status;  
 Assessment of liver enzymes; 
 Assessment of MOD-4023 and r-hGH antigenicity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  IGF-I  
IGF-I will be measured using the IDS-iSYS assay. The assay is based on chemiluminescence 
techn
ology. Samples are incubated with an acidic solution to dissociate IGF-I from the binding 
proteins. A portion of this, along with neutralisation buffer, a biotinylated anti-IGF- I 
monoclonal antibody and an acridinium labelled anti-IGF-I monoclonal antibody is incubated 
for a further period of time. Streptavidin labelled magnetic particles are then added and 
following a further incubation step, the magnetic particles are “captured” using a magnet. 
After a washing step and addition of trigger reagents, the light emitted by [CONTACT_269727]-I in the original sample. 
IGF-I will be assessed according to the schedule provided in Appendix 1 : Schedule of 
Assessments – Main Study to Appendix 5.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of glucose metabolism 
Impaired glucose metabolism may lead to the discontinuation of study treatment. Glucose 
metabolism will be assessed through fasting insulin, fasting glucose levels and HbA1C levels. 
Fasting 
glucose, insulin, and HbA1C will be assessed according to the schedule provided in 
Appendix 1 : Schedule of Assessments – Main Study  to Appendix 5.  
Safety monitoring of potentially impaired glucose metabolism will also include parameters 
that have been associated with insulin resistance (e.g., fasting lipid profiles, changes in blood 
pressure, weight and BMI).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Indicators of lipid metabolism 
In GHD patients, administration of GH has resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat 
stores, and increase in plasma fatty acids. However there still exists a slight controversy about 
potential atherogenic effects of chronic GH replacement therapy. Parameters that will be 
assessed in this protocol are: total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol triglycerides 
and Lp(a) lipoprotein (Lp(a) lipoprotein will not be measured in the LT-OLE- PEN period) . 
Mon
itoring of changes in lipid metabolism may be meaningful from two aspects, as an 
indicator of atherogenesis and as an indicator of insulin resistance. Lp(a) lipoprotein has been 
selected as a potentially challenging parameter. Previously there were reports indicating that 
Lp(a) lipoprotein, as well as the risk of atherogenesis increase under the treatment of r-h GH 
(Mooser V, 1997) (Olivecrona H, 1993), however there were several publications confirming 
that Lp(a) doesn’t change during the GH treatme nt (Hassan HMS, 1995 ) (Hassan HMS, 1996) . MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

One explanation for these contradictory findings could be the high variability of the assays 
used (Wieringa G, 2000), however the effects of sustained release and long-acting growth 
hormones have not been sufficiently investigated.  
Indicators of lipid metabolism will be assessed according to the schedule in Appendix 1 : 
Schedule of Assessments – Main Study  to Appendix 5.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hormonal status with special attention on thyroid and adrenal status 
Cortisol: Blood cortisol should be monitored throughout the study since  GH treatment may 
unmask previously undiagnosed or sub-clinical central hypoadrenalism.  
Supra-physiologic al glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth promoting effect of 
somatropin (as for asthma). Therefore, children requiring a glucocorticoid dose of greater 
than 400 µg/d of inhaled budesonide or equivalents (approximately equivalent doses: 
Fluticasone: 264 µg/d; Beclomethasone: 504 µg/d; Flunisolide 1,000 µg/d; Triamcinolone: 
1,000 µg/d) for longer than 1 month during a calendar year will not be included in the study 
or may be discontinued if additional dosing is required. 
Thyroid hormones: Blood TSH and T4 should be monitored throughout the study since  GH 
treatment may unmask previously undiagnosed or sub-clinical central hypothyroidism. 
Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism attenuates growth and metabolism. Upon diagnosis 
of hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated following 
approval by [CONTACT_269728]. Thyroid dose should be adjusted throughout the study 
so that T4 levels will be close to the median range.  
 
Gonadotrophic hormones - (applicable only for the LT-OLE and LT-OLE-PEN periods) - FSH, 
LH and Estradiol for females that are 12 years old and above and LH, FSH and testosterone 
for males that are 13 years old and above. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of antigenicity 
Immunogenicity of MOD-4023 and of r-hGH will be assessed .   
Baseline data for anti-hGH will be collected at Screening, and no patients with positive anti-
hGH 
antibodies will be included in the study. Baseline anti-MOD levels will be measured at 
Visit 1. During the treatment period, samples will be taken according to the schedule in 
Appendix 1 : Schedule of Assessments – Main Study to Appendix 5.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  MOD-4023 hGH Concentrations 
Samples for MOD-4023 concentrations will be collected according the schedule specified in 
Appendix 1 : Schedule of Assessments – Main Study to Appendix 5 .  
Full blood (and blood smears) will be collected for hematology assessments.  
The following parameters will be evaluated: hemoglobin, erythrocyte count, hematocrit, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), leukocytes, differential blood count of leukocytes, 
platelet count. MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Physical examination, that includes assessment of head (external), eyes, ears, nose and 
throat, lungs, cardiovascular system, abdomen, musculoskeletal system, skin, lymph nodes, 
central nervous system and, where appropriate, other body systems will be performed.  
Physical examinations will be performed according to the schedule in  Appendix 1 : Schedule

5.7.3 Local Injection Site Reactions  
Assessment of local tolerability will be performed by [CONTACT_269729] (by [CONTACT_269730] a reaction is present at the time of a visit) and on the basis of anamnestic data 
and records in the patient diary.  
The abnormal injection site reaction is defined as: 
 Injection site reaction which is observed at the time of visit and moderate to severe in 
intensity. 
 Injection site reaction between the last and present visit, or remaining at the time of 
visit which require medical attention, or injection site reaction resulting from a 
previous injection, other than the last injection. 
 Any other injection site reaction deemed abnormal to the investigator’s judgment, 
other than those ordinarily observed in subcutaneous injections. 
Observations will be recorded on appropriate eCRF pages. If an injection site reaction meets 
the criteria defined for an “abnormal result’” it will be considered an AE.  
 Pain and Tenderness: For patients in all Cohorts, injection site pain will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_269731], and by [CONTACT_7071]/legal guardian if the injection is given at home. The pain will 
be evaluated using the  Pain Rating Scale (Appendix 8 ). In addition, MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed immediately following the written informed consent 
and assent (if applicable) and at all study visits throughout the study. Any AEs that occur 
throughout the study will be recorded. Any new systemic AE that occurs between scheduled 
visits should be brought to the attention of the Investigator and recorded in the patient ’s 
medical file and on the appropriate eCRF page.  
For a list of common AEs associated with human GH, please refer to the Investigator’s 
brochure.  
 
5.8 DOSE MODIFICATION AND DISCONTINUATION  
The following symptoms and laboratory abnormalities measured at a single occasion or 
repeatedly, are considered to be the main guide for the decision about dose modification or 
treatment interruption: 
 Growth factors plasma levels: 
o Repeated consecutive  IGF-I > +2.0 SDS  
 Glucose tolerance 
o HbA1c level > 6.2 %  
o Fasting glucose level is > 5.5 mmol/L 
 Increase of liver enzymes (≥ 2x of ULN)  
 Immune response 
o Development of high anti-growth hormone antibody titre with strong 
neutralizing effect 
 Any other CTC grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality  
 Development of intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri - If a patient has 
persistent severe headaches for more than 1 day not relieved by [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_269664], then examine the patient for papi[INVESTIGATOR_044] (to be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_4674]).  If there is papi[INVESTIGATOR_044],  perform an MRI of the 
head with contrast; if there are signs of intracranial hypertension,  perform a lumbar 
puncture (LP) and record the opening pressure. Only positive MRI findings and 
increased opening pressure on LP confirm the diagnosis of pseudotumor. 
In the Main Study, dose efficacy will be analysed first after 6 months of treatment on an 
individual patient level. Patients who do not achieve the minimally satisfactory growth rate 
(i.e. delta height SDS of at least 0.2) at this time point will be moved to the next highest dose 
group for the remaining [ADDRESS_328370] dose group, the Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_269665].  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may propose one of three options: 
1. If the patient is allocated to Cohort 1 (0. 25 mg protein/kg/week) the following dose 
will not be given. If the symptoms disappear, the patient will continue on the same 
dose level as initially allocated. In case the symptoms reoccur, the patient may be 
withdrawn from the study. 
2. If the patient is allocated to Cohort 2 (0. 48 mg protein/kg/week) the dose will be 
lowered to the lower dose level (0. 25 mg/kg/week) for a 2-4 week period.  The patient 
may be re-challenged, once the symptoms disappear, with the same dose level as 
initially allocated. In case symptoms reoccur, the patient may be kept on the reduced 
dose level.  
3.  If the patient is allocated to Cohort 3 dose (0.66 mg protein/kg/week) the dose will 
be reduced by 15% to 0.56 mg/kg/week.   If the symptoms are resolved, the patient 
will continue on the same dose level. 
In case the AE is persist or the symptoms reoccur the dose will be reduced again by 
15% to 0.48 mg/kg/week.  Patients, who had their dose reduced twice and who still 
have symptoms or they reoccur  will be required to have individual medical 
consultation, depends on AE and /or symptoms assessment.  
It is recommended to consult with study Medical Monitor prior to dose changes (the 
Medical Monitor must be informed of such a change after the event if prior 
consultation is not possible).  
4. Patient will be withdrawn from the study either :  
 Without attempt of dose reduction if such a severe AE(s) develops that may affect 
patient safety and wellbeing. 
 If symptoms do not disappear after the transient dose interruptions or dose 
reductions (Please see case 1-3 above). MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

they should be reported immediately to  Safety Team  and 
evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]. The investigator should document any case of overdose and 
monitor the patient. Parent, or legal guardian training on adverse event reporting will be 
condu
cted at the screening visit and re-reviewed prior to patient randomization and 
additional retraining will be done before entering the OLE. 
5.8.3 Dose
 adjustment paradigm  
Doses may be decreased for safety reasons according to the pre-defined dose-adjustment 
criteria (which will be based on the severity of AEs or repeated, elevated levels of IGF-I SDS).  
The dose will be decreased based on two repeated day 4(-1) levels of IGF-I > +2.[ADDRESS_328375] 
Deviation Score (SDS).  
If a patient has an IGF-I level above +2.0 SDS, they will be requested to return for an 
unscheduled visit within 4-6 weeks after the >+2.0 SDS result, on day 4(-1) post dose.  If their 
IGF-I level is still above +2.[ADDRESS_328376] recent dose will be reduced by 15% (i.e. in case the 
starting dose is 0.66 mg/kg/week, reduction to 0.56 mg/kg/week). The patient will be treated 
with the new dose for at least [ADDRESS_328377] NOT be used for additional dose 
recalculation. At the time of the next visit (or at an extra, unscheduled visit which complies 
with the 4 week minimum time period), IGF-I will be resampled. If the IGF-I is still above +2.0 
SDS, the dose will be reduced an additional 15% (i.e. in case the starting dose is 0.66 
mg/kg/week, reduction to 0.48 mg/kg/week). If the IGF-I is still above +2.0 SDS following 2 
dose reductions (at least 4 weeks after second dose reduction), the sponsor Medical Monitor 
(with the assistance of the DSMB if necessary) will decide on course of treatment on an 
individual basis.  
If AEs are defined as “severe” and drug-related, dose reduction will be introduced upon 
discussion with Sponsor Medical Monitor and DSMB - dose should be reduced at a similar 
manner as above in two step approach.

In all study periods, MOD-4023 will be administered as a SC injection preferably in the 
morning hours once weekly, using the PEN into the upper arms, buttocks, thighs, or abdomen 
(8 locations). It is recommended that all [ADDRESS_328382] been rotated (see recommended rotation scheme in 
Figure 3 below).

OLE-PEN period) . In the LT-OLE-PEN period the patients will use single patient use, multi-dose 
disposa
ble pre-filled PEN containing 20 or 50 mg/mL MOD-4023.  
If a patient on MOD-4023 treatment misses a dose for not more than 72 hours (i.e. the dose 
is ≤72 h late), then he/she will take a full dose as soon as he/she remembers that an injection 
was missed. Then the patient will go back to taking the study medication on the regular day 
of the week. If the dose is more than 72 hours late, the patient will not take a dose for the

week.   
The patient should notify site staff about the delayed injection or the missed dose and be 
instructed by [CONTACT_269737]. 
In case the delayed injection is in the week when an on-site visit is planned, the site should 
confirm that the visit date follows the proper post injection interval (for example: 3-[ADDRESS_328385] dosing, in case IGF-I samples should be collected). If not, the visit date should be 
rescheduled to meet protocol visit dates requirements. In case the injection was missed, the 
on-site visit in that week should be rescheduled, to meet the required post dosing interval. 
In case the prescribed dose cannot be fully set, the patient should be instruct ed how to split 
the dose into two injections. The partial dosing can occur in two cases: 
1. Two injections using one PEN. In case the prescribed dose is higher than the 
maximum dose which can be delivered by a single injection according to the PEN 
concentration, the patient should be instruct ed to subtract the dose already 
received from the prescribed dose and set the PEN accordingly. 
For example, in the mg/ml pen, if the full prescribed dose is  13.[ADDRESS_328386] the dose already received from the 
prescribed dose and set the new PEN accordingly. 
For example, in the mg/ml pen, if the full prescribed dose is 25.[ADDRESS_328387] another 4.5 mg from the new PEN. 
It is recommend to encourage the patients to use a calculator to plan the doses and to 
calculate the dose which should be adjusted for the second injection. 
Patient should be reminded that the injection site should be rotated for each injection. That 
is, for the second injection, whether from the same PEN or a new PEN, the patient should 
rotate the injection site and complete the patient diary page for each of the two injections 
administered. 
Further details are provided in the Patient Dosing Instructions document. 
Patients and parents/legal guardians will be instructed to call the investigator in the event a 
dose was missed and record this information in the patient diary.  During the  
PK/PD period (first 2, 4 or 6 weeks of treatment depending on the dose cohort), any deviations 
from weekly dosing will be considered a protocol deviation. 
Missing/Delayed dose should be reported in the patient diary and eCRF.

6.6 BLINDING  
This is an open-label study. Due to different dose frequencies and dosing techniques, it is not 
practical to employ any blinding methods. A double-blind double-dummy design in this 
particular indication is deemed to be unethical.  
6.7 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
6.7.1 General Guidelines 
All prior treatments received by [CONTACT_25701] 30 days before the initial Screening visit 
will be recorded on the patient ’s eCRF including the treatment's name, indication and the 
start and stop dates. 
Any medications (including prescription, over- the-counter, herbal supplements and health 
store products) to be taken during the study must be approved by [CONTACT_737].  
All approved concomitant medications taken by [CONTACT_269745], along with the indication, and start and stop dates as well as daily dose.   
If the administration of a non-permitted concomitant medication becomes necessary, 
participation in the study may be discontinued. 
Prior medications  will be defined as any medication with start of administration from [ADDRESS_328398] dose of study drug (MOD-4023 or Genotropin) until 
discontinuation of study drug (in all study periods), regardless of the start date for the 
concomitant medication. 
 
6.7.2 Allowed Medications 
The following medications are allowed: 
1. Dose replacement therapy for pi[INVESTIGATOR_269668], but 
doses of all agents must be stable for at least 3 months prior to study entry; however, 
thyroid replacement should be stable for [ADDRESS_328399] a dose of thyroid 
replacement therapy, as needed (after consultation with the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor). 
2. Excessive glucocorticoid therapy may prevent optimal response to somatropin. If 
Glucocorticoid replacement therapy is required, patients may receive hydrocortisone 
in replacement doses. These doses of glucocorticoids (<12 mg/m2/d) will not interfere 
with the growth promoting effects of somatropin and are permitted in this protocol. 
If required, the glucocorticoids may be increased periodically for stress coverage.  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

4. Over-the-counter vitamins, mineral preparations, calcium supplements or 
corresponding dietary supplements may only be taken if their use and dose is agreed 
by [CONTACT_269746].  
All medications must be documented appropriately in the CRF. 
 
6.7.3 Prohibited Concomitant Medication  
The following medications are prohibited: 
1. Estrogen is not permitted as concomitant therapy. 
2. Weight-reducing drugs or appetite suppressants, anabolic steroids, gonadal steroid 
replacement therapy and systemic corticosteroids other than in replacement doses 
are not permitted as concomitant therapy in the main study, OLE and LT-OLE periods 
3. In LT-OLE -PEN period, Psychiatric medications typi[INVESTIGATOR_269669]/or diabetes are not allowed, with the exception of ADHD drugs or 
hormone replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (thyroxin, hydrocortisone, desmopressin [DDAVP]).  
4. The use of any drugs for recreational use (e.g., barbiturates, marijuana, ecstasy, etc.) 
is forbidden.

7.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_102], recorded in the 
patient ’s diary, discovered by [CONTACT_424], or detected through physical 
examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded on the Adverse 
Event Case Report Form and followed-up as appropriate. An adverse event is defined as any 
undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug (or 
therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to the study drug (or therapy). Study 
drug (or therapy) includes the drug (or therapy) under evaluation. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the study treatment are only considered 
adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (any procedures specified in the 
protocol). The period for collecting adverse events begins after signing the informed consent 
form and continues until [ADDRESS_328401] dose of study

Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant or require therapy.  Such 
adverse events are recorded on the Adverse Events Case Report Form under the signs, 
symptoms or diagnosis associated with them.  
Any AE that occurs in the course of a clinical study must be monitored and followed-up until: 
 It has receded 
 Pathological laboratory findings have returned to normal 
 Steady state has been achieved 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic 
measures and follow-up procedures are performed. 
Whenever possible, the Investigator(s) should always group signs and symptoms into a single 
term that constitutes a single unifying diagnosis . The Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_269671], the duration, frequency, intensity, countermeasures and the 
outcome of each AE will be documented. 
The event’s relationship to the study drug  should be indicated according to the following 
definitions: 
Relationship to study drug definitions: 
 
1. Not related   This category applies to those adverse events  which, after careful 
consideration, are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc.)  
2. Unlikely to be related  
(at least two conditions 
fulfilled)  In general, this category can be considered applicable to those adver se 
events which, after careful medical consideration at the time of evaluat ion, 
are judged to be unrelated to the test drug. An adverse event  may be 
considered unlikely related if or when:  
1) It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administrati on 
of the study drug  
2) It could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or ot her modes of therapy administered 
to the patient  
3) It does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug  
4) It does not reappear or worsen when the drug is re -administered  
3. Possibly related  
(at least two conditions 
fulfilled)  This category applies to those adverse events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time of evaluat ion, a connection with the 
study  drug administration appears unlikely, but cannot be ruled out with 
certainty. An adverse event  may be considered possibly related if or when:  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

2) It could not readily have been produced  by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered 
to the patient  
3) It follows  a known pattern of response to the study drug  
4. Probably related  
(at least three 
conditions fulfilled)  This category applies to those adverse event s which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time of evaluat ion, are felt with a high degree of 
certainty to be related to the study drug. An adverse experience may be 
considered related if or when:  
1) It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug  
2) It could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other models 
of therapy administered to the patient  
3) It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are 
important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear upon 
discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists (e.g. 
bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions,  tardive dyskinesia)  
4) It follows a known pattern of response to the test drug  
5. Definitely related  
(all four conditions 
fulfilled)  This category applies to those adverse events which the investigator feels 
are inconvertibly related to the study drug. An adverse event  may be 
assigned as definitely related if or when:  
1) It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug  
2) It could not be reasonably explained by t he known characteristics of the 
patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes 
of therapy administered to the patient  
3) It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose and recurs 
with re -exposur e to drug  
4) It follows a kn own pattern of response to the study drug

Resolved w ith sequelae  Patient  has recovered from the AE with residual incapacity.  
Death  AE was the primary cause of death  
Patient lost to follow -up Outcome is unknown  
 
In the event of any abnormalities considered to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_269747], patients will be followed up with appropriate medical management until the 
outcome is determined or stabilized, according to the Investigator’s clinical judgment.  
 
7.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Information about all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected and recorded on the 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form. To ensure patients’ safety each SAE must also be 
reported to  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  
An SAE is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 
1. Is fatal or life-threatening. 
2. Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
3. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
4. Constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect. 
5. Is medically significant, in that it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Events not to be reported as SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, like training for the study drug administration, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269675]. 
 Treatment, which was elective or pre-planned for a pre-existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen. MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

 Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_269676]. 
 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
aforementioned definitions of “serious” and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105904].  
The period for collecting and reporting SAEs for this study starts after the patient has provided 
assent (where applicable) and the parent(s)/guardian(s) has provided written informed 
consent, and continues until the formal end of study-notification . 
7.2.1 Notification of Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting responsibility 
Each serious adverse event (SAE) must be reported by [CONTACT_269748] [ADDRESS_328407] further information 
from the investigator. This is essential for collecting information to report to the competent 
regulatory authority (RA). All safety information obtained will be provided to the DSMB for 
review and assessment. The DSMB in collaboration with the sponsor will assess any suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) occurring during the study to determine 
whether additional risks are imposed on patients and make a decision as to suspending 
further enrollment until a final decision has been made. The Sponsor may need to issue an 
investigator notification, to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug 
(or therapy) that this S[LOCATION_003]R has occurred. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting procedures 
The investigator must complete the Serious Adverse Event Report Form in English, assess the 
relationship to study treatment, and submit it electronically via eCRF within 24 hours to 
 CRO.  
Follow-up information is to be submitted on a new SAE Form . The new form should clear ly 
state that i t is a follow-up to the previously reported SAE and give the date of the original 
report. The follow-up SAE report should describe whether the event has resolved or 
continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the patient continued or discontinued study 
participation.

source document may be sent if required. The patient ’s personal details will be removed and 
replaced with study identifiers i.e. study number and initials, if applicable. 
Reporting of SAEs and other relevant safety information to the Health Authorities, Ethics 
Committees, Principal and Coordinating Investigators and Trial Investigators required by [CONTACT_269750]-mentioned functionaries and institutions will be fulfilled according to the current local 
laws and guidance. The detailed reporting duties and division of responsibilities between the 
sponsor and  CRO will be detailed in a separate document (Medical Management 
Manual). Once an event has been assessed as a S[LOCATION_003]R, then information must meet the 
expedited reporting requirements to the local regulatory authorities. The investigator is 
obliged to familiarize herself/himself with the reporting requirements for investigators in 
her/his country. The monitor can help with this.

If a patient were to become pregnant or thinks she may have become pregnant during the 
study, study physician should be informed immediately, such information will be recorded in 
study documentation and the patient will be asked to stop taking the study medication as it 
may cause unforeseen risks to the unborn baby. Serum pregnancy test will be scheduled 
immediately in such cases, and in the case of the negative result the test should be repeated 
in [ADDRESS_328412] results the patient 
will be offered to remain in the study and complete the remaining study procedures as 
scheduled. The pregnancy will be reported to the Medical Monitor, pharmacovigilance and

8.1 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Details of applicable statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Data from all clinical assessments will be listed and, where appropriate, summarized by [CONTACT_269751]. Endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_269752].  
Summary statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum value, lower quartile, 
median, upper quartile, maximum value, number of non-missing values) will be presented for 
continuous variables (absolute values at each time point and changes from baseline if 
applicable). Frequency statistics (counts and percentages) will be presented for categorical MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

variables. Where appropriate, the presentation of results will include shift tables, plots or 
confidence intervals.  
All statistical evaluations, including efficacy analysis, will be purely exploratory; no hypothesis 
tests will be conducted, hence this pi[INVESTIGATOR_269644]. 
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of AEs, frequency of patients 
developed anti-MOD-4023 antibody and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside 
of pre-determined ranges. Data of all safety endpoints will be listed and tabulated. 
When all patients complete the Main Study a full analysis (CSR) will be performed based on 
the SAP. 
When all patients will complete the second year of treatment an additional analysis will be 
performed. 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE  
There are no previous pediatric GHD patients for MOD-4023 available to support a formal 
sample size calculation . 
A sample size of 12 patients per cohort has been chosen in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_115834] (14 patients 
will be enrolled to get 12 per protocol evaluable patient in each cohort). Each cohort is 
stratified according to peak GH levels with up to [ADDRESS_328415] GH 
levels ≤7 ng/ml and up to 4 patients with peak GH levels  and  ng/ml. The justifications 
for this sample size are based on rationale about feasibility; precision about the mean and 
variance; and regulatory considerations as described by (Julious, 2005). 
 
The selected sample size is large enough that there is about a 50% chance of identifying at 
least 1 patient in the cohort who experiences a treatment emergent adverse event where the 
nature of the event is such that the true chance that a patient has this type of an event during 
the treatment period is 5%.  
 
If the true chance that a patient has event 
during the treatment period is : then the chance of identifying at least 1 patient 
who experiences the event during the treatment 
period is : 
5 % 50%  
10 %  78%  
15 %  90%  
20 %  96%  
 
When combining all MOD-4023 patients (n= 42) there is about a [ADDRESS_328416] 1 patient in the entire group of patients treated with MOD-4023 who 
experiences a treatment emergent event where the nature of the event is such that the true 
chance that a patient has this type of an event during the treatment period is 5%.

8.3 POPULATION ANALYSIS  
The data from randomized patients who did not receive any study medication will be excluded 
from the statistical analysis and will only be listed individually in the Appendix of the final 
study report. 
The following data subsets will be analyzed: 
Safety analysis subset (SAS) 
The safety analysis set will include all randomized patients who have received at least one 
dose of active treatment. 
Full analysis subset (FAS) 
The term “full analysis subset” is used to describe the analysis set which is as complete as 
possible and as close as possible to the intention- to-treat (ITT) ideal of including all 
randomized patients.  
The full analysis set will comprise all randomized patients who have received at least one dose 
of active treatment and who provide any follow-up data for the primary target variables.  
Per protocol subset (PP) 
The basis of PP subset is the full analysis set. 
Handling of drop-outs and missing values will be performed as for the full analysis dataset. 
Protocol deviations excluding patients from the Per Protocol analysis set will be defined in the 
statistical analysis plan and will include failure to satisfy inclusion or exclusion criteria, taking 
any not permitted concomitant medication during the study, serious non-compliance. 
8.3.1 Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Assessments made at the screening and baseline visits will be summarized by [CONTACT_6490]. These assessments will include demographic characteristics and other relevant 
parameters and prognostic factors. By-treatment summaries will serve to identify any 
imbalances between the treatment groups at baseline. Summary tables will be provided for 
the full analysis set, for the per-protocol analysis set and for the safety analysis set by [CONTACT_269753], where appropriate. In accordance with Altman, 
no significance tests will be performed to assess baseline comparability. 
8.3.2 Study Medication 
For each patient, the individual extent of exposure will be calculated in terms of:  
 Total duration of treatment  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

These variables will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], sorted by [CONTACT_269754]. 
Summary statistics per treatment group will be tabulated. 
Study drug compliance will be calculated as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. It will be 
listed by [CONTACT_269755].  
8.3.3 Concomitant Therapy 
Previous and current medication will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335], overall (any 
pervious or current medication) and per WHO-DRL category. This table will include those 
medications reported on the “Previous and current medication (all visits)” CRF, which have a 
stop date prior to the date of first administration of study medication. All other medication 
entered on these CRF pages will be considered as concomitant medication. 
Previous and current non-medicinal therapy will be handled and tabulated in the same way 
as specified above for previous and current medication. 
8.4 EFFICACY EVALUATION  
The secondary and  efficacy endpoints related to IGF-I and IGFBP-3 assessments 
will be subsumed under biochemical endpoints and may serve as pharmacodynamic 
endpoints. 
EFFICACY ENDPOINTS:  
Primary endpoints (Main study): 
 Annual Height Velocity in cm/year at 12 months (Baseline Visit – Visit 1). 
Secondary endpoints (Auxology/Clinical) (Main study): 
 Height velocity at 6 months (Baseline Visit – Visit 1); 
 Delta height SDS at 6 and 12 months (compared to visit 1/Baseline  value). 
Secondary endpoints (Biochemical) ( All study periods ): 
 Absolute IGF-I levels on day 4 after MOD-4023 dosing; 
 IGF-I SDS on day 4 after MOD-4023 dosing.

8.4.1 Methods of Efficacy Analysis 
The efficacy analysis will be exploratory, and based upon descriptive summary statistics , 
confidence intervals, exploratory nature statistical tests and graphical data presentations. For 
those parameters (IGF-I or other pharmacodynamic parameters subsumed under secondary 
biochemical endpoints) in which the analysis reveals that a consideration of extent of 
availability – similar to PK parameters – seems to be a meaningful supplement to the usual 
descriptive statistics, additionally, appropriate areas under the time-concentration curves 
may be defined and determined. 
The effect of dose or dose group on the primary and secondary efficacy criteria subsumed 
under biochemical endpoints may be analyzed using ANOVA (analysis of variance) method s. 
Primary and secondary clinical endpoints will be calculated using SAS or other validated 
software and these endpoints may be analyzed using ANOVA methods in order to compare 
the treatment arms. 
The efficacy analysis will be performed based upon the FAS and PP subsets and subgroups 
based on peak hGH level following stimulation tests. 
SAFETY ENDPOINTS: (All study periods)  
 Incidence of adverse events; 
 Incidence of anti-MOD-4023 antibody formation (including characterization of the 
antibodies and neutralizing properties); 
 Local injection site assessment; 
 IGF-I levels; 
 Parameters of glucose metabolism: blood glucose, fasting insulin level, HbA1c; 
 Thyroid status; 
 Lipid parameters;  
 Cortisol levels; 
 All other hematology and biochemical parameters; 
 Physical examination; 
 Vital signs. 
8.5 SAFETY E VALUATION  
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of AEs, frequency of anti-
MOD-4023 antibody development and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside 
of laboratory normal ranges. Other safety data (e.g. vital signs, special tests, etc.) will be 
considered as appropriate. 
AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_269756]. AEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage of patient s 
having any AE, having an AE in each body system and having each individual AE. Any other MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

information collected (e.g. severity or relatedness to study medication) will be listed as 
appropriate. 
Summaries and analyses will be based on treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), which 
are defined as AEs occurring after the first administration of study medication (as recorded 
on the study discontinuation / end of study CRF) or AEs present before the first dose and 
ongoing after administration with increased severity. Other AEs (pre-treatment AEs) will only 
be listed. 
If appropriate, laboratory and/or ECG data will be summarized by [CONTACT_269757] (baseline to most extreme post-baseline value), by [CONTACT_269758] (means, medians, standard deviations, ranges) and change 
from baseline values and by [CONTACT_269759]. 
Blood glucose, HbA1c, cortisol, thyroid panel tests and lipid panel tests (with special attention 
on LpA) will be evaluated using standard descriptive statistics, the number of patients who 
had values outside normal values, and by [CONTACT_269760].  
Data from other tests (e.g. blood pressure or vital signs) will be listed, notable values will be 
flagged, and any other information collected will be listed as appropriate. Summary statistics 
will be given where appropriate.  
In addition the number and percentage of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_269677], including 
neutralizing antibodies, will be summarized by [CONTACT_9084].  
Local tolerability will be summarized based on the investigat or’s assessments of pain, 
tenderness, erythema, warmth and swelling which will be done by a scale and predetermined 
schedule during intensive PK/PD sampling. 
The safety analysis will be performed based upon the safety analysis subset.  
8.6 PK/PD  EVALUATION  
PK/PD parameters will be calculated utilizing a population PK modeling approach, based on 
limited sampling in each patient.  
The proposed analysis strategy will include the following steps: 
1. Estimate the Population PK/PD means and variances using the Population PK/PD 
analysis .  
2. Perform an Empi[INVESTIGATOR_269645]/PD model 
Parameters.  
3. Use these individual PK/PD estimates to generate individual concentration time profile 
using rich sampling to cover the entire desired time range for Non compartmental 
Analysis calculation. 
4. Perform Non compartmental Analysis for estimation of AUC and Cmax.

 Probabilistic checks; and 
 Protocol adherence checks. 
It is the responsibility of the study site and investigator to resolve all data queries that arise 
during data validation in a timely manner. 
When all study data is collected, and the database is complete and accurate, a database 
quality control (QC) check is performed on 100% of key safety and efficacy (critical) variables 
and portion of randomly selected non‐critical variables. If all critical and selected non‐critical 
data is quality checked and the error rate is acceptable the database can be locked. Any 
changes to the database after that time can only be made by [CONTACT_269779] t 
between the Sponsor, the Statistician and the Clinical Data Manager.

Appendix 6: World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI - Ethical Principles for Medical 
Research Involving Human Subjects 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by 
[CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_328472] WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 
added) 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added) 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
A. INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of 
Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving 
human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent 
paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant 
paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA 
encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to 
adopt these principles. 
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, 
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, 
"The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International 
Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the patient's best 
interest when providing medical care." 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies 
involving human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical 
research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual 
research subject must take precedence over all other interests. 
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to 
understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve 
preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

Confidential Document  
and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, 
accessibility and quality. 
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks 
and burdens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights. Some research 
populations are particularly vulnerable and need special protection. These 
include those who cannot give or refuse consent for themselves and those who 
may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and 
standards for research involving human subjects in their own countries as well 
as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international 
ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the 
life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and 
confidentiality of personal information of research subjects. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally 
accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the 
scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate 
laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of 
animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that 
may harm the environment. 
14. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects 
must be clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain 
a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the 
principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include 
information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, other 
potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of 
participation in the research study. The protocol should describe 
arrangements for post-study access by [CONTACT_269791]. 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, 
guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. 
This committee must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

other undue influence. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations 
of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as 
applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed 
to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in 
this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing 
studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the 
committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No 
change to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by 
[CONTACT_942]. 
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by 
[CONTACT_62383]. Research 
on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and 
appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. The 
responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the 
physician or other health care professional and never the research subjects, 
even though they have given consent. 
17. Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or 
community is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs 
and priorities of this population or community and if there is a reasonable 
likelihood that this population or community stands to benefit from the results 
of the research. 
18. Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by 
[CONTACT_269792]. 
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly accessible database before 
recruitment of the first subject. 
20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects 
unless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately 
assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop 
a study when the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when 
there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results. 
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the 
importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the 
research subjects.

23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and 
the confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of 
the study on their physical, mental and social integrity. 
24. In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of 
funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the 
researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the 
discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant aspects of the study. The 
potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the 
study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of 
individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the 
information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the 
information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must 
then seek the potential subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in 
writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written consent 
must be formally documented and witnessed. 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians 
must normally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. 
There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to 
obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. 
In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and 
approval of a research ethics committee. 
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the 
physician should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a 
dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In 
such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_11274]. 
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals 
must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for 
them unless it is intended to promote the health of the population represented 
by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with 
competent persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal 
burden. 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek 
that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
The potential subject's dissent should be respected. 
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving 
consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary 
characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician 
should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no 
such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific 
reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to 
give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally 
authorized representative. 
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly 
available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable 
for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to 
accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as 
positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available. 
Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be 
declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical care only to the 
extent that the research is justified by [CONTACT_151084], diagnostic or 
therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that 
participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the 
patients who serve as research subjects. 
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be 
tested against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the 
following circumstances:  
 The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no 
current proven intervention exists; or 
 Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons 
the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of 
an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment 
will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme 
care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to 
be informed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that 
result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in 
the study or to other appropriate care or benefits. MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are 
related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the 
patient's decision to withdraw from the study must never interfere with the 
patient-physician relationship. 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have 
been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed 
consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an 
unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving 
life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, this 
intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its 
safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

Appendix 7: Growth Hormone Stimulation Tests and Other Assessments 
Growth Hormone Stimulation Tests 
As stated in the 2000 Growth Hormone Research Society Consensus Guideline: “In a child with 
clinical criteria for GHD, a peak GH concentration less than  ng/ml has traditionally been 
used to support the diagnosis . At the present time, a new GH reference standard is being 
introduced that may require a downward adjustment of the lower limit of normal” (Growth 
Hormone Research Society Consensus Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Growth 
Hormone (GH) Deficiency in Childhood and Adolescence (2000))1. 
The new standard is currently used in the [LOCATION_003] and EU. However, the common clinical practice 
remains to treat patients with GH below ng/ml. The cutoff for this study is in line with this 
common clinical practice. 
Two different GH-stimulation tests will be done to confirm the diagnosis and eligibility of 
patients. At least one of the two stimulation tests (and preferably both) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_2237]. 
Sex Hormone Priming  
Prior to the stimulation tests performed during the screening period, sex hormone priming 
will be performed as follows:  
Boys - A single dose of [ADDRESS_328479] (a total of 10 doses) or Beta estradiol will be given as [ADDRESS_328480] (a total of 3 doses). 
If the patient requires sex hormone priming (due to the age) and both stimulation tests must 
be performed during the Screening (no historical samples were kept, or the test was without 
priming), it is recommended to perform stimulation tests in one of the following two settings, 
so as to avoid priming the patient twice. Local historical tests without sex-steroid priming will 
not be accepted for patients that require sex steroid priming according to the protocol.  
It is possible to perform combined growth hormone stimulation tests, in the two following 
ways, so as to avoid priming the patient twice:  
a) Perform two GH stimulation tests in a consecutive setting, in one day: immediately after 
drawing the last sample of the first test the stimulating agent of the second test will be 
given (there is no need for the -[ADDRESS_328481] ). After most of the tests , 
patients need some time to rest (ITT, glucagon), and are even sleepy (clonidine), so the 
second test performed immediately after the first one brings no additional discomfort. In 
this setting, one priming is to be performed, before the first test only. 
b) Perform two GH stimulation tests in two consecutive days, with the sex hormone priming 
before the first test only; female patients should then have one additional day of receiving

Ethinylestradiol (2 additional doses) or Beta estradiol (1 additional dose), before the 
second stimulation test. 
The investigator, together with parents/legal guardians, will make the decision which one 
is more convenient for the patient. 
Insulin Tolerance Test 
Regular human insulin (0.10-0.15 IU/kg) will be administered intravenously (i.v.) at time point 
0. The test will be interpretable if the blood glucose level decreases below 40 mg/dL. 
Administration of i.v. dextrose will be allowed if the patient develops severe signs of 
hypoglycemia. ITT is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizures or coronary artery 
disease. 
Blood will be collected at the following intervals: t = – 30, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min 
(8 sampling points) for glucose, hGH and cortisol determination.  
A normal ACTH reserve is defined as a baseline cortisol level above 190 nmol/l (7 μg/dL) or an 
increase in peak cortisol level above 500 nmol/l (18 μg/dL).  
Clonidine test 
After fasting overnight, clonidine (0.15 mg/m2 body surface, given orally) will be given at time 
t = 0, and venous blood will be obtained by [CONTACT_269793] a cubital vein 
and kept patent by [CONTACT_269794]. Blood will be collected at 30 min intervals, 
between t = - 30 to +150 min (7 sampling points) for hGH measurement. Caution should be 
exercised when performing this test however, as clonidine causes side effects such as 
tiredness and decreased blood pressure. Thus, blood pressure must be monitored prior to, 
and up to [ADDRESS_328483] 
Soluble arginine hydrochloride (0.5 g/kg) will be given i.v. from time t = 0 to t = [ADDRESS_328484]. Blood samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_269793] a 
cubital vein and kept patent by [CONTACT_269794]. Blood will be collected at the 
following intervals: t = –30, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min (8 sampling points) for hGH 
measurement.  
Glucagon test 
After fasting overnight, glucagon (0.03 mg/kg with a maximal total dose of 1 mg) will be given 
i.m. or s.c. at time t = 0, and venous blood will be obtained by [CONTACT_269795] a cubital vein and kept patent by [CONTACT_269794]. Blood will be collected for 
hGH measurement at -30, 0, 60, 90, 120, [ADDRESS_328485] is not recommended for assessing the cortisol status. However, a normal ACTH 
reserve can be defined as a peak cortisol level above 500 nmol/l (18 μg/dl). If the peak cortisol 
level reached during the glucagon test (referring to a historical test only) is lower, then an 
ACTH stimulation test is needed to confirm the diagnosis of hypoadrenalism.  MOD-4023 | CP-4-004 | CP-4-004_Protocol for Clinical Study _ Amendment 9_PEN |

L-Dopa test 
After fasting overnight L-Dopa will be given orally at time-point t=0 in dose of 125 mg if body 
weight is less than 15 kg, else 250 mg if body weight is less than 35 kg, else 500 mg if body 
weight is greater than 35 kg. Blood samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_269796] a cubital vein and kept patent by [CONTACT_269794]. Blood will be 
collected at the following intervals: –30, 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. 
Cortisol levels  
Screening serum cortisol (in conjunction with a screening ITT for GH reserve; or glucagon test) 
and routine follow-up serum cortisol will be determined in ALL screened patients 
with/without pre-existing central hypoadrenalism, and additional serum cortisol will be 
determined when there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_269686]-existing central hypoadrenalism. Screening ACTH stimulation (Standard Dose Short 
ACTH test) will be performed only in patients without pre-existing central hypoadrenalism, 
and additional ACTH stimulation tests will be performed when there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_269687]. 
The Standard Dose Short ACTH test will be performed after overnight fasting. An i.v. catheter 
will be inserted into the cubital vein; a baseline sample for serum cortisol will be taken and 
then the set will be heparinized. Subsequently, [ADDRESS_328487] dose.  
If the cortisol level remains below 18 μg/dL (500 nmol/L) at both post -dose time-points, the 
child should be investigated outside of this protocol for primary or secondary adrenal 
insufficiency. Associated clinical symptoms like lethargy, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], shock, hypoglycaemia, eosinophylia and electrolyte imbalance 
will further emerge the need for the investigation of adrenal insufficiency.  
Assessment of pubertal status 
Pubertal status will be documented by [CONTACT_269797] 1.  Boys will be assessed for descent of the testes and testis volumes, girls for the 
breast development according to Tanner stages (Tanner JM, 1976). Pubic hair rating will also 
be recorded according to Tanner stages.

1. Use a wall-mounted calibrated stadiometer. 
2. Patients should not stretch prior to height determination. 
3. The patient must be standing without shoes. 
4. The patient should be wearing only light clothing so that the patient's pose can be 
observed.  
5. The patient's gaze must be forward and horizontal. (Frankfurt position) 
6. Heels must be placed together. -If the patient has genu valgum (knock-knee), the 
knees must be in contact [CONTACT_269798].

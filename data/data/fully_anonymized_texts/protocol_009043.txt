 1.0     PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
This is prospective  double -arm, randomized  cross -over clinical  trial that will assess  whether  the 
addition  of a local analgesic  agent,  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319],  to the standard  of care of propofol  will reduce  
the percentage  of pediatric  neuroblastoma  patients  who require  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828951] . A “bone  marrow  procedure”  will be defined  as 
[ADDRESS_1150482]  of care (Intervention  A) or the standard  of care with the addition  of 
subcutaneous  and periosteal  infiltration  of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (Intervention  B). We will compare  the 
percentage  of patients  requiring  post-procedural  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828952],  as well as total opi[INVESTIGATOR_174056],  time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480],  percentage  requiring  
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_828953],  standardized  pain scores  and quality  of life metrics.  Based  on statistical  
considerations  and extrapolation  from an informal  needs  assessment,  we  expect   to  enroll  
enough  patients  for adequate  power  within  [ADDRESS_1150483]

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Objective:  
 
• Determine  whether  there  is a reduction  in the percentage  of pediatric  neuroblastoma  
patients  undergoing  a bone  marrow  procedure  who require  post-procedural  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828956]  24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  of the procedure  with the addition  of local 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
Secondary  Objective:  
 
Determine  whether  there  is a difference  in: 
 
• 24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  post-procedure  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828957]  
(mg/kg/day)  
• Percentage  of patients  requiring  non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_828958]  24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  of 
procedure  
• Standardized  pain scores  (Wong -Baker  FACES®    Scale)  
• Time  to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_783034]  
• Short -term quality  of life 
• Adverse  outcomes  with the addition  of local ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Background  
 
Pediatric  neuroblastoma  patients  undergo  bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  (BMA)  and biopsy  
(BMB)  procedures  as a part of their extent  of disease  evaluation  at regular  intervals  during  
treatment  and surveillance.  Many  studies  of both pediatric  and adult oncology  patients  have 
shown  that bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_828959]  .1-3 Not only do patients  
report  procedural  pain,  but health  care professionals  and parents  also acknowledge  that these  
procedures  are painful.  A study  asked  Italian  Pediatric  Hematology -Oncology  health  
professionals  (medical  directors,  physicians,  nurses,  psychologists)  their perceptions  of 
procedural  pain and found  that providers  considered  BMA  and BMB  to be above  5 on a scale  of 
0-10 in 97.5%  and 99.5%  of cases,  respectively.[ADDRESS_1150485]  frequent  cause  of distress.5 
Exposure  to repeated  painful  procedures  has been  found  to exacerbate  anxiety  and distress  in 
children.6,7 
The American  Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP)  developed  a report  in 1990  stating  that 
strategies  to reduce  pain and anxiety  are integral   to the care of pediatric  oncology  patients.8 
Pediatric  oncology  departments  such  as the Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC) 
Department  of Pediatrics  have adopted  institutional  practices  in an effort  to reduce  bone -marrow  
procedure -related  pain and anxiety.  The standard  of care at MSKCC  for pediatric  patients  
undergoing  BMA  and BMB  is to receive  propofol.  While  propofol  has amnestic  and anesthetic  
properties,  it lacks  any analgesic  properties.9 
Page  5 of 23 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -1417 A(3)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1150486]  of care administration.  We 
found  that 8/26 = 30.7%  of patients  required  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828958]  24 hours  of the procedure  - 
7/[ADDRESS_1150487]-procedurally  and one patient  with systemic  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828960].  We also 
discovered  that many  children  had persistent  pain and reduced  activity  level the day following  
the procedure  - 12/26  = 46% and 8/26 = 31%,  respectively.  Based  on this data,  we identified  a 
need  to improve  the experience  of pediatric  neuroblastoma  patients  with bone  marrow  
procedures.  Although  there  are no standard  clinical  guidelines,  the AAP recommends  an 
individualized  and age-based  approach  and encourages  the use of both non-pharmacologic  and 
pharmacologic  interventions  that includes  both anesthesia  and analgesia.[ADDRESS_1150488]  of the addition   of  local 
analgesia  is both justified  and necessary.  Local  analgesia  acts to limit the initiation  of 
nociceptive  pathways  prior to the traumatic  insult,  in this case,  subcutaneous  and periosteal  
infiltration  by a bone  marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_828961].  Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828962] a local 
anesthetic  agent  that blocks  both the initiation  and conduction  of nerve  impulses  by [CONTACT_829004] ‟s permeabilit y to sodium  ions.10 It is an amino -amide  local anesthetic  
that is a pure S-(-)-enantiomer  with lower  lipid solubility  than racemic  mixtures;  these  features  
allow  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828963]  a higher  safety  profile  with less cardiovascular  and central  nervous  
system  toxicity  than racemic  lidocaine  and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].10 Its onset  of action  is listed  as “fast”  
with infiltration.  i.e. within  [ADDRESS_1150489] time ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828964].  
 
Primary  and secondary  outcome  measures  were  carefully  selected  after reviewing  
pediatric  pain literature.  Within  pain clinical  trials,  analgesic  efficacy  can be measured  by [CONTACT_829005].  “Rescue  analgesia-sparing” has 
been  identified  as practical  and feasible  surrogate  primary  endpoint  12,13. A systematic  review  of

outcomes.  Relative  differences  in pain scores,  either  over time or with an intervention,  are 
frequently  used  as an outcome  measure  in pain clinical  trials  and will be a secondary  outcome  
in this study.1 2,15 We selected  the Wong -Baker  FACES® Pain Rating  Scale  (WBFPRS)  
(Appendix  1) for this study  because  it is a validated  scale  intended  for use for our patient  
population.14,[ADDRESS_1150491]-procedural  pain 
management  (Appendix  2.1 and 2.2). This algorithm  relies  on the WHO  Analgesic  Ladder  for 
escalation  of therapy.  We referred  to the previously  mentioned  needs  assessment  as well as 
commonly  used  categories  for pain severity  to determine  the interventions  starting  from heat 
packs,  moving  to the non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_237829]:  acetaminophen  and escalating  to a low dose  strong  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_828966] a 4 on the WBFPRS.  
The decision  to use a low dose  strong  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828967] a weak  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828968]-center  study  in 
patients  with cancer  and moderate  pain demonstrating  better  pain relief  with a low dose  strong  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_828969].17 
Groups  such  as the Pediatric  Initiative  on Methods,  Measurement,  and Pain Assessment  
in Clinical  Trials  (PedIMMPACT)  have recommended  multidimensional  outcome  domains  and 
measures  for pediatric  pain clinical  trials.15,[ADDRESS_1150492] consensus  guidelines  for 
investigators  conducting  clinical  trials addressing  acute  pain include  6 domains  including  pain 
intensity,  physical  recovery  and emotional  response.18 We aim to incorporate  these  additional  
domains  into this study  by [CONTACT_14662]  a quality  of life metric  adapted  from a validated  pain 
interference  inventory.  We will use an abbreviated  version  of the National  Institutes  of Health  
(NIH)  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information  System  (PROMIS®) Parent  Proxy  
measure  for pain interference.19,[ADDRESS_1150493]  selected  4 of the 13 items  from the item bank to assess  how 
procedural  pain affects  physical  recovery  in the context  of activity  and sleep  as well as social  
and emotional  functioning  (Appendix  3). 
 
This study  is  clinically   relevant  in the care of pediatric  neuroblastoma  patients  who 
undergo  repeated  painful  procedures  in an effort  to optimize  pain alleviation  and reduce  the 
potential  for  distress   related  to procedures.  We specifically  selected  pediatric   neuroblastoma

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This study  will be a prospective  double -arm randomized  controlled  single -blinded  crossover  
design.  The two interventions  are: 
 
• Intervention  A: MSKCC  standard  of care 
• Intervention  B: MSKCC  standard  of care plus local analgesia  with ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
 
Pediatric  neuroblastoma  patients  will be enrolled  based  on eligibility  criteria  and randomized  to 
one of two arms  representing  a specific  sequence  of each  intervention.  
 
• Arm 1 (AB):  standard  of care only during  the first procedure,  then standard  of care plus 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828970].  
• Arm 2 (BA):  Standard  of care plus ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828971],  then standard  
of care only during  the second  procedure.  
 
Each patient  will serve  as his or her own control.  The patients  and parents  will be blinded  to the 
study  arm. The procedural  attending  physicians  and pharmacy  will have  to coordinate  and 
administer  the treatment  agent  (ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]),  and they will not be blinded  to the study  arm. The 
registered  nurse  (RN) in the procedure  room   will similarly  not be blinded  to the study.  The 
Pediatric  Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (PDH)  Procedure  Recovery  Room  (PRR)  RNs will be blinded  as they will 
also be responsible  for data collection  as described  below.  The study  investigators  who will be 
responsible  for post-procedural  data collection  will similarly  be blinded  to the study  combination.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Intervention  A: The standard  of care agent  will be administered  intravenously  by [CONTACT_829006].  An empty  decoy  syringe  will be provided  by 
[CONTACT_829007].  The empty  
syringe  will be clearly  marked  and discarded.  
 
Intervention  B: The standard  of care agent  will be administered  intravenously  by [CONTACT_829006].  Once  the anesthetic  effect  is achieved  as 
determined  by [CONTACT_101034],  the proceduralist  physician  will inject  subcutaneous  and 
periosteal  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828972] (bilateral  anterior  
and posterior  iliac crests).  Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828973]  8 of 23 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1150495]  dosing  of 2mg/kg  of a 0.5%  solution  (5mg/ml)  and delivered  to the 
procedure  room  by [CONTACT_829008].  
 
The following  process  occurs  after every  procedure.  Patients  will complete  the procedure  and 
recover  in the PRR  for an approximate  time of [ADDRESS_1150496]  pain 
management  algorithm  (Appendix  2.2). After recovery  in the PRR,  patients  will be discharge  
home.  Parents/parent s will assess  their child‟s pain on a validated  self-report  pain scale  and 
administer  pain medication  when  necessary  based  on a standard  pain management  algorithm  
(Appendix  2.2). 
 
5.0     THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
5.1 Study agent: ROPI[INVESTIGATOR_306327]11,  25-28 
 
5.1.1  Source  and Pharmacology:  A local anesthetic.  Mechanism  of action  is by 
[CONTACT_829009]'s  permeability  to sodium  ions, which  results  in inhibition  of 
depolarization  with resultant  blockade  of conduction.  The half-life is 5 to 7 hours  when  
used  as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_828974] a terminal  half-life of 111 ± 62 minutes.  It is 
metabolized  by [CONTACT_829010].  
5.1.2  Formulation  and Stability : Supplied  in single -dose  containers  in 2 mg/ml  (0.2%),  
5 mg/ml  (0.5%),  7.5 mg/ml  (0.75%)  and 10 mg/ml  (1%).  Store  at 20°C  to 25°C.  
In this study,  the PDH  pharmacy  will prepare  four (4) syringes  from a single  vial of the 
5mg/ml  (0.5%)  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828975] a dose  of 2mg/kg/patient  divided  evenly  into 
0.5mg/kg/syringe  with a maximum  dose  of a single  20 ml vial = 100 mg. 
5.1.3  Guidelines for Administration: Doses are administered via local infiltration.

Assistant  (POA)  will circulate  an email  to the consenting  investigators  on this study  that includes  
the name  [CONTACT_829027]  a bone  marrow  
procedure  in the following  week.  Every   day, the consenting  investigators  on this study   are 
included  on an email  notice  of new patients  being  seen  by [CONTACT_829012].  
In this way, potential  study  participants  will be identified  for recruitment.  The consenting  
professional  will be responsible  for explaining  the study  and obtaining  written  informed  consent.  
Participants  in the study  will receive  neither  financial  payment  nor  reimbursement.   Eligible  
patients  of all genders  and racial  groups  will be equally  offered  enrollment  in the study.  
8.0     PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
Before  each  bone  marrow  procedure,  the patient  will be re-evaluated  for continued  eligibility.  If 
the patient  does  not meet  eligibility  at the time of the scheduled  bone  marrow  procedure,  the 
intervention  may be postponed  until a subsequent  bone  marrow  procedure  when  the patient  
meets  eligibility  criteria.  
 
9.0     TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
Each  enrolled  patient  will serve  as his/her  own control.  On two  bone   marrow   procedures,  
patients  will receive  either  intervention  A or B. 
Each  procedure  will occur  at approximately  a two to four month  interval.  The timing  of bone  
marrow  procedures  will be determined  by [CONTACT_102]'s  clinical  course.  
In Intervention  A, standard  of care dosing  and administration  will be at the discretion  of the 
anesthesiologist  according  to standard  of care in the Department  of Anesthesia  at Memorial  
Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center.  In Intervention  B, 2mg/kg  of 0.5%  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828978]  10 of 23 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

pre-filled syringes  with a maximum  dose  of 20ml  = 100mg.  The physician  performing  bone  
marrow  procedures  will administer  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
 
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828979]  [ADDRESS_1150500]  
physicians  will be advised  to administer  one full syringe  volume  for each  site (0.5mg/kg)  with 
equal  distribution  between  the subcutaneous  and periosteal  injection  per site. Currently,  
propofol  alone  is the standard  of care in the Department  of Pediatrics   at  Memorial   Sloan  
Kettering  Cancer  Center.  While  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_777732] a well described  local anesthetic  agent,   the 
addition  of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828980].  
 
10.0   EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Pain will be assessed  in the post-anesthesia  care unit (PRR).  Directly  upon  emergence  from 
anesthesia  after the procedure  and every  15 minutes  subsequently,  PRR  nurses  will use the 
Wong -Baker  FACES® Pain Rating  Scale  (Appendix  1). Nurses  will record  patient -reported  pain 
scores  and administered  analgesia  in the Electronic  Medical  Record  (EMR).  Analgesia  doses  
will be recorded  at the time of administration.  The PRR  nurses  will follow  a standardized  post- 
procedural  algorithm  (Appendix  2.1). Patients  will recover  in the PRR  for approximately  30 to 90 
minutes  prior to discharge  from MSKCC.  In some  instances,  patients  will be discharged  from the 
PRR  to the Neuroblastoma  Clinic  in the Pediatric  Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (PDH).  We anticipate  that all 
patients  will be discharged  from MSKCC  before  6 hours  from the end of their procedure.  In the 
unexpected  case  that a patient  is admitted  to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_828981]  
([ADDRESS_1150501]-procedure),  study  investigators  will provide  the inpatient  RN with the post- 
procedural  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828982]  (Appendix  2.1). Only if the admission  is due to a study  
related  life-threatening  grade  4 toxicity,  will the admitted  patient  be removed  from the study  as 
described  in Section  13.0.  
Families  will be provided  a 2 part, 12 item written  questionnaire  with 4 items  and 8 items  in each  
part, respectively  (Appendix  3). They  will be asked  to complete  Part 1 at 6 hours  (+/- 1 hour)  
and Part 2 at 24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  following  the procedure.  This questionnaire  will have items  
regarding  pain intensity  and management  to be answered  at both time points.  Families  will be 
asked  to follow  a post-procedure  pain management  plan (Appendix  2.2). Post-procedural  quality  
of life (QOL)  will be assessed  using  a four-item questionnaire  (Appendix  3) adapted  from the 
NIH PROMIS® Parent  Proxy  Item Bank  for Pain Interference  and approved  for use by [CONTACT_829013].  These  four questions  will include   the 
domains  of physical  recovery,  emotional  and social  functioning.  QOL will be assessed  about  24 
hours  (+/- 4 hours)  following  the procedure.  Principal  Investigators,   Co-Investigators,  
Investigators  or appropriate  clinic  staff will call families  24-72  hours   following   procedure   to 
obtain  answers  to the questionnaire.

12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
12.1 To assess  primary  objective,  we will determine  and compare  for each  study  intervention  
the percentage  of patients  who required  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828983] 24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  after the procedure.  
12.2 For the secondary  objectives:  
 
a) We will determine  and compare  for each  study  intervention  the percentage  of patients  who 
used  any non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_828958]  24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  after bone  marrow  procedure.  
b) We will calculate  and compare  for each  study  intervention  the total dose  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_828984]  24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  of the bone  marrow  procedure  using  mg/kg/day  
morphine  equivalent.

c) We will also determine  the time to the first opi[INVESTIGATOR_69274].  The starting  point for this 
time will be the time of transfer  to the PRR  which  will be documented  by [CONTACT_829014]. This time 
will be recorded  on the parent  worksheet  by [CONTACT_829014]. 
d) We will assess  standardized  pain scores  at 3 time points:  (1) the maximum  recorded  pain 
score  in the PRR,  (2) at 6 hours  (+/-1 hour)  and (3) 24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  after the bone  marrow  
procedure.  Pain scores  2 and 3 will be recorded  by [CONTACT_829015].  We 
will use the following  validated  pain scales:  Wong -Baker  FACES®  Pain Rating   Scale   for 
patients  between  3-[ADDRESS_1150502]-anesthesia  recovery  unit. We 
will compare  pain scores  between  study  interventions.  
 
e) The QOL  metric  is a brief instrument  that will assess  post-procedural  quality  of life within  24 
hours  (+/- 4 hours)  of the bone  marrow  procedure.  This instrument  assesses  the following  
domains:  sleep,  physical  functioning,  emotional  functioning  and social  functioning.  This brief 
measurement  tool will be adapted  from a validated  metric  for pain interference  in pediatric  
patients:  NIH PROMIS® Parent  Proxy  Item Bank  v1.0 – Pain Interference,  which  is a 13-item 
questionnaire.  However,  given  that our study  has rapid,  frequent  assessments,  we will use an

abbreviated  version  for feasibility  purposes  and to minimize  participant  burden.  Parents  will be 
asked  to assess  QOL at 24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  following  the procedure  by [CONTACT_829016].  Principal  Investigators  or Research  Staff will call families  24-72 hours  
following  procedure  to obtain  answers  to survey.  This phone  call will be for the purposes  of data 
collection  only and not for survey  administration.  
f) Patients  will be under  medical  observation  during  the expected  time when  most  adverse

13.0   CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
a) A patient  will come  off study  if the patient/parent  administers  an opi[INVESTIGATOR_828987]  
24 (+4 hours)  after the bone  marrow  procedure  that is not in accordance  to the algorithm  
provided  to them.  
 
b) If at any time the patient  develops  life-threatening  grade  4 toxicity  during  the study  period,  
he/she  will be removed  from study.  
 
c) If a patient  is found  to be ineligible  for two sequential  bone  marrow  procedures  as designated  
in Section  6, the patient  will be removed  from study.  
 
d) The patient  may withdraw  from study  at any time if the patient/parent  desires.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_1150503]  of care (Intervention  
A) or standard  of care plus ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (Intervention  B, see Section  4.1). Patients  will be 
randomized  to either  Arm 1 (AB sequence)  or Arm 2 (BA  sequence,  see Figure  in Section  1) to 
determine  whether  standard  of care or standard  of care plus ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828988].  Patients  will cross  over during  the second  procedure.  Sample  size 
calculation  is based  on the primary  outcome:  the proportion  of patients  requiring  post-procedural  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_828953]  (“rescue  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]”)  within  24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  post procedure.  A needs  
assessment  conducted  in pediatric  patients  at MSKCC  suggests  that this proportion  is about  
30% under  Intervention  A (standard  of care).  We plan to enroll  50 patients  (total  of 100 
procedures).  
 
This is a crossover  study  in which  we assume  that there  will be no period  effect  (i.e., if 
patient ‟s response  in the subsequent  procedure  is affected  by [CONTACT_829017]).  
Due to the estimated  two month  interval  between  the two procedures  and the duration  of action  
of less than [ADDRESS_1150504].  The primary  
outcome  (whether  the patient  received  rescue  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438])  will be evaluated  with GEE (generalized  
estimating  equations)  for binary  data with logit link function  clustered  by [CONTACT_1962]  23. The model  
Page  14 of 23 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -1417 A(3)  
Approval date: 30 -Jan-2018   
  
 
will include  the drug indicator,  procedure  order,  and an exchangeable  correlation  structure  to 
address  the correlation  between  multiple  observations  from the same  patient.  GEE has the 
advantage  of being  able to include  data from only one of a patient ‟s two procedures,  in order  to 
accommodate  the (rare)  case  in which  the patient  drops  out / withdraws  prior to the second  
procedure.  With complete  data,  however,  this approach  simplifies  to a McNema r‟s test. The 
power  and sample  size calculations  will be based  on McNema r‟s test. 
 
There  is limited  publication  on the correlation  among  longitudinal  measures  of pediatric  
pain scores,  particularly  those  reported  by [CONTACT_829018];  one study  reported  
correlation  of 0.63 between  times  1 and 2 (6 months  apart)  of parent -proxy  reported  pain 
scores24. Assuming  a conservative  correlation  of 0.4 between  the two outcomes  (from  two 
procedures)  of the same  patient,  a sample  size of 45 patients  will allow  80% power  to detect  an 
absolute  difference  of 20% in proportions  between  the treatments  at an alpha  level of 0.05 
(assuming  rates  of 30% in Intervention  A and 10% in Intervention  B). This sample  size allows  
for an interim  assessment  of futility  at the half way point (23 out of 45 patients  with both 
procedures  completed).  If p>0.703,  then the trial will stop for futility;  if p≤0.703  then the study  
will continue  until completion.  The target  enrollment  of 50 patients  allows  for an anticipated  
drop-out rate (due to any reason)  of 10% in the power  analysis  calculation.  This power  
calculation  was generated  using  the proc power  procedure  in SAS 9.4, specifying  paired  
proportions  and correlation  for McNemar exact  conditional  test. Based  on an accrual  rate of 15 
patients  in month  1, 10 patients  in months  2 and 3 and  5 patients  per month  in months  4, 5, and 
6, we anticipate  completion  of enrollment  in 6 months.  
 
The potential  variability  between  attending  physicians  performing  the procedure  will be 
explored  by [CONTACT_829019].  Other  potential  factors  to include  in the GEE models  as fixed effects  may include  total 
number  of biopsies  and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_828989]/or  different  dose  of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
 
Secondary  outcome  of standardized  cumulative  opi[INVESTIGATOR_828990]  24 hours  (+/- 
4 hours)  (morphine  equivalents,  mg/kg/day)  will be summarized  and compared  between  the two 
drugs  using  linear  GEE models  with the same factors  as described  above,  including  of the other  
potential  factors  identified  from the analysis  of the primary  outcome.  Additionally,  time to first 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_828991] 24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  post procedure  will be estimated  using  the 
Kaplan-Meier method and compared between the two drugs using the clustered logrank test. 
This is appropriate  as patients  may never  require  any opi[INVESTIGATOR_828992] 24- 
hours.  The proportion  of patients  requiring  non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_828958]  24 hours  (+/- 4 hours)  of 
procedure  will be compared  between  the two drugs  using  GEE (for binary  data)  as described  for 
the primary  outcome.  
 
Post-operative  pain reported  on the Wong -Baker  FACES®  Pain Rating  Scale  (converted  
to scale  of 0-10) will be measured  at 3 time points:  in the PRR,  at 6 hours  (+/- 1 hour)  and 24 
hours  (+/- 4 hours)  after the procedure.  If more  than one pain score  is recorded  during  the PRR,  
Page  15 of 23 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -1417 A(3)  
Approval date: 30 -Jan-2018   
  
 
then the maximum  pain score  during  the PRR  will be included  in analyses.  Pain scores  will be 
compared  between  the two drugs  using  a linear  GEE model  with drug indicator,  procedure  order  
and the exchangeable  correlation  structure  for the 3 time points.  The GEE models  appropriately  
account  for correlation  among  within -individual  repeated  measures,  sequence  of drugs,  and 
allow  for missingness  (i.e., if the respondent  does  not provide  complete  follow -up data).  Short - 
term QOL and activity  level will be reported  based  on the (NIH PROMIS®  Parent  Proxy  Item 
Bank  v1.0 – Pain Interference)  as individual  items.  QOL  measures  will only be recorded  once  at 
24-hours  post-procedure.  We will use a linear  GEE model  to analyze  the differences  in QOL  
item-measures  between  the two drugs.  Drug  indicator  and procedure  order  will be included  as 
covariates.  Overall  rate of any complications  or major  adverse  events  and the rates  of specific  
adverse  outcomes  related  to the addition  of local ropi[INVESTIGATOR_828993] (for binary  data)  These  analyses  are exploratory  because  they are of 
secondary  interest  and we do not have  prior data to estimate  statistical  power.

monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the 
attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_829024].  
16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_696122]  2001.  The plans   address   the new 
policies set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy of the National  Cancer  Institute  for 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  of  Clinical   Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html .  The  DSM  Plans   at  MSKCC   were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans   can be  found  on the  MSKCC   Intranet  at:  
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/clinresearch/ Pages/protocol -review -committees/data -and-  safety -
monitoring -committee.aspx . 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials 
programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II 
clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  
report  to the Center ‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level 
of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the 
monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
Institutional  monitoring  plan for phase  I and phase  II trials:  Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  
Center  (MSKCC)  has established  standard  procedures  for data safety  monitoring  of clinical  
research.  For Phase  II trials,  these  procedures  include  consideration  of accrual  rates,  toxicity,  
adherence  to dose -escalation  schedules,  adverse  event  notification  and data recording.  
Therapeutic  responses  are logged  on a central  database  and approximately  50% are reviewed  
by [CONTACT_86493].  An annual  report  of the trial‟s progress  is sent to the IRB. All of 
the procedures  for Phase  II studies  outlined  in MSKCC ‟s policy  are applicable  to the current  trial 
and will be followed  by [CONTACT_473].  The analysis  of safety  will include  all patients  who 
receive  at least one dose  of study  medication.  Adverse  events,  including  all toxic effects  of 
treatment,  will be tabulated  individually,  and summarized  by [CONTACT_6764],  according  to study  
medication,  and according  to severity  or toxicity  grade.  Laboratory  data will be tabulated  and 
summarized  by [CONTACT_271296],  as well as on the basis  of MSKCC  specified  normal  range.

17.0   PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
Patient  participation  in this protocol  is completely  voluntary.  Patients  will be provided  with 
documentation  explaining  the protocol  rationale  and objectives,  as well as its potential  risks,  
benefits,  toxicities/side  effects,  inconveniences  and financial  costs/burdens.  Alternative  options  
for therapy  will also be discussed.  Patients  who choose  to participate  will sign an informed  
consent  conforming  to the MSKCC  IRB guidelines.  The protocol  will protect  the rights  and 
privacy  of all participants.  Children,  adolescents  and young  adults  are eligible  for this study.  
Patients  of both sexes  and all ethnic/racial  backgrounds   are eligible  for this study.  Alternative  
treatments  are available  and will be discussed  with the patients  and/or  legal guardian.  
 
It is not known  whether  this treatment  will improve  the overall  survival   of  the  patient.   The 
potential  risks of this therapy  are described  in Section  11 of this protocol  and may outweigh  the 
potential  benefits  in an individual  patient.  Reporting  of serious  adverse   events   is  found   in 
section  17.2.  
 
Costs:  Patients  are responsible  for the costs  of physician  visits  and usual  laboratory  tests,  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  radiographic  studies,  drug administration  and outpatient  care.  If there  is an 
injury  as a result  of the research  study,  emergency  care,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  and outpatient  care will 
be made  available  by [CONTACT_464980][INVESTIGATOR_828996].  No money  will be provided  by [CONTACT_464980][INVESTIGATOR_828997] - 
related  injury.   Patients  will not be paid for taking  part in this study.  
17.1 Privacy  
 
It is the responsibility  of the Research  Staff to ensure  that protocol  subjects   received   the 
Cente r‟s Notice  of Privacy  Practices.  If the subject  has not received  one, MSK personnel  must  
provide  a Notice  of Privacy  Practices  and obtain  acknowledgment  before  the subject  
participates  in the study.  
 
MSK‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  pursuant  
to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of protected  
health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  
A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_56909]  (IRB/PB).  
 
17.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28612]  19 of 23 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 16 -1417 A(3)  
Approval date: 30 -Jan-2018   
  
 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  
judgment,  they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is  not considered  
an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  
Any events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to 
protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of 
Serious  Adverse  Events ‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days 
of the event.  The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be 
submitted  electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] . All other  
reports should be sent to [EMAIL_203]. 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
• Subject ‟s initials  
• Medical  record  number  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data needing  to be entered:  
• The date the adverse  event  occurred  
• The adverse  event  
• The grade  of the event  
• Relationship  of the adverse  event  to the treatment  (drug,  device,  or intervention)  
• If the AE was expected  
• The severity  of the AE

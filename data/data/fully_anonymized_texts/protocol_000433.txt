Planned Analyses for:  
Novelty, Conformity and Trust in Vaccines  
 
March [ADDRESS_332829]:  
 
A3. How much do you think the government should subsidize the conventional  COVID -19 vaccine? 
[100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0%]  
 
A4. If the conventional COVID -19 vaccine were provided to you for free, how likely are you to 
accept the vaccination? [Likert scale 1 = Very unlikely, 5 = Very likely]  
 
A5. Suppose the conventional COVID -19 vaccine is endorsed by [CONTACT_272349], free, but no 
one in your country has received the vaccine.   How likely would you be willing to be vaccinated 
with this new vaccine?  [Likert scale  1 = Very unlikely, 5 = Very likely]  
 
A6. Suppose the conventional/RNA COVID -19 vaccine is endorsed by [CONTACT_272349], free, but 
no one  in your country has received the vaccine.   How likely would you recommend your loved 
ones to be vaccinated with this ne w vaccine?  [Likert scale 1 = Very unlikely, 5 = Very likely]  
 
Note: This is a 2x5 between -subjects design. The two varying dimensions are vaccine technology 
(conventional vs. RNA) and adoption rate in the country (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%).  
 
For questions A4 -A6, the primary outcome variable of interest is the proportion of people who 
respond, “Very likely”. Secondary outcome variables of interest are the proportion of people who 
respond either “Very likely” or “Somewhat likely”; those who respond either “Some what unlikely” 
or “Very unlikely”; and those who respond “Very unlikely”.  
 
We plan to examine the differences in outcome variables across countries ([LOCATION_003], Brazil, Mexico, 
China, India, Indonesia, Russia, [LOCATION_013], and the [LOCATION_006]).  We will conduct two -sample  proportion 
test to test if the difference  in proportions  between  two countries are statistically significant.  We 
will conduct Kolmogorov -Smirnov test  to test if the distributions of responses between two 
countries are statistica lly significant.  
 
We will plot the average responses to the above questions in two ways. First, we will plot simple 
bar charts, where the nine countries are displayed on the x-axis, and the outcome variables  on the 
y-axis, along with  95% confidence interval s. Second, we will draw a heatmap of the globe, with 
colors corresponding to the average responses from each country (higher color intensity 
corresponds to higher willingness to receive vaccine).  
 
Finally, we will normalize the aver age responses to the four COVID -19 questions above by [CONTACT_272350]’s attitude towards vaccines in general. We will create an index of country’s general 
attitude towards vaccines by [CONTACT_272351]:  
 
A1. Do you agree, disagree, or neither agree nor disagree with the following statement? (If agree) 
Do you strongly or somewhat agree? (If disagree) Do you strongly or somewhat disagree?  
 
A1-1. Vaccines are important for children to have. [Likert scale 1 = Str ongly disagree, 5 = 
Strongly agree]  
 
A1-2. Vaccines are safe.  [Likert scale 1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree]  
 
A1-3. Vaccines are effective.  [Likert scale 1 = Strongly disagree, 5 = Strongly agree]  
 
The index will range from 1 to 5. The normalizat ion will be done by [CONTACT_272352] A3 (A4, A5, A6) by [CONTACT_272353].  
 
We will conduct two -sample t-test to test if the differences in normalized measures of trust in 
COVID -19 vaccines across countries are statistically significant. We will plot the normalized 
measures using bar charts and heatmaps.  
 
2. Comparison of attitudes towards conventional vs. RNA vaccines  for COVID -19 
 
50% of survey subjects will be asked about their attitudes towards conventional  COVID -19 
vaccines (questions A3 – A6), and the other 50% will be asked about their attitudes towards RNA  
COVID -[ADDRESS_332830] in COVID -19 vaccines and the adoption rate in the country  
 
We will examine if the willingness to receive new COVI D-19 vaccine (question A6) is  affected 
by [CONTACT_272354]. We will plot a graph, where the adoption 
rates are displayed on the x-axis, and the willingness to receive the new vaccine on the y-axis. 
There will be two lines : the first line will show the plot for conventional vaccines, and the second 
line for RNA vaccines.  
 
We will estimate regression models to test if the slope is positive (i.e., the willingness to receive 
the vaccine increases with the adoption rate in the country); whether the slope for RNA vaccine is 
steeper than that for conventional vaccines; and to identify points at which the slope is steepest.

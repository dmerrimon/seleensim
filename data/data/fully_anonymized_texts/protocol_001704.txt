General Information  
Our study aims to determine the therapeutic response of patients with non -allergic rhinitis with local IgE 
elevation to intranasal capsaicin, the prevalence of non -allergic rhinitis with local IgE elevation in the 
non-allergic rhinitis population, and to determine the change in intranasal IgE after capsaicin treatment.  
 
Background Information 
Rhinitis is inflammation of the nasal lining characterized by 2 or more of the following nasal symptoms: congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing or itching. Chronic rhinitis is categorized as allergic or non -allergic 
rhinitis.  Allergic rhinitis is driven by [CONTACT_321501] -mediated response to allergens in the environment. Non - 
allergic rhinitis represents a heterogenous group of disorders whose underlying pathology is not IgE - 
mediated. Allergy testing distinguishes between allergic an d non -allergic rhinitis. Subtypes of non - 
allergic rhinitis include drug -induced, hormonal, atrophic, gustatory, non -allergic rhinitis with 
eosinophilia syndrome (NARES), and non -allergic rhinitis with local IgE elevation. This heterogenous 
group can be di vided into conditions that demonstrate nasal inflammation histologically (NARES and 
non-allergic rhinitis with local IgE elevation) and those that do not. Those that do not are often referred 
to as non -allergic rhinopathy rather than rhinitis due to the lack of inflammation. Allergic rhinitis is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_321493] a combination of nasal steroids, nasal antihistamines, oral steroids, and oral antihistamines. Non -allergic rhinitis demonstrating inflammation (NARES and non -allergic rhinitis with 
local IgE elevation) may best be treated similarly. However, non -allergic rhinopathy tends to be driven 
by [CONTACT_321502]. Therefore, ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_321494] -allergic rhinopathy. When medical therapy is insufficient, interventions focusing 
on the ablation of the parasympathetic innervations of the nasal mucosa are options including vidian neurectomy or cryotherapy of the nerve.  
 
A thorough history and physical can sometimes identify a specific subtype of non -allergic rhinitis to 
guide therapy. However, certain conditions, such as non -allergic rhinitis with local IgE elevation, cannot 
be confirmed without further evaluation. Two te chniques have recently been proposed to differentiate 
inflammatory and non -inflammatory subtypes of non -allergic rhinitis: detection of local IgE levels from  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0333 
IRB APPR OPVaAgLe D3 AofT7E: 05/25/[ADDRESS_396782] demonstrated that patients with elevated local IgE levels may 
respond similarly to oral antihistamines and topi[INVESTIGATOR_321495]. It is this rationale t hat has led some to propose using nasal provocation testing and local IgE levels in the 
diagnostic evaluation of patients with non -allergic rhinitis.

Optical rhinometry is a technique which measures the blood flow in nasal vessels reported as optical 
density (OD). When used with intranasal provocation testing, it is useful in measuring changes in blood 
flow which correlates with onset of symptoms and increase in nasal mucosal swelling. [ADDRESS_396783] higher baseline levels of transient receptor potential villanoid 1 (TRPV1) within the nasal mucosa 
[ADDRESS_396784] recent Cochrane review 
describes capsaicin as an option for patients with idiopathic, non -allergic rhinitis. 
9 We hope to further 
delineate the group of idiopathic non -allergic rhinitis patients that will benefit from intranasal capsaicin 
in an effort to refine the treatment algorithm for non -allergic rhinitis.  
 
Objectives  
− Primary: To de termine the therapeutic response of non -allergic rhinitis patients that have been 
subtyped  as non-allergic  rhinitis  with  local  IgE elevation  or non-allergic  rhinopathy  to intranasal 
capsaicin based on visual analog scale and optical rhinometry  
o The total as well as individual symptom VAS scores at enrollment, [ADDRESS_396785] -treatment will be  compared  
− Secondary: To determine the prevalence of non -allergic rhinitis with local IgE elevation in this 
study’s  cohort  of patients  with  non-allergic  rhinitis  identified  by [CONTACT_321503]: HSC -MS-19-0333 
IRB APPR OPVaAgLe D4 AofT7E: 05/25/[ADDRESS_396786]- treatment will be  compared  
 
Study Design  
− Prospective cohort  study  
− The study is expected to last [ADDRESS_396787] participation lasting 15  weeks.  
− Therapeutic response to intranasal capsaicin will be measured using major nasal symptoms on a 
visual analog scale, as well as optical rhinometry.  
o Nasal symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, nasal itching, and sneezing, will be 
measured using a visual analog score. Results range from [ADDRESS_396788] -treatment data can be compared to measure change in  symptoms.  
o Optical rhinometry: Maximum optical density will be recorded following the initial capsaicin 
challenge, as well as at [ADDRESS_396789] -treatment  
− Assessment of efficacy will be based  on repeat symptoms scores (nasal symptom inventory pre - 
treatment and at [ADDRESS_396790]- treatment). 
Additionally, brush biopsy of the inferior turbinates will be performed pre -treatment and [ADDRESS_396791] -treatment in order to determine any change in local IgE  levels.  
− This study is using previously described methods with good safety profiles. Patients may experience 
minimal pain and some discomfort with the skin prick test for allergy testing, the mucosal swab for IgE levels, and the intranasal capsaicin.  
− Patients will receive skin allergy testing with results and clinic visits with physician at no charge. In 
addition, study drugs will be provided at no cost to the patient. Although no monetary 
compensation  will be provided  for participating  in the study,  study  participants  will be reimbursed 
the fee for parking at all three  visits.

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0333 
IRB APPR OPVaAgLe D5 AofT7E: 05/25/[ADDRESS_396793] visit after enrollment:  
− Rate  major  nasal symptoms  (rhinorrhea,  nasal obstruction,  nasal itching,  and sneezing)  on a visual 
analog  scale  
− Complete skin prick allergy  testing  
− A nasal brushing to determine local IgE  levels  
− Optical rhinometry  with  intranasal capsaicin  challenge  to confirm  diagnosis  of non-allergic  irritant 
rhinitis1 
 
This will be followed by [CONTACT_3148]:  
− Intranasal capsaicin,  [ADDRESS_396794]- treatment (+/ - 1 week)  
− Rate major nasal symptoms on a v isual analog  scale  
− To reduce  visits  during the study,  the VAS at [ADDRESS_396795]- treatment (+/ - 2 weeks)  
− Rate major nasal sym ptoms on a visual analog  scale  
− A nasal brushing will be obtained to determine local IgE  levels  
− Optical rhinometry with intranasal capsaicin  challenge1 
 
Information gathered for the study will include: personal health information, major nasal symptoms, 
allergy skin test results, mucosal IgE levels, and optical rhinometry.  
 
− Any physical information (Consent, VAS, etc.) will be stored in a locked filing cabinet within the 
locked otolaryngology clinic located at [ADDRESS_396796] (Multi -Test II Lincoln Diagnostics, Decatur, IL [LOCATION_003]) to common allergens includin g dust mite, cat 
hair,  grass  pollen,  insect  extracts,  fungi/mold  extracts,  and bermuda  grass  extract  to exclude  allergic 
rhinitis. Those with confirmed negative skin prick testing (ruling out allergic rhinitis) will be eligible 
for the  study.  
o Having a posi tive reaction to at least one antigen and the positive control will be considered 
positive testing, and that subject will be excluded from the study  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-19-0333 
IRB APPR OPVaAgLe D6 AofT7E: 05/25/[ADDRESS_396797] will be eligible for the  study.  
 
Mucosal brush biopsies  
− The mucosal local IgE levels will be obtained according to the protocol demonstrated by [CONTACT_321504].2 
o A cytology brush will be used to brush the inferior turbinates ([ADDRESS_396798] of the inferior turbinates). The brush is then washed in saline and stored 
at -20C.  
o Antigen specific IgE will be determined using reference lab from the processed  sample.  
 
Intranasal capsaicin treatment  
− The intranasal capsaicin treatment will be completed according to the protocol for treatment  of 
non-allergic irritant rhinitis with intranasal capsaicin established by [CONTACT_321505].3 
o Patients will be treated with 5 intranasal doses of capsaicin separated by 1  hour  
o Capsaicin solution (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO [LOCATION_003]) will be diluted in 1% ethanol and 
0.9% normal saline. A mucosal atomizer device (MAdomizer, Wolfe Tory Medical, Inc,  Salt 
Lake City, UT [LOCATION_003]) delivering 100 µL solution will be used to deliver a total dose of 2 µg of capsaicin to each nasal cavity for each application. Each application of capsaicin will be 
preceded by [CONTACT_38658] 100 µL of aerosolized 1% lidocaine for an esthesia 15 minutes 
prior to each planned intranasal capsaicin  application.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
− Serious adverse events are not anticipated. Patients may experience minimal pain and some 
discomfort with the skin prick for allergy testing, the mucosa l brushing for IgE levels, and the 
intranasal capsaicin.  
− The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_321497],  protocol  deviations,  and other 
problems. These will be addressed immediately by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_321498]-investigators.  
− On the first of each mon th, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_321499], to ensure that the study is proceeding strictly according to protocol. The status of the study will be reviewed during a monthly meeting with the rhinologic team which consists of Drs. 
Luong, Martin Citardi and William  Yao.  
 
Statistics  
In considering our sample size calculation, we considered our primary outcome as the change in VAS for 
the major nasal symptom. Using the study by [CONTACT_321506]. to guide a sample size calc ulation, we 
assumed a success rate of capsaicin to be 75% with success defined as a decrease of at least 30% on the 
VAS for the major nasal symptom. In their study, they enrolled 33 patients with non -allergic rhinitis and 
showed a significant response to intranasal capsaicin treatment via VAS. Consequently, we will plan for 
33 patients with non -allergic rhinitis to complete this study.  
 
Differences between all continuous descriptive factors and both pretreatment and posttreatment outcome measure scores, between participants with and without local IgE elevation, will be evaluated using Mann Whitney U or chi -square (χ2) testing where approp riate. Significant improvements in 
outcome measure scores over time and between pretreatment and posttreatment scores will be evaluated using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Significant differences will be identified at a conventional  
0.050 alpha level.

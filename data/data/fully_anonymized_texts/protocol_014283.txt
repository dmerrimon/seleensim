Protocol Title :  A Randomized, Multiple Dose Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of IPX203 in Subject s with Advanced Parkinson’s Disease  
Protocol No.:   IPX20 3-B16-01 
Study center(s):   Multicenter  
Phase of Development:   Phase 2  
Study  Duration :  Approximately 8 weeks including Screening  
Objectives:  
Primary:   To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of single and multiple doses of IPX203 
with immediate release ( IR) CD-LD in subject s with advanced Parkinson’s disease  (PD) . 
Secondary:  
 To compare the pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of IPX203 with 
IR CD-LD 
 To compare the efficacy of IPX203 with IR  CD-LD following multiple doses  
 To evaluate  the safety of IPX203 . 
Methodology:  This is a randomized, open -label, rater -blinded, multicenter,  2-treatment, 
2-period, multiple -dose crossover  study.   Approximately [ADDRESS_354517] of 4 study  visits  after Screening :  Day 1 of each treatment per iod 
(Visits 1 and 3), and Day 15 of each treatment period (Visits 2 and 4) .  Study Exit  procedures  
will be  done at the end of Visit [ADDRESS_354518] 4  weeks prior to Visit 1.   During the 1 -week (±  2 days) washout period between treatment 
periods, subjects will return to their prestudy PD medication regimen.  
Within [ADDRESS_354519] dose of CD -LD no later than 10:[ADDRESS_354520] morning dose of study medication will be administered at the study site.  The “first 
morning dose” is def ined as the subject’s first LD dose upon awakening for the day 
immediately following the subject’s usual nocturnal sleep period intended to achieve an “on”

Amendment 2: October [ADDRESS_354521] experiences an “off” state for 
≥ [ADDRESS_354522] may receive rescue medication, (by [CONTACT_290617] ).  PK blood sampling  and 
pharmacodynamic assessments will be continued throughout the 8 -hour PK/pharmacodynamic 
study period including in those subjects who receive rescue medication.  
Day 1 (Visits 1 and 3) bloo d samples  (6 mL) for PK analysis will be collected predose and at 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, and 8 hours postdose.  
The following pharmacodynamic measures will be conducted during Visits 1 and 3 by 
[CONTACT_290618]:  
 Assessment of Subject’s Motor State (“on” and “off,” and state of dyskinesia) at –1, –0.5, 
0, and at half -hourly intervals postdose for up to 8 hours.  
 MDS -UPDRS Part III (Motor Examination) at predose and hourly for up to 8 hours 
postdose.  
Following the completion of Visits 1 and 3, subjects will be discharged from the clinic and 
instructed to take the ir assigned study drug at home for the remainder of Day 1 through 
Day 14 of each treatment period  and return to the clinic on Day  15 (of each treatment period) 
for Visits  [ADDRESS_354523]’s stable prestudy regimen unless they were taking a single daily bedtime 
dose of CR CD-LD, either  alone or  in combination with IR CD-LD, in which case, the 
CR CD-LD dose  will be discontinued and substituted with a 1:1 milligram -equivalent  
IR CD-LD dose.  A “bedtime dose” is defined as a dose of CR  CD-LD taken within [ADDRESS_354524]’s normal night time sleep period.  During the IPX203 treatment period, the in itial 
doses of IPX203 will be based on the subject’s prestudy stable LD regimen and the initial 
response to IPX203.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_290588]203 will be three times a day, dosed 
approximately every [ADDRESS_354525] (minimize “off” time without causing troublesome dyskinesia or 
other dopaminergic side effects).  
During Days [ADDRESS_354526]’s 
study medication regimen if necessary to optimize  efficacy and safety .  Site staff should 
follow -up on the subject’s status (dosing, response and adverse events) every [ADDRESS_354527] 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.   Subjects will complete their Dosing and PD 
Diaries  and wear the Kinesia  360 sensor bands  on the more affected side at home immediately 
after waking in the morning  on each of the 3 days prior to Visits 2 and 4 (Days 12-14 of each 
treatment period ). 
For the Day 15 clinic visits, the  subjects  will be instructed to withh old their study medication 
Protocol No. IPX203 -B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 2: October [ADDRESS_354528] morning dose and subsequent 
doses administered  in the clinic will be the same as the dosing regimen recorded in the dosing 
diary  for Day s 12-14 of the current treatment period.  
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures will the n be assessed in the clinic for up to 
10 hours postdose during Visits 2 and 4 .  PK blood sampling  and pharmacodynamic 
assessments will be continued throughout the 10 -hour PK/pharmacodynamic study period.  
Day 15 (Visits 2 and 4) blood  samples (6  mL) for PK analysis will be collected predose and at 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 hours postdose.  
The following pharmacodynamic measures will be conducted during Visits 2 and 4 by

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the extrapyramidal 
nervous system.  Levodopa (LD) used in combination with carbidopa (CD) is considered the 
gold standard for the symptomatic treatment of PD.  LD is a dopamine precursor converted to 
dopamine by [CONTACT_89920] (AADC).  Carbidopa is an AADC inhibitor that 
does not cross the blood-brain barrier.  When used in combination with LD, CD increases the 
plasma half-life of LD from 50 minutes to 1.5 hours.  Carbidopa inhibits the conversion of LD 
into dopamine in the periphery, thereby [CONTACT_89921]-effects caused by [CONTACT_89922].  The administration of CD 
with LD reduces the dose of LD required to produce a dopaminergic response by [CONTACT_2902] 
75 percent (Sinemet prescribing information , Appendix A).  
Due to its proven efficacy, LD is prescribed eventually to most subject s with PD.  However, 
long-term use of LD is associated with certain complications , including  “wearing off” or “end -
of-dose effect,” where symptom control decreases resulting in the drug effects to wear off  
sooner .  As the disease progresses further, motor complications, namely dyskinesia s and motor 
“on/off” fluctuations, develop in about 50% of the patients after 5 years of treatment (Fahn 
1999).  Such motor complications can be a significant source of disability and their  management 
is a major unmet need in the treatment of PD. 
Mechanisms underlying motor complications involving dyskinesias and “on/off” fluc tuations in 
PD are unclear.  The pulsatile nature of standard orally administered LD is thought to contribute 
to the appearance of motor complications.  Chronic intermittent pulsatile stimulation of the 
dopamine receptors that are under tonic control contributes to the development of dyskinesia in 
PD animal models as compared to animals treated with continuous infusion ( Juncos 1989 , 
Engber 1989 , Blanchet 1995 ).  In addition, unreliable absorption of LD potentially due to erratic 
gastric empting and variable in vivo dissolution of LD products is thought to contribute to the 
delay or inadequate response after oral dosing with standard CD-LD products ( Melamed 1986, 
Kurlan 1988 , Stocchi 1994 ).  These findings suggest that motor complications in patients with 
PD may be less likely to develop with continuous dopaminergic stimulation. 
Intraduodenal infusion of LD has been shown to significantly reduce motor complications and to 
reduce “off” time.  The findings of infusion studies in PD patients indicate that the maintenance 
of stable plasma LD concentrations and the avoidance of low trough levels are effective in 
reducing “off” hours, increasing “on” hours without disabling dyskinesia, and reducing the 
severity of dyskinesia versus standard oral LD formulations ( Mizuno 2007 , Nilsson 2001 , 
Nyholm 2005 , Stocchi 2005 ).  These findings provide a strong rationale for the development of 
an extended release (ER) oral formulation that delivers a constant LD plasma concentration in 
order to optimize relief of PD symptoms, and to minimize “off” time and dyskinesia.  
IPX203 is an investigational product containing CD-LD that is being developed by [CONTACT_89923], Inc. through its Impax Specialty Pharma division (Impax).  The primary objective 
of the IPX203 program is to develop an extended release product that can attain therapeutic LD 
plasma concentrations rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89912] a longer 
duration than currently approved products with minimal peak to trough fluctuations.  IPX203 is 
designed to be dos ed approximately every 8 hours, three times a day based on the plasma LD

Study IPX203 -B14-[ADDRESS_354550] s with adv anced PD versus IR CD-LD and Rytary.   Twenty -six 
(26) subjects have been randomized .  Preliminary  results are based on data available as of 
August 4, 2016.  At the time of this cutoff,  one subject had discontinued study early due to 
subject withdrawal.  Administration of  IPX203 yielded an initial increase in LD plasma 
concentrations that was similar to both IR and Rytary but maintain ed LD concentrations longer 
than Rytary.   IPX203 provided  a longer duration of effect compared with IR CD-LD and Rytary , 
including “Good On Time”  based on the  Assessment of Subject’s Motor State and on several of 
the MDS -UPDRS -III improvement thresholds .  In this ongoing single dose study , 5 (19.2%, 
5/26) subjects have reported adverse events .  Two subject s (8%, 2/25) reported 3 treatment -
related  AEs after treatment with IPX203  compared with 4 subjects (16.7%, 4/ 24) who reported 
treatment -related AEs after treatment with IR CD-LD.  To date, no subjects in this study have 
reported serious or severe AEs, or have discontinued from the study because of AEs, irrespective 
of treatment.  
Study IPX203 -B16-01 is designed to assess the single - and multiple -dose PK, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of IPX203.

Amendment 2: October 5, [ADDRESS_354551] of 4 study visits after Screening:  Day 1 of each 
treatment period (Visits 1 and 3), and Day 15 of each treatment period (Visits 2 and 4).  Study 
Exit procedures are done at the end of Visit 4 or within 3 days of Visit 4, or during an early 
withdrawal.  Between treatment periods, subjects will return to their prestudy PD medication 
regimen during the 1-week (  2 days) washout period.  Subjects may continue to take allowed 
non-CD-LD based PD medications throughout the study if documented in their prestudy regimen 
and if dosing regimens have been stable for at least [ADDRESS_354552] dose of 
CD-LD no later than 10:[ADDRESS_354553]’s stable prestudy regimen unless they were taking a single daily bedtime dose of 
CR CD -LD, either alone or in combination with IR CD-LD, in which case, the CR CD -LD dose 
will be discontinued and substituted with a 1:1 milligram-equivalent IR CD -LD dose.  A 
“bedtime dose” is defined  as a dose of CR CD -LD taken within [ADDRESS_354554]’s normal 
nighttime sleep period.  During the IPX203 treatment period, subjects are assigned their initial 
IPX203 dosing regimen according to the guidance provided in Table 4 (see Section 6.4.2 ), which 
is based on each individual’s prestudy IR CD-LD morning dose and daily dosing regimen.  The 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_290588]203 will be three times a day, dosed approximately every [ADDRESS_354555] 
(minimize “off” t ime without causing troublesome dyskinesia or other dopaminergic side 
effects).  Nighttime dosing of study medication is allowed as needed with the exception of the 
evening prior to Day 15 (withhold dosing for at least 5 hours before arriving at the site) of each 
treatment period.  Subjects may continue to take allowed non- CD-LD based PD medications 
throughout the study if documented in their prestudy regimen and if dosing regimens have been 
stable for at least [ADDRESS_354556]’s study 
medication regimen if necessary to optimize efficacy and safety. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures are assessed in the clinic for up to 8 hours 
postdose on Day 1 of each treatment period (Visits 1 and 3), and for up to 10 hours on Day 15 of

Page 25 of 136 IR LD Dose Adjustment (Days 1-9):  
 During the IR CD -LD treatment period, the initial dosing regimen of IR CD -LD will be 
the subject’s stable prestudy CD -LD regimen. 
 If the subject’s prestudy regimen included a single daily bedtime dose of CR CD -LD, 
either alone or in combination with IR CD -LD, the CR CD -LD dose will be discontinued 
and substituted with a 1:1 milligram-equivalent IR CD -LD dose.  A “bedtime dose” is 
defined as a dose of CR CD-LD taken within [ADDRESS_354564]’s normal night time 
sleep period.  For example, a 200-mg daily bedtime dose of CR CD -LD will be replaced 
with a 200-mg bedtime dose of IR CD-LD. 
IPX203 Dose Adjustment (Days 1-9):  
Table [ADDRESS_354565] receives in the afternoon and evening and 
administer IPX203 according to Table 4.  
 If the subject takes different prestudy LD doses with equal frequency, determine the 
IPX203 dose based on the highe st LD dose. 
 When determining the most frequent prestudy LD dose for subsequent IPX203 doses, 
consider all prestudy LD doses taken from noon to bedtime.  If the subject takes a 
bedtime CR CD-LD dose and the subject also takes a dose of IR CD-LD within one hour 
of the bedtime dose of CR CD-LD, then add the CR and IR LD doses together.

 The IPX203 dosing regimen may be adjusted as needed based on the subject ’s response 
to the previous day’s dosing.  Doses of IPX203 may be adjusted in increments of 90 mg 
to achieve adequate therapeutic effects.  The 90 mg adjustments can be achieved by 
[CONTACT_290624] 180 mg and 270 mg capsules.  For example, a 360 mg dose 
(180 mg ×  2 capsules ) can be increased by 90 mg (to 450 mg) by [CONTACT_17801] a 270 m g 
capsule and a 180 mg capsule. 
 If a subject experiences bothersome peak-related or levodopa- related side effects, the 
doses of IPX203 may be reduced in steps of 90 mg. 
 If a subject experiences end-of- dose “off” epi[INVESTIGATOR_290594] “off” periods occur during the day ,  
o the IPX203 dose may be increased (if the subject does not experience troublesome 
dyskinesia), or 
o the time between two doses may be decreased, or 
o the dosing frequency may be increased to achieve an adequate therapeutic effect. 
 IPX203 should not require dosing more than four times a day.  For subjects who require 
an adjustment from three times a day to a four times a day dosing of IPX203, each 
individual dose may need to be reduced by 90-180 mg depending on response. 
Dosing of Study Medication on Days 10 – [ADDRESS_354566] ’s IR CD-LD and IPX203 dosing regimen may be

Page 48 of 136 13. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
13.1. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_89944]:  
 ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, physical exam inations , the C -SSRS, and vital signs.  
 Adverse events and concomitant medications will  be evaluated over the course of the 
study.  
13.2. Adverse Events  
13.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (adverse experience) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not neces sarily have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, wheth er or not considered rel ated to 
the medicinal product.  
All AEs and any clinically significant physical examination findings, 12 -lead ECG 
abnormalities, or clinical laboratory measurements occurring during the study that were not 
present prior to administra tion of study medication and that continue at Study Exit should be 
followed and evaluated with additional tests, if necessary, until the AEs are medically stable or 
resolved.  Follow -up on these AEs should be recorded on the source documents and reported t o 
Impax.  
13.2.2.  Recording Adverse Events  
Elicit information about AEs with nonselective questions such as:  “Have you experienced any 
changes in your health status since your last visit?”  Encourage subjects to report AEs at onset.  
Record information for any AE t hat emerges from the time the subject signs the ICF until Study 
Exit.  
Monitor each subject closely for the development of AEs and record all such events on the AE 
page of the CRF.  Whenever possible, group signs and symptoms that constitute a single 
diagno sis.  For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be grouped as upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977].  
For each AE, record the onset date, severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication, date 
of resolution (or continuing), action taken, and outcome in the CRF.  The Investigator is to make 
a causality assessment (relationship to study medication) for every AE.  
13.2.3.  Follow -up 
The Investigator must follow each AE until resolved or medically stable.

Amendment 2: October 5 , 2016  Impax Laboratories, Inc.  
Page 49 of 136 13.2.4.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator documents his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_89917]:  
 Not Related —the experience can be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s underlying 
medical condition or concomitant medications and no relationship exists between the 
study medication a nd the experience.  
 Unlikely Related —the temporal relationship between the AE and the administration 
of the study medication is uncertain and it is likely that the AE can be explained by 
[CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Possibly Related —there is some logical temporal relationship between the AE and 
the administration of the study medication and the experience is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Related —the temporal relationship is compelling b etween the administration of the 
study medication and the AE cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition 
or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
13.2.5.  Assessment of Severity  
Grade each AE for severity and note in the description of the AE.  Determine the severity 
categor y of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined below, and enter the information on the AE 
page of the CRF.  
 Mild —causing no limitation of usual activities  
 Moderate —causing some limitation of usual activities  
 Severe —causing inability to carry out usual activitie s 
13.3. Serious Adverse Events  
13.3.1.  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes, regardless of relationship to the study medication:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse d rug experience  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Protocol No. IPX203-B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL 
Amendment 2: October 5, [ADDRESS_354615] be reported by [CONTACT_89945]’s representative within 24 hours of knowledge of the even t (see  Study Contact 
[CONTACT_7171] ). 
An SAE form must be completed and sent to the Sponsor and/or the Sponsor’s representative.  
All SAEs must also be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  Additionally, all SAEs must be 
reported to the institutional review board (IRB) per the IRB’s requirements.  
Those SAEs that are considered both serious and unexpected and related to the study drug are 
subject to expedited reporting.  An “unexpected AE” is any AE where the nature or s everity is 
not consistent with the current investigator brochure (IB) or if an IB is not required or available, 
the specificity or severity is not consistent with the provided risk information. 
Unexpected fatal or life-threatening SAEs related to the study drug must be reported by [CONTACT_89946] (ie, first report within 
[ADDRESS_354616] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]).  The Sponsor will provide a final written report to that 
authority within 15 days of initial receipt of information on the event.  The Sponsor or the 
Sponsor’s representative will also inform all participating Investigators of the SAE.  
Unexpected SAEs that are not fatal or life-threatening must be reported by [CONTACT_290631] [ADDRESS_354617] 
knowledge of the SAE by [CONTACT_1034].  The Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative also 
informs all participating Investigators of the SAE. 
Subjects withdrawn from the study due to any SAE will be followed until the SAE is resolved or 
medically stable.  Record all SAEs, regardless of severity and whether or not related to the study 
medication, on the appropriate page of the CRF. 
The Investigator must determine whether the seriousness of the event warrants removal of the 
subject from the study.  He/she should, in any case, institute appropriate diagnostic and 
therapeutic measures and keep the subject under observation for as long as is medically 
indicated, or refer the subject to appropriate health professionals. 
13.4. Pregnancy 
Any pregnancy that occurs from the time the subject signs an ICF until [ADDRESS_354618] be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s 
representative and the subject should be terminated from the study.  All pregnancies will be 
followed through to delivery of the infant.  If the subject experiences a termination of the 
pregnancy, it should be reported as defined in Section 13.3.2 . 
13.5. Other Safety Parameters and Related Information 
Additional safety parameters (laboratory tests, 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations, and vital 
signs), the C-SSRS, and concomitant medications are collected as shown in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Table 5 and evaluated over the course of the study.  Clinical laboratory studies 
are listed in Appendix J .

Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_290633] -LD and IPX203.  Following natural logarithm transformation, analyses of variance 
(ANOVA) will be performed on CD and LD AUC and C max adjusted for dose, fluctuation, and 
accumulation .  Additionally, duration of LD plasma concentration above 50% of C max values will 
be analyzed using ANOVA.  Comparisons will be performed using a mixed-effect ANOVA 
model that includes treatment, period, and sequence as fixed effects and subject-within-sequence 
as a random effect for the following treatments: IPX203 versus IR CD-LD.  All PK analyses will 
be done following current recommendations ( Food and Drug Administration 2003 ). 
14.4. Analysis of Efficacy Data 
Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be displayed for all endpoints. 
14.4.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy parameter for this study will be the average percent “off” time during 
waking hours based on subject PD diaries collected at the end of each treatment period.  For each 
day it will be calculated as the number of ha lf-hour intervals in which “off” is checked.  The 
average percent “off” time will be defined as the average of percent “off” time (total “off” time 
divided by [CONTACT_290622] “asleep ,” (ie, waking hours) from the subject PD diaries completed 
for the 3 days immediately prior to the visit.  The difference between the average percent “off” 
time between treatments will be analyzed using a standard mixed-model analysis of variance at a

Amendment 2: October [ADDRESS_354626] PD diaries will be required if the PD diary is not 
completed for a day (6 am to 6 am).  In this case, the method of imputation will be dependent 
upon the amount and pattern of missing data:  
 If more than four half -hour time intervals are missing, then that particular day will not 
be included in the analysis.  
 If a half -hour time interval is missing and the observations on either side of the time 
interval are not missing, then the missing time interval will be imputed by [CONTACT_290636] a 
value of the previous measurement for the first 15  minutes and the value of the next 
measurement for the second 15 minutes.  
 If two or more consecutive half -hour time intervals are missing, not to exceed a total 
of four, and these time intervals are a vailable from other days of the visit, then the 
following rules will be applied:  
 For missing values on Day 1, data from Day 2 will be used for imputation for the 
same time intervals.  If Day 2 data is also incomplete then Day 3 data will be 
used.  
 For missi ng values on Day 2, data from Day 3 will be used for imputation if 
available; otherwise Day 1 data will be used.  
 For missing values on Day 3, data from Day 2 will be used for imputation if 
available; otherwise Day 1 data will be used for imputation.  
 If dat a at the same time period is missing across all days, the individual missing 
half-hour intervals will be split into two periods, with the first half -interval being 
imputed with data from the immediate previous nonmissing time period and the 
second half -interval being imputed with the next nonmissing time interval.  
14.8. Safety  
The safety analysis will include all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_354627] dictionary (Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]).  All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_6764], and by 
[CONTACT_290637] a body system, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_290638].  Each AE 
(based on preferred terminology) is counted only once for a given subje ct within a treatment .  If 
the same AE occurred on multiple occasions, the highest severity and least complimentary 
relationship was assumed.  If two or more AEs were reported as a unit, the individual terms will 
be reported as separate AEs.  
The incidence of treatment -emergent AEs, as well as, SAEs will be analyzed.  
The secondary safety variables including early termination data, laboratory test data, physical 
examination data, vital signs, ECGs, the C -SSRS and concomitant medications will be tabulated.  
Clinical laboratory values are to be summarized by [CONTACT_765], including change from baseline.  
Medically  significant laboratory values outside of normal reference ranges will also be tabulated 
and assessed.

that he/she is free to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.  
15.4. Study Monitoring  
Impax representatives or designees will conduct site visits to the investigational facilities for the 
purpose of monitoring the study.  The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the 
drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and study source 
documents, and other rec ords relevant to study conduct.  The Investigator must permit access to 
such records if a regulatory or compliance audit is required.  
15.5. Protocol Amendments  
All amendments to the protocol must be documented in writing, reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_290639], and submitted to the IRB for approval prior to implementation.  If the 
protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or potential risk to the subject, a new 
written ICF for continued participation in the study must be obtained fro m each subject affected 
by [CONTACT_134404].  
Protocol No. IPX203 -B16-01 CONFIDENTIAL  
Amendment 2: October [ADDRESS_354628] ensure that complete data for the clinical study are collected and 
accurately documented in the appropriate sections of the CRF and adequately supported by [CONTACT_89952].  In addition, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide 
signatures where requested indicating concurrence with data in the CRF.  
15.8. Investigator’s Final Conduct Report  
At the completion of the study, the Investigator must provide Impax a copy of the final conduct 
report that was submitted to their IRB, including a review of AEs.  
15.9. Records Rete ntion  
International Conference on Harmonization, GCP, and US FDA guidelines require that essential 
documents be retained until at least [ADDRESS_354629].

Synopsis, Methodology  During the IPX203 treatment period, the initial doses of IPX203 will be based on the subject’s prestudy stable LD regimen and the initial response to IPX203.  A 100- mg unit dose of IR  LD converts approximately 
to a 360- mg unit dose of IPX203.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_290607]203 will be three times a day, dosed approximately every [ADDRESS_354648]’s prestudy stable LD regimen and the initial response to IPX203.  A 100 -mg 
unit dose of IR  LD converts approximately to a 360- mg 
unit dose of IPX203.  The typi[INVESTIGATOR_290608]203 will be three times a day, dosed approximately every 7  to 8 hours.

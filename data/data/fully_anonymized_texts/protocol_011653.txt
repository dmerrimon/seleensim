Title of Protocol: An Open -Label, Phase 1, Dose -Escalation Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Antitumor Activity of TAK -676 With 
Pembrolizumab Following Radiation Therapy in the Treatment of Non –
Small -Cell Lung Cancer, Triple -Negative Breast Cancer, or Squamous -Cell 
Carcinoma of the Head and Neck that Has Progressed on Checkpoint 
Inhibitors.EudraCT No. : Not applicable
Study Number: TAK -676-1003 Phase: 1
Study Design:
This is an open -label, phase 1, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability , and preliminary antitumor 
activity  of TAK-676 and pembrolizumab following radiation therapy in the treatment of non –small - cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC), or squamous -cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) patien ts 
who have progressed on checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs).
Approximately 65 patients with metastatic NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN will be enrolled in this study, to achieve a 
maximum of 55 dose -limiting toxicity  (DLT) evaluable patients. All patients will receive 8 Gy × 3 doses of 
image -guided radiation therapy, followed by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) administration of pembrolizumab and TAK -676. 
Pembrolizumab will be administered at [ADDRESS_843028] fraction of radiation therapy and the initiation of IV pembrolizu mab. TAK -
676 will be administered 
in a dose -escalating fashion following the Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) design, with an explorable dose range of 
0.2 to 9.0 mg administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of ever y 21-day  cycle. Patients will only receive TAK -676 with 
pembrolizumab at dose levels that were previously deemed safe in the dose -finding phase 1 study TAK -676-
1002. 
Three patients will be enrolled in the initial cohort at the previously identified starting dose level of TAK -676. 
Subsequent cohorts will e nroll 2 to 3 patients per escalation/de -escalation guidelines. Administration of 
pembrolizumab (every 3 weeks) and TAK -676 (weekly) will continue until disease progression, intolerance to 
pembrolizumab or TAK -676 (defined as the development of a treatment -emergent adverse event [TEAE] that is at 
least possibly related to pembrolizumab or TAK -676 and for which dose discontinuation is recommended), or 
withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. 
Primary Objective:
The primary objective is:
To determine th e safety and tolerability of TAK -676 administered in combination with pembrolizumab following 
radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, TNBC or SCCHN.
Secondary Objectives:
The secondary objectives are:
To determine the reco mmended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK -676 administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab following radiation therapy. RP2D can be equal to or lower than the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD).
To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of TAK -676 administered in combination with pembrolizumab 
following radiation therapy, both locally (in the radiation field) and systemically (nonirradiated lesions).
To evaluate the dose -responsive impact on T -cell infiltration in nonirradiated tumors following TAK -676 
administered in combination with pembrolizumab following radiation therapy.
Patient Population: Healthy male or female patients aged [ADDRESS_843029] progressed on CPIs.

To guide dose escalation decisions, if the observed DLT rate at the current dose is ≤0.236, the next cohor t of patients 
will be treated at the next higher dose level; if it is ≥0.358, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next lower
dose level; if it is within 0.236 and 0.358, additional patients will be enrolled in this dose level. For the purpos e of 
overdose control, dose j and higher levels will be eliminated from further examination if Pr(p j>0.3 | data) >0.95, w here 
pjis the true DLT rate of dose level j. When the lowest dose is eliminated, the dose escalation will be stopped for 
safety. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum sample size (55 DLT -evaluable patients) is reached or the 
number of DLT evaluable pat ients treated at the current dose reaches 9. Isotonic regression method will be used on the 
cumulative DLT rate for each dose level to determine the MTD, defined as the highest TAK -676 dose in combination 
with radiation therapy and pembrolizumab that does not result in unacceptable toxicities.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
Overco ming T cell inhibit ion in the tumor microenvironment (TME) with checkpo int inhibitors 
(CPIs) has proven to be a successful strategy to produce long -term benefit in a significant number 
of patients wi th metastati c solid tumors. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_631730], many  patients with advanced 
cancer are either refractory  to CPIs or relapse after a period of tumor control, eventually 
succumbing to their disease. Evolving data suggest that reduced interferon (IFN) signaling, 
immune escape through human le ukocy te antigen loss, as well as altered antigen presentation may 
contribute to CPI [CONTACT_41634] (Jenkins et al. 2018 ; Minn and Wherry  2016 ; Sharma et al. 
2017) . Furthermore, an emerging consensus acknowledges that CPI [CONTACT_41634] (relapse or 
refractory  in nature) m ay also be driven by [CONTACT_631792], specifically those tumors 
harboring an immunosuppressive or “immune desert” phenotype. Accordingly, one possible 
strategy  to overcom e these elements of resistance is to stimulate innate immune cells (myelo id 
cells, including ant igen-presen ting dendrit ic cells [DCs], granulocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, or 
monocy tes/macrophages, as well as lymphoid cells, including gamma/delta T cells, natural killer 
[NK] cells, and NK T Cells) to condit ion the TME, thus turning immuno logically  “col d” tum ors 
into “hot” tum ors in which adapt ive immune responses can be effect ively activated.
Study  TAK -
676-1003 intends to evaluate the safety , tolerabilit y, and preliminary efficacy  of 
radiation therapy fo llowed by [CONTACT_631793] (STING) agonist TAK- [ADDRESS_843049] ion of t ypeI IFN -dependent innate immunit y 
(Ishikawa et al. 2009 )and is specifically  activated in the presence of cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) 
derived from bacteria or produced by  [CONTACT_552149] -AMP s ynthase (cGA S) (Sun et al. 2013; Wu et 
al. 2018 ). Emerging evi dence i ndicates th at the cGAS -STING pathway  plays an important role 
specifically in driving tumor surveillance (Corral es and Gajewski 2015 ). The presence of cytosolic 
DNA in tumor cells leads to cGAS -dependent production of the second messenger 2′,3′-cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate –adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which may subsequent ly be 
transmitted to professio nal ant igen-present ing cells in the TME. Ultimately, this leads to induct ion 
of type I IFNs in DC s (Marcus et al. 2018 ). Type I IFNs and downstream regulated 
cytokines/chem okines serve as a potent “alert” to immune cells, including T cells and NK cells 
that may  prime ant itumor responses. Downregulat ion of cGAS via epi[INVESTIGATOR_631731], underscoring the potential significance of STING signaling in

4.2 Radiation Therapy and the Innate and Adaptive Immune Response
Radiotherapy is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_631732] 50% of cancer patients receiving 
radiotherapy  at som e point in the course of their disease (Delaney et al. 2005 ). In the setting o f 
metastati c disease of so lid tumors, including non– small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple -negat ive 
breast cancer (TNBC), and squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), radiotherapy  is 
For non-commercial use only
TAK -[ADDRESS_843050] a llowed radi otherapy  to be 
delivered more precisely wit h such techniques as 3D conformal radiotherapy , image -guided 
intensity-modulated radi otherapy , and stereotactic ablat ive radiotherapy (Ahmad et al. 2012 ). 
With the increasing use of CPIs in these pat ients and the available evidence that radiat ion may 
enhance the immune response through activat ion of the STING pathway, there is much enthusiasm 
about combining radiat ion and CPI [INVESTIGATOR_631733] (Vatner et al. 
2014) . Radiotherapy  has often been thought of as immunosuppressive due to the large treatment 
fields depleting peripheral lymphocytes through direct cell killing (Yovi no et al. 2013
). However, 
there is clinical evidence that focal radiat ion in conjunct ion with immune checkpoint blockade 
(ICB) can lead not only to reduced tumor size in the radiation field but also to a sy stemic di sease 
response, termed the “abscopal response,” in pat ients with metastati c disease, including NSCLC 
(Form enti et al. 2018 ; Vatner et al . 2014 ). This is thought to be through the release of tumor 
antigens by [CONTACT_631794]-induced cell death in the context of endogenous adjuvants that facilitate 
priming of ant itumor lymphocy tes (Golden et al . 2012 ). This mechanism o f radiation-induced 
immunogenicit y invo lves the facilitat ion of tumor antigen uptake by [CONTACT_631795] -presentation on 
major histocompatibilit y complex I, which is shown to be upre gulated by [CONTACT_631796] (Formenti and Dema ria 2013 ; Reits et al . 2006 ). This enhanced presentation of 
antigens released by [CONTACT_631797] -priming of tumor -specific 
lymphocy tes in the lymph nodes, which may potentially prime an exhausted immune system in 
patients who are progressing on immunotherapy .
Local  radiotherapy  has been demonstrated to stimulate antitumor immune responses by [CONTACT_631798] (Liao et al. 2004 ). Local radiat ion may also work through a different  
mechanism, that of altering the TME to promote greater infiltration by [CONTACT_631799] 
(Lugade et al. 2008 ; Matsum ura et al. 2008 ; Zhang et al. 2007 ). Several studies have observed that 
the rapid reduct ion of tumor burden after ablat ive radiat ion therapy  depends on T cell responses 
(Gupta et al. 2012 ; Lee et al. 2009 ). Ablat ive radiation also increases T cell priming in draining 
lympho id tissues and reduces both the primary tumor and distant metastasis in a CD8 T cell –
dependent fashio n (Figure 4.a).
Preclinical tumor models have demonstrated that the immunogenic consequences of radiat ion are 
dependent on the cGAS/STING pathway  (Deng et al . 2014b ). Radi ation-induced DNA damage 
leads t o the generation of cytosolic DNA, which is sensed by [CONTACT_631800]. cGAS then catalyzes the 
producti on of  cGAMP, which act ivates STING in tumor cells and nearby [CONTACT_167301], result ing in 
downstream induct ion of IFN -β (Deng et al . 2014b ; Vanpouille -Box et al . 2017 ). IFN- β leads to 
enhanced ant igen uptake by [CONTACT_631801] -presentation to T cells (Deng et al . 2014b ). This 
recent ly redefined mechanism has bridged the tumor DNA damage response and host cell 
cytosoli c DNA -sensing pathways in the context of radiotherapy  (Figure 4.a).
The efficacy o f radiotherapy has been shown to depend on the host immune response, particularly 
the adaptive immune response. By  [CONTACT_42324]/necrosis of tumor tissues and subsequent 
release of DNA fragments and other danger signals, local high- dose radiation promotes 
inflammat ion (Apetoh et al. 2007) . The potential role of t ype I IFN in bridging the inflammat ion

CONFIDENTIALtumor-reducing adapt ive immune response (Burnette et al. 2011 ) (Figure 4.a). It has also been 
shown that radiat ion increases the production of IFNβ in the TME. The implications of this 
increase are significant. The therapeutic effect of radiat ion is diminished in an IFNα/β receptor 
knocko ut host (Burnette et al. 2011 ).
Preclinical work i n tum or-bearing mice treated with radiat ion and intratumoral STING agonists 
inject ion provi des evidence for an immune -mediated combinat ion benefit. Deng et al. 
demonstrated that intratumoral delivery  of the STING agoni st 2′3′-cGAMP potenti ates the 
response of MC38 tum ors to radiation, and this combinat ion benefit is dependent on the presence 
of STING in the host mice (Deng et al. 2014b ). Similarly, a synthetic STING agoni st (RR -CDG) 
delivered intratumorally to Panc02 tumors potentiated the effects of radiation to these tumors, and 
the combination resulted in systemic T cell –mediated tumor suppression, including at distant 
tumor sites (Baird et al . 2016 ).
Figure 4.a Radiation and Local Induction of Type I Interferon
Source: Deng et al, 2016 (Deng et al. 2016 ).
Cytosolic DNA sensing orchestrates tumor immunity during radiotherapy. Radiation results in the 
upregul ation of “find -me” and “eat -me” signals from tumor cells. During phagocytosis in mye loid 
cells, the DNA fragments hidden in irradiated tumor cells are re leased from phagosomes to 
cytoplasm, acting as a danger signal. The cy clase cGAS binds this DNA, becomes cataly tically 
active, and generates cGAMP as a second messenger. cGAMP binds to STING, which in turn

CONFIDENTIALIn vivo antitumor activit y of TAK -676 was also assessed in A20 tumors in BALB/c mice 
(syngeneic murine B Cell lymphoma model). TAK -676 exhib ited stati stically significant 
(p<0.001) antitumor activit y against the A20 tumor at both 1 and 2 mg/kg dose levels on a 
Q3D ×3 schedule. In 1 of 10 mice, complete regressio n was observed at 1 mg/kg, and in 2 of 
10mice, complete regressions were observed at 2 mg/kg.
The effect of TAK -676 on immune cell populat ions was evaluated in tumor -draining lymph nodes 
of C57BL/6J mice bearing B16F10 tumors (syngeneic murine melanoma model) by  [CONTACT_8315]. The resul ts dem onstrated DC activat ion within the lymph no des. In addit ion to

The absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and eliminat ion properti es of TAK -676 were 
characterized both in vitro and in vivo in BALB/c mice bearing A20 syngeneic tumors, 
Sprague Dawl ey rats, and cyno molgus monkeys after IV dosing. TAK -676 had high clearance in 
rats and moderate clearance in monkeys. The vo lume of distribut ion at steady  state after IV 
administration (V ss) of TAK -676 was moderate in rats and monkeys. TAK -676 showed little to no 
partitioning into red bl ood cells (RBCs). TAK -[ADDRESS_843057] –cannulated rats and monkeys, 
and the contribut ion of metabo lism to the clearance pathwa y in bile duct –cannulated monkeys was

[IP_ADDRESS] Observed Toxicity in Rats
TAK -676 was well tol erated in 2 exploratory  single -dose studies in Sprague Dawley  rats at doses 
up to 33.6 mg/kg (IV bolus) and in an exploratory  intermittent repeat- dose toxicit y study  in rats 
(BIW for 4 doses or QW for 3 doses) at doses up to 4.1 mg/kg (IV bolus). In the GLP repeat -dose 
toxicity study  in rats, TAK -676 was administered IV BIW (5 total doses) at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg 
via bolus (approximately  1-2minutes). In addition, IV infusio n arm s, where rats were 
administered either vehicle (50 mM citrate buffer, 0.5% sodium chloride in sterile water for 
inject ion) or TAK -676 at 40 m g/kg BIW (over approximately  10 minutes using an indwelling 
catheter), were also included to evaluate the potential for inject ion site findings, which may occur 
with longer exposures of TAK -[ADDRESS_843063] ion site. The tol erabili ty of TAK -676 decreased 
with repeated administration, causing removal o f animals earlier at 40 mg/kg (slow bo lus and 
infusio n) on Days 4 thro ugh 11 (animals received 2 to 4 doses) and on Day 15 at 10 and 20 mg/kg 
(after the 5th dose). In dead and/or moribund animals, TAK -676–related decreases in body weight 
and weight gain were observed that correlated with decreases in food consumption and cli nical  
observat ions of feces changes (loose, soft, liquid, or muco id); other observed signs included 
evidence of poor grooming (y ellow and/or brown stained, ungroomed, or erected fur); weakness,

[IP_ADDRESS] NSCLC
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer mortalit y in the US wi th an estimated 140,[ADDRESS_843067], and prostate cancer combined (Siegel et al. 2019 ). The majorit y of NSCLC patients present 
with metastati c disease. Recent ly, immunotherapy  with or wi thout chem otherapy  (depending on 
PD-L1 expression) has beco me the proven preferred first or second -line systemic therapy in 
patients without actionable tumor driver mutations (Borghaei et al. 2019 ; Gandhi et al. 2018 ; Reck 
et al. 2019 ). Similarly, radiat ion therapy  plays an important role in the m anagement of advanced 
NSCLC, whether in early or late -stage disease . Unfortunately, despi[INVESTIGATOR_631738], 
the vast majorit y of patients eventually develop resistance to immunotherapy and have disease 
progression.
[IP_ADDRESS] TNBC
TNBC represents up to 20% of all breast cancers and is defined by a lack of estrogen and 
progesterone receptor expressio n and the absence of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 
overexpressio n and/or amplificat ion (Foulkes et al . 2010 ). The lack of hormone expressio n 
precl udes the use of endocrine therapy , the backbone of treatment in metastatic hormone 
receptor -positive breast cancer. Thus, chemotherapy is the traditional mainstay  of treatm ent in 
meta static TNBC, with short -lived responses and limited prognosis in this patient populat ion (Li et 
al. 2017 ). There has thus been much excitement about the potential use of ICB in TNBC (Adams et 
al. 2019a ). Init ial studi es have sh own obj ective response rates, many wit h durabilit y, with ICB 
monotherapy  of up to 23% in first -line pat ients with PD -L1 posit ive tumors (Adams et al. 2019b ).

CONFIDENTIALNotably, the IMPASSION 130 phase 3 trial evaluated nab -pacli taxel  +/-atezolizumab in 902 
previously untreated metastatic TNBC and showed improved progression -free survival (PFS) of 
7.2 m onths in the atezolizumab arm co mpared with 5.5 months in the placebo arm  (p<0.002); 
median overall survival was 21.3 months in the atezolizumab arm versus 17.6 months wit h 
placebo (p =0.08), and an even greater benefit was seen in the PD -L1-posit ive populat ion (Schmid 
et al. 2018 ). Although this study init ially received accelerated approval for first -line use in pat ients 
with metastati c TNBC and posit ive PD -L1 expressio n levels, thi s approval has since been 
withdrawn ,further highlight ing the challenges in treating this type o f breast cancer. In contrast, 
recent results fro m the phase 3 Keynote -355 tri al showed a si gnificant increase in PFS (9.7 vs 5.6 
months; p = 0.0012) for patients with metastatic TNBC and a co mbined pos itive score ≥10 who 
were treated with pembro lizumab plus chemotherapy  (nab -pacli taxel, pacli taxel , or 
carbopl atin/gemcitabine) versus chemotherapy alo ne. On the basis of this study , pembrolizumab 
in co mbinat ion with chemotherapy for the treatm ent of patien ts with locally recurrent unresectable 
or metastati c TNBC whose tumors express PD -L1 (CPS ≥10) has been granted accelerated 
approval . Currently, once a patient progresses on either atezolizumab plus nab -pacli taxel or 
pembro lizumab plus chemotherapy, they m ay have the opti on of  being treated i n a later line with 
the ant ibody  drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, but beyo nd this, the treatment options remain 
limited.
[IP_ADDRESS] SCCHN
In 2020, an estimated 53,260 new cancers o f the oral cavit y and pharynx are expected to be 
diagnosed, and 10,750 people will die o f the disease. Key  risk factors for SCCHN are smoking, 
alcoho l consumpt ion, human papi[INVESTIGATOR_358545], and Epstein -Barr virus. Only  29% of  patients are 
diagnosed wi th localized disease that i s curable by [CONTACT_484126]. SCCHN has a predominant ly 
locoregi onal pattern of recurrence, with only 25% of patients presenting wit h distant metastases at 
recurrence, and this mostly to the lungs. Chemoradiat ion therapy  plays a cornerstone role in the 
treatm ent of l ocally advanced S CCHN both in a first -line definit ive or postoperative setting 
(National  Com prehensive Cancer Network 2020 ; Quon et al. 2017 ; Sher et al . 2017 ). More 
recent ly, pembrolizumab was FDA -approved in the first -line setting for the treatm ent of metastatic 
or unresectable SCCHN as mo notherapy  for pati ents wi th posi tive PD -L1 expression and in 
combinat ion with platinum and fluorouracil in pat ients whose tumors are PD- L1 negative. 
Nivo lumab is also approved for use in the second -line setting after progression on a 
platinum -containing agen t. Although the rol e of pembrolizumab combined wit h radi ation therapy  
is current ly being studied (Yu and Lee 2019 ), there is an unmet clinical need for those patients who 
have progressive disease (PD) while on CPI [INVESTIGATOR_631739].

radiation therapy  (SBRT) of 8 Gy  × 3 wi th either pembro lizumab or nivo lumab (RT given before 
the second cy cle of CPI) in bladder cancer and melano ma, respect ively (Sundahl  et al . 2019a ; 
Sundahl et al. 2019b) . Although small, each of these trials showed an ORR in the nonirradiated 
lesions of  approximately 45%. Addit ionally, the rando mized phase 2 PEMBRO -RT tri al noted 
above evaluated SBRT at 8 Gy  × 3 fo llowed by [CONTACT_631808]. While the 
resul ts of this study  did not reach stati stical significance, there was an observed improvement in 
ORR in nonirradiated lesio ns(36% vs 18%, p =0.07), median PFS (6.6 vs 1.9 months, p =0.19), 
and mOS (15.9 vs 7.6 months, p =0.16), suggesting the need for further explorat ion of this 
approach. These results, as well as the tolerable safety  profile seen in these and other studies 
utilizing SBRT at 8 Gy × 3 doses ( Table 4.b) (Maity et al. 2018 ; McBride et al. 2018 ; Voorwerk et 
al. 2019 ), support the use of this dosing schedule as a safe and adequately  immunogenic regimen.
Addit ionally, recent preclinical data appear to favor fract ionated radiotherapy  (8 Gy  × 3) over 
20Gy ×1 due to the abilit y of the 8 Gy  ×[ADDRESS_843070], the 20 Gy ×1 regimen upregulates 
the exonuclease Trex1, leading to cy tosolic DNA degradation and prevent ing the activat ion of 
cGAS and i ts downstream  effects (Vanpouille -Box et al . 2017 ).
4.5.3 Rationale for Proposed Starting Dose of TAK -676
To appropriately balance the potential risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_631740] (AEs) fro m immune 
stimulat ion in the cance r pati ent popul ation and the potential for pharmaco logic act ivity at the 
starting dose, the maximum reco mmended starting dose (MRSD) from the GLP -compliant 2- week 
repeat -dose monkey toxicit y study  (most sensi tive species) and the minimum ant icipated 
biological effect l evel (MABEL) were consi dered in select ing the starting dose of TAK -676. 
Please refer to the IB for addit ional details.
The dose of 0.2 mg TAK -676 corresponds to the MABEL. Furthermore, the dose of 0.06 mg/kg 
was considered both the HNSTD and N OAEL in the GLP -compliant 2 -week toxicit y study  in 
cyno molgus monkeys. Using this dose, the estimated MRSD in humans was 0.19 mg. This 
estimat ion was based both on body  surface area and AUC calculat ions and includes the 1/6th 
safet y factor calculat ion per ICH S9 and i s quasi -concordant with the MABEL-based dose 
calculat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Range
The proposed dose range for TAK -[ADDRESS_843071]-in-human ( FIH)study , where TAK -676 was administered by [CONTACT_631809] n once weekly  alone or in combinat ion with pembrolizumab, will provide init ial clinical 
data on the safet y and tol erabili ty of TAK -676 + pembrolizumab. In the combination arm o f the 
FIH study, TAK -676 is administered in a dose -escalat ing fashio n (starting at 0.2 mg IV on Days 1, 
8, and 15 of a 21
-day cycle) al ong wi th pembrolizum ab at the fixed dose of [ADDRESS_843072] 2 dose cohort s of the FIH combination arm 
before administering TAK -676 with pembro lizumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy in this study. The 
dose escalat ion phase of the TAK -676-1002 FIH study  is ongoing and no dose-limit ing toxicit ies 
(DLTs )or preliminary safet y/tolerabilit y concerns were observed at the preplanned interim safet y 
data review at 1.[ADDRESS_843073] dose level determined to be safe in the FIH study .
4.5.4 Rationale for Paired Biopsies and Blood Draws
Tumor and bl ood ti ssues will be collected to assess changes over time in the tumor and the innate 
and adapt ive immune response fo llowing treatment with radiat ion, pembrolizumab, and TAK -
676.
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Biopsies
Tumor biopsies of nonirradiated tumorsat baseline and on -treatm ent will be collected to determine 
modulat ion of the innate and adaptive immune response in the TME, including evaluat ion of T cell 
diversit y. These samples m ay also be evaluated for tumor mutational burden and to determine 
treatm ent effects in cancer cells and immune cells.
Induct ion of an innate and/or adaptive immune response in the tumor will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_631810] -based assays for 
evaluat ion of levels o f tumor infiltr ating lymphocytes and activat ion states of innate and adapt ive 
immune cell subsets. Addit ional analyses related to resistance, response or disease 
characterizat ion may be done on collected biopsies.
To minimize the risk of performing invasive procedures on patients at TAK -[ADDRESS_843074] ivity in peri pheral bl ood (refer Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Addit ionally , once the 
tumor biopsies are m andated, safely accessible paired biopsies will be co llected fro m all pat ients 
during dose escalat ion and addit ional pat ients are expected to be added if an expansio n phase i s 
supported ,to achi eve a greater than 0.8 predicted posterior probabilit y of increased immune 
infiltrat ion within the tum or (refer to Appendix K). However, pai red bi opsies are highly  desired 
and strongly  encouraged in all pat ients, regardless of dose level, if the lesions are deemed safely 
accessible. The specific anatomical location of the biopsy before resection must be specified.

can help in the understanding of the PK -pharm acodynamic relationship of TAK -676. Such data 
may also be useful in building mathematical models to describe the PK -pharm acodynamic and/or 
PK-safet y/efficacy relat ionship of TAK -[ADDRESS_843077] the time course 
of PK and pharmacodynamic effects of TAK -676. This informat ion may also help provide context 
for safet y findings from the study  and can be helpful in selecting the recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) and schedule for TAK -676.
4.[ADDRESS_843078] reported on the safety  of the combinat ion of radiation therapy  and 
pembro lizumab ( Table 4.b). Overall, the combinat ion was found to be safe wit h AEs similar to 
those commo nly associated wi th pembro lizumab. Most of the observed AEs were of Grade 1 and 
2, including dermat itis reported in 29% of patients in [ADDRESS_843079] ion, pneumo nitis, infusio n-related 
reacti on and wei ght loss. Rare Grade 4 AEs were observed, including Grade 4 adrenal 
insufficiency in 1 study .
An increased rate of radiat ion necrosis in pat ients with brain metastases from melanoma who 
received stereotactic radiosurgery  (SRS) and CPI [INVESTIGATOR_394772]. No reports of radiat ion necrosis 
were noted in pat ients with NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN recei ving radiat ion therapy  in 
combinat ion with pembrolizumab or other CPIs. In 1 study  evaluat ing pembro lizumab and 
multisite stereotactic body  radiotherapy  in 79 pati ents wi th advanced so lid tumors, toxicit y was 
generally low; however, when toxicit y was obser ved, i t appeared to be in the region that was 
irradi ated, which m ade i t difficul t to di stinguish between toxicit y of combinat ion therapy  versus

Nonclinical toxico logy studi es evaluat ing the combinat ion of TAK -676 and pembrolizumab were 
not conducted and are not warranted per ICH S9. Pembro lizumab is a monoclonal ant ibody  that 
binds to the human PD -1 receptor and blocks the interaction of PD -1 with PD-L1/PD -L2. 
TAK -676 at 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg was administered to tumor-bearing mice Q3D (Days 2, 5, and 9) 
alone or in combinat ion with 10 m g/kg ant i-mouse PD -1 antibody (Q3D×3 fo llowed by  [CONTACT_122967]×3).

Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies of Antitumor Activit y of TAK -676 in Combination With 
Radiation in Syngeneic Mouse Models:
Tolerabilit y, as assessed by [CONTACT_631813] y and BWL, was monitored in pharmaco logy studies 
in tum or-bearing mouse models where focal radiatio n was administered in co mbinat ion with 
TAK-676, with or without an ant i-PD-1 antibody. A regimen of 10 Gy × 1 radiation was delivered 
with the RS 2000 Small Animal Irradiator using a lead box to provide shielding, with a small ho le 
to provi de access to the tum or. A regimen o f 8 Gy  × 3 radi ation was delivered with the SARRP 
(Small Animal Radiat ion Research Platform) with 3D volumetric image guidance for target 
localizat ion and dose delivery , which minimizes exposure to nontargeted tissues and organs and 
allows higher total doses of radiat ion to be delivered to the tumor.

–In 1 study , TAK -676 at 1 mg/kg was administered to EMT6 tumor -bearing mice on a 
Q3D×3 schedule (Days 2, 5, and 8) alone or in combinat ion with 10 Gy radiat ion on 1 of 5 
different day s (Day  0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). A radiat ion alo ne arm, where 10 Gy  radiation was 
given once on Day  2 was also included. All groups contained 10 mice each. Transient 
BWL was observed in all groups. Maximum mean BWL in single agent groups was 4.1% 
and 2.3% for TAK -676 and radiation respectively, while maximum mean BWL in the 
5combination groups ranged from 7.0 % to 10.1%. BWL resulted in the removal o f 2 of 
50mice receiving TAK -676 in co mbinat ion with 10 Gy  radiation. These mice, which 
received TAK -676 + 10 Gy  radiation on Day  4, were rem oved from  the study  on Days 11 
and 33.

Q3D×3 (Day s 2, 5, and 8) alone or in co mbination with 10 Gy radiat ion on 1 of 3 different 
days (Day 0, 2, or 4). Radiat ion alone arms, where 10 Gy radiat ion was given once on Da y 
0, 2, or 4 were also included. All groups con tained 10 mice each. Transient BWL was 
observed in all treatment groups but was considered tolerable as mean BWL was <11% in 
all groups and no mice met criteria for removal from study  due to BWL. Maximum mean 
BWL in single agent groups was 1. 7% and 0.9% to 5.2% for TAK -676 and radiat ion

agent groups was 4.9%, 8%, 9.7%, and 9.3% for TAK -676, Day  [ADDRESS_843085] ively. BWL in these single -agent groups resulted in 
the rem oval of  1 mouse (of 10) on Day  11 that received 10 Gy  radiat ion on Day  4. In 
combinat ion groups, BWL was addit ive, result ing in a maximum  mean BWL of 14.3%, 
13.6%, and 15.6% for TAK -676 + radiat ion on Day 0, 2, or 4, respectively. In combinat ion 
groups, BWL resulted in the early removal of 5 of 10 mice (on Day s 4 and 7) wi th

8Gy × 3 radi ation followed by  [CONTACT_14181]-PD-1 antibody. All groups contained 8 mice each. 
Transient BWL was observed in all treatment groups. Maximum mean BWL in single -agent 
groups was 3.7%, 1.6%, 7.8%, and 0.2% for radiatio n, 0.25 mg/kg TAK -676, 1 mg/kg 
TAK -676, and ant i-PD-1 groups, respectively. Ma ximum mean BWL in the group which 
received radiation and ant i-PD-1 was 3.8%. In the groups that received 8 Gy × 3 fo llowed by 
[CONTACT_4129] -676 at 1 m g/kg, wi th anti-PD-1 or i sotype control , the m aximum  mean BWL was 9.0% 
and 9.9%, respectively. Maximum mean BWL of t he group receiving 8 Gy  × 3 wi th 
0.25 mg/kg TAK -676 and ant i-PD-1 was 1.8%. The combinat ion was considered tolerable as 
no mice were removed for BWL during the study .
Taken together, these results indicate that in EMT6 tumor -bearing mice, TAK -676 at 1 mg/k g was 
well tolerated in combinat ion with 8 Gy × 3 radiat ion delivered through an advanced image -guided 
system  to minimize norm al tissue radi ation exposure. BWL was <10% and no treatment -related 
mortalit y was observed. The addit ion of an ant i-PD-1 antibody  to thi s regimen did not result in 
additional BW L or m ortali ty. In EMT6 mice, TAK -676 at 1 mg/kg was also generally well 
tolerated in co mbinat ion with 10 Gy  × 1 radi ation delivered without image guidance, with 7% to 
11% m aximal mean BWL in 8 combinat ion gro ups (n =80 mice total), with the except ion of the

Approximately  65 pati ents wi th metastati c NSCLC, TNBC, or SCCHN will be enrolled in this 
study , to achi eve a maximum of 55 DLT evaluable patients for the dose escalat ion of TAK -676 
administered along with pembro lizumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy . 
6.3 Duration of Study
6.3.1 Duration of an Individual Patient’s Study Participation
Patient parti cipat ion will include screening, treatment, and fo llow-up. Screening will last up to [ADDRESS_843101] dose of radiat ion, during which the pat ient’s eligibilit y and baseline 
characterist ics will be determined. Treatment with TAK -676 wi th pembro lizumab will be 
administered for up to 24 months or until pat ients meet any  of the di scontinuati on cri teria in 
Secti on8.4.5 , Secti on 8.4.6 , or Section 9.7. Pati ents wi th dem onstrated clinical benefit may 
continue treatment bey ond 24 m onths wi th the agreem ent of  the sponsor. These patients can 
continue receiving treatment in this study  or any  of the poststud y access m odali ties described in 
Secti on6.3.5 .
All patients will attend an end of treatment (EOT) visit 30 days (+10 days) after receiving their la st 
dose of study drug or before the start of subsequent systemic ant icancer therapy, whichever occurs 
first, to permi t detecti on of  any delayed TEAEs and to resolve any  ongoing events. If a patient is 
not able to return for the EOT visit, the EOT assessmen ts may be perform ed at the time of 
treatm ent discont inuat ion following discussio n wit h the sponsor. Patients with unreso lved TEAEs 
will cont inue the periodic safet y follow-up unt il complete resol ution or stabilizati on (established 
as sequelae) occurs. Pati ents who receive at least 1 dose of radiation and discont inue study  
treatm ent for reasons other than PD will cont inue follow -up every 12 ±[ADDRESS_843102] (Section 9.8).
6.3.2 End of Study/Study Completion Definition and Plann ed Reporting
The ant icipated duration of this study will be approximately 30 mo nths (from first patient first visit  
to last pati ent last visit) . The final data cutoff for the CSR will be conducted after all patients have 
been discont inued fro m treatm ent or transferred to a long- term safet y study  or a similar program 
(Secti on 6.3.5 ).

TAK -676 will be administered IV on a dosing schedule of Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21 -day cycle. 
Alternate dosing schedules of administration in combinat ion with pembro lizumab may also be 
considered d uring dose escalat ion if the collective data including safety, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics support it, without requiring a protocol amendment.
Administrati on shoul d always be perform ed on schedul e; however, if extenuat ing circumstances 
prevent a patient from beginning treatment on a particular dosing day, a -1/+2
-day window will be 
allowable for all cycles except for Cycle 1. During subsequent cycles, if the Day 1 dose schedule is 
altered, i t is preferred to also shift the Day 8 and Day 15 doses and maintain a 21-day cycle. If the 
Day 8 or Day  15 dose scheduled is altered, it is preferred to return to the original schedule for the 
subsequent dose. If a patient misses a dose outside of this window, that dose will be considered 
missed and dosing will resume at th e next scheduled dosing timepo int. Based on emerging data 
(eg, severit y of infusi on-related reacti ons), infusio n time may  be adj usted to l ess than or greater 
than [ADDRESS_843135] be recorded. 
Prem edicat ion for infusio n is no t recommended init ially, but also may be added based on emerging 
data and upon agreement with the sponsor and investigators.
For a dministrations of TAK -676, vi tal signs will  be m easured immediately  before the start of the

potenti al MTD estimat ion. Three patients will be enro lled in the init ial cohort at the previously 
ident ified starting dos e level of TAK -676. Subsequent cohorts will enroll 2 to 3 patients per the 
escalat ion/de-escalati on guidelines outlined in Table 6.a. The target toxicit yrate is ϕ= 0.3. It is 
generally expected that at least [ADDRESS_843144] been

investigators, may  opt to enroll  a 2-patient cohort at that same [radiation] + TAK -676 +

decisio ns, if the observed DLT rate at the current dose is ≤0.236, the next cohort of patients will be 
treated at the next higher dose level; if it is ≥ 0.358, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the 
next lower dose level; if it is wit hin 0.236 and 0.358, addit ional patie nts will be enrolled in this 
dose l evel. For the purpose of overdose control, dose j and higher levels will be eliminated from

8.4 Dose Modification Guidelines
Decisio ns regarding which study  drug requi res dose m odificat ion will be dependent upon the 
toxicity, its onset, and i ts time course. The causal relat ionship o f any reported events (AEs or 
SAEs) should be assessed by [CONTACT_631822], TAK -676, and 
pembro
lizumab. After discussio n between the investigator and the sponsor, alternat ive dose 
modificati ons m ay be reco mmended to maximize exposure of study treatment while protecting 
patient safet y. Discussio ns and agreements will be documented.
General Principles
Treatment with TAK- 676 in co mbination wit h pembrolizumab fo llowing radiat ion therapy  will 
occur i n 21-day cycles. Toxi cities are to be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0. 
All toxicit ies that occur during the study  will be actively  managed foll owing the SOC unless 
otherwi se specified in the protocol. The causal relationship of any reported eve nts (AEs or SAEs) 
shoul d be assessed by [CONTACT_631823] , pembrolizumab, and/or 
TAK -676. Pati ents experiencing AEs attributed to TAK -[ADDRESS_843149] doses of TAK -676 reduced after 
consultation with the sponsor. When a dose reduction occurs, the TAK -676 dose will be reduced to 
the next lower dose that has been established as a safe dose during dose escalat ion. If init ial dose 
adjustm ent does not provi de sufficient relief, the dose of TAK -676 can be further reduced if the 
treating physician considers that the patient is benefit ing fro m study treatment. If TAK -676 dosing 
is delayed for more than 21 day s for TAK -676–related o r possibly  related toxici ties, despi [INVESTIGATOR_631752] [ADDRESS_843150] study  treatm ent discont inued.

CONFIDENTIALFor AEs that occur during the study  but are not relate d to TAK -676 or pembro lizumab, the dose 
modificati on of  TAK -676 and/or pembro lizumab, in principle, is not required. However, these 
situations should be discussed with the medical mo nitor. Depending on medical condit ions and the 
possibilit y of potential wo rsening of toxicit ies by [CONTACT_631824] -676 and/or 
pembro lizumab, invest igators can decide to have the TAK -676 and/or pembrolizumab dose held 
or reduced (in the case of TAK -676) until the reso lution of the AE in consultat ion with the sponsor, 
as needed.
Dose m odificat ion gui delines for toxi cities are described in Table 8.fand  Table 8.gfor TAK - [ADDRESS_843151] igators. Further 
clarificati on can be obtained in consultat ion wit h the sponsor. The pembrolizumab dose cannot be 
reduced; it may only be skipped (ie, patient is not dosed), interrupted (ie, dosing is paused during 
infusio n), or di scont inued.
8.4.1 Criteria for Administering a Subsequent Dose/Starting a New Cycle
Treatment with TAK- [ADDRESS_843152] m eet the following criteria: 
ANC ≥1000/µL, pl atelet count ≥75,000/µL, and hemoglo bin ≥8.0 g/dL.
Total  bilirubin ≤1.[ADDRESS_843153]. For patients with Gilbert’s disease, ≤3 mg/dL.
Serum  ALT and AST ≤3.[ADDRESS_843154] (or ≤5.[ADDRESS_843155] with presence of liver 
metastases).
Albumin ≥3.0 g/dL.
Estimated creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft -Gaul t formula ≥30 mL/min.
Oxygen saturation of ≥92% on room  air.
Before administering a subsequent dose or starting a new treatment cycle, TAK -676–related 
and/or pembro lizumab -related AEs or clinically  significant l aboratory  abnorm alities must have 
returned to G rade ≤1 or baseline, except for alopecia, Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, and/or 
autoimmune endocrinopathies with stable endocrine replacement therapy . For clinically 
significant lab values that occur during the study  but are not rel ated to TAK -676 or 
pembr olizumab, the dose modificat ion of TAK -676 and/or pembrolizumab, in principle, is not 
requi red. However, these situations should be discussed and documented with the medical mo nitor 
before administering a subsequent dose.
If the pat ient fails to meet the a bove
-cited cri teria for retreatment, treatment should be held (in the 
case of a subsequent dose) or delayed (in the case of starting a new cycle) by [ADDRESS_843156] been

TAK -676 administration was associated with pulmonary  changes in mo nkeys (please refer to the 
IB for details) that could resemble vascul ar leak or noncardiogenic pulmo nary edema in humans. 
To m onitor for this potential side effect and minimize the clinical risk to patients, the following 
will be performed for patients enrolled:
Vital signs will  be collected before, during and aft er administration of TAK -676.
On T AK-676 dosing days in Cycle 1, an addit ional postdose physical examinat ion will include 
an assessment of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517] . 
Oxygenat ion shoul d be carefully  monitored and maintained as clinically  indicated. Careful 
diagnosis and aggressive correction of pulmo nary symptoms should occur quickly.

and/or hy poxia caused by [CONTACT_631827]. CRS m ay be associated with cardiac, hepat ic 
and/or renal dysfunct ion. Severe CRS complicat ions are life -threatening and frequent ly require 
intensive care unit (ICU) care with vasopressor and/or vent ilation support.
CRS should be graded fo llowing NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0. Treatment guidelines are provided 
below; management of CRS requires close collaboration with specialists in neuro logy, 
pulmo nology, cardi ology , radi ology, and/or cri tical care m edicine, as necessary . Given the 
potenti al risk of  CRS, the on -site pharmacy  must confi rm that anti –IL- 6 agents, such as

Invest igators should different iate CRS from other crit ical clinical condit ions, including 
infusio n
-related reacti ons, sepsis, capi[INVESTIGATOR_304853] e, and hemophagocy tic 
lympho -histiocytosis/macrophage activat ion syndrom e. Fever is an importa nt clinical sign that 
shoul d raise the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n of impending CRS. If fever develops, inst itutional guidelines for 
management should be fo llowed and pati ents should be frequent ly reassessed for signs of CRS. 
Strongly consider admissio n for close observatio n. For patients experiencing Grade ≥2 CRS, ECG 
telemetry  is recommended. Echocardiogram could be obtained as clinically indicated.
The diagnosis and m anagement of CRS is based on clinical parameters as described in Table 8.i. 
Ferri tin, C- reactive protein, and serum cytokine levels should NOT be used for clinical 
management decisio ns.
To further mit igate the risk o f CRS during this study , vital signs will be measured frequent ly 
during and after infusio n of TAK -676. Cl ose m onitori ng of vital signs and clinical  condi tion will 
continue if the patient experiences symptoms that could be cons istent wi th CRS. If a patient 
experiences a temperature ≥100.4°F (38°C) at any time on study, they will be instructed to call the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97318] . 
Shoul d symptoms consistent with CRS develop, see Table 8.ffor TAK -676 dose m odificat ion. If 
TAK -676 i s held, pembrolizumab will also be held until TAK -676 is resumed, or if TAK -676 i s

For all patients, radiographic assessments of the disease will be performed at screening/baseline 
(within [ADDRESS_843215] study radiat ion treatment), once at the end of Cycle 2 (Day 15 to 22 
[predose]), then at the end of every 3 cycles (Day 15 to 22 [predose]) for the first year, and then at 
the end of every  6 cycles (+7 da ys) thereafter until PD or the start of alternat ive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Tumor assessments for all pat ients will cont inue as scheduled per protocol even if dosing is 
interrupted. If the patient has had an appropriate CT or MRI scan performed within [ADDRESS_843216] (v.1.1) criteria and modified itRECI ST criteria (where intratumoral 
therapy  references are l argely  replaced wi th radiation therapy).
For thi s study , CT and/or MRI scans should be acquired with IV contrast unless contraindicated. 
CT scans of the neck (required for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcino ma and if 
clinically indicated for patients with TNBC and NSCLC), chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be 
obtained at screening. Before radiat ion therapy , the radi ology oncol ogist and m edical  oncol ogist

irradi ated and noni rradiated response at each timepoint as depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 9.aaligning with 
principles akin to th ose of  itRECIST (where intratumoral therapy  references are l argely  replaced

According to the inclusio n criteria, pati ents m ust have at least 2 measurable lesio ns (ie ,>10mm 
longest di ameter for extranodal lesio ns, >15 mm short axis for lymph nodes), with at least one 
inside and at least one other outside of the radiation field. As stated in Sect ion 8.1.1, [ADDRESS_843219] ion of target lesio ns in a previously

of other responsive target lesio ns (pseudo -progressio n).
3.Durable stable disease (SD) may represent antitumor activit y of immunotherapy .
Therefore, allowances to RECIST v.1.[ADDRESS_843223] v.1.1 -defined

1.Invest igator -assessed overall clinical benefit fro m continued treatment with pembro lizumab 
and/or TAK -676. The assessment of clinical benefit should consider whether the patient is 
clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit fro m continued treatment.
2.Tolerance of study  drug(s).
3.Stabl e performance status.
4.Treatment bey ond apparent progression will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent 
serious com plicat ions of PD (eg, central nervous system metastases).
5.Patient-provided written informed consent describing any reasonably foreseeable risks or

Plasma sam ples will be collected to monitor the treatment -induced changes in peripheral 
biomarkers, including cy tokines and chemokines (for example IP -10, an IFN -inducible 
chemokine). The changes in cytokines and chemokines will be used to identify potential 
pharmacodynamic act ivity. Additional analysis may  explore whether l evels of any  of these

shoul d occur when a subsequent scan confirms the init ial PD, unless there are earlier clear 
signs of rapid clinical progressio n (clinical progressio n is defined as no imaging test performed 
to assess tumor status, but the inve stigator considers that patient decline is caused by [CONTACT_631840]).
Symptom atic deteri oration (the patient presents a decline in health that recommends 
terminating treatment, and tumor imaging is performed and does not qualify for PD).

9.10 Study Compliance
Radiation treatment and study  drug (s)will be administered or dispensed only to eligible pat ients 
under the supervisio n of the invest igator or ident ified subinvestigator(s). The appropriate study  
personnel will maintain records of study  drug receipt and dispensing.
Tests and procedures shou ld be performed on schedule; however, unless otherwise specified, 
occasi onal changes are allo wable wi thin a 3 -day window for holidays, vacat ions, and other 
administrative reasons. If extenuat ing circumstances prevent a patient fro m beginning treatment or 
completing a scheduled procedure or assessment wit hin this t ime, the patient may continue the 
study  only  with the wri tten permissio n of the medical mo nitor. If an AE occurs after study

the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event or a previous condit ion that has increased i n severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
All abnorm al laboratory  values will be reviewed by [CONTACT_631841], dose m odificat ion, therapeutic 
intervent ion, or are considered by [CONTACT_140800] a clinically significant change fro m 
baseline will be assessed as AEs.
10.1.[ADDRESS_843236] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see 
clarificati on in the paragraph in Sect ion 10.2 on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disab ility is defined as a 
substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect.
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, 
based on appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient, require medical or 
surgi cal interventi on to prevent [ADDRESS_843237] ious agent. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or th e 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent. In addit ion to the above examples, any event 
that the investigator considers to be medically important will be considered an SAE.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Versi on 5.0. Clarificat ion should be made between an SAE and an AE that 
is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4) because the terms serious and severe are NOT

CONFIDENTIALsynonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the intensit y (severit y) of a specific 
event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 
3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
criteria described above and is usually associated wit h events that pose a threat to apatient’s life or 
abilit y to funct ion. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. 
For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000/mm3is considered Grade 3 
(severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_4170] m study  
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a com mon underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as a single comprehensive event.
Regardless o f causalit y, SAEs (as defined in Sect ion 10.1.3 ) must be reported (see Section 10.3 for 
the period of observation) by [CONTACT_631842] 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. This should be done by [CONTACT_631843] (EDC) SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feasible 
within [ADDRESS_843238] 
be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF. 
In case of faxing a paper -based SAE form, site personnel need to confirm successful transmiss ion 
of all pages and include an email address on the fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of 
recei pt can be returned via email wit hin 1 business day .

For both serious and nonserious AEs, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxi city 
grade) of the e vent and the relat ionship of the event to study drug administration. 
Severit y (toxi city grade) for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will  be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Version 5.0. The cri teria are provided in the Study  Manual.
Relations hip of the event to study  drug administratio n (ie, its causali ty) will be determined by  [CONTACT_4175] y es (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug/s?

according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local or regional regulatory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the responsibilit ies of the invest igato r that are listed in Appendix B. 
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable requirements of each participat ing 
region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names and titles of members 
who make up the respect ive IRB or IEC. If any member of the IR B or IEC has direct participat ion

The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval o f the protocol and subject informed consent must be 
obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before commencement of the study , ie, before 
shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug or study -specific screening act ivity. The IRB or IEC 
approval  must ref er to the study  by [CONTACT_4193], number, and versio n date; ident ify 
versio ns of other documents (eg, ICF) reviewed; and state the approval date. If required by [CONTACT_4194], approval from the com petent regulatory  authori ty will be 
obtained before commencement of the study  or impl ementati on of  a substant ial amendment. The 
sponsor will notify  site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy  of site regul atory  
docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has received permissio n from the com petent 
authori ty to begin the study . Unt il the site receives notification, no protocol activit ies, including 
screening, may  occur.
Sites m ust adhere to all requirements stipulat ed by  [CONTACT_4195]. This may include 
notification to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the ICF, recruit ment 
materi als intended for viewing by  [CONTACT_1766], l ocal safety reporting requirements, reports and 
updates regarding the ongoing review of the study  at intervals specified by [CONTACT_4196], and submissio n of the invest igator’s final status report to IRB or IEC. All IRB and IEC 
approval s and rel evant docum entati on for these i tems must be provi ded to the spons or (or 
designee).
Patients incent ives should not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by [CONTACT_4197].
15.2 Patient Information, Informed Consent, and Patient Authorization
Written consent documents will e mbody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF describes the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and 
disclosures of the patient’s personal and personal health informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study. The ICF and the patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefit s, and the date informed consent is given. The 
ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at 
any time wit hout giving a reason and wit hout prejudice to his or her further medical care.
The investigator is respon sible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and, if applicable, the patient authorization form. The ICF, patient authorizat ion form (if 
applicable), and patient information sheet (if applicable) must be approved by [CONTACT_28150] o r IEC 
and the sponsor before use.
The ICF, patient authorization form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective pat ient. It is the 
responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, patient authorizat ion 
form (if applicable), and patient informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the patient. Information should 
be given in both oral and wr itten form whenever possible and in the manner deemed app ropriate by

the pati ent’s l egally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the patient in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulat ions.
The patient, or the patient’s legally acceptable representative (if acceptable at site), must be given 
ample opportuni ty to (1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether to participate in 
the study. If the patient, or the patient’s legally acce ptabl e representative, determines that he or she 
will part icipate in the study , then the ICF and patient authorizat ion form (if applicable) must be 
signed and dated by  [CONTACT_102], or the patient’s legally  acceptable representative, at the time of 
consent and before the patient enters into the study. The patient or the patient’s legally acceptable 
representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using a 
ballpo int pen wi th either blue or bl ack ink. The investigator must als o sign and date the ICF and 
patient authori zation (if applicable) at the time of consent and before the patient enters into the 
study; however, the sponsor may  allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the ori ginal  ICF, pati ent authori zation form (if applicable), and pat ient informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document 
the date the patient signs the informed consent in the patien t’s medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_4082], the si gned patient authorizat ion form (if applicable), and pat ient information sheet (if 
applicable) shall be given to the patient.
All revised ICFs must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_631846]’s legally 
acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed consent. The date the 
revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the patient’s medical record, and the patient 
shoul d receive a copy  of the revised ICF.
15.3 Patient Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the patient’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a pati ent’s source data will be linked to the 
sponsor’s clinical study  database or docum entati on only via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_39823], limited patient attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and patient initials may be used to verify the pat ient and accuracy  of the pati ent’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, US FDA, [LOCATION_006] MHRA, Japan PMDA), the sponsor’s designated auditors, 
and the appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the patient’s original medical records (source data or 
docum ents) including, but not limited to, laboratory test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n and 
discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1684] a patient’s study participat ion, and

CONFIDENTIALAppendix EBOIN Design
The Bayesian Optimal INterval (BOIN) design (Liu and Yuan 2015 )will be used to guide the dose 
escalat ion decisio ns and MTD est imation. This trial was designed and will be conducted using the 
software BOIN that is available at www.trialdesign.org. 
The target toxicit y rate is 0.3. During the study , if the observed DLT rate at the current dose is 
≤0.236, the next cohort of patients will be treated at the next higher dose level; if it is ≥0.358, the 
next cohort will be treated at the next lower dose level; if it is wit hin 0.[ADDRESS_843306] d ose level is eliminated, stop the 
escalat ion for safet y. Unless such early stop happens, dose escalation will cont inue unt il the 
maximum sample size is reached, or escalation will be stopped if the number of pat ients treated at 
the current dose reaches 9 a nd the recommendat ion is to retain at the current dose level. The dose 
escalat ion algorithm is described as the fo llowing steps:
Step 1. Patients in the first cohort are treated at lowest dose level.
Step 2. Decide the dose level for the next cohort according to the rule shown in Table 1. Please 
note the fo llowing when using Table 1:
1.“Eliminate” means that the current dose level and all higher dose levels are eliminated to 
prevent treating any  future pati ents at these overly  toxic dose levels.
2.When a dose l evel is eliminated, automat ically de -escalate to the next lower level. When the 
lowest dose l evel is eliminated, stop the dose escalation for safet y. In thi s case, no dose level 
shoul d be selected as the MTD.
3.If none of the actions (ie, escalat ion, de-escalat ion, or eliminat ion) is triggered, the next cohort 
will be treated with the current dose.
4.If the current dose is the lowest dose level and the rule indicates a de -escalation, treat the next 
cohort at the lowest dose level unless the number of DLTs reaches the eliminat ion boundary, at 
which po int the dose escalat ion should be terminated for safet y.
5.If the current dose is the highest dose and the rule indicates an escalat ion, treat the next cohort 
at the highest dose. 
Step 3. Repeat Step 2 un til the maximum sample size is reached or until a certain number of 
patients (n = 9) have already been treated with the current dose level and the recommendat ion is to 
retain at the current dose level.

DLT: dose -limiting toxicity; NA: not applicable.
Number of DLTs is the number of patients with at least 1 DLT.
After the dose escalat ion is complete, the MTD is selected based on isotonic regressio n as 
specified in (Liu and Yuan 2015 ). Specifically , the dose i s selected as the MTD for which the 
isotoni c estimate of the toxicit y rate is closest to the target toxicit y rate. If there are ties, the higher 
dose l evel is selected when the isotonic est imate is lower than the target toxicit y rate; the l ower 
dose l evel is selected when the isotonic est imate is greater than or equal to the target toxicit y rate.
The operating characterist ics of the BOIN design are evaluated with simulat ions assuming various 
distribut ions of toxicit y across dose levels shown in Table 2.

CONFIDENTIALAppendix HResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1)
All sites of  disease, target, and nontarget lesions must be assessed at baseline. Object ive disease 
status is to be recorded at each evaluat ion using the response categories and definit ions provided in 
this secti on.
All sites of  measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesio ns per organ, 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all invo lved organs, shoul d be ident ified as target lesio ns at baseline. Target 
lesions shoul d be selected based on size (longest lesions) and suitabilit y for reproducible repeated 
measurements. Measurements must be provided for target site of measurable lesio ns.
Disease Response Criteria for Target and Nontarget Lesions
Evaluation of Target Lesions
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum LD.
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new 
lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
CR: Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All 
lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.
PD: Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. (Note: the appearance of 1 or 
more new lesions is also considered progression).
Source: (Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ). 
CR: complete response; LD: longest diameter; PD: progressive disease; PR: partial response; SD: stable disease.

CONFIDENTIALAppendix KStatistical Considerations for Paired Biopsies
While biopsies are requested of all pat ients with safely  accessible nonirradiated/abscopal lesions 
(in the opi [INVESTIGATOR_35272]), safely accessible biopsies will become ma ndatory  once 
evidence of peripheral immune act ivation is observed during dose escalat ion. Pending successful 
completion of the dose escalat ion phase o f the study, it is ant icipated that addit ional pat ients will 
be evaluated in future dose expansion. In the future dose expansio n cohort, we hope to demonstrate
abiologically and statist ically meaningful increase of T -cell infiltrat ion into tumors after treatm ent 
of TAK -676 + pembrolizumab + radiation. A certain number of paired patient biopsies (fro m a 
single indicati on and dose level) in the escalat ion and expansio n cohorts may be needed to achieve 
our desired statist ical confidence. To evaluate that, we surveyed the literature for the level o f T-cell 
infiltrat ion into tumors treated with immune onco logy agen ts in various tumor types (Chalabi et al. 
2020; Ferrarotto et al. 2020 ; Steel e et al. 2018 ; Tumeh et al. 2014 ). Evaluat ion of published results 
suggest that CPI[INVESTIGATOR_24258]-mediated T -cell infiltration can resul t in approximately 1.[ADDRESS_843311] imated coefficient of variat ion of 80% to 180% in majorit y 
of the studi es. On the basis o fthese data, we assumed a 2.5
-fold increase and a coefficient of 
variat ionof 130% to project the minimum number of paired biopsies that are needed to achieve a 
0.8 posterior probabilit y of achieving a 1.5 -fold increase in T cells aftertreatm ent,with a 
probabilit y of success of 80%. On the basis o fthese assumptions, we projected that [ADDRESS_843312] ical goal is expected to be greater than 11 patients and will 
be based on biopsy qualit y and interpretabilit y (refer to Stati stical Analysis Plan for addit ional

Statistical Considerations
Section 6.1 Overview of Study Design
Section 6.1.1 Dose Escalation of 
TAK -676
Section 8.3 Dose Escalation RulesAdded the following clarifying text:
It is generally expected that at least 
3patients will enroll per cohort. 
However, if no DLTs have been 
identified in the TAK -676 + 
pembrolizumab dose level that has 
already  been evaluated in the 
dose-finding phase 1 TAK -676-1002 
study, the sponsor, in agreement with 
the TAK -676-1003 investigators, 
may opt to enroll a 2 -patient cohort at 
that same [radiation] + TAK -676 +

current dose level reaches 9 and the 
recommendation is to retain at the 
current dose le vel.Clarification to 
describe the BOIN 
escalation rule more 
accurately.
14 Section 8.4 Dose Modification 
GuidelinesClarified that discussions and 
agreements regarding dose 
modifications will be documented 
and that possible dose modifications 
due to AEs not related to study drug 
should be discussed with the medical 
monitor.Clarification.
15 Section 8.4.1 Criteria for 
Administering a Subsequent 
Dose/Starting a New CycleClarified criteria for holding or 
delay ing treatment in the event of 
failing to meet retreatment criteria. 
Clarified that dose modifications due 
to clinically significant lab values not 
related to study drug are not required 
but should be discussed and 
documented with the medical monitor 
before the next dose.Clarification.

N/A; first time submission  
3) Objectives  
 
1. To evaluate the effects of vasopressin on chest tube output and duration following the 
Fontan operation 
Hypothesis 1: Vasopressin at a dose of 0.3-0.5 mU/kg/min will reduce chest tube output 
and duration relative to placebo in patients following the Fontan operation. 
 
2. To evaluate if the use of vasopressin following the Fontan operation will influence total 
length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374947] 2: Vasopressin at a dose of 0.3- 0.5 mU/kg/min will reduce total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374948]. 
 
3. To evaluate low dose vasopressin for safety in this population 
Hypothesis 3: There will be no significant difference in adverse events between t he 
vasopressin and placebo groups. 
 
 
 
 
4) Background 
The Fontan operation is the third and final procedure in palliation of patients with si ngle 
ventricle physiology. Several modifications have been adopted since its establishment  in 1971 
(1,2). 
 
Advances in surgical technique and post- operative care have significantly decreased morbidity 
and mortality following the Fontan operation; however, prolonged pleural drainage remains  one 
of the most serious complications associated with considerable morbidity and signifi cant 
resource utilization. Pleural effusions after the Fontan operation increase risk of infection, 
prolong hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and may necessitate a pleurodesis procedure. 
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 6 of 26  Revised: 05/23/16   
 
 
The presence of significant prolonged pleural effusions after the Fontan operati on has been 
reported to occur in up to 45% of patients (3). Fu et al. reported results from a retrospect ive study 
of [ADDRESS_469386]-operative persistent pleural effusion lasting more than 15 days in 38.9 % of the patients  (37 
out of 95). The median length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208141] [ADDRESS_469387]-operative infections w ere 
independent risks factors for prolonged pleural drainage. Long cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CBP) 
time, non-fenestration, small conduit size, and low pre- operative saturation were independent 
risk factors for excessive volume of pleural drainage (>25ml/kg/day) (4). 
 
Another retrospective report of 100 extracardiac Fontan procedures showed that 37% ha d pleural 
drainage lasting greater than two weeks, and this was associated with lower pre-op erative oxygen 
saturations, prolonged cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] (CPB) time, post- operative infection and smaller 
conduit size (5). In addition, results from the multicenter, Single Ventricle Re construction Trial 
found that 18% of the patients had pleural drainage that persisted for more than 7 days (6). 
 
Factors found to be related to reduced pleural effusions and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] i n some 
studies were the creation of a fenestration, partial exclusion of the hepatic  veins during 
completion of the Fontan procedure, and an extracardiac Fontan operation (7, 8). However, as 
noted above, despi[INVESTIGATOR_374949], there are still a significant number of pati ents with 
prolonged pleural effusions. 
 
One potential medical intervention to address the above stated problem is the use of vasopr essin. 
Vasopressin may target several mechanisms that lead to prolonged chest tube drainag e. It acts on 
the cardiovascular system by [CONTACT_374975]. This decreas es the 
hydrostatic pressure transmitted to the capi[INVESTIGATOR_374950] e xtravasation of 
fluid. This vasoconstriction also improves blood pressure without the need for further fluid 
administration. Perhaps more importantly, vasopressin decreases capi[INVESTIGATOR_374951]. These results were also seen in an ovine induce d severe 
sepsis model when vasopressin and selective V1a-agonistPhe2- Orn8 -Vasotocin (POV) analog 
were found to attenuate vascular dysfunction and fluid accumulation. Alveolar neutrophil  
migration and plasma levels of nitric oxide were reduced, resulting in higher mean art erial 
pressures and reduced vascular leakage in the treated group as compared to controls  (9). 
Vasopressin in states of vasodilatory shock at doses ranging from 0.1-8 mU/kg/min has been 
reported. At this dose range, vasopressin increased the mean arterial pressure, pr omoted diuresis 
and decreased vasopressors requirements (10, 11, 12) 
 
Data on vasopressin use in children is sparse, but growing. In a retrospective study, Jerath e t al. 
evaluated the clinical impact of vasopressin infusion on hemodynamics, liver and renal  function 
in pediatric patients. A total of 117 patients, of which 85 were cardiac, received vasopres sin for 
vasodilatory shock. The median dose of vasopressin was 0.1mU/kg/min for cardiac patients a nd 
0.2 mU/kg/min in non-cardiac patients. The median infusion time was 24 hours in cardiac 
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 7 of 26  Revised: 05/23/16   
 
 
patients and 18 hours in non-cardiac patients. Both cardiac and non- cardiac patients showed a 
significant decrease in inotrope requirement, without any change in central venous satur ation or 
lactate during infusion. Higher doses of vasopressin were associated with increased urea and 
creatinine and decreased urine output in both groups, but these effects were reversible  (13). 
 
Rosenzweig et al. reported the outcomes of vasopressin use at a dose of 0.3 to 2 mU/kg/min in 
11critically ill infants and children (age 3 days to 15 years; median 35 days) with vasodil atory 
shock after cardiac surgery. Three of the patients had single ventricle physiology. The  mean 
duration of therapy was 71 ±46 hours (range 6-144 hours). Vasopressin was initiated 
immediately after CPB in [ADDRESS_469388]-operative day. The use of other inotropes declined significantly in 9 
patients and remained unchanged in the other two. All 9 children with vasodilatory shock 
survived their intensive care unit stay. The 2 patients who received AVP in the setti ng of poor 
cardiac function died, despi[INVESTIGATOR_374952]. Urine output, perfusi on 
and electrolytes remained unchanged. There were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_374953] (14). 
 
Lechner et al. reported a retrospective study on the effects of vasopressin treat ment in neonates 
with catecholamine -resistant systemic vasodilatation after cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. They 
evaluated 172 neonates who underwent open-heart surgery of which 17 developed vasopressor- 
resistant hypotension and were treated with vasopressin. Thirteen of these had Sta ge 1 palliation 
of a single ventricle (Norwood procedure), two underwent the Ross procedure, and two had t he 
arterial switch operation. All patients received multiple inotropes and vasop ressors prior to 
vasopressin administration. Vasopressin was administered at a dose of 0.1 mU/kg/m in to a 
maximum of 0.3 mU/kg/min. The use of vasopressin resulted in a significant increase in blood 
pressure and decreased other vasopressors requirement. No peripheral vasoconstr iction or 
ischemic lesions were observed (15).  
 
In a retrospective study, Alten et al. reported use of a low dose vasopressin infusion ini tiated in 
the operating room in neonates following the Norwood procedure or arterial switch operati on. 
Nineteen patients that received low dose vasopressin (0.3 mU/kg/min) were compared t o [ADDRESS_469389] 24 hours 
and median maximum inotrope score was lower in the vasopressin group compared to the control 
group. The vasopressin group reached median net negative cumulative fluid balance sooner (55 
hours vs. 76 hours) when compared to the group that did not receive vasopressin (16). 
 
In the specific population we plan to study, Kumar reported the results of 62 consecutive pat ients 
who underwent the Fontan operation. Forty patients who received vasopressin at a dose of 0.3- 
0.5mU/kg/min as part of the perioperative management following Fontan operation were 
compared to [ADDRESS_469390] tube output and duration were significantl y 
decreased in the group that received vasopressin with a median of 22 ml/kg versus 68 ml/kg. The 
median duration of chest tube drainage was 6 days less in the group that received vasopressi n.

Median hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374954] 16 to 9 days (17). This was a retrospective  
study, but the results were dramatic and not readily explained by [CONTACT_374976] e. 
 
Vasopressin use after the Fontan surgery is a promising intervention. A retrospect ive analysis 
showed dramatic reduction in length of stay and pleural drainage. A prospective, multic enter 
randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm these findings and make this treatme nt strategy 
available to the high risk children with congenital heart disease undergoing this surger y.

10) Procedures  Involved 
 
Design  
The study is designed as a randomized, double blinded placebo control clinical trial to 
evaluate the use of vasopressin following the Fontan operation. The study will consist of 
two phases: 
 
Phase 1 will be a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_374956]’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Oak Lawn IL. Ten patients will be enrolled and randomized in double blind 
fashion with five patients as control group and five receiving vasopressin. The same 
protocol will be used for both phases of the study. For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_374957]-operative day 1. 
Electrolytes and albumin level will be monitored with complete metabolic panel (CMP) 
which will be obtained prior to surgery, on post-operative Day [ADDRESS_469393] of a multicenter study conducted in the cardiac operating rooms and 
cardiac intensive care unit (CVICU) of 7 pediatric cardiovascular programs in the United 
States. We will enroll 12 subjects undergoing the Fontan operation from each participat ing 
institution and randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. Six patients will be randomly 
assigned to receive vasopressin while six will receive placebo.  
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 11 of 26  Revised: 05/23/16   
 
 
 
 
Sample:  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  
A total of 10 patients undergoing the Fontan procedure will be included and randomized to 
one of the two treatment groups. 
 
Group 1 will include 5 subjects who will receive vasopressin for 48 hours following the 
Fontan operation. Group 2 will include 5 subjects who will receive placebo (normal saline ) 
and will serve as a control group. 
 
Multicenter Trial  
A total of 84 patients undergoing the Fontan operation will be included in the study and 
randomized to one of the two treatment groups. 
 
Group 1 will include 42 subjects who will receive the treatment drug (vasopressin) f or 48 
hours following the Fontan operation. Group 2 will include 42 subjects who will receive 
placebo (normal saline) and will serve as a control group. 
 
 
Drug administration protocol 
For subjects in the experimental group, vasopressin at a dose of 0.3 mU/kg/min will be 
started while coming off cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476]. The dose of vasopressin will be titr ated 
in the CVICU to a maximum of 0.5 mU/kg/min according to clinical assessment. The drip 
will eventually be titrated down to 0.3 mU/kg/min for at least 2 hours and from that dose 
will be discontinued 48 hours after arrival in the CVICU. 
 
Subjects in the placebo group will receive normal saline which will be titrated a ccording to 
clinical assessment at the same ‘dose’ of the vasopressin group. The treating physician will 
be blinded. 
 
All other clinical interventions will be at the discretion of the treating physician at eac h 
participating institution. For the multicenter trial each site is to provide their usual s tandard 
of care. The standard care at each site will be described prior to initiation of the  Phase 2 
study and deviations from this will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_98455].

strategy and this will remain consistent throughout the study. If deviation from normal 
treatment occurs, these will be reported. This will allow a variety of treatment stra tegies 
with vasopressin as the only difference in each center.

12) Data  Management  
 
Sample Size Estimation  
Sample size estimation for the Phase [ADDRESS_469395] tube in days (17). We used a more conservative difference between groups than that  
previously reported to accommodate the anticipated non-normal data and allow us to 
control for possible variation among clinical sites. Group sample sizes of 42 (study group)  
and 42 (control group) achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal means 
when the population mean difference is 1.[ADDRESS_469396]. 
After the collection of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (n=10), a power calculation will be 
conducted and a revised sample size estimation will be tested to confirm the estimate d 
sample of 84 for the multi- site clinical trial.  
 
Data management and storage  
All information gathered during this study will be kept confidential. Study data will be 
managed using REDCap18 electronic data capture tools hosted by [CONTACT_374981]. REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application  
designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface  for 
validated data entry; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures;  3) 
automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical  packages; 
and 4) procedures for importing data from external sources. The data will be accessi ble to 
only the study investigators and REDCap administrators. Subjects will be assigned case  
numbers. Data being extracted from the REDCap database will include only the case 
numbers and be de-identified via the electronic removal of PHI prior to data download. 
After data collection is complete and records have been verified, identifiers w ill be 
permanently removed from the data set.  
 
Data access will be grouped according to site so that each site will only have access  to their 
data. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_374961].  
 
Data analysis  
Data analysis will include descriptive statistics of all variables of interest for ea ch group to 
examine data for normality and statistical assumptions. Descriptive statistics will als o be 
used to test for differences between clinical sites. Appropriate inferential s tatistics (e.g. 
independent t-test or Mann Whitney U) will be used to test for differences between gr oups 
for chest tube duration, output and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. Statistical tests will be 
performed as two -sided tests and will be adjusted to the multi -centric design of the study. If 
differences are detected between clinical sites, analysis of covariance will be used  to

control for the clinical site. A 2 -tailed significance level of p<0.[ADDRESS_469397] log with case numbers and patient names will be maintained in a locked cabinet a t 
each study site. No PHI will be stored in the electronic REDCap database and all d ata 
extracted from the file will be de -identified. The data will be accessible to only the study 
investigators and REDCap administrators. . 
 
13) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
Monitoring Plan 
The individual responsible for data safety and monitoring will be [CONTACT_374994] (principa l 
investigator - PI). Quality control will include regular data verification and prot ocol 
compliance checks by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jamie Penk. In order to ensure trials at other sites are c onducting 
appropriately monthly phone calls will be conducted. 
 
Collection and reporting of SAEs and AEs  
Throughout the study, each site investigator will monitor study participants for adverse 
events. [CONTACT_374995] will review all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse event s (SAEs) 
individually and in aggregate on a biweekly basis until the end of the study trial (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954]). Adverse events still ongoing after study drug discontinuation will be follow ed 
until [ADDRESS_469398] AE definitions will be used: 
 
Adverse event: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease, that did not exist at the time of the 
subject’s entry into the study and that is temporally associated with the use of the 
study medication, regardless of whether it is considered related to the study 
medication.  
The following risks have been reported during the infusion of Vasopressin. These 
risks will be monitored individually through a review of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374962] a 
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 17 of 26  Revised: 05/23/[ADDRESS_469399], if indicated. Adverse 
events will be reported in aggregate within the IND application annual report. 
• Hyponatremia ( sodium level less than 130mEq/L) 
• Vomiting (recorded at number of times per day, pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103]) 
• Decreased platelet count (less than  50,000) 
• Limb  necrosis  
• Grade one acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.[ADDRESS_469400] 
>0.3mg/dl) 
 
Suspected adverse reaction: A suspected adverse reaction means any adverse 
event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than an adverse reaction. 
Adverse Reaction: An adverse reaction means any adverse event caused by a 
drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions where 
there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “unexpected” if it is not consistent with the risk information described 
in this plan. 
The following risks are examples of unexpected adverse events suspected to be related to 
the study drug that would require reporting in this study. 
• Extended Ventilatory support (Positive Pressure Ventilation > [ADDRESS_469401]- 
operative)  
• Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support 
 
Serious Adverse Event: An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of the Sponsor-Investigator it results in any of 
the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life threatening adverse  event  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical 
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 18 of 26  Revised: 05/23/[ADDRESS_469402] is in the trial (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7947]). AEs will be assessed through a review of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374962] a weekly basis a nd 
with a physical examination of the subject, if indicated. 
 
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Events determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_374963] 5 days per HRP 213. Adverse events that 
are determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_374964]. 
 
An IND safety report will be reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_374965], serious and unexpected . All FDA 
reporting will be consistent with 21 CFR 312.32 (c). 
• Unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions will be reported to FDA as  soon 
as possible but no later than within 15 calendar days following the Sponsor- 
Investigator initial receipt of the  information. 
• Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions will be  reported 
to FDA as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days following the 
Sponsor- Investigator initial receipt of the  information. 
 
AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_374982]: 
Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. This includes 
transient laboratory test alterations.  
Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities. This includes laboratory test alterations 
indicating injury, but without long- term risk.  
Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. If 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374966]. (An AE that is severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity 
is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as mild, moderate or  severe.)  
The study will use the following AE attribution scale : 
Unrelated: The AE is clearly related to other factors such as the subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered 
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 19 of 26  Revised: 05/23/[ADDRESS_469403] (i.e., another cause of the event is most plausible and/or a 
clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the 
event).  
Not likely related: The event was most likely produced by [CONTACT_374983]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or 
concomitant drugs administered to the subject, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug. 
Possibly related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to 
the study drug; but it could have been produced by [CONTACT_11259]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs 
administered to the  subject. 
Probably related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration and follows a known response 
pattern to the study drug; and it cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_374984]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or 
concomitant drugs administered to the subject. 
Vasopressin treatment discontinuation due to adverse events.  
Vasopressin treatment will be stopped if any of the following occur: 
• Evidence of renal injury after surgery defined by [CONTACT_374985] > 1.5mg/dL through the second post-operative 
day. 
• Prolonged need for positive pressure ventilation greater than 4 days 
• Subjects that require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support 
 
Data Analysis Plans and Interim Reports 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform a statistical r eview of 
the study data and will have access to fully patient data if necessary, to ensure patient 
safety. The DSMB will be comprised of [ADDRESS_469404] will function independently of the investigators. The following data will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_374986]* manner: 
Number and type of adverse events and serious adverse events in each group 
Primary Endpoints: 
• Chest tube output quantity in cc/kg  
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 20 of 26  Revised: 05/23/16   
 
 
• Duration that chest tubes remain in place (remove when less than  2cc/kg/day). 
Secondary  Endpoints: 
• Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• Mortality  
 
The DSMB will review data at the end of the single site pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=10) and during the 
multi -site study after enrollment of [ADDRESS_469405] been enrolled. 
*The randomization code will be kept strictly confidential. This code will be provided to 
the DSMB by [CONTACT_374987]. 
 
The DSMB will prepare and submit a report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_374967]. This re port will be 
submitted to the IRB and FDA at continuing review and annual review. 
 
14) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects that meet any of the following criteria will be withdrawn from the study: 
 
• Evidence of renal injury after surgery defined by: 
o Doubling creatinine level from baseline AND  
o Absolute creatinine level >1.5 ml/dL 
 
• Prolonged positive pressure ventilation greater than [ADDRESS_469406] operatively  
 
• Use of open label  vasopressin 
 
• Subjects that require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support 
 
 
When subjects are withdrawn, we will continue to collect the same data as described above. 
This will allow for an ‘intention to treat’ analysis.  
 
 
15) Risks to  Subjects  
Risks to the patients involved in this study are related to adverse effects of the vas opressin. 
Vasopressin risks are dose dependent and in this study we will be using low dose of this 
medication. Major side effects from vasopressin include but are not limited to 
hyponatremia, limb ischemia, localized blanching, peripheral vasoconstriction, water  
Ver1_Revised 11-29-16  
HRP -503 Template Protocol  Page 21 of 26  Revised: 05/23/16   
 
 
intoxication, mesenteric ischemia, nausea, vomiting, decreased platelets count, re nal 
insufficiency. 
 
Off label vasopressin has been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal hemorr hage, 
vasodilatory shock, following complex heart surgery (Norwood, arterial switch operati on), 
refractory, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. A retrospective study 
reported the use of vasopressin following the Fontan operation at a dose of 0.3- 
0.5mU/kg/min with no significant side effects. 
 
All subjects in this study will be monitored in the ICU after surgery and monitored for  
adverse events as described in section 13. Appropriate medical care will be provi ded for 
any adverse events.  
 
16) Potential Benefits to  Subjects  
 
There are no guaranteed benefits to any subjects in this study. The results of this study will 
be used to evaluate the potential benefits of vasopressin in reducing pleural effusions 
following the Fontan operation. Subjects in the treatment group may benefit from 
decreased pleural effusions and a shorter length of stay if the hypothesis is correct.  
 
17) Vulnerable  Populations  
This research involves children as a vulnerable population. With that in mind, we have 
reviewed Checklist HRP -416 and feel that this study meets the criteria for research 
involving children under 21 CFR §50.51/45 CFR §46.404; 
 
Utilization of vasopressin in children and side effects are described in section 15. Be ing in 
this study would put the children at no greater risk than other children where this 
medication has been used previously. 
 
All subjects in this study will be monitored in the ICU after surgery and monitored for  
adverse events as described in section 13.  
 
18) Multi -Site Research  
This study will be performed at 7 different pediatric cardiovascular programs in the  United 
States. The participating institutions sites are Advocate Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374968], IL;

the consent (principal investigator, sub investigator, advanced cardiovascular nurse 
practitioner). Approximately [ADDRESS_469408] sufficient time to decide whether to enroll  or not. 
All questions will be answered prior to obtaining consent. 
 
Non-English Speaking Subjects 
There is a potential that a patient with Spanish speaking parents will be invited to 
participate in this study. In this case, the Spanish short form will be used for consent wi th 
the English consent presented orally in Spanish with the assistance of an interpreter . 
 
Subjects who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers) 
All subjects involved in the study are < [ADDRESS_469409] one parent before any study procedures are performed, though both parents 
will be encouraged to discuss the child’s participation. 
 
 
32) Process to Document Consent in Writing  
We will be following procedures outlined in SOP HRP-091. The consent for the research 
study will be documented together with the consent for surgery as a note in the medical 
record of the patient.

TITLE:  A Randomized, Active-Controlled  Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety o f 
Intravenous Sulbactam-ETX2514 in the Treatment of Patients With  Infections Caused by 
[CONTACT_303238]-calcoaceticus Complex 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  CS2514-2017-[ADDRESS_370198]:  Sulbactam-ETX2514 (ETX2514SUL) 
PHASE:  3 
INDICATION(S):  Treatment of serious infections caused by [CONTACT_303238]
(A. baumannii) -calcoaceticus complex (ABC) 
OBJECTIVES: 
This is a 2-part study, with Part A being the randomized, contr olled portion of the study in patients 
with ABC hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP), ventilator-associated bacterial 
pneumonia (VABP), ventilated pne umonia (VP), or bacteremia. Par t B is the single-group portion 
of the study and includes ABC infections that are resistant to or have failed colistin or polymyxin B 
treatment, as detailed in the inclusion criteria. 
The primary objectives of this  study are the following: 
 To compare the efficacy of ETX 2514SUL plus imipenem/cilastatin to colistin plus 
imipenem/cilastatin in patients with carbapenem-resistant ABC ( CRABC) infections in Part A; 
and 
 To compare the incidence of nephrotoxicity, as measured by [CONTACT_303241]–Injury–Failure–Loss–
End-stage renal disease (RIFLE) criteria, of ETX2514SUL to coli stin in patients with ABC 
infections in Part A. 
The secondary objectives of thi s study are the following: 
 To compare the efficacy of ETX 2514SUL plus imipenem/cilastatin to colistin plus 
imipenem/cilastatin in all randomized patients in Part A; 
 To evaluate the efficacy of ETX2514S UL plus imipenem/cilastatin  in patients with colistin- or 
polymyxin B-resistant ABC infections in Part B;  
 To estimate the efficacy of ETX2514SUL plus imip enem/cilastatin for each primary infection 
site;  
 To evaluate and compare the s afety of ETX2514SUL and colistin; 
 To describe the overall safet y profile of ETX2514SUL; and 
 To determine the systemic exposure of ETX2514 and sulbactam in a small cohort of severely 
ill patients administered ETX2514SUL in Part A.

Patients will be enrolled until there are 120 patients in the C RABC Microbiologically Modified 
Intent-to-Treat (m-MITT) Population in Part A, as determined by  [CONTACT_303246]. Approximately 200 patients are expected to be enrol led in Part A, assuming 
approximately 60% of patients will have CRABC (see the statisti cal methods for complete

if the reason for disconti nuation is clinical failure. 
In Part A, clinical outcome asse ssments will be performed by a blinded assessor, in addition to the 
unblinded Investigator. Whenever possible, the same blinded assessor should comple te all clinical 
outcome assessments for a study pa tient. If there is a discrepancy between the assessment of the
blinded assessor and unblinded Investigator, the assessment fro m the blinded assessor will be used. 
If there is a missing assessment from either the blinded assessor or unblinded Investigator, the 
other available assessment will be used. An adjudication committee may be organized for endpoint 
adjudication should it be deemed necessary as determined by [CONTACT_303250] (DSMB). In such a case, a charter will be developed that describes their activities. 
Intense PK sampling will be performed on the first approximatel y 30 patients randomized in 
Part A. The purpose of the intense PK sampling is to ensure tha t exposures observed in this severely 
ill cohort are comparable to those observed thus far in prior c linical studies. The PK samples will 
be collected for both treatment groups in Part A to keep the study data blinded. Pharmacokinetic 
assessment of the initial 15 patients on ETX2514SUL in Part A w ill be performed b y a n

Outcome Definitions: 
Clinical Outcome: 
Clinical outcome will be used to determine a response of clinic al success for all patients. Based on 
the assessment of signs and symp toms, the unblinded Investigato r will choose 1 of the following 
clinical outcomes at the Day 5, Day 7, EOT Visit, TOC Visit, LF U Visit, and ET Visit, i f 
applicable. In Part A, in addition to the unblinded Investigato r, a blinded assessor will also 
determine clinical outcome. If t here is a discrepancy between t he assessment of the blinded 
assessor and unblinded Investigat or, the assessment from the blinded assessor will be used. If there 
is a missing assessment from either the blinded assessor or unblinded Investigator, the other 
available assessment will be used. An adjudication committee ma y be organized for endpoint 
adjudication should it be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_4318]. In such  a  c a s e ,  a  c h a r t e r  w i l l  b e  
developed that describe s their activities. 
Clinical cure: complete resoluti on or significant improvement o f signs and symptoms that were 
present at baseline and no new symptoms, such that no additiona l Gram negative antimicrobial 
therapy is warranted. Clinical failure: symptoms present at study entry have not significantly improved or completely 
resolved, or new symptoms have developed and require the initia tion of a non-study Gram negative 
antibacterial drug therapy, death, or intolerance to study drug  leading to discontinuation from the 
study treatment. Clinical indeterminate: determin ation cannot be made because of  missing data or the patient is lost 
to follow-up.

Version 4.0, 17 December 2020 19Microbiologic Outcome: 
Microbiologic outcome for bacter emia, complicated urinary tract  infection, or acute 
pyelonephritis: 
For patients with bacteremia, cUTI, or AP, per-patient microbio logical response will be determined 
programmatically as 1 of the following outcomes based on the re sults of blood and/or urine cultures 
at the Day 5, Day 7, EOT, TOC, and LFU Visits. A microbiological favorable assessment will 
include eradication and presumed  eradications, as detailed belo w. 
Microbiologic eradication: 
 For patients with cUTI or AP: the baseline strain of ABC is red uced to <103 colony-forming 
units (CFU)/mL on urine culture a nd negative on repeat blood cu lture (if positive at baseline);
or 
 For patients with bacteremia: ab sence of the baseline strain of  ABC on culture. 
Microbiologic presumed eradication:  no culture was done, and the patient meets clinical criteria 
for clinical cure. 
Microbiologic persistence: 
 For patients with cUTI or AP: the demonstration that the urine culture grew 103 CFU/mL o f 
the baseline strain of ABC identified at study entry and/or a blood culture demonstrates the 
same baseline pathogen(s); or 
 For patients with bacteremia: pr esence of the baseline strain o f ABC on repeat culture. 
Patients who are a persistence at EOT will be considered a pers istence at TOC. 
Microbiologic presumed persistence:  no culture was done, and the patient meets clinical criteria 
for clinical failure. 
Microbiologic indeterminate:  if clinically indicated (for cU TI and bacteremia only), no fol low-up 
culture is available, the culture cannot be interpreted for any  reason, or the culture is considered 
contaminated.  Microbiologic recurrence:   
 For patients with cUTI or AP: the demonstration that the urine culture grew 10
3 CFU/mL o f 
the baseline strain of ABC identified at study entry at any tim e after documented eradication at 
the TOC Visit up to and including the LFU Visit; or  
 For patients with bacteremia: a positive blood culture for ABC at any time after documented 
eradication at the TOC Visit  up to and including the LFU Visit.  
Microbiologic outcome for hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired bacterial pneumonia , ventilator-associated bacterial 
pneumonia, ventilated pneumonia, o r surgical or post-traumatic wound infections: 
Microbiologic presumed eradication:  no culture was done, and the patient meets clinical criteria 
for clinical cure. For patients with HABP/VABP/VP or surgical o r post-traumatic wound 
infections, where repeat culture samples may not be indicated, presumed eradication based on 
clinical improvement  will be inferred.

SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety parameters include the incidence, severity, causality, and seriousness o f 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and adverse events of  special interest, including 
nephrotoxicity as measured by [CONTACT_303251], and the evaluatio n of changes from baseline in 
safety laboratory test results , electrocardiograms (ECGs), vita l signs, physical examinations, and 
chest X-ray/radiology/ultrasound and mechanical ventilator asse ssments for patients with HABP, 
VABP, or VP. Newly emergent infections that appear after baseli ne will be reported as adverse 
events and summarized separately. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: This study is designed to estim ate treatment efficacy of ABC infections with a p ivotal component 
in Part A.  Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of non -missing observations, 
arithmetic mean, standard deviati on, median, minimum, and maxim um values as descriptive 
statistics. Categorical variables  will be summarized by [CONTACT_303252] c ategory as descriptive statisti cs.  
All comparisons in Part A will be for ETX2514SUL plus imipenem/ cilastatin versus colistin plus 
imipenem/cilastatin. The efficacy endpoints for Part B will be summarized descriptively only and 
will be used to supplement results  in Part A. Listings of indiv idual patient data will be produced. 
The ITT Population will include  all patients randomized to stud y drug treatment (ETX2514SUL 
plus imipenem/cilastatin or colistin plus imipenem/cilastatin) in Part A or enrolled in Part B, 
regardless of whether the patien t actually receives study drug.  
The Modified ITT (MITT) Population will include patients in Par ts A and B who meet ITT criteria 
and receive any amount of study drug. The MITT Population will be considered the Safety 
Population. Patients with HABP/VA BP/VP who were r andomized to P art A on the basis of a BPP 
rapid test result but were subsequently withdrawn due to a lack  of a culture growing ABC will be 
counted in the MITT and Safety Populations.  The m-MITT Population will include patients who meet MITT crite ria and have an ABC organism 
isolated as the qualifying cu lture specimen, as confirmed by [CONTACT_303253]/or local microbiology 
laboratory. If an isolate for test ing at the central laboratory  is not available, the local laboratory 
data can be used to confirm the presence of ABC organism, as lo ng as the local laboratory uses 
modern methods of diagnosis such as molecular-based tests, matr ix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time-of-f light mass spectrometry, Vitek, Phoenix, etc (ie, not conventional 
biochemical or manual phenotypic methods). Patients with HABP/V ABP/VP who are enrolled 
based upon a positive BPP rapid test for ABC, but subsequently are found to have respi[INVESTIGATOR_303178] (by [CONTACT_12082]),  will be withdrawn from the study
drug treatment. These patients wi ll not be included in the m-MI TT Population but will remain in 
the MITT Population. The CRABC m-MITT Population will i nclude patients who meet m-MI TT criteria and 
have a baseline ABC organism that is confirmed to be carbapenem -resistant (MIC to 
imipenem/meropenem 8 mg/L) by [CONTACT_303254]2514-2017-0004

evidence of non-susceptibilit y to colistin and ETX2514SUL at ba seline. 
The CE Population will include pa tients who meet m-MITT criteri a and meet evaluability criteria 
(meet key inclusion criteria, do  not have key exclusion criteria, received at lea st 72 hours of study 
drug [ie, 12 doses of ETX2514SUL plus 12 doses of imipenem/cila statin or 6 doses of colistin plus 
12 doses of imipenem/cilastatin in patients without dose adjust ments] to be a clinical cure, received 
at least 48 hours of study drug [ie, 8 doses of ETX2514SUL plus  8 doses of imipenem/cilastatin or 
4 doses of colistin plus 8 doses  of imipenem/cilastatin in pati ents without dose adjustments] to be 
a clinical failure, received 80% of anticipated doses, and di d not have a clinical response of 
indeterminate at the TOC Visit). 
The ME Population will include patients who meet m-MITT criteri a and CE criteria and have an 
appropriately collected culture s pecimen and interpretable culture result when specimen collection 
is clinically indicated at the TOC Visit. The CRABC ME Population will incl ude patients who meet ME crite ria and who have a baseline 
ABC organism that is confirmed t o be carbapenem-resistant (and susceptible to ETX2514SUL for 
Parts A and B and susceptib le to colistin for Part A). 
The PK Population will include patients who receive any amount of study drug and have evaluable
PK data. Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is 28-day all-cause  mortality in the CRABC m-MITT 
Population in Part A. Patients in the CRABC m-MITT Population who discontinue study drug 
prematurely in Part A for any r eason will be included in the assessment of 28-day all-cause 
mortality, provided consent  has not been withdrawn.  
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will b e performed for patients whose 
eligible culture is >[ADDRESS_370216] dose of study drug , as well as for all patients with and 
without evidence of non-suscepti bility to colistin and ETX2514S UL at baseline. 
The non-inferiority assessment will be based on the 2-sided 95%  confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
difference ([ETX2514SUL + imipene m/cilastatin] – [colistin + im ipenem/cilastatin]) in 28-day 
all-cause mortality rates between the treatment groups. Non-inf eriority will be concluded if the 
upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI is less than +20%.  If non-inferiority is achieved, a test of superiority will be p erformed. 
The analysis of the primary ef ficacy endpoint 28-day all-cause mortality will also be performed in 
the ITT Population. The number and percentage of patients in each response category  for the secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be summarized b

Version 4.0, 17 December 2020 331 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
There is a significant unmet medical need to identify new agent s to treat Acinetobacter baumannii 
(A. baumannii) -calcoaceticus  complex (ABC) infections. Sulbactam-ETX2514 (ETX2514SUL) 
is a novel bactericidal β-lactam (BL)/β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) combination, which is being 
developed for the treatment of infections caused by [CONTACT_55642], includ ing multi-drug resistant (MDR) 
and carbapenem-resistant ABC (CRABC) isolates. 
Acinetobacter baumannii , a non-fermenting Gram negative bacterial species, is increasi ngly being 
recognized as an important cause  of severe infections, particul arly in compromised hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219369]. It is a significant  public health concern and is clas sified as a “serious  threat” pathogen in 
the recent [LOCATION_002] (US) Centers for Disease Control and P revention “Antibiotic Resistance 
Threats in the [LOCATION_002]” report1 and is ranked as “critical” on the World Health Organization 
(WHO) global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to guide research, discovery, and 
development of new antibiotics.2 Acinetobacter baumannii causes severe infections that are 
associated with high mortality. Approximately 2% of healthcare- associated infections are caused 
by A. baumannii .[ADDRESS_370235] proportion of infections caused by A. baumannii . Serious infections caused by 
A. baumannii , including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired ba cterial pneumonia (HABP)/ventil ator-associated 
bacterial pneumonia (VABP), vent ilated pneumonia (VP), complica ted urinary tract 
infection (cUTI), bacteremia, a nd wound infections, are estimat ed to occur in 70,000 patients to 
90,000 patients in the [LOCATION_002] per year, of which approximately 63% are caused by [CONTACT_303259].4 Multi-drug resistance in A. baumannii is an evolving problem, with some countries in 
Europe reporting carbapenem resistance rates >50%.5 Mortality associated with bacteremia and 
pneumonia caused by A. baumannii  ranges from 30% to 50%.6,[ADDRESS_370236] but phenot ypi[INVESTIGATOR_303182] m A. baumannii  also cause human 
disease. Therefore, this group is referred to as the “ Acinetobacter baumann ii-calcoaceticus 
complex”.8 
In the early 1960s to 1970s, infections due to A. baumannii  were managed effectively with BL 
antibiotics, as the rates of resi stance to available antimicrobial classes were low.9,10 However, by 
[CONTACT_2671] 1970s, resistance to aminoglycosides and BL anti biotics had been reported. In the 
1980s, carbapenems such as imipenem became the drug of choice f or treatment of A. baumannii  
infections; widespread carbapene m resistance, however, has now been observed in many 
countries.1,[ADDRESS_370237] 3 or more antimicro bial categories, and many are 
extremely drug resistant (XDR), defined as non-susceptibility to at least 1 agent in all but 2 or fewer antimicrobial categories.
11 For example, data from the Healthcare Safety Network 
summarizing healthcare-associated infections reported that appr oximately 60% to 70% of 
A. baumannii  isolates causing pneumonia or b acteremia were resistant to car bapenems and were 
identified as MDR.3

Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_370238] in a small numbe r of countries (eg, Combactam™, 
[LOCATION_013]), the vast majority of human use is in combination with  BL (eg, Unasyn™, 
ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/sulbactam). Unas yn is approved by [CONTACT_303260], Europe, 
and the Asia-Pacific region. 
Entasis Therapeutics is devel opi[INVESTIGATOR_303183]2514SUL for the treatment  of serious infections caused 
by A. baumannii . The dose of sulbactam, 1 g on ce every 6 hours (q6h) (maximum daily dose in 
patients with normal renal clearance of 4 g), that will be used  in combination with ETX2514 is the 
highest dose approved for human use. 
1.1 Nonclinical Experience With ETX2514 
Nonclinical data are provided i n more detail in the Investigato r’s Brochure. 
The nonclinical safety program f or ETX2514 includes toxicology studies up to 14 days duration 
in rats and dogs, safety pharm acology, and genetic toxicity. Th ese studies demonstrate that 
ETX2514 was generally well tolerated and was not associated wit h target organ toxicity when 
administered in doses up to 2000 mg/kg. ETX2514 did not exhibit  high protein binding, and in 
vitro data did not indicate significant drug-drug interactions via cytochrome P450 pathways or 
interactions with hepatic or re nal transporters. ETX2514 was la rgely excreted unchanged in the 
urine. Reproductive toxicology s tudies are currently ongoing. 
1.2 Clinical Experience With ETX2514 
A summary of clinical experience is provided in greater detail in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
ETX2514 has been evaluated both alone and in combination with s ulbactam and/or 
imipenem/cilastatin in a Phase [ADDRESS_370239]-in-human study. This stu dy evaluated single ascending doses 
and multiple ascending doses of ETX2514 to fully characterize t he safety and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) profile of ETX2514. In addition, this study evaluated if t here was any clinically significant 
drug-drug interacti on between sulbactam, ETX2514, and imipenem/ cilastatin. 
Additionally, a Phase 1 study evaluated lung penetration by [CONTACT_303261] 2514 and sulbactam in 30 healthy 
volunteers. Administration of single doses of ETX2514SUL was al so studied in patients with mild, 
moderate, or severe renal insufficiency, as well as in hemodial ysis patients.  
A Phase 2 study in patients with cUTI or acute pyelonephritis ( AP) has been completed. The 
primary objective of t his study was to assess the safety of ETX 2514SUL in moderately ill 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. Study CS2514-2514-2017-0003 was conducte d at 20 sites in 4 countries 
(Belarus, Bulgaria, Russia, and Ukraine). This study was a double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  intravenous (IV) ETX2514SUL in 
patients with cUTIs or AP who were otherwise relatively healthy . Patients providing informed 
consent 
and meeting all study eligibility criteria were enrolle d and had a pretreatment urine and 
blood sample obtained and submitte d to the local laboratory. Ei ghty patients were randomized in

Version 4.0, 17 December 2020 35a 2:1 ratio (53 patients rando mized into the ETX2514SUL group a nd 27 patients randomized into 
the placebo group) to receive either 1 g ETX2514/1 g sulbactam IV (infused over 3 hours) or 
matching placebo q6h, respectivel y. All patients received backg round therapy with 
500 mg/500 mg IV imipenem/cilastat in q6h (infused over 30 minut es). Therapy was continued for 
[ADDRESS_370240] udies are summarized below: 
 ETX2514 demonstrated linear PK a nd had no evidence of accumulat ion. 
 ETX2514 did not interact with sulbact am and/or imip enem/cilasta tin. 
 ETX2514 was predominantly excreted  renally and dose adjustments  were necessary for 
patients with moderate or severe  renal insufficiency including dialysis. Similarly, higher doses 
are recommended for patients with  augmented renal clearance or receiving continuous renal 
replacement therapy. 
 ETX2514SUL demonstrated good penetra tion of the lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] . 
Efficacy results: 
 ETX2514SUL when dosed with imipene m/cilastatin showed comparabl e efficacy to 
placebo + imipenem/cilastatin in treatment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_303184]. Among 
patients with imipenem nonsusceptible infections, imipenem comb ined with ETX2514SUL 
was able to successfully treat 3 out of 3 infections. 
Safety and tolerability results: 
 ETX2514 was generally safe and well tolerated when given alone or with sulbactam and/or 
imipenem/cilastatin. 
 To date, there have been no seri ous adverse drug reactions or deaths in clinical studies. 
 The most common adverse events reported were headache and infus ion site reactions, 
including phlebitis and vascula r pain at the infusion site. 
 Mild reductions in total white blood cell (WBC) and absolute ne utrophil counts have been 
observed with multiple doses of ETX2514, although no events of leukopenia or neutropenia 
have been observed. 
 Asymptomatic, transient increases in hepatic enzymes (unaccompa nied by [CONTACT_303262]) have been observed with ETX2514SUL, and these are th ought to be related to known 
effects of sulbactam. 
 Mild to moderate allergic reactions including urticaria have be en observed at rates <1% with 
ETX2514SUL. 
 No clinically significant change s in vital signs or electrocard iogram (ECG) parameters have 
been observed in patients treated with ETX2514SUL. Transient in creases in systolic blood 
pressure within normal ranges were observed in healthy elderly subjects dosed with 
ETX2514SUL. 
 ETX2514, at the studied doses, had no clinically relevant effects on studied ECG parameters 
in a thorough QT study conducte d in healthy volunteers.

by [CONTACT_55642], particularly those that are resistant to carbapenems. The dose of sulbactam, 1.0 g q6h 
(maximum daily dose in patients with normal renal clearance of 4 g), that will be used in 
combination with ETX2514 is the highest dose approved for human use, often in combination with ampi[INVESTIGATOR_303185]. 
ETX2514 is a novel diazabicyclooctenone BLI with a spectrum of activity that encompasses 
clinically important β-lactamases of Ambler Class A and C and b road-spectrum inhibition of 
Class D β-lactamases. ETX2514 is not a BL. ETX2514 has greater potency than com parator BLIs, 
including clavulanic acid, tazoba ctam, and avibactam against al l Class A, C, and D enzymes tested. 
ETX2514 does not inhibit the Class B New Delhi Metallo-β-lactam ase 1.  
Sulbactam is classified as a BLI but also has intrinsic antibac terial activity against A. baumannii  
due to its inhibition of Penicillin Binding Protein 3, a transp eptidase that is essential for the final 
step of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis.
12 Although no breakpoint for A. baumannii  has been 
established by [CONTACT_303263] (CLSI) for sulbactam alone, sulb actam is used in combination with 
ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312] (in a 2:1 ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]:sulbactam ratio) in therapy for  A. baumannii . The CLSI has 
established breakpoints of 8/4 (am pi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/sulbactam) mg/L for this agent for Acinetobacter  
species. Because the activity of ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/sulbactam versus A. baumannii  can be attributed to the 
sulbactam component alone, the CLSI-defined susceptible breakpo int of 
8/4 (ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/sulbactam) mg/L that applies to the combination  suggests a susceptible breakpoint 
of 4 mg/L for sulb actam alone in A. baumannii .  
The addition of ETX2514 to sulbactam in vitro restores the acti vity of sulbactam such that the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to inhibit 90% of growth  versus a collection of recent 
A. baumannii  clinical isolates shifts from >32 mg/L to 2 mg/L in the presen ce of ETX2514 (held 
constant at 4 mg/L). In vitro experiments supported a susceptibility-testing paradigm of holding the concentration of ETX2514 cons tant at 4 mg/L while varying t he sulbactam concentration in 
2-fold increments. This activit y of sulbactam-ETX2514 was consi stent across A. baumannii  
isolates from different geogra phic regions and infection types and did not change in subsets of 
meropenem-resistant, colistin-resistant, or MDR isolates, nor d id it change over time (a total of 
3611 isolates collected from 2011 to 2018 were tested). A detai led assessment of human dose 
projection of sulbactam-ETX2514 was performed utilizing PK para meters from human Phase 1 
and Phase 2 data, lung penetration data, PK/pharmacodynamic (PD ) targets, and current MIC 
distribution versus A. baumannii . A preliminary probability of target attainment was completed. 
The result of these analyses sugg ested a 3-hour infusion of 1.0  g sulbactam/1.0 g ETX2514 
administered 4 times a day is predicted to be effective to trea t patients infected with A. baumannii  
with MICs 4 mg/L. Complete details of this assessment can be found in the  Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
Current treatment guidelines (In fectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society) 
for the treatment of HABP/VABP/VP due to A. baumannii  recommend the use of carbapenems or 
ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/sulbactam as first-line agents as long as the isolat es are sensitive to these drugs. 
However, in the event of carbapenem resistance, the current rec ommended regimens are to use 
polymyxins such as colistin to treat these infections. This stu dy utilizes a combination of colistin 
and imipenem as the comparator. The combination of a carbapenem  with a polymyxin has been 
shown to have increased activity in vitro against A. baumannii .
13 The selection of the comparator 
Entasis Therapeutics 
Clinical Study Protocol CS2514-2017-0004 
Confidential & Proprietary  
Version 4.0, 17 December 2020 37for this study is challenging. The possibility of utilizing “best-available care” as the comparator 
was considered, but it was determined that this was not a satis factory option because of the size of 
the study and the potential to confound assessment of comparati ve efficacy. On a world-wide basis, 
including Europe, the majority o f ABC isolates are MDR. Common regimens that are utilized 
include colistin either alone or plus a carbapenem and tigecycl ine plus [ADDRESS_370241] that tigecycline is not  indicated for treatment of pat ients with pneumonia in Europe or for 
the treatment of HABP/VABP/ VP in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Based on these considerations, th is study will use colistin plu s imipenem/cilastatin as the 
comparator. Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated for the treatment of HABP/VABP/VP and is widely 
used in this indication. Part A w ill enroll patients prior to t he availability of antibiotic sensitivities, 
and it is anticipated that appr oximately 40% of ABC infections could be sensitive to carbapenem. 
Imipenem/cilastatin would be th e drug of choice in this populat ion. For those patients with 
CRABC infection, colistin would be the drug of choice. Although recent data14 suggest that the 
addition of a carbapenem to co listin may not be synergistic in the treatment of CRABC infections, 
there was no suggestion of a negative effect of this combinatio n. Moreover, discontinuation of 
imipenem/cilastatin in these patients after randomization will result in unblinding of treatment 
assignment. Lastly, assessment of efficacy of the combination o f ETX2514 with both sulbactam 
and imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of CRABC infections would  entail not discontinuing the 
carbapenem in the investigationa l treatment group. Hence, all p atients in this study will receive 
imipenem/cilastatin regardless of the carbapenem sensitivity of  the ABC infection. 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, active-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_303186]2514SUL plus imipenem/cilastatin compared to colistin plus imipenem/cilastatin in the 
treatment of patients with ABC infections. In Part A, all patie nts will receive imipenem/cilastatin 
as the best treatment option for HABP, VABP, VP, and/or bactere mia caused by [CONTACT_55642]. In addition, 
the experimental group will receive ETX2514SUL, while the compa rator group will receive 
colistin, both agents targeting drug-resistant ABC. These combi nations of drugs should provide all 
patients with the best treatment  options for ABC infections, wh ile anticipating a high rate of drug 
resistant ABC infections.  
Part B will be the open-label, supportive portion of the study that will include patients known to 
have HABP, VABP, VP, and/or bacteremia infections associated wi th ABC organisms that are 
known to be resistant to colistin  or polymyxin B, those failing  a colistin or polymyxin B regimen 
prior to study entry or are on acute renal replacement therapy,  and patients with infections due to 
colistin- or polymyxin B-resistan t ABC with sources of infectio n other than HABP, VABP, VP, 
and/or bacteremia. The goal is to  gather preliminary efficacy a nd safety data in the setting of these 
other infections and provide a salvage option for XDR strains o f ABC infections; hence, Part B 
will not be pi[INVESTIGATOR_303187] a comparator. The objecti ve of Part B will be to estimate 
efficacy of the combination of sulbactam and ETX2514 against co listin- or polymyxin B-resistant 
ABC infecting various sites, as supporting evidence for Part A results. Safety of ETX2514SUL 
will be assessed as a whole in Part A and Part B. 
1.4 Risk/Benefit 
No unique contraindications have been determined for ETX2514. C ontraindications to the use of 
sulbactam include a history of hypersensitivity or allergic rea ctions to sulbactam or any 
cephalosporin, penicillin, or carbapenem.

Version 4.0, 17 December 2020 38ETX2514 was well tolerated in rep eat dose animal toxicology stu dies; no specific safety signals 
were observed that require special monitoring in human subjects . Reductions in absolute 
neutrophil count and monocytes were reported in the dog repeat dose toxicity studies and will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_303264]. 
Studies in healthy adult and elde rly subjects and in patients w ith renal impairment or cUTI have 
revealed no serious adverse drug r eactions or deaths to date, a nd the withdrawal rate due to adverse 
events has been low (1%). Adverse events have generally been mi ld to moderate in severity. The 
most common treatment-emergent a dverse events (TEAEs) in both healthy elderly subjects and in 
patients have included injecti on site reactions/pain and headac he; the less common TEAEs in 
patients were nausea, diarrhea , and vomiting. Overall, ETX2514S UL has been well  tolerated, and 
only 1 drug-unrelated serious adv erse event (SAE) has been repo rted to date. Doses of 
ETX2514SUL must be adjusted in pat ients with impaired renal fun ction. Mild decreases from 
baseline in mean WBC and neutro phil counts have been observed i n subjects receiving ETX2514 
alone or multiple doses of ETX2514 with imipenem/cilastatin. Mi ld increases in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) were observed with administration of ETX 2514SUL with 
imipenem/cilastatin. These findings were not considered clinica lly significant since mean values 
remained within the reference range at all time points. However , WBC counts and hepatic function 
will be monitored closely in ongoing clinical studies. No clini cally significant changes in vital 
signs or ECG parameters have been observed in patients treated with ETX2514SUL with or 
without imipenem/cilastatin. 
Although sulbactam is available as a standalone product in a sm all number of countries 
(eg, Combactam, [LOCATION_013]), the va st majority of human use is in combination with BLs 
(eg, Unasyn, combination of ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312]/sulbactam). The clinical  s a f e t y  o f  s u l b a c t a m  h a s  b e e n  
established by [CONTACT_47071] [ADDRESS_370242] dose approv ed for human u se (1.0 g q6h, maximum daily dose in patients 
with normal renal clearance of 4.0 g).[ADDRESS_370243] frequently reported adverse events reported with 
Unasyn are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain at the injection site, and skin rash. Hepatic 
dysfunction, including hepatitis  and cholestatic jaundice, has been associated with the use of 
sulbactam. Hepatic toxicity is us ually reversible; however, dea ths have been reported. Routine 
monitoring of liver function will be conducted at baseline and during and after administration of 
ETX2514SUL. 
D o s e  a d j u s t m e n t s  a r e  n e c e s s a r y  f o r  severe renal insufficiency a nd hemodialysis patients. It is 
expected that the combinati on of ETX2514SUL with imipenem/cilas tatin will have high levels of 
penetration in the lung and, hence, should show good efficacy i n treatment of patients with 
ABC pneumonia. Reproductive stud ies for ETX2514 have not yet be en completed, so precautions 
against exposure in pregnant women and avoidance of pregnancy o f participants in this study are 
necessary. Allergic and hypersensi tivity reactions are a potent ial risk, as with all antimicrobials, 
and patients with serious known allergies to BLs will not be en rolled in the study. 
Colistin is now used routinely for Gram negative infections tha t are resistant to carbapenems, based 
on treatment guidelines in most countries with high prevalence of such infections. The risk of 
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity a re well described in the coli stin label and the li terature. Dosing 
of colistin in this trial is weight-based and will be adjusted based on daily calculations of estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  Patients will be monitored f or worsening renal function and

enrollment in Part B of the study. 
Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated f or a broad variety of infecti ons and has been approved for use 
for many years for the treatment  of serious infections, includi ng those caused by [CONTACT_55642]. Key risks, 
including hypersensitivity and seizures, are well documented in  the literature. Dose adjustments 
for renal insufficiency are being implemented in the dosing of patients in this protocol as a key 
risk mitigation. Drugs that are c ontraindicated with the use of  imipenem/cilastatin are not allowed 
for use in this protocol.

In Part A, the following study drugs will be administered in a 1:1 randomized manner: 
 Group 1 (experimental group): 1.0 g ETX2514/1.0 g sulbactam IV infused over 3 hours q6h 
plus 1.0 g imipenem/1.0 g cilasta tin IV infused over 1 hour q6h; or 
 Group 2 (control group): 2.5 mg/kg colistin IV infused over 30 minutes q12h (after an initial 
loading dose of colistin 2.5 to 5 mg/kg) plus 1.0 g imipenem/1. 0 g cilastatin IV infused over 
1 hour q6h. 
In Part B, the following study drugs will be administered: 
 Group 3 (experimental group): 1.0 g ETX2514/1.0 g sulbactam IV infused over 3 hours q6h 
plus 1.0 g imipenem/1.[ADDRESS_370266] been selected based on 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 PK, safety,  and efficacy data and extensive PK/PD modeling and probability 
of target attainment against CRABC in the lung. Data from these  studies and details of the PK/PD 
modeling are provided in more deta il in the Investigator’s Broc hure. 
ETX2514 1.[ADDRESS_370267] Circular fo r Unasyn, in which the maximum 
approved daily dose in patients w ith normal renal clearance for  sulbactam is 4 g, which is 
equivalent to 1.0 g sulbactam q6h. 
The ETX2514SUL regimen of 1.0 g ETX2514/1.0 g sulbactam should be infused over 3 hours q6h 
given for 7 days to 14 days ( 28 doses to 56 doses), depending o n the clinical response.  
Imipenem/cilastatin will be ad ministered as a 1.0 g/1.0 g dose infused over 1 hour q6h given for 
the same duration as ETX2514SUL or colistin. Colistin will be administered at a  daily dose of 5 mg/kg of col istin base activity (CBA) divided 
into 2 doses 12 hours apart. Doses will be adjusted to ideal body weight in obese patients. Patients 
who weigh <60 kg with normal rena l function will receive a flat  dose of 300 mg CBA or 
9 million international unit (MIU )/day. A single loading dose o f 2.5 to 5 mg/kg (total dose not 
exceeding [ADDRESS_370268] of c are) given IV over 3 to 
6 minutes (or according to standard of care) will be administer ed on Day 1. Colistin infusions 
beyond the loading dose on Day 1 will begin 12 hours after the initial loading dose and will be 
infused over 30 minutes. Details on dosing for those patients who are on colistin prior to randomization into the study ca n be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Details of study drug preparation a nd administration can also b e found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
No dosing regimen changes, other  than those spec ified in the pr otocol for renal insufficiency (see

clinical outcomes at the Day 5, Day 7, EOT Visit, TOC Visit, LF U Visit, and ET Visit, if 
applicable. In Part A, in addition to the unblinded Investigato r, a blinded assessor will also 
determine clinical outcome. If t here is a discrepancy between t he assessment of the blinded 
assessor and unblinded Investigat or, the assessment from the bl inded assessor will be used. If there 
is a missing assessment from either the blinded assessor or unb linded Investigator, the other 
available assessment will be used (see Section 5.4.1). An adjud ication committee may be 
organized for endpoint adjudica tion should it be deemed necessa ry by [CONTACT_4318]. In such a case, 
a charter will be developed that describes their activities.

will be recorded in the eCRF. 
All patients must have a specimen sample from the site of infec tion (ie, respi[INVESTIGATOR_222255], 
blood, urine, or wound) and 2 sets of blood culture samples fro m 2 separate venipuncture sites 
collected at Screening. Screening respi[INVESTIGATOR_303212]/VABP/VP should be subjected to BPP rapid diagnostic testing as detailed above, where 
available, and submitted to the l ocal microbiology laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing. 
In these cases, if the local microbiology laboratory culture do es not grow ABC, the patient will be 
withdrawn from the study drug treatment. 
If the screening sample for culture that is growing ABC is take n per standard of care before the 
patient or patient’s legally aut horized representative signs in formed consent, that isolate may be 
used for baseline eligibility and sent to the central laborator y once consent is obtained, as long as 
the sample was colle cted within 72 hours prio r to randomization . Additional samples for baseline 
culture should be collected again within 24 hours prior to rand omization, at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A), and if cl inically indicated. Patients who are 
failing their current treatment as evidenced by [CONTACT_303278], 
provided they meet all other re quisites. However, additional sa mples must be taken from the site

The local laboratory will culture each sample for species ident ification, quantification (urine and 
BAL only), and susceptibility testing. Any organism isolated fr om the culture will be identified by 
[CONTACT_303279]. Potential pathogen(s ) cultured at the local laboratory, 
including species isolated from mixed infections with other Gram positive or Gram negative organisms, will be sent to a designated central laboratory for confirmation of species identification, 
susceptibility testing results, a nd potential molecular charact erization. 
All organisms identified on culture at the local laboratory and  the local laboratory assessment of 
susceptibility testing for each organism will be captured in th e eCRF.

this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease  temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not rel ated to the investigational medicinal 
product. All adverse events, incl uding observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 
Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variable s, will be monitored and 
documented from the time of the main informed consent (not the limited scope ICF) until study 
participation is complete. This is to be understood that Investigators should report any adverse 
event occurring from the time the  main ICF (including all study  procedures) was signed. 
Investigators are not required to report adverse events occurri ng for patients who only signed the 
limited scope ICF (which only al lows rapid testing on a respi[INVESTIGATOR_303223]). Patients should be 
instructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator. Beginning at 
enrollment, Investigators should make an assessment for adverse  events at each visit and record 
the event on the appropri ate adverse event eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associ a t e d  s i g n s  a n d

observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or

Additionally, the condition that l ed to a medical or surgical p rocedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, or transfusion)  should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at Screening should not b e reported as an adverse event 
unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at ba seline changes in severity or 
seriousness at any time during t he study. In this case, it should be reported as an adverse event. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination  (eg, ECG) findings that are 
detected during the study or are present at Screening and signi ficantly worsen during the study 
should be reported as adverse events. The Investigator will exe rcise his or her medical and 
scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal 
assessment is clinically signi ficant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring 
during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests r eturn to normal, stabilize, or are no 
longer clinically significant. A ny abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an adverse event. 
Newly emergent infections that appear after baseline will be re ported as adverse events and

moderate, or severe. In Part A, in addition to the unblinded In vestigator, a blinded assessor will 
also be responsible for the causality assessment, and as detail ed below. 
Assessment of severity: 
Mild – An event that is easily t olerated and generally not interfering with normal  daily activities. 
Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomforting to inter fere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incap acitating with inability to work  or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality assessment: 
The relationship of an adverse ev ent to the administration of t he study drug is to be assessed by 
[CONTACT_303286] A and by [CONTACT_303287] B, according to the following definitions: 
No (unrelated, not related, no re lation) – The time course betw een the administration of study drug 
and the occurrence or worsening of  the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of s tudy drug and the occurrence or 
worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal rela tionship and no other cause 
(concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], com plications, etc) can be ident ified. 
The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal rel ationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there  are facts (evidence) or argum ents to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clin ical context o f the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural h istory and course of the 
disease being treated and any othe r disease the patient may hav e. 
 Concomitant drug- o The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the pati ent receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized t o cause the event in 
question.

8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of the main informed consent ( not the limited scope ICF) or 
randomization until [ADDRESS_370307] be reported to 
Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence (this refers to any 
adverse event that meets any of t he aforementioned serious criteria). This is to be understood that 
Investigators should report any SAE occurring from the time the  main ICF (including all study 
procedures) was signed. Investig ators are not required to report SAEs occurring for patients who 
only signed the limited scope ICF (which only allows rapid test ing on a respi[INVESTIGATOR_152922]). All 
SAEs that the Investigator considers related to study drug occu rring after the 30-day follow-up 
period must be reported to the Sponsor. All SAEs should be repo rted as if it were a blinded study 
and without evidence of treatment assignment on the report. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed, Medpace Safet y personnel will be 
notified electronically and will retrieve the form. If the even t meets serious criteria 
and it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to Medpace Safety at

however, any abnormal LFT will be monitored according to the Sa fety Monitoring Plan. 
Investigators should evaluate sta ndard of care laboratory repor ts in addition to study laboratory 
reports when monitoring for LFTs. 
Abnormal liver che mistry criteria: 
The Investigator or sub-Investigator must review patient labora tory reports to identify if they meet 
the following criteria: 
 Moderate abnormality that happened after study drug administrat ion: 
o AST or ALT >2 × baseline or evidence of progressively increasin g levels despi[INVESTIGATOR_303228]; or 
o Total bilirubin >2 × baseline or evidence of progressively incr easing levels despi[INVESTIGATOR_303228]. 
 Severe abnormality: 
o Confirmed values of AST or ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN or evidence of 
acute hepatic insufficiency or failure, as evidenced by [CONTACT_303289]-Pugh score to 
B or C; or 
o Persistently high values of AST or ALT > 5 × ULN for 14 days.

If any [ADDRESS_370316] 
do the following: 
 Obtain a detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent d iseases. The Investigator 
should ensure that the medical history form captures any preexi sting illness that may be 
relevant in assessing hepatic function; 
 Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including over-the-co unter/herbal/dietary 
supplements); 
 Obtain a history of exposure to env ironmental chemical agents; 
 Following the initial observed elevation, every effort should b e made to have the patient 
reassessed within 24 hours to 48 hours. Repeat LFTs will be performed and sent to the central 
laboratory. Liver function tests may also be repeated via the l ocal laboratory at the discretion 
of the Investigator; 
 Patients who have an Investigat or-assessed, study drug-related elevation of their LFTs must be 
monitored 2 to 3 times per week  until liver function chemistrie s (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, and total bilirubin)  completely return to normal r ange or return to the baseline 
level and associated clinical si gns and symptoms return to base line levels. If the elevation of 
LFTs is attributed to a non-st udy drug-related issue (eg, chron ic hepatitis, chronic cholestasis, 
concomitant treatments, cardiovascular causes, etc), the patien t should be monitored until the 
LFTs stabilize or return to the p atient’s baseline level and as s o c i a t e d  c l i n i c a l  s i g n s  a n d  
symptoms return to baseline levels. The Investigator should con tact the Medical Monitor to 
discuss additional management and follow-up of patients with elevation of LFTs; 
 The event must be reported to Medpace within 48 hours to 72 hou rs after its occurrence on a 
Liver Event Form; 
 Consider a consultation with a spe cialist such as a hepatologist; and 
 Consider performing liv er imaging (ie, MRI , CT, or ultrasound). 
Hy’s Law definition:  
The definition of Hy’s Law is as follows: 
1. AST or ALT >3 × ULN; 
2. Total bilirubin >2 × ULN;  
3. No evidence of intra- or extra-h epatic bilirubin obstruction (e levated alkaline phosphatase) or 
Gilbert’s Syndrome; and 
4. No evidence of any other reason for increase in transaminases as noted above.  
If the first 3 criteria of Hy’s Law are met in a concurrent blo od sample, the case must be 
reported as an SAE.

Version 4.0, 17 December 2020 92Criteria for study drug discontin uation (severe hepatic abnorma lities): 
In the absence of an explanation for increased liver enzymes, t he patient should be discontinued 
from the study drug. Discontinuation should be considered if: 
 ALT or AST >10 × ULN; 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks or progressively incr easing transaminases 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_303195]; 
 AST or ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2  ULN or international normalized ratio >1.5 
(for patients who are not on coumadin);  
 AST or ALT >3 × ULN along with signs or symptoms compatible wit h hepatitis or 
hypersensitivity (eg, fatigue, na usea, vomiting, right upper qu adrant pain or tenderness, 
jaundice, fever, rash, or eosinophilia [>5%]); or 
 Close monitoring for a patient with moderate hepatic laboratory  test abnormality is not 
possible. 
Follow-up examination: 
If any abnormal liver chemistry criteria are met, the following  assessments should be obtained at 
the LFU Visit and documented in a Liver Event Form:  Clinical symptoms course; 
 Concomitant medications: over-th e-counter/herbal/dietary supple ments (start and stop dates); 
 Alcohol use; 
 Risk factors for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, such as diabete s, obesity, and 
hypertriglyceridemia; 
 Autoimmune hepatitis/cholangitis; 
 Wilson’s disease; and 
 Laboratory assessments. Based on the patient’s history, other t esting may be appropriate, 
including: 
o Acute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D , E, or other infectious agent s); and 
o Other laboratory tes ts, including interna tional normalized ratio and direct bilirubin.

9.1 Analysis Populations 
This study is designed to estim ate treatment efficacy of ABC infections, with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_303229] A.  
The ITT Population will include  all patients randomized to stud y drug treatment (ETX2514SUL 
plus imipenem/cilastatin or colistin plus imipenem/cilastatin) in Part A or enrolled in Part B, 
regardless of whether the patien t actually receives study drug.  
The Modified ITT (MITT) Population will include patients in Par ts A and B who meet ITT criteria 
and receive any amount of study  drug. The MITT Population will be considered the Safety 
Population. Patients with HABP/VA BP/VP who were randomized to P art A on the basis of a BPP 
rapid test result but were subsequently withdrawn due to a lack  of a culture gr owing ABC will be 
counted in the MITT and Safety Populations.  The m-MITT Population will include patients who meet MITT crite ria and have an ABC organism 
isolated as the qualifying culture specimen, as confirmed by [CONTACT_3433] e central and/or local microbiology 
laboratory. If an isolate for tes ting at the central laboratory  is not available, the local laboratory 
data can be used to confirm the presence of ABC organism, as long as the local laboratory uses 
modern methods of diagnosis such as molecular-based tests, matr ix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time-of-f light mass spectrometry, Vitek, Phoenix, etc (ie, not conventional 
biochemical or manual phenotypic methods). Patients with HABP/V ABP/VP who are enrolled 
based upon a positive BPP rapid test for ABC, but subsequently are found to have respi[INVESTIGATOR_303230] (by [CONTACT_12082]),  will be withdrawn from the study 
drug treatment as detailed in Section 4.3. These patients will not be included in the m-MITT 
Population but will remain in the MITT Population. 
The CRABC m-MITT Population will include patients who meet m-MI TT criteria and 
have a baseline ABC organism that is confirmed to be carbapenem -resistant (MIC to 
imipenem/meropenem 8 mg/L) by [CONTACT_303290] y the isolate for any reason. Patients will be excluded from the 
CRABC m-MITT Population if they have isolates that are deemed by [CONTACT_303291]2514SUL (MIC >4 mg/L) or colistin (MIC 4 mg/L), if their blood culture or

sensitivity analysis for the pri mary efficacy endpoint will be performed for patients whose eligible 
culture is >[ADDRESS_370317] dose of study drug, as well  as for all patients with and without 
evidence of non-susceptibilit y to colistin and ETX2514SUL at ba seline. 
The CE Population will include pa tients who meet m-MITT criteri a and meet evaluab ility criteria 
(meet key inclusion criteria, do not have key exclusion criteri a, received at least 72 hours of study 
drug [ie, 12 doses of ETX2514SUL plus 12 doses of imipenem/cila st

eligible culture is >[ADDRESS_370320] dose of study drug , as well as for all  patients with and 
without evidence of non-susceptibility to colistin and ETX2514S UL at baseline. Details of the 
sensitivity analysis will be described in the SAP. 
The non-inferiority assessment will be based on the 2-sided 95%  confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
difference ([ETX2514SUL + imipene m/cilastatin] – [colistin + im ipenem/cilastatin]) in 28-day 
all-cause mortality rates between the treatment groups. Non-inf eriority will be concluded if the 
upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI is less than +20%. 
If non-inferiority is achieved, a test of superiority will be p erformed.

(Day 1). All Screening laborator ies will be performed at the lo cal laboratory and may have been collected as standard of care within [ADDRESS_370343] dose of study drug. 
3. Day 7 to Day 14 study procedures  are only required if the patient receives IV study drug treatme nt on Day 7 to Day 14. If EOT has already occurred, s tudy procedures are 
not required to be performed. 
4. Patients will be treated for 28 doses of ETX2514SUL plus 28 doses of imipenem/cilastatin or 14 doses of colistin plus 28 doses  of imipenem/cilastatin (ie, 7 days for those 
without dose adjustments), with a  prolongation of therapy up to  [ADDRESS_370344] occur 7 days ( 2 days) after the EOT for all patients. The LFU Visit must occu r 14 days ( 2 days) after the EOT for all patients. The LFU Visit 
should be performed as an in-pers on visit; however, if the pati ent is unable to attend the LFU Visit at the site, the patient may be contact[CONTACT_303297]-up assessment of concomit ant medications, clinical signs  and symptoms, and adverse events.  All patients who are alive and have not withdrawn consent 
for participation in the study must be contact[CONTACT_218907] 28 or a nytime thereafter to assess survi val if their LFU Visit is prio r to Day 28. 
6. For patients who are w ithdrawn from the study prior to completi on of study drug or discontinue study drug prematurely, complet e an ET Visit at the time of study 
withdrawal or study drug disconti nuation. Patients who disconti nue study drug prematurely but a re not withdrawn from the study  should complete TOC  and LFU Visits. 
For patients who are withdrawn from the study after the EOT Vis it but prior to completion of the  study, complete the next sche duled visit (either the TOC Visit or LFU 
Visit) at the time of study withdrawal. 
7. Informed consent must be obtaine d before any study procedures a re performed. An ICF of limited s cope may be signed prior to Sc reening to perform only BPP rapid 
testing of respi[INVESTIGATOR_153194] . A comprehensive ICF, which wi ll include all study procedures , will be signed at Screening. 
8. Reas onable effort will b e made to determine all relevant treatm ents (including all antibiotics, prescription and non-prescript ion medications, herbal  medications, vitamin 
supplements, supportive therapie s, and non-pharmacologic treatm ents) received within [ADDRESS_370345] X-ray, MRI, C T scan, or ultrasound done within 72 hours of Screening is acce ptable. For images obtained 48 hours 
prior to randomization, repeat im aging is required. Note: If an  ultrasound is performed, a confirmatory X-ray or CT scan must be performed within 24 hours. Findings 
should be consistent w ith the screening imag e and diagnosis of pneumonia, in the Investigator’s  judgment; otherwise, the patie nt is no longer eligible. 
13. If a patient is a clinical failure at EOT, the patient is autom atically considered a failure a t the TOC and LFU Visits, and the assessment of clin ical response by [CONTACT_303298] “failure at EOT or TOC.”  
14. In Part A, all clinical outcome assessments will be performed b y a blinded assessor, in addition to the unblinded Investigator . 
15. A respi[INVESTIGATOR_303236], VABP, or  VP. 
16. An APACHE II or SOFA score will be calculated at Screening and prior to randomization for patien ts in Part A only. For patient s who are not being treated in an intensive 
care unit and cannot have an APACHE II or SOFA score performed,  and for all patients in Part B,  a qSOFA score should be calcul ated. 
17. An APACHE II, SOFA, or qSOFA score that was calculated as stand ard of care within [ADDRESS_370346] dose of study drug. 
22. The Day 5 safety chemistry panel will be performed at the local  laboratory and sent to the central laboratory. 
23. Hematology includes complete bl ood count (with red blood cell count, total white blood cell coun t with differential counts, pl atelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit).  
24. Urinalysis includes urine dipsti ck analysis for leukocytes, nit rites, or a catalase test of the urine specimen, microscopic ev aluation, specific gravity, and pH.

Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_370347]  in cases of clinically significant abnorm al findings (eg, a QTcF  480 msec). 
27. The 12-lead ECG will be performed for all patients at the end o f the first infusion of study d rug on Day 1. If clinically indi cated, the 12-lead ECGs will be repeated as 
close as possible following the end of the infusion of study dr ug administration on the day on which post-dose PK samples are drawn (Day 3, Day 4, or Day 5). The day on 
which the post-dose PK samples are drawn is at the discretion o f the Investigator.  
28. Two sets of samples from 2 separate venipuncture sites are requ ired for blood cultur es in all pati ents. Each set  of blood cult ure samples will be collected from a separate 
venipuncture site and will consis t of 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic  blood culture bottle (an additional aerobic bottle is allowed if an anaerobic culture is not standard practice at 
the site). If Screening/baselin e blood cultures are positive fo r ABC, repeat blood cultures s hould be obtained daily until neg ative or the patient is a treatment failure. To 
avoid unnecessary blood draws, the Investigator may wait until the result of the prior blood c ulture is known be fore performing the next blood culture. 
29. After screening, collect samples only as clinically indicated. To assess the primary indication and follow-up of the presentin g indication, all specimens will be sent to the 
local laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing per institutional standards. Pure cultu res of isolated pathogens will be shipped from the local laboratory to the central 
laboratory for confirmation of s pecies identification, suscepti bility testing, and possible mo lecular characterization.  
30. If the screening sample for cultu re that is growing ABC is take n per standard of care before the patient or patient’s legally authorized representative signs informed 
consent, that isolate may be used for baseline eligibility and sent to the central laboratory on ce consent is obtained, as lon g as the sample was co llected within 72 hours 
prior to randomization. Additional samples for baseline culture  should be collected again within 24 hours prior to randomizati on, at the specified time points and if 
clinically indicated.  
31. All patients will receive IV tr eatment for a minimum of 28 doses of ETX2514SUL plus 28 doses of imipenem/cilastatin or 14 dose s of colistin plus 28 doses of 
imipenem/cilastatin (ie, 7 days fo r those without dose adjustme nts), as described in the protoco l. For patients with normal re nal function, study drug infusions will be 
administered q6h ( 15 minutes) for ETX2514SUL and imipenem/cilastatin and q12h ( 15 minu tes) for colistin. 
32. Adverse events should be captured as describ ed in the protocol.  
33. Intense PK samples will be collected for the first approximatel y [ADDRESS_370348] 2 infusions on Da y 1, at the end of the 
infusion after the infusion pump is turned off (+15 minutes), 1 .5 hours ( 15 minutes) after the end of the  infusion, and immediately prio r to the start of the next infusion, 
and on Day 4 ( 1 day) at the end of the infusi on after the infusion pump is tu rned off (+15 minutes), and immediately prior to the start of t he next infusion. Sparse PK 
samples will be collected for all other patients enrolled in th e study (Parts A and B) immediate ly prior to the start of the n ext infusion on Day 1 and Day 4 ( 1 day). The 
patient should have received at  least [ADDRESS_370349]

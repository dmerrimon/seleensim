 Précis : 
Although genetic disorders of muscle that present at birth are rare, RYR1- related myopathies 
comprise the most common non- dystrophic congenital myopathy in the [LOCATION_002], with a 
prevalence of approximately 1/90,000 people (Amburgey et al, 2011) . Causative mutations in the 
ryanodine receptor gene of skeletal muscle, RYR1,  have been found in several myopathy 
subtypes, including central core disease and centronuclear myopathy. These mutations result in 
defective excitation -contraction coupling and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Most 
patients present in childhood with delayed motor milestones, extremity muscle weakness, 
impaired ambulation, joint contractures, progressive scoliosis, and in some cases eye movement paralysis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, an allelic condition. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_32259], no treatments exist to date.   
 RYR1  encodes a homotetrameric transmembrane ion channel, RyR1, which resides on the 
terminal sarcoplasmic reticulum in close proximity to the T -tubule. By [CONTACT_32314], it mediates excitation- contraction coupling and functions 
as a regulator of cellular calcium concentrations and redox homeostasis. Dowling et al. (2012) recently elucidated the latter mechanism in zebrafish and patient myotubes, showing that RYR1  
mutations result in increased oxidative stress and that this is rescued in both models by [CONTACT_27180] N -acetylcysteine (NAC), a known anti -oxidant. NAC  functions as a precursor of 
glutathione, an endogenous antioxidant that becomes deficient during oxidative stress.  This was 
substantiated by a cystic fibrosis clinical trial in which low glutathione levels in neutrophils 
undergoing oxidative stress signi ficantly increased with NAC administration.  
 
Dowling et al. (2012) found significant changes post NAC treatment including increased travel 
distance (endurance) in zebrafish and complete protection from cell death induced by [CONTACT_32315]. Thus NAC was a successful treatment in 
both ex vivo and in vivo model systems. Based on these results, we plan to perform a 
randomized, double -blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial of NAC in a subgroup of RYR1-
related myopathy patients as the first pathophysiologically based treatment for this devastating 
disorder.  
 The objectives of the study are to determine if NAC reduces oxidative stress , fatigability, and 
fatigue in a study population of patients with RYR1 -RM. The study pop ulation includes both 
males  and females [ADDRESS_31445] of Abbreviations

[ADDRESS_31447] common non- dystrophic congenital myopathy in the United 
States, with a prevalence of approximately 1/90,000 (Amburgey et al., 2011). Causative 
mutations in the gene ( RYR1)  have been found in several myopathy subtypes, including central 
core disease and centronuclear myopathy.   
The defining histopathological feature of RYR1 mutation on muscle biopsy is the 
presence of amorphous cores, likely due to reduced oxidative enzyme activity (Jungbluth et al., 2011). Most patients present in childhood with delayed motor milestones, extremity muscle weakness, impaired ambulation, joint contractures, progressive scoliosis, and, in some cases, eye movement paralysis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], or susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, an allelic condition (Jungbluth et al., 2011; Bevilacqua et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2007). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_32259], no treatments exist to date .  
RYR1  encodes a homotetrameric transmembrane ion channel, RyR1, which resides on the 
terminal sarcoplasmic reticulum in close proximity to the T -tubule. By [CONTACT_32316], it mediates excitation- contraction coupling and functions 
as a regulator of cellular calcium concentrations and redox homeostasis (Bevilacqua et al., 2011, Brookes et al., 2004; Betzenhauser and Marks, 2010).  RYR1 gene mutations result in defective 
excitation -contraction coupling and increased mitochondrial oxidative stress (Jungbluth et al, 
2011). 
To elucidate novel pathogenic mechanisms in RYR1 -RM, Dowling and colleagues 
(2012) employed expression array analysis in a zebrafish model of RYR1- RM ( ryr zebrafish), 
which disclosed abnorma lities in pathways associated with cellular stress. Further studies were 
completed to confirm the presence of increased oxidative stress. Beta -galactosidase, a measure of 
cellular stress in vivo , was elevated in ryr  zebrafish. Ryr  zebrafish also showed inc reased 
carbonylation by [CONTACT_32317], a marker of oxidative stress, compared to wildtype controls (Arbogast et al., 2009). DCFH, a measure of overall intracellular oxidant activity was tested in ryr  zebrafish 
against controls and the affected zebrafish showed i ncreased activity.  The increased oxidant 
activity appeared to be a direct result of the ryr  mutation. Similarly, myotubes from patients with 
RYR1 -RM showed increased oxidative stress (in DCFH assay and oxyblot analysis). Further 
studies were completed to determine if oxidative stress in RYR1 -RM is due to over -abundant 
oxygen species or to insufficient antioxidants (GSH). Dowling et al. (2012) measured the 
expression of genes related to antioxidant defense.  There were no changes in the expression of the fo llowing antioxidant genes: catalase, superoxide dismutase 1, mitochondrial superoxide 
dismutase and extracellular superoxide dismutase.  These results indicate the cause of oxidative stress is not a lack of antioxidants, but rather over -abundance of reacti ve oxygen species (ROS). 
Possible sources of reactive oxygen species include NADPH oxidase complex (Hidalgo et al., 2006), PTGS2, and mitochondria.  Dowling et al. (2012) tested all three potential sources, yet only mitochondria appeared to be the cause of  the over -production of ROS. 
Given these findings, Dowling et al. (2012) subsequently tested the effect of NAC in 
cultured patient myotubes and zebrafish. N -acetylcysteine (NAC)  is an antioxidant and a 
precursor to GSH.  By [CONTACT_32318], NAC augments the cell’s 
reducing potential and restores the redox imbalance ( Tirouvanziam et al., 2006) .  In the 
experiment, control myotubes and RYR1- related myopathy myotubes were exposed to oxidants, 
9 
 producing a higher cell death rate in RY R1-RM myotubes.  However, when pre -treated with 
NAC, the RYR1 -RM myotubes were completely protected from cell death. Ryr zebrafish 
endurance and swim velocity were also tested.  When treated with NAC, ryr zebrafish showed 
rescued endurance (represented by [CONTACT_32319]), matching the endurance of controls treated 
with NAC.  However, strength (represented by [CONTACT_32320]) did not appear to improve for ryr zebrafish treated with NAC.  These findings corroborate the known mechanism of NAC, which functions as a precursor of GSH, an endogenous antioxidant that becomes deficient during oxidative stress.   
 Based on these findings regard ing NAC’s effect on RYR1 -RM in zebrafish and patient 
myotubes and on evidence of improved oxidative stress (increased GSH) in NAC human trials for other conditions, we plan a clinical proof of concept study.  15 -F2t-isoprostane  likewise 
measures oxidative stress  (due to lipid peroxidati on) and has been reported as the most accurate 
method to assess in vivo oxidative stress  status (Milne et al. 2012) . Early animal studies showed 
that glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a reducing agent mediated by [CONTACT_32321], may be 
important for combatting peroxidation of mitochondrial lipid membranes by [CONTACT_32322] (McCay et al. 1976). NAC is a direct precursor to glutathione  (Schmitt et al. 2015), and RYR1 -
RM preclinical studies showed that the source of oxidative stress in preclinical disease  models 
was due to mitochondrially derived reactive oxygen species (Dowling et al . 2012).   
The treatment group will receive 15mg/kg /day (no more than 1800 mg/ day) for the first week .  
After the first week, subjects who weigh fewer than 50kg will receive 30mg/kg/day of NAC  (no 
more than 2700mg/day) divided TID over a period of six months.  To increase compliance, as 
the tablets are formulated as 900mg each, subjects who weigh greater than 50kg will receive 
2700mg/day.  This dose is within the range of study references and was approved by [CONTACT_32323] (125141) for this trial.   
This dose is scientifically acceptable. The dose of 2700mg/day  is similar to that of other  
clinical trials.  A trial of NAC for cystic fibrosis, using a dose of 0.[ADDRESS_31448] predictor of CF pulmonary function, markedly decreased (P = 0.006) and the treatment 
was safe (Tirouvanziam et al., 2006). NAC is currently  indicated as a mucolytic for cystic 
fibrosis and other pulmonary conditions. A pediatric study was completed in three to ten year 
olds with autism to treat behavior issues (Hardan et al, 2012).  The dosage began as 900mg once 
a day for four weeks, and wor ked up to 900mg TID for four weeks (entire trial was 12 weeks).  
NAC decreased irritability in the population, measured by [CONTACT_32324] (Aberrant Behavior 
Checklist) Irritability Score.  Side effects were related to GI issues, but there was no significant diffe rence between the side effects of the control group and the treatment group.  A  trial of NAC 
in patient with fibrosing alveolitis  showed increased GSH levels over a period of 12 weeks  
(idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)  and is now FDA -approved for this indicat ion (Behr et al, 1997). 
Natural history data for RYR1- RM are limited to date, but the Motor Function Measure ( MFM ), 
a scale that measures motor function, has been validated in this population and has shown stable motor function scores over a 1 year time pe riod (Vuillerot et al., 2012). We intend to use the 
MFM as a gold -standard outcome measure to track progression of disease in the natural history 
portion of this trial.  Clinical manifestations usually improve in early childhood and may remain stable for s ome years, as RYR1 -RM is not degenerative. However, natural history data observing

  2.  Study objectives  
 
Aim 1.  To determine if NAC reduces oxidative stress in patients with RYR1 -RM.  
Hypothesis: Compared to the placebo group and baseline values for each patient, N -
acetylcysteine will reduce oxidative stress in the treatment group as evidenced by:  1) decreased 
15-F2t-isoprostane  in urine , 2) decreased 2’,7’ -Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) in biopsied 
muscle, and 3) increased glutathione (GSH) in blood.  E xploratory marker s of anaerobic 
thres hold, fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] O2, and tissue oxygenation by [CONTACT_32325] (NIRS)  
will also be measured pre and post treatment.  
 
Aim 2.  To determine if NAC reduces fatigability and fatigue in patients with RYR1 -RM.  
Hypothesis: Compared to the placebo group and baseline values for each patient, N -
acetylcysteine will reduce fatigability (objective construct) and fatigue (subjective construct) in 
the treatment group as evidenced by:  (for fatigability) 1) the 6MWT,  2) timed function tests , 3) 
grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_32261], as measured by [CONTACT_32326]  4)  muscle fatigability by [CONTACT_32327] -; and (for 
fatigue) 5) Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System  (PROMIS ), 6) 
Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) fatigue scale, 7) Fatigue scales: 
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (M FI). 
As secondary and exploratory measures, we will also test the following pre and post treatment: 
CPET by [CONTACT_32328], Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) to measure skeletal mus cle 
health, muscle MRI to evaluate for subclinical muscle involvement as well as the health of muscle tissue, MFM for motor function, salivary fatigue biomarker index (FBI) , melatonin, 
dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA),  the NeuroQoL scale, and qualitative inte rview for health 
related  quality of life.

4.  Study Design  and Methods : 
 
a.  Study overview  
The study design has two phases: first, a prospective natural history study and second, 
prospective, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled phase.  Each participant will be in 
the study for about 18 months from start to finish, with a total of three visits  of 4-6 days each  and 
7 phone ca lls and/or emails . All emails containing Patient Identifying Information  are to  be sent  
using secure email, behind the NIH firewall ( SEFT ).  Participants will be given a link to SEFT 
and will be asked to send all medical records and other sensitive information through the SEFT 
system.   Visits will be outpatient at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, 
MD. Samples will be analyzed at National Institutes of Health or at the  Eicosanoid Core Facility 
at Vanderbilt University, Tennessee on a fee -for-service basis. Analyses will be overseen by [CONTACT_32331]’s Director, [CONTACT_32383] .  
In the natural history phase (Phase 1) , participants will be seen at baseline, called one 
month later (for re -test reliability of fatigue and quality of life scales ), and will be seen again at 
13 
 six months  (±2 weeks)  to undergo procedures  by [CONTACT_32332] . The participants will complete the scales at home, using CTSS . Sixty to one 
hundred healthy volunteers will undergo a physical exam, study biomarker, NIRS testing, and 
muscle ultrasound only, in one outpatient visit to NIH. Eight -32 of these healthy volunteers  will 
also undergo a muscle MRI  (2-8 people from each of the 4 age groups.  See Inclusion Criteria for 
age groups of healthy volunteers) .  Outcome measures are listed and described under “Outcome 
Measures”. Since many  outcome measures used in thi s study are already well established and 
have been previously used to measure function in other neuromuscular diseases, we will only validate measures novel to RYR1- RM, such as NIRS, biodex fatigue index, and salivary fatigue 
biomarker s.  The self -administered questionnaires  will also be validated by [CONTACT_32333] 20 participants at 0 months and 1 month. 
After data collection at six months , for each individual participant , the participant will 
immediately begin  the second phase of the stud y when they will be randomized , using block 
randomization, to a placebo or a study drug group at the end of the 6 -month visit to NIH . The 
allocation scheme is computer -generated using random permuted blocks to maintain balance of 
the two groups  (placebo an d control) and to maintain balance between children and adults . The 
participant will be randomized to the study drug or placebo group by [CONTACT_32334], who is blinded to the allocation scheme.  Study drug assignments are recorded by [CONTACT_32335],  to be  
revealed  only after the study is complete.  BioAdvantex Pharma  will provide  oral effervescent 
NAC capsules , (PharmaNac) as well as identically packaged placebo capsules so that 
participants will not be able to distinguish the treatment from placebo.   The study drug group 
will receive 15mg/kg /day (no more than 1800 mg/ day) for the first week . After the first week, 
subjects who weigh fewer than 50kg will receive 30mg/kg/day of NAC (no more than 
2700mg/day) divided TID over a period of six months.  To i ncrease compliance, as the tablets 
are formulated as 900mg each, subjects who weigh greater than 50kg will receive 2700mg/day.  
After Phase 2 starts, participants will be observed at the NIH for 2 days.  They will then 
receive a phone call and/or email at a pproximately one and three  weeks to monitor their status on 
the study drug or placebo by a health care professional.  After the first month, the subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_17084]/or email monthly  (month 2, 3, 4, and 5) . Participants will be 
expected to take the ir dose three times per day for about six months. Adherence will be assessed  
by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32264] [ADDRESS_31452] -treatment visit (third visit) .  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_32265] 3- mont h phone call assessment and by 
a member of our team at NIH during their third visit.   Finally, the outcome measures will be 
obtained at the final visit 6 months (± 2 weeks) after start of treatment (about 12 months into the study) .  Six months after their  third visit (± 2 weeks ), the participant will be called for a post -
treatment  follow up.  The participant (or parent) will be asked open- ended questions to assess 
their symptoms  and current medication regime .  They will also be asked to fill out the same 
fatigue and QoL scales completed during their visits, at home on CTSS.  The participant will then be finished with the study . Please see Appendix A for a detailed Visits and Procedures 
Schedule.  
 
b.  Recruitment  
Although RYR1 congenital myopathies constitute a rare disease, the PIs and AIs on this protocol  
work closely with patient s with this condition and with patient  groups such as the Muscular 
Dystrophy Association and Cure CMD. We will advertise the study through the patient groups 
by [CONTACT_32336] s (Appendi x B). We will 
[ADDRESS_31453] information to health care providers 
in the neuromuscular field (Appendix D) . If interested, potential participants can call the research 
coordinator listed on the advertisements .  
Flyers have been created for healthy volunteer and patient populations  (Appendix B) .  The 
patient flyer includes contact [CONTACT_32337] a nd Public Liaison office 
(PRPL) .  We will distribute our flyer s to the managers of the Facebook  group pages entitled: 
“The RYR -1 Foundation” , which is found at this link: 
https://www.facebook.com/ryr1foundation/?fref=ts , and  
“Central  Core  Disease  & Minicore:  a place for support, learning  & friends” , which is found at 
this link: https://www.facebook.com/groups/243087794204/ . We will also tweet our study at 
https://twitter.com/NINR  and use the web slide carousel on the NINR website 
https://www.ninr.nih.gov/researchandfunding/dir#.VzzUSRIrKRs , to advertise our study.   
 A telephone or email prescreening  will be used to determine preliminary eligibility (prescreen 
quest ionnaire, Appendix G ). The prescreening telephone call will be scheduled  or the prescreen 
questions will be sent via email.   During the prescreening phase , we will request the potential 
participant send the results of their genetic testing confirming diagn osis of RYR1 (if done) and 
the results of their muscle biopsy confirming RYR1 histopathology  (if done).  We will receive 
these documents via mail, fax, or secure email before their visit.  This will prevent patients who are clearly not eligible from making  an unnecessary trip to NIH.  The records of any participant 
who subsequently does not qualify will be destroyed or returned to the participant.  
We will not request records of relatives of participants/potential participants who are 
enrolling under the cr iteria of a clinical diagnosis with a family member with confirmed RYR1.  
 
There is no direct solicitation of employees/staff by [CONTACT_32338].  Direct solicitation by [CONTACT_3252] -workers 
is considered  improper.  
 
c.  Screening  
Patients:   
Informed consent will be obtained before any study procedures begin.  We will screen 
participants by [CONTACT_32339]/exclusion criteria  by [CONTACT_32340] (Appendix E) . 
At the onset of the study, individuals w ill be required to have a documented muscle 
biopsy confirming RYR1 diagnosis . If [ADDRESS_31454] 6 months , those  with out muscle biopsy confirmation will also be 
enrolled . 
Healthy Volunteers:  
Healt hy volunteers will be screened by [CONTACT_648] , email,  or in -person for the presence of any 
neurological condition and/or complaints of weakness and fatigue  and will be asked about 
current medications , per the eligibility criteria.  
 
d.  Study procedures  
Patients:  
Participants will travel to the NIH Clinical Center three times over the course of one year.  At 
each visit, participants will complete some or all of the outcome measure tests and up to [ADDRESS_31455]  for clinical care.   
 
Medical  History: Participants will have access to an encrypted online survey system (Clinical Trial 
Survey System or CTSS) to enter their coded  medical history information. Participants will be 
given the website and login by [CONTACT_2413].  Legal guardians may enter this information for 
minors. Study physicians, nurse practitioners and/or nurses will obtain medical history information to supplement the online medical history if needed.  
 
Physical Examination : Height, weight, head circumference, BMI, and ulna leng th may be obtained 
by [CONTACT_32341], including nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians, and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Height, ulnar length, and head circumference will be repeated in children only at visit 2 and 3. For participants  with contractures, height may  be estimated by [CONTACT_32342] a segmometer, 
which has been shown to correlate with height. If available, a sling scale will be used to weigh participants  who are unable to stand on a scale.  Study physicians or nurse practitioners will perform 
a physical examination including the evaluation of cranial nerves, reflexes, sensation, strength, 
gait, movement, motor function and coordination. The physical examination will take approximately 30 minutes.  
 
Cardiology : Cardiologic evaluations in individuals will include electrocardiogram (EKG), which 
is required prior to CPET. EKGs take [ADDRESS_31456] of the study procedures.  
 
Pulmonary Functions Tests : Each subject will perform pulmonary function testing (PFTs) to assess 
vital capacity (VC) and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV). To measure VC t he participant will 
be asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into a flow sensor. For maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) the patient will be instructed to breathe as fast and deep as possible for [ADDRESS_31457], soft nose clips may be used to prevent air escapi[INVESTIGATOR_32266] (patients will use their own flow sensors so filters will not be needed) . Measures to be 
obtained include vital capacity (VC), forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_32267] 1 second (FEV1), and maximal voluntary ventilation. Pulmonary Function testing will take approximately 30 minutes.  
 
Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET):   The cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) will be 
administered using an electronically braked cycle ergometer.  Subjects will be asked to mai ntain 
a pedaling cadence of at least 30  revolutions per minute (rpm) for the entire test.  Subjects will 
begin the CPET pedaling against an unloaded work rate for the first minute after which point the work rate will increase each additional minute.  The C PET will be stopped when the subject can 
no longer maintain the predetermined pedaling cadence despi[INVESTIGATOR_32268].   Test duration, maximal oxygen uptake (VO
2max), and Anaerobic Threshold, determined  using the 
16 
 V-slope method, will be obtai ned during CPET testing. CPET takes approximately 1 hour to 
complete.   
 
Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) Assessment : Measurements of electrical impedance of 
muscle tissue will be made to determine the health of the muscles by [CONTACT_32343]. Current and sensing electrodes are placed non- invasively on 
the subject’s skin at known distances and the voltage at the sensing electrode is measured. Resistance, reactance, and the phase of multiple muscles are then recorded and the interpretation of these results is used to determine the health of the muscle tissue.  
 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) : An MRI scan of the leg muscles may be performed in order 
to visualize structures using a 1.[ADDRESS_31458] :  A blood pressure cuff will be placed 
around the distal thigh of the dominant leg. A near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) light source and receiving sensors will be placed on the leg, distal to the occlusion. Using a Hokanson® rapid inflation vascular testing system, the cuff will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_32269] a pressure that totally occludes blood flow into the gastrocnemius, typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] 60 and 80 mmHg above resting systolic pressure. The occlusion will be maintained for up to 10 minutes and tissue saturation will be measured over the time course. The tissue saturation index will be calculated as TOI = 
[O2-Hb] / Tot -Hb. The rate of decline and rise in TOI will be the main muscle tissue saturation 
measures.  
 
Physical therapy:  Evaluation will include timed  funct ional  tests: [ADDRESS_31459].  Grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_32271]. The myogrip is a hand held dynamometer designed to measure grip strength, while  the myopi[INVESTIGATOR_32272] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32273]. 
The patient will be seated comfortably with his/her elbow flexed to [ADDRESS_31460] in neutral position. The patient is asked to squeeze the dynamometer and pi[INVESTIGATOR_32274]. This process is repeated three times (3 trials). Time to complete: 30 min.  
 
Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM):  The MFM is a generic scale which provides a measurement 
of the effects of muscle weakness in neuromuscular diseases (NMD). Assessments ar e based on 
posture and movements of the whole body. It is applicable to both ambulant and non- ambulant 
patients with a wide range of disease severity. The patient is asked to roll, sit, lift head from prone 
and supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], get up from a lying position, prop on arms, kneel, crawl, stand and step. This test will be combined with timed tests (floor to stand, ascend/descend 4 steps). Time to complete both test s: approximately 60 minutes .  
 
17 
 6 Minute Walk (6MWT): The self -paced 6MWT assesses the submaximal l evel of functional 
capacity. The patient  is asked to walk for [ADDRESS_31461] to ensure patient’s safety.  Heart rate and blood pressure is monitored 
before and after exercise and after [ADDRESS_31462]:  approximately 20 minutes.   
 
Biodex : Biodex  will be used to test muscle groups using a dynamic sub -max fatigue test with a 
repetitive motion.  Blood pressure will be taken prior to testing to confirm the patient is not 
hypertensive (>140/90). Clinicians will assess participants for previous knee injury prior to 
testing.  The biodex t est will not be performed if the participant has a history of knee injury . 
Clinicians will provide a [ADDRESS_31463]:  approximately 60 mi nutes.   
 Phlebotomy, Genetic Testing , and Exome Sequencing : Phlebotomy will be performed to obtain 
blood for liver function testing  at baseline and glutathione levels . Blood and blood products may 
be analyzed or stored for creatine kinase (CK) level, lact ate/pyruvate ratio, c ell counts, blood 
chemistries, molecular genetic analysis and DNA banking. The lab will draw blood for DNA to 
confirm a genetic mutation, for exome sequencing, and/or for future studies and other clinical lab testing. If confirmatory g enetic testing of an enrolled family member reveals that a participant 
does not have an RYR1  mutation causative of RYR1- RM, the participant will be informed and 
withdrawn from the study.    
DNA studies may increase knowledge of the pathomechanism underlying  RYR1. The target 
blood draw is 30ml. A local anesthetic cream such as Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics 
(EMLA) may  be used to minimize the pain for young children. Phlebotomy will take 
approximately 15 minutes.  Blood will not be drawn on participants if they are known to be anemic (Hgb < 8 gm/dl) per medical history, or if their medical condition causes an investigato r 
to believe that blood drawing might be detrimental to the participant. For pediatric participants, 
no more than 5 mL/kg will be drawn in a single day, and no more than 9.5 mL/kg will be drawn 
over any eight -week period. Timing of blood draw will be betwe en 8:30- 10:30am and will be 
taken prior to any food consumption. Participants will be notified the night before not to consume food prior to the blood draw the next day.  
 
Saliva collection : For the saliva collection, patients will be asked to chew on a cot ton swab for 
about 5 minutes and then deposit the cotton swab in a specimen container.   Saliva will be 
measured for exploratory salivary biomarkers of fatigue such as fatigue biomarker index, 
melatonin, cortisol , and didehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA). Saliva  will be collected the same 
day as the blood draw by a health care professional between 8:30 and 10:[ADDRESS_31464].  The saliva will be put on ice immediately and stored at - 80.   
 
Urine collection : Participants will be asked to provide a clean catch urine sample  of at least [ADDRESS_31465]  levels of 15 -isoprostane -F2 (normalized for creatinine) , 
which allows for the indirect measurement of ROS . Additionally, urine samples will be used for 
pregnancy tests. 
18 
  
Pregnancy testing : All women and girls of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test 
performed at each visit, which must be negative before proceeding further with the study . 
Contraception will be required for women and girls of childbearing age  who are sexual ly active  
during phase [ADDRESS_31466] is positive, the study participant will be notified of 
the results.  If the study participant is a minor, she will be notified, and we will help her inform her 
parent(s) or guardian of the results. Women who become pregnant during the study will be 
followed through their pregnancy and birth. 
 
Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or Photography : Videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_32275]. W hen possible, the patient’s 
face and other identifying marks will not be included in the recording or photograph in order to 
protect confidentiality. C onsent will be obtained for videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_32276].  
 
Qualitative interviews and/or questionnaires of  fatigue and quality of life : Questionnaires to be 
used include  Neuromuscular Quality of Life (NeuroQOL), the Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) , FACIT  (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness 
Therapy), and MFI  (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory).  Patients and/or parents will be asked to 
participate in research qualitative interviews.  Parent proxy measures and patient outcome measures 
will be used to measure patient quality of life and daily function. Interview s and questionnaires 
will take approximately 2 hours.  The NeuroQOL, PROMIS, FACIT, and MFI will be 
readministered at 1 month after the initial visit and will be completed by [CONTACT_32344].   
Coded questionnaires may be administered online in a dat abase such as CTSS or Assessment 
Center Lite.  
 
Muscle Ultrasound: Ultrasound will be used to evaluate skeletal muscles using standard medical 
soft tissue ultrasound. Muscle ultrasound will take approximately 30 minutes.   
 
Muscle biops y (OPTIONAL, Adults Only) : A needle muscle biopsy will be obtained twice 
during the study on up to [ADDRESS_31467]. Meilleur’s research team,  
will allocate an approximately equal number of subjects from each arm of the study based on the randomization scheme created  for the entire study  in advance by [CONTACT_32345]: approximately 10 subjects from the intervention arm will be biopsied, approximately 10 subjects from the placebo arm will be biopsied. An  outside muscle biopsy performed by [CONTACT_32346]’ local providers in the six months prior to the study 6- month time point will also be 
acceptable, to reduce the number of invasive procedures.   
 This muscle biopsy will be performed on the  vastus lateralis or  tibiali s anterior  muscle.   After 
skin preparation using povidone -iodine or equivalent antiseptic, the skin and subcutaneous 
tissues will be ane sthetized with 7 -10 ml of 1% lidocaine without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  For side -cut 
biopsy needles (known as Bergstrom or UCHL needles) a 3mm incision will be made in the skin and muscle fascia, and muscle tissue will be obtained with 1 to 3 successful passes of the  biopsy 
needle.   Successful passes are defined as passes which obtain a ny muscle tissue.  Due to issues, 
such as  fatty infiltration of muscle in RYR1 -RM, one additional  incision may be made to obtain 
muscle tissue . The total number of passes will be limite d to 6. Biopsy specimens (5 to 40 mg) 
19 
 will be frozen as 1 or 2 aliquots depending on tissue yield.  The aliquots will be frozen in liquid 
nitrogen within 2 minutes  of removal and stored at - 80°C until use . If additional  tissue is 
obtained, it will be prepa red as primary muscle cells and/or cell lines .  Patients will be evaluated 
on the last day of the study visit to ask about post -biopsy pain or complications.  To minimize 
variance resulting from time of day or muscle activity , the biopsy will be performed at a similar 
time of day and after a similar schedule of activities in all subjects at both study visits.  Participants will be provided with a “ Needle Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_32277]” (Appendix I.) prior to their visit, which describes the pre -procure medication 
restrictions, procedure details, and post -procedure care instructions.  This muscle biopsy will not 
be performed in minors.   
Administration of study drug : Before participants return for their seco nd visit, they (and/or their 
parent) will be provided with a “ Medication/Placebo Information and Instructions Sheet” 
(Appendix J).  This sheet provides information about the drug, dosages, side effects, and contact [CONTACT_3031].  The study drug group will r eceive 15mg/kg /day (no more than 1800 mg/day) for 
the first week. After the first week, subjects who weigh fewer than 50kg will receive 30mg/kg/day of NAC (no more than 2700mg/day) divided TID over a period of six months.  To increase compliance, as the t ablets are formulated as 900mg each, subjects who weigh greater 
than 50kg will receive 2700mg/day. After the initial dose, participants will have two outpatient clinic visits with vital signs at the NIH. The first clinic visit will include [ADDRESS_31468] dose is administered.  The second clinic visit will be the following day and will also include vitals.  
 
Phone calls  and emails : Participants will be called or emailed one month after their first visit as a 
reminder to complete  the FACIT, MFI, NeuroQoL, and PROMIS  scales .  Additional phone call s 
and/or emails will occur 1 week, 3 weeks and then monthly starting at 2 months after the placebo or drug is started to check for tolerability.  
  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_692] :  Participants will be instructed  to count their pi[INVESTIGATOR_32278] , during  their [ADDRESS_31469]- intervention (third) visit.  During that  visit, 
the leftover pi[INVESTIGATOR_32279].  All participants should have some remaining pi[INVESTIGATOR_32280], as 
a precaution.  If it is discovered that a participant has missed >20% of their expected number of 
doses during their 3- month post intervention assessment, the participant will be informed that 
they need to increase their compliance, in order to remain in the study.  If it is discovered that a participant has missed >20% of their expected number of doses after returning for their third visit, the participant will be withdrawn from the study due to non -compliance.

Children will be given extra time to get adjusted to the new environment in the imaging facility, as well as in the scan room to alleviate anxiety and nervousness.   Sedation will not be used for any procedure.  
  
e. End  of participation  
Patients:  
22 
 Participants will remain under the care of their local physicians and/or primary neurologist while 
under this study .  Participants will receive the results of any clinically relevant findings during 
the study.  
Healthy Volunteers:  
Healthy volunteers will have one visit only during Phase 1 and then their participation will be 
complete.  
 5.  Storage of D ata and S amples  
Patients:  
If permitted  by [CONTACT_32347] , samples and data will be retained, 
including  samples (blood, DNA, urine) and data (results of rehabil itation medicine 
Department testing, questionnaires, and qualitative interviews) . This protocol is subject to 
the Genomic Data Sharing Policy. De -identified e xome data will be submitted to a 
database (to be decided)  through unrestricted access within [ADDRESS_31473]. 
Meilleur ’s team  on the NIH campus.. De -identified samples will be sent to Emory 
University for analysis only and will not be stored at Emory. M TAs have been obtained 
to transfer coded  muscle tissue samples  and coded  genetic mutations  to [CONTACT_32384] 
at Columbia University.  Mutations identified by [CONTACT_32348]. Andy Marks (NR -MTA -16-002) by [CONTACT_32349]/or 
designated his lab members .  A Certificate of Confidentiality is not needed.  
 
Samples will be sent to [CONTACT_32385] at Vanderbilt University  and [CONTACT_32386] at 
Emory University for anal ysis on a fee -for-service basis . These entities may also assist in 
interpretation of de -identified data for their respective analyses . Samples  and data will be 
shared with [CONTACT_32380] at Hyperion ( non-genomic data) and [CONTACT_32384] at 
Columbia University (including genomic da ta).   
 
Data and samples may also be shared with collaborating laboratories at NIH or outside of 
NIH and/or submitted to NIH -designated repositories and databases if consent for sharing 
was obtained . Repositories receiving data and/or samples from this protocol may be 
open- access or restricted access.  
 
Samples and data will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded (“de -identified”) or 
unlinked from an identifying code (“anonymized”). When coded data is shared, the key to the code will not be provided to collaborators, but will remain at NIH.  Data and samples may be shared with investigators and institutions with an FWA or operating under the Declaration of Helsinki (DoH) and reported at the time of continuing review.  Analyses at Vanderbilt and Emory Universities will be conducted on a fee -for-service 
basis. Sharing with investigators without an FWA or not operating under the DoH will be submitted for prospective IRB approval.  Submissions to NIH -sponsored or supported 
databases and repositories will be reported at the time of Continuing Review.  
23 
 Submission to non- NIH sponsored or supported databases and repositories will be 
submitted for prospective IRB approval.  
 
Required approvals from the collaborating institution will be obtained and materials will 
be shipped in accordance with NIH and federal regulations.    
 
Healthy Volunteers:  
If permitted by [CONTACT_32350], samples and data will be retained, including samples (blood, urine, saliva) . The location of storage for the samples will be 
the laboratory of the National Institute of Nursing Research.  Data will be stored in the office of [CONTACT_32387] on the NIH campus. De -identified samples will be sent to 
Vanderbilt and Emory Universities for analysis and will not be stored at eithe r site.  
 
6.  Additional Considerations  
 a.  Research with investigational drugs or devices  
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) requires an IND , and the FDA approved IND number is: 125141.  The 
company providing  NAC is BioAdvantex  Pharma.  The study sponsor is [CONTACT_32388] rine Meilleur 
at NIH.  
 
7.  Risks and D iscomforts  
 
Medical h istory: There may be some psychological distress associated with providing medical and 
family history. Frequent breaks or even cessation of procedure may be taken to reduce risk of 
distress.  
 Physical examination: There is minimal medical risk and discomfort from the physical 
examination. This risk also applies to healthy volunteers.  
 Cardiology evaluation: There are no known complications associated with a cardiology consult or 
the use of echo cardiography. Patients  may experience slight discomfort from laying still. There 
are no known risks for the EKG, however patients  may experience discomfort with removal of the 
electrodes or a topi[INVESTIGATOR_32283]. There are no  known risks for 
Holter monitoring however prolonged application of the adhesive electrode patches may cause skin breakdown irritation at the application site.  
 Pulmonary Function Tests:  There minimal risks. Participants may feel tired after the procedures.  
 CPET:  Decreased risk when screened and monitored with 12 lead EKG. 1/20,000 deaths in 
adults with cardiac disease  (Paridon et al., 2006) .  There is literature to suggest that p atients with 
mutatio ns in RYR1 are susceptible to exertional rhabdomy olysis  or heatstroke with extreme 
exercise. We will not be having the patients do extreme exercise, but will take precautions to be ready to prevent this . See “Subject Monitoring” for further details.  
 EIM:  This procedure is non- invasive, but there may be slight discomfort (pressure) with the 
placement of the electrode on the skin.  
24 
  
MRI: Participants are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, brain stimulators, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pi[INVESTIGATOR_32284], heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel  
fragments. Welders and metal workers are also at risk for injury because of possible small metal fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware. Individuals will be screened for these conditions before having any scan, and if they have any, they will not receive an MRI scan.  In addition, all magnetic objects (for example, watches, coins, jewelry, and credit cards) must be removed before entering the MRI scan room. This risk also applies to healthy volunteers.  
 Participants with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those with back problems or significant contractures may have pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner. The noise from the scanner is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in participants who already have hearing l oss. Everyone having a MRI scan will be fitted with hearing protection. There are 
no known long -term risks of MRI scans. Participants may learn pregnancy status through 
required pregnancy testing.  
 Physical therapy: 6 Minute Walk, Motor Function Measure32, timed tests , and Myotools tests  
are patient self -limiting tests with minimal risk and discomfort.  Participants may become 
fatigued.  
 Biodex:  Biodex may produce strain on the heart, muscle s, and joints. The following 
contraindications will be ruled out prior to proceeding with Biodex: history of CAD and/or 
valvular disease, hypertension (>140/90), aneurysm, severe osteoporosis (BMD > -2.[ADDRESS_31474] 
deviations and history of pathological fracture), acute spr ain or strain, unstable joint/bone, knee 
pain, quadriceps tendonitis, moderate- severe joint effusion, extremely limited joint range of 
motion, severe pain, soft tissue healing constraints, unable to follow commands appropriately, 
unable to perform desired motion.  BP  would be taken immediately prior to testing to confirm 
appropriate parameters.  
 
Arterial Occlusion Muscle Oxygenation Capacity Test:  The only known risk associated with arterial occlusion is discomfort. This procedure will not be performed on individuals who have disorders predisposing them to thrombosis , as a precaution. Arterial occlusion has been 
performed in patients with various myopathies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and there were no reported adverse events (Sander et al., 2000).  There are no published data  to our 
knowledge regarding  the incidence of  a clot being formed or dislodged due to this procedure. 
However, due to the nature of the procedure, this is a theoretical risk.  Thus, we are excluding subjects with disorders pre disposing them to thrombosis , as a precaution .  This risk also applies 
to healthy volunteers.  
 Phlebotomy: Participants may have some discomfort and bruising at the site of needle entry. There is a very small risk of fainting. Infection in the area of the needle insertion is rare.  This risk also 
applies to healthy volunteers.  
 Genetic Testing: Risks of sharing genomic data may include the possibility of re -identification.  
25 
  
Saliva collection: There are minimal risks associated with saliva collection.  This also applies to 
healthy volunteers.  
 
Urine collection: T here are minimal known risks associated with urine collection.  This also applies 
to healthy volunteers.  
 
Urine pregnancy test : there is a risk that a pregnancy test will be positive  and this will be 
upsetting to the participant or the parent of the participant , if a minor.  A clinician will be present 
the results to the participant and be available for any questions.  
 Photographs/videos: Risks are minimal. The patient may be identif ied if a face is featured. When 
possible, the patient’s face and other identifying marks will not be included in the recording or photograph in order to protect confidentiality. This also applies to healthy volunteers.  
 
Qualitative interviews and/or questionnaires: The interviews and questionnaires are not harmful, 
but they may be frustrating or stressful. There may be some ps ychological distress associated 
with answering personal questions .  None of the questionnaires query thoughts of harm to self or 
others.  However, some of the questions ask the participants about depression, anxiety and anger 
and these responses may not be viewed by [CONTACT_32351]. If upon review of 
the answers, the investigators feel there exists a possibility of a psychiatric diagnosis, the  adult or  
parent, in the case of a minor, will be contact[CONTACT_32352] a referral to a psychiatric professional in their area.   
 
Muscle ultrasound: Muscle ultrasound is not harmful. Participants may experience some slight 
discomfort from having to stay still during the procedure  or may experience discomfort from the 
coldness of the gel .  This risk also applies to healthy volunteers.  
 
Muscle biopsy: The muscle punch -biopsy procedure has potential risks including infection, 
bleeding, pain, and post -procedure anesthesia or paresthesia if a cutaneous nerve is damaged. The 
risk of these events is minimized by [CONTACT_32353].  
 
Drug Administration:  Please see next section.  
 Phone calls  and email correspondence: Minimal risk.  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_692] : Minimal risk.  
  Provide the incidence/frequency of adverse effects, if known  
 When administered as oral effervescent tablets , NAC has few severe side effects, providing a 
favorable risk benefit ratio to the proposed trial ( Tirouvanziam et al, 2006;  Hardan  et al. , 2012). 
Side effects of PharmaNAC  effervescent tablets, which we plan to administer, inclu de diarrhea, 
nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and flatulence , particularly when used 
chronically in high doses  up to 6.9g/day .  The dosage  (2700mg /day)  for our study is within the 
26 
 range of dosages previously used in clinical trials  and is considered high. If the participants, at 
any point in the study, should need to take antibiotics, they will be informed to take their 
antibiotic medication (penicillins, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides) at least two hours prior to taking  NAC. Other drugs that interact with NAC  and GSH include, 
nitroglycerine , carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_32285] , and acetaminophen for GSH . Use of these medications 
is exclusionary, and participants cannot have taken them within seven days of the start of the study. Participants will not stop taking prescription medications for the purposes of this study unless they can be safely discontinued.  In this case, the discontinuation will be done under the 
care of the prescr ibing physician.  It is important to note that high levels of NAC administration 
have not been tested in pregnant or lactating women, therefore, pregnancy is an exclusion criteria. As mentioned previously, if women become pregnant during this study, we will follow up with these women during their pregnancy and at birth.  
 Side effects reported when NAC is inhaled or injected  include  rhinorrhea, stomatitis, 
generalized  urticarial/facial flushing , rash, pruritis , headache,  drowsiness, clamminess,  chest 
tightness, bronchoconstriction, and  hypotension. Anaphylaxis is a rare but possible side effect in 
IV administered NAC in response to acetaminophen overdos e. However, we will not be 
admin istering NAC in the inhaled or IV routes, and there have been no reports  of anaphylaxis  
with oral administration.  
Reported side effects for FDA -approved prescription medications differ from those 
reported for over -the-counter oral supplements.  For example , the FDA -approved intravenous 
formulation of NAC has a side effect of prolonged bleeding (delayed blood clotting).  However, 
this side effect has not been reported for the dietary supplement of NAC.  Other side effects 
related to prescription formulations  of NAC, especially those that are intravenous, inhaled or 
injected, may be found in the literature and on the internet, but may not be applicable to the 
dietary supplement utilized in this study.  Participants are informed that they may find 
information a bout side effects related to NAC, which may in fact only  be related to other 
prescription formulations of the drug.  Participants  are expected to inform study investigators 
about any concerns they have regarding side effects for NAC found in outside source s.  
In a pediatric study by [CONTACT_32354]. (2006), 18 patients took the approximate dose 
in our proposed study using the same administration we plan to use (PharmaNAC effervescent 
tablets). 7/ 18 of these patients  had mild symptoms of heartburn (4 patients), bad taste (1 patient), 
flatulence (1 patient), and nausea (1 patient).  None of these symptoms required clinical monitoring. In another  pediatric study by [CONTACT_32355] (2012)  also using the PharmaNAC 
effervesce nt tablets , but through a higher dose range , thirty -three subjects (31 male subjects, 2 
female subjects; aged 3.2–10.7 years ) were randomized to receive NAC or placebo for [ADDRESS_31475] common adverse effects observed during the study were gastrointestinal and included nausea/vomiting, constipation, increased/decreased appetite and diarrhea (Hardan et al., 2012). We expect the same side effects in our pediatric population given that NAC is a precursor to the endogenous antioxidant GSH. W e do not suspect any specific side effects in myopathies given 
this mechanism of action.  
During the course of this study, one participant experienced rash and chest tightness with 
coughing, one participant experienced hives, one participant experienced tachycardia, two 
27 
 participants experienced hypotension, and some  participants experienced dehydration, dizziness, 
and/or headaches .  One participant  had a benign o varian cyst, which grew during the course of 
the study, including during the drug phase.  It is not known if these participants were on NAC or 
placebo .  
 
Steps taken to minimize risk 
 
In our proposed study, a fter participants receive drug or placebo effervescent tablets at 
the 6- month visit, they will be monitored at NIH for 2 consecutive days  as an extra precaution  to 
rule out rhinorrhea, stomatitis, urticarial/facial flushing, rash, pruritus , hives, coughing, 
headache, drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness, bronchoconstriction, and hypotension, which are the most severe potential side effects of inhaled or injected NAC . This monitoring will 
include being observed in the outpatient clinic for [ADDRESS_31476] our onsite nurses. A  Licensed Care Provider will th en call them at one and 
three weeks to monitor adverse reactions. We will then monitor participants  monthly (2, 3, 4, and 
5 months) by [CONTACT_32356]/or email , primarily  for gastrointestinal symptoms, which are the main  
symptoms of PharmaNAC  effervescent tablets . If a patient reports any of the side effects that 
have already been reported (rash, chest tightness with coughing, hives, or hypotension), they will 
be advised to stop taking the study medication immediately. They will only restart the study 
medication after discussing their symptoms with the PI.  Patients are also asked , in the consent 
form,  to limit their alcohol consumption to no more than [ADDRESS_31477] a possible allergic 
reaction or a seriou s or life -threatening emergency.  They are expected to tell the ER staff that 
they are in a research study and ask the emergency personnel call the research nurse.  
Participants are instructed to continue under the care of their local clinicians throughout  
participation.  Participants are provided with a “ NAC Information Letter for Clinicians ” 
(Appendix F) to share with their home clinicians.  This letter provides study drug information 
and information about possible side effects . 
If a patient reports Grade  [ADDRESS_31478], a ccording to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events v.3.0, we will discontinue their participation . If Grade 1 side effects 
are reported, we will monitor them by [CONTACT_32356]/or email  and keep them on the drug.  If Grade [ADDRESS_31479] resolves and then resume administration with careful observation for reoccurrence. Moni toring for grades 1 and 2 side 
effects  will include weekly phone calls and/or emails until symptoms subside. If symptoms 
worsen subjects will visit their primary care physician. Subjects who experience grade [ADDRESS_31480] us at any time with questions or concerns.  
We will offer an evaluation at NIH for any participant who would like to return for an 
evaluation of side effects, such as, but not limited to, local participants.  This evaluation will include a history and physical examination, discussion with the medical advisory investigator, 
28 
 and appropriate consults, for example a GI consult. 
An informational letter (Appendix F) to the participant’s physician will b e given to each 
subject to give to their primary care provider.  
 
8.  Subject Safety M onitoring 
For CPET, there is literature to suggest that participants with mutations in RYR1 are susceptible to exertional rhabdomyolysis  or heatstroke with extreme exercis e. We will not be having the 
patients do extreme exercise, but will take precautions to be ready to prevent these susceptibilities  just in case .  The precautions include having  the CPET performed in a cool room 
with a fan blowing on the patient , while moni toring the patient’s temperature .  We will ask the 
patient if they are experiencing crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], stiffness, or pain throughout the procedure.  If the answer is yes, or if their temperature exceeds [ADDRESS_31481] ed for myoglobin. If the patient is medically unwell, the patient 
will be admitted to the day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32286] h ydration. If the  
CK, potassium and urine myoglobin levels are elevated  suggestive of rhabdomyolysis , they will 
be treated with sodium bicarbonate  and monitored until the rhabdomy olysis is safely resolved.   
 Investigators will evaluate participants for any foreseeable safety concerns before stu dy 
procedures are performed.  Investigators will allow participants to miss individual procedures 
(other than the two primary outcome measures — urine collection  for 15 F2t -isoprostane  levels 
and 6MWT ), at one or all st udy visits , if safety concerns arise. Examples include: If a participant 
has a recent history of knee dislocation or knee injury, that participant will be excluded from the Biodex procedure.  If a participant has an increased risk of blood clotting, that participant will 
not perform the arterial occlusion test.  If a participant is at NIH and recently recovered from a 
rhabdomyolysis crisis, that participant will not perform CPET at that visit, but may perform 
CPET at following visits, if deemed safe at that time .  If a participant has certain types of metal 
in their body, that participant will not perform the MRI procedure at any visit. Investigators will 
ask participants about potential safety concerns for each procedure and participants are also 
asked to i nform study investigators about potential risk factors in the consent.  Investigators will 
have a participant miss certain non -primary outcome measure procedures, due to safety concerns, 
at their discretion.  Participants will remain enrolled in the study if they are able to safely 
perform the two primary outcome measures and are also able to safely consume the study medication/placebo, given the expected side effects.  [CONTACT_32387] can withdraw a participant, at any time, if she believes continuation is no t in their best medical interest, or if the participant is 
unable to comply with the study . 
 For monitoring for NAC administration, please see previous section under “Steps Taken to Minimize Risk”.  
 For other individual monitoring plans, please see previous section under “Steps Taken to 
Minimize Risk.”  
 
Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_32287]:  
If a patient reports Grade [ADDRESS_31482] withdrawal from the study  
If Grade 1 side effects are reported, we will monitor them by [CONTACT_17084]/or email  and 
keep them on the drug.  If Grade [ADDRESS_31483] resolves and then resume administration with careful observation for reoccurrence.  Please see Section 7 under “Steps Taken to Minimize Risks” for further details.

glutathione via mass spectrometry.   Needle muscle biopsy will be performed at six and twelve 
months on up to 20 willing adult participants only.   GSH: Mass spectrometry, fluorescent, and colorimetric assays will be used to measure levels of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG)  glutathione in plasma and whole blood to observe changes 
in oxidative stress.  These assays include deproteinization, derivatization, and/or catalytic reactions.   
 DCFH: As in the preliminary studies above, DCFH will be used on participant muscle biopsies to analyze intracellular oxidant activity [H2DCFDA (H2 -DCF,  DCF)].  
 15-isoprostane -F2: Urine will be assayed for 15- isoprostane -F2, which is formed when 
arachidonic acid reacts with ROS.  A validated GC -MS/MS method will be used to quantify 14-
isoprostane -F2. 
 Anaerobic threshold: A naerobic threshold and time to anaerobic threshold will be extrapolated 
from data obtained during CPET.

supi[INVESTIGATOR_32288], ascend 4 stairs, descend 4 stairs. They will be graded on an ordinal scale.  
 
Myotools: Force required for partic ipants to squeeze the grip dynamometer and pi[INVESTIGATOR_32289]. The best effort of 3 trials will be recorded for grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_32261]. 
 
Biodex:  Biodex will be used to test muscle groups using a dynamic sub -max fatigue test with a 
repetitive motion.  Blood pressure will be taken prior to testing to confirm the patient is not 
hypertensive (>140/90).  Outcome measures will include peak torque measured in newton meters and number of repetitions to 50% decline in peak torque. 
 
Arterial Occlusion Muscle Oxy genation Capacity Test:  The tissue saturation index will be 
calculated as TOI= [O2 -Hb] / Tot -Hb. The rate of decline and rise in TOI  will be the main 
muscle tissue saturation measures.  
 MFM: The final outcome is a percentage based score of each domain and the total score.  
 PROMIS, FACIT, MFI, NeuroQoL :  Questionnaires will be  scored based on each scale’s 
requirements .

10.  Statistical Analysis  
 a.  Analysis of data/ study outcomes  
 Natural history study (Phase 1 of protocol) : 
 
During  the natural history phase  of the study, we will take one look at the data prior to the final 
analysis with the following two approaches:  
1) After [ADDRESS_31486] healthy  individuals. This 
analysis will be repeated when all bas eline visits are completed.   
 Hypothesis : 15- F2t-isoprostane  will be significantly increased  in RYR1 -RM myopathy 
patients compared to healthy individuals . 
 Hypothesis: 6MWT distance will be significantly decreased in RYR1- RM patients 
 compared to healthy individuals .  
2) After 30 participants complete their 2nd visit at 6 months (prior to starting study 
drug/placebo), disease progression will be assessed using paired t -tests to determine 
changes between 0 and 6 month visits for each outcome measure. For the primary 
outcome measures, 15- F2t-isoprostane  and 6MWT will be assessed for change between 0 
and 6 months. This analysis will be repeated when all 6 month visits are completed.  
 Hypothesis : 15- F2t-isoprostane  concentration will not change significantly betw een 
 0 and 6 months in RYR1 -RM myopathy patient s. 
 Hypothesis: 6MWT distance will not change  significantly  between 0 and 6 months  in 
 RYR1 -RM patients.  
 The purpose of the above interim look analyses (under #1) is to confirm that the affected subjects are different from healthy individuals. Because of the rolling nature of the study and the length of time involved to complete the first phase of the study, this allows evaluate whether these outcomes are different from healthy individuals, as expected, in or der to confidently proceed 
with the study. The purpose of the above interim look analysis (under #2) is to characterize the natural history and variability of the RYR1- RM patients for these specific outcome measures and 
to contribute novel data to the fiel d of RYR1 as soon as possible for future trial design, given 
that an N of [ADDRESS_31487].  Correlative analysis (Pearson correlation and/or Spearman rho) will be used to examine the linear relationship between subjective fatigue measures (FACIT and MFI) and the salivary fatigue biomarker to the obj ective fatigability measures mentioned above as well as to compare 
forced vital capacity to slow vital capacity. Spearman rho correlation, Pearson correlation and or Bland Altman analysis will also be used to examine the relationship between slow vital cap acity 
and forced vital capacity.  
Reliability will be assessed for PROMIS, FACIT, MFI, MFM, and NeuroQoL by [CONTACT_32358]’s 
alpha  for internal consistency  and by [CONTACT_32359] -retest . If the test -
[ADDRESS_31488] analysis yields a poor correlation (ICC<0.40), then the scales will not be used in the study 
since they are not primary outcome measures. However, if they yield moderate to high correlation, we will use the scales throughout the entire study.  
 
Randomized, double -blind, placebo c ontrolled, drug trial  (Phase 2  of protocol) : 
Student’s t test will be used to compare treatment to control groups . As mentioned in the 
Introduction, under “Summary”, s uccess of the trial will be defined as finding a significant 
difference in the primary ox idative stress measure of of urine 15- F2t-isoprostane  between the 
treatment and placebo groups at the termination of the study  (significantly decreased urine 15 -
F2t-isoprostane concentration in treatment group compared to placebo group) .  A sub group 
analysis will be performed on adults versus children given the difference in dosing. A paired t 
test will be used  to compare subjects to their baseline values . A student’s t test will be used to 
compare the difference in glutathione between 6 m onths and 12 months , between the two groups. 
General linear modeling will be used to control for possible confounders such as gender, age, 
and baseline values . Log transformed values may be used if there is no bell curve. We w ill use  an 
alpha of 0.05 to de termine significance.   
 We will use the Grounded Theory Method (GTM) of data analysis to analyze the semi - 
structured interview data. GTM methodically organizes unique individual experiences collected during interviews into comparable categories so that it becomes possible to find commonalities 
as well as variations in personal experiences. We use GTM because it is particularly effective for 
analyzing qualitative interview data and because it is rigorous. A GTM approach is appropriate 
when there is limited knowledge about a substantive area,  such as the fatigue  and quality of life 
of individuals with RYR1 -related myopathy . 
 
Select patients will undergo  exome sequencing as, occasionally,  patients with RYR1 -related 
myopathies with identical RYR1  mutations have  different phenotypes. Exome sequencing may 
help identify the cause of  this difference. B ecause the RyR1 protein interacts with numerous 
other proteins , the genes encoding these other proteins may be modifiers of severity.  Patients 
will be selected for exome analysis if they have the same mutations but have a difference of 
greater than 10% on the MFM32 score. A candidate gene approach will be taken to sequence the 
genes encoding these other proteins , to evaluate whether  they  have SNPs or mutations that affect 
severity . Using the exome, additional mutations in RYR1  as causative for the phenotypic 
difference will be ruled out prior to looking at other candidate genes. Genes that encode proteins without a known function in relat ion the RyR1 protein will not be interrogated so as to avoid 
unintentional incidental findings.  
 Healthy volunteer data:  
In the first phase of the study, results will be obtained from healthy controls for the 
biomarker s, NIRS , muscle ultrasound, and MRI .  An age -matched analysis will be performed  to 
compare healthy volunteer data to patient data for these outcome measures . We will use an alpha 
of 0.05 to determine significance.  For the comparison to healthy volunteers, age -matched 
participants will be used .  Please see inclusion criteria under healthy volunteers for age groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
b.  Power analysis  
Sample size:  
33 
 This is a randomized controlled trial with two groups: NAC and Control. For sample size 
planning purposes, we have used glutathione data, pre and post NAC treatment,  from an HIV 
population ( Muller et al. 2000) . Assuming the NAC treatment group will have a delta (post -
treatment glutathione – pre -treatment glutathione) of 1.[ADDRESS_31489] deviation of 2.80, for a 2- sided 
alpha of 0.05 and 80% power we will need 38 patients per group ([ADDRESS_31490] of 
equal means and unequal variances).  
We need [ADDRESS_31491] 24 drop outs , 
per group.  Therefore, our accrual ceiling for all participants is 2 00.  
 
The primary analysis  will be an intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis, i.e. all randomized participants will 
be included in the analysis. The mechanism for missing data will be evaluated. If missing data are unrelated to the intervention or primary outcome (i.e. missing completely at random or missing at random), the analysis will be based on multiple imputations (20 -40 imputed datasets, 
depending on the extent of the missing data) with a pooled average of the 20- [ADDRESS_31492] completed the trial,  i.e., 
when  40% of our potentially achievable accrual  reach Month 12.  
 
For the sample size reevaluation, and based on the observe d data so far, we will calculate the 
following: the control group delta and its standard deviation and the standard deviation of the delta for the active arm. Based on these observed parameter values  for urine 15 -F2t-isoprostane , 
we will re -calculate the s ample size and compare it to the current N=76.  
 Based on O’Brien -Fleming boundary calculations ( O'Brien  and Fleming, 1979), the interim 
analysis will result in one of 3  actions:  
1. If there is strong indication of no benefit of NAC in de creasing  [ADDRESS_31493] is greater than 3.36, we will 
consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_32290].  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_32291], decrease excess costs, and provide a potential t reatment sooner for this rare disease, 
which currently has no treatment . 
 The primary outcome measure is being changed, initially due to pi[INVESTIGATOR_32292]. Additional review of our data at Emory after sending a second batch of samples and 
34 
 further literature review identified further justification for ch anging the primary oxidative stress 
biomarker from glutathione (GSH) to 15- Ft2-isoprostane:  
 
--The processing of GSH and its oxidized form GSSG often results in methodological 
artifacts. For instance, sample acidification for protein precipi[INVESTIGATOR_32293]:GSSG ratio (Marrocco et al. 2017). The assay is 
sensitive to exposure to air/time and sample volume and is therefore prone to error. The aforementioned methodological artifacts are not unique to this protocol  and have been 
described previously (McGill et al. 2015). 
 
--During the current protocol, such methodological issues arose at Emory in addition to 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32294]. For example, when the second sample for each patient was rerun at Emory , including samples unaffected by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_32295], the 
results between the first patient and second patient sample were unreliable. These methodological errors in GSH as a biomarker and the recurrent, significant time delays for processing by [CONTACT_32361], in a ddition to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_32295], prompted a change in primary 
outcome measure from GSH to 15- Ft2-isoprostane. 
 
--15- Ft2-isoprostane was collected on each individual at each visit as a secondary 
outcome measure for oxidative stress throughout the life of the protocol. The change from GSH to 15- Ft2-isoprostane  is being made prior to treatment allocation un -blinding 
and prior to statistical analyses, which is the optimal time to change a primary endpoint when such a change is required (Evans, 2007). Changes in pr imary endpoints are 
reported in approximately 30% of clinical trials (Ramagopalan, 2014).  
 --Elevated oxidative stress is a hallmark pathological feature in RYR1 -RM and has been 
identified in several pre -clinical models of the disease (Durham et al. 2008, Dowling et 
al. 2012, Lee et al. 2017, Michelucci et al., 2017). In particular, lipid peroxidation of mitochondrial membranes has been implicated as a central pathomechanism that leads to severe mitochondrial dysfunction and/or death in the RYR1Y522S/W mous e model 
(Durham et al. 2008). Notably, treatment of the aforementioned mice with N -
acetylcysteine (NAC), (ad lib via drinking water for 8 weeks) rescued lipid peroxidation and concomitantly prevented previously observed decrements in force generation (Durh am et al., 2008). These findings have recently been supported by a 
longer -term study of NAC treatment in the same mouse model in which NAC treatment 
led to a decreased number of structural cores and improved skeletal muscle function (Michelucci et al., 201 7).  
 
--15- F2t-isoprostane has been reported as the most reliable in vivo biomarker of oxidative 
stress and is a measure of lipid peroxidation (Milne et al. 2007, van 't Erve et al., 2017). Moreover, a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 15- F2t-isoprostane concentration has been esta blished through 
substantial data collection from otherwise healthy volunteers (n= 1881) allowing comparisons to be made to disease populations (van 't Erve et al., 2017). Finally, when our participants’ baseline and 6 month (untreated) isoprostane levels w ere compared, 
the findings were not significantly different, suggesting reliability of this biomarker in our population, in contrast to our GSH data analysis of the same time points. 
 
[ADDRESS_31494] ing GSH 
concentrations, NAC supplementation (2 × 600 mg, twice daily, for 30 days) led to a 
22% reduction in 15- F2t-isoprostane concentration and improved exercise performance 
(Paschalis et al. 2017). These findings are pertinent for this protocol as it ha s been 
demonstrated pre -clinically that RYR1 -RM models have low resting GSH 
concentrations, and both 15- F2t-isoprostane concentration and improved exercise 
performance are being tested in our trial. Additional antioxidant clinical trials have also shown a beneficial effect of treatment on 15 -F2t-isoprostane concentration. In 
particular, an α -tocopherol (vitamin E) antioxidant trial in smokers (n= 81 placebo; n= 
82 vitamin E) demonstrated that consuming 400 IU vitamin E daily resulted in a statistically sign ificant (21%) difference in corrected urinary F2 -isoprostane 
concentration compared to placebo following 32- months treatment (Guertin et al. 
2016). 
            In combination, these findings strengthen the rationale for using 15- F2t-isoprostane 
concentrati on as the primary outcome measure for this protocol in place of GSH. The sample 
size recalculation for [ADDRESS_31495] selection for healthy volunteers will be equitable.  
 b.  Justification for inclusion of children  
Children age 7 years old and older are affected with this disease and are affected with fatigue. 
This drug in this route of administration has a good safety profile in children at this dose for 
other indications. Children < 7 years of age will be excluded as they will not be able to follow t he 
commands in order to perform all of the outcome measures.  
Healthy volunteer children are needed to provide age -matched groups as controls for biomarkers , 
NIRS , muscle ultrasound , and MRI . 
 
c.  Justification for exclusion of other vulnerable subjects  
Those unable to provide consent  due to cognitive issues  will be excluded , due to the requirement 
to be able to respond to questionnaires such as  PROMIS and FACIT . 
 
36 
 d.  Justification of sensitive procedures (use of placebo)  
The use of a placebo is necessary t o determine the effects of NAC on this population.  Without 
the placebo, we would not be able to determine if NAC has a significant effect on participants 
with RYR1 -RM.  Use of a placebo will allow us to draw stronger conclusions about the effects 
of NAC t han if we conducted the study without a placebo.  
 e.  Safeguards for vulnerable populations  (e.g. DPA, pregnancy testing, contraception use, 
ethics consult, HSPU involvement)  
Safeguards:  Protections for employees and staff participating in this study include 1) assuring that the participation or refusal to participate will have no effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the subject’s employment or position at the NIH, 2) giving employees and staff who are interested in participating the “NIH Information Sheet on Employee Research Participation (Appendix L )” prior to obtaining consent, 3) assuring that there will be no direct solicitation of 
employees or staff , and, 4) Independent consent m onitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_32362].  
 
This study collects sensitive information on pregnancy status, which will be in the participant’s 
NIH medical record. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_32296]- workers through staff discussions and written 
branch/section procedures.  All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible, limiting personnel present.  
 
For pediatric patients, we will have parental consent and minor assent. Pediatric staff and 
pediatric equipment will be used. During blood draws, a local anesthetic cream such as Eutectic 
Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) may  be used to minimize the pain for young children. For 
pediatric participants , no more than 5 mL/kg will be drawn in a single day, and no more than 9.5 
mL/kg will be drawn over any eight -week period.  
 
Blood will not be drawn on participants if they are known to be anemic (Hgb < 8 gm/dl) per medical history, or if their medical con dition causes an investigator to believe that blood drawing 
might be detrimental to the participant.  
 
Parents can accompany their child to the MRI suite and watch their child through a window during the procedure. During the procedures, there will be music and/or video to distract the child.  All participants will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times.  
 For women of childbearing age, we will do pregnancy testing to e xclude women who are 
pregnant at the beginning of the study . We will also exclude women who are breastfeeding. 
Women who are sexu ally active will require contraception. Acceptab le contraception includes 
barrier methods (contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, female and male condoms), hormonal methods (oral contraceptives, the patch, shot/injection, and vaginal ring), implantable devices (implantable rods and intrauterine devices), and permanent birth control methods (sterilization implant and surgical sterilization).

[ADDRESS_31496] benefit to adult and pediatric participants in the 
study drug group, such as reducing oxida tive stress, fatigue, and fatig ability.  Reduced 
39 
 oxidative stress decreases cellular necrosis and improves energy efficiency. In turn, this 
would allow the participants to improve their energy level . (Hybertson et al., 2011) 
Additionally, improved energy efficiency translates to reducing fatigabi lity, thereby 
[CONTACT_32363], which was noted by [CONTACT_32364]., in the RYR1 zebrafish model with NAC administration.  
There will be no benefit for healthy volunteers.  
 
13.  Classification of R isk (for the study as a whole)  
 a.  For adults : More than minimal risk  
 b.  For Adults without consent capacity (not applicable)  
 c.  For Children  (Patients):  45CFR46.[ADDRESS_31497] benefit to the individual child For Children (Healthy Volun teers) : 45CFR46.[ADDRESS_31498] completed the 
NIMH HSPU “Elements of Successful Informed Consent” training.  Assent will be obtained 
from minor subjects. 
 
b.  Consent procedures  
All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures , and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. 
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions regarding this study prior to si gning.  Written assent will be obtained, when possible, 
from minors age 7 and older.  Minors who reach age 18 while enrolled will be consented as 
adults for continued participation. 
 
If eligible, the subjects will undergo an in -person written consent  at NIH. During the consent 
process, the child and  custodial parent will sign the consent form.  The original consent form will 
be filed in the participant’s NIH chart. A copy of the completed signed consent will be returned 
to the participant. The consenting investigator will document the consent procedure in the NIH medical record.  
 
For pediatric patients, i f the parents are married, written consent may be obtained from one 
parent only.  For pediatric healthy volunteers, consent from both parents is  required, even if 
parents are married. If the parents are not married, written consent will be obtained from: 1) the 
40 
 custodial parent if only one parent has legal custody, or 2) from both parents if they share legal 
custody for medical decision -making. For unmarried parents, signature [CONTACT_32375], unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available. When signature [CONTACT_32376], written consent will be obtained in- person from at least one 
parent. When the sec ond parent is unable to attend the consent process conference in person, the 
following telephone process to obtain written consent will be used.   
 Telephone Consent Procedures: The unavailable parent will be provided with a copy of the 
consent form, usual ly by [CONTACT_6791], email, or hard copy mail.  Once the consent form is received, an 
Investigator authorized to obtain consent will arrange for a telephone call with the parent in the 
presence of a witness to review study and the consent form and to answer any ques tions. If the 
parent cannot arrange for a witness in his/her location, the consenting investigator will have a 
witness present for the teleconference at NIH.  Once the parent agrees to his/her child’s 
participation, the parent and witness (if present with the parent) will sign and date their copy of 
the consent form. The Investigator will enter a note documenting the consent process in the Medical Record. The 2nd parent will return their signed copy to the Investigator. Once the copy 
with the parent signature [CONTACT_32377], the Investigator and witness (if present at NIH) will sign 
and date the 2nd parent consent form, place the original copy with all signatures in the Medical 
Record, retain a copy for research records, and mail a copy to the parent.   
 
The telephone consent  process  described above may be used  to obtain written re -consent  from 
participants who are already enrolled . Written informed consent will be obtained from minor 
participants when they reach the age of consent for continued use of their samples or data.  The 
telephone consent procedure detailed above may be used for such consent.  
 
For NIH employees: Consent may be obtained by a co -worker.  If so, i ndependent consent 
monitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_32362]. 
 
c.  Consent documents   
The consent contains all required elements.  The consents attached to the protocol include adult 
patient and healthy volunteer populations  (or parent of minor participants ) and two different 
minor assent s (ages 7 -13 and 14- 17), both for patients and healthy volunteers.   
 
15.  Data and Safety M onitoring 
       A n independent  monitor ing committee  will be put into place  for Phase 2 of the study , 
including three experts in the field of neurology.  
 
This committee will meet once every 3 months after the start of Phase 2 and is comprised of:  
 Andrew Mammen, MD, PhD, NIAMS, Muscle Disease Unit Leader, specializes in patients with myositis and autoimmune toxic myopathies and muscular dystrophies.  
 Ronald Cohn, MD, University of Toronto, is the Chief of Clinical and Metabolic Genetics at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32298].  
 Joan Austin, PhD, University of Indiana, Professor of Nursing at U. Indiana and specializes in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_32299].  She has served on Data and Safety 
Monitoring Boards for 2 national trials and a number in Indiana.  
41 
  
a.  Data and s afety monitor   
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_32300] 1 of the study  and by a n independent 
monitoring  committee for Phase 2 . 
 
b.  Data and safety monitoring plan  
Parameters to be monitored include liver function tests at the baseline visit and gastrointestinal symptoms throughout the 2
nd phase of the study.  
 
Liver Function Testing (L FT) in patients with RYR1 -RM: LFTs are often elevated in our patient 
population.  In patients with neuromuscular disease, the following criteria must be met, in order to determine impaired liver function.  These guidelines will be used for determining impa ired 
liver function in patients with RYR1 -RM.  
Evidence of moderate to severe hepatic involvement in this patient population is defined as:  
 
ALT ≥ 8x upper limit of normal (ULN) with total bilirubin 2x ULN (plus >35% ‘direct’ 
bilirubin)  and/or INR >1.5  
 or  
GGT > [ADDRESS_31499] (plus >35% ‘direct’ bilirubin) and/or  INR >1.5  
 
An increase to >[ADDRESS_31500], ALP and/or GGT, not 
observed pre -drug/placebo, will be reported . A change in the transaminases ( ALT, AST, 
ALP or GGT) from normal elevation for our popu lation per its natural history, which is < 3X 
ULN,  plus any increase in INR>1.5 or total bilirubin>2X ULN will trigger the action of 
immediate consultation with the MAI, [CONTACT_32389] regarding a dec ision of withdrawal 
of the patient. If [CONTACT_32389] is unavailable, [CONTACT_32390], [CONTACT_32391], [CONTACT_32392] or [CONTACT_32393] will be consulted. If medical consultation results in the decision to withdraw, the patient will be withdrawn immediately.   
 
c.  C riteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_32301] -related SAE,  the study will be  stopped  in that subject. T he SAE  will be 
reported  immediately (as soon as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32302]) to the IMC and IRB , and  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32303] w their instructions on what research activities can proceed or need to be stopped.  For the 
second same related SAE, the study will be temporarily stop ped, including research activity with 
enrolled participants , until IRB review, unless the IRB specifically permits certain research 
activity to continue.  
 
The IMC , in consultation with the IRB, will review  the data, unblinded if necessary, and will 
recommend whether to restart  the intervention.  
 
16.  Quality Assurance  
 
16.1        Quality assurance monitor  
42 
 As per the “National Institute of Nursing Research Intramural Research Program Policy on Data 
and Safety Monitoring (3/1/12)” Section IV D #5, the NINR Clinical Director will designate trained staff to monitor the progress of a clinical protocol. 
 16.[ADDRESS_31501] udy will follow guidelines noted in the “National 
Institute of Nursing Research Intramural Research Program Policy on Data and Safety Monitoring (3/1/12)” Section IV H #1 and be monitored at the following intervals: within 3- [ADDRESS_31502] annual interim monitoring, and as needed.  
 17.  Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events and Protocol Deviations  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_28874], documenting, and reporting unanticipated 
problems, adverse  events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), and deviations in 
accordance with NIH policy, IRB requirements, and federal regulations. Relatedness to the 
research of all serious adverse events will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_32304].  
 An electronic spreadsheet (Appendix K) is saved on the investigators’ secure shared drive, which 
tracks and records when each AE  occurred, when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32305], whether the 
event is unexpected ( with regard to information in the protocol, consent forms , and literature ), 
whether the event is at least possibly related to the research, whether the event increased the risk to participants beyond that previously known or undermined the integrity of study data, how the 
event was managed, whe ther/when and how the event resolved, and required reporting for the 
event.  Each AE will be reviewed with the IMM, Bryan Traynor, MD.  Bryan J. Traynor, MD, PhD, is a tenured investigator in the Neurogenetics Branch of the National Institute of Aging 
(NIA) and is an adult neurologist. He is currently the chief of the Neuromuscular Diseases 
Research Section of the NIA.  [CONTACT_32390] serves as the Independent Medical Monitor (IMM) 
for this protocol and will review each AE with the PI.  H e is an investigat or not authorized to 
obtain informed consent.  Further investigation of AEs will be directed to the MAI, as needed.  
AEs will be reported to the IMC, regardless of PI [CONTACT_2241] .  All adverse events will also be 
submitted to and reviewed immediately by  [CONTACT_32365].  All events will be 
submitted to the IMC for review. Communication to and from the medical monitors will be in 
writing.  
 Serious unanticipated problems, serious adverse events (including deaths) that are not unanticipated probl ems, and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and CD as 
soon as possible and in writing not more than [ADDRESS_31503] learns of the event.  Written reports will be submitted in PTMS.  
 
To avoid deviation reports for anticipated missed visits/procedures  
 
It is anticipated that participants in this study will occasionally miss or fail to complete an assessment or 
43 
 procedure, due to issues such as discomfort, a medical contraindication, or fail ure to complete a procedure 
or visit within protocol -specified time frames.  Omissions such as these of non- primary outcome 
measures will be considered expected events and not protocol deviations provided they are infrequent and 
do not include data needed to ass ess safety or the primary study outcome.   Cumulative proportions of 
these missed events in the study population will be presented to the IRB annually. In addition, the rate of omissions will be monitored by [CONTACT_32366]. If an individual misses more t han 15% of the required 
assessments/procedures or if more than 15% of the participants miss completion of the same assessment 
or procedure, it will be considered a deviation and a deviation report will be sent to the IRB within two 
weeks.   
 
If the total nu mber of expected items (study visits, study assessments/procedures) is less than 16, then two 
or more missed items are reportable. If the total number of expected items is greater than 16, then, if more 
than 15% are missed, it is reportable.   
 
All adverse events, deviations, and unanticipated problems will be summarized and reported at 
the time of Continuing Review.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_32306] 21 CFR 312.64(b) and as agreed upon with the sponsor. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_32307] 14 days.  
 
18.  Alternatives to Participation  
Because this study is a clinical trial to determine the effects of NAC on patients with RYR1 -
related myopathy, it is necessary for subjects in  the trial to take NAC or placebo.  Patients may 
not take NAC prescribed by [CONTACT_32367]. For patients who do not wish 
to take NAC or placebo or who wish to take it by [CONTACT_32368], the alternative is to not 
participate in the  trial.   There are no therapeutic alternatives.  
For healthy volunteers, the alternative is to not participate.  
 19. Privacy  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible, limiting personnel 
present.  
 
 20.  Confidentiality  
 
a.  For research data and investigator medical records : see below  for research data.  Medical 
records will be stored in CRIS and CTDB behind the NIH  firewall . For photographs and videos, 
when possible, the patient’s face and other identifying marks will not be included in the 
recording or photograph in order to protect confidentiality. Electronic records, videotapes, photographs, and other data, such as MRI sca n data, will be stored on encrypted, password 
protected servers only accessible by [CONTACT_32369].  Coded medical history will be stored in CTSS.   PROMIS and NeuroQol  data will be entered directly by 
[CONTACT_32370], which is also behind the NIH firewall.  Samples sent to 
other universities, such as U. Toronto and Emory, will be de -identified.  Samples sent to other 
universities  for fee -for-service analyses , such as Vanderbilt and Emory Universities , will be de -
identified.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_32308]- workers through staff discussions and written branch/section 
procedures.   
44 
  
b.  For stored samples : Stored samples will be ke pt behind a double lock or will be coded and 
kept behind a single lock. 
 
c.  Special precautions   
Samples and dat a will be stored using codes that we assign. Data will be kept in password-
protected computers.  Samples will be kept in locked storage. Only study investigators will have access to the samples and data.  
 For hard copy data/records: Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_32309] a participant identification key.  All participant data will be coded for the purpose of data analysis and sharing between listed investigators.  
 For samples without identifiers (coded or unlinked):  s ingle lock  will be used.     
 For electronic data with identifiers or recognizable facial images: password protected 
files on secured servers  will be used. Quantitative data in the form of results of rehabilitation 
medicine testing and responses to questionnaires will be stored in excel, SPSS, and/or Mplus 
files on encrypted computers at the same sites. Qualitative data (digital recordings) in the form of 
responses to open ended questions will be collected and retained on encrypted computers at NIH 
on Nvivo software (office s of [CONTACT_32387] ’s team , NINR). Recordings of qualitative  data will be 
destroyed once the study is completed. Data will be submitted to an  online database behind the 
NIH firewall (CTDB).  
 Only investigators listed on the protocol will have  access to records, data, and samples.  If 
sponsors, monitors or auditors outside of study investigators will need access , they will have 
access to coded  data.  Results will be posted on cctrials.gov  
 
21. Conflict of Interest  
 
a.   Distribution of NIH Guidelines  
NIH guidelines on conflict of interest have been distributed to all investigators.   
 
b.  Conflict of interest  
There are no conflicts -of-interest to report for NIH investigators.  Non- NIH investigators will 
abide by [CONTACT_32371] -of-interest policies of their own institutions.  We have consulted with DEC 
and there are no conflicts of interest for [CONTACT_32380] or Hyperion.  
 
c.  Role  of a commercial compa ny or sponsor   
BioAdvantex Pharma Inc will provide complementary  drug (PharmaNAC) and placebo oral 
effervescent pi[INVESTIGATOR_32310] .  Under a non- disclosure agreement, t he company will also  
disclose information regarding description and composition of the drug product and placebo, 
certificate of analysis and the master production document certificate that contains information 
about manufacturing, packaging and quality assurance for both NAC and place bo. BioAdvantex 
has granted  permission to cross reference drug master file for NAC and environmental analysis 
requirement certification. NIH and University of Toronto will provide the protocol and the results 
of the study to BioAdvantex .  Personal identifi ers of participants will not be shared with the 
sponsor.  
45 
 22. Technology Transfer  
An MTA (MTA -15-002) is in place with [CONTACT_32380] at Hyperion Biotechnology Inc., which 
states that deidentified data will be owned by [CONTACT_32372], but the salivary fatigue biomarker  will be 
processed at Hyperion. MTAs have been obtained to transfer de -identified muscle tissue samples 
and de -identified genetic mutations to [CONTACT_32384] at Columbia University.  
A CTA (NR -CTA -15-001) has been started with BioAdvantex Pharma. The CTA st ates that 
BioAdvantex Pharma will provide the drug, but the NINR is responsible for sponsoring the 
study, and [CONTACT_32387] is the sponsor of the IND. An MTA is not required for sending to samples on a fee- for-service basis to Vanderbilt and Emory Universit ies. 
 
 
23. Research and Travel Compensation  
Patients:  
Lodging , meals and travel will be provided to patients only  by [CONTACT_32373] .  In the case of minors  
or adults who have difficulty traveling alone due to their myopathy , NINR will also pay for 
travel and lodging for one caregiver. In the case of minors, the caregiver will be the legal 
guardian. There will be no other payment or reimbursement.  Meal vouchers will be provided to 
the adult patient or the parent of a minor  (for the child’s meals) . 
For pati ents who are staying in a hotel off campus, complementary shuttles are available between 
their hotel and NIH.  If patients are at NIH after these routine shuttles have stopped for the day, 
taxis will be provided for them, and covered under the protocol.  N INR staff will arrange the 
taxi.  Research study staff will be present after late- day procedures, if needed, to assure 
transportation needs are addressed . 
NIH employees or staff who participate during work hours must have permission from their 
supervisor. NIH employees or staff must either participate outside of work hours or take leave in 
order to receive compensation. 
 
Healthy Volunteers : 
Travel  and meals  will be provided to volunteers by [CONTACT_32373].  In the case of minors, NINR will 
also pay for travel and meals for one legal guardian. Only healthy volunteers will be paid for 
their participation. Each volunteer will be provided with $50 compensation.  For those undergoing an MRI, an additional $[ADDRESS_31504] stay the night in order to participate, 
one night of lodging will be provided to the participant and their legal guardian (in the case of minors).   For volunteers  who are staying in a hotel off campus, complementary shuttles are available 
between their hotel and NIH.  If volunteers  are at NIH after these routine shuttles have stopped 
for the day, taxis will be provided for them, and covered under the protocol.  NINR staff will arrange the taxi.   Research study staff will be present after late -day procedures, if needed, to 
assure transportation needs are addressed.  
NIH employees or staff who participate during work hours must have permission from their supervisor. NIH employees or staff must either participate outside of work hours or take leave in order to receive compensation.

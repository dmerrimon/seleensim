Indication  locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer  
 
Study Overview  The treatment options for locally advanced and metastatic 
pancreatic cancer remain limited with poor survival1,2.  As 
such, there is a great need for further drug development.  In 
the previous phase II second -line trial the combination of 
Eryaspase plus gemcitabine or Eryaspase plus FOLFOX (5 -
fluorouracil [5 -FU], leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) was superior 
to that of chemotherapy alone3.   
 
Given this preliminary efficacy signal, this trial is designed to 
determine safety and perhaps an even larger signal of 
efficacy in the first -line setting.  FOLFIRINOX is the standard 
of care for the first -line treatment of patien ts with advanced 
disease worldwide and thus supports our first line design in 
combination with Eryaspase.  
 
Eryaspase is a dispersion for infusion of allogenic 
erythrocytes encapsulating recombinant E . coli L -
asparaginase, in a saline preservative solution.  Eryaspase is 
an off -shelf investigational agent. Eryaspase is produced for 
each individual patient taking into account blood group and 
phenotype and dose appropriate for body weight.  
 
We hypothesize that the addition of Eryaspase  to 
FOLFIRINOX (5 -fluorouracil [5 -FU], leucovorin, irinotecan, 
and oxaliplatin) will be safe and demonstrate preliminary 
signs of efficacy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

3. INTRODUCTION  
 
3.1 Background  
 
Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy. In the [LOCATION_002], there will be 
an estimated 55,440 new cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed in 2018, with the 
disease causing an estimated 44,330 deaths. The estimated 5 year survival is poor at 
8.5 %1,[ADDRESS_215916] patients present with 
locally advanced or metastatic disease; and standards of care that consist of relat ively 
ineffective chemotherapeutic regimens.  Surgical resection is the only curative 
treatment for pancreatic cancer, however, only 15 -20% of patients present with 
operable disease5,6. 
 
Improving survival in metastatic or unresectable disease remains a challenge; for 
decades many chemotherapy trials were conducted, however, most failed to 
demonstrate efficacy. For the past decade, we had only two studies that showed 
meaningful small improvements in survival and changed the practice. The 
PRODIGE4/ ACCORD 1 1 trial compared  FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil with irinotecan 
hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin) to single -agent gemcitabine in 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX demonstrated a significant  
survival advantage; median overal l survival (mOS) of 11.1 months (m) vs. 6.8 m (HR 
Page 12 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  0.57, P <0.001,)2. While the MPACT trial evaluated gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel 
combination to gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, nab -
paclitaxel was associated with improved su rvival; mOS of 8.5 m vs. 6.7 m (HR 0.57, P 
<0.001)7. Unfortunately, since these studies, we have not made any new progress that 
has change d the outcome of this devastating disease. Hence, new therapeutics that 
provide greater clinical efficacy in patient s with pancreatic cancer are urgently needed.  
 
KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma virus) mutations are observed in more than 90% pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC)8,9. KRAS mutations provoke a constitutive activation 
of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT -mTOR pathway s, reprogramming of metabolic 
pathways that allow continued cellular proliferation in the absence of nutrients required 
by [CONTACT_182815]10,11. Consequently, targeting cell metabolism is a novel approach in 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma12. 
 
What distinguishe s the pancreatic tumor cell’s metabolism from normal cells is the 
dependence on metabolites that are utilized through the non -canonical metabolic 
pathway13. The amino acid glutamine, for instance, has an essential role in sustaining 
anabolic metabolism and biosynthetic pathways, including the de novo synthesis of 
asparagine14,15 . Asparagine is a non -essential amino acid, synthesized intracellularly 
from glutamine and aspartic acid by [CONTACT_182816] (ASNS). 
However, this biosynthesis capacity varies between cells16. 
 
3.2 Preclinical Data  
 
In leukemic cells, the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) is lacking, therefore, it depends on 
circulating asparagine in the serum17. The modulation of glutamine and asparagine metabolism 
was targeted with L-Asparaginase (L -ASNase ). L-ASNase  induces an antineoplastic effect 
through catalyzing the asparagine to ammonia and aspartic acid, consequently, depletion of 
serum asparagine leading to cycle arrest and cell death. Moreover, ASPNase deplete the serum 
glutamine as it acts as a substrate for the enzyme, and thus contributing further to cell growth 
inhibition and apoptosis18. Hence, L -ASNase  has been tested and used in pediatric acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and has become one of the cornerstone compo nents of 
chemotherapy regimens used in ALL.  
 
Interestingly, ASNS expressions are high in normal pancreatic cells. However, more than 50% 
of pancreatic adenocarcinoma has low  or no  expression of ASNS19,20. Therefore, the modulation 
of glutamine and asparagine metabolism has become an investigational therapeutic strategy of 
interest in pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, L-ASNase has a narrow therapeutic index and was 
correlated with significant toxicity when  it was tested in solid tumors, including pancreatic 
cancer21.  
 
Eryaspase is an encapsulated Escherichia Coli  L-ASNase within erythrocytes. It’s a novel way 
of delivering L-ASNase that led to the delivery of effective doses with less toxic effects. 
Enca psulation of L-ASNase decreases the rapid degradation of L-ASNase in the blood, thus 
prolonging activity, with a half -life of approximately two weeks. Furthermore, encapsulation 
limits exposure to the immune system and, subsequently, decreases its intrinsi c immunogenicity 
and hypersensitivity reactions22. 
 
3.3 Previous Human experience  
 
Page 13 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  Encapsulated L -asparaginase within erythrocytes investigated in GRASPALL 2005 
phase I/II,  a multicente r randomized controlled trial, investigated the safety profile of 
three  dose levels (50, 100, and 150 IU/kg). The study results suggested a reduction in 
the number and severity of allergic reactions and a trend towards fewer coagulation 
disorders. Other adverse events were comparable to those observed w ith E. coli L -
asparagin ase, and  there was also no difference between the three doses22. 
 
In pancreatic cancer, two clinical trials have been conducted. The first clinical trial in 
pancreatic cancer was GRASPA 2008 trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a national, multicenter, 
open -label, phase 1 dose -escalation study, which investigated Eryaspase as a single 
agent in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer progressed after two lines of 
therapy. Twelve patients were enrolled,  and they received a single administration of 
Eryaspase as monotherapy (25, 50, 100, or 150 IU/Kg). No dose -limiting toxicity was 
reported. The recommended Phase 2 dose was determined to be 100 IU/Kg every two 
week s23.   
 
Subsequently, a Phase 2, multice nter, open -label trial investigating Eryaspase in 
combination with gemcitabine or mFOLFOX6 (modified FOLinic acid -Fluorouracil -
Oxaliplatin -6 regimen) as second -line treatment in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer was conducted. The trial was comple ted in 2017. The endpoint of the study was 
an improvement in progression -free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) in patients 
with no or low ASNS (0/1) expression as determined by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC), 
with a target hazard ratio (HR) < 0.85. Seco ndary endpoints included OS, PFS, 
objective response rate, safety, and QoL. A total of 141 patients were enrolled and 
randomized, 95 to Eryaspase plus chemotherapy and 46 to chemotherapy alone. The 
majority of patients (90%) received gemcitabine during the  study. Both co -primary 
endpoints were met in the ASNS 0/1+ subgroup (Eryaspase, n= 66; control, n= 32), 
with HRs of 0.[ADDRESS_215917] of care 
chemotherapy.  
 
Eryaspase's safety and efficacy also have been under investigation in other clinical 
trials, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)24 and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)25.

treatment of patients with the unresectable disease w orldwide and thus justifies our combination 
of FOLFIRINOX plus Eryaspase.  
 
3.5 Justification for Dose  
 
We plan to use modified dosing of FOLFIRINOX which has been an accepted practice across 
recent clinical trials, the infusion 5 -FU, Oxaliplatin and are given at a full dose. The Irinotecan 
Page 14 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  is given at a modified dose in order to minimize Gastrointestinal an d hematologic toxicity, and 
the bolus 5 -FU is eliminated in order to minimize myelosuppression. Eryaspase has been 
previously evaluated in twelve patients at dose levels 25. 50. 100 and 150 units/kg without 
evidence of a dose limited toxicities. The recomm ended phase 2 dose was 100 units/kg.  We 
will start with a dose of 75 units/kg, with the goal of reaching 100 units /kg, however, will also 
build in a -1/-2 dose level of 50 /25 units /kg.  
 
4. Objectives  
 
4.1 Primary Objective  
 
 The primary objective of this study i s to determine the maxim um tolerated dose, 
tolerability and safety of  Eryaspase in combination with the dose -modified 
FOLFIRINOX in patients with n ewly diagnosed locally advanced  or metastatic 
pancreatic adenoc arcinoma.  
 
4.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
 To estimate the objective response rate (ORR)  
 To summarize progression -free survival (PFS)  
 To summarize overall survival (OS)  
 
5. Study Design  
 
5.[ADDRESS_215919] 3+[ADDRESS_215920] 1 escalation level 
and 2 de -escalation levels beyond the initial dose level.  
 
 
5.3 Cohorts/Escalation scheme  
 
The study will use a standard 3+[ADDRESS_215921] a 3 -day stagger in enrollment between individual subjects. With the 3+[ADDRESS_215922] 4 weeks and dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) have been reported. The  MTD 
is defined as the highest dose level where at most 1 of 6  patients experience a dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). Three patients  will be treated at dose level 0. If 0/3 experience a DLT, 3 new  
Page 15 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  patients will be enrolled at the  next higher dose level. If 1/3 experience a DLT, 3 additional 
patients will be enrolled at the  same dose level. If 1/[ADDRESS_215923] dose level, 3 new patients will be enrolled  at the next higher dose level; 
if 1/[ADDRESS_215924] who withdraws from the escalation phase of  
the study for reasons other than a DLT will be replaced.  
 
FOLFIRINOX treatment will be  given on Day 1 and 1 5 of the 4 weeks cycle and continued 
until unacceptable toxicity or disease  progression, for a maximum of 12 treatments (6 months) 
of FOLFIRINOX . Subjects will receive a single intravenous administration of Eryaspase on 
Day [ADDRESS_215925] 1.1 a t the end of the 12 -week period (Day 85) a re eligible for the 
continuation of FOLFIRINOX plus eryaspase treatment until dise ase progression or

o Eryaspase Administration  
o FOLFIRINOX Administration  
7.8 End of Treatment/Safety Follow -up 
Subjects will complete an end of treatment (EOT) evaluation 4 weeks  (+/- 7 days)  after the last 
day of treatment on study or after tumor progression is documented. In addit ion, a positive 
urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.   
 
Survival follow up will be conducted by [CONTACT_648], visit, or medica l records review every 8 we eks 
(±1 week ) from end of treatment visit until patient’s death, loss to follow up, or study closure. 
Subsequent anti -cancer treatment should be collected during this follow up.  
 
8 Study Assessment  
 
8.1 Efficacy  Assessments  
 
8.1.1 Tumor Assessment  
 
Methods of evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775] , including 
a ruler estimating the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_215964] and MRI:  These guidelines have  defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scans based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_215965] slicing 
thickness greater than  5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also  acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and tempo ral 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality,  lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore,  the availability of 
MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the  technical specifications of 
the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow up should be the same as was 
used at baseline and  the lesions should be m easured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is 
beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescr ibe specific MRI pulse sequence 
parameters for all scanners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be 
used and the image acqui sition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior  scans. 
Body scans should be performed with breath  hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
 
8.2 Safety Assessments  
 
8.2.1  Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, and ECGs  
 
A physical examination wil l be performed during screening , Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, 15, and 
22, and Day 1 and Day 15 on all subsequent cycles .  
 
Vital signs will be measured at all study visits. Blood  pressure, pulse rate, and body 
temperature will be  measured in accordance with the study site’s standard  operating 
procedures. Body weight and height will be measured at screening. Body height will be 
performed only at the  screening period, and body weight will be measured at all  visits.  
 
12-Lead ECGs will be acquired during the Screenin g period, and on Day 1 (pre -dose),  
Day 15 (pre -dose) of  Cycle 1. The ECG recordings will be reviewed  for any evidence of 
abnormalities. In particular, any  evidence of QT/QTcF prolongation will be recorded as 
an adverse event.  
 
8.2.2 Clinical Laboratory Ass essments  
 
The following tests  will be performed at the local laboratories at the visits id entified in 
the Time and Events tables.  
 
o Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell 
(WBC) count with differential, platelet count, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean 
cell hemoglobin concentration  (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume, reticulocytes  
 
o Serum Chemistry:  liver panel  (total and direct bilirubin, AST, ALT),  GGT, renal 
panel (BUN, creatinine), albumin, sodium, potassium, magnesium, bicarbonate, 
chloride, calcium, inorganic phosphorus , glucose, total protein, alkaline 
phosphatase, , amylase,  and lipase . 
Page 29 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential   
o Coagulation:  Coag ulation pr ofile, plasma antithrombin III, fibrinogen, D-dimer, the 
international normalized ratio (INR), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).  
 
o Pregnancy  test (for all women of childbearing potential): Serum or Urine β HCG 
test 
 
o Tumor Marker:  CA19 -9 
 
o Complete compatibility testing : To be performed prior to Eryaspase 
administration by [CONTACT_182819]. If not compatible, eryaspase 
should NOT be administered and the sponsor  notified immediately. Depending on 
the individual circumstances the patient may receive chemotherapy alone and 
resume eryaspase at the next dose or delay dose for Erytech to remanufacture and 
ship the new bag of eryaspase. If incompatibility persists the patient will NOT 
receive further eryaspase, but can continue chem otherapy alone.  
 
8.3 Regulatory and Reporting Requirement s 
 
8.3.1 Adverse Events (AE)  
 
Adverse events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
participating in a clinical trial who is administered an  investigational product,  at any 
dose; the adverse event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with  
this product. An adverse  event could, therefore, be any unfavorable and/or unintended 
sign ( including abnormal laboratory findings),  symptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use  of an investigational product, whether or not considered  related 
to the investigational product. This definition inc ludes intercurrent illnesses or injuries, 
and exacerbation of pre -existing conditions . 
 
All adverse events occu rring in subjects who have received the treatment will be 
recorded o n the CRF and will be reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.  
Adverse events report ed prior to the commencement of administration of stud y 
medication will be considered pretreatme nt events . All adverse events will be 
monit ored until resolution or, if the AE is determined to be chronic, until a cause is 
identified. To the extent possible, any adverse events that are deemed to study drug -
related and are ongoing at End of Treatment wi ll be followed up to resolution or until a 
determination is made that the unresolved event is stable.  If an adverse event remains 
unresolved at the conclusion of the study, a c linical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_182820] d the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor whether continued fo llow-up of the 
adverse event is warranted.  
 
Laboratory abnormalities  and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate thera peutic 
medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.  
 
An elective surgery/procedure  scheduled to occur during a study will not be 
considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -
existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  
However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., 
Page 30 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for 
which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse 
event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grading Adverse Events  
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be uti lized for all toxicity reporting. 
A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/pr otocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_
Reference_5x7.pdf  
 
For AEs not listed, the following scale will be used:  
 Mild (Grade 1): no limitation of usual activities  
 Moderate (Grade 2): some limitation of usual activities  
 Severe (Grade 3): inability to carry out usual  activities  
 Life-threatening (Grade 4): an immediate risk of death  
 Death (Grade 5)  
 
8.3.2  Unanticipated Problems  
 
An unanticipated problem is defined as:  
 Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity or  frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol  and informed  consent  document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 Related or possibly related  to partic ipation  in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and  
 Suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
Since it is anticipated t hat there will be deaths due to pancreatic cancer p rogression in 
this study, death  will not necessarily b e considered unexpected in this study.  
 
8.3.3  Relationship to Study Drug    
 
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the 
adverse event to the use of study drug:  
 
Related:  A causal relationship between the medicinal product (and/or study 
procedures) and AE is a reasonable possibility. For example, the occurrence of the AE 
cannot be explained by [CONTACT_14541]. The AE, however, can be explained by 
[CONTACT_182822] a similar event having been 
reported previously, alteration of the dose effect, or the timing or seriousness of the 
AE, etc. Positive re -challenge/de -challenge is supportive.  
 
Page 31 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  Not Related:  A causal relationship betwee n the medicinal product (and/or study 
procedures) and AE is not a reasonable possibility: there is no temporal relationship 
between the medicinal product and event, or an alternative etiology is more 
reasonable.  
 
For every adverse event, the investigator must attribute whether the adverse event was 
due to study medication, or other causes. If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_182800](s) is given, an “other” cause of event must be provid ed by [CONTACT_182823].   
 
8.3.4  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A Serious Adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at 
any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (i.e., the patient was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_182801] I nvestigator or 
Sponsor, at immediate risk of  death from the event as it occurred)  
 Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (unless planned for observation, protocol 
compliance, elective procedures, social reasons).  This does not include an emergency 
room visit  or admission to an outpatient facility.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important and significant medical event that,  based on appropriate medical 
judgment, may  jeopardize the pat ient and/or may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other  outcomes defining serious.  
 
Disease progression  is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE or 
SAE (even if fatal). Disease progression should be documented. If AEs/SAEs occur in 
relation to disease progression that are not consistent with the natural progression of 
the patient’s dis ease, these AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting 
requirements.  
 
For patients enrolled outside of Georgetown University, serious adverse events will 
also be reported, and all supporting documentation emailed to Georgetown University’s 
Multicenter Project Management Office and to the study PI, [CONTACT_182840], within [ADDRESS_215966] dose  in the study 
until he/she completes the  End of Treatment visit . SAEs brought to the attention of the 
investigator at any time after cessation of the study drugs and cons idered by [CONTACT_182824] -Investigator 
and Multicenter Project Management Office, if and when they occur.  
 
8.3.5  Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
A serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction is  defined as an unexpected serious 
adverse event w here there is a reasonable possi bility that the drug caused the serious 
Page 32 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  adverse event. For t he purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possi bility” 
means t here is evidence to suggest a causal relati onship between the drug and the 
adverse event. Suspected ad verse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction,  which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
8.3.6  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_182802] 3+[ADDRESS_215967] of the study will comply with all FDA safety  reporting requirements. It's the 
responsibility of the  Site-Investigator  to report any Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  to 
the FDA  as follows:  
 
Report any unexpected fatal or life -threatening  adverse experiences associated with the use of 
the drug (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility that the  experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_182825])  by [CONTACT_68002] [ADDRESS_215968]  (in the view of the investigator) at imm ediate risk of  death from the reaction as it 
occurred, i.e., it does not  include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more  severe form, might 
have caused death.  
 
Report any serious, unexpected adverse  experiences, as well as results from animal  studies th at 
suggest significant clinical risk, within 15  calendar days after initial receipt of this information.  
 
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study/study drug, will be summarized and reported to 
the FDA at annual reports by [CONTACT_1034] -Investigator . 
 
A serious adverse drug experience is defined as any  adverse drug  experience occurring at any 
dose that  results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182803].  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (i.e., substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability  to conduct normal life functions)  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Any other experience which, based upon  appropriate medical judgment, may j eopardize  
the subject and may  require medical or  surgical intervention to prevent one of the  
outcomes listed above . 
 
An unexpected adv erse drug experience is defined as any adverse d rug experience, the 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent wit h the expectedness assessment with the 
Section 7 reference safety information of the current investigator brochure (or risk information, 
if an IB  is not required or available).  
 
All MedWatch forms will  be sent by [CONTACT_68003]’s team to  the FDA at the 
following address or by [CONTACT_6791]:

8.3.8  Reporting of Pregnancy  
 
In cases of pregnancy or suspected pregnancy, the patient is to be discontinued immediately 
(within 24 hours) from the study and the female patient should be referred to an obstetrician - 
gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling. Pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, a positive pregnancy test and pregnancy outcomes 
must be reported to the study PI , and the Multicenter Project Management Office . If the 
pregnancy results in spont aneous abortion or stillbirth, the event should be reported as an SAE. 
If there are any abnormal outcomes that meet the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE. 
Please follow t he SAE reporting instructions . Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the 
female partners of any males who took study drug in this study. Pregnancy of the patient’s 
partner is not considered to be an AE.  Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy 
outcomes should be obtained from the female partner.  
 
8.3.9  Over dose  
 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion or infusing of any dose of study 
treatment that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs; 
however, all overdoses should be reported to the study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_182804] .  An overdose should be reported even if it does not result in an AE. Overdoses do not 
need to be recorded on the eCRF; dosing information is recorded on the dose administration 
eCRF. If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded as an AE.  An o verdose 
does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, 
for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as 
an SAE.

flushing, abdominal cramps,  diarrhea, etc.  
 
9.3.3   Growth Factor Support  
 
Indications for use of GCSF should follow American  Society for Cooperative Oncology 
(ASCO)  guidelines . The choice of  G-CSF support (filgrastim vs.  pegfilgrastim) is at the 
discretion of the treating  physician.  Use of the erythropoiesis -stimulating agent is not  
allowed . It is strongly recommended that patients over the age of 65 receive growth 
factor support  following in itiation of treatment .  
 
9.3.4   Transfusion of blood products  
 
Transfusion s are  permitted . However, transfusion of fresh  frozen plasma should be 
minimized, as it provides an  exogenous source of asparagine. It is preferable to  
administer antithrombin  III (AT III) concentrates in  case of a decrease in AT III following 
Eryaspase  administration. Hemoglobin must be ≥9 g/dL at Cycle  [ADDRESS_215977] be 
≥8 g/dL before all subsequent  doses. If hemoglobin is <8 g/dL, then appropriate  
measures must be taken ac cording to standard  clinical practice prior to further 
administration of  chemotherapy.

to provide adequate prophylactic or supportive care.  
 
9.4 Eryaspase  Acquisition, Accountability,  Preparation, Storage, and 
Handling  
9.4.1   Acquisition  
Eryaspase will be dispatched  directly  to each site only after receipt of  the required information 
in accordance with ERYTECH  procedures.   
 
Information to be provided at study start : Erythrocytes phenotype (including D, C, E, c, e, 
and K antigens), ABO blood group status, and Rhesus factor, all assessed on [ADDRESS_215981] (IA ST) are required. This information is required at least [ADDRESS_215982] Eryaspase infusion.   For group A and AB patients, sub -groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] A1/A1B and A2/A2B 
is required.  If A subgroup, screening of anti -A1 antibodies (Indirect Coombs method) s hould 
be performed for A2 and A2B patients. The A2 and A2B patients will require anti -A1 
antibodies screening before each administration along with IAST and documented on IAST 
form.  
 
Information to be provided during the treatment phase:  Results of IAST pe rformed less 
than [ADDRESS_215983] 5  working days prior to each Eryaspase infusion.  
 
The following information is required before  Eryaspase can be shipped to the site:  
o The name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_182827][INVESTIGATOR_841], who should be the Investigator or 
designee.  
o The location for delivery (local pharmacy or blood bank).  
 
Detailed instructions for completing and providing the phenotype, bl ood group, and Rhesus 
factor information, the IAST results, and the prescription form are provided in the IMP manual.  
Eryaspase will be shipped to the Investigator in a qualified container by a specialized carrier 
who will ensure that the cold chain is mai ntained between +2 -8°C (35 -46°F).  
 
Page 38 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  If a temperature excursion outside the range of +2°C to +8°C (35 -46°F) occurs, the product 
should be quarantined  and ERYTECH Pharma should be contact[CONTACT_182828].  Refer to  the IMP manual fo r ERYTECH contact [CONTACT_3031] . 
 
If it is not used immediately after receipt, it is mandatory that Eryaspase be stored at 
temperatures between +2 and +8°C (35 -46°F).  
 
Eryaspase may be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours prior to administration, 
including infusion time; it must not be stored at room temperature for more than [ADDRESS_215984] maintenance (i.e.,  records of receipt, reconciliation, and  final disposition).  
Further guidance and information concerning the final  disposition of unused IMP are 
provided in the IMP Manual.  
 
9.4.3   Formulation, Appearance, Packaging, and Labelling  
Eryaspase is packed in medical -grade polyvinyl chloride  (PVC) bags. The  final volume 
of the Eryaspase bag  depends on the patient’s weight and the dose prescribed.  The 
volume of the bag ranges from 50 mL to 300 mL  depending on the individual patient’s 
dose (multiple bags  may be required to achieve the full dose).  
 
Three (3) re movable segment -tubes are attached to the  bag for use in blood 
compatibility testing before  administration.  
 
Label statements are specific to the clinical trial and comply  with legal requirements for 
IMPs. The date and time of  Eryaspase  expi[INVESTIGATOR_182806]. In  addition, 
the label displays specific information necessary  for traceability of source cell material 
and medicinal product  (blood bank identifier for original erythrocytes, phenotype,  
patient identification Prepar ation number, etc.) to allow  verification of the patient’s 
identity and blood group before  administration.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_215985] (cross  match test) between the 
patient's  blood and Eryaspase,  using the removabl e segment tubes, should be 
performed  to confirm compatibility. In case a patient receives multiple  bags of 
Eryaspase to achieve the intended prescribed dose,  a separate test must be performed 
with each Eryaspase  bag to confirm compatibility.  
 
Eryaspase  should not be transferred to another  container before infusion. 
Eryaspase should not be  mixed or administered simultaneously with any other  
products, solutions, or medicinal products.

safety monitoring of this trial. As this study is an investigator -initiated  phase I study utilizing FDA -
approved on label, and off label therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is consid ered a high-risk study which requires real -time 
monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_182807] (DSMC).  The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_182840] , will review the data including safety monitoring 
at study teleconferences with participating sites. All SAEs are required to be reported to the local and to the 
Georgetown IRB , per each IRB policy . Based on SAEs, the IRB retains the authority to suspend further 
accrual pending more detailed reporting and/or mo difications to further reduce risk and maximize the 
safety of participating patients.  
 
Progress on the trial and the toxicities experienced will be reviewed by [CONTACT_182829] [ADDRESS_215987] in 
reaching a mutually acceptable decision.  
 
If a recommendation is made to change a trial for reasons oth er than patient safety or efficacy the DSMC 
will provide an adequate rationale for its decision. If the DSMC recommends that the trial be closed for any 
reason, the recommendation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_182830].  
Authority to close a trial for safety reasons lies with the IRB, with the above described input from DSMC 
and the Associate Director for Clinical Research.  Of note, the DSMC will also review the safety data of 
the patients enrolled outside of Georgetown Un iversity. Georgetown University’s Multi center Project

office to ensure patient’s privacy is protected.  
 
12.5 Investigator Responsibilities  
 
Prior to trial initiation, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor with  a fully executed and signed 
FDA Form 1572 and a Financial  Disclosure Form. Financial Disclosure Forms also will be  
completed for all Sub-Investigat ors listed on the Form 1572 who will be involved directly in the 
treatment or evaluation of research subjects in this trial.  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of  Helsinki (amended by [CONTACT_941] 
59th World Medical Associ ation General  Assembly, October 2008) and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP)  according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)  guidelines. Specifically, the 
study is based on adequately  performed laboratory and animal experimentation; the study will b e 
conducted under a protocol reviewed by a properly constituted  IEC; the study will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_182836]; the benefits of the study are in proportion to the  risks; 
the rights and welfare of the subjects will be res pected; and  each subject will give his/her informed 
consent before any  protocol -specific tests or evaluations are performed.

Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  13 Data Management and Confidentiality  
 
13.1 Data Sharing Plan  
 
Data sharing for this study will be conducted in compliance with the February 26, 2003 NIH Statement on 
Data Sharing (NOTICE: NOT -OD-03-032). The collaborating sites for this study generate a wide variety 
of scientific and clinical data and Data Sharing and Archiving will be handled by [CONTACT_182837], institutional internal document retention policies and all application rules, 
regulations and statutes. Subject to institutional policies, local IRB guidelines, and local, state and Federal 
laws and regulations including the Privacy Ru le and the Bayh -Dole Act, we will make finished research 
data available through scientific presentations, publications (paper, web and other), depositing gene 
sequence, gene expression and other data in searchable electronic repositories, attendance at sci entific 
meetings and extending invitations to scientists from other institutions for discussion. In accordance with 
the NIH policy, such data shall be made widely and freely available while safeguarding the privacy of 
participants and protecting Lombardi’s  confidential and proprietary data.  
 
The participating sites will maintain awareness, and may participate in, discussions between members of 
multiple scientific and technical disciplines and their professional societies concerning data sharing, 
standards and best practices, and to create an environment that supports and develops data sharing tools. 
We will participate in or make ourselves aware of the outcome of any workshops the NIH or AACR will 
convene to address data sharing and which may address areas such as cleaning and formatting data, writing 
documentation, redacting data to protect subjects' identities and proprietary information, and estimating 
costs to prepare documentation and data for sharing.  
 
The NIH has recognized the need to protect patent able and other proprietary data and notes the restrictions 
on the sharing of data that may be imposed by [CONTACT_182838]. Under the Bayh -Dole Act, 
grantees have the right to elect and retain title to subject inventions developed with Federal funding, and 
further, to commercialize any invention to which they retain title. Since it is not the stated intent of the NIH 
statement on Data Sharing to discourage, impede or prohibit the development of commercial products from 
federally funded research,  our collaborating sites will continue to perform inventive activities, to seek 
patent protection for inventions that relate to data generated and may choose to defer publication or enter 
into agreements with third parties that may result in certain restri ctions on data sharing. We note that 
seeking patent protection results in publication of the patent application into the public domain and, thus, 
may result in the data being broadly disseminated.  
 
All specimens submitted to any of the shared resource lab oratories will be bar -coded upon receipt and 
assigned a unique identifier using a common software program. Tracking of specimens and their utilization 
will be carried out using a web -based system that will represent a modification of the systems presently in 
place at Georgetown (including but not limited to G -DOC, Georgetown Database of Cancer, Medidata 
Rave, REDCap), which will also give us the ability to track sample utilization. These systems have an 
“honest broker” interface which ensures HIP AA complian ce and protection of any human subjects. As the 
same sample may well be used for genomic, proteomic, histopathological and clinical interrogation, 
assignment of a unique identifier as well as a common administrative structure ensures efficient cross -
databa se interrogation.  
 
13.2 Data security  
 
The rights and privacy of people who participate in sponsored clinical research will be protected at all 
times. In the event that data is intended for broader use, it will be de -identified and would not permit 
linkag es to individual research participants and variables that could lead to deductive disclosure of the 
Page 43 of 46 
Version 2.1, 16 March 2022       Confidential  identity of individual subjects. No efforts will be made to identify individual cases, and any shared archive 
data will not be linked to other identifiable data. The following de -identification and security procedures 
will be followed to share information with collaborators part of the study:  
1) Deletion of 18 HIPAA identifiers  
a. Non-identifiable unique patient ID will be generated in G -DOC  
2) Secure netID -based sing le sign -on (netID is Georgetown’s LDAP based secure login system)  
3) Users will have to authenticate  themselves prior to accessing controlled data  
4) Furthermore, based on their roles, users will require authorization  to see specific studies  
5) Auditing and securit y assessments will be performed on a quarterly basis to ensure appropriate de -
identification procedures and use of data.  
 
For future studies involving new data types that are not covered in the descriptions above, NIH policy on 
data sharing will be followe d where applicable. For example, Genome Wide Association Studies, if 
conducted, will comply with NIH Guidelines NOT -OD-07-088 ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/gwas/ ) for data 
release. Following these guidelines, GWAS data will be submitted to NCBI’s dbGAP 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap ) or other tools as the NIH’s policy on GWAS evolves . 
 
13.3 Data Disclosure  
 
GUMC (Georgetown University Medical Center) has a Confidentiality and Non -Disclosure policy that 
pertains only to proprietary information belonging to GUMC. The disclosure of research information such 
as microarray analysis results is at the discretion of the faculty and staff. Notably, investigators with NIH 
funding are expected to make their data and results public in a reasonable time frame (Please see the 
University plan for sharing and distributing biomedical research resources at 
http://otc.georgetown.edu/documents/inventors/NIHGrantLetter_ModelOrganismsUpdate_6 -27-05.doc  . 
To protect institutional intellectual property, the institution does ha ve an internal review process prior to 
submission of journal manuscripts. This process will be propagated to other study sites as well.

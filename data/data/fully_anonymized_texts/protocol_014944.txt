Study Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878723]:  MTI-117 
Sponsor:  Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  
Development Phase:  Phase 2 
Study Objectives:  Primary  objective: To assess the efficacy of repeated oral doses of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878724] . 
Secondary  objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses 
of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878725].  
Study Design:  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to assess the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878726]. Subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1227589] of three perio ds, for a total study period of 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 3 weeks  
• Treatment period: 10 weeks  
• Follow -up period: [ADDRESS_1227590]’s history, physical examination, and/or screening labs (e.g. scabies skin preparations, urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori ), the 
subject may not be randomized until these are completed and the pruritus i s still 
considered to be of unknown origin.  
Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the S creening  visit. Subjects must be 
willing and able to complete the eDiary every day  within a consistent 
timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , for 
the duration of the study.  
At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) at the site on the first day of the treatment period 
(Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day until the 
completion of the 10-week treatment period. Study drug may be taken with or 
without food. 
After the last dose of study drug, all subjects will enter a 5-week follow -up 
period and will undergo a follow -up visit at the conclusion of the follow -up 
period . 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment.

• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) 
• Changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters following study 
drug exposure  
• Changes from baseline in vital sign and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters following study drug exposure  
• Plasma concentrations of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878731] s: The exploratory endpoints are as follows:  
• Change from baseline in the Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  to Weeks 2, 4, 
6, and 10  
• Change from baseline in Static Patient Global Assessment of Itch Severity (sPGA) to Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10 
• Patient Global Impression of Change in Itch Severity (PGIC) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 10  
Decision Rule and 
Sample Size: This study will use a 5% one-sided alpha level.  
The target sample size of 200 randomized and dosed subjects ( 100 per group) 
has been determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% alp ha level. Two hundred subjects results in at least 90% power 
assum ing a placebo 4 -point responder rate of % and a serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  4-point 
responder  rate of more than %. 
Statistical Methods:  Efficacy analyses will be based upon an intent -to-treat philosophy. The primary 
efficacy population will be the full analysis  population that will include all 
randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the treatment  group to which they are randomized.
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is a binary variable taking on values of responder 
or non -responder. Subjects will be considered a responder if they have at least a 
4-point reduction in WI -NRS from baseline to Week 10. Missing data 
imputation will be used for subjects who fail to complete the eDiary at Week 10, 
unless the subject withdrew from the study due to a lack of efficacy, or the 
subject used rescue therapy (i.e. an excluded therapy to treat worse ning of 
pruritus ), in which case their responder status will be defined as non- responder. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_250239].  
The difference in the primary efficacy outcome measure between  treatment 
groups will be tested using a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test controlling for the 
stratification factors. Testing of selected secondary efficacy endpoints will also 
be employed.

The incidence of all adverse events (AEs) and treatment -related AEs will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_82153]. These AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_247060]. For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded 
to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted 
only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related AEs, AEs by 
[CONTACT_926], SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be presented. 
 
Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be 
tabulated for laboratory results by [CONTACT_96013].  
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at 
any post- baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from baseline 
laboratory values will be tabulated.  
The overall ECG assessment (abnormal or normal) will be summarized along with a summary of how many  subjects developed a post treatment abnormal 
result.

Version 3.0   Page 15 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Chronic Pruritus of Unknown O rigin  
Pruritus, or itch, is defined as an unpleasant sensation that elicits the desire or reflex to 
scratch ( Ikoma 2006). Scratching can result in removal of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_878732], which is thought to be a n evolutionary mechanism to dislodge potential parasites. 
Itch is also caused by [CONTACT_878760] a type of 
pruritus that can become chronic and debilitating ( Hoon 2015). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_878733] 13% to 17%, with l ifetime 
prevalence of 22% to 26% ( Carr 2014). Pruritus can have a substantial negative effect on 
quality of life, including effects on “mood, concentration, eating habits, sexual function, and sleep,” ( Carr 2014) and chronic pruritus has been shown to have an impact on quality of life 
similar to that of  chronic pain ( Kini 2011 ).
  
Chronic pruritus may be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including both derm atological and systemic diseases. Many of these conditions present with visible skin 
involvement, such as in atopic dermatitis. Others may be associated with pruritus in the absence of visible skin involvement, such as in Hodgkin’s disease. However, in 8–15% of patients with chronic pruritus, an underlying etiology cannot be identified ( Weisshaar 2012 ). 
Terms  in the scientific literature that have been used to describe this population include 
generalized pruritus of unknown origin , chronic idiopathic pruritus, and chronic itch of 
undetermined origin ( Millington 2018, Xu 2016, Weisshaar 20 09). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_878734] ( Ständer 2010), 
and the term chronic pruritus in  the elderly has been used synonymously to describe elderly 
patients who present with no overt identified cause of pruritus, representing both a significant proportion of pruritus burden in the elderly, as well as a source of frustration for the affected patient and the treating physician alike ( Ständer 2007, Berger 2013).  
Emerging evidence indicates that the aging process itself may be involved as a primary etiologic factor in chronic pruritus in the absence of other overt causes. Xerosis and other changes in skin barrier function, increasing sensorineural dysfunction, and senescent changes in the immune system have been implicated as contributory factors ( Berger 2011, 
Shevchenko 2018, Xu 2016). It is likely that chronic pruritus of unknown origin and chronic pruritus in the elderly represent significantly overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_399370], especially as the age range of 51–60 years is one of the peak age ranges associated with a lifetime prevalence of chronic pruritus ( Matterne 2011).  
As the management of chronic pruritus is dependent on treatment of any underlying disease, chronic pruritus in the absence of an identified underlying disease or chronic pruritus in 
which the aging process itself may be the primary causal factor  can make treatment of 
pruritus in these patients  extremely challenging.  No drugs are currently approved in the US 
for the primary treatment of pruritus, and off- label use of available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3066] H1 
antihistamines, gabapentin, and immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids and biologics can require significant trade -offs in terms of efficacy,  tolerability, safety, and cost 
(Weisshaar  2012).  Issues with to lerability and safety are often magnified in management of 
chronic pruritus with advancing age ( Pereira 2018 ).

Version 3.0   Page 16 1.2 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor  
Substance P is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin family of neuropeptides, a 
group that also includes neurokinin A and neurokinin B ( Hökfelt 2001). SP has been 
implicated in a number of biological functions, both physiologi cal and pathophysiological, 
including pruritus perception, vomiting reflex, pain perception, and immunomodulatory 
responses ( Lotts 2014, Andoh 1998, Steinhoff 2014). Th e biological actions of SP are 
mediated by [CONTACT_727344], which consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains coupled to G-proteins. Three tachykinin receptors have been identified: the neurokinin-1, neurokinin-2, and neurokinin-3 receptors ( Harrison 2001). The neurokinin-1 
receptor ( NK
1 receptor ) in particular has been studied in great detail. The NK [ADDRESS_1227599] for pruritus perception 
(Ständer 2015). Inhibition of this pathway resul ts in decreased pruritus and scratching 
reflexes in animal models ( Akiyama 2015). Preceding the development of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357478]-related conditions, a commercially available NK [ADDRESS_1227600] ( Emend  USPI ) 
has been used as a therapy to decrease pruritus in patients  with chronic pruritus  due to 
etiologies such as cutaneous T -cell lymphoma  (Duval 2009, Torres 2012, Booken 2011) and 
erlotinib -induced pruritus  (Santini 2012, Gerber 2010). Additionally, in a study of 20 patients  
with chronic pruritus of various etiologies treated with aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] , 16/20 patients  (80%) 
experienced a considerable reduction of itch intensity  (Ständer 2010).

and metabolized by [CONTACT_9058]  P-450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ), with a plasma half -life of 
45−86 hours. It binds with high affinity to the human NK 1-R with a dissociation constant 
(Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half-maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50) of

Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357479], including chronic 
toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; slight skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357480] (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have

 Plasma concentrations of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247008] r to increase in a dose-proportional 
fashion in both young adult males and elderly  subjects ( males and females ). Peak plasma 
concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 4 hours  in both young adult and 
elder ly subjects. A single loading dose of up to 15 mg serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878735] 6 to 8 weeks of 
up to 5 mg daily serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878736] . 
Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate good plasma exposures with oral  dosing, linear 
dose- dependent increases in plasma concentration and systemic exposure, a plasma t 1/2 
supportive of once daily dosing, and mild effects of concomitant food ingestion. Central nervous system (CNS) positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated good CNS penetrance and > 90% NK1 receptor occupancy (RO) at plasma exposures anticipated to be safe and well tolerated. Three long -lived active hydroxylated metabolites are observed 
in humans: M1/M1a (L-001256771), M2/M2a (L-001194442), and M3 (L-001426583). These metabolites were present at lower concentrations and were 2 - to 9-fold less potent in 
vivo than the parent compound. The integrated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
analysis concluded that these metabolites are unlikely to  contribute significantly to 
occupancy of the CNS NK
1-R in humans. 
1.3.3 Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357469] -Related Studies  
Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878737] 2 studies of subjects with chronic 
pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP-102). Three additional Phase 2 studies in pruritus indications 
(history of atopic dermatitis , epi[INVESTIGATOR_108631], and psoriasis ) are clinically complete 
with study reports pending.

Version 3.0   Page 18 TCP-101 
TCP-101 was a double-blind, placebo- controlled, multi-center study that compared  
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0. 25 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg vs . placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus. A total 
of 257 adult subjects 18–65 years of age with chronic pruritus  were randomized to receive 
one of the four dose groups in a 1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1227606] profound for the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  1 mg and 5 mg groups. For the percent change from 
Baseline in VAS pruritus  scores (the primary efficacy variable), the Week [ADDRESS_1227607] 
squares mean difference compared to placebo was 5.8  mm, 13.2 mm, and 14.2 mm for 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25  mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg, respectively .  
The frequency of treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAE s) and study drug related adverse 
events ( AEs) was higher in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg and 5 mg groups compared to the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
0.25 mg group, and the frequency in all three treatment groups were higher than in the placebo group. The frequency of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation was comparable in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg and placebo group and higher than in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg and 1 mg groups. There was one serious adverse event ( SAE) reported in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg 
group (spontaneous abortion, considered not related). There were no deaths. The most common AEs in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357484] (6.2%, 1 mg group), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (4.7%, 0.25 mg group), somnolence (4.7%, 5 mg group), nasopharyngitis (4.6%, 1 mg group), headache (4.7%, 5 mg group), urinary tract infection (3.1%, 5 mg group), dry mouth (3.1%, 1 mg group), nausea (3.1%, 1 mg group), arthralgia (3.1%, 
0.25 mg group), musculoskeletal pain (3.1%, 1 mg group) and pruritus (3.1%, 1 mg  group). 
The most common AEs in the placebo group were headache (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.2%), 
upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (3.2%), urinary tract infection (3.2%) and asthma (3.2%).   
TCP-102 
TCP-102 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled multi- center study that 
evaluated serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg vs. placebo for the treatment of prurigo nodularis ( PN). A total of 
128 adult subjects 18-80 years of age with PN were randomized to receive serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727308] a 1:1 randomization. Subjects received a loading dose of 3 tablets on Day 1 
followed by 1 tablet per day for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the average VAS score as recorded at the study visits. Results at Week 4 and Week 8 were the primary timepoints.  
Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg was superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus as measured by [CONTACT_357534]. For the primary endpoint, change from baseline at Week 4 and Week 8 by [CONTACT_357535], the decrease from baseline was significantly greater in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878738], with a mean difference (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357487]) of -1.[ADDRESS_1227608] -hoc analysis, 25.0% of placebo subjects and 54.4% of 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878739] 4 -point responders  on average VAS at Week 8 . 
TEAEs were reported for 71.9% of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]- treated subjects and 61.9% of placebo -treated 
subjects. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357489] 
(17.2% serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 6.3% placebo). Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 48.4% of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]-treated subjects and 34.9% of placebo- treated subjects. The most frequently 
reported t reatment -related TEAEs in the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357490] (7.8%) and diarrhea, 
peripheral edema, dizziness, and headache (each 6.3%). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate; severe TEAEs were reported for 9.4% of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] -treated subjects and 4.8% of 
placebo- treated subjects. There were no deaths during the study. Five subjects (3 serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 
2 placebo) had SAEs. The SAE s were actinic elastosis, depression, dizziness, and vertigo in 
the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_247011]; and bradycardia, syncope, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and neurodermatitis in the placebo group. Nine subjects (3 serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053], 6 placebo) discontinued due to TEAEs. 
No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or

together with the extensive safety experience with serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878740] t he scientific 
rationale for NK 1-R inhibition in the treatment of pruritus, serve to support further evaluation 
of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878741].

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of repeated oral doses of 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878742]. 
The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral 
doses of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878725].  
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_878741]. Approximately 200 subjects who meet the study entry crite ria will be randomized in a 
1:[ADDRESS_1227610] of three periods, for a total study period of 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 3 weeks   
• Treatment period: 10 weeks 
• Follow-up period: [ADDRESS_1227611]’s 
history, physical examination, and/or screening labs (e.g. scabies skin preparations, urea 
breath test for Helicobacter pylori ), the subject may not be randomized until these are 
completed and the pruritus is still considered to be of unknown or igin.  
Subjects will be provided an eDiary at the Screening visit. Subjects must be willing and able 
to complete the eDiary every day within a consistent 6-hour timeframe, and comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], for the duration of the study. eDiary  
compliance and WI- NRS scores will be used to determine study eligibility (see Section 4.1).  
At the Baseline visit (Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive study drug (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_252366] t 5 mg or placebo). Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) 
at the site on the first day of the treatment period (Day 1). Starting on Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day  until the completion of the 10- week treatment period . Study drug may 
be taken with or without food. 
After the last dose of study drug, all subjects will enter a 5-week follow-up period and will 
undergo a follow-up visit at the conclusion of the follow-up period. The eDiary will continue to be completed during the follow-up period. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Week 10 of treatment.  3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection 
In the TCP -102 study in patients with PN , serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg taken daily for 8 weeks was 
superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population as well 
as the subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis. Similarly, in the TCP -101 study in 
patients  with chronic pruritus , serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  5 mg and 1 mg tak en daily for 6 weeks were 
superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus , in both the overall study population and the 
subgroup of subjects with an atopic diathesis.  In both the TCP-102 and TCP -101 studies, serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357499] -tolerated and 
demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated.

Protocol MTI -[ADDRESS_1227639] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug  in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include treatment emergent exacerbation s of pre- existing illness es and AE s that occur as 
a result of protocol- mandated  interventions.  
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect 
• Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but which may be considered serious by [CONTACT_76617], as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medical events include allergic bronch ospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357512] < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, 
admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g. routine colonoscopy). 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 41 The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the inten sity of an 
AE (e.g. mild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g. se vere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulato ry reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on the eCRF.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1227640] dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs.  
Only abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g. require active management or are associated with accompanying symptoms/signs) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eCRF . 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease or condition (e.g. elevated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney disease), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease) needs to be recorded on 
the AE eCRF  (rather than listing individual test findings as AEs).  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1227641] be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See Safety  Form Completion Instructions  for complete instructions. 
The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies and Contraception Requir ements for Females  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any fem ale 
who has experienced menarche and is pre -menopausal, unless permanently surgically sterile 
(e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy) . A postmenopausal 
state is defined as no menses for [ADDRESS_1227642] of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing 
Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2) dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines ( “U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use” 2010 ; 
“Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; “M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010) :  
All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception, which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods:  
1. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion  or ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy) 
2. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence  from heterosexual intercourse, 
only if planned for the entire duration of the study period and consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle for the subject  
3. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; t hese may 
include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods  
4. Intrauterine  device/system   
5. Exclusive (sole) monogamous intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castrated) male partner; the male partner must have 
received medical assessment of the surgical success  
 
Progesterone-only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method of 
contraception, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. Male or female condoms with or without spermicide, and female caps, diaphragms, and sponges with spermicide, or combinations (double barrier) are also excluded as highly effective contraceptive methods. 
Any pregnancy occurring in a female subjec t or the female partner of a male subject, from 
the first study drug administration through the required follow -up visit must be reported 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. See Safety Form  
Completion Instructions  for complete  instructions .  
The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies ( for example, spontaneous abortion) 
may qualify as SAEs and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be recorded and reported as SAEs. See 
Safety  Form Completion Instructions  for complete instructions.

follow-up visit . After the required follow -up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug-
related should be reported. 
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by [CONTACT_357543] a p rotocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs 
related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the source documents and SAE form, not on the AE eCRF. Subjects who undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1227645]’s medical record and on the AE eCRF page, and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator wil l make 
an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality.  
7.2.3 Assessment of Severity  
All AEs  entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0 (“ Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2017 ) to describe the maximum 
intensity of the adverse event.  
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the investigator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in  Table  1. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential   
Protocol MTI -117  
Version 3.0   Page 44 Table  1 Adverse Event Grading  
Grade  Severity  Alternate Descriptiona 
1 Mild (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical 
or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumenta l activities of daily living  
(ADLb) 
3 Severe (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria) Severe or medically significant but not 
immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; 
limiting self care ADLc 
4 Very severe, life threatening, or 
disabling (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.  
5 Death related to AE   
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or report ed AE is not 
in the NCI CTCAE listing.  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the altern ate description of the grade.  
b Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
c Self care ADL refer to  bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
Source: National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v 5.0 
 
Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory 
definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. 
If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), only the highest  severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF.   
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs  (serious and 
non-serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contr ibuted to an AE. 
Causality of an AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_247067]: 
• Likely  Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response patt ern to the 
suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. 
• Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due to factors other than the study drug.

Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_29013]/timepoint. For continuous variables, the following information will be presented: 
n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For 
categorical variables counts and percentages will be used.  Summary statistics for imputed 
efficacy data will be reported based upon imputed data. 
Baseline for measures other than the eDiary daily measures will be the last recorded value 
prior to the start of treatment. For daily measures including the WI- NRS, baseli ne will be the 
average result measured over the week prior to treatment.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample S ize  
This study will use a 5% one-sided alpha level.  The target sample size of 200 randomized and dosed subjects (100 per group) has been 
determined based upon a 1:1 allocation of subjects to treatment groups and a 5% one-alpha level. A sample size of two hundred subjects results in  at least 90% power assuming a 
placebo Week 10 4-point responder rate of % and serl opi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 4-point responder rate of 
%. 
The sample size calculations have been performed in PASS 13  (“PASS 13 Power Analysis 
and Sample Size Software” 2014 ) and use a Chi -Squared test . The primary analysis will 
control for the stratification factors. It is expected that this unstratified power estimate will under- estimate the true power as it does not take the variance reduction resulting from 
stratification into account ( Matts 1988).  
8.2 Handling of Missing Data  
Should a determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre- treatment , follow-up) be 
required for adverse events or concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a partial date, the event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible.  
If a subje ct fails to complete their eDiary for a week or more, the WI-NRS endpoints, 
including the primary endpoint, may be missing. In this case, the WI -NRS change from 
baseline value will be imputed. The approach uses the subject’s last week with data. From that point forward their trajectory will be imputed based upon the trajectory of their treatment group. 
The imputation  approach first determines the average change for each week  for each 
treatment group . The difference in the weekly measures between weeks n -[ADDRESS_1227648] 
their Week 6 WI -NRS change from baseline imputed as ∆ 4+∆P(4-6), where ∆ [ADDRESS_1227649] up to Week 4 and ∆ P(4-6) is the average placebo  
change from Week 4 to 6 (i.e. the average placebo decrease from Week 4 to 6). 
For the responder endpoints, the same imputation will be performed and the responder status 
determined based upon the change from baseline and the subject’s disposition and rescue medication status  (See Section 8.8 ).  
As a sensitivity analysis, a similar approach will be used where the imputation step uses multiple imputation methodology. 
8.3 Analysis Population s  
The primary efficacy population will be the full analysis population (FAP) and will include 
all randomized subjects who were dispensed study drug. Subjects will be analyzed within the 
treatment group  to which they are randomized.  
The primary safety population will be all treated subjects . For safety analyses, subjects will 
be classified based upon the treatment received.   
8.[ADDRESS_1227650] Disposition  
An accounting of all randomized subjects by [CONTACT_247070]. Subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and listed, with a description of the reason for early termination/withdrawal.

Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. 
8.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded by [CONTACT_357545] (ATC) and preferred drug name .  
Prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including over- the-counter medications) used to treat pruritus  within the 
prior [ADDRESS_1227652] their WI -NRS measurements daily in an electronic diary . These daily 
measures are  combined into weekly measures (Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Follow -up) 
by [CONTACT_878765]. Change from baseline is the difference between 
baseline and the post baseline weeks. Missing data will be imputed as outlined in 
Section  8.2. From this change from baseline the binary re sponder status (responder / 
non-responder) is created . A subject is a 4-point responder if t heir change from baseline is 
≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4). A 3- point respo nder is similarly defined . Subjects who 
withdraw from the study due to a lack of efficacy or require rescue therapy for treatment of 
worsening pruritus within four weeks prior to the timepoint will be defined as non-responder s regardless of their change from baseline.  
The daily WI-NRS endpoint (change from baseline in  daily WI -NRS scores through Week 2) 
is the change between the baseline WI -NRS (same baseline as the weekly measures) and the 
daily measures over the first two weeks.   
8.8.2 Primary Efficacy  
The WI-NRS 4-point responder rate at Week 10 (primary endpoint) will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570] . The difference in responder rate s between treatment arms will be tested 
using a CMH
 test controlling for the ‘as randomized’ stratification  factor s. Conceptually t he 
hypotheses being tested are:

Version 3.0   Page 52 9.8 Records and Electronic Case Report Forms  
All study data except central laboratory, PK, IWRS, eDiary , and ECG data will be recorded 
in an eCRF system (note: collection of central laboratory and PK blood draws will be 
recorded in the eCRF). Data will be entered at the site by [CONTACT_878766]. All source documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the subject’s medical records.  eCRFs will be completed for every subject screened 
in the study. 
The study monitor will review all eCRFs in detail and will have access to participant medical 
records, laboratory data, and other source documentation to allow required eCRF fields to be 
verified by [CONTACT_112099]. 
Data consistency and plausibility checks agains t data entered into the eCRF will be included 
in the eCRF system. Data corrections can be performed in the eCRFs by [CONTACT_779]. For each 
instance of data modification, the system requires a reason for change. The system keeps a full audit trail of the data v alues, the date and time of modification, and the electronic 
signature [CONTACT_247080]. 
After a full review of the eCRFs by [CONTACT_247076], the investigator will review, sign, and approve the subject’s eCRF. All 
essential documents, source data, clinical records, and laboratory data will be retained by [CONTACT_357549] E6 guideline and the site’s data retention policies. These records must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_1034], monitor, and regulatory authorities. 
Further detail regarding data management and eCRFs is included in the Data Management 
Plan.

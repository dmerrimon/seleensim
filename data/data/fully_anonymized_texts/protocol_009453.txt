Protocol No:  LOCK-IT-100 Investigators: Multicenter Study centers:  Up to 85 centers in the US Study duration:  Subjects will be followed until a CRBSI has occurred, the catheter is removed, the subject withdraws, or the study is ended. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Neutrolin® as a catheter lock solution (CLS) for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in subjects receiving hemodialysis (HD) for the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) when compared with heparin 4,000 USP Units/4 mL (1,000 USP Units/mL). The study will demonstrate whether Neutrolin® is superior to the active control heparin in reducing the incidence of CRBSI.   Study Design:  This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel-arm, multicenter study. Approximately 900 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Neutrolin® or the active control heparin (Heparin sodium USP 1,000 units/mL, Benzyl alcohol 9.45 mg/mL and Sodium chloride 9.0 mg/mL) as a CLS.  Neutrolin® or heparin will be instilled into central venous HD catheters at the discontinuation of all dialysis sessions and will be withdrawn prior to the initiation of the next dialysis session.   All subjects will receive standard of care consistent with clinical practice guidelines recommended by [CONTACT_818298], care and use of central venous catheters (CVC) for HD therapy.  Number of subjects planned and assignment to treatment:  Approximately 900 randomized subjects are planned for this trial.  In this study, one-half of the subjects (450 subjects) will receive Neutrolin® and the other half will receive heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL) with benzyl alcohol preservative as a comparator. Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks without

For the purpose of this blinded study, the term investigational product will refer to either Neutrolin® or the comparator. Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion and exclusion: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) with ESRD undergoing chronic HD with a permanent, tunneled silicone or polyurethane catheter that has demonstrated the ability to achieve a minimum blood flow of at least 250 mL/min for at least two consecutive dialysis sessions to enable successful HD. Subjects may not be entered into this trial if they have been treated with antibiotics within [ADDRESS_1133203], dose and mode of administration:  Neutrolin® and the active control will be packaged in identical vials, and will be used as a catheter locking solution for HD catheters in the following manner: • Day 1 (day of first administration of blinded, randomized therapy): following randomization and entry into the trial, instill CLS following the index HD epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], as described in the protocol; • Subsequent HD sessions: CLS will be removed prior to HD and instilled in the catheter following the HD session, as described in the protocol. Duration of treatment:  Subjects are to be followed from randomization until either:  • The development of a CRBSI; • Withdrawal from the study; • Catheter removal; or  • The end of the study, whichever occurs first.   The study has been designed to continue until approximately [ADDRESS_1133204] experienced a CRBSI. It is expected that some subjects may be treated for 2 years or more.  Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration:  Heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL) as a CLS for the active control.  Criteria for evaluation: Primary endpoint:  Time to CRBSI: The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Neutrolin® as a CLS in ESRD subjects undergoing HD treatment using a permanent, cuffed, tunneled

The study will evaluate whether Neutrolin® is superior to the active control heparin by [CONTACT_818299]. The definition of CRBSI used in this study requires that the same organism is grown from at least one blood culture from: • a peripheral site or bloodline sample and • either the arterial or venous catheter hub (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis).     Blood cultures must be taken from two sites to enhance the validity of the culture testing results. One aerobic and [ADDRESS_1133205] has clinical symptoms, while on or off dialysis, blood cultures will be obtained using peripheral venipuncture from a source not intended for future vascular access, and the venous or arterial hub of the HD CVC (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood line if on dialysis). If a peripheral site is not available, as soon as the patient is evaluated, blood cultures can be obtained from both the venous and arterial hubs of the HD CVC (or the dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis), preferably before the study subject receives antibiotics.  Ten to twenty mL of blood should be collected, without discarding any of the CLS.      Necessary clinical indication for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818260]:  One of the following symptoms: • Fever (defined as ≥37.8° C)  or • Rigors, defined as shivering from a feeling of being cold, often with copi[INVESTIGATOR_818261], as documented by a medical professional  OR two or more of the following symptoms:   • Tachycardia defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute  • Tachypnea, as defined as a RR greater than 24 breaths per minute

All attempts will be made to document as many signs and/or symptoms as possible at the time of suspected CRBSI.    An investigator may choose to obtain blood cultures on other suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818262], but the CRBSI case definition requires the clinical indication for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818263]. An alternate source of infection should not be clinically suspected.  Clinical Adjudication Committee While sites will seek to identify that a CRBSI is present and will be responsible for collecting the clinical data and blood cultures as outlined in the protocol, each case will be reviewed by a Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) for the final assessment of CRBSI status.  The CAC is a multi-disciplinary committee of specialists who will review both the clinical documentation as well as the blood culture results to determine if the case is a CRBSI.  However, because the CAC determination is based on data obtained from the clinical sites, and the review cannot be initiated without blood culture results, it is imperative that the sites follow the protocol definition of CRBSI, and collect blood cultures when a CRBSI is suspected.  Secondary Endpoints   1. Catheter Removal: Catheter removal for any reason, for example as a result of CRBSI, catheter malfunction, or the catheter is no longer needed for hemodialysis, during the follow up period of the trial. 2. Catheter Patency: Loss of catheter patency following enrollment in the study. Loss of catheter patency is defined as required use of a tissue plasminogen activating factor (tPA) or removal of catheter due to dysfunction.

Primary effectiveness analysis:  CRBSI The time to CRBSI will be compared between the treatment arms using a log-rank test at a 2-sided 5% alpha level.  The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the risk of CRBSI over time between the two treatment groups.  Subjects will be treated as censored in this analysis if the catheter is removed for reasons other than CRBSI (e.g., catheter removed because no longer required) or follow-up for CRBSI discontinues.  The primary analysis will be based upon the Full Analysis Population defined as randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of assigned treatment.  While testing will be based upon the log-rank test, the estimated treatment effect will be the incidence of CRBSI calculated as the number of subjects with a CRBSI epi[INVESTIGATOR_818264]-up over subjects (follow-up will be based upon the same time as used for the log-rank test).  The rate will be presented as the event rate per 1,000 days with  95% confidence interval presented for the comparison of rates between the treatment arms.  This confidence interval will be derived assuming that the number of days until CRBSI follows an exponential distribution.  Similar methods of analysis will be used to estimate the overall rate of catheter loss for any reason and the rate of loss of catheter patency. The fixed sequence testing procedure will be used for the comparison of the two treatments with respect to the effectiveness endpoints.  Therefore, the analysis comparing the two treatments for catheter loss for any reason will be formally conducted only if the analysis for the primary effectiveness endpoint yields a statistically significant result favoring Neutrolin®, and the analysis comparing the two treatments for loss of patency will be formally conducted only if the analysis for catheter loss for any reason also yields a statistically significant result favoring Neutrolin®.

  Page 15 of 67 2.0         INTRODUCTION 2.1          CLINICAL NEED FOR PREVENTION OF CATHETER-RELATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS  As of December 31, 2010, there were 593,086 End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.), of whom 383,992 were receiving hemodialysis (HD) therapy [1]. For patients on HD, the arteriovenous fistula is the best possible vascular access, due to its high blood flow, low complication rate and longevity [2].  Because of these characteristics the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and ESRD networks implemented a national vascular access improvement process called “Fistula First” in 2003 [3].  Although this program has increased the numbers of fistulas in both prevalent (patients currently receiving chronic dialysis) and incident (patients starting chronic dialysis) HD patients, an unintended consequence has been to increase the number of patients using central venous catheters (CVC) as their primary source of vascular access.  In 2006, 82% of patients in the US started chronic HD with a CVC, while more than 25% of prevalent HD patients used a CVC as their primary vascular access [4]. Infection is the second most common cause of death in HD patients, and the presence of a CVC is a significant risk factor for infection-associated mortality [5, 6].  The frequency of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) generally ranges between 2 and 5.5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/1,000 catheter days, which equates to approximately 1 or 2 infections/year in CVC-dependent patients [5, 7].  Given the current prevalent HD population, it is estimated that there are up to 160,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_818267]/year in catheter-dependent patients, and that up to 20% require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818268], septic arthritis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_115909], osteomyelitis or severe sepsis [6, 7].  A single epi[INVESTIGATOR_818269]-related CRBSI in the U.S. has been estimated to cost up to $45,000, and the aggregate yearly cost for all epi[INVESTIGATOR_818270] $800 million [3, 7]. The pathogenesis of CRBSI in CVC-dependent patients is believed to be due to bacterial colonization of the CVC due to biofilm formation [7-9].  Biofilm forms rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], usually within 24 hours in all CVCs, and represents a complex bacterial community embedded in a film made up of polysaccharides, minerals and bacteria [8, 10]. Biofilm protects bacteria and is essential for the virulence of most organisms [10].  In HD CVCs, it is recognized that colonization of the catheter occurs commonly, but does not cause overt symptoms or sepsis until reaching a critical colony count [11]. It also appears that bacterial colonization of biofilm can induce chronic inflammation as manifest by [CONTACT_818300] [9, 12].  Current catheter use is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality [3, 13].  All-cause mortality is increased 2-3 fold in patients with CVCs, and is reduced by [CONTACT_2902] 50% in patients that switch from a CVC to either a fistula or graft [4].  Additionally, the relative risk of infection-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818271] 2-3 fold, and even cardiovascular mortality is increased in this population [3-5, 13].  Chronic inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and may be the reason that cardiovascular mortality is increased in HD patients with CVCs [4, 13, 14].  CVC use is also associated with catheter malfunction and thrombosis, central 
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page 16 of 67 venous stenosis, reduced quality of life, greater risk for inadequate dialysis, and both local and systemic infection [3, 4]. Given the significant morbidity, mortality and cost associated with CRBSI in CVC-dependent patients, it is obvious why prevention of CRBSI is considered one of the most important unmet medical needs in the dialysis population [7, 15].  2.[ADDRESS_1133213] of catheter care is designed to minimize CRBSI and catheter dysfunction due to thrombosis.  This generally involves: • Locking the CVC interdialytically with a heparin-saline solution • Infection control precautions are taken pre- and post-HD treatment to prevent contamination of the exit site and catheter hub • Per HD organization-specific policy and procedure if a dressing is ordered by [CONTACT_099], infection control precautions are taken when catheter dressings are changed around the catheter • In extremely rare situations, an antibiotic lock might be used for patients with a history of intercurrent CVC infection, particularly if a CVC is the last vascular access possible for the patient. In the US, heparin is the current standard of care as a CLS to prevent thrombosis.  Although there are no large randomized controlled trials supporting a specific dose, heparin has historically been used at a concentration of 5,000 USP Units/mL, and more recently at 1,000 USP Units/mL, with the amount of heparin solution instilled matched to the catheter filling volume [16].  Recently, the American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology issued a guidance document recommending the use of 1,000 u/mL heparin (or 4.0% citrate) as the standard CLS, and this standard has been widely adopted in U.S. dialysis units [17].  While heparin is generally considered effective to maintain catheter patency, bacteria such as staphylococcal species survive and commonly create a biofilm in heparin-locked catheters.  It is thought that the preservatives in commercially available heparin solutions may provide some degree of antimicrobial activity, but current rates of CRBSI suggests that it has minimal antimicrobial activity [18]. Heparin, however, does not have any anti-infective properties. The search for a locking solution that would contain both anti-thrombotic and anti-infective properties has been ongoing for decades.  Antibiotic solutions have been tried but the inevitable growth of resistant bacterial species associated with their prolonged use has limited enthusiasm for their use for prophylaxis against CRBSIs.  Concentrated 30% citrate, functions as both an anti-coagulant and anti-infective agent, but when flushing the catheter lock, it may lead to cardiac arrhythmias by [CONTACT_818301]. While aspi[INVESTIGATOR_818272], flushing of catheter lock occurs when either 1) clots or fibrin make aspi[INVESTIGATOR_818273], 2) lapses in medical protocol inevitably occur, or 3) IV access is urgent and medical personnel who are not familiar with hemodialysis do not aspi[INVESTIGATOR_818274]. Furthermore, catheter overfills at the time of locking and/or subsequent leakage 
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page [ADDRESS_1133214] potential [4].  During the last [ADDRESS_1133215] been a number of small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of antimicrobial CLS in reducing CRBSI [7, 12].  Five of these studies used antibiotics, one used 30% citrate and the other used taurolidine/citrate. Although they appeared to be effective in the short-term, traditional antibiotic CLS have the risk of bacterial resistance or systemic toxicity, and 30% citrate may represent a safety risk [7].  Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern, and dialysis patients are among those at highest risk for resistant infections.  In 2005, just over 15% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were seen in dialysis patients [15].  The portion of the HD population at greatest risk appears to be those using CVCs. The same 2005 reports shows that approximately 85% of HD patients with MRSA infections had an invasive device or catheter in place at the time of the infection [15]. The long-term use of prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotics, such as vancomycin, is a risk factor for development of staphylococcal subpopulations with decreased susceptibility against glycopeptide antibiotics, particularly in the patient populations with devices such as CVCs [19].  This data reflects that it will be important to control CRBSIs in a manner that limits the likelihood of greater antimicrobial resistance in the HD patient population.  CLS are also used to reduce the rate of catheter dysfunction due to thrombosis.  Catheter dysfunction due to thrombosis can be treated by [CONTACT_818302] a thrombolytic agent (such as urokinase or tPA) into the catheter lumen [4].  Ultimately, if all interventions are unsuccessful, the occluded catheter is exchanged or replaced. Based upon current clinical evidence, a product possessing the following characteristics would be an optimal CLS: • Broad spectrum antibacterial/antifungal: – Prevent formation of biofilm  – Prevent CRBSI • Maintain catheter useable life: – Reduced need for thrombolytics and catheter replacement – Reduced need for catheter removal due to CRBSI • Maintain adequate flow rate: – Maximal  Qb >300 mL/min to ensure effective dialysis • Safe: – No bleeding risk – Lack of significant exposure to the systemic circulation • Does not promote emergence of resistant bacterial infections.

  Page 18 of 67 Thus, to solve this problem, CorMedix has proposed a catheter locking solution (Neutrolin®) consisting of a combination of:  • Taurolidine as an anti-infective • Heparin in standard concentrations as an anticoagulant and  • Citrate in relatively low doses to adjust the pH and enhance the solubility of Taurolidine in solution. Neutrolin® (composed of taurolidine 1.35%, citrate 3.5%, and heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL)) is a novel antimicrobial and anticoagulant solution, which will potentially satisfy these characteristics.  Taurolidine is a non-toxic, broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-fungal compound that has also been demonstrated to prevent biofilm formation [18, 20]. Taurolidine does not have any known anticoagulant properties. Indeed, early studies of Taurolidine with the addition of citrate as a catheter lock, but without the addition of heparin, were associated with higher rates of catheter thrombosis than those obtained in patients using standard heparin locks. These preliminary observations prompted the addition of heparin to the Taurolidine-citrate lock as noted above.  Two RCTs and considerable experiential data have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of taurolidine and citrate when used as a CLS to prevent CRBSI [21-24]. The most extensive information to date on the risk reduction that might be expected in the current study is perhaps that provided by [CONTACT_588216] [25].   In their study that included 158 Staphylococcal bacteremia events in 135,446 catheter-days among tunneled central venous catheter patients, they found a 56% reduction in risk with respect to Staphylococcal bacteremia rates when 5000 IU/ml of heparin was replaced with 1.35% taurolidine/4% citrate/500 IU/ml heparin (p=0.004).  An observational study by [CONTACT_818303] [26]. similarly found a  59% reduction in risk of bacteremia when comparing 106 patients (12,036 catheter-days) treated with 1.35% taurolidine/4% citrate/500 IU/ml heparin to 34 patients (6,471 catheter-days) treated with 5000 IU/ml of heparin. In the past decade, several CLS containing antimicrobial agents have been marketed in countries outside of the US.  CorMedix is not aware of any of these products being discontinued or withdrawn for safety-related reasons from any country where they are marketed.  These products contain one, two or all three active ingredients of Neutrolin®.  These products are listed Table 1.

  Page 20 of 67 2.3 OVERVIEW AND RATIONALE FOR USE OF NEUTROLIN® AS A CATHETER LOCK SOLUTION  Neutrolin®, as noted above, is comprised of 1.35% taurolidine, 3.5% citrate, and heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).  Taurolidine is a derivative of aminosulfonamide-taurinamide, and is a unique, non-toxic compound with both anti-adherence and antimicrobial properties against a broad range of bacteria and fungi.  Additionally, studies have also shown that taurolidine inhibits Staphylococcus coagulase (a clotting activator) and other clotting pathways, which may be of further benefit in the maintenance of catheter patency.  The antimicrobial properties of taurolidine are hypothesized to be related to its methylol transfer groups that bind irreversibly to bacterial or fungal cell walls.[18]  In vitro experiments have shown taurolidine to be efficacious in eradicating catheter biofilm caused by a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as Candida albicans.[18] Citrate is an effective anticoagulant [27].  Citrate acts as a chelating agent, in particular binding calcium and magnesium.  Citrate removes locally available calcium that is required to complete the coagulation cascade. Given this mechanism, the FDA warned against widespread use of citrate at higher concentrations due to the risk of hypocalcemia, when a patient died of cardiac arrest after an inadvertent systemic instillation of 46.7% citrate [28]. Neutrolin® contains 3.5% citrate which would be safe even under the worst-case assumptions for inadvertent instillation and subsequent effects on serum calcium. [29, 30] The concentration of heparin in Neutrolin® is 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL), which is now widely used as standard of care in most U.S. dialysis centers.  It is thought that this dose will provide a complementary anticoagulation effect to citrate, while reducing the risk that would be associated with inadvertent systemic administration of higher doses of heparin. The active control in this trial is heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).  The effectiveness and safety of Neutrolin® as a CLS in subjects with a tunneled silicone or polyurethane HD catheter is being studied for the following reasons:  1. There is a critical unmet medical need to reduce the incidence of CRBSI 2. There is substantial clinical experience with taurolidine/citrate ± heparin CLS – they are currently used extensively in many European countries for this indication, and for which there is considerable safety and effectiveness data 3. Ease of use – instillation methodology is identical to current heparin lock solutions used in clinical practice 4. Good safety profile in the case of inadvertent systemic administration – large doses of taurolidine given as a systemic infusion have shown no measurable effect in large randomized trials, and there is no known systemic activity on the coagulation system or on routine laboratory measurements. [31] The other active ingredients (citrate and heparin) are at low concentrations that would not be expected to cause significant systemic risk

The potential to prevent or reduce colonization of bacteria and fungi within the catheter lumen, thereby [CONTACT_818304] a microbial biofilm on the luminal surface and  7. The potential to reduce inflammation associated with biofilm formation on HD catheters. [32] Taurolidine has been used since the 1970’s in Europe as an antimicrobial lavage and gel.  A solution similar to Neutrolin® (without heparin) was used in combination with the Dialock Hemodialysis Access Device, an implantable hemodialysis access port, in a clinical trial of HD subjects in [LOCATION_013], performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Klaus Sodemann.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_818275] 70 subjects over a two year period, with very favorable results [20].  In a separate study, [CONTACT_818348] described his anecdotal experience treating 53 HD catheter subjects with a taurolidine, citrate CLS combination, which also showed an extremely low rate of CRBSI [22].  A CLS with the active ingredients 1.35% taurolidine, 4% citrate, and heparin (100 or 500 USP Units/mL) is currently marketed in Europe and the Middle East (TauroLock®). A solution of Taurolidine citrate was granted the CE mark in 2004 and is sold by [CONTACT_818305]-Implant GmbH; the manufacturer of a Taurolidine locking solution for the former Biolink.  Subsequently, Tauro-Implant launched a solution containing Taurolidine-citrate and heparin in 2007.  CorMedix obtained a CE mark approval for its Taurolidine-Citrate-heparin product (Neutrolin) on July 5, 2013.  Neutrolin was granted a CE mark as a Class III Drug-Device with separate reviews by [CONTACT_818306]-SUD [LOCATION_013].  It has been in commercial distribution in [LOCATION_013] since December 2013.  Neutrolin was initially approved for use in the prevention of CRBSI and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients using a tunneled, cuffed central venous catheter for vascular access.   On September 10, 2014, CorMedix was granted label expansion to include approval for additional indications for use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, IV hydration and IV medications via central venous catheters.  The expansion also included patients receiving medication and IV fluids via central venous catheters in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgent care centers).  An indication for use in total parenteral nutrition was also approved. A feasibility trial using taurolidine 1.35% and citrate 3.5% (without heparin) as a CLS in ESRD subjects undergoing HD via a CVC was conducted in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_818307] [33].  This trial was performed to evaluate the incidence of CRBSI when taurolidine/citrate solution was used as a CLS in HD catheters over a 90-day period.  The study was a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, single arm feasibility study conducted at two centers, and was designed to evaluate the preliminary safety and potential effectiveness of taurolidine/citrate solution to reduce the incidence of CRBSI in subjects using CVCs.   The results of the study suggested that taurolidine/citrate solution had significant antimicrobial effects.  In 1,679 catheter days of follow-up, there was only a single 
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page 22 of 67 epi[INVESTIGATOR_818276]-related bacteremia.  These results were compared to three other bodies of data: 1) infection rates reported from the literature; 2) each subject’s own experience in their previous 90 days (when only heparin was used as the CLS); and 3) a concurrent cohort of 30 subjects at the Principal Investigator’s dialysis center in whom only heparin was used to lock their CVCs.  In comparison to each of these groups, the taurolidine/citrate treated subjects had a much lower rate of CRBSI. The study also evaluated access patency and the incidence of serious adverse events.   All adverse events reported in the study were reviewed by [CONTACT_818308], if any.  No serious adverse events, apart from the single epi[INVESTIGATOR_818277], were observed in the taurolidine/citrate-treated subjects. Access patency rates were evaluated by [CONTACT_818309], and the requirement for use of thrombolytic therapy.  Freedom from catheter removal represents the overall effectiveness of maintaining the subject’s catheter for use as an effective HD access.  Catheter removal in the taurolidine/citrate group was similar to literature reports and to concurrent HD subjects at the Principal Investigator’s institution who were receiving standard heparin locks.  Thrombolytic intervention, however, was higher than expected in the taurolidine/citrate group.  For the current trial, the taurolidine/citrate solution has been optimized by [CONTACT_818310] (adjusted the pH from 5.1-5.6 to the current pH of 5.8-6.3).  In vitro studies have demonstrated that the optimized pH reduces taurolidine-citrate interactions with red blood cells that may have led to clot formation in the earlier trial.  Additionally, in vitro studies as well as experiential clinical data have suggested that at least some subjects benefit from the inclusion of heparin to the locking solution, [23, 24] to complement the antithrombotic properties of citrate. Therefore, heparin is included in the Neutrolin® formulation. As in the previous study, Neutrolin® is intended to be used in a manner identical to a conventional heparin CLS, and will be instilled into the HD catheter at the discontinuation of each dialysis session and removed prior to the initiation of the next dialysis session.  The control arms for this trial will be heparin at a concentration of heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).  Subjects in both study arms will have the CLS instilled into their catheters in a volume equal to the catheter fill volume.  Both the investigational lock solution and the control lock solution are to be withdrawn prior to initiating the next dialysis session. 2.4         SAFETY OF NEUTROLIN® The three active ingredients in Neutrolin® (1.35% taurolidine, 3.5% citrate, and heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL)) have been evaluated in pre-clinical studies conducted to assess their stability in solution (data on file). These studies evaluated the active ingredients at various concentrations and conditions with regards to physical and chemical compatibility, biocompatibility, impact on effectiveness for microbial growth inhibition, and impact on anticoagulant properties.  These pre-clinical in vitro studies demonstrated that the solutions are physically and chemically stable when mixed at 
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page [ADDRESS_1133216] the ability of the solution components to prevent coagulation. In clinical trials using a taurolidine/citrate CLS solution without heparin, an increased need for thrombolytic treatment has been reported in some, but not all studies; however, the rate of catheter replacement due to thrombotic catheter dysfunction has not been different in any of the studies [20, 21, 23, 24, 34].  Based upon discussions with numerous users of the taurolidine/citrate CLS available in the EU, we believe that at least certain populations of HD patients do have an increased requirement for thrombolytic treatment when heparin is not included in the formulation. No other adverse events were associated with the use of the taurolidine/citrate CLS in these previous clinical trials or reports.   Taurolidine is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent and is commercially available in [LOCATION_013], Austria, Switzerland, Poland, and the Netherlands as a 2% solution (Taurolin® Geistlich Pharma AG, CH-6110 Wolhusen, Switzerland).  Taurolin® is intended for local use, particularly for intraperitoneal use and within the urinary bladder.  Intraperitoneal administration of taurolidine has been shown to significantly reduce morbidity associated with peritonitis [36].   Taurolidine has been given systemically to humans in doses up to 30 grams per day with no significant adverse outcomes [31].  The concentration of taurolidine in Neutrolin® is approximately 400 times less than what has been used previously without safety issues, and considered negligible from a safety perspective.  It should not be anticipated that taurolidine at 1.35% poses any risk in case of unintended bolus administration.  As noted previously, citrate is known to chelate calcium, and hypocalcemia is a known risk associated with the use of high concentrations of citrate (30% or greater).  4% citrate (alone) has been demonstrated to be equivalent to heparin as a CLS [29, 30] and is more than 10-fold lower than the concentration issued a warning by [CONTACT_1622] [28].  This low citrate concentration is regarded as safe in case of unintended bolus administration, as the citrate would be expected to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_818278] [20].  However, it is possible that mild hypocalcemia symptoms might be seen with rapid flushing of Neutrolin®, although such use is not anticipated or recommended [38]. When used as a CLS, heparin has the potential to cause a prolongation of clotting times due to inadvertent escape from the catheter at instillation and between dialysis treatments.  Depending on the half-life of the heparin used, there could be an increased bleeding risk for 12-24 hours [16]. The heparin concentration in Neutrolin® is identical to the concentration currently used in clinical practice (1,000 USP Units/mL).  Therefore, the bleeding risk associated with inadvertent systemic administration of Neutrolin® should be no greater than current standard of care. When taurolidine/citrate is used as a CLS for CVCs in other indications where catheter flushing is routine, some subjects have reported an “unusual taste” following infusion, as well as pain with inadvertent injection into a peripheral vein [38]. 
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page [ADDRESS_1133217] been reported [38].  This is obviously a very different situation from the dosing, site of infusion and intended use compared with Neutrolin®. The HD catheters utilized in this study are commercially available, tunneled catheters made from silicone or polyurethane.  Testing has been performed to demonstrate the compatibility of Neutrolin® ingredients with silicone or polyurethane materials to enable the product to be used with any HD catheter that is made of one of these two materials (data on file).  The catheters are not considered part of the drug under investigation and consequently will not be supplied by [CONTACT_818311]. Since the initial CE mark approval in [LOCATION_013] in 2013, there has been no serious or unexpected adverse events reported.  As part of CorMedix's post approval surveillance program or what the company refers to as the Neutrolin Use Monitoring Program (NUMP), 163 patients on Hemodialysis with chronic cuffed central venous catheter (CVCs), who are being treated with Neutrolin as their catheter lock solution, are being followed.  So far, with [ADDRESS_1133218] been reported.  Occasionally, patients report a mild transient change in taste, which resolves in a few minutes.  Based on the prevalence data found in the literature, 2.5-5.5 infections per 1000 dialysis patient days would be expected [5]. No thrombosis or clots were observed in the patient population where, based on information in the literature, we would have expected to see 6.7-26.6/1000 dialysis patient days in a similar number of dialysis patients receiving HD with CVCs over that same time period [40]. 2.5         RATIONALE FOR THE FORMULATION OF NEUTROLIN®  Neutrolin® is a CLS that has been developed for use with vascular access devices.  Neutrolin® is a proprietary solution containing 1.35% taurolidine, 3.5% citrate and heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL), as active ingredients.  The Neutrolin® solution, as well as the heparin control solution, depending on treatment group, is to be instilled into CVCs for subjects undergoing HD, in a volume equal to the manufacturer’s stated catheter lumen volume.  Thus, the instilled solutions are not intended to be infused systemically (although the complete contents of each catheter lumen containing Neutrolin® could be injected without safety concerns). This inadvertent intravenous dose would be [ADDRESS_1133219] spectrum, bactericidal, anti-biofilm and anti-adherence properties. Additional benefits include a lack of cross-resistance to commonly used antibiotics. As previously noted, both citrate and heparin are effective anticoagulants.  The concentrations of the active ingredients in the Neutrolin® solution are expected to effectively prevent (or increase the time to) catheter-related bloodstream infection, while maintaining catheter patency in a manner that is not inferior to heparin.  Further, it is expected that the active ingredients at the planned concentrations will be safe within the planned subject population.

  Page 25 of 67 3.0        STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1         PRIMARY OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Neutrolin® as a catheter lock solution (CLS) for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in subjects receiving hemodialysis (HD) for the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) when compared with heparin 4,000 USP Units/4 mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).  The study will demonstrate whether Neutrolin® is superior to the active control heparin in reducing the incidence of CRBSI.   3.2         SAFETY OBJECTIVES The safety objectives of this study are to characterize any increased risks associated with the use of Neutrolin® used as a CLS with respect to adverse events and laboratory assessments as well as catheter removal for reasons other than CRBSI.   3.3         PRIMARY ENDPOINT CRBSI is defined as follows:  CRBSI requires that the same organism is grown from at least one blood culture from: • a peripheral site or bloodline sample and • either the arterial or venous catheter hub (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis)  Blood culture procedures are outlined in Section 7.1.4.  Necessary clinical indication for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818260]:  One of the following symptoms: • Fever (defined as ≥37.8° C)  or • Rigors, defined as shivering from a feeling of being cold, often with copi[INVESTIGATOR_818261], as documented by a medical professional  OR two or more of the following symptoms:   • Tachycardia defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute  • Tachypnea, as defined as a RR greater than 24 breaths per minute • Low blood pressure as defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90, as measured by a clinician (RN or MD) with a BP cuff, or a decrease in blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg • An obvious change in mental status from previously documented baseline.   
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page 26 of 67 All attempts will be made to document as many signs and/or symptoms as possible at the time of suspected CRBSI.    An investigator may choose to obtain blood cultures on other suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818262], but the CRBSI case definition requires the clinical indication for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818263].  If the subject has clinical symptoms, while on or off dialysis, blood cultures will be obtained using peripheral venipuncture from a source not intended for future vascular access, and the venous or arterial hub of the HD CVC (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood line if on dialysis). If a peripheral site is not available, as soon as the patient is evaluated, blood cultures can be obtained from both the venous and arterial hubs of the HD CVC (or the dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis), preferably before the study subject receives antibiotics.  Ten to twenty mL of blood should be collected, without discarding any of the CLS.    3.3.1 Clinical Adjudication Committee   While sites will seek to identify that a CRBSI is present and will be responsible for collecting the clinical data and blood cultures as outlined in the protocol, each case will be reviewed by a Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) for the final assessment of CRBSI status.  The CAC is a multi-disciplinary committee of specialists who will review both the clinical documentation as well as the blood culture results to determine if the case is a CRBSI.  However, because the CAC determination is based on data obtained from the clinical sites, and the review cannot be initiated without blood culture results, it is imperative that the sites follow the protocol definition of CRBSI, and collect blood cultures when a CRBSI is suspected.

The primary responsibilities of the DSMB will be to monitor subject safety and study conduct and to oversee the interim analysis.  The DSMB will have access to both unblinded safety and efficacy data. The DSMB will be independent of the sponsor and will consist of [ADDRESS_1133222] occurred. If statistical significance is obtained for the primary efficacy endpoint, the recommendation will be to stop the study early for efficacy. If the futility analysis indicates that it is futile to continue the study, the recommendation will be to stop the study early for futility. In either case, the DSMB will report its recommendation only to the CorMedix Executive Committee, which will make the final decision as to whether or not to stop the study in consultation with FDA.  An independent statistical team will prepare the data summaries for DSMB review.  No additional study (or sponsor) staff will have access to the unblinded DSMB summaries.    A DSMB charter with standard operating procedures to control potential biases will be developed and implemented prior to any data analysis.

  Page 28 of 67  4.1.3 Clinical Adjudication Committee A Clinical Adjudication Committee (CAC) will be formed to review each case of suspected CRBSI and make a final determination of the case status, after a thorough review of the clinical and laboratory data obtained for each suspected case.  The CAC will consist of experts in the fields of nephrology and infectious disease.  The CAC will independently and critically assess the circumstances surrounding the suspected CRBSI event while remaining blinded to patient treatment assignment.  All study subjects, including those who completed the study prior to implementation of the CAC process, with one or more positive blood cultures (other than for coagulase negative Staphylococcus, which requires a confirmatory culture) will be adjudicated for the presence of a CRBSI event by [CONTACT_575826], which will remain blinded to treatment assignment. However, because the CAC determination is based data obtained from the investigative sites for suspected CRBSI, and the review cannot be initiated without blood culture results, it is imperative that the sites collected blood cultures when a CRBSI is suspected.  The results of the CAC adjudication will not be provided back to the investigator/site. 4.2         DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN This randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel-arm, multicenter study is designed to demonstrate whether the CLS Neutrolin® will reduce the occurrence of CRBSI. Safety and efficacy information, including maintenance of catheter patency and catheter loss, as well as adverse event occurrence will be evaluated against the active control heparin, which is the current standard CLS in [LOCATION_002] clinical practice.  All subjects will receive standard of care therapy consistent with current clinical practice guidelines and best practices. The population chosen for this study will be representative of the general HD patient population using CVCs as their vascular access. Further discussion of the study design is located within Section 5.

The investigator believes that for the subject’s best interest; or 2. For safety reasons (e.g., an adverse event) the subject should stop treatment; or  3. Subject’s request/withdrawal of consent The subject, if agreeable, will continue to be monitored for safety parameters for [ADDRESS_1133229]. At the end of the 28 day period after withdrawal (+7 days as needed for scheduling), subject should return to the site for a final safety visit, as outlined in 7.1.6. CorMedix reserves the right to close the investigational site, withdraw a subject (discontinue provision of blinded investigational product treatment), or terminate the study at any time (see Section 11.8). 5.3.[ADDRESS_1133230] should be administered at all visits starting from day 1 (date of randomization) through study completion unless contraindicated per investigator judgment.  Additionally, there may be cases where the subject cannot attend the study center for a regularly scheduled dialysis visit (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], travel out of town), requiring an investigational product interruption.  If more than [ADDRESS_1133231] administration interruption of more than 3 consecutive doses should be clearly noted within the source documents and in two study records – (1) on the investigational product  drug dosing CRF, and (2) on the interruption of investigational product CRF at the next monthly visit.

  Page 33 of 67 6.0          STUDY TREATMENTS 6.1         IDENTITY OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS  Neutrolin® is a unique formulation of taurolidine 1.35%, citrate 3.5%, and heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL). Neutrolin® CLS and heparin CLS will be packaged in identical vials. The catheter lock solution is to be instilled in catheters using a volume matching the fill volume of the hemodialysis catheter, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_818280] 3.6-5.0 mL.   Vials should be stored at controlled room temperature between 15 and 25° C, and should not be frozen.  All vials are single use only, and any leftover solution should be discarded according to the institution’s procedures for disposal of biohazardous waste. 6.2         BLINDING  The Neutrolin® lock solution will match the control lock solution with respect to volume, color, viscosity, and smell and will be packaged in identical containers (at an off-site, central facility). The label will remain affixed to the investigational product container and will contain all identifying information except for the identity of the drug contained therein (e.g., active investigational product or active control).  The blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. The blind should only be broken if specific emergency treatment would be dictated by [CONTACT_818313]. In such cases, a system will be in place for revealing assigned treatment. The blind should not be broken without consultation with the Medical Monitor. The date and reason for the unblinding must be documented.  6.3         TREATMENTS TO BE ADMINISTERED  Neutrolin® or active control (heparin, 1,000 USP Units/mL) will be used as a CLS as follows: 1. Flush each lumen with 10 mL of saline. 2. Withdraw CLS from the vial using a 3 mL or smaller syringe (to ensure accurate volume). Use one syringe for each lumen. 3. Instill CLS into the access device in a quantity sufficient to fill the catheter lumen. Consult the manufacturer’s instructions for specific fill volume. CLS is intended to remain inside the access device until the next hemodialysis treatment. 4. Prior to initiation of the next hemodialysis treatment, CLS should be withdrawn from the catheter and discarded according to the institution’s biohazardous waste policy.  Day 1 (day of randomization): Following HD treatment, Neutrolin® or heparin control solution will be instilled.

  Page 34 of 67 Subsequent dialysis sessions: the lock solution will be removed from the HD catheter (if possible) prior to the initiation of dialysis.  At the end of dialysis, Neutrolin® lock solution or heparin control will be instilled as described above. 6.4         METHOD OF ASSIGNING SUBJECTS TO TREATMENT GROUP  Central randomization will be used for this study.  Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks without additional stratification.  6.5         SELECTION OF NEUTROLIN® COMPOSITION AND CONTROL Neutrolin® is available in Europe and the Middle East with a choice of two concentrations of heparin.  For this study, the Neutrolin® formulation was selected to match the heparin content of standard care in the [LOCATION_002]. The active control in this trial is heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).  Although there is no uniform standard, 1,000 USP Units/mL heparin is used in most HD CVCs. [17, 41].  6.6         SELECTION AND TIMING OF THE CATHETER LOCK SOLUTION  As noted above, subjects will be randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion either to Neutrolin® or control group.  Given that Neutrolin® and heparin are used as CLS, they will be instilled in both limbs of the subject’s HD catheter at the completion of each dialysis session. The Neutrolin® or control lock solution will be removed prior to each dialysis treatment, and instilled as a fresh lock solution following each dialysis treatment. 6.7         PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY/PROCEDURES Prior and concomitant medications and procedures are recorded throughout the study, including 30 days prior to randomization, in the corresponding CRF. As part of routine medical care, the study nurse should inquire about any new medications and procedures at every routine dialysis visit.  Systemic antibiotic treatment (oral or parenteral) during the study is permitted if required for the treatment of infections documented not to be CRBSI (e.g., pneumonia, urinary tract infection, etc.).  Blood cultures should be taken prior to the administration of any systemic antibiotic or antifungal treatments, unless there is a documented microbiological cause other than CRBSI. Systemic antibiotic treatment is permitted as part of standard of care for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818281]. Randomized investigational product instillation in the HD catheter may continue while receiving systemic antibiotics and after completion of the antibiotic regimen.  Investigational product does not need to be interrupted.  Use of antibiotic therapy will be collected in the CRF.  All medications different from the investigational product (prescriptions or over-the-counter medications) and procedures administered 30 days prior to randomization, and 
CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page [ADDRESS_1133232] be documented in the concomitant therapy section of the CRF.  6.7.1       Prohibited Concomitant Medications The use of systemic antibiotics within 14 days prior to enrollment, as well as any thrombolytic treatment (i.e., tPA – Cathflo®) instilled in their current catheter within 30 days of randomization is prohibited, as outlined in the exclusion criteria (Section 5.2). Current requirement for systemic immunosuppression that would increase risk of infection; such as those described in section 5.[ADDRESS_1133233] requires treatment with a systemic immunosuppressant at doses higher than described in the exclusion criteria (Section 5.2; Exclusion Criteria 9) then the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  There are no other prohibited medications. 6.[ADDRESS_1133234] of care, careful consideration was given to current practice guidelines, clinical practice standards of care, and scientific evidence in support of particular treatments.  Guidelines established by [CONTACT_818314] [2, 42]. The definition of standard of care for this study is as follows: 1. All catheter and exit site care to be performed only by [CONTACT_818315]; 2. Conduct all catheter procedures following CDC best practices and/or facility standard operating procedures; 3. Asepsis will be maintained through preexisting protocol at the study site. For example, use 2% Chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol or acceptable alternative for cutaneous antisepsis unless the subject has a history of sensitivity, in which case Chlorhexidine aqueous or 70% ethanol should be used; 4. Use only sterile gauze or sterile semi-permeable transparent dressings to cover the catheter site. 6.[ADDRESS_1133235] of care HD treatment according to the prescribing physician’s prescription and current standards of care for each dialysis facility.  However, this prescription must be intended to provide the subject with a spKt/V of at least 1.2.

Assessment of a CRBSI should also occur under the following circumstances: the prescription of systemic antibiotic or antifungal therapy unless there is a documented microbiological source other than CRBSI, and at the time of catheter removal unless the subject is receiving systemic antibiotic or antifungal therapy or has received such therapy in the previous week.  Blood cultures for the assessment of a CRBSI should be obtained following the procedure documented below. Additionally, vital signs, blood glucose, CRP, procalcitonin, and leukocyte count should be obtained as part of the CRBSI assessment.    Blood cultures must be taken from two sites to enhance the validity of the culture testing results. One aerobic and [ADDRESS_1133244] has clinical symptoms, while on or off dialysis, blood cultures will be obtained using peripheral venipuncture from a source not intended for future vascular access, and the venous or arterial hub of the HD CVC (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood line if on dialysis). If a peripheral site is not available, as soon as the patient is evaluated, blood cultures can be obtained from both the venous and arterial hubs of the HD CVC (or the dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis), before the study subject receives antibiotics.  Ten to twenty mL of blood should be collected, without discarding any of the CLS.  Site of blood withdrawal (peripheral veinipuncture or catheter hub or dialysis circuit blood line) should be recorded in the CFR.  Blood cultures should be obtained using the following procedure:  • Wash hands and use appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves • Clean the arterial port with an alcohol prep pad, allow to dry, and avoid touching the arterial port after cleaning • Two Bact/Alert system blood culture bottles should be used – 1 for the aerobic culture, and 1 for the anaerobic culture for each site of blood sample collection (CVC/dialysis circuit or peripheral site) o Verify that the flip-off caps on the bottles are intact and aseptically remove the cap o Clean each bottle with an alcohol prep pad • Collect specimen in the aerobic bottle first o Hold bottle upright and ensure that the bottle remains upright at all times to prevent back flow of culture media into the dialysis arterial line o Peel open the BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood collection Set and thread the luer end of the tubing into the vacutainer holder

CRBSI is the primary endpoint for this trial.   For the purposes of this study, once the subject has been randomized and has received at least one instillation of the assigned lock solution, all epi[INVESTIGATOR_818283] [IP_ADDRESS] will be considered definite epi[INVESTIGATOR_818267].  Once the infection is confirmed as a CRBSI, the subject will be considered to have satisfied the infection endpoint and will be considered to have completed the study.  The subject will receive standard of care therapy for CRBSI and the decision as to removal of the catheter will be left to the PI, although KDOQI guidelines should be followed.

  Page 46 of 67 [IP_ADDRESS]       Definition of CRBSI CRBSI is defined for this trial as follows: CRBSI requires that the same organism is grown from at least one blood culture from: • a peripheral site or bloodline sample and • either the arterial or venous catheter hub (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis).     In the event that a peripheral sample is obtained, the cephalic vein will be avoided for preservation of future vascular access. Blood cultures must be taken from two sites to enhance the validity of the culture testing results. One aerobic and [ADDRESS_1133252] has clinical symptoms, while on or off dialysis, blood cultures will be obtained using peripheral venipuncture from a source not intended for future vascular access, and the venous or arterial hub of the HD CVC (or the venous or arterial dialysis circuit blood line if on dialysis). If a peripheral site is not available, as soon as the patient is evaluated, blood cultures can be obtained from both the venous and arterial hubs of the HD CVC (or the dialysis circuit blood lines if on dialysis), preferably before the study subject receives antibiotics.  Ten to twenty mL of blood should be collected, without discarding any of the CLS.    Necessary clinical indication for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_818260]:  One of the following symptoms: • Fever (defined as ≥37.8° C)  or • Rigors, defined as shivering from a feeling of being cold, often with copi[INVESTIGATOR_818261], as documented by a medical professional  OR two or more of the following symptoms:   • Tachycardia defined as a heart rate greater than 100 beats per minute  • Tachypnea, as defined as a RR greater than 24 breaths per minute • Low blood pressure as defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 90, as measured by a clinician (RN or MD) with a BP cuff, or a decrease in blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg • An obvious change in mental status from previously documented baseline    All attempts will be made to document as many signs and/or symptoms as possible at the time of suspected CRBSI.

The CAC is a multi-disciplinary committee of specialists who will review both the clinical documentation as well as the blood culture results to determine if the case is a CRBSI.  However, because the CAC determination is based on data obtained from the clinical sites, and the review cannot be initiated without blood culture results, it is imperative that the sites follow the protocol definition of CRBSI, and collect blood cultures when a CRBSI is suspected. 7.[ADDRESS_1133253] dose of IP.  Adverse events may include:  • Objective signs observed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_373847] • Subjective or objective signs/symptoms • Concomitant disease or accidents • Clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject in the course of a clinical study • Pre-existing conditions that worsen in severity or frequency or have new signs/symptoms associated with them. Other findings related to out-of-range laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, etc., considered not clinically significant are not to be recorded in the AE CRF page.  Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE) will be summarized in tables in the final study report. A treatment-emergent adverse event is an AE that starts or worsens after the subject’s first administration of investigational product.

CorMedix Inc Protocol Number: LOCK-IT-100  Confidential October 06, 2017 (Version 8)  
  Page 49 of 67 • Moderate:  Causing some limitations of usual activities; Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_14212].  Moderate experiences may cause some interference with functioning • Severe:  Causing inability to carry out usual activities; Events interrupt the subject’s normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. They are usually incapacitating • Life-threatening:   Subject was at immediate risk of death from the event.  ASSESSMENT OF AE OUTCOME The following definitions of AE outcomes will be used: • Recovered/Resolved • Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae • Recovering/Resolving • Not Recovered/Not Resolved • Fatal • Unknown.  CLINICAL FINDINGS Any significant clinical findings in the final examination, including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at the end of the subject’s participation in the study, will be followed until the condition returns to pre-study status or can be explained as not being related to investigational drug. This also applies to all AEs that continue at the Final Safety Visit. Any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or SAE that occurs prior to the Final Safety Visit or within [ADDRESS_1133255] will be followed until event resolution, or until, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], becomes stable.    SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAES) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_248422] (within 24 hours of notification) inform the Sponsor/CRO of all SAEs that occur in study subjects.  A SAE is any AE that meets at least one of following criteria:  • Is fatal • Is life-threatening, meaning the subject was, in the view of the PI, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form or progressed, might have caused death • Is a persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123324] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649616] 24 hours, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411208] (non-diagnostic) • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.

  Page 50 of 67 A SAE may also include events that are medically significant in the PI’s judgment including medically significant laboratory abnormalities. Other important medical events may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subjects and may require medical or surgical interventions to prevent one of the outcomes as listed as above in this definition.  For example, an important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_818287]-threatening conditions.  In general, medically significant events are those which require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. REPORTING OF SAES All SAEs will be collected starting the day of Informed Consent signature [INVESTIGATOR_107990] [ADDRESS_1133256] be reported to the Sponsor immediately upon discovery, by [CONTACT_818326] (Medidata/Rave), and by [CONTACT_818327], and, if necessary, by [CONTACT_818328].

Quality control will be applied to each stage of data handling.  The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability of the data: • Selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers • Investigator meeting(s) and review of protocol procedures and CRF completion with the investigator and associated personnel before enrolling any subjects and during the study as needed • Written instructions will be provided for collection, preparation, and shipment of laboratory samples, if appropriate • Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters • Site Initiation visit • Early site visits post-enrollment • Routine on-site monitoring visits • Review of CRFs for accuracy and completeness, resolution of discrepancies with the investigator or designee, as appropriate • Ongoing site communication and training  • Data management quality control checks • Continuous data acquisition and cleaning • Internal review of data • Quality control check of the final clinical study report.  In addition, CorMedix and the CRO Clinical Quality Assurance Department may conduct periodic audits of the study processes at the study site, central laboratories, or other vendors. Audits may also be conducted on the clinical database and final clinical study report. When audits are conducted, access must be authorized for all study related documents including medical history and concomitant medication documentation to authorized representatives of CorMedix or the CRO and regulatory authorities. 8.[ADDRESS_1133260]-initiation visit will usually be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun.

Specific items required as source documents will be reviewed with the investigator before the study. If data are recorded directly into the CRF, at a minimum there should be an entry in the medical record that each of the assessments was done, and by [CONTACT_818331].  Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying that the data recorded in the CRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review of CRF and source documents will be discussed with the investigational staff. CorMedix expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant investigational staff will be available, the source documentation will be available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study-related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.  8.[ADDRESS_1133262] recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

  Page 55 of 67 9.0     STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 9.1     DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE This trial has been designed to achieve 80% power for the comparison between treatment arms subject to the following specifications: testing will be conducted at a 2-sided overall 5% alpha level, Neutrolin® is associated with a 55% reduction in the risk (i.e., incidence) of CRBSI relative to the control arm, and one interim analysis will be performed at the midpoint of the trial with adjustment of the alpha level using the method of Pocock. Fifty-six CRBSI events in total will be needed to achieve the desired power, and the event rates will be monitored over the course of the trial to determine the times of the interim and final statistical analyses. It is expected that approximately 900 subjects will be randomized for this trial. 9.2    INTERIM ANALYSIS A DSMB will meet periodically to review the accumulating study data.  The primary purpose of these reviews is to monitor safety and data quality.    Additionally, the DSMB will oversee interim analyses for efficacy and for futility that will be performed when 28 CAC-adjudicated CRBSI events (1/2 of the total number of 56 events) have occurred. If statistical significance is obtained for the primary efficacy endpoint at this time, the recommendation will be to stop the study early for efficacy. If the futility analysis indicates that continuing the study would be futile, the recommendation will be to stop the study early for futility. In either case, the DSMB will report its recommendation only to the CorMedix Executive Committee, which will make the final decision as to whether or not to stop the study in consultation with the FDA.  9.[ADDRESS_1133263] one dose of study medication. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received.  It is expected that the Safety Population will be identical to the Full Analysis Population.

  Page [ADDRESS_1133264] CHARACTERISTICS Descriptive summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented by [CONTACT_818332].  Baseline characteristics will include a summary of the following: • Subject demographics including age, sex, race • Baseline disease characteristics • Pre-existing medical conditions • Prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 9.[ADDRESS_1133265] at an overall 2-sided 5% alpha level.  The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the risk of CRBSI over time between the two treatment groups.  Subjects will be treated as censored in this analysis if the catheter is removed for reasons other than CRBSI (e.g., catheter removed because no longer required) or follow-up is completed in the absence of CRBSI. Because an interim analysis for efficacy will be performed, the method of Pocock will be used to control the overall alpha level. Therefore, the nominal significance level at the interim and final statistical analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint will be 0.0294.    The primary analysis will be based upon the Full Analysis Population.  While testing will be based upon the log-rank test, the estimated treatment effect will be the incidence of CRBSI calculated as the number of subjects with a CRBSI epi[INVESTIGATOR_818293]-up over subjects (follow-up will be based upon the same time as used for the log-rank test).  The rate will be presented as the event rate per 1,000 days with 95% confidence interval for the comparison of rates between the treatment arms. This confidence interval will be derived assuming that the number of days until CRBSI

  Page 57 of 67 follows an exponential distribution.  The primary analysis will be repeated using all randomized subjects with available data.  In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed in which cases considered to be indeterminate by [CONTACT_818333].   9.7.1    Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints Similar methods of analysis will be used to estimate the overall rate of catheter loss for any reason and the rate of loss of catheter patency. Loss of catheter patency is defined as required use of a tissue plasminogen activating factor (tPA) or removal of catheter due to dysfunction. The fixed sequence testing procedure will be used for the comparison of the two treatments with respect to the effectiveness endpoints. Therefore, the analysis comparing the two treatments for catheter loss for any reason will be formally conducted only if the analysis for the primary effectiveness endpoint yields a statistically significant result favoring Neutrolin®, and the analysis comparing the two treatments for loss of patency will be formally conducted only if the analysis for catheter loss for any reason also yields a statistically significant result favoring Neutrolin®.  The reason for catheter loss will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  In addition to basic descriptive statistics, the rates per [ADDRESS_1133266]'s first administration of study CLS. All AEs, including treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), will be summarized by [CONTACT_6764], preferred term, and treatment group, with the number of subjects and percentage reporting the event.

Frequency (%) of TEAEs will be calculated for each body system, by [CONTACT_11702], by [CONTACT_1570]. The severity of the TEAEs and the relationship to study medication will be summarized for each body system and preferred term by [CONTACT_1570]. Withdrawals due to TEAEs will be summarized for each body system and preferred term by [CONTACT_1570]. 9.8.2    Clinical Laboratory Tests Descriptive statistics will be calculated for clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry) at applicable visits. Where applicable, changes from baseline will be summarized across treatment groups. The number and percentage of subjects with abnormal laboratory results will be provided.

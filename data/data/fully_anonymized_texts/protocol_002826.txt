 This study will evaluate the antihelmintic drug, niclosamide, as a potential 
treatment for mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19).  
Niclosamide, which has potent antiviral activity against single -stranded RNA 
viruses including coronaviruses, was proposed as an antiviral during the SARS 
outbreak in 2002 and has activity including SARS -CoV-2 where it was found to 
inhibit SARS coronavirus, SARS -CoV, in in vitro  studies and similarly structured 
RNA viruses (both in vitro  and in vivo ).  We hypothesize that the antiv iral activity 
of Niclosamide may be extended to COVID -19.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
The ongoing COVID -19 pandemic is an urgent public health crisis with few if any rapid and practical 
solutions.  The outbreak of COVID -19 has been declared to be a public health emergency of international 
concern by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO), and the development of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519193] -
spreading fatal COVID -[ADDRESS_673556] 
demonstrated potent antiviral activity  [1-3].  In a recent study, Niclosamide  exhibited antiviral activity 
against SARS -CoV-2, the strain responsible for the current COVID -19 pandemic  [3]. That niclosamide  has 
already demonstrated efficacy in specifically inhibiting SARS -CoV-2 replication in vitro is  incredibly 
promising.   
A recent study evaluated clinical samples from 73 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388988] -CoV-2 infection. In 39 
of those patients, their fecal samples tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 RNA, with 17 of those patients 
remaining SARS -CoV-2-positive in feces after becoming negative in respi[INVESTIGATOR_135608]  [29].  Taken 
together, this suggests that both the commonly accepted route of infection through the respi[INVESTIGATOR_519194] -19-related disease 
manifestations.  
While severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_214323] (SARS) coronavirus 2, SARS -CoV-2-infected patients most 
commonly present with fever, tiredness and dry cough; a subset of these patients present with 
gastrointestinal (GI) issues [2]. Importantly, a recent study found that fecal viral shedding conti nues 
nearly [ADDRESS_673557] serves as a viral reservoir and allows for prolonged COVID -19 infection and transmission  [4]. Given 
that SARS -CoV-2 is so highly contagious and can be easily spread by [CONTACT_519258][INVESTIGATOR_519195] -

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   6 critical need to develop practical COVID -19 intervention strategies to treat SARS -CoV-2 infection and to 
prevent person -to-person transmission . 
Repurposing reliable and effective drugs for COVID -19 therapy is not only a safer strategy but will also 
allow for more rapid introduction into clinical practice.  For this reason, we propose to u se the widely 
used antihelmintic drug, Niclosamide  for treatment of COVID -19.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
SARS -CoV-2 has been shown to invade human tissues via the angiotensin converting enzyme II receptor 
(ACE2), which is highly expressed on cell types found in various tissues  [30]. In a study to identify 
potential routes of infection for the SARS -CoV virus corresponding to the outbreak in China in 2002, a 
remarkable finding was the high surface expression of ACE2 protein on human lung alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_519196], the simple columnar epi[INVESTIGATOR_519197][30].   
This is not the first time that this small molecule (niclosamide ) has been proposed as a therapeutic for 
this specific application.  Shortly afte r the SARS outbreak in China in 2002 -2003, niclosamide  was tested 
for its potential use as an antiviral medication. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, niclosamide  was found 
to inhibit SARS coronavirus, SARS -CoV, in in vitro studies [14]. Later studies went on to evaluate its 
potential in combating coronavirus in vivo [31]. Fortunately, the SARS outbreak subsided rather quickly, 
and as a result, no future interventi ons were necessary.  
Multiple studies have studied the antiviral capacity of niclosamide  in treating other similarly structured 
pathogenic viruses.  During the outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV), another positive -sense RNA -based virus 
similar to the coronav irus family, Niclosamide  was again identified as a potential antiviral therapeutic, 
with ZIKV -inhibiting effects both in vitro [13] as well as in a humanized in vivo model of ZIKV -induced 
microcephaly [5]. Upon reviewing the literature, we found that niclosamide  was also able to inhibit 
production of a variety of viral strains [4, 7, 8, 10 -12, 15, 32], including adenovirus [10], dengue [4] and 
chikungunya virus [11]. Its mechanism of action in this capacity is to increase the pH within acidic 
endosomes of h ost cells, thereby [CONTACT_519259].  
In addition to its antihelmintic and antiviral properties, niclosamide  has also demonstrated anti -bacterial 
[8, 33, 34], anti -inflammatory [16, 17] and anti -cancer activity [18, 19, 23, 33, 35 -40]. Moreover , 
niclosamide  has also shown promise for treating respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] [14, 18, 20 -22] even functioning as a 
bronchodilator in an in vivo mouse model of asthma [21, 22].  
Niclosamide  has demonstrated efficacy as a cancer therapeutic in both animal mode ls [19, 36] as well as 
human clinical trials [23, 35]  which  suggests that in addition to potentially being efficacious in this anti -
COVID -[ADDRESS_673558] to halt or prevent infection in the less sick (or

Selker PI  01022021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   7 even in the uninfected), it would be monumental in terms of returning to normal life.   Because the drug 
is inexpensive and has few if any side effects, taking Niclosamide  prophylactically might help to prevent 
COVID -[ADDRESS_673559] immune system to better combat 
the disease.  
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
Niclosamide has been  used since mid of the 1960s as an antihelmintic  drug which inhibits glucose 
uptake, oxidative phosphorylation and anaerobic metabolism .  Niclosamide has few side effects and is 
known to be well tolerated even when applied over a long period [19]. Reported a dverse effects of 
Niclosamide are mild and inf requent. This may include GI disturbances, lightheadedness, malaise, and 
pruritus. Alcohol may enhance the absorption of niclosamide , increasing the risk of side effects and 
therefore should be avoided when taking this drug.    
Pregnancy and breastfeeding a re not exclusion criteria.  The FDA categorizes medications based on 
safety for use during pregnancy. Five categories - A, B, C, D, and X, are used to classify the possible risks 
to an unborn baby [CONTACT_152561] a medication is taken during pregnancy.  
 
Niclosamide f alls into category B:  
• There are no well -done studies that have been done in humans with Niclosamide. But in animal 
studies, pregnant animals were given this medication, and the babies did not show any medical issues 
related to this medication.  
• Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during 
breastfeeding.  
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENE FITS  
 
Niclosamide  is an oral medication that has been used to treat tapeworm infestations since 1960[6]. It is 
on the World Health Organization (WHO) List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective 
medicines needed in a health system  [6]. In addition to its orig inally prescribed use, Niclosamide  has 
been repurposed for a variety of clinical applications.  Niclosamide  has demonstrated antiviral activity 
both in vitro and in vivo on a variety of single stranded RNA -based viral strains  [4, 5, 7 -13] and even 
SARS -CoV, a previous strain of coronavirus associated with the SARS outbreak in China in 2002[14]. Even 
more recently, Niclosamide  was shown to inhibit SARS -CoV-2, the strain responsible for the current 
COVID -19 pandemic  [3]. Its mechanism of action in this capaci ty is to increase the pH within acidic 
endosomes of host cells, thereby [CONTACT_519259] [4, 11, 15]. In addition to its 
antihelmintic and antiviral properties, Niclosamide  has also demonstrated anti -inflammatory activity 
[16, 17], and ha s shown promise for treating respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375]  [18-20] even functioning as a 
bronchodilator in an in vivo mouse model of asthma [21, 22]. Furthermore, that Niclosamide  has been 
utilized in a variety of human clinical trials to enhance chemotherapeutics i n cancer treatment [19, 23 -

immunocompromised cancer patients.   
 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENT IAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The primary goal is to maximize patient safety. To fulfill this goal, Tufts and the study team will take 
every measure to reduce patient risk of COVID -19-related complications, which includes the following:  
• Reduction of in -patient and outpatient face - to face visits to limit amount of exposure to 
patient and related populations  
• Use of a courier service to provide study materials  and no pi[INVESTIGATOR_519198]  
• Extensive patient screening prior to enrollment to ensure that all enrolled patients meet 
inclusi on/exclusion criteria; more specifically to avoid enrollment of COVID -[ADDRESS_673560] informat ion of the Study Team, and any adverse reactions will be reported as required 
by [CONTACT_760].

4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
Randomized double -blind placebo control (RDBPC) studies provide the stron gest possible evidence of 
causation.  Phase II trials are used to determine the efficacy and safety of an intervention in participants 
with the disease for which a new intervention is proposed.  Randomization in combination with blinding 
helps to avoid pos sible bias in the selection of participants, their assignment to an intervention or 
control, and the analysis of their response to the intervention.   
 
4.[ADDRESS_673564] oral dosage of Niclosamide prescribed for Hymenolepis nana tapeworm infestation (e.g. 
adults —maximum of 2 grams/day for seven days) is clinically efficacious in this antiviral capacity. Based 
on previous antiviral studies of Niclosamide  both in v itro and in vivo [5, 13, 14] , the average required 
dosage to achieve antiviral activity is 1 uM, which corresponds to ~0.327 µg/ml. In a recent clinical trial 
to test efficacy of Niclosamide  as an antimetastatic therapy [23, 24] , clinicians found that upon oral 
intake, Niclosamide  Cmax plasma level peaked to a median of 0.665 µg/ml ( ranging from 0.429 to 0.848 
µg/ml ), suggesting that traditional oral drug delivery should be sufficient t o inhibit SARS -CoV-2 
production.  Repeated dosing is commonly used when treating an infection where viruses may (at the 
time of ingestion) be at various stages of attachment, invasion, and replication.   
Importantly, human infections with SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_673565] demonstrated two  known reservoirs of the virus.  
Viremia tends to be relatively uncommon, with viral replication largely occurring in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_519202] [37, 38] . The few cases in which SAR -CoV-2 titers are detectable in plasma ha ve 
been reported in those patients already progressed to severe disease requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [39]. 
Plasma levels are limited both by [CONTACT_519267], but also by [CONTACT_454352].  In Bayer 
simulations Cmax levels reaching almost 1200 nmol/ l, or 1.2 uM is predicted.  There is 99% plasma 
protein binding.  Though free drug concentrations may not exceed the IC50 in plasma, we do not 
anticipate viral burden in the plasma to be a significant contributor  to disease or spread of virus.

subjects reported that upon a single oral dose of 2g carbonyl -14C-labeled Niclosamide , up to 25% of 14C-
activity was detected in urine while the remainder was eliminated in feces [31] suggesting that 
Niclosamide  may be preferentially sequestered in the GI tract. Other studies have also suggested a 
similar biodistribution of Niclosamide  in the colon [34]. Oral delivery of Niclosami de in mice infected with 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_519203], inhibited disease pathogenesis by [CONTACT_519268][INVESTIGATOR_519204] [34]. With increasing insights emerging into the critical role of GI involvement in COVID -[ADDRESS_673567].  In a transgenic mouse model of asthma, niclosamide treatment (13 
mg/kg/day) reduced mucus production, br onchoconstriction, and inflammation of airway tissues. 
Assuming the average human weighs approximately 62kg, our dosing strategy of 2g/day, is the 
equivalent of approximately 32mg/kg/day, which is significantly higher and likely to have similar effects. 
In addition, systemic delivery of niclosamide (20mg/kg) significantly enhanced efficacy of 
chemotherapeutic drugs in an in vivo mouse model of non -small cell lung cancer [40], further 
demonstrating that niclosamide can specifically target the lung in vivo .

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   14 Informed Consent will be obtained , all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are met .   
 
In addition to  niclosamide  or placebo treatments, all enrolled patients will be provided a home 
thermometer as well as a fingertip probe pulse oximeter, with the specific instructions to monitor both 
temperatu re at oxygen saturation at the time of daily oral administration of drug.   The relatively low 
reported percentage of error for the finger probe supports  that the finger probe is the modality of 
choice to measure intermittent oxygen saturation in the outpat ient setting.   
 
Oropharyngeal and fecal swabs will be collected at days 1 (baseline), 3, 7, 10, and 14 of the study. An 
additional fecal specimen will be collected at day 21. In the case of oropharyngeal samples, care will be 
taken to ensure that sampling methods are consistent for each individual patient across all included 
timepoints, to limit any bias due to potential differences in viral load.   
 
Oropharyngeal collection is  minimally invasive and can reliably be self -administered.  Recent research 
testing SARS -CoV-2 detection, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (saliva) samples from confirmed                    
SARS -CoV-2 found that oropharyngeal yielded greater detection sens itivity and consistency throughout 
the course of infection. Less variability in self -sample collection was also found. This research 
demonstrated that oropharyngeal samples are a viable and more sensitive alternative to 
nasopharyngeal swabs and can enable at-home self -administered sample collection for accurate SARS -
CoV-2 testing [41, 42 ].  
 
The collection of oropharyngeal samples will be directly observed by a Study Team member via the 
telehealth platform.  The participant will open the viral transport kit  and swab the back of the throat and 
tonsil area (avoiding mouth, teeth, and gums) and place to swab back into the vial.  For fecal specimen, 
the participant will swab feces from a plastic container (or wrap) placed on the toilet seat.  Printed 
instruction s will be provided to each participant with detail on how to collect both the oropharyngeal 
and fecal specimens.  These instructions will also be reviewed with the participant by a member of the 
Study Team.  
 
Once obtained, samples will be transported by [CONTACT_519272][INVESTIGATOR_519211] - certified lab to prevent unnecessary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519212] -quarantine status of enrolled patients.

their Smartphone by [CONTACT_519273] .  Scripted guidance will be provided to the study CRCs  to ensure that 
instructions provided to participants are consistent.  For example, included in the script, the study CRC 
will provide instruction in simple, easy to understand language such as, “ I am going to take a minute and 
walk you through signing up for the app so you are ready on your visit date.  “I’ve have actually gone 
ahead and scheduled the visit for you in the app ”.  The app is navy blue, has a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a doctor with a 
stethoscope and ligh ter blue heart”.    Once set up, a reminder of the upcoming appointment will be sent 
to the participant via email and text  message .   
 
Once the participant “checks - in” for their study visit , the CRC, investigator,  or Study Team member will 
receive a notice  that the participant is in the Waiting Room .  A family member or other support person 
of the participant ’s choice can be included in any/all visits via Facetime.  More than one study team 
member can also join the appointment as needed  or desired  with the “Add Person”  Facetime 
number/ address.  Once the study team enters the Waiting Room , a split screen clearly displays the 
patient, support person and the study team member(s).

8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
 
For Study procedures and evaluations to be done as part of the study to monitor safety and support the 
understanding of the study intervention’s safety  refer to  Section 1. 2, Schedule of Activities and Section 
8.1 Study Assessments.  
   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
Adverse event data will be summarized for all participants in the safety population. Site -reported serious 
adverse events and unexpected adverse drug reactions will be summarized as participant -based counts 
and percentages by [CONTACT_436810].  MedDRA system organ class and preferred term In addition, participant 
listings will be provided for serious, unexpected, and unanticipated adverse reactions. Any adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of study drug or death will also be listed for all p articipants.  
 
Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is defined as any unanticipated medical occurrence regardless to relationship of the investigative 
arm of the trial. An AE can be any unintended sign, lab abnormality, symptom, or disease associated 
with the trial. Any abnormality that presents during a medical test are to be defined as an AE if it 
produces clinical signs and/or symptoms, requires intervention, or deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_3786].  
 
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will  be utilized for AE reporting 
the following study - specific AEs: 
 Cough  
 Dyspnea  
 Hypoxia  
 Nausea  
 Vomiting  
 Abdominal pain  
 Pruritus  
 Loss of appetite

Selker PI  01022021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   22  Dizziness  
 Skin rash  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
An AE is considered serious if it results in any of the following:  
 results in death;  
 is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
 results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
 any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition  
 
Definition of Unexpected Adverse Reaction (UAE)  
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the  applicable product 
information (e.g. Product Informa tion/Summary of  Product Characteristics). This would include any SAE 
on health or safety, any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a drug; or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a drug that relates to the righ ts, safety, or welfare 
of subjects.  
 
8.3.1  CLASSIFICATION OF AN  ADVERSE E VENT . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_519278] V. 5.0  
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2 :  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
 Grade 3 :  Severe or medically significant but not immediately lif e-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y INTERVENTION  
A Study Team physician will oversee the evaluation of patient reported severity of AEs using the 
following categories:  
Relationship to Study Products  
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_501520]/her clinical judgment. The degree of 
certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
NIC for COVID  Version 7.0  
Protocol  00000605  
Selker PI  01022021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   23 Definitely:  
 The relationship of the AE and the drug or the study procedure can be 
established.  
 
Probably:  
 While a clear relationship to the drug or to the study procedure cannot be 
established, the AE is associated with an expected AE or there is no other 
medical condition or intervention, wh ich could explain the occurrence of such 
an event.  
 
Possibly:  
 There is no clear relationship between the AE and the drug or study procedure; 
however, one cannot conclude  that there is no relationship.  
 
Unrelated:  
 There is no relationship between the AE  and the drug or study procedure.  This 
may include but is not limited to the incident being an expected outcome of a 
previously existing or concurrent disease, concomitant medication or 
procedure the participant experienced.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
Study Team members who are  clinically  qualified  (e.g., a physician co - Investigator)  will be responsible 
for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study products. This information will be provided to the IRB, to the Study Sponsor, and 
to any relevant governmental agency with regulatory or public health authority.  
8.3.2  TIME PERIOD AND FREQ UENCY FOR EV ENT ASSESSMENT AND F OLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care . 
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the  criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while 
on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
 
8.3.3  ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
Adverse event data will be summarized for all participants in the safety population. Serious adverse 
events and unexpected adverse drug reactions will be summarized as participant -based counts and 
percentages by [CONTACT_436810] . In addition, participant listings will be provided for serious, unexpected, 
and unanticipated adverse reactions. Any adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug or 
death will also be listed for all participants.

8.3.7  REPORTING OF PREGNAN CY  
 
During the Informed Consent discussion, the MD study Investigator will ask women of childbearing 
potential if they are pregnant.  That yes/ no response will be recorded.  We will not exclude  women who 
are of childbearing years or pregnant.  We will collect pregnancy status information at the time of 
enrollment.  Niclosamide is a Category B (animal studies show no risks, but there are no controlled 
studies in pregnant women). Category B drugs include prenatal vitamins, acetaminophen and several 
other medications used routinely and safely during pregnancy.   
 
In addition to recording whether women of childbearing age are pregnant at the time of study 
enrollment, we will also record their breastfeeding status. For enrolled subjects who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding, we will include  follow up a specific query for any adverse effects on pregnancy and/or 
breastfeeding infant during the course of the study.  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PRO BLEMS  
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) : 
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed con sent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may h ave been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
NIC for COVID  Version 7.0

physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNA NTICIPATED PROBLEM R EPORTING  
 
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB).  The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or  outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
• UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 5 working days of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event.  
• A Study Team evaluation of an UP wil l be performed with a report of results of such evaluation 
will be provided to the reviewing IRB by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 5 working days.  
• All other Reportable New Information will be reported to the IRB as per the policy.  
 
8.4.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPA TED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS  
 
AEs, SAEs and U Ps will be reported to IRB as outlined in Sections 8.3.5, 8.3.6 and 8.4. 2 
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
 
The null hypothesis is that the proportion of participants with respi[INVESTIGATOR_519190] 3 is the 
same in both treatment groups. The alternative hypothesis is that they are different.  
  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
For the primary efficacy endpoint of respi[INVESTIGATOR_519220] 3 measured by [CONTACT_519279] 3, 50% of participants in the niclosamide  group who have a 
positive result on Day 1 (prior to dosing) will have a negative test results and 15% in the placebo group.    
With [ADDRESS_673583] 89% power to show a statistically s ignificant difference 
between groups at Day 3 using Fisher’s Exact test at the two -sided 0.05 significance level .  Assuming that 
40% of randomized participants have a positive respi[INVESTIGATOR_519221], 200 participants will be requi red 
to be randomized into the study.

 Safety Analysis Dataset: participants who took at least one dose of study intervention  
 Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset: subset of the participants in the full a nalysis (ITT) set who took at 
least 80% of study intervention and had no protocol violations that would affect the primary 
efficacy endpoint.  
 Other Datasets  that may be used for sensitivity analyses  
 
9.[ADDRESS_673585] deviation, minimum, and maximum, as well as the 95% confidence 
interval for the mean. For treatment comparisons, the difference between the two treatment arms will 
be summarized with the difference of the two means and 95% confidence interval for the difference of 
the means. These calculations will be done under the assumption that the data for the two arms are 
independent and approximately normal in distribution. If not otherwise specified, the conf idence 
interval for the difference of two means is calculated assuming unequal variance between the two 
groups. If asymptotic assumptions fail, nonparametric summary statistics (medians, 25th and 75th 
percentiles) may be displayed as an alternative. In add ition, more appropriate non -parametric tests will 
be considered if the assumptions for the parametric tests are violated. For the comparison of two 
independent samples, if the data are not normally distributed, Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be 
performed inst ead of the parametric t -test.  
 
For categorical variables, results within each arm will be summarized with participant counts, 
percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. The differences between the two treatment arms will be 
summarized with the difference in percentages and the asymptotic 95% confidence interval for the 
difference of two percentages.  
 
Survival analysis techniques will be used to analyze the time -to-event variables. Survival curves will be 
constructed using Kaplan -Meier estimates. Log -rank t est results will be computed for comparison of 
survival distributions. Summary tables for safety and efficacy endpoints will include event rates (Kaplan -
Meier estimates of event rates), relative risk, confidence interval for the relative risk, the differen ce in 
means/rates, the confidence interval for difference in means/rates, and the p -value.

10.1.6  SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
An appropriately credentialled Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) without association to the trial or 
conflicts of related to the study will monitor the data on a weekly basis and make recommendations to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_519227]:  
 Safety of the trial participants including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAE's), 
and unexpected problems  
 The Independent Safety Monitor will review and evaluate all AEs and SAEs in a blinded fashion,  
however, can be unb linded as needed.  
 The ISM will have access to unblinded SAE rates for participants randomized to niclosamide and 
placebo. Rates of non -serious AEs will also be compared between the two study groups.  
Subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). A greater than 3x 
incidence of treatment related SAEs in the niclosamide treatment group vs placebo will be added to the 
protocol as the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_519228]’s  research 
by [CONTACT_519295], safety, and welfare of subjects under the investigator’s care.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519229] e so in an ethical manner and in accordance with all 
federal, state, and local laws and regulations, institutional policies/procedures, the study protocol/plan, 
and the requirements of the IRB. Oversight is defined as management by [CONTACT_519296] a person or group, watchful care, superintendence, general supervision. Any person serving 
as a PI [INVESTIGATOR_519230]. To provide PI [INVESTIGATOR_519231], safety, and welfare of research 
subjects is protected the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318], at a minimum, confirm:  
 Any individual to whom a task is delegated is qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to 
perform the task.  
 There is adequate training  for all staff participating in the conduct of the study  
  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519232]  
 All research staff adhere to th e research plan (i.e., inclusion/exclusion criteria, safety 
assessments, safety monitoring and reporting of unanticipated problems).

 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519233]. A sub - Investigator can cover for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_519234].  
 A Delegation of Authority Log will be completed prior to opening to accrual. T his log will be 
maintained accurately during the life of the study.  
 A Training Log will be completed  prior to opening to accrual. This log will be maintained 
accurately during the life of the study.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519235] -off on all study -related documents (i.e., 
eligibility verification) prior to subjects beginning study treatment per protocol  to ensure the 
safety of the study participants  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519236], sign-off on all 
AEs and SAEs.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519237]. 
At a minimum, this is intended to be through a combination of electronic, audio, and face to 
face interactions. Details and specifics of th ese interactions will be  established by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_519238].  
 Communication regarding SAEs will be documented in real -time. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_125234], the 
delegated physician Investigator  should be notified.  
 Regular mee tings with the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_519239], including AEs and treatment, will 
be established  to ensure adequate oversight. This is in addition to the immediate availability of 
the PI, or delegated physician Investigator , to address SAE, protocol interpretation , safety 
monitoring  or other urgent clinical needs.  Involvement of the treating sub -investigator is 
recommended but not required.  
 Timely and accurate documentation of oversight is required and will be  provided by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_519240]15 72. The nature of oversight documentation is through written and 
electronic means.  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_519241]-off within 24 hours of notification of the event.  
 All non-urgent regu latory documents including IRB submission/revisions, AE attribution 
assignments, AE grading will be completed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_519242] 48 hours . 
 Additional study documents including but not limited to research notes, email correspondences , 
and study logs are to be reviewed at least on a weekly basis  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_519243].

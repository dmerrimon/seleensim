Title:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, 
Multi -Center Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of 
Lumateperone Monotherapy in the Treatment of Patients with 
Major Depressive Epi[INVESTIGATOR_211369] I or 
Bipolar  II Disorder (Bipolar Depression)  or Major Depressive 
Disorder  
Study Design : This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
lumateperone monotherapy in the treatment of patients with 
major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (MDEs) associated with Bipolar  I or 
Bipolar  II Disorder  (Bipolar  Depression ) or major depressive 
disorder (MDD) who also meet the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorder, 5th Edition (DSM -5) criteria for 
mixed -features . The study consists of a Screening Period, a 
Double -blind Treatment Period, and a Safety Follow-up Period.  
Screening Period (2 Weeks)  
Potential patients will be evaluated during a Screening Period 
lasting up to 2 weeks . 
After obtaining written informed consent, diagnostic interviews 
and physical examinations will be conducted, vital signs and 
ECGs will be assessed, and blood samples for laboratory 
assessments will be collected. Patients considered potentially 
eligible for participation will be required to discontinue their 
current antidepressant treatment and/or other psychotropic 
drugs.  
At Baseline  (Visit 2), patients who continue to meet all eligibility 
criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 
2 treatment arms (lumateperone 42 mg  or placebo) for a 
6-week, double -blind treatment period.  
Double -blind Treatment Period (6 We eks) 
Patients will take their first dose of study drug  the evening of 
their randomization visit. A single dose will be taken each day in 
the evening for the duration of the on -treatment period. 
Following randomization, patients will attend clinic visits on 
Days  8, 15, 22, 29, 36 , and 43. 
The Double -blind T reatment Period will be a total of 6 weeks.  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  2 ITI-007-403 Protocol  27 Jan 2023  Safety Follow -up Period (2 Weeks)  
A return to the clinic for a safety follow -up visit will occur at 
Week  8, approximately [ADDRESS_253227] dose of study 
drug. Patients who withdraw prematurely should  be seen for an 
early termination visit and will be asked to return to the clinic for 
a safety follow -up visit approximately 2 weeks after Visit 8/Early  
Termination (ET) . 
Objectives:  Primary  Objective : 
The primary objective of this study is to confirm the efficacy of 
lumateperone  42 mg  administered orally once daily compared 
with that of placebo as measured by [CONTACT_211394]  43 in  the Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
(MADRS) total score in patients with bipolar  depression  with 
mixed features  or MDD  with mixed features . 
 Secondary Objectives  
 Key Secondary  Objective : 
The key secondary objective of this study is to confirm the 
efficacy of lumateperone 42 mg administered orally once daily 
compared with that of placebo as measured by [CONTACT_211395] 43 in Clinical Global Impression Scale –
Severity (CGI -S) score in patients with bipolar depression  with 
mixed features or MDD with mixed features . 
 Safety Objective:  
The safety objective of this study is to determine the safety and 
tolerability of lumateperone administered orally once daily  
compared  with that of placebo in patients with bipolar 
depression or MDD as assessed by [CONTACT_20721] (AEs) ; 
clinical laboratory results ; vital sign measures ; 
electrocardiogram (ECG) results ; suicidality as assessed by [CONTACT_65921] -Suicid e Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) ; mani c 
symptoms  as assessed by [CONTACT_211396] 
(YMRS ); and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as assessed by 
[CONTACT_211397] (AIMS), Barnes 
Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and Simpson Angus Scale 
(SAS) scales . 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  3 ITI-007-403 Protocol  27 Jan 2023  Population:  Male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years, 
inclusive, with a diagnosis of Bipolar  I or Bipolar  II Disorder  with 
mixed features or major depressive disorder (MDD)  with mixed 
features  who are experiencing a  major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
(MDE ) and who meet the following criteria  may be eligible for 
participation in the study : 
• The start of the current  MDE is at least 2 weeks but no more 
than 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1);  
• The patient has at least moderate severity of illness as 
measured by  [CONTACT_132633] ≥ 24 and CGI -S score ≥ 4 
at Screening (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2);  
• The patient has sufficient history and/or independent report 
verifying that the current MDE is causing clinically significant 
distress or impairment in social, occup ational, or other 
important areas of functioning;  
• The patient has a YMRS total score between 4 and  16, 
inclusive , at Screening (Visit  1) and Baseline (Visit 2).  
Patients will be enrolled in multiple countries globally.  
Phase:  3 
Number of Sites:  Up to 60 sites, approximately  
Description of 
Intervention:  Patients will be randomized to receive either lumateperone 
42 mg or placebo. Patients will self -administer doses orally, 
once daily, each evening  at home  for the duration of the Double -
blind Treatment Period. Study drug  will be provided in blister 
cards containing capsules , and patients will be instructed to take 
1 capsule per dose.  
Study  Duration:  For each patient completing the study, the study will last up to 
approximately 10 weeks (9 visits), including a Screening  Period , 
a Double -blind T reatment Period , and a Safety Follow -up 
Period . 
Statistical 
Methods:  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to 
Day 43 in MADRS total score.  
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed 
using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with the change from baseline in the MADRS total score at each 
pre-specified postbaseline time point as the response variable ; 
treatment group , visit, site (or pooled site), the stratification 
factor at screening (Bipolar  Disorder or MDD diagnosis ), and 
treatment group -by-visit interaction as factors ; and the baseline 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  [ADDRESS_253228] be performed based on the 
combined patient population of Bipolar Disorder  with mixed 
features and of MDD  with mixed features. If th e key secondary 
analysis is statistically significant  at 0.05 level , then by [CONTACT_2329] a 
similar MMRM model , the key secondary efficacy analyses will 
be performed separately for the subpopulation of Bipolar 
Disorder  with mixed featur es and for the subpopulation of MDD  
with mixed features .  
Multiple comparisons for the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be addressed using a fixed -sequence 
(hierarchical) gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_211372] . The key secondary efficacy endpoint will be tested  
and its 2-sided p -value compared with 0.05 level for statistical 
significance  only if the comparison for the primary efficacy 
endpoint is significant for the combined and two separate 
subpopulation s at 2-sided α =  0.05 overall level.  Otherwise, the 
p-value for the key secondary efficacy endpoint will be reported 
as nominal.  
The efficacy conclusion will be based on the analyses using the 
modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set . The mITT Analysis  
Set is defined as all randomized patients enrolled after the 
implementation of A mendment 2.0 (dated 02 Nov  2020)  who 
received at least [ADDRESS_253229] -baseline assessment of MADRS total score .  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  5 ITI-007-403 Protocol  27 Jan 2023  Descriptive analyses of the efficacy endpoints will be performed 
for patients enrolled before the implementation of Amendment 
2.0 (dated 02 Nov 2020) .  
Safety Analyses  
Safety data such as reported and observed AEs and SAEs, 
clinical laboratory results, vit al signs, physical and neurological 
examination findings, ECGs, YMRS , EPS as measured by 
[CONTACT_143486], BARS , and SAS, and C-SSRS, will be summarized 
descriptively  by [CONTACT_6982] . When appropriate, 
out-of-range values will be flagged in data listings and tabulated. 
Shift tables will be prepared for pre -specified safety measures . 
The safety analysis  will be performed using  the Safety Analysis 
Set, defined as all randomized patients who received at least 1 
dose of study drug .  
A statistical analysis plan  (SAP) will be finalized prior to 
unblinding patients’ treatment assignments.  
Sample Si ze: The assumed effect size (treatment -group difference relative to 
pooled standard deviation ) of 0.[ADDRESS_253230] deviation  of 9 for the primary efficacy parameter, 
change from baseline to Day 43 in MADRS total score. A sample 
size of 350 patients (175 per treatment group) enrolled after the 
implementation of Amendment 2.0 (dated 02 Nov  2020) will be 
needed to provide 90% power for primary analysis for the 
combined population of Bipolar Disorder with mixed features 
and MDD with mixed features based on a  mixed -effect model 
for repeated measures ( MMRM ) using simulation method 
(Lu, 2012). The simulation assume s a correlation of 0.7 between 
the repeated measures and a dropout rate of 10% based on 
historical data .  
The sample size and statistical power for the primary  analys es 
in the subpopulations are presented in Section 9.1. 
The study randomized approximately 100 patients under the 
original protocol before the implementation of Amendment 2.0 
(dated 02 Nov  2020); th erefore, the total enrollment for the study 
will be approximately 450 patients .

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background Information  
Major depressive disorder  (MDD) is a serious psychiatric disorder characterized by [CONTACT_211398][INVESTIGATOR_1841] (MDE) without a history of manic, 
mixed, or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_211373]; 
however, the average age of onse t is in the mid -20s. The lifetime risk for MDD is 
estimated at 5% to 12% for men and 10% to 25% for women. MDD has a high mortality 
rate and up to 15% of patients with severe major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_143447]. In 
addition, individuals with MDD have high medical morbidity and are often plagued with 
more pain and physical illness than the general population.  
Bipolar Disorder is a serious psychiatric disorder that may also result in major depressive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_211374] . Bipolar I 
Disorder is defined by [CONTACT_211399] a with or without mi xed features whereas 
Bipolar II Disorder is defined by [CONTACT_211400], but both are often associated 
with MDEs. Bipolar Disorder affects approximately 5.7 million adult Americans a year, or 
about 2.6% of the U.S. population age [ADDRESS_253231] longer, re cur more often, and are associated with worse 
prognosis than manic/hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Bipolar Depression, the predominant 
presentation of Bipolar Disorder, remains a significantly underserved medical need, with 
only a few approved treatment options availa ble. 
In both MDD and Bipolar Disorder, MDEs may include some symptoms of hypomania or 
mania that do not meet the criteria for a manic or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The recognition of 
this presentation has been noted in the DSM -5 (2013) as the specifier of “mixed f eatures.” 
Mixed features associated with MDD ha ve been noted to be a risk factor for the 
development of Bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder, highlighting the clinical utility of this 
specifier. Additionally, these “subsyndromic hypomanic” patients with either  MDD or 
Bipolar Disorder may suffer from greater symptom severity, increased recurrence of mood 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], higher comorbidity, and increased risk of suicidality. These poorer outcomes 
emphasize the need for effective treatments in this population . 
Lumateperone (trade name [CONTACT_143508]®) was approved by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) on December 20, 2019 , under NDA 209500 for the treatment of 
schizophrenia in adults. Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , Inc.  (ITI, the Sponsor ) is exploring the 
utility of lumateperone ( ITI-007) for the treatment of MDEs with mixed features associated 
with Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorder (bipolar depression) and MDD . 
Lumateperone  is a novel small molecule therapeutic agent designed specifically to 
combine  serotonergic, dopaminergic , and glutamatergic modulation  in a dose -dependent 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  10 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 manner . Lumateperone  is a  potent serotonin 5 -HT2A receptor antagonis t with 
mesolimbic/mesocortical selective modulation of phosphoprotein pathways downstream 
of dopamine receptor s, serotonin reuptake inhibition , and indirect glutamatergic  
modulation  (Snyder et al , 2015 ). As a dopamine receptor protein phosphorylation 
modulator, lumateperone  has dual properties, acting as post -synaptic anta gonist and as 
a pre -synaptic partial agonist at dopamine 2 (D 2) receptors in vivo, with 
mesolimbic/mesocortical selectivity. Lumateperone  also increas es the phosphorylation of 
the NR2B, or GluN2B, subunit of N -methyl -D-aspartate channels in extrastriatal 
dopamine -rich brain regions (e g, nucleus accumbens)  and indirectly modulates 
glutamatergic (NM DA and AMPA) activity downstream from dopamine 1 receptor 
activation.  
Evidence supports the use of D 2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of Bipolar  Disorder , 
including bipolar  depression  (Young et al, 2013 ; Loebel et al , 2014a ; 2014b ), as both 
monotherapy and adjunctive therapy to mood stabilizers. In addition, studies have also 
shown the potential for D 2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of MDEs with mixed 
features in MDD ( Suppes et al , 2016 ; Swann et al , 2017 ) as well as mixed features in 
Bipolar Depression ( McIntyre et al , 2015 ; McIntyre et al , 2020 ). The pharmacologic profile 
of lumateperone includes both the post -synaptic D [ADDRESS_253232] antidepressant 
efficacy with fewer side effects than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( Meltzer et al , 
1989 ). Lumateperone’s  indirect glutamatergic modulation in combination with serotonin 
reuptake inhibition predicts rapid -acting antidepressant response.  Importantly, 
lumateperone lacks potent off -target interactions that have been associated with side 
effects of other antipsychotic drugs approved for the treatment of bipolar  depression . For 
example, lumateperone shows relatively weak affinity for [ADDRESS_253233] favorable body weight 
and metabolic profile responses to the extent that these receptors mediate such effects. 
Additional details on the pharmacologic profile of lumateperone are provided  in the  
Investiga tor’s Brochure . 
Nonclinical data also suggest that lumateperone may have the potential to treat 
depression ( Snyder et al , 2015 ). Antidepressant -like activity of lumateperone  was 
measured using the social defeat (re sident -intruder) mouse model. Mice exposed to 
repeated social defeat conditions display a reduced amount of time in contact [CONTACT_211401] -aggressive mice than normal controls. Such defeat behavior is reversed 
by [CONTACT_40328] (but not acute) treatment with  clinically effective antidepressant drugs. In this 
model, lumateperone 1 mg/kg, administered once daily intraperitoneally for 28 days, 
reversed the defeat behavior, consistent with antidepressant efficacy. Brain -receptor 
target engagement was confirmed in  healthy male volunteers in Study ITI-007-003, the 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  11 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 positron emission tomography (PET) Phase 1 clinical trial ( Davis et al , 2015 ). PET was 
used to determine dopamine D 2 receptor, serotonin transporter (SERT), and serotonin 
5-HT2A receptor occupancy in the brain at various times following single dose oral 
lumateperone  administration. Lumateperone  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_143448], showed long -
lasting and dose -related occupancy , and was generally safe and well -tolerated. Cortical 
5-HT2A receptors were shown to be fully occupi[CONTACT_38696] 10 mg dose  (>85% occupancy). 
A dose of lumateperone 40 mg achieved up to 39% striatal D 2 occupancy (average of 
29%) and up to 31% striatal SERT oc cupancy (average of 22%). Together, these data 
confirm a central mechanism for lumateperone at dopaminergic and serotonergic brain 
targets. An additional PET study in patients with schizophrenia ( Study ITI-007-008) 
demonstrated an average of approximately 40% striatal D [ADDRESS_253234] antipsychotic 
drugs.  
Clinical data from 3 well-controlled studies in patient s with schizophrenia ( Studies 
ITI-007-005, ITI -007-301, and ITI -007-302) are consistent with respect to the 
pharmacological profile and prediction for antidepressant effects with favorable safety and 
tolerability. In addition to improving psychotic symptoms, lumateperone also improved 
symptoms of depression in  patients with schizophrenia and comorbid depression at 
baseline . Safety data from these  studies  and other trials with lumateperone , which has 
been  administered to more than 1500 individuals , show lumateperone to be  well tolerated 
across a dose range from 0.7 to 98  mg, administered once daily for up to 42 days  with a 
safety profile similar to placebo . 
In previously conducted  bipolar depression studies (Stud ies ITI -007-401, ITI-007-404, 
and ITI -007-402) lumateperone was well -tolerated  with a favorable safety profile. Studies 
ITI-007-401 and ITI -007-404 were randomized, double -blind, fixed -dose, placebo -
controlled, outpatient clinical trials designed to evaluate lumateperone as monotherapy in 
patients with major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_211375] I or II Disorder.  
Study ITI -007-402 was a randomized, double -blind, fixed -dose, placebo -controlled, 
outpatient clinical trial designed to evaluate lumateperone as adjunctive to lithium or 
valproate in patients with major depressi ve epi[INVESTIGATOR_211376] I or II 
Disorder.  
In Study ITI -007-404, which was conducted globally, once -daily lumateperone 42 mg met 
the primary endpoint with statistically significant improvement over placebo at Week 6 
(study  endpoint) , as measured by [CONTACT_211402]. 
Lumateperone [ADDRESS_253235] hoc analysis of patients with 4  ≤ YMRS  ≤ [ADDRESS_253236] acebo at Week 6 , as measured by [CONTACT_211403] -BP-S total score.  
In Study ITI -007-402, which was conducted globally, once -daily lumateperone 42 mg 
adjunctive to lithium or valproate met the primary endpoint with statistically significant 
improvement over placebo at Week 6 (study endpoint) , as measured by [CONTACT_211404]. Lumateperone 42 mg also met the key secondary 
endpoint of statistically significant improvement on the CGI -BP-S depression subscale.  
In Study ITI -007-401, which was conducted solely in the [LOCATION_002], neither 
lumateperone dose (28 mg or 42 mg) met the primary endpoint of statistical separation 
from placebo as measured by [CONTACT_143473]. There was a 
high pla cebo response in this trial.  
The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of lumateperone 42 mg administered 
orally once daily compared with that of placebo as measured by [CONTACT_211405] 43 in the MADRS total score in patients wit h bipolar depression with 
mixed features or MDD with mixed features . 
2.2 Rationale  
The screening phase permits evaluation of diagnosis  of Bipolar  I or Bipolar II Disorder  
with mixed features or MDD with mixed features . Laboratory and ECG assessments 
enable con firmation of eligibility for inclusion into the study. Unless an extension of 
screening is approved  by [CONTACT_211406] , the screening phase 
will be no longer than 2 weeks (14 days) . 
At Baseline  (Visit 2), patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment 
groups (lumateperone 42 mg  or placebo) and will receive treatment for up to 6  weeks. In 
order to ensure patient safety, a mandatory  follow -up visit will be performed approximately 
2 weeks  after Visit 8/  Early Termination ( ET). Any ongoing AEs at the follow -up visit must 
be followed until resolution, until the AE stabilizes, until it is determined to be non -clinically 
significant, or until the patient is lost to follow -up. 
Lumateperone 42  mg was selected to  evaluate the efficacy seen with this dose in bipolar 
depression stud ies ITI-007-404 and ITI -007-402. This dose  deliver s full occupancy of the 
cortical 5 -HT2A receptors (>85% occupancy)  with modest striatal D 2 receptor occupancy 
and SERT occupancy. Data from human PE T brain receptor occupancy studies  with 
lumateperone indicate that a dose as low as  10 mg is associated with >85% occupancy 
of cortical 5 -HT2A receptors,  while the 42-mg dose demonstrates approximat ely 4 0% 
striatal D 2 receptor occupancy . SERT occupancy  has been demonstrated to be 
comparable to D 2 receptor occupancy . Moreover, in patients with schizophrenia and 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  13 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 bipolar depression, once -daily oral administration of lumateperone 42  mg has been well 
tolerated with no dose titration needed and with a safety profile similar to placebo with up 
to 6 weeks’  treatment duration.  There is evidence that MDD patients with mixed features 
respond to similar doses of D2 receptor antagonists as bipolar depression patie nts with 
mixed features ( Suppes et al , 2016 ; Swann et al , 2017 ). Therefore, a fixed -dose design 
will be employed in this study with once daily oral administration of lumateperone 42  mg 
(or placebo).  
A placebo control group is needed to establish the efficacy of a new compound.

depression  or MDD who meet DSM -5 criteria for mixed features . 
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Patients  will be monitored carefully for their mental health status and general health. 
Symptoms of bipolar  depression  may or may not improve during participation in this study ; 
approximately half of the patients in th is study will receive placebo . However, the 
information obtained  from this study may help to treat people with bipolar  depression  in 
the future . More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks 
and reasonably expected AEs is provided  in the lumateperone  Invest igator’s Brochure .

 Screening Period (2 Weeks)  
Potential patients will be evaluated during a Screening Period lasting up to 2 weeks  unless 
an extension of the S creening Period is approved by [CONTACT_211409] .  
After obtaining written informed consent, diagnostic interviews and physical examinations 
will be conducted, vital signs and ECGs will be assessed, and blood samples will be 
collected for laboratory assessments. Patients considered potentially eligible for 
participation will be required to discontinue their current antidepressant treatment and/or 
other psychotropic drugs.  
At Baseline  (Visit 2), patients who continue to  meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized  
to 1 of the 2 treatment arms (lumateperone 42  mg or matching placebo) for a 6 -week, 
double -blind treatment period.  
Double -blind Treatment Period (6 Weeks)  
Patients will take their first dose of study drug  on the evening of Baseline  (Visit 2, Day 1). 
A single dose will be taken each day in the evening , with or without food,  for the duration 
of the 6-week Double -blind Treatment Period.  
Following randomization, patients will attend outpatient study visits  on Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 
36, and 43.  
With approval  from the Sponsor or Sponsor’s representative , sites will be permitted to 
conduct remote visits i f the patient is unable to travel to the site for an in -person visit or if 
the site is unable to schedule an in-person visit.  However, all Screening and Baseline 
(Visit 2) assessments must be performed in person.  
A patient will be defined as a treatment completer if the patient completed the double -
blind treatment period (all scheduled visits up to and including Visit 8).  
Safety Follow -up Period (2 Weeks)  
All patients should return to the clinic for the Safety Follow -up Visit approximately 2 weeks 
after Visit 8/ ET.

 5.4 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
At Baseline /Visit 2, patients who continue to me et all eligibility criteria will be randomly 
assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment arms  (lumateperone 42  mg or matching placebo)  for a 
6-week Double -blind Treatment Period . 
5.4.1  Randomization Procedures  
An interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) 
(English only) will be used to administer the randomization schedule. Unblinded 
biostatistics personnel not participating in the conduct of the study will generate a 
permuted block randomization schedule using SAS software Version  9.4 or newer  for 
IVRS/IWRS, which will link sequential patient randomization numbers to treatment codes. 
In the event that the blind needs to be broken because of a medical emergency, the 
Investigator may unblind an individual patient ’s treatment allocation (Section  5.4.3 ). 
Patients will be stratified based on their Bipolar Disorder or MDD diagnosis. Also, patients  
with Bipolar Disorder  will be further stratified by [CONTACT_211411]  I or Bipolar  II diagnos is. 
Each patient will be assigned a randomization number at the time of randomization, which 
will be separate from the patient identification number. Once a randomization number has 
been allocated to a patient, it may not be assigned to another patient.  
The IVRS/IWRS will send visit notifications to the study site personnel confirming that 
patient data were entered. The IVRS/IWRS notifications should be filed securely at the 
study site.  
5.4.2   Masking Procedures  
The study will be performed in a double -blind manner. All study drug  will be supplied in 
identical treatment cards and packaging, and will be similar in color, smell, taste, and 
appearance, thereby [CONTACT_211412] -blind conditions.  
5.4.3  Breaking the Blind  
A pat ient’s treatment assignment will not be broken until after the end of the study unless 
medical treatment of the patient depends on knowing the study drug  the patient received. 
In the event that the blind needs to be broken because of a medical emergency, t he 
Investigator may unblind an individual patient ’s treatment allocation. As soon as possible, 
the Investi gator should contact [CONTACT_22951] M onitor to discuss the medical emergency 
and the reason for revealing the actual treatment received by [CONTACT_90323]. The treatment 
assignment will be unblinded through IVRS/IWRS. Reasons for treatment unblinding must 
be clearly explained. The date on which the code was broken together with the identity of 
the person responsible must also be documented.  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  [ADDRESS_253251] been resolved.  
5.5 Discontinuation  of Patients  
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICF ceases 
participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, before the completion of all study 
visits and procedures.  Patients can be prematurely discontinued from the study after  
careful consideration for one of the following reasons:  
• Death  
• AE or SAE  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Lost to follow -up  
• Pregnancy  
• Physician decision  
• Protocol violation  
• Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_211413] : If a patient  discontinues due to withdrawal of consent and either a concurrent AE 
was reported or concurrent lack of efficacy was documented, the study site should query 
and confirm the primary reason for discontinuation and record the primary reason for 
discontinuati on on the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
All patients who prematurely discontinue from the study regardless of cause should be

 8.3.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug -related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not it is 
considered related to the medicinal product (ICH -E2A; 21 CFR 312.32[a]).  
NOTE:  Medical procedures scheduled prior to obtaining informed consent but occurring 
during the s tudy should not be captured as AEs but the medical reason for the procedure 
should be listed in the medical history if related to a pre -existing condition.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
Note : The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the patient is at risk of 
death at the time of the event.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211384];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on appropriate medi cal judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emerg ency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of study medication dependency or drug abuse.  
Emergency room visits that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211385].  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  40 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 Pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (eg, elective procedures for pre -existing conditions that did 
not worsen, such as cosmetic surgery and hysterectomy) are excluded from SAE 
reporting.  
Expectedness of SAEs  
The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for determining whether an SAE is expected 
or unexpected. An SAE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is not consistent with the risk information p reviously described for the 
intervention as documented in the  Investigator’s Brochure . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classification of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_253264] dose of study drug  administration is 
considered to be “unrelated. ” 
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug  and the AE.  
Table 8-1 presents the AE causality categories, one of which  should be selected based 
on medical judgment  and all contributing factors.  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  41 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 Table 8-1: Adverse Event Causality Categories  
Category  Definition  
Definitely related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals cannot  explain. The response to withdrawal of the 
treatment (dechallenge1) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory 
rechallenge2 procedure if necessary.  
Probably related  A clinica l event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawa l (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is 
not required to fulfill this definition.  
Possibly related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_8235]. 
Information on treatment withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely to be 
related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanations.  
Unrelated  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration. May have negative dechallenge and 
rechal lenge information. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], explained by [CONTACT_211417] (eg, 
concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals).  
1 Dechallenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE is discontinued. If the symptoms of the AE 
disappear parti ally or completely, within a reasonable time from drug discontinuation, this is termed a 
positive dechallenge. If the symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_211386], this is termed a negative 
dechallenge. Note that there are exceptions when an AE does no t disappear upon discontinuation of the 
drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists (e g, bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, tardive 
dyskinesia).  
[ADDRESS_253265] is readministered 
to that patient. If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a positive rechallenge. If the AE does not 
recur, this is termed a negative rechallenge.  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  42 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 [IP_ADDRESS].2  Severity  
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by [CONTACT_211418] a 
severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. Severity,  
which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from 
seriousness,  which implies a patient outcome or AE -required treatment measure 
associated with a threat to life or functionality ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). Severity will be assessed 
according to the following scale  (Table 8-2): 
Table 8-2: Adverse Event Severity Categories   
Category  Definition  
Mild A type of adverse event that is usually transient and may require only 
minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  A type of adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily 
living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of 
harm to the research  
Severe  A type of adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily l iving, or 
significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic 
intervention . 
Any change in intensity of signs and symptoms will be captured by [CONTACT_44745] a new AE 
with the amended intensity grade and the date of the change  in intensi ty. If changes in 
AE intensity occur more than once a day, the maximum intensity of the AE should be 
recorded for that day.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time Period and Frequency of AE Assessment and Follow -up 
The Investigator will report all AEs and SAEs from the time informed consen t was 
obtained until [ADDRESS_253266] known dose of 
study drug (if the final visit does not occur).  
All AEs must be followed to satisfactory resolution, until the Investigator deems the event 
to be chronic or  not clinically significant, or until the patient is considered to be clinically 
stable.  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  43 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_253267] be recorded 
on the appropriate AE  reporting page of the patient ’s eCRF whether or not they are 
considered causally related to study medication. For every AE, the Investigator must:  
• Provide an assessment of the seriousness of the event (ie, is it an SAE?), as well 
as the severity and casua l relationship. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for the definition of 
SAEs and Section [IP_ADDRESS].2  for SAE reporting procedures.  
• Docume nt all actions taken with regard to study medication  
• Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE  
Any AEs that are ongoing at the time of the final protocol -defined study visit will be 
followed until the condition returns to pre -study status, has r esolved or stabilized, or can 
be explained as being unrelated to study medication.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_253268] be notified immediately regarding any SAE that 
occurs after informed consent is obtained . 
For the initial SAE report, the Investigator will complete , sign, and date  a Serious Adverse 
Event Form and submit via fax or email within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event . 
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information:  
• Study number  
• Patient number  
• Gender  
• Date of birth  
• Name [CONTACT_211438]  
• Details of SAE  
• Criterion for classification as “serious”  
• Study drug code, or name [CONTACT_211439], and treatment start date and stop date, if 
applicable  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  44 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 • Date of SAE onset  
• Causality assessment (if sufficient information is available to make this classification)  
The Sponsor will request clarification of omitted or discrepa nt information from the initial 
notification. The Investigator or an authorized delegate is responsible for providing the 
requested information to the sponsor within 24 hours of the Sponsor’s request.  
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed later with det ailed descriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (e g, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, 
autopsy reports), with the study patient’s personal identifiers removed. All relevant 
information obtained by [CONTACT_211419] h review of these documents will be 
recorded and provided to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_253269] research organization (CRO) on behalf of the Sponsor before study initiation.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_253270] be followed up to determine outcome (including 
spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) 
and status of mother and child, even if the patient was discontinued from the st udy. 
Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons should not be 
reported as an AE or SAE.  If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg,  spontaneous 
miscarriage or  if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_143460]), a separate SAE form  must 
be filed as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2  with the appropriate serious criterion (eg, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated in addition to the  Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
8.3.3  ECG Assessments  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed during the Double -blind  Treatment Period at the visits 
specified in the Schedule of Evaluations ( Section 1). ECGs will be performed and 
electronically transmitted to a central ECG laboratory for analysis according to the 
instructions provided by [CONTACT_81131]. Measurements (in msec) will be 
recorded for the following parameters: PR  interval, QRS duration, and uncorrected QT 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  45 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 interval; QTcB (Bazett corrected QT  interv al) and QTcF (Fridericia corrected QT interval) 
will be calculated.  
The overall interpretation and determination of the clinical significance of ECG findings 
using the interpretation from the central ECG laboratory will be the responsibility of the 
Investi gator and will be recorded in the patient’s eCRF. For eligibility criteria, the values 
reported on the central ECG interpretation report, not the values that are printed on the 
tracing itself, are used.  
8.3.4  Vital Sign Assessments  
Vital signs (pulse rate, systo lic and diastolic blood pressure [BP], body temperature, body 
weight , and waist circumference ) will be assessed at every visit. Height will be assessed 
at Screening/ Visit 1 only ; BMI will be c alculated at Screening/Visit 1  and Visit 8/ET. 
BP and radial pul se rate will be measured twice: once in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_253271] 2 minutes to allow the BP to equilibrate in the standing state.  
BP may  be measured manually or by [CONTACT_211420], but radial pulse rate should only be 
measured manually and for a sufficient time to acquire an accurate measurement.  
Patients  should be instructed not to wear clothing with tight sleeves when they come for 
clinic visits . Additionally, patients  should be kept as calm and undisturbed as possible 
while BP and pulse rate measurements are taken (eg, there should be no talking while 
the BP is being measured). The same arm and BP cuff (appropriate to the arm 
circumference) shou ld be used for all BP measurements.  
Whenever possible, the patient ’s weight should be measured at the same time of day; the 
patient  should wear his/her usual indoor clothing but take off his/her jacket and shoes. 
For each patient, body weight should be det ermined using the same equipment during 
the study after ensuring its proper calibration . 
8.3.5  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected during the study  as 
detailed in the Schedule of Evaluations ( Table 1-1). During screening, the 
Investigator/sub -Investigator should assess the clinical significance of any values that are 
outside the reference ran ges provided by [CONTACT_2237]; patients  with 
abnormalities judged to be clinically significant will be excluded from the study. Laboratory 
results should be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]/sub -investigator throughout the study . 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  [ADDRESS_253272] overnight (≥ 10  hours ) before arriving at the study site for

cell count with indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration); reticulocytes; white blood cell count and 
differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, mon ocytes, eosinophils, and basophils) reported 
as percent (%) and absolute values; and platelet count.  
Clinical chemistry:  albumin; alkaline phosphatase; blood urea nitrogen; gamma -
glutamyl transferase; calcium; creatinine; glucose; insulin; cholesterol (hig h-density 
lipoprotein [HDL] and low -density lipoprotein [LDL] [calculated] and LDL will be reported, 
and LDL will be reflexed if a patient ’s triglycerides are >400  mg/dL ); triglycerides; 
phosphate; potassium; prolactin; ALT; AST; lactate dehydrogenase; sod ium; chloride; 
bilirubin (total, direct); total protein; uric acid; creatine phosphokinase; and TSH (reflex  
free T3 and free T4 at Screening /Visit 1 and at Visit 8/ET  only). 
Urinalysis:  macroscopic (pH, specific gravity, glucose, protein, ketones, nitrates, blood) 
and microscopic (red blood cells/high -power field, white blood cells/high -power field, 
casts, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], crystals, granulation).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatitis Screening  
Blood samples will b e collected at screening from all patients in order to perform 
hepatitis  B surface antigen , hepatitis B core antibody IgM , and hepatitis C antibody 
(immunoglobulin G) testing. Test results will be sent to the study site and must be 
reviewed before Baseline  (Visit 2, Day 1). Any patient who tests positive for hepatitis B  
surface antigen and/or hepatitis B core antibody IgM  or positive hepatitis C antibody with 
a positive confirmatory hepatitis C RNA result will be excluded from participating in the 
study. Details regarding sample collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_211388].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine Drug and Alcohol Screening  
Urine drug (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids [THC], cocaine 
metabolites, methadone, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, propoxyphene) and alcohol tests will be 
performed. Any patient who tests positive for  alcohol or  any drug, excluding prescription 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and cannabinoids, at scr eening will be excluded 
from participating in the study.  Positive drug screen results may undergo confirmative 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  47 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 testing.  Repeat testing is prohibited for positive alcohol, cocaine, phencyclidine, and 
amphetamine results.  
Additional  information regarding sam ple collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_211389] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine and Serum Pregnancy Test  
Female patients who are of childbearing potential will undergo serum and urine 
pregnancy tests at the study clinic at Screening  (Visit 1 ), at Baseline  (Visit 2, Day 1), and, 
at the discretion of the Investigator, at an Unscheduled Visit. At Visit 5 and Visit 8/ET, 
urine pregnancy tests will be administered.  
Serum pregnancy testing will be performed using blood collected as part of protocol -
speci fied sample; urine pregnancy testing will use a urine dipstick.  
If the urine and serum pregnancy tests at screening are positive, the patient will not be 
eligible to participate in the study. If a urine pregnancy test is negative and the associated 
serum p regnancy test is positive, the patient will be discontinued from the study.  
8.3.6  Other Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Extrapyramidal Scales  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale  
The AIMS ( Guy 1976 ) measures facial and oral movements, extremity movements, and 
trunk movements.  Seven items are rated on a scale from none (0) to severe (4). A score 
of “mild” in 2 or more categories or a score of “moderate” or “severe” in any 1 category 
results in a positive AIMS score (ie, the scores are not averaged). Additionally, overall 
severi ty is scored on the basis of severity of abnormal movements and incapacitation due 
to abnormal movements. The patient’s awareness of and distress caused by [CONTACT_211421]. The AIMS is to be completed at baseline and 
periodically in t he study according to Schedule of Events ( Table 1-1). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale  
The BARS is a rating scale for drug -induced akathisia developed by [CONTACT_143490] ( 1989 ). It 
includes the rating of observable restless movements, the subjective awareness of 
restlessness, and the distress associated with the akathisia. There is also a global rating 
for severity. The scal e is completed by [CONTACT_143491] -based rater after 
a standard examination. Objective akathisia, subjective awareness and subjective 
distress are rated on a 4 -point scale from 0 to 3, yielding a total score from 0 to 9. The 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  48 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 Global Clinic al Assessment of Akathisia is rated separately, on a 5 -point scale from 0 to 
4. The BARS is to be completed at baseline and periodically in the study according to 
Schedule of Events ( Table 1-1). 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Simpson -Angus Scale  
The SAS is a measure of extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson and Angus 1970). Ten 
items including rating gait, arm droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, 
leg pendulousness, head droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , glabella tap, tremor, and salivation are rated on a 
scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme in severity). The SAS should be conducted by [CONTACT_211422] -based rater in a room where the patient can walk a sufficient 
distance to  allow a natural pace (e g, 15 paces). Each side of the body should be 
examined. The SAS is to be completed at baseline and periodically in the study according 
to Schedule of Events ( Table 1-1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  C-SSRS  
The C -SSRS is a clinician -rated instrument that reports the severity of both suicidal 
ideation and behavior  (Posner, 2011 ). Suicidal ideation is classified on a 5-item scale:  
• 1 (wish to be dead)  
• 2 (nonspecific active suicidal thoughts)  
• 3 (active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan ] without intent to act)  
• 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) ; and  
•  5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent).  
The C -SSRS also captures information about the intensity of ideation, specifically the 
frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe types of 
ideation.  
Suicid al behavior categories are : 
• Actual attempt  
• Interrupted attempt  
• Aborted attempt  
• Preparatory acts or behavior  
• Presence of suicidal behavior  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  [ADDRESS_253273] recent attempts . 
The C -SSRS will be completed at all study visits. At Screening (Visit 1), the C -SSRS will 
be completed for  the patient ’s lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior 
(“Baseline/Screening ” version) . At all other visits, the C -SSRS will be completed for 
suicidal ideation and behavior since the previous visit (“Since Last Visit ” version) . Before 
the patient  leaves the study site, the Investigator or appropriately qualified designee will 
assess the patient ’s C-SSRS results.  
The patient  should not be released from the study center until the results of the C -SSRS 
are reviewed and the patient is not considered to be at risk. If there is doubt about whether 
a patient  is at risk, the Investigator must obtain appropriate psychiatric consultation. The 
results of the C -SSRS will be recorded in the eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Modified Physical and Neurological Examination   
A modified physical examination, including neurological and excluding genital/rectal 
examinations, will be performed. The examination should include evaluation of height ( m; 
at Screening /Visit 1  only); body weight (kg); waist circumference (cm); appearance and 
skin; head and neck; eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest and lungs; heart; abdomen; and 
extremities. Neurological findings will also be recorded. All physical examination findings 
must be d ocumented in the patient ’s study chart and also recorded in the eCRF .

 9 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to unblinding the patients ’ treatment 
assignments  and will provide further details regarding the defi nition of analysis endpoints 
and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. Changes made to the data 
analysis methods as described in the protocol will be documented in the SAP and will not 
necessitate a protocol amendment. All departures from t he statistical analyses described 
in the approved protocol, whether made before or after unblinding, will be documented, 
and justified in the final clinical study report.  
The study randomized 100 patients with Bipolar D isorder  (Bipolar I or  Bipolar  II) before 
Amendment 2.0 (dated 02 Nov 2020) . The efficacy data of these 100 patients will be 
combined with those of patients with Bipolar Disorder enrolled after Amendment 2.0 as a 
separate analysis.   
 
Table 9-1 presents an overview of the statistical data  analyses planned for all patients 
enrolled in the study.

Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  52 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 Blinded data review s will be conducted prior to unblinding the patients ’ treatment 
assignments for assessing the accuracy and completeness of the study database and 
defining analysis sets, patient evaluability, and appropriateness of the planned statistical 
methods.  
9.[ADDRESS_253274] size (treatment group difference relative to pooled SD) of 0.3 7 for 
lumateperone is based on a treatment difference of 3 .3 units with a common pooled SD 
of 9 for the primary efficacy parameter, change from baseline to Day 43 in MADRS total 
score. A sample size of 350 patients (175 per treatment group) will need  to be enrolled 
after the implementation of Amendment 2.0 (dated 02 Nov  2020) to  provide 90% power 
for primary analysis for the combined population of Bipolar Disorder with mixed features 
and MDD with mixed features based on an MMRM model using simulation method 
(Lu, 2012 ). The simulation assumed a correlation of 0.7 between the repeated measures 
and a dropout rate of 10% based on historical data .  
The assumed values of drop -out rate of 10%, correlation of 0. 7, and standard deviation 
of 9 are approximate estimates from a previous  successful study of lumateperone for 
bipolar depression. The assumed treatment difference of 3.3 used to obtain the power of 
90% is considered appropriate as the generated sample size can cover a wide range of 
clinically relevant treatment difference to b e detected as statistically significant.  
The study will enroll approximately equal number of patients  (175)  for the Bipolar Disorder 
with mixed features  and for MDD with mixed features  following Amendment 2.[ADDRESS_253275] size of 0.45, and same assumption s of drop -out rate and correlation 
between the repeated measures , this sample size (approximately 87 patients in each 
treatment group) for each of the two subpopulations is expected to provide approximately 
80% statistical power for the primary e fficacy analysis with the adjustment  of multiplicity  
for the testing of the primary analysis in each of the subpopulations .  
The study randomized approximately 100 patients under the original protocol before the 
implementation of Amendment 2.0 (dated  02 No v 2020) ; therefore, the total enrollment 
for the study will be approximately 450 patients . 
9.2 Planned Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned.  
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  53 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 9.3 Analysis Sets  
All Enrolled Set will contain  all patients who signed the informed consent for the study.  
All Patients Randomized Set will contain all patients who signed the informed consent 
and were randomized to study drug . 
Intent -to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set will contain all randomized patients who received at 
least 1 dose of study drug and who had a non -missing (pre -dose) baseline assessment 
and at least [ADDRESS_253276] -baseline assessment of MADRS total score.  
 
Modified Intent -to-treat ( mITT) Analysis Set will contain all randomized patients who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug and who had a valid  (pre-dose) baseline 
assessment and at least [ADDRESS_253277] -baseline assessment of MADRS total score and 
were enrolled after the implementation of Amendment 2.0 (dated 02 Nov 2020). Patients 
enrolled before the implementation of Amendment 2.0 will not be inc luded in the mITT 
Analysis Set.  
Sensitivity Set will contain all patients randomized  after the implementation of Amendment 
2.0 (dated 02 Nov  2020 ) and who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who had a 
valid (pre -dose) baseline assessment of MADRS total score.  Patients enrolled before the 
implementation of Amendment 2.0 will not be included in the Sensitivity Set.  
The B ipolar  Intent -to-treat ( bITT) Analysis Set will contain all randomized Bipolar Disorder 
patients who received at least [ADDRESS_253278] 1 dose 
of study drug . 
9.4 Statistical Analysis Methodology  
Categorical variables (e g, AEs) will be summarized using the number and percentage of 
patients in specified categories . Unless otherwise stated, the calculation of percentages 
will be based on the number of patients in the analysis set of interest. Continuous 
variables (e g, MADRS total score ) will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including  number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum.  
For analysis purposes,  baseline is defined as the last non -missing measurement before 
the first dose of  study drug . Assessments on Day [ADDRESS_253279] dose of  study 
drug. 
Unless stated otherwise, statistical tests will be performed at a 2 -sided significance level 
of 0.05, leading to 95% (2 -sided) confidence intervals (CIs).  
For efficacy analyses in which study site is a factor, a small site will be defined as a site 
with less than [ADDRESS_253280] one treatment group for each  specific analysis set  (ie, 
the mITT Set, the Bipolar Disorder with mixed features based on mITT Set, the MDD with 
mixed feature based on mITT Set, and the bITT Set ). Small site s in each specific analysis 
set will be pooled to form pseudo -sites so that each treatment group includes at least 
2 patients within the site. Pooling will be performed  separately for each analysis set but  
using the same algorithm described as the following : 
Based on the number of patients, small sites will be ordered from the largest to the 
smallest, and sites of the sa me size will be ordered from the largest site code to the 
smallest site code. The pooling process starts with the largest small site from the top, 
which will be pooled with the smallest from the bottom until a non -small site is formed. 
The process will be repeated using the small sites left out after the first pass. If any sites 
are left out at the end of the process, they will be pooled with the smallest pseudo site. If 
there is more than [ADDRESS_253281] site code will be selected.  
All statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® software Version 9.[ADDRESS_253282] -treatment medications, defined by [CONTACT_211423], will be summarized by  [CONTACT_107623] (ATC) code,  preferred term and treatment group  for the Safety Analysis Set  as 
outlined in Table 9-1. Patients with multiple occurrences of a medication in the same 
preferred term will only be counted once within the preferred ter m. 
During the study, a patient may be treated with zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_211390] 6.6. The 
number and percent of patients in the Safety Analysis Set receiving zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_211391], for each week during the Double -blind T reatment Period and for post -
treatment with lumateperone . 
9.4.3  Study Drug  Exposure and Treatme nt Compliance  
Exposure to study drug and treatment compliance will be presented using the Safety 
Analysis Set  as outlined in Table 9-1. Duration of ex posure (days) and dosing compliance 
(%) will be calculated and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Additionally, the number and 
percentage of patients exposed to study drug  will be presented by [CONTACT_95839], defined 
by [CONTACT_211424].  
9.4.4  Analysis of Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of lumateperone 42  mg based on the 
following primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints : 
• Primary Endpoint – Change from baseline to Day 43 in the MADRS total score.  
• Key Secondary Endpoint – Change from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_253283] model  for repeated measures (MMRM) method  based on the mITT Set . The 
model will include the change from baseline at each pre -specified time point in the 
MADRS total score as the response variable ; treatment group  (lumateperone 42  mg and 
placebo) , visit, site (or pooled site) , the stratification factor at screening  (Bipolar  I, 
Bipolar  II, or MDD) , and treatment group -by-visit interaction as factors ; and  the baseline 
MADRS total score and visit -by-baseline MADRS total score interaction as covariates . An 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used to estimate the covariance among repeated 
measurements within patient. In the event the convergence cannot be attained with the 
unstructured correlation matrix, the following alternative structures will be attempted in 
the specified order: heterogeneous Toeplitz structure (TOEPH), heterogeneous 
Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  56 ITI-007-403 Protocol         27 Jan 2023  
 autoregressive(1) (ARH(1)), heterogeneous compound symmetry (CSH), No Diagonal 
Factor Analytic (FA0(q), with q equal to the number of time points), Toeplitz structure 
(TOEP), autoregressive(1) (AR(1)), and compound symmetry (CS). Model parameters 
will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. The Kenward -Roger approx imation 
will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom.  
The MMRM method described above will also be used  for the primary efficacy analyses 
based on the subpopulation of Bipolar Disorder with mixed features in the mITT Set and 
based on the subpopulation of MDD with mixed features in the mITT Set .  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline to Day 43 in the CGI -S score , 
will be analyzed based on the mITT Set using an MMRM method similar to the one 
specified for the analysis  of the primary efficacy endpoint , but replacing MADRS total 
score with CGI -S score for the baseline and baseline -by-visit interaction terms as 
covariates in the model.  
The MMRM method for the key secondary efficacy endpoint will also be applied to the 
key secondary efficacy analyses based on the subpopulations of Bipolar Disorder with 
mixed features in the mITT Set and based on the MDD with mixed features in the mITT 
Set.

9.4.6  Safety Analyses  
All safety parameters will be summarized using the Safety Analysis Set as outline d in 
Table 9-1.  
Safety data such as reported and observed AEs, treatment emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) and 
SAEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, physical examinations and neurological 
findings, ECGs, YMRS , AIMS, BARS, SAS, and C-SSRS) will be summarized by [CONTACT_211425] . When appropriate, out -of-range values will be flagged 
in data listings and tabulated. Shift tables will be prepared for pre-specified safety measures, 
such as laboratory parameters  and ECG . Parameters collected in duplicate or triplicate will 
be analyzed as an average of the measures for the relevant time poin t, including baseline.  
Reported AE terms will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). TEAEs are defined as any AEs, regardless of the 
relationship to study drug, that occur or worsen in  severity  after the first dose of study 
medication and on or before  the date of last dose of study medication plus one day . 
Treatment -related TEAEs will be defined as any TEAEs that are considered by [CONTACT_211426], probably, or definitely related to study drug . If relationship 
to study drug is missing, the TEAE will be considered as treatment -related. Severity of 
TEAEs will also be determined by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator . All TEAEs, treatment -related TEAEs, and 
SAEs  will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], primary system organ class categories, and 

Intra-Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], Inc. Confidential  [ADDRESS_253284] one abuse -related TEAE will be summarized by [CONTACT_7416] -specified categories.  
Laboratory assessments, including hematology and chemistry, vital signs and ECGs, will 
be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_6982]. Summaries may include actual 
and change from baseline, incidence of potentially clinically significant (PCS)  values 
during the Double -blind Treatment Period  according to normal range criteria  and shifts 
from baseline to the end of Double -blind Treatment Period . Listing s may be provided for 
patients meeting the PCS criteria.   
For the C -SSRS, the number and percentage of patients who have suicidal ideation or 
suicidal behaviors will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Supportive listings will be 
provided that include treatment group, assessment date, lifetime history, and 
postbaseline values for each patient. Intensity of suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior type , 
and lethality of suicidal behavior will also be included in these listings.  
The observed and change from baseline in YMRS , AIMS, BARS, and SAS will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_35080]. 
Additional details for analyses on safety assessments will be provided in the SAP. 
9.5 Protocol Deviations  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures or processes approved by [CONTACT_1035]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_3786]. A significant deviation o ccurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol by 
[CONTACT_211427] a significant, additional risk to the patient or have 
any impact on the efficacy analyses. Significant deviations can include nonadherence to 
inclusion or exclu sion criteria, enrollment of the patient without prior sponsor approval, or 
nonadherence to FDA or local regulations or ICH GCP guidelines and may lead to the 
patient being withdrawn from the study ( Section 5.5). 
The Investigator or designee must document and explain in the patient ’s source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The Investigator may

to study patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an 
occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed 
protocol amendments should be subm itted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the 
Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
The IRB/IEC should be notified of all protocol deviations in a timely manner , according to 
local requirements . 
Major protocol deviat ions observed during the Double -blind Treatment Period will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_211428] 9-1 using the ITT Set .

and Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations by [CONTACT_211434], including but not limited to : 
• A completed and signed Form FDA 1572. If, during the course of the study, any 
changes are made that are not reflected on Form FDA 1572, a new Form 
FDA [ADDRESS_253288] be completed and returned to the Sponsor for submission to 
the FDA 
• A fully executed contract  
• The curricula vitae for the Investigator and all sub -investigators listed on Form FDA 
1572, including a copy of each physician’s license  
• Financial disclosure agreement completed and signed by [CONTACT_211435]-investigators listed on Form FDA 1572. The Invest igator and all sub -
investigators will provide an updated financial disclosure agreement to the Sponsor 
1 year after the completion of the study.  
• A copy of the original IRB/IEC  approval for conducting the study. If the study is 
ongoing, renewals must be submitted at yearly intervals. All subsequent 
modifications must be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_1201] /IEC.  
• A copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF  
• A copy of the HIPAA authorization fo rm, or other applicable local privacy forms  
• A list of the IRB/IEC members or the US Department of Health and Human 
Services general assurance number  
• A copy of the laboratory certifications and reference ranges  
• The Investigator’s S ignature  page in this prot ocol signed and dated by [CONTACT_3786]  
11.[ADDRESS_253289] each patient’s use. All unused study  
drug must be returned to the Sponsor -designated central dep ot. 
11.[ADDRESS_253290]. However, if required 
by [CONTACT_67836], these 
documents should be retained for a long er period. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor 
to inform the Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be 
retained.  
11.[ADDRESS_253291] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_211392], the Investigator 
agrees to maintain adequate case histories for the patients treated as part of the research 
under this protocol. The Investigator agrees to maintain accurate eCRFs and source 
documentation as part of the case histories. These source documents may include 
records of screening assessments such as the  MINI, laboratory reports, and ECG 
tracings . 
After database lock, each study site will receive documentation  containing all of their 
study site -specific eCRF data as entered into the electronic data capture ( EDC ) system , 
including full discrepancy and audit history. Additionally, documentation  of all of the study 
site’s data will be created and sent to the Sponsor for storage. The CRO will maintain 
duplicate copy for its records.  
In all cases, patient initials and other protected patient information will not be collected or 
transmitted to the Sponsor.  
12.1 Data Monitoring  
Before any patient  enters the study, a re presentative of the Sponsor will meet with the 
Investigator and the study center personnel to review the procedures to be followed 
during the study. EDC functionality training is provided via computer -based training to 
train Investigators and authorized de signees on recording the data in the eCRFs using 
the EDC system.  
The Investigator will maintain complete source documents (eg, signed ICFs, written or 
electronic medical records, pharmacy records). Source documents provide evidence for 
the existence of stu dy patients and substantiate the integrity of the data collected in the 
eCRF. The Investigator will make available to the Clinical Monitor or designee source 
documents (written notes and electronic medical records, if used), signed ICFs, and all 
other stud y-related documents.  
Clinical Monitors,  appointed by [CONTACT_1034], will perform ongoing source document 
verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of  patie nts are protected; and 
that the study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any 
other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. After the 
first patient  is enrolled, the Clinical Monitor or designee , will periodically monitor the

12.[ADDRESS_253292] all patients’  study data in the eCRF, unless the data are transmitted to the Sponsor 
electronically (eg, laboratory data). Data entered in the eCRF must be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The Investigator is 
responsible for verifying that all data entries are accurate and correct. The Investigator 
may need to request previous or external medical records to support study data.  
The Sponsor is responsible for the data management of this study, including quality 
checking of the data. The Sponsor or designee will review study data for completeness, 
logic, and protoc ol adherence, using a combination of manual review and programmatic 
edit checks. After data entry into the EDC system by [CONTACT_18370], a 
combination of manual and programmatic edit checks will be used to review the data for 
completeness, lo gic, and adherence to study protocol. As a result of these edit checks, 
data monitoring, and reviews, queries may be electronically issued to the study center 
and should be answered electronically via the EDC system. Each query will carry 
identifying infor mation (assigned username, date, and time) to assist the Sponsor and the 
Investigator on the origin of the data clarification request and the response provided by 
[CONTACT_737]. All data changes made to the patient’s data via a data query will be 
approv ed by [CONTACT_143506].  
The Investigator or designee will be responsible for approving all changes to the data and 
endorsing the  patient data within the EDC system. This approval method will include 
applying an electronic signa ture linked to a uniquely assigned username [CONTACT_211440] a traditional handwritten signature. After all data have been 
reviewed and all issues have been resolved, the database will be locked.  
All data collected in the context o f this study will be stored and evaluated per regulatory 
requirements and applicable guidance for electronic records. Also, data will be stored and 
evaluated in such a way as to guarantee patient confidentiality in accordance with the 
legal stipulations ap plying to confidentiality of data. Study records (eg, copi[INVESTIGATOR_1495], 
laboratory reports, and regulatory documents) will be retained at the study center, along 
with adequate source documentation, according to FDA and ICH requirements. All study 
records mu st be available for inspection by [CONTACT_1034], its authorized representatives, 
the FDA, or other health authorities.

 Source documents will be used at the study centers and may include a patient’s medical 
record, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], clinic charts, the Investig ator’s patient study files, as well as the 
results of diagnostic tests such as laboratory tests, ECGs, etc. A  centralized clinical 
laboratory will be used for the analysis of all blood samples. Additional information on the 
collection and handling of sampl es is detailed in the Laboratory Procedure Manual .

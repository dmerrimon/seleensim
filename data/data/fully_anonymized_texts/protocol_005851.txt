Study Comparing Two Depression Management Interventions for Teens with Depression  
 
Objectives  
(1) Our purpose is to test the Trust-building depression S elf-Management Together ( TRUST ) 
intervention among adolescents with moderate depressive symptoms. Our premise is that trust 
can be learned, that  increasing trust will improve self -regulation,  and improv ed self -regulation 
will influence depression management behaviors, which will decrease depressive symptoms 
and increase quality of life (QOL). The study aims are:  
Aim 1. Compare the effects of the TRUST intervention with a depression management 
interventi on on depression management behaviors (sleep, stress management, medication 
adherence, appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and health status (depressive symptoms, QOL) in adolescents wi th moderate depressive symptoms .  
Aim 2.  Assess whether the effects of the TRUST intervention on depression management 
behaviors (sleep, stress management, medication adherence, appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and health 
status (depressive symptoms, QOL) are mediated by (respi[INVESTIGATOR_25570] [RSA],  
behavioral interaction assessment, adolescent/parent trust self -reports, relationship quality, self -
regulation, family cohesion, social support, decision making, self -efficacy, rumination, 
decentering).  
Aim 3.  Assess the effects of potential moderators ( gender, race, perceived stress, parental 
monitoring, household income, parent level of education, parenting style, parent stress) on the 
relationship between the TRUST intervention and depression management behaviors and 
health status (depressive symptoms,  QOL).  
(2) Hypothesis:   We hypothesize that variations in adolescent/ parent trust -building will predict 
response to the TRUST intervention and depression management behaviors as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_25597].   
 
Background 
(1) Depress ive symptoms are a serious concern affecting the social, academic, and health  
outcomes of 36% of Cleveland adolescents.
[ADDRESS_24460] in depression 
management —with low- income and minority adolescents more likely to forego treatment for 
depression.[ADDRESS_24461]  (CMSD)  schools are 
100% low -income and 84% ethnic minor ity.6 We are collaborating with CMSD to address health 
disparities in depression management among low income and minority adolescents. Our team 
has an 8 -year ongoing relationship with CMSD schools to improve the health of Cleveland’s 
children and their fam ilies.  
Depression among adolescents is affected by [CONTACT_25598], stress 
management, medication adherence, and appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], as well as  quality of 
relationship with parents. Family focused interventions are well established for reducing 
emotional and behavior al problems in adolescents, and function in part, by [CONTACT_25599] -parent relationships.7 Rotenberg describes adolescents’ trust of their parent as 
made up of: (a) honesty, which is telling the truth and engaging in benign and genuine 
behaviors; (b) reliability, which is perceived compatibility between one’s words and actions; and 
(c) emotional connection, which is the dependence on others to be receptive to disclosures and 
maintain confidentiality of disclosures.[ADDRESS_24462] between adolescents and their parents, alongside depression management behaviors.  
(2) Preliminary data. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], we are evaluating the effects of the novel TRUST 
intervention to improve depression management behaviors in adolescents with depressive 
symptoms. PI [INVESTIGATOR_25571]

RSA is an indicator of heart rate variability in response to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516],12 which is a marker of self -
regulation.11,13 We will assess RSA during a behavioral assessment of the quality of adolescent -
parent interaction using microsocial coding approaches.14,15 Co-I Connell has shown that RSA is 
associated with mutual positive affect16 and emotion regulation15 in adolescent -parent behavioral 
interactions.  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
(1) Screening . Using an existing collaboration with the CMSD school system, participant s will 
be recruited via advertisements in parent meetings at CMSD schools and social media. Candidates whose parents indicate interest by [CONTACT_25600], email, message, or completing an 
online prescreening tool will be contact[CONTACT_25601] t o recruit, screen, and 
enroll participant s. Adolescents will complete the PHQ -8 measure of depressive symptoms over 
the phone or by [CONTACT_25602] a tablet computer. A PHQ8 score >8 and <20 will be 
considered for study inclusion. Screening the adolescent with the PHQ8 confirms that the adolescent currently has moderate depressive symptoms and will occur during the screening process, prior to consent/assent. We have requested a waiver of consent on page 7 for 
screening purposes.  
 
 (2) Inclusion (adolescent)  
1. A Cleveland Metropolitan School District student  
2. Ages 14 -17 years old  
3. Repo rts diagnosis of depression  
4.  Reports mod erate depressive symptoms (PHQ -8 score >8  and <20)  
5. Able to read, speak, and understand the English language  
 Inclusion (parent/guardian)  
1. Female parent/guardian  
2. Able to read, speak, and understand the English language  
 
 (3) Exclusion (adolescent)  
1. Current suicide risk  
2. Diagnosis with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or a personality disorder  
3. Sever behavioral problems that preclude group participation (as reported by 
[CONTACT_7078])  
4. Family plans to move from the region within one year  
 Exclusion (parent)  
1. Family plans to move from the region within one year  
 
Number of Research Participants  
(1) N = 30 adolescent/parent dyads   
(2) Single site study, N/A  
 Vulnerable Populations  
(1) Vulnerable populations included are:   
 ☐ Adults unable to consent  
 ☒ Minors (infants, children, teenagers)   
  ☐ Wards of the state  
  ☐ Foster Children  
 ☐ Pregnant Women

 ☐ Neonates  
 ☐ Employees of CWRU or UHHS  
 ☐ Prisoners  
 ☐ Illiterate Individuals  
 ☐ Non-English Speaking  
 ☐ University Students  
 
(2) Minors will be recruited with permission of the parent/guardian during the process of 
informed consent with assent designated for acceptance by [CONTACT_25603]. Minors are the participant  of interest, since this is a pediatric study targeting adolescent particip ants with 
depression. The consent/assent document was designed with adolescents in mind, including 
simple and clear lay language to promote respect for (minor) persons with shared 
consent/assent decision- making between parent and adolescent. Drs. Hardin and Connell have 
conducted previous research protocols that involve adolescent -parent dyads and have 
experienced research assistants and established protocols for quality assurance, crisis 
intervention and referral, as well as initial and ongoing staff training. The research assistants hired for this project will have prior experience working with adolescent -parent dyads.  
Risks associated with study procedures (surveys, behavioral interaction, RSA) are not 
greater than encountered in daily life and will be m inimized with careful attention to adolescent 
participant  needs.  There is the potential for stigmatization due to depression diagnosis; 
however, measurements are taken in private and all results are reported privately in a sensitive and culturally appropriate manner.  If questionnaires indicate symptoms suggestive of severe 
depression or suicidal ideation, the results will be reviewed with [CONTACT_25632], Ph.D. (co -
investigator, licensed clinical psychologist, #6732) who will consult with the adolescent and/or 
parent/guardian to determine whether the adolescent or parent/guardian is in need of a referral 
for further evaluation and treatment. The nature of this study includes adolescents with a 
diagnosis of depression. If the adolescent becomes upset during study procedures, a study 
research assistant and the participant ’s parent will be available to support and comfort the 
adolescent participant  if needed. The adolescent/parent dyad will be given an information sheet 
with the number of United Way First Call (211) to access on call mental health professional services in their local area or Cuyahoga County 24- Hour Mental Health Crisis Information and 
Referral Hotline (216 -623-6888). If the participant  is unable to be comforted by [CONTACT_25604], the Mobile Crisis Team from the Cuyahoga County 24- Hour Mental Health Crisis, Information, and Referral Hotline will be 
contact[CONTACT_15608]. In addition, our Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will include an individual with expertise and experience conducting research studies with minor 
participants.  
(3) P
regnant women are not targeted for inclusion in this study, but will not be excluded in this 
study. Non-English speaking individuals will be excluded in this study. At this time, our study 
does not have the means to accommodate non- English speaking participants . This is a small 
(N=30), proof of concept, pi[INVESTIGATOR_25572]. Once our team  
has evidence that trust -building interventions are effective, we will expand our reach with larger 
studies, which will include non- English speaking families.  
 
Recruitment Methods  
(1) The target population are CMSD school students 14 -17 years old diagnosed with depression 
and a parent. CMSD has 41 high schools enrolling approximately 10,000 students 14- 17 years 
old. According to a recent screening, approximately 36% of CMSD high school students 
reported depressive symptoms, which is approximately 3,600 students ages 14- 17 years old.

(2) Using an existing collaboration with the CMSD school system, participant s will be recruited 
via mailed invitation letters, advertisements in parent meetings at CMSD schools, community 
events /locations, on the public bus system,  and social media. Due to COVID -19  safety  
restrictions, in person recruitment will follow all guidance made by [CONTACT_25605] (wearing 
masks, washing hands, or stay at home when appropriate ). Parents of participants in our 
previous studies that have consented to notifications of  future research will be mailed or emailed 
study information letters and study flyers.   
(3) [LOCATION_009]s Payne Bolton School of Nursing investigators have used this recruitment approach 
in a depression management study in which 52 adolescents were recruited in one year. Our study aims to enroll 30 adolescent/parent dyads. Candidates whose parents return a phone call, 
message, or online prescreener indicating interest will be contact[CONTACT_25606], screen, and enroll participant s.  
(4) Study flyers will be provided to school nurses, school administrators, and school guidance 
counselors for distribution to parents either electronically or, once restrictions associated with 
the COVID -19 pandemic are lifted, in- person. Similarly, once restrictions associated with the 
COVID -19 pandemic are lifted, w e will also use traditional methods of recruiting and flyer drops, 
targeting community venues including branches of the local public library, commercial retail outlets, and community parks, recreational facilities, and places of congregation (e.g. , churches, 
temples). Public bus advertisements will include paid advertising on the interior of the bus, aimed at bus riders.  These materials will be used to recruit participants during visits with school 
staff, during visits to community venues, and while riding the public bus system.  
 (5) Advertisements on public buses and Facebook will include a brief description of the study 
eligibility and study contact [CONTACT_3031], while flyers and brochures will include greater details 
about the study, eligibility, and contact [CONTACT_3031]. The stud y recruitment materials are attached 
with this application.  
Facebook advertisements  will be used to advertise the study and evaluate potential eligibility for 
the study (See Facebook Level Up study advertisement attached). This Facebook 
advertisement will  be targeted to parents of adolescents 14- [ADDRESS_24464] school. The Facebook advertisement will be linked to a 
prescreening tool in REDCap to evaluate potential eligibility for the study. Facebook 
advertise ments will take four  forms :  1) study advertisements, 2) fun posts , 3) page shares, and 
4) targeted advertising. Examples of  Facebook advertisements and the prescreening form are 
attached with the study application.  
A. Study advertisements. We plan to periodically post the following Level Up study 
advertisements on our study Facebook page to assist in recruitment and keep the page active:  
a. “Greetings from the Level  Up team  at Case Western Reserve University [LOCATION_009]s 
Payne Bolton School of Nursing! We are actively recruiting for our program helpi[INVESTIGATOR_25573]. If you have a 14- [ADDRESS_24465] school and would like more information about our program, please give us a call. Our office  phone is 216-
368-5129, and our email address is [EMAIL_417].   We look forward to 
hearing from you! ” 
b. “Are you the parent or guardian of a teen ages  14-[ADDRESS_24466] school? Would you and your teen like to join a program to learn how to live healthier and feel better? Simply click the blue 
“Sign Up Now” button, fill out the form, and one of our study team members will 
be in contact [CONTACT_25607].  Participants will be compensated for their time. ” 
c. “We are look ing for parents and guardians of teens ages [ADDRESS_24467] who are interested in joining our healthy 
 HRP -503BIO  Biomedical Protocol  
Approved:  1/23/2018  Prior Version:   
 
  Page [ADDRESS_24468] us or click on the 
“Sign Up Now” button. Participants will be compensated for their time.” 
B. Fun posts. We will make fun Facebook posts to maintain presence and activity of our Facebook page. For example, we may make posts about secular holidays such as, “Wishing Cleveland families a Happy New Y ear!”  
C. We will ask other pages to share our page or recruitment posts with their followers. These other pages include [LOCATION_009]s Payne Bolton School of Nursing, the Cleveland 
Metropolitan School District, local parent groups, local community groups, local 
churches, and national parenting groups.   
D. We will also use paid, targeted advertising on Facebook. These ads will target parents of high school age children in Cleveland.  
With the online prescreener form, parents will be contact[CONTACT_25608] t he 
following conditions are met:  1) parent indicates interest in the study, 2) parent indicates 
concern about their teen’s stress/ mood, and 3) parent provides their contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
 Setting  
(1) Due to restrictions associated with the COVID -19 pandemic, this study will be delivered in a 
remote format. Enrolled families will complete surveys via an electronic device connected to the 
internet, and intervention sessions will similarly be offered in a virtual  (phone or video 
conferencing)  format . When restrictions associated with the COVID- 10 pandemic are eased, the 
survey, behavioral, RSA, and intervention components of this  study will be conducted in 
research laboratories at the [LOCATION_009]s Payne Bolton School of Nursing and the Department of 
Psychology at Case Western Reserve University. The intervention session component of this 
study will be conducted at private community locations (e.g., library meeting rooms) that are 
convenient for enrolled study participants  once covid -19 restrictions are eased. (2) Using an 
existing collaboration with the Cleveland Metro School District, participants will be recruited from 
parent meetings, the community at large,  public bus system, and Facebook advertisements.  
(3) D ue to the COVID -19 pandemic, assent/consent will be obtained online using a REDCap 
survey facilitated by a phone call with a research assistant  to verify understanding of the study . 
When restrictions associated with the COVID -19 pandemic are eased, assent/consent will be 
obtained in-p erson using the following process . First, c onsent/ assent will be obtained at either 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_25574]’s research space at the School of Nursing or [CONTACT_25632]’s research space at the 
Department of Psychology. Next, participants will complete surveys on tablet  computers  either 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_25574]’s research space at the School of Nursing or [CONTACT_25632]’s research space at the 
Department of Psychology. Parent/teen dyads will then be taken to Co- I Connell’s lab at the 
Department of Psychology where they will be seated  in comfortable chairs in separate, quiet 
research rooms. Research assistants will then provide an overview of the physiological 
equipment, including the manner of attaching all recording sensors.   
 
Consent Process  
Indicate whether you will be obtaining consent: 
☒ Yes  ☐ No 
 
We will recruit participant s using an  IRB-approved protocol. All participant s will be required 
to give informed written assent/consent to participate in the project. Assent will be obtained from 
adolescent participant s and consent will be obtained from the parents. No waiting period will be 
required between screening and consent. Trained research personnel will read, review, and discuss assent/consent forms with all potential participants prior to asking them to sign. It is 
anticipated that it will take approximately 30 minutes to complete the consent/assent process, but participant s may take as long as they need to make a decision. Participant s that seem 
 HRP -503BIO  Biomedical Protocol  
Approved:  1/23/2018  Prior Version:   
 
  Page 7 of 23  
unsure about consent/assent will be encouraged to discuss it at home and contact [CONTACT_25609] a 
decision is made. If the candidate appears confused or indicates a lack of understanding,  the 
interviewer will attempt to identify the misunderstanding and to explain the form again. Any candidate who still does not comprehend the form will be excluded from the study. We will ask 
questions to confirm understanding of the material covered in the assent/consent procedure 
(e.g., “Could you tell me what’s going to happen if you take part in the study?”). Trained 
research personnel will witness and date the signed forms. Assent/consent procedures will take 
place in a private room or office. PI [INVESTIGATOR_25575] n will keep assent/consent forms in a secured file 
cabinet within a locked room. At each study visit, study personnel will ask participant s about 
their experience in the study (i.e. “How are things going for you in the study?”) and ask if they 
understand w hat is happening in the study (i.e. “ Do you know why you’re here today?” or Do 
you have any questions about the study?”).  
 
As consent is an ongoing process, s ubjects in the study may need to be re- consented/re -
assented to inform them of new study information and reaffirm their willingness to continue 
participating in the research. National and local guidance recommend s the use of the least 
burdensome approach for re -consenting/ re-assenting a subject.
42,43 The Office of Human 
Research Protections (O HRP) guidance for re -consent/ re-assent will be followed ,44 which 
includes re- consenting/ re-assenting  active participants and verbal communication with 
documentation in the study record  for participants who have already completed all study 
activities .  
The following is a list of how data will be handled  following attempts to re- consent/re- assent. In 
the event that an active particip ant does not  complete re -consent/re- assent , their partic ipation in 
the study  will be ended and their data will not be used for analysis . For subjec ts who have 
completed  all study activities and select not to  re-consent/ re-assent , their data will not be used 
for any new analyses. With a  subject who has completed all study activities and cannot be 
contact[CONTACT_25610]-consent/re- assent , only the survey data  included in previous IRB approvals 
(depressive symptoms, covid- 19 anxiety)  will be  used for  data analyse s. Finally, a ll subjects 
who are re-consented /re-assent ed and reaffirm their willingness to continue participating in the 
research  will have all data included in data analyses.   
 
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process or Documentation  
☒ I will obtain consent, but request a waiver for pre- screening purposes.  
(1) The online prescreener and screening phone call cannot be practicably conducted w ithout a 
waiver of consent/assent  for a number of reasons. The information collected for the prescreen 
does not involve any actual intervention or experimentation. Families will only have a 
prescreening done if they are volunteering to learn more about participating in the study. The 
purpose of the pre -screening is to clarify the dyad’s eligibility for the study prior to arranging a 
baseline visit to the lab space at Case Western Reserve University. This is necessary to avoid 
scheduling dyads for baseline visits only to find that they are not eligible, a situation that, if 
avoidable, would anger and disappoint families. Our community advisory board recommended that the process of prescreening be efficient and non- burdensome for families, and the 
proposed approach is designed to be consistent wi th their recommendations. It also avoids 
inappropriate use of CWRU resources. Further, no data will be collected except those pertaining 
to eligibility . To require full consent/assent  would create temporal and perceptual impediments 
for families who would otherwise be interested in participating and would likely reduce community engagement in the project substantially. Furthermore, the waiver applies only to the 
 HRP -503BIO  Biomedical Protocol  
Approved:  1/23/2018  Prior Version:   
 
  Page [ADDRESS_24469] will  compete a full consent/assent  prior to beginning the study.  
 
Additional Considerations for Consent Process with Adults  
Non English Speakers :  Not applicable. With this small (N=30), proof of concept, exploratory 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we are including only those who can speak, read, and understand the English language. Once effectiveness of the intervention has been established, we will include non-
English speakers.  We intend to develop a Spanish version of this intervention for use in future 
replication studies, once effectiveness of the intervention has been established.   
Adults Unable to Consent:
   Not applicable. The interventions under evaluation in this study are 
social/behavioral in nature and require the ability to read, speak, and unde rstand language , in 
addition to interacting one- on-one and in a group setting.  
 
Research Participants Who Are Not  Yet Adults ( teenagers)  
Parental permission be obtained from:  
☒ One parent even if the other parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably 
available, and shares legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.  
(1) With the non-invasive, low-risk nature of this study  with potential for participant benefit , we 
will require parental /guardian permission and involvement of only one pare nt/guardian. The 
screening form will  ask both the parent/guardian  and adolescent  for confirmation that the parent 
providing consent is a  legal parent/guardian of the child. Parental consent will be recorded with 
the either the selection of the “yes” checkbox in the electronic consent process during the 
COVID -19 pandemic or with the parent ’s signature [CONTACT_25629]/consent form once restrictions 
associated with the COVID -19 pandemic are ea sed. 
(2) All minor adolescents (ages 14- 17) will require consent of a parent or legal guardian.  All 
minor adolescents (ages 14- 17) will require assent.  
(3) Assent will be recorded with the either the selection of the “yes” checkbox in the electronic 
consent process during the COVID -19 pandemic or with the adolescent’s signature [CONTACT_25630]/consent form once restrictions associated with the COVID -19 pandemic are eased . 
Assent will be recorded with the adolescent’s signature [CONTACT_25631]/assent form. The 
consent/assent form has been designed with simple language appropriate for both adults and 
teens. A single consent/assent form treats participants  ages 14 -17 as autonomous individuals 
able to make decisions for their participation, while reducing burden on families with multiple 
documents.  
(4) Re -consent/assent addendum.  
 
Sharing of Results with Research Participants  
We will not be providing individual results to participants’, however, general group results will be 
shared with participant s at the end of the study, or as needed if the results may influence their 
decision to remain in the study.    
Study Design, Procedures, and Timeline  
(1) Study Design. We will use an e xploratory 2- group pi[INVESTIGATOR_25576], QOL, sleep, stress management, medication adherence, and appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25577] 3 months and 6 months in comparison to 
the effects of a D epression Management Intervention.  
(2 & 3) Research Procedures will include:  
a. Recruitment and Informed Assent/Consent : We will recruit participant s using an  IRB-
approved protocol. All participant s will be required to give informed written 
assent/consent to participate in the project. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, we will be

obtaining assent/consent online via REDCap . Research assistants will read, review, and 
discuss assent/consent forms with all potential participants prior to asking them to sign. 
If the candidate appears confused or indicates a lack of understanding, the interviewer 
will attempt to identify the misunderstanding and to explain the form again. Any candidate who still does not comprehend the form will be excluded from the study. We 
will ask questions to confirm understanding of the material covered in the assent/consent 
procedure (e.g., “Could you tell me what’s going to happen if you enroll in the study?”). 
Interviewers will witness  and date the signed forms. Assent/consent procedures will take 
place in a private room or office. PI [INVESTIGATOR_25578]/consent forms in a secured 
file cabinet within a locked room. Participant s will be enrolled in blocks of 10  dyads, 
using a block r andomization scheme to assign each of the 10 dyads to either study 
group. Once a group of 5 is filled, weekly intervention sessions will begin. 
b. Questionnaires: Survey data will be collected using REDCap on a tablet computer . 
Measures used in the study are listed in the Table below.  Due to restrictions associated 
with the COVID -[ADDRESS_24470] a

  Page [ADDRESS_24473]. Arin Connell, Ph.D. (co -investigator, licensed clinical psychologist, #6732) who will consult with the 
adolescent and/or parent/guardian to determine whether the adolescent or parent/guardian is in need of a referral for further evaluation and treatment. The nature 
of this study includes adolescents with a diagnosis of depression. If the adolescent 
becomes upset during study procedures, a study research assistant and the participant ’s 
parent will be available to support and comfort the adolescent participant  if needed. The 
adolescent/parent dyad will be given an information sheet with the number of United Way First Call (211) to access on call mental health professional services in their local 
area or Cuyahoga County 24- Hour Mental Health Crisis Information and Referral Hotline 
(216- 623-6888). If the participant  is unable to be comforted by [CONTACT_25613], the Mobile Crisis Team from the Cuyahoga 
County [ADDRESS_24474] :  The cheek swab DNA test is canceled due to COVID -19. The 
cheek swab DNA test includes swabbing the parent and adolescents’ cheek with separate sterile cotton swabs. Participants can remain in the study, but opt out of the 
DNA test, if they choose. Participants will be assured that we will not use the data for 
paternity testing. The sensation of a cotton swab in the mouth may feel uncomfortable 
for some. We will allow participants to swab their own cheek under guidance of study 
staff, if they prefer.  
e. Saliva sample collection: The saliva sample portion of the study  is canceled due to  
COVID -19. Saliva will be collected in a tube to measure salivary oxytocin. Fifteen 
minutes pre/post the dyadic behavioral interaction, measures of salivary oxytocin levels 
of both adolescents and parents will be collected using Salivattes and stored at - 80 
degrees centigrade until processed and analyzed. Study staff will provide guidance to 
participants on how to provide the saliva sample. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17270]  a tube may be 
uncomfortable  for some participants. Participants can remain in the study, but opt out of 
the salivary sample collection, if they choose. 
f. Behavioral interaction assessment :  The behavioral interaction is currently on pause 
and will only occur following the easing of restrictions associated with the COVID -[ADDRESS_24475] and uncomfortable to some participants. The paced breathing task and a 
practice discussion question are intended to help participants acclimate to the behavioral 
interaction  assessment. Participants may opt out of the use of audio/video capture of the

interaction. If participants refuse the use of the audio/video recording, study staff will 
make notes of the interaction instead.  
g. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_25570]: The RSA is on pause and will only occur following the 
easing of restrictions associated with the COVID -[ADDRESS_24476] of both parent and adolescent. This may be uncomfortable for some 
participants. To reduce discomfort and maintain privacy, the cardiac leads will be placed 
on the participants in a private room and by a same gendered study staff member, if 
requested.  
h. Intervention group protocol : Due to restrictions associated with the COVID- [ADDRESS_24477] -building topi[INVESTIGATOR_25580], reliability, and 
emotional connection.8 The honesty portion will include discussion and practice of 
disclosing personal truths and receptivity of others’ disclosures. The reliability portion will 
include discussion and practice of making and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25581]. The emotional connection portion will include discussion of adolescent -parent similarities and bonding 
activities like hugging and eye contact. The depression management portion will focus on sleep, stress management, medication adherence, and appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. 
The intervention will build depression management knowledge, set  personal and dyad 
goals, and practice self -monitoring. Goal -setting and self -monitoring of progress are also 
forms of making and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25581], thus connecting and reinforcing the concepts of trust and depression management techniques. The Depression M anagement  group 
will receive 8 sixty -minute weekly sessions that include the only the depression 
management training (sleep, stress management, medication adherence, appointment 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) described above. Both intervention groups will be led by [CONTACT_25614].  
The interventionist will have a teaching plan with guidelines on time use for TRUST 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Each session will include a trust -building topic and a depression  management 
topic, a discussion portion and a practice portion.  With the trust building portion, we will 
focus on honesty, reliability, and emotional connection. For example, the Honesty portion will teach adolescent and parent to share personal details about themselves 
without judging one another. Parents often get upset when their adolescent shares personal details with them and then jump to conclusions, judgment, and reprimands, 
which breaks down trust. The intervention will discuss this, then have adolescent -parent 
dyads practice sharing small truths and bei ng receptive to those disclosures. With the 
Reliability portion, we'll discuss that reliability means following through on your word. 
Dyads will make small promises to one another, then try to follow through on keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25582]. Emotional Connection is built when each 
person is receptive to disclosures and keeps promises.  
  With the depression self-management portion, we will focus on stress 
management, sleep, medication adherence, and appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25583] . We will 
discuss why these topi[INVESTIGATOR_25584]. 
Each adolescent -parent dyad will set goals to improve in each of these areas, then

Data Analysis Plan  
(1) Statistical Analyses. Each participant  will be assigned a unique identifier for tracking 
purposes and all raw data will be uploaded to the secure database in REDCap. We will explore all variables using descriptive statistics. To address the Aims 1- 2, we will use a linear mixed 
effects model. To address Aim 3, we will apply usual mediation techniques.  
 
Confidentiality of Specimens and Banking  
Salivary specimens and cheek swabs are canceled due to Covid- 19. Specimens collected prior 
to Covid -19 were handled as follows.  Salivary specimens and cheek swabs will be collected and 
banked until full processing can occur. The specimens will be stored in the [LOCATION_009]s Payne 
Bolton School of Nursing biomarker laboratory. Specimen testing is funded with internal monies; 
therefore, specimens will not be transferred to other researchers at this time.  
Saliva specimens  will be obtained from each adolescent at baseline and 3- month  data 
collections. The saliva samples will be collected by [CONTACT_25616] ’s alpha -numeric study identification code. Fifteen minutes pre/post the dyadic 
behavioral interaction assessment, measures of salivary oxytocin  levels of adolescents will be 
collected using SalivaBio passive drool salivary collection kits (Salimetrics LLC, State College, 
PA). Salivary s amples will immediately be placed on ice, trans ported to the laboratory by [CONTACT_25617], and transferred to a locked  -80°C freezer  until processed and analyzed. Time from 
collection to freezing will be less than [ADDRESS_24479] access to the specimens. The remainder of the 
specimens will be destroyed after analysis. The salivary oxytocin testing is funded with internal 
funding and will not be transferred to other researchers.  
Cheek swabs obtained by a Registered Nurse research assistant will be collected only a 
single time during the study and will be used for OXTR genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Registered Nurse 
research assistant will obtain the cheek  swabs, label them with the participant’s alpha- numeric 
study identification code,  transport them to the lab at the Case Western Reserve University 
[LOCATION_009]s Payne Bolton School of Nursing, and preserve them in lysis buffer until DNA extraction. OXTR rs53576 will be genotyped using the TaqMan genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_25586]. The TaqMan

Risks to Research Participants  
 (1) The level of risk from the proposed trial is no more than encountered in daily life and is 
minimal relative to other clinical trials that test  drugs, devices,  or medical procedures.  Of note, 
we will not be completing  the behavioral interaction, RSA, salivary samples, or cheek swabs  
portions of the study while restrictions associated with the COVID -[ADDRESS_24482] loss of 
confidentiality. However, it is possible that being seen on campus with members of our team will 
identify participants’ role in the Level Up Study to passersby.   
The risks associated with gathering information from participant s by [CONTACT_25611].  Participant s may experience discomfort by [CONTACT_25618]. In prior research, we have used these measures or 
similar measures with this adolescent -parent dyad population and found that adolescent -parent 
dyads were comfortable with the interviews. However, all participant s will be instructed that they 
can stop the interview at any time or can choose to skip any question that they wish. Our investigators and staff are experienced interviewers in research involving adolescent -parent 
dyads, and we have rarely encountered participant  reactions more adverse than transient 
awkwardness, embarrassment, or mild discomfort. We are prepared to deal with such events 
and have a protocol that instructs the data collector how to obtain assistance for psy chological 
issues should they arise.  
There is the potential for stigmatization due to depression diagnosis; however, 
measurements are taken in private and all results are reported privately in a sensitive and 
culturally appropriate manner.  The nature of this study includes adolescents with a diagnosis of 
depression. If the adolescent becomes upset during study procedures, a study research assistant and the participant ’s parent will be available to support and comfort the adolescent 
participant  if needed. If questionnaires indicate symptoms suggestive of severe depression or 
suicidal ideation, the results will be reviewed with [CONTACT_25632], Ph.D. (co- investigator, 
licensed clinical psychologist, #6732) who will consult with the participant to determine w hether 
the participant  is in need of a referral for further evaluation and treatment.  
(2) Although this study is deemed as having minimal risk, we recogniz e there are some 
unanticipated risks . An example on an unanticipated risk is that participants may be 
disappointed with the intervention group to which they are assigned.  
(3) As a social/behavioral intervention study, n o procedure in this study is a risk to an embryo or 
fetus should the research participant may or may become pregnant.   
(4) There are  no known  risks to others who are not research participants.  
(5) Drs. Hardin and Connell  have conducted previous research protocols that involve 
adolescent -parent dyads and have experienced research assistants and established protocols 
for quality assurance, crisis intervention and referral, as well as initial and ongoing staff training. 
The research assistants hired for this project will have prior experience working with adolescent -
parent dyads. If questionnaires indicate symptoms suggestive of severe depression or suicidal ideation, the results will be reviewed with [CONTACT_25632], Ph.D. (co- investigator, licensed 
clinical psychologist, #6732) who will consult with the youth and/or parent/guardian to determine 
whether the youth or parent/guardian is in need of a referral for further evaluation and treatment.

  Page [ADDRESS_24483] participants’ privacy, several measures will be taken. During COVID- [ADDRESS_24484] that would allow 
the staff to see the participants’ questionnaire responses. Both parents and adol escents will 
receive separate tablet computers to complete the questionnaires simultaneously, so that 
participants are each engaged with their own questionnaires and promote privacy of the other 
participant. If participants are uncomfortable with the tablet computer, we will make 
arrangements to complete the questionnaires by [CONTACT_3445]’s choice of interview by [CONTACT_25619]. During the cheek swab, participants will be allowed to swab their own 
mouths with direction from study staff, if the participants’ desire. When placing the heart rate 
monitoring leads on participants’ chests for the respi[INVESTIGATOR_25591], this will be 
done in a private room and by [CONTACT_25620], if desired by [CONTACT_4317]. During the behavioral interaction assessment, study staff will remain nearby [CONTACT_25621], in 
order to help adolescent and parent participants’ feel comfortable during the discussion.   
Paper and pencil questionnaire completion will be a rare event. In the event of 
participant’s choice or internet connectivity problems, survey data will be collected through 
paper and pencil surveys. Research staff will be responsible for entering survey data directly into REDCap once internet connectivity has become a non- issue. Paper and pencil surveys will 
be stored in a locked, filing cabinet in PI [INVESTIGATOR_25574]’s locked research office. Only key research staff will have access to this office and access to the key to the filing cabinet.  
  Potential Benefit to Research Participants  
Participant s participating in this research may learn new skills for better managing their stress 
and sleep quality; medication adherence and appointment keepi[INVESTIGATOR_25592]; and trust -building exercises may improve the quality of the adolescent -parent 
relationship.  These improvements may be short -term or long- term changes. We anticipate that 
our findings will demonstrate the linkages between a trust -building behavior change strategy 
and health behavior change that will help adolescents and parents improve their health.  
 Withdrawal of Research Participants  
Research participants will be withdrawn from the intervention without their consent under these 
circumstances:  
1. participant s display disruptive behavior during the group intervention sessions , 
2. evidence of  abuse between parent and adolescent dyad , or 
3. indication that a participant may be a harm to themselves or others .  
 
In the event that participants are removed from the intervention, PI [INVESTIGATOR_25593]. Participant  dyads will receive a closeout packet, which will contain a list of 
community resources for further depression symptom management treatment. Participants  will 
also receive study personnel contact [CONTACT_25622]. At this t ime, 
we will also update participant s’ contact [CONTACT_25623], if appropriate.  
 
Alternatives to Participation

(1) No one will be required to participate in our study. Other available clinical trea ts are 
individual, family, or group therapy . Community self -management treatments available include 
stress management classes, such as yoga .  
(2) Standard of care therapy, including depression medication and counseling, should be 
continued regardless of participation. Self -management treatments are considered adjuvant to 
clinical treatment. We anticipate and encourage our participants to continue standard of care 
therapy.  
(3) Since self -management training is adjuvant to standard of care treatment, another  option is 
to not participate.  
 
Costs to Research Participants  
(1) There are no costs to participation in this study. Our study compensates participants for their 
time and travel costs.  
(2) Participants’ health i nsurance will not be charged for any servi ces provided in this study.  
(3) This study will pay for the costs of transportation to study visits ; cost of group intervention 
sessions  including healthy snacks and small gifts ; time to complete study visits; costs of 
surveys; and costs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_25570]/behavioral interaction  testing.  
 
Research Participant Compensation  
Participation in the study requires time and effort. Because of this, c ompensation for time spent 
completing the study surveys, respi[INVESTIGATOR_25570] (RSA), and behavioral interaction 
assessment will be provided. Each adolescent and parent participant  will receive a $[ADDRESS_24485] 
for completing each structured interview and each behavioral interaction assessment with RSA . 
Thus, adolescent -parent dyad participant s who complete all interviews ($150 total) and undergo 
two behavioral interactions with RSA ($100 total) may receive a total up to $250. This amount is 
consistent with our prev ious work and is not perceived to be coercive by [CONTACT_25624].  
 During the intervention groups, participants may receive small gifts (each valued at less 
than $15) intended to assist them in meeting intervention goals. Participants may receive small 
gifts such as an eye mask to promote sleep, a 7 -day medication box to promote medication 
adherence, a book about parent/teen communication, and a yoga mat. Healthy snacks will be made available to participants during the group sessions. A schedule of compensation is listed 
below.

Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure t he Safety of Research Participants  
(1) The data and safety monitoring plan for this study includes an official committee. The 
committee members who are outside the study team will review data on the study as provided 
by [CONTACT_6283]. Hardin and Connell  and conduct random auditing of the research records to assess 
study safety and regulatory compliance.  Twice annually throughout the project, this committee 
will review data on this study regarding 1) study safety, including auditing selected cases for 
compliance with IRB requirements, conformance with informed consent requirements, 
verification of source documents, and investigator compliance; 2) minimizing research-associated risk; and 3) protecting the confidentiality of participant data. In addition, it  will review 
all causes of mortality and issues with participation. The rate of recruitment refusal (percent and reasons) and participant  attrition (percent and reasons) will be tracked and reported at these 
reviews. Differential attrition from the intervention arms also will be monitored. If concerns or problems are identified by [CONTACT_25625] (DSMC) , they will be

1 1R01 HL084155 -01A2  Specific  Aims 2 :   Define in humans with compensated CHF and renal 
dysfunction, the modulating action of chronic AT1 receptor blockade in addition to ACE inhibition on 
cardiorenal and humoral function  
Horng H Chen, John A Schirger, Paul McKie, Kent Bailey and John C Burnett  - IRB approved 9/17/[ADDRESS_220540] objective of this protocol is to advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of 
human  Cardiorenal  Syndrome  (CRS)  with a specific  emphasis  upon  the biological  interaction  betwee n 
diuretic  therapy,  the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system  (RAAS)  and cyclic  3′-5′-guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) pathway.   
Chronic  heart  failure  (CHF)  as a result  of left ventricular  systolic  dysfunction  is a clinical  syndrome  with high 
mortality  and morbidity.   Renal  dysfunction  is a common  and progressive  complication  of CHF and despi[INVESTIGATOR_186619],  or "Cardiorenal 
Syndrome  (CRS) ", its underlying  pathophysiology  is not well understood,  with a lack  of consensus  as to  its 
appropriate  management.  The CRS  can be classified  into [ADDRESS_220541] categories:  1) patients  with compensated 
CHF and impaired  renal  function;  and 2) patients  with decompensated  CHF and worsening  renal  function. 
Studies  have  established  that renal  dysfunction  is one of the most  important  prognostic  indicators  in patients 
with CHF,  suggesting  that it is a manifestation  of and/or  exacerbating  factor  for left ventricular  dysfunction.  In 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186620], worsening renal function is even more important than baseline 
renal function for predicting adverse outcomes. 
Diuretics  are effective  and necessary  to relieve  congestion  in CHF,  and some  studies  have  reported  that in 
CHF patients  with congestion,  diuretic  therapy  may have  favorable  neurohumoral  and hemodynamic  effects. 
In contrast, recent reports have suggested potential deleterious consequence of chronic diuretic therapy on the 
progression of CHF, specifically furosemide that is the most widely used diuretic in CHF. Others and we have 
reported  that in compensated  CHF patients,  furosemide  therapy  has deleterious  neurohumoral  and renal 
hemodynamic  effects  such  as renal  vasoconstriction  and activation  of the RAAS.   More  importantly  we 
demonstrated that angiotensin II receptor (AT1) blockade prevented the detrimental renal effects of diuretics in 
these  compensated  CHF patients.   In decompensated  CHF patients  who present  with the combination  of 
worsening renal  function,  volume  overload,  and diuretic  refractoriness, the management  of cardiorenal 
dysfunction is extremely challenging, and effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_186621].
The main  objective  of this study  is to translate  the findings  of the applicant’s  study  in experimental  CHF to 
human  CHF and determine  the modulating  actions  of chronic  AT1 receptor  blockade  in addition  to ACE 
inhibitor, beta-blocker and furosemide on cardiorenal and humoral function in humans with compensated CHF 
and renal  dysfunction.   Preliminary  studies  completed  by [CONTACT_186643]1 receptor blockade.  Furthermore, 
the applicant  also completed  a study  in human  compensated  CHF demonstrating  that acute  AT1 blockade 
prevented the detrimental renal effects of furosemide therapy. 
Hypothesis:  Chronic  AT1 receptor  blockade  in subjects  with compensated  CHF and renal  dysfunction  will 
improve  renal  function  with increased  sodium  excretion,  glomerular  filtration  rate and effective  renal  plasma 
flow and renal function reserve as compared to the response of placebo-treated subjects. 
This will be a  double-blinded placebo controlled study design . Subjects will be randomized to the Chronic 
AT1 receptor  blockade  or to  the placebo  group.  We will  compare the  effect  of 12  weeks  of Chronic  AT1 
receptor  blockade  with Candesartan  (n=38)  or placebo  (n=38)  on cardiorenal  and humoral  in subjects  with 
compensated CHF and renal dysfunction

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Chronic heart failure (CHF) sec ondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a clinical syndrome with 
significant mortality and morbidity despi[INVESTIGATOR_186622].  The latest figures from the American Heart Association repor ts a prevalence of [ADDRESS_220542] of 28 billion dollars in healthcare 
expense per year in the US.  
 
 Cardiorenal Syndrome  
Renal dysfunction is a common and progressive complication of CHF and despi[INVESTIGATOR_186623], or " Cardiorenal Syndrome (CRS) ", its 
underlying pathophysiology is not well understood, with a lack of consensus as to its appropriate management.  
The CRS can be classified into [ADDRESS_220543] categories: 1) patients with compensated  CHF and impaired  renal 
function; and 2) patients with decompensated  CHF and worsening  renal function.   
 
Recent studies have established the prognostic importance of renal func tion in both patients with compensated 
and decompensated CHF.  A multivariate analysis of the patients in the second prospective randomized study 
of Ibopamine on mortality and efficacy (PRIME) by [CONTACT_186644]1 demonstrated that estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) is the most powerful predictor of mortality, exceeding functional status and ejection fraction 
(EF).  Furthermore, a retrospective analysis of the studies in left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD) treatment 
trial and SOLVD prevention trial by [CONTACT_186645]2 confirmed that estimated GFR as an important determinant of 
survival.  Importantly, Dries et al demonstrated that a mild reduction of estimated GFR had an impact on 
survival even in patients who were asymptomatic. In patients who are hospi [INVESTIGATOR_186624], 
worsening renal function is also associated with worse outcome as reported by [CONTACT_186646]3 and Smith et al4 
in 2 separate studies. In both studies, an increase in plasma creatinine of 0.2 -0.3 mg/dL predicated a worse 
outcome.  Various studies have estimated that 25 -30% of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186625] g to prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186626].5-7 The acute 
decompensated heart failure national registry (ADHERE) da tabase enrolled 160,000 non -selected patients 
admitted to the 281 participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186627].  In this database, more than 
70% of the patients have moderate renal dysfunction as defined by [CONTACT_186647] 50 ml /min m2.  
Using the classification and regression tree analysis on the ADHERE database, inpatient mortality risk can be 
estimated by [CONTACT_186648], blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and systolic blood pressure.  It has been 
determined that patients wi th BUN > 43 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure of < 115 mmHg and serum creatinine of 
> 2.75 mg/dL had a 10 fold increase in inpatient mortality.8 
 
Pathophysiology of Cardiorenal Syndrome  
The underlying pathophysiology of cardiorenal syndrome is not well understood; it is most likely multifactorial 
and complex.  Decreased renal perfusion can lead to renal insufficiency; this may be caused by [CONTACT_186649] -angiotensin -aldosterone system 
(RAAS).9 Recent evidence suggests that both the natriuretic peptide (NP) and nitri c oxide (NO) cyclic GMP 
pathways are impaired in CRS and may contribute to the renal dysfunction.10,11 Renal cGMP generation, which 
is calculated as follows: [urine cGMP X urine flow] – [plasma cGMP X GFR}, is a marker of renal 
responsiveness to the NP and NO.[ADDRESS_220544] proposed the assessment of renal functional 
reserve (RFR), that is, the glomerular vasodilatory response to amino acid infusion (AA), as an index of th e 
intrarenal balance between vasocontricting hormones such as angiotensin II and vasodilators such as the NPs 
and NO.13,[ADDRESS_220545] recently completed a prospective study to 
assess the neurohumoral and renal hemodynamic profile in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186628]. (see Preliminary studies).  Our findings suggest that indeed the 
combination of pronounced activation of RAAS with decreased renal perfusion pressure (estimated by [CONTACT_186650]) and a relative deficiency of the NPs predisposes to the 
development of CRS.  
 
Among heart failure patients, several clinical features are more common in those who develop worsening renal 
function: On average, they are older and have a greater  prevalence of prior heart failure, renal dysfunction, 
diabetes, and hypertension.  Furthermore, a study by [CONTACT_70805] [ADDRESS_220546] 2004 stated in the executive summary that “It is clear that our current 
understanding of cardio -renal connections is inadequate to explain many of the clinical observations 
in heart failure or to direct its therapy. Further inves tigation is required to elucidate the pathways by 
[CONTACT_186651][INVESTIGATOR_014].” [ADDRESS_220547] questioned the safety of furosemide use in 
CHF.  McCurley et al demonstrated in a porcine model of CHF that furosemide use resulted in acceleration of 
both contractile and metabolic features of CHF, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction, elevated 
aldosterone and altered calcium handling27.  A retrospective analysis of the studies of left ventricular 
dysfunction (SOLVD) database reported that the use of po tassium sparing diuretic was associated with 
improved outcome as compared to non -potassium sparing diuretics.[ADDRESS_220548] also demonstrated in a canine 
model of mild/compensated CHF that chronic furosemide therapy resulted in activation  of RAAS and the 
development of renal resistance to exogenous NPs. (see Preliminary studies)  
 
In the congested  patient with LV systolic dysfunction, furosemide is extremely effective in relieving symptoms, 
reducing intracardiac pressures, and improving car diac performance. In non-congested  patients, administration 
of furosemide may result in disparate vascular and hemodynamic effects.  In an elegant study by [CONTACT_186652]29, 
they assess the effects of acute furosemide in  congested patients with LV systolic dysfunction and 
subsequently assess the effects of chronic furosemide in the same patients when they are non -congested.  
 [ADDRESS_220549] detrimental renal vascular and neurohumoral effects.31 (See Preliminary studies) More 
importantly, we demonstrated that acute AT1 receptor blockade prevented the detrimental renal hemodynamic 
effects with suppression of aldosterone. Previous studies have also established beneficial renal hemodynamic 
and excretory function of AT1 receptor blockade in experimental models of CHF.[ADDRESS_220550] preliminary result suggesting that in patients with 
compensated CHF on ACE inhibitor therapy and diuretics, plasma angiotensin II levels are still elevated.34 
(See Preliminary studies)  Thus, it is possible that noxious effects of diuretics on the RAAS may hence persist 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_94944] -inhibitor therapy and may affect prognosis adversely.  To date, the renal effects of AT1 blockade 
in patient with compensated CHF in  addition to ACE inhibition has not been assessed.  
 
Gaps in our knowledge  
The renal effect of AT1 blockade in compensated patient who is already on ACE -inhibitors and beta -blockers 
remains undefined.  
 
Significance  
Our proposed studies will advance our kno wledge of the integrated cardiorenal and humoral physiology in 
patien ts with cardiorenal syndrome.   Strategies that improve renal function in human cardiorenal syndrome 
may favorably affect clinical outcomes in this group of CHF patients, who have high mo rbidity and mortality and 
no proven effective therapy.  
 
PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
To understand the biological interaction between furosemide therapy, RAAS and cGMP pathway, the applicant 
has completed both laboratory -based studies in canine models of experiment al compensated CHF and Overt 
CHF with cardiorenal syndrome and more importantly Clinical Research Unit (CRU ) based patient orientated 
research studies and case control human studies, which are the basis for this application.  
 
Laboratory -Based Disease Orie nted Studies  
Chronic Angiotensin II (AT1) receptor blockade improved renal function and enhanced renal cGMP 
production by [CONTACT_186653]65 
A hallmark of overt/severe CHF is an attenuated renal cGMP production by [CONTACT_186654] 
(NP) and nitric oxide (NO), which may contribute to decline in renal function.  Previous studies h ave 
demonstrated that Angiotensin II activate PDE V resulting in increased cGMP degradation. We therefore 
hypothesized that chronic AT1 receptor blockade would restore the renal cGMP by [CONTACT_186655], with improved sodiu m excretion.   We determined the cardiorenal actions of 
chronic AT1 blockade (Valsartan, [COMPANY_001], 320 mg daily for 10 days, n=5) in a canine model rapid ventricular 
pacing induced overt CHF (245 bpm for 10 days) as compared to a non -treated group (n=5).  After 10 days of 
chronic AT1 receptor antagonism, urinary sodium excretion increased (UNaV) (12.4±3.3 vs 2.7±1.3 
uEq/min,p<0.05) in association with a marked increase in urinary cGMP excretion (UcGMPV) (1558±200 vs

 5 139±65 pmol/min, p<0.05) as compared to t he non -treated group. (Figure 1)The natriuretic response to AT1 
receptor antagonism was localized to the inner medullary collecting duct, a nephron site rich in natriuretic 
peptide receptors, as distal tubular fractional sodium reabsorption decreased in th e AT1 blocker group vs non -
treated group (97.6±0.3 vs 98.9±0.5 %, p<0.05). These renal responses occurred in the absence of any 
changes in plasma NPs or cGMP. Chronic AT1 also resulted in marked decreases in cardiac filling pressures 
(RAP: 3.4±1.1 vs 10.4± 1.6 mmHg, p<0.05 and PCWP: 15.4±1.9 vs 25.6±3.1 mmHg, p<0.05) and increased 
cardiac output (CO) (2.9 0.4 vs 1.9 0.2 l/min, p<0.05). (Figure 1)   We conclude that chronic AT1 receptor 
antagonism in experimental overt CHF enhances the renal cGMP production, the common secondary 
messenger for the NPs and NO resulting in improved renal tubular function and sodium excretion. This study 
provides insight into renal and humoral pathophysiological actions of angiotensin II and the AT1 receptor in 
CHF and mechanisms by [CONTACT_186656]1 receptor antagonism may mediate beneficial therapeutic properties.  
 
Angiotensin II AT1 receptor blockade prevents the detrimental renal actions of acute diuretic therapy in 
human heart failure in compensated human CHF which are mediated via th e renin -angiotensin 
aldosterone system 31 
To better understand the effects of renin -angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) on renal function in human 
heart failure, we defined the renal hemodynamic  and humoral actions acute AT1 blockade (Losartan, 50 mg 
orally) vs placebo in combination with Furosemide in 10 NYHA II -III CHF patients in a double -blind placebo 
controlled cross -over study.  Furosemide with placebo resulted in increased sodium excretion  (212±66 to 425±  
82 Eq/min, p<0.05) associated with reductions in both renal blood flow (307 ±30 to 246±23 ml/min,  p<0.05) 
and glomerular filtration rate (76 ±8 to 63±6 ml/min, P<0.05). (Figure 3)  However, after 4 hrs, there was a 
significant reduction in sodium excretion as compared to baseline (212 ±66 to 104± 21 Eq/min, p<0.05).  In 
contrast, Lasix with Losartan resulted in a similar increase in sodium excretion without reductions in renal 
blood flow and glomerular filtration rate .  Furthermore, after 4 h rs, sodium excretion was greater as compared 
to the placebo group.  Plasma aldosterone decreased only in the losartan group.  This study suggests that the 
RAAS via AT1 receptors may be involved in the detrimental renal effects of diuretics in CHF.  Therefo re, 
antagonizing the RAAS in CHF patients on diuretics may improve renal function, which is an important 
predictor of survival in human CHF.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Objectives  
The main objective of this study is to translate the findings of the app licant’s study in experimental CHF to 
human CHF and determine the modulating actions of chronic AT1 receptor blockade in addition to ACE 
inhibitor, beta -blocker and furosemide on cardiorenal and humoral function in humans with compensated CHF 
and renal dys function.  Preliminary studies completed by [CONTACT_186657]1 receptor blockade. (see 
Preliminary studies)  Furthermore, the applicant also completed a  study in human compensated CHF 
demonstrating that acute AT1 blockade prevented the detrimental renal effects of furosemide therapy. (see 
Preliminary studies)  
 
 Hypotheses  
 
1. Chronic AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with compensated CHF and renal dysfunctio n will improve renal 
function with increased sodium excretion, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow as 
compared to the response of placebo -treated subjects.  
 
2. Chronic AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with compensated CHF and renal dys function will improve 
humoral function with suppression of the aldosterone and increase renal cGMP generation as compared to 
placebo.  
 
3. Chronic AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with compensated CHF and renal dysfunction will improve left 
ventricular systol ic and diastolic function and filling pressures as compared to placebo as evident by:  
▪ Improvement in ejection fraction  
 6 ▪ Decrease in filling pressures with a decrease in the ratio of early mitral diastolic Doppler flow 
velocity (E) to tissue Doppler velocity  (e’) of the mitral annulus (E/e’)  
▪ Improved indices of diastolic function with an increase in the e’ velocity (faster relaxation)  
▪ Improvement in clinical status as measured by [ADDRESS_220551] of 12 weeks of Chronic AT1 
receptor blockade with Candesartan (n=38) or placebo (n=38) on cardiorenal and humoral in subjects with 
compensated CHF and renal dysfunction

ii) Study protocol  
After enrollment into the study, diet instructions will be given by a dietician about a no added salt diet, 2 -3 gm 
salt/day and 0.75 gm  protein /Kg/day  diet which will be ma intained throughout the study period. Baseline 
chemistry , ALT  and complete blood count will be obtained and subjects taking NSAIDs  except for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_186631].  A urine pregnancy test will be performed, if nece ssary.  
 
Twenty -four hour urine collection will be obtained one day prior to the active renal clearance study day for  
assessment of sodium excretion, creatinine clearance and m icroalbuminuria . . Sulfa containing medications 
and Probenecid will be withdrawn for [ADDRESS_220553] (if necessary) .. They will complete the Minnesota Living 
with Heart Failure Questionnaire  (MLHFQ) during their stay . Their usual morning dose of medications  (except 
diabetic medications)  will be taken at 07:[ADDRESS_220554] intravenous (IV) catheters will be placed (one in each 
arm). One catheter will b e used for infusion and the other (in the contralateral arm) for blood sampling.  
Subjects will be asked to drink 5 mL/Kg of water  initially and then drink the amount equal to the urine output 
every 30 minutes to ensure sufficient urinary flow. A priming d ose of Iothalamate (0.0053 mL/Kg) to measure 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) will be infused, followed by a constant rate IV sustaining dose (calculated 
according to estimated kidney function) of Iothalamate to achieve steady -state plasma concentrations o f 15 to 
20 mg/L.   The subjects will be asked to empty their bladder spontaneously every thirty minutes . 
 
After an equilibration period of 45 minutes, urine and blood samples are collected at 30 -minute intervals for 3 
periods to determine the baseline GFR and urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). Blood pressure will be measured 
at [ADDRESS_220555] dose of study drug in the CRU .  Subjects will be started at 4 mg once a day.  
Thereafter, both blood pressure and heart rate  (by [CONTACT_186660])  will continue to be monitored for the 
next 4 hours. If the patients develop symptomatic hypotension as defined by [CONTACT_186661] =< [ADDRESS_220556] dose tolerated.  Patients will get blood draw  7-10 days aft er each dose 
increase to measure plasma creatinine and potassium until target dose is achieved. If there shoul d be a 
potassium result <3.5 or > 6.0,  subjects wi ll need to have labs redraw n the same day. Thereafter, subjects will 
get blood draws every 4 weeks  (+/- 3 days) . If distance indicates, blood draws will be arranged at the 
participants local clinic. Subjects will also have access to a [ADDRESS_220557] it , along with heart rate and weight . They will also receive a weekly phone call to review status. During 
the study, if pat ient develops symptomatic hypotension as defined above or an increase of plasma creatinine of 
> 0.3 mg/dL or hyperkalemia > 5. 7 meq/ml, the dose will be reduced by 50%.  If those parameters persist, the 
dose will be decreased further by 50%.  At the discre tion of the investigator, the medication  can be 
discontinued.  
   
At the end of the twelve -week study period  (+ 7 days) , subjects will be admitted to the CRU again.  A 6-min 
walk, MLHFQ, echocardiography, renal clearance, humoral determination and renal fun ctional reserve will be 
performed in the same manner as the baseline study.  Subjects will also perform a 24 -hour urine collection the 
day prior to their return visit for determination of sodium excretion , creatinine clearance  and microalbuminuria .  
Subjec ts will be dismissed after the renal clearance study.  
 
iii) Sample size and statistical analysis  
The sample size calculation and statistical analysis have been designed in collaboration with the Division of Biostatistics, 
(Kent Bailey, Ph.D and David Hodg e, MSc).  
 
The primary analysis  for this study will be a comparison of the parameters of interest between the AT1 
receptor blockade group and placebo. This analysis will be completed using a two -sample t -test comparing the 
change from baseline to the latest  time point available. In addition to this primary analysis, if complete or near 
complete data is available, a secondary analysis will be completed using all data from baseline to the latest 
available time point. The groups will be compared in this analysi s using a 2 factor repeated measures analysis 
of variance. Values will be expressed as the mean + SE. A statistically significant difference will be considered 
to be present when p<0.05.  
 
Sample size calculation:  Preliminary data were obtained from the ap plicant’s previous study.  These data were 
used to estimate the standard deviation of the change in each parameter in the treated group.  It was assumed 
that the standard deviation in the untreated group would be only ½ of that in the treated group, since the 
treated group is composed of responders and non -responders, while the untreated group response data is 
largely due to biological and measurement variability between [ADDRESS_220558].  Preliminary data for this analysis is 
provided below .

Guidelines established by [CONTACT_186662].  
Standardized systems have been developed to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained. Each member 
of the department has undergone training in these systems at the time of their initial and ongoing employment 
training.  They include username/password access to data and  programs; the ability to log access; patient data 
displayed by [CONTACT_186663]; the use of numeric identifications on all patient listings and summary 
reports of statistical analyses.  All data sets and computer programs are logged within the Division of 
Biostatistics with respect to Institutional Review Board authorization, principal and secondary investigators, 
lead statistician, team statisticians, and accounting information. Working data are maintained on a single large 
file server (over 35 0 GB of user space) which serves the entire Section.  Inactive data files are moved to 
archival storage under the control of an automated system, itself controlled by a DBMS based request system 
which ensures that all data movement is appropriately logged and commented.  The archival storage is hosted 
on the institutional mainframe computer.  The use of the mainframe ensures several high -level support 
functions for the archive system, e.g. storage of media in separate fire zones and regular copying of data to 
new media.  All active data and programs are maintained on a central password -protected (UNIX) system 
accessible to the members of the Division of Biostatistics.  An audit trail of file access is available if necessary. 
Active data files are backed -up nightly and are available for retrieval at any time.  
 
Recruitment of subjects  
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria of the study will be recruited at the Mayo Clinic from the Heart Failure 
Clinic, Community Internal Medicine, General Internal Medicine , and past participants of [CONTACT_186672]’s studies . 
The Mayo Clinic Life Science System  (MCLSS) will aid recruitment for all the protocols.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Currently we have approximately 80 patients  who would qualify for Specific Aims 1 
and 2.   Hence using a conservative estimate of 20% recruitment success, we project a recruitment of [ADDRESS_220561] agree to use a 
reliable double barrier method of contraception until study completion.  A double barrier method of 
contraception is considered to be a combination of TWO of the following: birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]/implants/injections, 
intrauterine devices, sp ermicide, diaphragm or condoms.    
 
Upon identification of a subject, the study will be explained in detail, the consent form reviewed, questions 
answered and the consent form signed.  Protocol procedures will then begin to be scheduled.  Subjects will 
receive a reimbursement of $[ADDRESS_220562] acoustic windows according to the recommendations of the Amer ican Society of Echocardiography.  
Assessment of pulmonary artery pressure:  In the subcostal window, imaging of the inferior vena cava and 
hepatic veins will be performed and used to estimate RA diastolic pressures.  Pulmonary artery pressure will 
be calcu lated from the tricuspid regurgitation velocity and the estimated RA diastolic pressure.  
Ventricular structure:  Ventricular volumes (Systolic and Diastolic) will be assessed by [CONTACT_186664] 
(method of discs) analysis of LV volume obtained from two orth ogonal cuts of the LV (api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 4 and 2 chamber).  
Systolic function.  Ejection fraction (EF)  will be calculated from the M -mode measurements and from the 
volumes as calculated from the Biplane Simpsons analysis using the formula: EF (%) = 100 * (Diastolic 
Volume – Systolic Volume)/ Diastolic Volume  
Assessment of LV diastolic function and LV filling pressures.   Pulsed wave Doppler examination of mitral 
(before and with Valsalva maneuver) and pulmonary venous inflow as well as Doppler tissue imaging of the 
mitral annulus will be performed.  
 
Analytic methods  
Both plasma and urine concentration of Iothalmate will be determined by [CONTACT_186665]. Glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) will be calculated using Iothalmate clearance using the following equation:  
 
GFR (ml / min)  =     U   x   V              
                          P                                                            
[Where:    U = urine concentration; P = plasma concentration; V = urine flow (mL/ min)]  
Plasma and urine will be analyzed f or sodium with the Beckman ion -selective analyzer.  Urine creatinine will be 
measured by [CONTACT_186666].  Renal cGMP generation, will calculated as follows: {[urine 
cGMP * urine flow] – [plasma cGMP* GFR]}.  Venous blood for hormone analysi s will be collected in heparin 
and EDTA tubes and immediately placed on ice.  After centrifugation at 2,[ADDRESS_220563] Burnett’s laboratory,

 11 The overall risk  for participation in this protocol is small and the main concern is that the addition of 
Candesartan (AT 1 blocker) and or increasing the ACE inhibitor dose would result in hypotension, 
hyperkalemia, and increased plasma creatinine.  However, we demonstrated that acute AT1 receptor blockade 
prevented the detrimental renal hemodynamic effect s of furosemide with suppression of aldosterone. Previous 
studies have also established beneficial renal hemodynamic and excretory function of AT1 receptor blockade 
in experimental models of CHF. Vople et al demonstrated that [ADDRESS_220565] the risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia , and increased plasma creatinine, the 
following measure are incorporated in the protocol:  
 
 
• We will only include patients with compensated stable CHF as defined by; a) no change in NYHA 
symptoms over the past 3 months; b) on stable doses of ACE inhibitor,  beta blocker, digoxin and 
furosemide over the past 4 weeks ; c) no epi[INVESTIGATOR_186632] 6 months.  
Theis will minimize their risk of fluid retention and congestion.  
• We will exclude patients with prior diagnosis of intrinsic renal dise ases including renal artery stenosis of 
> 50%  
• We will exclude patients with Serum potassium of > 5. 7 mEq/dL

• Patients will have  blood draw n to measure plasma creatinine and potassium 7-10 days after every dose 
incre ase until target dose is achieved. Ther eafter, subjects will get blood draws every 4 weeks.  If there 
shoul d be a potassium result <3.5 or > 6.0,  subjects will need to have labs redraw n the same day.  
• Subjects will also have access to a [ADDRESS_220568] any questions or deve lop 
any side effects.  
• They will be instructed to measure the ir blood pressure weekly  and record it , along with heart rate and 
weight .  
• They will also receive a weekly phone call to review status.  
• During the study, if patient develops symptomatic hypotens ion as defined above or an increased of 
plasma creatinine of > 0.3 mg/dL or hyperkalemia > 5. 7 meq/ml, the dose will be reduced by 50%.  If 
those parameters persist, the dose will be decreased further by 50%.  At the discretion of the 
investigator, the med ication can be discontinued

parameters persist, the subject will be withdrawn fr om the study  
 
Other potential minor risk  includes:  
 
The risks of blood drawing in clude bleeding at the puncture site, bruising and pain. These risks occur in a very 
small portion of the population. We will exclude patients with hemoglobin of < 9 g/dl. The blood draw amount 
for this study is [ADDRESS_220570] agree to use a reliable double barrier method of contraception until study completion.  A double barrier 
method of contraception is considered to be a combination of TWO of the following: birth control

Iothalamate  contains a small amount of iodine and for persons allergic to iodine, this could pose a higher risk 
for an allergic reaction. To date in more than 5,[ADDRESS_220571] been only rare allergic reactions (one 
or two) when the solution has been used for this type of test. The amount of the material injected for this test 
will be approximately the same as used in a similar kidney function test performed on a routine basis 
(Approximately [ADDRESS_220572] per month) in the Renal Function Laboratory. However, patients with a history of an 
allergic reaction to iodine should not participate in this study.

Recruitment and informed consent  
Subjects will be recruited at the Mayo Clinic from the Heart Failure Clinic, Community Internal Medicine, 
General Internal Medicine , and past participants of [CONTACT_186672]’s studies . In addition, we also now have in place a 
new web -based patient identification sys tem developed at Mayo by [CONTACT_186667]. 
Upon identification of a subject, the study will be explained in detail by [CONTACT_186668] -ordinator, 
the consent form reviewed , questions answered , and the consent form signed.   
 
Potential benefits of the proposed research to the subjects and others  
Subjects participating in specific aims [ADDRESS_220573] 
(IRB).  Our plan includes the formation of an internal safety monitoring committee consisting of 2 cardiologists: 
Dr  and Dr , and one nephrologist, Dr. .  All adverse and serious 
adverse events occurring between consent and final study visit will be reported to the safety monitoring 
committee , NIH and our IRB.  Furthermore, the safety monitoring committee w ill review adverse events after 
[ADDRESS_220574] completed the protocol . The recommendations of the safety committee after each 
review will be submitted to the IRB. All serious adverse events will be reported as described below.  
 
 
 A plan for report ing Serious Adverse Events (SAE) to the IRB  
 
A Serious Adverse Event  is defined as an event with any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening adverse drug or device experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186634] n  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Unanticipated Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]):   
 Mayo Clinic's IRB and OHRP  defines unanticipated problem/event involving risk to subjects o r 
others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) as any problem or event that was 1) serious; 2) unanticipated; AND 3) at least 
possibly related to the research procedures.  

 13 Serious:  Serious problems/events can be well defined and include death; life threatening adverse 
experience; hosp italization: inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity: persistent or significant; 
birth defect/anomaly; and/or per protocol OR may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_186635], safety, o r welfare of the subjects or others, or 
substantially compromised the research data.  
Unanticipated:  (unexpected) problems/events are those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the consent form, not listed in the Investigator's Brochure, or not part of an underlying 
disease. A problem/event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. 
A problem/event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected.  
Related:  A problem/event is "related" if it is possibly, probably or definitely related to the research 
study

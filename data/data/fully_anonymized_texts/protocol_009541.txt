A. Specific Aims  - Alcohol Biosensor Monitoring for Alcohol  Related  Liver  Disease  
 Successful treatment of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) depends primarily on total abstinence from 
alcohol.  Patients are instructed  to maintain complete abstinence in order to have the best health outcomes 
and prevent ALD sequela or worsening of their liver  disease . Different than addiction treatment where 
abstinence or even harm reduction may be an eventual goal with less need for immediate adherence, the 
complete abstinence requirement in this patient population makes it a useful model in which to test new  
strategies for efficient monitoring of patient behavior. Currently monitoring of ALD patients’ alcohol use is 
primarily done through clinical interview and  conventional laboratory alcohol testing. Optimally patients would 
be interviewed frequently and  randomly tested, although in real world clinical settings  this is difficult to 
accomplish.  Continuous monitoring of alcohol use by [CONTACT_584630].  For ALD 
patients such devices could facilitate monitoring of alcohol abstinence providing both patients and clinicians 
with real -time information that may be critical for  develop ment  and adjust ment  alcohol treatment plans.   
 From our prior work  (K23 AA00257 and R01 DK066266) we determined that most discoveries of 
alcohol use  in ALD patients  are not made until months after th e initiati on of consumption and  were largely 
captured based on prospective repeated multi -method research measures not routinely employed in a clinical 
setting.  Continuous alcohol monitoring in the months following a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584613] .  Whether biosensor devices would facilitate 
identification  beyond self -reports , be integrated in to the clinical workflow, accepted by [CONTACT_445613], 
and improve outcomes requires investigation. Recent technology advancements expand continuous biosensor 
performance while reducing overall cost.  It could be assumed that monitoring with a bios ensor would be more 
convenient and more desirable , but there could be disadvantages.  Patients may feel uncomfortable using the 
device or feel it is an intr usion.  Clinicians may find additional data cumbersome or not useful to care delivery.   
 Therefore feasibility of integrating such technology into routine clinical care requires examining both 
patients’ and clinicians’ perceived potential benefits (e.g. , patient convenience , clinician confidence in data  and 
its value, potential improvement in care delivery , facilitation of develop ing/adjust ing treatment plans,  reduction 
in staff burden) and possible barriers (e.g. patient resistance to adoption, disruption of clinician workflow or 
established communication).   These process considerations are essential to guide the developmen t of a full 
scale trial and future translation into clinical practic e. Thus the convenience, feasibility and acce ptability of such 
devices require vetting by [CONTACT_584631]. Our  R21 proposal targets NIAAA PA 15-301 Alcohol 
Use Disorders: Behavioral Treatment, Services and Recovery Research soliciting  proposals for co-morbid 
medic al and alcohol use disorders , specifically proposals using technology  to develop and validate 
assessme nts capturing real -time data to  use in clinical treatment paradigms.   
 We propose a [ADDRESS_768720] pi[INVESTIGATOR_584614] (ABM)(WrisTAS -see methods) for 
patients  with a recent  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584615]. P atients who intend to stop drinking will 
wear the ABM and be randomized to receiv e ABM personalized feedback on the data retrieved from the device 
(ABM) vs. an enhanced usual care  group that will wear the ABM device but not receive information about 
device data (EUC).  Considering future translation into medical practice  we cho se a monthly  assessment 
schedule aligned with the  typi[INVESTIGATOR_584616] a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_584617]. The study will also include  
quantitative and qualitative data collected from participants and 15 clinical stakeholders (e.g. physicians, nurse 
practitioners, care coordinators ) who will provide opi[INVESTIGATOR_584618], acceptability,  feasibility , and 
potential to change clinical care and outcomes . Qualitative methods  are especially useful for understanding  
patient and clinician cultures and perspectives to determine the perceived needs,  barriers, and preferences for 
monitoring alcohol use and are essential  for future translation of this technology into clinical practice.   
     Specific Aim 1 . To determine usability, acceptability,  feasibility and efficiency of ABM for ALD patients . 
     Specific Aim 2.  To determine whether ABM plus feedback improves  outcomes for ALD patients who intend 
to stop alcohol use compared to EUC. Hypotheses 1 -5: ABM will 1) reduce alcohol use (primary outcome), and 
2) improve readiness for alcohol abstinence, 3 ) improve self -efficacy, 4) improve initiation of addiction 
treatment and 5) reduce ALD related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584619] (secondary outcomes).  
     Specific Aim [ADDRESS_768721] by 1) determining the potential  for and value  to 
ABM healthcare  integration  2) identifying barriers to ABM implementation 3) determining long term wearability 
of ABM devices and 4) determine whether identified patient outcome effect sizes appear clinically meaningful 
to justify ABM monitoring and evaluation in a full -scale random ized controlled trial in the clinical environment.  
 
D. Approach: Research Design and Methods  
 We address the NIH mandate for rigor and transparenc y (NOT -OD-16-011) in the proposal and Table1.  
Sample:  We have an ample study population . In the past 15 mo nths >600 ALD patients were treated at the 
UPMC Center for Liver Diseases (CLD) ; >130 discharged from an ALD decompensated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584620] ~30 mile s of our clinic.  Such patients require close CLD follow up for medical care, typi[INVESTIGATOR_584621] . Our center’s ALD population is comparable to regional and national data not only for gender 
and age, but race/ethnicity as well , aiding generalizability. We will recruit for 15 mo nths with planned 4 -5 
enrollees /month. We have had  good recruitment (<10% refusals) and retention (80 -90%) for prior ALD cohorts 
and Drs. Dunn and Jakicic have had >75% consistent wearing of biosensors in prior studies .47,54  If required to 
assure assessments’  completion we will ask participants to return for a study visit or make home visits.   
Recruitment:  Patient Participants -Patients followed at the CLD clinic who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584622] - 
pensated ALD will be approached for recruitment  before discharge.  
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_584623], liver disease diagnosis, and associated liver 
enzyme profile.[ADDRESS_768722] a histo ry of excessive alcohol 
consumption based on quantity/frequency/duration defined as > 40 
grams of ethanol per day for women or > [ADDRESS_768723] sustained sobriety (>3 months).   Diagnosis 
of decompensated ALD will be established by a CLD hepatologist 
as defined above .2-[ADDRESS_768724].  Clinician participants -15 CLD clinicians caring for ALD patient s will be  recruited to 
participate in Aim 3 qualitative and quantitative interviews.  Clinicians will be selected from a pool of 25 CLD 
hepatologists, certified clinical nurses, and nurse practitioners (ages 27 -70, all > 5 years practice, 50% female).  
 Screening:  Patients with ALD will be asked if they intend to stop drinking/remain abstinent and if so will 
be screened for recruitment. Patients will be screened using 7 items on the recognition subscale of the Stages 
of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerne ss Scale (SOCRATES  V.8)57 and the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MOCA)58 to screen for cognitive  impairment. Patients will be asked about current other drug use.   
 Inclusion:  > 18 years old, willing to accept randomization, and agree to wear device for 3 months. 
Consistent with findings from alcohol treatment seeking individuals in NIAAA’s Project MATCH59 we will enroll  
ALD patients with SOCRATES problem recognition sub scale score >26 (scores <26 indicate very low 
recognition). Maisto60 suggests individuals with low recognition in the face of secondary alcohol complications 
may have pathological denial or cognitive impairment and these individuals are unlikely to intend to stop use.  
 Exclusions:  Non-English 
speaking (<5%  CLD);  persisting 
encephalopathy, MOCA scores <21  
(moderate cognitive impairment ) or 
neurolo gic diseases (e.g. 
Parkinson’s ), conditions which w ould 
affect survey assessments;  patients 
with unresponsive acute alc oholic 
hepatitis, multi -organ failure, 
fulminant hepatic failure, or MELD 
score >2 1(all with 3-month mortality  
>20%),61,62 cancer /terminal illness, 
non-cirrhotic conditions ; those 
unable to wear a wri st monitor (e.g., 
edema ); and  those currently abusing 
drugs (checked by [CONTACT_584632]),  lacking a  residence, or 
unable to identify a contact [CONTACT_9702] (if 
lost to follow -up).

Table 2 .  STUDY PROCEDURES    
Recruitment, screening  
• Prior to  discharge from ALD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584624]  
• After CLD staff receive verbal consent, study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_584634] (SOCRATES 
recognition subscale >26). If subject meets screening criteria they will be consented and enrolled  
Randomization  and  baseline assessment  
•  Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 ratio ABM with feedback or EUC (permuted blocks to limit 
assignment imbalances across enrollment). All subjects wear ABM (WrisTAS)  
• Random assignment implemented using sequential, opaque, numbered envelopes opened by [CONTACT_584635]. Investigators/assessors blinded to allocation  
• Baseline assessments completed –Form90 AI, SOCRATES, AASE, AWR, DrInC, DPI  (Table 3) 
Monthly ABM feedback and EUC procedures  (see Appendix A) and data collection (Table 3)  
• ABM –receives monthly typi[INVESTIGATOR_584625], risk/referral information,  and patient brochures if alcohol use reported  
• EUC –(attention control) monthly typi[INVESTIGATOR_584626] -report 
alcohol questions, risk/referral information and patient brochure provided if alcohol use reported  
• Issues with comfort or adjustment of WrisTAS will be addressed

demonstrate the ABM device  and note it must be worn at all times. We will use a 2 -arm parallel groups design ; 
subjects randomi zed 1:1 to either receive personalized feedback on the ABM data  or receive enhanced usual 
care (EUC). The EUC  group will have ABM data down -loaded for alcohol outcomes assessment but will  not 
receive feedback on the data. At each of [ADDRESS_768726] 
medical questions (e.g. medications, symptoms).  In addition the ABM feedback group will receive 
personalized feedback on downloaded data includ ing graphical displays of alcohol use (Appendix A) . Our 
feedback script i s based on standard personalized feedback interventions using key elements : personalized 
alcohol use information, comparison to normative cohort, risks of use, and resources for help .52,63,[ADDRESS_768727] 
visit (and at subsequent visits if use continues)  both groups will receive information on negative health 
consequences, local alcohol addiction treatment referral information, and 2 NIAAA brochures on health 
consequences and treatment help (see scripted protocols Appendix A).  EUC is “enhanced” because beyond 
generic alcohol use questions scripted information on risks and resources is not commonly provided.  A 
research assistant blinded to assignment will perform outcome assess ments at baseline, 6 weeks and final 
interview. Final assessments include quantitative and qualitative questions on perceived usability and device 
satisfaction, acceptability, lifestyle compatibility, and feasibility of long term use. So as  not to pair par ticipant 
payment with intervention, the payment schedule aligns with assessments but includes compensation for 
wearing the device .  
For ultimate medical setting dissemination we use non-physician  personnel because  we see this as the 
future of such interven tions.  Medical technicians, increasing ly used to extend clinical staff, are ideal for 
feedback delivery. Our study uses medical technicians who will be assigned to only one arm of the study and 
separately trained to prevent cross -contamination.  Drs. DiMa rtini and Dew will train them on protocol delivery 
using lectures, role playing, audiotapi[INVESTIGATOR_584628]/printed 
materials provi ded to participants. During training we will elicit and address any challenges to the maintenance 
of fidelity.  Dr. DiMartini will assess  competence based on ratings following principles of treatment fidelity 
evaluation,65,66,67,[ADDRESS_768728] through the enrollment period, 
and adherence, competence and reliability will be rated.  For certification a  random 20% of audiotaped 
sessions will be reviewed with retraining for defi ciencies (see also DSMP 4.1.5.a Fidelity Development, 
Training, and Monitoring). Completed assessment and feedback sheets will be inspected for errors.  
Clinician participants:  At study completion 15 CLD clinicians will review de -identified ABM data from 
the study and be asked a range of quantitative/qualitative questions on feasibility, acceptability, usability , 
graphical display of data,  workflow integration , and potential health impacts  (Appendix B) and be paid.  
 
 
E. Analytic Plan  
 Specific Aims 1 & 3.  To determine usability, acceptability, feasibility and efficiency of ABM for patients 
and clinicians.  Qualitative data coding and analysis:   De-identified transcribed interviews will be thematically 
coded107 and a codebook developed for patients and clinicians. The constant comparison method will be used, 
and subsequent interviews may be modified/informed by [CONTACT_584636]. After initial consensus is  reached among two coders, interviews will be coded by 
[CONTACT_584637]. Coding discrepancies will be resolved through 
consensus.  Periodic interviews (expected rate, 1 in 8) will be coded by [CONTACT_584638] -coder reliability.  Further, interviews that have already been coded will be reviewed as more 
codes are identified. [CONTACT_584640] will monitor for coding drift by [CONTACT_584639]. earlier coded 
interviews. For SA1&[ADDRESS_768729] examine univariate 
distributions on baseline characteristics and on each outcome. We will examine the d ata for extent and pattern 
of missingness across outcome assessments. Potential violations of assumptions of planned parametric 
methods of analysis will be explored and resolved, e.g., variables will be transformed as needed; 
nonparametric methods will be employed if transformations are inadequate.  Baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics of the two study groups will be examined via x2 tests for categorical variables and t -tests for 
continuous variables (or Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests if necessary) in  order to (a) describe the sample and (b) 
evaluate whether the randomization process effectively balanced the groups.  If imbalances are observed, we 
may need to adjust (covary) for significant and/or large baseline differences in the evaluation of hypothe ses.  
 The primary outcome is alcohol use (H1), which we will test via 2 measures: % of days drinking; total 
quantity/frequency during period between downloads.  Secondary outcomes ( H2-4) are readiness for alcohol 
abstinence, self -efficacy, initiation with addiction treatment will be analyzed using SOCRATES subscales and 
AASE/AWR (continuous variables), H5 Form 90AF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_584629] (% of days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570838]. 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369644]+ER visits). For each primary/secondary outcome, we will use a linear mixed effects 
model with fixed effects for intervention group (2 groups) and the repeated measures factor, time (pre -
intervention, [ADDRESS_768730] -intervention); and ran dom effects for individual participant and 
intercept.  
 Statistical Power:  Ours is an exploratory study; the ESs we might observe are unknown. For the 
simple effects we will compute as described above, with [ADDRESS_768731] power at 80% to detect an ES, d >0.76. Brief feedback 
interventions can produce moderate to large ESs for reducing alcohol use and consequences (d of 0.6 -
0.8).81,[ADDRESS_768732] will be to examine 
feasibility issues and ESs as opposed to testing for statistical significance.

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Effects of Exercise on Glymphatic Functioning and Neurobehavioral 
Correlates in Parkinson’s Disease  
  
Study Des cription : This study will  assess  patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s 
disease  (PD) over prior and following participation in a  12-week 
community -based exercise program , assessing neuroimaging ( beta -
amyloid deposition, glymphatic flow), and clinical severity  (motor, 
cognitive, sleep disturbance , mood ). 
  
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective :  
Evaluate the glymphatic functioning and beta -amyloid burden response to 
12 weeks of a community -based exercise course in PD patients . 
 Secondary Objectives :  
Quantify the association between glymphatic functioning, beta -amyloid 
burden, and neurobehavioral dysfunction in PD . 
Evaluate the degree to which neuroimaging- based response to exercise 
mediates  clinical  improvement in PD. 
Tertiary Objectives:  
 Evaluate whether the association between glymphatic functioning, beta -
amyloid burden, and neurobehavioral dysfunction in PD  differs between 
cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired PD phenotypes.  
Evaluate whether the  neuroimaging and clinical response to exercise 
differs between cognitively healthy and cognitively impaired PD 
phenotypes . 
Quaternary Objectives:  
Develop a normative reference group for the Brief Estimate  of Seconds 
Test (BEST) to facilitate PD score interpretation and establish how PD -
related neurodegeneration affects time perception. In addition, determine how BEST scores correlate with disease severity, neuroanatomical ROIs, and neuropsychometric cognit ive data collected in the previous objectives.

2 STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 For the PD cohort, p articipants will be recruited from Vanderbilt University Medical Center Neurology’s 
Behavioral and Cognitive and Movement Disorder Clinics by [CONTACT_6283]. Claassen and Considine. We will 
prospectively enroll participants with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (n= 50; age range=55 -80 years), 
equally distributed and matched for age and sex between groups with (n= 25) and without (n= 25) mild 
 
  [ADDRESS_758653] medical and motor presentation 
indicated for the community -based exercise program. Those patients with clinically -defined MCI, will be 
without evidence of vascular cognitive impairment, primary mood disorder, or comorbid med ical 
condition that could contri bute to cognitive symptoms (e.g. pulmonary, hematologic, metabolic, or 
vitamin deficiency).  Potential participants will undergo a neurological and neuropsychological 
examination  (including cognitive exam and behavioral/symptom questionnaires)  to characterize their 
medical and neurobehavioral status. They will then undergo baseline neuroimaging protocols, both MRI 
brain scan (DTI- ALPS) and PET/CT  (C11PiB  ) brain scan. Actigraph will be attached to the patient to 
continuously monitor motor activity. A background monitor of typi[INVESTIGATOR_577611]. The cohort will complete the same clinical and 
neuroimaging assessments after they participate in a 12-week  community -based exercise intervention. 
Specifics about assessments and the exercise program are as follows.  
 For the healthy cohort, participants will be recruited from the general population and a database of individuals who have elected to be contact[CONTACT_577618] a contact [CONTACT_982]. They will be adults between the ages of 18 and  90 without neurological or psychiatric pathology (N 
= 75). Under the supervision of the clinical coordinator, the participants will be asked to complete the Brief Estimate  of Seconds Task (BEST) in person or via Microsoft Teams. These data will aid in the  creation 
of a normative reference group for the BEST, dependent on sex and age. Using data collected in both the PD and healthy cohorts, we will perform subsequent analyses to determine the relationship between PD BEST scores and clinical disease severity (UPDRS), neuroanatomical ROIs, and stand ard 
neuropsychometric cognitive measures. These findings will elucidate the origins and extent of time 
perception changes in PD  
 
2.2 STUDY DESIGN SPECIFICS  
 
Clinical Assessments  
 
PD cohort  
All potential participants will undergo neurological  and neuropsychological examination to determine 
eligibility, categorize MCI status, and provide quantification of neurocognitive functioning and 
neuropsychiatric symptomatology.   
 Screening data  (see inclusion/exclusion criteria)  from eligible enrollees will be also used as part of 
clinical baseline assessment.   
 Neurological examination will include the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale  III (UPDRS -III)
56 and 
the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)57 scale. Vitals and a blood sample  (10mL)  will be collected as part of 
this examination.  Medical history will include an inquiry as to whether the participant is actively dieting.  
 
The neuropsychological examination protocol will consist of a memory measure (i.e., the Hopkins Verbal 
Learning Test – Revised [HVLT -R]58, consisting of Learning, Recall, and Recognition subcomponents) , 
executive functioning measures (i.e., Trail Making Test – A & B59, Verbal Fluency [FAS]60, Stroop61), and 
exploratory measures of cognitive -performance thought potentially sensitive to PD -related pathology 
(Brief Estimate of Seconds Test [BEST]62, Simon Task63). To evaluate sleep disturbance symptomatology, 
 
  8 PROMIS – Sleep Disturbance (SD) and Sleep -related Impairment (SRI) short forms will be administered64. 
To evaluate mood symptomatology, the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS)[ADDRESS_758654] visit of the community -based exercise 
program, including  rating/timing of ability to complete simple posture and gait tasks, as well as self-
reported difficulty with gait initiation.  UPDRS -III will also be administered at screening (on -drug), 
baseline assessment (off- drug), and follow -up assessment (off -drug)  Additionally, between enrollment 
and com petition, the patients will wear an actigraph to continuously measure motor activity.  
 
Healthy cohort:  
All participants will be administered the Brief Estimate of Seconds Test (BEST) in person or via Microsoft 
Teams.  
 
Imaging  
 
PD cohort  
MRI. Participants will begin with MRI in the morning after their 16 -hour dopaminergic washout the 
night/evening prior. Self- reported total sleep time the night prior will be recorded. They will be free to 
re-initiate therapy after MRI is complete.  The following imaging and angiography sequences will be 
completed. We will apply our previously -reported 3T methods (16 -channel neurovascular coil) with the 
below 50 min protocol:  
 
 A
natomical imaging. T 1-weighted (MPRAGE; spatial resolution=1.0x1.0x1.0mm3; 3D turbo -gradient -
echo; TR/TE=8.2/3.7ms), and T 2-weighted (FLAIR; spatial resolution=0.9x1.1x3.0mm3; turbo -inversion -
recovery; TR/TI/TE=[ZIP_CODE]/2800/120ms) imaging, and intracranial (spatial resolution = 0.5x0.8x1.4mm
3; 3D gradient echo; TR/TE=23/3.5ms) and extracranial (spatial 
resolution=0.9x0.9x3.0mm3; 2D gradient echo; TR/TE=18.6/3.2ms) time -of-flight (TOF) MR 
angiography (MRA).  
 Microvascular hemodynamic compliance. A single -shot gradient echo echo -planar -imaging (EPI) scan 
(TE=30 ms), multiband- factor=3, isotropic spatial resolution=2 mm, SENSE -factor=2.5, and TR=1s will 
be acquired with whole -brain coverage. The scan will utiliz e a hypercapnic normoxic (5% CO 2 / 21% O 2 
/ 74% N 2) stimulus. The stimulus will be administered through a tight -fitting non -rebreathing oxygen 
facemask from compressed gas cylinders (flow rate=12 L/min) with the following paradigm:  180s 
normocapnic normox ia / 90s hypercapnia repeated once, followed by 180s normocapnic normoxia. 
Heart and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], EtCO 2, and FiO 2 will be recorded.  
 CSF flow. 2D -Qflow measurements will be performed in the cerebral aqueduct (Fig. 7). V enc=12 cm/s, 
spatial resolution = 0.5x0.5x4 mm3, field -of-view = 200x200x4 mm3, and 30 frames per heart cycle. 
Scan durations vary with heart rate, but are generally 2 -4 min. Reproducibility has been determined 
by [CONTACT_577619] (Fig. 7). Background correction will be performed 
with a method previous ly developed for quantification of blood flow velocity in small perforating 
arteries4.  
 Lymphangiography for lymph vessel visualization. 3D turbo -spin-echo with variable refocusing angle 
sweep=40 -110°, driven equilibrium module, dynamic DANTE flip angle sweep=0 –8°, 
TE=600/TR=2500ms, slices=80, spatial resolution=1x1x1mm3. We have shown that this method 
provides sensitivity to long T [ADDRESS_758655] evaluated this method 
for sensitivity to lateralizing lymphedema and MLD therapy26 (Figs. 3,4).

Brief Title:  IV Acetaminophen for Postoperative Pain After Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair  
         Protocol Date:  2/20/18  
 
BACKGROUND  
POP is common with approximately 200,000 inpatient surgical  procedures performed each year to treat this 
condition.1 Older women tend to seek care more often than their younger counterparts, and it is estimated that 
women 70 -79 generate 10 times more consults per 1000 woman years compared to younger women. 2 This is 
particularly relevant since the world population is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_357192], with 27% of the populati on estimated to be >60 
years of age, with women representing 55% of the population  by [CONTACT_2892] 2050.[ADDRESS_445585] practices; however, these narcotics pose a risk of 
constipation, nausea, urinary retention, sedation and mild cognitive impairment that can be espe cially 
problematic in an elderly population.[ADDRESS_445586] this hypothesis, we propose a double -blind 
randomized controlled trial of IV acetaminophen  compared to placebo with the following  aims:  
 
Aim 1: Quantify the impact of IV acetaminophen  on 1a) postoperative pain scores and 1b) analgesic 
requirements.  1a)  To achieve this aim, we will measure the degree of postoperative pain using visual analog 
scales (VAS) at specified time points throughout the postoperative period , and compare results between IV 
acetaminophen  and placebo groups. 1b) We will use equianalg esic dosage tables to convert intra - and 
postoperative narcotics into morphine equivalents to compare narcotic requirements for the first week  after 
surgery. We hypothesize  that those patients receiving preemptive IV acetaminophen  will have lower 
postopera tive VAS scores and reduced narcotic requirements  compared to placebo .   
 
Aim 2: Determine the effect of IV acetaminophen  on patient satisfaction, mood, and interference with 
activities. To determine the impact of pain control on p atient centered outcomes such as satisfaction, mood,  
and mobility, subjects  will be asked to complete the American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire 
(APS -POQ -R) on postoperative day (POD) #1. Interference of pain with physical, mental and social activities 
will be measure d by [CONTACT_357209] s Measures Information Systems -Pain Interference –Short 
Form 8a (PROMIS PI -SF-8a) completed on POD#7. We hypothesize that women receiving preemptive IV 
acetaminophen  will have improved patient satisfaction, mood, and quicker  return to activities as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_357210] -POQ -R and PROMIS PI-SF-8a scores compared to placebo.  
 
Aim 3: Compare side effects of IV acetaminophen  and placebo.   We will assess postoperative nausea, 
pruritus, dizziness and drowsiness using  the APS -POQ -R questionnaire.  We will assess constipation and time 
to first bowel movement with postoperative bowel diaries.  We hypothesize  that all of these side effects will be 
reduced or eliminated in those patients receiving preemptive IV acetaminophen  compared to  placebo due to a 
reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_357193].    
RESEARCH STRATEGY  
Significance  
This research is significant since  preemptive IV acetaminophen  may demonstrate improved postoperative pain 
and quality of life (QOL) in patients undergoing POP surgery compared placebo.  If efficacy is demonstrated in 
women undergoing repair of POP, this will lead to improved implementation of IV acetaminophen  as 
preemptive analgesia in this population of elderly women who are particula rly susceptible to the side effects of 
narcotic pain medications.  Additionally, if preemptive analgesia with IV acetaminophen  is effective in reducing 
postoperative narcotic use, this may lead to a reduction in side effects commonly seen with narcotics in cluding 
nausea, pruritus, cognitive impairment, and constipation.  Reducing  these side effects may lead to increased 
patient satisfaction, faster postoperative recovery and expedited hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
 
Innovation  
Although IV acetaminophen  has shown effic acy as postoperative analgesia, studies on its use as preemptive 
analgesia are lacking.  Previous studies of preemptive analgesia with IV acetaminophen  in Turkish and South 
Korean women undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy have been of low methodologica l quality and have 
shown conflicting results in reduction of postoperative VAS pain scores.10-[ADDRESS_445587] been lacking in prior studies of preemptive IV acetaminophen . If found to be effective in reducing 
postoperative pain and improving patients satisfaction, preemptive IV acetaminophen  may become part of 
routine preoperative care for patients undergoing POP surgery.  
 
APPROACH 
Overview:  This randomized double -blind placebo controlled multi -center trial will determine the efficacy of 
preemptive IV acetaminophen  in reducing postoperative pain scores and narcotic requirements in women 
undergoing surgical repair of POP.  
 
Setting: This s tudy will be conducted at Magee Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (MWH)  of the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_357194] (UPMC) , UPMC Passavant, Hamot Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_809], West Penn Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357195] (AHN), and Jefferson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357196] . Subj ects will be recruited from multiple clinic sites 
throughout the UPMC and AHN networks.  These are  high-volume referral center where women with POP are 
treated with  surgical and non -surgical options .. 
 
Recruitment:  Women will be recruited from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357197], 
UPMC Hamot, UPMC Passavant, Jefferson Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357198] .  All potential participants for this 
study will be identified through standard clinical visits (either at initial consultation, follow -up, or preoperative 
appointment). As is our current standard of care, all new patients undergo a comprehens ive history and 
physical exam.  If a woman has prolapse and is considering surgical repair, she may be eligible for the study. 
The study will be intr oduced by [CONTACT_102]’s physician.  If the patient would like to discuss the study further, 
she will be approached by a member of the study team to be screened. If she meets inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, she will be offered participation and info rmed conse nt will be obtained.   
 
Study eligibility  
Inclusion Criteria: Women ≥ 18 years of age scheduled to undergo surgery for POP  via a vaginal or minimally 
invasive (laparoscopic/robotic) route and anticipated to  have a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] ≥[ADDRESS_445588] be able to speak and read English.   
Exclusion Criteria:   Women with (1) an allergy/intolerance to acetaminophen , (2) hepatic dysfunction,  or (3) 
significant alcohol use – defined as patient reported consumption of more than [ADDRESS_445589] dri nks per week 
and/or 3 drinks per day , will be excluded.  
 
Data collectio n 
Baseline assessment: (Table 1). The baseline visit will occur on t he same day of enrollment. If the patient 
meets inclusion /exclusion  criteria and consents to enrollment, baseline information will be obtained including 
age, race/ethnicity, general medical histo ry, parity, tobacco use, prior hormone replacement therapy use , and 
baseline VAS pain score. Objective measurements including he ight, weight, BMI , and prolapse stage will be 
collected from the electronic medical record (EMR). Intraoperati ve data from the EMR will include surgical 
route (vaginal vs laparoscopic/robotic), concomitant proced ures, estimated blood loss , and operative ti me.

Intervention: Study drug and placebo will be prepared by [CONTACT_357211] 250cc glass bottles. Each bottle will contain either acetaminophen  100 mL or sodium 
chloride 0.9% 100 mL. Preoperative nurses will administer the study medication (either 100 cc of 
acetaminophen (1000mg/100mL) or  100 cc of normal saline ) intravenously  10-30 minutes prior to anesthesia 
induction in the preoperative area on the day of surger y. The administer ed medication  will be recorded in the 
EMR as “investigational drug” so that blinding will be maintained . Participants will be randomly allocated in a 
1:1 ratio using computer -generated fixed blocks of four, stratified by [CONTACT_357212] (vaginal vs 
laparosc opic/robotic). Allocation concealment will be maintained by [CONTACT_357213]/placebo. The investigators, surgical team, anesthesia team, and nursing 
staff will be blinded to the randomization s equence.  Patients will be randomized in the preoperative area on 
the day of surgery to prevent randomization of patients who may go on to cancel or postpone surgery.  The 
UPMC Magee Investigational Drug service will maintain the randomization sequence.  P harmacists at 
Passavant, Hamot, West Penn and Jefferson will contact [CONTACT_357214].  
 
Follow-up:  Subjects will be followed for a total of 7 days (Table 1) . Postoperatively, subjects will be asked to 
mark their pain on a VAS scale administered every [ADDRESS_445590] the 
time and dosage of all pain  medications used (narcotic and non -narcotic)  and time and date of all  bowel 
movement s. They will be asked to mail this questionnaire back to the office in a self -addressed stamped 
envelope.  Participants will also be asked to complete the PROMIS PI -SF 8a q uestionnaire on POD#7. Based 
on participant preference, paper or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_357199]. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_357200] -addressed stamped envelopes.  Electronic access will be granted through the NIH 
PROMIS Ass essment Center  via a secure link emailed to participants interested in electronic completion . All 
patients will be called and reminded to fill out this survey [ADDRESS_445591] -operatively by [CONTACT_3647].  
Specifically, readmissions or telephone calls to the office for poor pain control or constipation will be extracted.   
Of note, the study coordinators at AHN and UPMC will ensure proper data collection and will be in charge of 
data extraction at their respective sites.  
 
Variables and measures  
Postoperative pain  
Visual Analog Scale ( VAS) pain: The primary outcome for thi s study is pain at 24 hours postoperatively. Pain 
will be measured every four hours following surgery (4, 8,  12, 16, 20, and 24 hours) by [CONTACT_357215]. VAS 
pain scales are unidimensional measures of pain intensity that are easily completed and scored.[ADDRESS_445592] an “X” on a 10 c entimeter (c m) VAS line at the point that re presents their pain intensity. The score is 
calculated by [CONTACT_357216]  (mm)  along the 10 cm line where 0 represents “no pain” 
and 10 represents “worst pain .” Scores range from [ADDRESS_445593] been used to measure postoperative pain in many prior 
studies of IV acetaminophen .8 VAS pain scores will be used as the primary outcome me asure in this study 
because they are easy to complete, which is essential in a predominantly elderly population, and because they 
are easily compared to prior studies of preemptive IV acetaminophen .  
Narcotic  requirements  
Morphine equivalents:  Doses of n arcotic pain medications administered to subjects during the intra - and 
postoperative period will be abstracted from the EMR .  Narcotics will be converted to morphine equivalents, in 
grams,  using an equi analgesic dosage table.[ADDRESS_445594] been widely 
used in the study of postoperative pain and specifically those investigating the efficacy of preemptive and 
postop erative IV acetaminophen .8,10,11  
 
Patient satisfaction and mood  
APS-POQ -R: The APS -POQ -R is a validated questionnaire used to assess QOL  and satisfaction with pain 
control over the [ADDRESS_445595] of pain on mood and emotional well -being. It contains twelve items across six 
subscales: pain  severity and relief, impact of pain on mood/emotions, adverse effects, satisfaction, 
participation in decision making, and non -pharmacological methods of pain management.[ADDRESS_445596] of pain on satisfaction (item 9), moo d/emotions (item 5 a -d) and adverse effects  (item 6 
a-d, see below). These su bscales use a 0 -10 rating scale. This measure has good internal consistency 
(alpha=0.85) and validity.  
 
Pain interference  
PROMIS PI-SF-8a: This questionnaire is a short form o f the PROMIS PI [INVESTIGATOR_357201], designed to assess the 
interference of pain on an individual’s physical, mental and social activities. It is a patient reported outcomes 
measure and is validated for both computer and paper administration by [CONTACT_18121]. Specifically , it queries the 
interference of pain over the last week across 8 items.  It has shown excellent reliability (alpha=0.90 -0.95) and 
validity.15 Based on participant preference, paper or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_357199]. 
Electronic ac cess will be granted through the NIH PROMIS Assessment Center, with questionnaires emailed to 
participants via a secure link.  
 
Side effects  
APS-POQ -R: The APS -POQ -R questionnaire contains four items on the side effects  of pain medication 
including nausea, drowsiness , itchiness and dizziness (Item s 6a-d). Respondents use a rating scale [ADDRESS_445597].  Psychometric properties of this questionnaire are discussed above.   
 
Bowel diaries:  Because the APS -POQ -R questionnaire do es not query constipation, patients will be asked to 
provide the date/time of all bowel movement s during the first postoperative week .  Validated measures of 
constipation are complicated by [CONTACT_357217] .16 Therefore, we chose 
to survey constipation through the use of a self -reported bowel diary through POD#7.  
 
Data management plan  
After informed consent is signed, de -identified demographic and objective data from the baseline visit will be 
abstracted from t he EMR  into an excel file which  will transferred  into a SPSS (Armonk, NY ) document for 
analysis. Data exchange between AHN and UPMC will be done through secure password protected servers.  
No protected health information will be exchanged between the two s ites. The APS -POQ -R questionnaire will 
be administered on paper . Based on participant preference, paper or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_357202]-SF-
8a questionnaire will be provided. Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_357203] . All files will be stored on a password pro tected network 
drive within the health system firewalls .  Security will be maintained by [CONTACT_357218]. Data security will be monitored at weekly  research meetings.  
 
Data analysis  
Aim 1: Quantify the impact of IV acetaminophen  on 1a) postoperative pain scores and 1b) analgesic 
requirements . The primary outcome is VAS pain score at 24 hours. VAS scores will be measured on a scale 
of 0-100mm with higher scores indicating worse pain. Linear mixed models will be used to compare pain 
scores at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours postoperatively between IV acetaminophen  and placebo 
groups . Patient effects will be treated as random with fixe d effects for group, time and group*time.  Narcotic 
requirements measured in morphine equivalent grams will be compared by T -tests (and Wilcoxon rank -sum 
tests if non -parametric). Since route of surgery likely contributes to the amount of postoperative pain , we plan 
to stratify our analysis by [CONTACT_357219]/robotic surgery.  Both VAS pain scores and narcotic 
requirements will be compared in an intention to treat analysis. Heterogeneity of treatment effects will be 
analyzed by  [CONTACT_357220] m enopausal st atus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis will be used to 
identify independent risk factors that predict pain at [ADDRESS_445598] postoperative 
pain through alteration of the pain response or differences in pain medication metaboli sm. For this re ason, we 
plan to explore whether age moderates postoperative VAS scores.   
  
Aim 2: Determine the effect of IV acetaminophen  on patient satisfaction, mood, and interference with  
activities. T-tests (and Wilcoxon rank -sum tests if non -parametric) will be us ed to analyze results of APS -
POQ -R rating scales  and PROMIS PI -SF-8a scores. Individual analysis of  APS-POQ -R questionnaire items [ADDRESS_445599] of IV acetaminophen on mood  and satisfaction respectively.  
 
Aim 3: Compare side effects of IV acetaminophen  and placebo.   The severity of individual side effects 
(nausea, drowsiness, itchiness,  and dizziness), as measured by [CONTACT_195052] -POQ -R adverse effects subscale  
(items 6a -d), will be compared between IV acetaminop hen and placebo groups using T -tests (and Wilcoxon 
rank-sum tests if non -parametric).  Linear regression analysis is planned to quantify the effect of narcotics 
(measured in morphine equivalent grams) on side effect severity.  Constipation, measured in time (hours ) 
since surgery to first bowel movement, will be compared between the groups and will be included in the 
multivariable regression model to determine the effect of narcotics on constipation.  
 
Sample size and power analyses  
There is a paucity of info rmation on mean VAS scores on POD#1  following gynecologic surgery. Mean ± 
standard deviation [ADDRESS_445600] been published (44.0 ± 
20.8mm).18 VAS pain scores at 24 hours following vaginal prolapse repair a re also  available (19.3±14.8mm).19  
Previous studies of adult emergency department patients demonstrate a minimally clinically significant 
difference (MCSD) in VAS pain scores  of 9mm, 12mm, and [ADDRESS_445601] a difference in VAS pai n scores in women undergoing both 
vaginal and laparoscopic/robotic surgery, we performed separate sample size analyses using the larger of the 
two standard deviations (20.8mm) from previously published studies of robotic and vaginal surgery.18,19  
Assuming a two -sided alpha of 0.05, 96 women in each group would provide 80% power to detect a clinically 
significant differen ce in VAS scores after surgery in  those receiving  IV acetaminophen compared to placebo. 
After adjusting for a 5% loss to follow -up rate, we  would need to randomize 102 women undergoing 
laparoscopic/robotic surgery and 102 undergoing vaginal surgery for a total of 204 subjects.  
 
Potential issues and solutions  
Patients that do not undergo  surgery after enrollment:  To prevent non -adherence to th e study intervention, we 
will not randomize subjects until the day of surgery in the preoperative area. Once randomized, all participants 
will be followed and analyzed in  an intention to treat analysis . Subjects who are lost prior to randomization, for 
example those that cancel surgery or are not medically cleared will be excluded from analysis.  
 
Competing events : We plan to exclude  those women with severe dementia that will be unable to accurately 
compl ete study questionnaires/VAS pain scores.  Because patients with terminal diseases or those expected 
to have poor follow -up do not usually receive elective POP  surgery, these events should not occur in a high 
percentage of subjects, if at all.   
 
Missing d ata: Subjects with missing VAS pain scores or those that do not complete/return questionnaires and 
diaries  will still be included in the final analysis . To reduce the chance of missing data, members of the study 
team will call subjects or personally visit them in their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357204] -POQ -R questionnaires. Study nurses will call the patient at 1 week to remind them to 
complete and return their PROMIS PI-SF 8a questionnaire , pain diary  and bowel di ary. We will also emphasize 
the importance of the data and need for completeness with subje cts at the time of enrollment. We will account 
for missing data at the onset of the study by [CONTACT_357221] 5%. By [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_357205] (limi ted short forms with study participation ending on POD#7 ), we will not overburden the subjects.  
 
Adverse events:  We will proactively monitor for allergic reaction to IV acetaminophen and hepatotoxicity 
throughout the first 24 hours following surgery. Hosp ital readmission will be proactively monitored through 
POD#7. Because postoperative pain medications containing acetaminophen are routinely given following 
surgery, we will audit the EMR  on POD#1  to ensure that the maximum dose of acetaminophen  (4000 mg) has 
not been exceeded in the [ADDRESS_445602] dose of IV acetaminophen  
is 1000 mg, acetaminophen  containing medications will not be given to any participant (regardless of 
intervention group) within the first 6 hours o f surgery. This will appear as an alert in the patient chart to ensure 
that the pharmacy doe s not dose acetaminophen  containing medications during this window.   
 
Alternative strategies  
We initially considered comparing preemptive IV acetaminophen to ‘usual care’ rather than placebo. However, 
IV acetaminophen is occasionally administered intraoperatively by [CONTACT_357222], and due to 
concerns for acetaminophen overdose, this medi cation would have to be prohibited.  We also considered an 
unblinded study without a placebo -controlled group in order to avoid the investigational drug costs associated 
with assembly of the identical appearing intervention/placebo bottles.  However, lack of blinding may bias 
patient reported pain scores and/or physician prescribing of narcotics.    
 
Benchmarks for success  
Project benchmarks of success will include: (1) achievement of overall subject accrual goals; (2) attainment of 
primary outcome for all  subjects (VAS pain scores and narcotic requirements); (3) high -profile presentations 
and papers; (4) achievement of short -term career objectives; (5) implementation of clinical intervention as 
standard of care (if found to be effective).  
 
Feasibility dat a 
The Magee Womens Center for Bladder and Pelvic Health  is a large referral center with  five urogynecologists 
and two urologists specializing in female pelvic medicine.  The Allegheny Health Network is a large referral 
center with three urogynecologists. Th erefore , attaining a sample size of [ADDRESS_445603] not made 
our inclusion/ exclusion criteria overly -strict to enhance our ability to recruit subjects.  
 
Time table and plan for complet ing project in established timeframe  
This study is anticipated to be concluded by [CONTACT_357223] -year award period (Table 2).  After a short 
period of research staff training, we anticipate that recruitment of the [ADDRESS_445604] quarter of year one.  The 4th quarter of year one will be reserved for data analysis and manuscript 
drafting.  We aim to submit the manuscript for presentation at the 201 7 American Urogynecologic Society 
(AUGS) meeting.

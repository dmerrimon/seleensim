 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Identification of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Shedding in the 
Female  Genital Tract of Pregnant and Nonpregnant Women by 
[CONTACT_466567] 1/2 Assay , Routine PCR, and Culture  
Phase:  N/A (Device Trial)  
Population:  Group 1:  nonpregnant women in Sexually Transmitted 
Infections (STI) Clinics with clinically -apparent HSV lesions ; and 
Group 2:  pregnant women admitted with the intent of delivery 
with no visible evidence of HSV infection  
Number of Sites:  15 (listed in Section 1)  
Study Duration:  [ADDRESS_598319] Participation 
Duration:  1 day for Group 1 ( nonpregnant women ); 30-90 days for  Group 
2 (asymptomatic pregnant women ) 
Objectives : 
  
Primary:  
• To estimate  the sensitivity of the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay  
relative to culture for detecting herpes simplex virus (HSV) 
DNA in the genital tract of nonpregnant women in sexually 
transmitted infections (STI) clinics  
• To estimate the positive percent agreement and negative 
percent agreement  of the Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598320] of 
pregnant women admitted with the intent of delivery  
Seconda ry: 
• To estimate the positive predictive value of the Xpert HSV 
1/[ADDRESS_598321] of nonpregnant women in STI clinics  
• To estimate the positive percent agreement of the Xpert 
HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598322] of nonpregnant women in STI clinics  
• To compare the performance of Xpert with routine PCR in 
the combined group (pregnant and non -pregnant women) in 
detecting HSV -1 and HSV -2 virus, separately  
• To quanti fy HSV viral load , as determined by [CONTACT_466568],  
in the genital tract of women shedding the virus  
• To assess the type o f infection (first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_466540], first -
epi[INVESTIGATOR_466541] -primary, recurrent) among women shedding

 HSV 
Exploratory:  
• To determine rates of neonatal HS V disease among 
neonates delivered to pregnant women without active 
genital HSV lesions  
• To assess likelihood of viral transmission to neonates 
exposed to HSV during delivery as a manifestation of 
mode of delivery  
Description of Study 
Design:  The natural h istory of genital HSV shedding from the genital 
tract of pregnant and non -pregnant women will be evaluated, 
and the utility of a new cartridge -based PCR platform (the 
GeneXpert system with the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay cartridge) for 
detection of HSV -1 or HSV -2 will be assessed.  Two groups of 
women will be studied:  1) Group 1 consists of non -pregnant 
women who present at an STI clinic (likely at one or two study 
centers) with clinically evident HSV lesions; and 2) Group 2 
consists of pregnant women presenting with the intent to deliver 
with no evidence of HSV lesions (at all study centers).  
For Group 1 (n=300), viral shedding will be assessed by [CONTACT_466569], followed by [CONTACT_466570] -1 and HSV -2 
DNA by [CONTACT_466571] (routine PCR and the Xpert  HSV 1/2 
PCR using the GeneXpert platform).  PCR detection will be 
completed in batches and not in real time.  Results from the 
GeneXpert system (Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR) will be compared 
against results from HSV viral cultures and routine PCR.  
For Group 2 (n=12 ,500), viral shedding will be assessed by [CONTACT_466572] (routine PCR and Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR).  
Approximately half of the women in Group 2 will be tested by 
[CONTACT_466573]  1/2 PCR ; specimens from the 
rest of the women in Group 2 will be  stored for possible testing 
in the future by [CONTACT_466574]  1/2 PCR.  In 
this manner, we will maximize the data from which to compare 
Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR results with routine PCR, while maintaining 
flexibility to ensure an adequate number of specimens  are 
positive for HSV  DNA by [CONTACT_466568] . 
All Xpert and routine PCR  testing  will be performed at the UAB 
Central Laboratory.

 antibodies will be obtained on Study Day 1 from all women in 
both groups (Group 1 and Group 2).  If  she is determined to be 
shedding HSV  in the genital tract (using any of the three viral 
methods), then type -specific serologic testing will be performed.  
Correlation of viral typi[INVESTIGATOR_466542] -1 
and HSV -2 serostatus will allow for categorization of infection 
(first-epi[INVESTIGATOR_466540], first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_466543], or recurrent 
infection).  
HSV culture results from women in Group [ADDRESS_598323] or her 
physician  are two -fold:  1) the PCR analyses are performed in 
batches, so no results will be available within a tim eframe in 
which clinical decisions on the woman’s care could be made; 
and 2)  routine HSV PCR and Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598324] result is not known .  Even if PCR results (rou tine 
HSV PCR or Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay) could be obtained in a real-
time (non-batched) fashion, it would be irresponsible to report 
results from a non -validated test to the subject and her health 
care provider, as they may be influenced to make clinical 
decis ions based on this unvalidated information. Furthermore, 
using the results of this research test for clinical decision making 
is not the intent of this study protocol.   All pregnant women in 
Group [ADDRESS_598325] 
60,000 women conducted over a 20 year period, this group of 
research ers has reported an incidence rate for neonatal HSV 
disease of 1 in 3,200 live births.

Collaborative Antiviral Study Group  DMID Protocol #[ADDRESS_598347] thirty years in the treatment of neonatal HSV disease, 
significant numbers of babies die or are left with lifelong neurologic sequelae.  Since the 1970s, 
the N ational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Collaborative Antiviral Study 
Group ( CASG ) has completed a series of antiviral treatment studies in neonates with HSV 
infection.  The first two of these trials involved vidarabine.2,[ADDRESS_598348] of care for the 
management  of babies with neonatal herpes, and decreased mortality from disseminated 
neonatal herpes from over 80% in the pre -antiviral era to 30% with high dose acyclovir 
therapy.2,5,[ADDRESS_598349] of care and simultaneously provided paradigm -shifting insights into the 
natural history of HSV infec tions of the central nervous system (CNS).7  In these suppression 
studies, babies wi th neonatal HSV CNS disease had significantly improved neurodevelopmental 
outcomes when immediately started on active antiviral suppression following acute disease 
compared with babies in whom oral antiviral suppression was deferred until after skin 
recurr ences occurred or who only received placebo suppressive therapy.  These data indicate 
that subclinical viral replication with concomitant ongoing neurologic damage occurs during and 
following neonatal HSV CNS disease.  Even with immediate antiviral suppres sion, though, 
approximately three  in 10 survivors of neonatal HSV CNS disease develop significant 
neurologic sequelae.7  Each year in the [LOCATION_002], over 100 babies die from neonatal 
herpes, and 250 survivors are left with significant neurologic damage.1,5,7 -9  Approximately 1,000 
more survive without neurologic impairment, yet still require two to three weeks of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466547], which puts significant emotional stress

7 effort between NIAID and GlaxoSmithKline ( [COMPANY_004] ), enrolled 8,323 women age 18 -30 years at 50 
study sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada and was conducted from 2002 to 2010.  Overall , 
the vaccine was not efficacious; vaccine efficacy was 20% (95% confidenc e interval [CI], −29 to 
50) against genital herpes disease.[ADDRESS_598352] 15 years or more, if at all.  At a time when 
approximately 20% of all sexually active women in the [LOCATION_002] have HSV -2 genital 
infection,14 and an additional 20% -50% of all genital herpes is caused by [CONTACT_164639] -1,[ADDRESS_598353] no history of genital herpes.6,9,15  While maternal antiviral supp ression is routinely 
provided near the end of pregnancy to women with a history of genital herpes,16-19 it is 
ineffective in completely suppressing viral shedding at delivery.18-21  Importantly, the CASG 
recently has reported cases of infants who developed neonatal herpes despi[INVESTIGATOR_466548].22,23  Furthermore, the approach of providing antiviral suppression  
to women with a history of genital herpes (classified as having “recurrent” infection) is 
intrinsically flawed , given that 60 -80% of women delivering babies that develop neonatal HSV 
disease have no known history of genital herpes themselves .  Further, b etween 25% and 57% 
of women acquiring genital herpes during pregnancy (classified as having “first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_466540]” 
or “first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_466541] -primary” infection) who are asymptomatically shedding at delivery will 
transmit the virus to their babies, compared wit h only 2% of women with recurrent genital 
herpes who are asymptomatically shedding at delivery.1,24-[ADDRESS_598354] risk of transmission of virus to their neonates.  
 
As noted above, since 85% of babies developi[INVESTIGATOR_466549],[ADDRESS_598355] advanced to the point where this can now be considered.  A 
recent study demonstrated that real -time PCR detection of HSV when women are in labor is 
feasible.27  However, the assay used in that study required significant technical preparation of 
reagents and utilized multiple aliquoting steps on different machines to perform it correctly.  
Thus, this report served as proof of concept that real -time PCR detection in the labor and 
delivery suites is possible, but this assay is not a system which can be expanded to large -scale 
testing and utilization at multiple institutions.

An alternative approach is to use the GeneXpert PCR platform (Figure 
1) to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_466550] s with the intent of delivery .  The 
GeneXpert system completely automates sample preparation, 
performing all the complex steps of DNA extraction in a single 
microf luidic cartridge (Figure 2).  Once the sample nucleic acid is 
extracted, it is moved in a com pletely automated fashion from the 
sample processing chamber in the cartridge into the reaction tube where amplification and 
detection of viral DNA take place (Figure 3).  All that is required to perform the test is to collect a 
genital swab and place it i n viral transport media,  and then to  add approximately 1 mL of viral 
transport media to the Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598356] the cartridge in the GeneXpert instrument, and 
press “start.”  The results then come off of the comput er in about  an 
hour.  
 
Significant parallels exist 
between the approach we 
will study in this staged trial 
and the prevention of 
neonatal disease caused by 
[CONTACT_19313] B Streptococcus 
(GBS).  Approximately 25% 
to 30% of pregnant women 
have genital herpes,11,14 
compared with 10% -30% 
who are colonized with GBS in the vagina or rectum.28-
30  The incidence of neonatal herpes (0.33 cases per 
1,000 live births)1 is essentially i dentical to that of neonatal group B Streptococcal disease 
(0.34 -0.37 cases per 1,000 live births).31  Both infections occur in neonates who are exposed to 
the pathogen in the mother’s vagina.  Colonization with GBS is intermittent,32,[ADDRESS_598357] for only a few hours at a time,37,38 further necessitating that testing for the virus 
occurs at the time of delivery.  
2.2 Scientific Rationale  
With no HSV vaccine in  the near - or intermediate -term future, reduction in cases of neonatal 
HSV disease requires improved identification of those babies at risk of neonatal infection.  To do

Collaborative Antiviral Study Group  DMID Protocol #[ADDRESS_598358] that is simple 
to perform and scalable to administer from a programmat ic standpoint.  In this study, The Xpert 
HSV 1/2 Assay will be compared to routine PCR in both populations, and to viral culture in the 
symptomatic population.  The Xpert’s  sensitivity and specificity will be determined in 
symptomatic nonpregnant women , and its positive and negative agreement will be determined 
in asymptomatic pregnant women.  All Xpert and routine PCR testing  will be performed at the 
UAB Central Laboratory , with the Xpert PCR and routine PCR being performed in batches) . 
The outcomes of neo nates delivered to the 12,500 pregnant women enrolled on the current 
study ( approximately half  of whom will have virologic testing and neonatal outcomes recorded, 
and half of whom will have neonatal outcomes recorded  and will have specimens banked for 
poss ible future virologic testing ) will be queried and rates of neonatal HSV disease without 
preemptive therapy will be determined.   These incidence d ata will be compared with the 
incidence data from Brown et al.[ADDRESS_598359] 60,000 wome n conducted over a 20 
year period, this group of researchers has reported an incidence rate for neonatal HSV disease 
of 1 in 3,200 live births.  
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1  Potential Risks  
As a natural history and laboratory comparative study that does not  include a therapeutic 
intervention, the potential risks relate to obtaining  the vaginal sample  or lesion swab,  and having 
blood drawn.  For the vaginal (non-lesion) sampling, there is the possibility of minor discomfort 
of a swab in the vaginal vault.  For the lesion swab, there is a possibility also of minor discomfort 
in the area of the lesion.  For the blood sampling, there is the possibility of associated 
discomfort, bruising at the phlebotomy site, and rarely an infection.  
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
For those women in Group 1 , culture -confirmation of HSV infection will be provided to their 
clinicians .  For those women in Group 2 , educational materials on neonatal HSV infection will be 
provided to the mothers.

Collaborative Antiviral Study Group  DMID Protocol #[ADDRESS_598367] of pregnant and nonpregnant 
women will be evaluated, and the utility of a new cartridge -based PCR platform (the GeneXpert 
system with the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay cartridge) for the detection of HSV -1 or HSV -2 will be 
assessed.  The study will be conducted at 15 academic medical centers throughout the United 
States.   Virologic assessments  will be made in two populations:   1) nonpregnant women in STI 
clinics  (likely at one or two study centers)  with clinically -apparent genital HSV lesions ( Group 1, 
n=300 ), and 2 ) pregnant women admitted with the intent of delivery  (at all study centers)  with no 
visible evidence of genital HSV infection ( Group 2, n= 12,500 ).  Women in each group will have 
specimens obtained from genital lesions (Group 1) or vaginal swabs (Group 2) .  Specimens 
from all women in Group 1 will be evaluated by [CONTACT_466577], routine HSV PCR, and Xpert HSV  
1/2 PCR.  For both groups, Study Day 1  is the day that the genital or vaginal swab is obtained.  
Approximately half of the women (determined randomly) in Group 2 will be tested by [CONTACT_466578]  1/2 PCR ; specimens from the rest of the women in Group 2  will be 
stored for possible testing in the future by [CONTACT_466574]  1/2 PCR.   In this 
manner, we will maximize the data from which to compare Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598368] of this study, clinical staff may perform research activities (e.g., swabs for virologic 
testing, blood for serologic testing), under th e direction of the site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_126985].  
Lesion s wabs from women in Group 1 (non -pregnant women from STI clinics ) will be placed in 
viral transport media, refrigerated at 4°C, and sent to the laboratory for processing.  The 
laboratory wi ll perform real time analysis by [CONTACT_466579] a portion of the transport media, 
and freeze the remainder of the transport media in aliquots for subsequent  batch  testing by 
[CONTACT_466574] 1/2 PCR  at the UAB Central Laboratory . 
Vaginal swabs  from women in Group 2 (pregnant women admitted with the intent of delivery) 
will be placed in viral transport media, frozen at -20°C  or colder , and batch -shipped to the UAB 
Central Laboratory for future PCR analysis by [CONTACT_466574] 1/2 PC R.  
Specimens from approximately half of  the Group 2 women will be analyzed by  [CONTACT_466568].  All 
specimens evaluated by [CONTACT_466580] 1/2 PCR .  The 
laboratory personnel performing each type of procedure (routine PCR for Gr oups 1 and 2; 
culture for Group 1; and Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR for Groups 1 and 2) will be masked to the results of 
the other tests  for a given subject.   A blood specimen will be obtained from each nonpregnant

13 (Group 1) and pregnant (Group 2) woman  on Study Day 1, and if she is determined to be 
shedding HSV  by [CONTACT_466568], Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598369] of care.  Correl ation of viral typi[INVESTIGATOR_466542] -1 and 
HSV-2 serostatus will allow for categorization of infection (first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_466540], first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_466552], or recurrent infection).  
HSV culture results from women in Group [ADDRESS_598370] or her physician  are two -fold:  1) the 
PCR analyses are perfor med in batches, so no results will be available within a timeframe in 
which clinical decisions on the woman’s care could be made: and 2)  neither routine HSV PCR 
nor Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598371] result in this population is 
not known .  Even if PCR results (routine HSV PCR or Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay) could be obtained 
in a real-time (non-batched) fashion, it would be irresponsible to rep ort results from a non -
validated test to the subject and her health care provider, as they may be influenced to make 
clinical decisions based on this unvalidated information. Furthermore, using the results of this 
research test for clinical decision making  is not the intent of this study protocol.   All pregnant 
women in Group [ADDRESS_598372] 60,000 
women conducted over a 20 year  period , this group of researchers has reported an incidence 
rate for neonatal HSV disease of 1 in 3,200 live births.  
Study involvement for women in Group 1  will be limited to only 1 day  on Study Day 1  (day of 
virologic sampling).  Women in Group [ADDRESS_598373].

active genital HSV lesions (Group 1, n=300) or  women [ADDRESS_598375] visible genital HSV lesions or prodromal symptoms (Group 2, 
n=12,500).  Women of all races will be included.  
5.1 Recrui tment Strategies  
Identification of study subjects will be done based on the local standards of practice and IRB 
approved means.  Clinicians who are care providers for these patients will identify patients who 
would generally qualify for inclusion in Group 1 or Group 2  of the study  and will confirm that it is 
acceptable by [CONTACT_466581].  Group 1 subjects will be recruited from the STI clinic at the Health Department and/or 
similar outpat ient facility.  Group 2 subjects will be recruited from labor and delivery facilities 
and/or identified through obstetric practices.  Subjects can sign informed consent in the labor 
and delivery facilities, or can sign informed consent prior to that time i f the woman is 34 weeks 
estimated gestational age or older.  However, no study related samples/procedures can be 
initiated until subject is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466553].   Each participating facilit y will determine the appropriate setting from which 
to recruit subjects.  IRB approval will be obtained for each site’s recruitment plan .  Site 
investigators (who may also be the treating clinician) or study coordinators will provide 
information about the intended study population to the clinicians to aid in identifying appropriate 
patients to be approached for inclusion and consent .  Consenting will be conducted by [CONTACT_5055] (e.g., investigator and/or study coordinator /trained designee ) for Group 1  and 
Group 2.  Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study required procedures.   The State 
of Alabama has recently (2015) changed the age of consent from 19 years to 18 years.  As a 
result, Group 1 (which is still enrolling at the time of amendmen t of the protocol to version 4.0 ) 
will now enroll women who are [ADDRESS_598376] Inclusion Criteria

6.[ADDRESS_598378] Device  
The Xpert HSV1/[ADDRESS_598379] for the automated and rapid detection and qualitative differentiation of HSV 1 
and HSV 2 in clinician -collected genital swabs.   The Xpert HSV1/2 Assay system performs 
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of DNA targets after an initial sample 
processing step.  The system consists of a GeneXpert® instrument, personal computer, and 
disposable fluidic cartridges that are designed to complete sample preparation and real -time 
PCR for detection of HSV1 and/or HSV2 in about 1 hour.  
The single -use cartridges contain:  1) eleven chambers for holding sample, reagents, or other 
materials ; 2) a valve bod y composed of a plunger and syringe barrel ; 3) a rotary valve system 
for controlling the movement of fluids between chambers ; 4) an area for capturing, 
concentrating, washing, and lysing of virus ; 5) dry, real -time PCR reagents ; 6) liquid reagents 
for PCR ; and 7) an integrated PCR reaction tube that can be automatically filled by [CONTACT_466582].  To eliminate test -to-test contamination, all fluids including amplicons are contained 
within the disposable cartridge.  The instrument never comes into contact [CONTACT_57999] h any fluids within 
the cartridge.  Each cartridge is intended to test one sample.   
The primers and probes in the Xpert HSV1/[ADDRESS_598380] cartridge includes a Sample Processing Control (SPC), a  Sample 
Adequacy Control (SAC), and a Probe Check Control (PCC).  The SPC is present to control for 
adequate processing of the target bacteria and to monitor the presence of inhibitors in the PCR 
reaction.  The SAC reagents detect the presence of a single copy human gene and monitor 
whether the sample contains human DNA.  The PCC verifies reagent rehydration, PCR tube 
filling in the cartridge, probe integrity, and dye stability.  
Cepheid (Sunnyvale, CA) will provide the GeneXpert system (instrument and cartr idges).   Xpert 
HSV 1/2 Assay cartridges will be appropriately labeled in accordance with regulations , and will 
be stored as indicated in the package insert.   The UAB Central Laboratory personnel will be 
responsible for maintaining logs of receipt, accounta bility, storage conditions of the Xpert HSV 
1/2 Assay investigational device and associated records and results.  Documents and the 
investigational device will be stored in a secure and accessible location.  
6.2 Study Procedures  
If a patient is eligible for the  study based on information regarding inclusion/exclusion criteria 
that is collected as part of the standard medical care (and not obtained for study purposes), then 
Collaborative Antiviral Study Group  DMID Protocol #[ADDRESS_598381] the study staff who will approach the patient and initiate the 
informed consent process (Section  11).  For Group 1, signing of the informed consent document 
will take place on the same day as study procedures.  For Group 2, s igning of the informed 
consent document may occur on or before Study Day 1 .  Patients may be provided with study 
information prior to confirmation of eligibility for enrollment .  After consent is obtained, the study 
participant  will begin pa rticipation in the study procedures . 
Following informed consent and confirmation of eligibility criteria, virologic sampling will be 
obtained from women in Group 1 and Group 2.  No laboratory tests will be done to confirm 
eligibility.  For the Group 1 wome n (nonpregnant women with active genital HSV lesions), a 
swab of the lesion (s) will be obtained and placed in viral transport media.  For the Group 2 
women (pregnant women without active lesions), following admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466554]  a swab of the vaginal vault /canal  will be 
obtained and placed in viral transport media; utilization of a speculum examination is not 
required in this sampling process.  The specimen should be obtained before delivery , but may 
be obtained following delivery as long as it is collected within [ADDRESS_598382]’s  virologic studies identify HSV shedding.  
Women in Group 2 will be provided with printed material describing neonatal HSV signs and 
symptoms.   These w omen (Group 2 ) or their designated representative  also will be contact[CONTACT_466583] 30 and Study Da y 90 for self -reporting of the delivery mode (vaginal vs. 
Cesarean delivery) and the development of neonatal HSV symptoms and signs post -delivery .  It 
is acceptable to initiate contact [CONTACT_466584] 30 day window and multiple attempts may 
be needed  to reach the mother or her designated representative .  The initial maternal  Informed 
Consent document will include obtaining parental permission  for the neonate  in order to ask 
these questions .  Verbal reporting from the mother on maternal receipt of anti viral therapy at 
any point following enrollment also will be captured from all women in Group 2.  
HSV culture results (not PCR) from w omen in Group [ADDRESS_598383] or her physician  are 
two-fold:  1) the PCR analyses are performed in batches, so no results will be available within a 
timeframe in which clinical decision s on the woman’s care could be made: and 2) neither routine 
HSV PCR nor Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598384] result in this 
population is not known .  Even if PCR results (routine HSV PCR or Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay) could 
be obtained in a real-time (non-batched) fashion, it would be irresponsible to report results from 
a non -validated test to the subject and her health care provider, as they ma y be influenced to 
make clinical decisions based on this unvalidated information. Furthermore, using the results of 
this research test for clinical decision making is not the intent of this study protocol.

6.3 Laboratory Evaluations  
6.3.1  Laboratory Evaluations/ Assays  
Virologic Testing  
Samples obtained from women in Group 1 and Group 2 will be tested  in batches  for HSV DNA 
by [CONTACT_466576] 1/2 PCR and routine PCR.  Additionally, samples from women in Group 1 will be 
tested in real time by [CONTACT_466577].   In this trial, a ll of these virologic tests will be Research 
Laboratory Evaluations (i.e., they would not be performed if the subject were not enroll ed in the 
study).   Routine HSV PCR from genital mucosa is not an FDA -cleared test.   All Xpert and 
routine PCR testing  will be conducted at the UAB CLIA -certified Central Laboratory.   Bi-
directional sequencing will be performed on specimens with discordant results between the 
Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR and routine PCR from asymptomatic pregnant women admitted with the 
intent of delivery,  and between Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR and HSV culture in nonpregnant women.  
The primers used for bi -directional sequencing will be differe nt from those used in the Xpert 
HSV 1/2 PCR and the routine PCR methods.  Note: The results of discrepant analysis are for 
informational purposes only and will not be used to recalculate the performance of the Xpert 
HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598386]’s virologi c stud ies identif y HSV 
shedding.   In this trial, all serologic tests will be Research Laboratory Evaluations (i.e., they 
would not be performed if the subject were not enrolled in the study).  The window of time for 
collection of this specimen from women i n Group 2 is ± 3 days.  Remnant blood samples from 
clinical laboratory draws may be retrieved for this serologic testing.  Informed consent will be 
obtained prior to any study required procedures.

20 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Hypotheses  
For pregnant women, we hypothesize that the long term expected positive percent agreement of 
HSV DNA using the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay  is 95% as evidenced by [CONTACT_466588].   Therefore, with a sample size of between  [ADDRESS_598388] over 
a 95% probability of obtaining a point estimate greater than 91.8% with a lower bound of a 95% 
CI greater than 85%.   This can be summarized in the form of hypothesis testing as:  
 
H0: Positive Percent Agreement = 95%  
HA: Posit ive Percent Agreement < 85%  
Sample Size 135 -150 
Critical Value = 11FN, (or point estimate > 91.85% with lower 95% CI > 85%)  
Target Alpha Value = 5%, Power > 95%.   
 
For non -pregnant women, we hypothesize that the long term expected sensitivity of HSV DNA 
using the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay  is 95.34% as evidenced by a 95% confidence interval containing 
this value.   Therefore, with a sample size of between [ADDRESS_598389] a 9 5% 
probability of obtaining a point estimate greater 93.3% with a lower bound of a 95% CI greater 
than 90%.   This can be summarized in the form of hypothesis testing as:  
 
H0: Sensitivity = 95.34%  
HA: Sensitivity < 90%  
Sample Size 270 -300 
Critical Value = 18 false negative (FN), (or point estimate > 93.3% with lower 95% CI > 89%)  
Target Alpha Value = 5%, Power > 95%.  
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
Approximately 6,000 pregnant women (of the 12,500 enrolled) admitted with the intent of 
delivery will be tested  to detect 144 (2.4%) who are shedding HSV by [CONTACT_954].   A subject who 
enrolls on the study b ut does not have a vaginal specimen obtained will not count toward the 
target sample size.  The process of determining the 6,000 to be tested by [CONTACT_466589] :  
IDs of pregnant women enrolled in a given 3 month period (each quarter ) will be randomly 
assigned by [CONTACT_466590] (1) the group to be tested by [CONTACT_466591] (2) the group not to be tested by 
[CONTACT_954].  This will enable us to have better representation over time and across sites.  Specimens 
will be collected and tested from an  additional 300 nonpregnant w omen presenting to STI clinics 
with active herpetic lesions who are shedding HSV by [CONTACT_466592].  A 95% confidence 
interval will be constructed for the sensitivity of Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay relative to culture for the 
nonpregnant women population.  S ince we do not anticipate many negative results in the

21 symptomatic nonpregnant population, we may not be able to estimate the specificity of the 
GeneXpert in this population.  For the pregnant women population, 95% confidence intervals 
will be constructed for the true positive and negative percent agreement between Xpert and 
routine PCR .  The sample size justification considers the width and lower bound of these  95% 
confidence interval s for a single proportion  using Clopper -Pearson method (also known as the  
Fisher’s Exact CI)  for small samples and large -sample confidence intervals for samples of 
greater than 100 (Ref Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Hollander and Wolf, Wiley, NY, NY 
1973) .  SAS version 9.2 was used for these calculations.  
Table 1 displays the minimum number of  Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay positives from the total number 
of routine PCR positives in order to get a lower bound of a 95% confidence interval of at least 
86%. With the expected 144 routine PCR positives from the pregnant women admitted with  the 
intent of delivery , if the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay finds 133 positives, then the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval for the true positive percent agreement will have a width of 9.4% and the 
resulting interval estimate is [86.7%, 96.1%]. Similar interpr etations may be applied to the other 
cases considered in this table.  With an expected 5856 negatives out of 6000 pregnant women, 
the 95% confidence interval for the negative percent agreement will be very tight. In particular, if 
the observed negative per cent agreement is 97% (i.e., Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay  finds 5680 
negatives out of the 5856 routine PCR negatives), then the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval for the true negative percent agreement of Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598390] a width of  0.9% and the resulting interval estimate is [96.5%, 97.4%]. The reason for using 
positive and negative percent agreement instead of sensitivity and specificity is that routine PCR 
is not considered a gold standard.

the minimum number of Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay positives from the total number of culture 
positives out of 300 subjects in order to get a lower bound of a 95% confidence interval of 
approximately 90% .  Since we conservatively expect 27 0 of the 300 (90%) to be shedding HSV 
by [CONTACT_921] , this is the smallest number of positive cultures considered in Table 2 .  To interpret , if

7.3 Participant Enrollment and Follow -Up 
Subjects will be enrolled  in one of two groups based upon their clinical status.  Group 1  (n=300)  
will consist of women with clinically apparent herpetic genital lesions in STI Clinics.  Group 2 
(n=12,500) will consist of women without clinically apparent genital HSV lesions who a re 
admitted with the intent of delivery .  For women in Group 2, all study procedures will be uniform 
at each study site; once specimens from a given subject are received in the UAB Central 
Laboratory, the Study Biostatistician will randomly assign them to either batched  processing by 
[CONTACT_466593].  Those that are batch  
processed by [CONTACT_466594] 1/[ADDRESS_598394]  batched  PCR analysis 
of their specimens performed, with the other half having their specimens stored . 
Subjects in Group 1 and Group 2 are not seen in person after their involvement on Study Day 1.  
HSV culture results from women in Group 1 will be reported to their treating physician.  Women 
in Group 2 or their designated representative  will be contact[CONTACT_466595] 30 and 
Study Day 90  to assess for neonatal treatment for HSV infection and for maternal mode of 
delivery .

23 7.4 Analysi s Plan  
Analyses of Group 1 and Group 2 may occur at different times, if Group 1 (n=300) fully accrues 
earlier than Group 2 (n=12,500).  Demographics and clinical characteristics will be summarized 
using means and standard deviations for continuous variable s and counts and proportions for 
categorical variables. For continuous variables and chi -squared test s for categorical variables , 
ANOVA (or its nonparametric analog Kruskall -Wallis)  will be utilized to compare these 
characteristics among groups of particip ants.  
For pregnant women, the primary goal of this study is to estimate the positive and negative 
percent agreement  of the Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay relative to routine PCR methods. For 
nonpregnant women, we will be able to estimate the sensitivity of the Xpert  HSV 1/2 Assay 
relative to culture .  As a secondary analysis, we will also estimate the positive percent 
agreement of the Xpert  HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598395] 95% confidence intervals for a single 
proportion .  To compare the performance of Xpert with routine PCR for the combined groups 
(pregnant and non -pregnant women) in detectin g HSV -1 and HSV -2 virus, we present the 
results of all samples tested in a 2x2 table separately for each type of virus. We will perform 
McNemar’s test and construct 95% confidence interval estimates for the positive and negative 
percent agreement for each type of virus.  
Since it is also of interest to estimate the true proportion of babies developi[INVESTIGATOR_466556], we also will construct a confidence interval for the true 
proportion  using either exact or large -sample met hods .

27 research.  These specimens will be labeled with a code number and not w ith the study 
participant’s name.  At the time of consent for study participation, study participants will have the 
opportunity to either agree to have their specimens used in future research or decline to have 
their specimens used in future research.  The  study participant  will indicate her preference by 
[CONTACT_171909], “Future Use of Specimens”.  Non -protocol designated, future testing of samples will be 
performed  only on samples from study participants who have consented for future testing of 
samples.  
Samples may be shared with other investigators at other institutions or with the manufacturer of 
the GeneXpert cartridge.  The samples will not be sold or used direc tly for production of any 
commercial product.  No human genetic tests will be performed on samples.  Long term storage 
of residual samples will be established according to OHRP guidelines ensuring that codes or 
other personally identifying links will not b e distributed to future researchers.  
The specimens will be stored indefinitely in the UAB Central Virology Laboratory at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham.  Specimens from study participants will be labeled and 
coded without study participant’s ident ifiers.  If the study participant has indicated in the signed 
consent form that she does not agree to allow the future use of specimens for future research, 
then her specimens will be destroyed at the completion of the study.  
Collaborative Antiviral Study Group  DMID Protocol #[ADDRESS_598399] be documented in the medical records, clinic 
chart, and/or research chart.  The consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_466602].  A copy of the signed consent form m ust be 
provided to the study participant.  Signed consent forms must remain in each study participant’s 
study file and must be available for verification by [CONTACT_9534].  
 
The investigational nature and research objectives of this trial, the  procedure, and its attendant 
risks and discomforts will be carefully explained to the study participant.  A signed informed 
consent document will be obtained from each study participant prior to entry into this study.  
This informed consent document will describe the study -related procedures for the woman, and 
for women in Group [ADDRESS_598400] the infant’s medical chart.  Waiver of 
Assent (or obtaining parental permission) will be provided at the time the signature [CONTACT_466611] (see Section 11.1).  At any time during participation in the 
protocol, if new information becomes available relating to risks, t his information will be provided 
orally or in writing to all enrolled or prospective study participants. Documentation will be 
provided to the Central Facilitated IRB/IEC overseeing the study (or to each study site, if the site 
does not utilize the Central  Facilitated IRB) and, if necessary, the informed consent will be 
amended to reflect any relevant information.  
 
There will be two consent forms, one for Group [ADDRESS_598401] or her 
physician  are two -fold:  1) the PCR analyses are performed in batches, so no results will be 
available within a timeframe in which clinical decisions on the woman’s care could be made: and 
2) routine HSV PCR and Xpert HSV 1/[ADDRESS_598402] result is not known .  Even if PCR results (routine HSV 
PCR or Xpert HSV 1/2 Assay) could be obtained in a real-time (non-batched) fashion, it would 
be irresponsible to report results from a non -validated test  to the subject and her health care 
provider, as they may be influenced to make clinical decisions based on this unvalidated 
information. Furthermore, using the results of this research test for clinical decision making is 
not the intent of this study prot ocol.  
An investigator shall seek such consent only under circumstances that provide the prospective 
subject sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and that minimize the 
possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information t hat is given to the subject shall be in 
language understandable to the subject or the representative.

The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) member journals has adopted 
a trials -registration policy as a condition for publication.  This policy requires that all clinical trials 
be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_38082].  Other biomedical journals are cons idering adopting similar 
policies.  
Unless exempted, this trial will be registered prior to enrollment of study subjects.  It is the 
responsibility of the study’s PI (e.g., [CONTACT_114845]) to register the non -exempted trials and post 
results in compliance wi th Public Law [ADDRESS_598415] of 2007 (FDAAA).

a. Lesion s wabs from nonpregnant women will be placed in viral transport media, refrigerated at 2-8°C, 
and sent to the laboratory for real time analysis by [CONTACT_466579] a portion of the transport media , 
and the remainder of the transpor t media will be frozen in aliquots for subsequent batch testing by 
[CONTACT_466608] 1/2 PCR  at the  UAB Central Laboratory  
b. HSV culture results from women in Group 1 will be reported to their treating physician  
c. Blood for serologic testing will b e collected from all nonpregnant women enrolled , but testing will be 
performed only on samples from those women who are  determined to be  shedding HSV genitally by 
[CONTACT_921], routine PCR, or Xpert HSV 1/2 PCR  
d. Vaginal s wabs from pregnant women will be placed i n viral transport media, frozen at -20°C  or colder , 
and batch -shipped to the UAB Central Laboratory for batched analysis as follows:  specimens from 
approximately half of the women in Group 2 will be tested by [CONTACT_466573]  1/2 
PCR ; specime ns from the rest of the women in Group 2 will be stored for possible testing in the future 
by [CONTACT_466574]  1/2 PCR.  
e. Blood for serologic testing will be collected (or remnant sample may be retrieved) from all pregnant 
women enrolled  (window : ± 3 days), but testing will be performed only on samples from pregnant 
women who are determined to be shedding HSV genitally by [CONTACT_466609]  1/[ADDRESS_598428] 4 -6 weeks of lif e.  Maternal receipt of antiviral therapy at any point following 
enrollment will be captured.

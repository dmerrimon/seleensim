Phase of Development: I  
Objectives:  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the abuse liability of VLN  mentholated  cigarettes (0.4 mg nicotine/gram of 
tobacco) relative to own -brand mentholated cigarettes and  4 mg nicotine polacrilex gum  
under controlled use and uncontrolled  (ad libitum) use conditions.  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To compare the nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of VLN mentholated  cigarettes 
relative to own -brand mentholated  cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum  under controlled 
use and uncontrolled use conditions.  
• To characterize product use behavior of VLN mentholated  cigarettes, own -brand 
mentholated  cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum.  
Methodology:  
This study will be a randomized, two-part, 3-way crossover designed to evaluate the abuse liability, 
PK, and product use behavior associated with study products, including VLN mentholated  cigarettes, 
subjects ’ own-brand  mentholated  cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum in healthy adult male and 
female exclusive smokers.  Subjects will participate in a standard Screening visit and one 7-day 
Confined Assessment Phase , which will include a product trial session (Day -1), and two study parts 
(Part A and Part B).  Following the Screening visit, eligibl e subjects will check -in to the study site on 
Day -1. Following the polacrilex  gum training session , subjects will be required to abstain from 
nicotine - and tobacco -containing products for approximately [ADDRESS_1107958] use 
session on Day s 1 to 3; use of other nicotine -containing products will be prohibited  throughout the 
study.  No additional tobacco or nicotine products will be provided after the second product use on 
Days 4 to 6.

On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to one of three  produ ct sequence groups in Part A, which will 
consist of an ad libitum product use session for each of the following study products for 4 hours in a 
randomized crossover manner (Days 1 to 3; one product per day):  
▪ Product A: VLN Menthol cigarette  
▪ Product B : Own -brand menthol  filtered standard king size cigarette   
▪ Product C : 4 mg Nicotine polacrilex gum ( Nicorette® White Ice  Mint ™) 
A pharmacodynamic measure (“use product again ” visual analog scale [VAS]) will be administered at 
the end of each ad libitum product use period . Product use behaviors (i.e.,  number of units  consumed,  
duration of gum in mouth) will be collected throughout each ad libitum product use period.  
Upon completion of Part A, subjects will be randomized to one of three  product sequence groups in 
Part B, which will consist of  3 study days (Days 4 to 6), with one product per day. Each study day will 
consist of : 1) Controlled Product Use Session ([ADDRESS_1107959]  menthol  cigarette [maximum 3  ± 2 seconds per puff]  at approximately  30 ± 5-second interpuff 
intervals, or chew the nicotine polacrilex gum using the “chew and park ” method for 10 minutes); and 
2) Uncontrolled Product Use Session (ad libitum use for 10 minutes). The Controlled Product Use 
Session and Uncon trolled Product Use Session will be separated by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1107960] use behavior (Uncontrolled only) will be 
collected at various time points each day (See Table  1).  
Safety assessments  including adverse events  (AEs) , physical examinations, vital signs (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
pulse rate, blood pressure, and oral temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests 
(clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), and urine drug and alcohol screens w ill be 
collected at designated time points throughout the study. Subjects will be  discharged from the clinic on 
Day 6, once all  procedures are completed  (or at Early Termination).  
Number of Subjects  (Planned):  
An appropriate number of subjects  will be randomized on Day 1 (Part A) to ensure that a minimum of 
54 subjects complete the study. Replacement subjects may be enrolled to ensure that the minimum 
number of subjects complete the study.

Product use behavior  will be summarized by [CONTACT_802741].  
Pharmacokinetics : 
Descriptive statistics of plasma nicotine concentrations will be tabulated by [CONTACT_802742]. Derived PK parameters (both unadjusted for baseline and baseline -
adjusted)  will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summaries and individual data will be 
provided for plasma nicotine -adjusted concentrations.  
A linear mixed model for analysis of variance (Proc Mixed) will be performed on the baseline -adjusted 
log transformed nicotine PK parameter s in Part B . The model will include sequence, study product, and 
period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Sequence will be  tested 
using subject nes ted-within sequence as the error term. From each  model , the geometric LSM and 95% 
CI will be calculated for each  study product. Separate analyses will be performed on the parameters 
calculated for the controlled  and uncontrolled  product use  sessions . Geome tric mean ratios for each 
pair comparison, 95% CI and p value will be provided.  
The same linear mixed effect model as used for the analysis of C max( controlled ) will be  used for 
Cmax( uncontrolled ) of second product use in Part B, and  for AUC following all product uses.  The Hodges -

Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page [ADDRESS_1107978], the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was granted the authority to regulate tobacco products 
including the nicotine content of cigarettes. In July 2017, FDA Commissioner  Scott Gottlieb, 
M.D., announced the FDA’s intention to limit nicotine in cigarettes to minimally or non -
addictive levels. During his announcement, [CONTACT_743742] stated that it has long been known that 
nicotine is the primary addictive component of cigarett es and that if smokers lose their addiction 
to cigarettes, they will be free to choose when and how often to smoke.  A key component in the 
FDA’s announced plan is to provide current smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit using 
nicotine with other, les s harmful , means to obtain it. In other words, to provide a migration route 
away from traditional cigarettes to other types of tobacco or nicotine products such as cigarettes 
based on heat not burn technology, traditional smokeless, Snus, or electronic nic otine delivery 
system (END S) products.  
Historically, tobacco harm reduction initiatives have focused on efforts to prevent or reduce 
tobacco initiation rates, increase quit rates , and decrease recidivism. The proposed r educ tion of 
nicotine  cigarettes is believed to represent a viable policy tool to impact cigarette initiation rates 
and cigarette quit rates . Studies conducted to date indicate that reducing the nicotine content of 
cigarettes to non -addictive levels would potentially limit the reinforcing  effects of cigarettes. A 
number of recent studies  suggest s that cigarettes with very low nicotine (VLN) content are 
associated with a positive set of outcome s, including reduc tions in the number of cigarettes  
smok ed, reduction s in nicotine exposure  and nicotine dependence, increase d abstinence from 
smoking, reduced exposure to toxicants , and fewer adverse events  (AEs)  (Rupprecht et al., 2017  
; Donny et al ., 2007 ; Donny et al., 2015 ; Benowitz et al., 2007 ; Benowitz et al.,  2009 ; Benowitz 
et al.,  2012 ; Hatsukami et al., 2013 ). These studies  evaluate d cigarettes with nicotine content 
ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_1107979] to RTI/ National Institute on drug Abuse (NIDA) .  22nd Century Group , Inc. is 
currently evaluating the commercial potential of a menthol and non -menthol VLN  cigarette (0.4 
mg nicotine/gram of tobacco) . It is anticipated that these cigarettes will provide similar benefits 
to a consumer that switches from their usual brand to the VLN cigarette as those reported in the 
literature (Rupprecht et al., 2017 ; Donny et al., 2007 ; Donny et al., 2015 ; Benowitz et al., 2007 ; 
2009 ; 2012 ; Hatsukami et  al., 2013 ).  
5.2. Study Rationale  
The purpose of the current study is to provide an abuse liability assessment of VLN mentholated 
cigarettes compared with own -brand mentholated cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum in 
current manufactured filtered king size cigarette smokers , as recommended in “ FDA  Draft 
Guidance for Industry Modified Risk T obacco Products ( March 2012 )”. Results of this study

mentholated  cigarettes, subje cts’ own-brand mentholated  cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum in 
healthy adult male and female exclusive smokers. The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening, 
a Confined Assessment  Phase consisting of product training session , Part A, and Part B , and an 
End of Study  Phase .  
7.1.1.  Screening  Phase  (Visit 1)  
The Screening Phase will be completed during a clinic  visit within [ADDRESS_1107982] medical screen . 
7.1.2.  Confined Assessment Phase (Visit 2)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Check -in and Product  Trial (Day -1) 
Subjects who successfully complete the Screening Phase will return to the clinical unit on Day -[ADDRESS_1107983]  
training session with the nicotine polacrilex gum in order to familiarize themselves with the 
“chew and park ” method , which requires subjects to chew the gum until they experience a 
tingling sensation, park the gum between the cheek and gum until the tingling subsi des, and then  
begin chewing again. On Day -1, subjects will also complete a training session on the 
pharmacodynamic  questionnaires. Subjects will be required to abstain from using nicotine - and 
tobacco -containing products for approximately [ADDRESS_1107984] use session in Part 
A. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Part A (Day 1 to 3)  
On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to one of three  product sequence groups in Part A, which 
will consist of an ad libitum product use session of each of the following study products for 4 
hours i n a randomized crossover manner (one product per day):  
▪ Product A: VLN menthol cigarette  
▪ Product B: Own -brand menthol cigarette  
▪ Product C: Nicorette® White Ice  Mint ™ 
A pharmacodynamic measure (“use product again ” visual analog scale [V AS]) will be 
administe red at the end of each ad libitum product use period and product use behaviors (i.e.,  
number of units consumed, duration of gum in mouth ) will be collected throughout each ad 
libitum product use period  (See Table  1).

Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 20 of 62  
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Part B (Day 4 to 6)  
Upon completion of Part A, subjects will be randomized to one of three  product sequence groups 
in Part B, which will consist of  3 study days (Days 4 to 6), with one product per day. Each study 
day will consist of : 1) Controlled Product Use Session ([ADDRESS_1107985]  menthol  cigarette [maximum 3 ± 2 seconds per puff] at approximately 30  ± 5-
second interpuff intervalsa, or chew the nicotine polacrilex gum using the “chew and park ” 
method for 10 minutes); and 2) Uncontrolled Product Use Session ( use of one unit of a product 
ad libitum for 10 minutes). The Controlled Product Use Session and Uncontrolled Product Use 
Sessio n will be separated by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1107986] use behavior (Uncontrolled  Product Use Session  only) will be collected 
at various time points each day (See Table  1). 
Safety assessments, including AEs, physical examinations, vital signs (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse 
rate, blood pressure, and oral temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical lab oratory tests 
(clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), urine drug screen (UDS) , and alcohol 
test will be collected at designated time points throughout the study.  
7.1.3.  End of Study or Early Termination  
Subjects will be discharged from the cl inic on Day 6 once all procedures are completed (or at 
Early Termination).  
The maximum duration of subject participation, including Screening will be approximately 5  
weeks.  
An overview of the study design is provided  in Figure  1. 
Study assessments and procedures will be performed at the visits and time points outlined in the 
Schedule  of Assessments ( Table  1).

 7.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The overall study design i s consistent with similar publicly  available clinical studies conducted 
with cigarettes, non -combustible nicotine products (i.e., e -cigarettes) or nicotine replacement 
therapy in that it will be conducted using a randomized, cross -over design . This approach 
controls for inter -individual variability with each subject acting as his/her own control ( Vansickel 
et al., 2010 ; McPherson et al., 2016 ; Stiles et al., 2017 ). Randomization will be used to avoid 
bias in the assignment of subjects to order of product use, to increase the likelihood that known 
and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demograph ics and baseline characteristics) are evenly 
balanced across groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across groups.  
Subjects will be healthy current co mbustible manufactured filtered king size menthol cigarette 
smokers , using their own -brand of menthol cigarettes as the positive control . This should serve 
as the most highly reinforcing product for cigarette smokers  and is more representative of a 
“real-world ” scenario . Consistent with the “continuum of risk” of tobacco a nd nicotine products , 
which suggests that nicotine replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_61346] a lower risk of abuse  (Fagerstrom 
and Eissenberg, 2012 ), addiction and harm  relative to combustible cigarettes , this study will also 
include  nicotine polacrilex gum as the negative control comparator . Nicotine polacrilex gum  has 
been shown to have low to moderate reinforcing effects compared with combustible cigarettes 
(Stiles et al., 2017 ). Although  traditional  abuse liability studies of pharmaceutical products 
include a placeb o comparator, the nature of the products in the current study will be apparent to 
the subjects , therefore , it is not possible to implement a true placebo control . Rather , the study 
includes b oth a positive and a negative control to test the sensitivity of the model , and to achieve 
a direct relative comparison  of the abuse liability of VLN mentholated cigarettes to own -brand 
mentholated cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum.  
The current study will include a pre -specified period of abstinence prior to each study product 
administration day (approximately 20 hours  in Part A and prior to controlled -use session in Part 
B, and 6 hours between controlled and uncontrolled -use sessions  in Part B ) to minimize the 
impact that residual nicotine concentrations may have on baseline pharmacodynamic , PK and 
physiological measurements. Consistent with previously published studies, the current study will 
include an ad libitum product use session , which will allow the subject to use the product as they 
would in a “real-world ” scenario with no limitation on amount of product used , for up to [ADDRESS_1107994] (i.e., [maximum 3 ± 2 seconds per puff] at approximately  30 ± 5-second 
interpuff intervals ) versus how they would use the product in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_802728].  
The current study will use measures of urge to smoke, positive effects, intent to use the product 
again, and negative effects as proxy measures for the relative reinforcing efficacy of VLN 
mentholated cigarettes , own-brand mentholated cigarettes  and [ADDRESS_1107995] mentholated cigarettes to satisfy the urge to smoke over the short term will be 
assessed using the “Urge to Smoke” question in the Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal Questionnaire 
measure and positive effe cts will be assessed using the “ Is the product ‘Pleasant ’ right now? ” 
question in the Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire ; both will be administered as 100 -point

 VAS . The “ Use Product Again” bipolar VAS has been included at the end of the ad libitum us e 
session  in Part A and [ADDRESS_1107996] products. Additional subjective effects will be assessed with “at -the-moment” 
VAS ( Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire , Tobacco/Nicotin e Withdrawal  Questionnaire) 
during the Controlled and Uncontrolled Use Sessions to evaluate the magnitude, onset, and offset 
of product effects and withdrawal symptoms during and after controlled use of the study 
products.

 8. SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION  
An appropriate number of subjects will be randomized on Day 1 (Part A) to ensure that a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1107997] meet  each one of the following inclusion criteria in order to be eligible for 
participation  in the study : 
1. Must provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol -specific 
procedures.  
2. Male and female adults, between 22 to 65 years of age, inclusive.  
3. Body mass index (BMI) within 18.0 to 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive (minimum weight of at least 
50.0 kg at Screening).  
4. Healthy, as determined by [CONTACT_802736], physical examination, 
12-lead ECG, vital signs or laboratory (including hematology, clinical chemistry, 
urinalysis, and serology) findings at Screening,  as judged by [CONTACT_2413] . 
5. Smoking history of an average of at least [ADDRESS_1107998] (i.e., not slim) king size combustible cigarettes daily for at least 1 year prior to 
Screening. Brief periods (i.e., up to 7 consecu tive days) of non -smoking during the 3 
months prior to Screening (e.g., due to illness or participation in a study where smoking 
was prohibited) will be permitted.  
6. Self-reporting of desire to smoke within approximately 30 minutes of waking.  
7. Positive urine cotinine (≥500 ng/mL) at Screening.  
8. Negative pregnancy test at Screening and Day -1 (check -in) for all female subjects.  
9. Female subjects of non -childbearing potential must be surgically sterile or 1 year 
postmenopausal (as confirmed by [CONTACT_802745] [FSH] > 35 U/L). A 
subject is considered to be surgically sterile if she has had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oopherectomy or bilateral oopherectomy, or hysterectomy with bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oopherectomy. If the subject i s of childbearing potential, she must be using a 
medically accepted method of contraception and agree to continued use of this method for 
the duration of the study and for 30 days after completion of the study. Acceptable methods 
of contraception include a bstinence, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], or an intrauterine device (known to 
have a failure rate of less than 1% per year) or double barrier method of contraception 
(e.g., male condom in addition to a diaphragm, contraceptive sponge or spermicide).  
10. Able to speak, re ad, and understand English sufficiently to allow completion of all study 
assessments.  
11. Must be willing to comply with the requirements and restrictions of the study.

time for any reason.   
A subject may also be dis continued from the study, at the discretion of an investigator  and/or 
sponsor, for any of the following  reasons :  
▪ Entere d the study in violation of the  protocol;  
▪ Safety reasons, including AEs; 
▪ Use of unacceptable concomitant medication (s); 
▪ Non-compliance o r major protocol violation ; 
▪ It is not considered i n the best interest of the subject to continue;  
▪ Pregnancy;  
▪ Positive UDS  or alcohol test;   
▪ Administrative reasons (e.g., termination  of enrollment or study) ; 
▪ Difficulties with blood collection . 
An investigator  must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior to 
completion; the reason(s) for study discontinuation will be documented. In the event that a 
subject chooses to withdraw from the study, an investigator  should make a reasonable attempt to 
obtain and record the reason(s) for withdrawal, if possible, although the subject is not obligated 
to provide such a reason.  
In the event that a subject is discontinued while at the clinical site, the early termination 
procedures s hown in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1) should  be performed prior to 
discharge from the study site. For any case of early discontinuation (wheth er or not the subject is 
at the clinical site),  an investigator  should ask the subject to return to complete the end  of study  
procedures, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent for those procedures. If a  
subject refuses to complete early termi nation procedures and /or the End of Study  Phase , this 
information will be recorded .

[IP_ADDRESS].  Product A: VL N Menthol Cigarettes  
During the first product use session (i.e., Controlled Use), subjects will take [ADDRESS_1108011] menthol cigarettes at approximately 30 -second intervals  (± 5 seconds) based off the 
start of inhalation , inhalation duration  will not exceed 3  ± 2 second s per puff . The clinic staff will 
indicate to the subjects when to start each inhalation at each 30 -second interval, will document 
the total number of inhalations (if less than 10) and any reasons for missed inhalations.  During  
the second product use session (i.e., uncontrolled use), subjects will smoke one VLN  menthol  
cigarette ad libitum for 10 minutes and the clinic  staff will document the total number of 
inhalations and the duration of inhalations.  The used butts may be disc arded after adequate 
accountability has been completed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Product B: Own -brand Menthol Cigarettes  
During the first product use session (i.e., Controlled Use), subjects will take 10 puffs of one of 
their own -brand menthol cigarettes at approximately 30 -second intervals (± 5 seconds) based off 
the start of inhalation, inhalation duration will not exceed 3 ± 2 seconds per puff . The clinic staff 
will indicate to the subjects when to start each inhalation at each 30 -second interval, will 
document the total number of inhalations  (if less than 10) and  any reasons for missed inhalations. 
During the second product use session (i.e., Uncontrolled U se), subjects will smoke one own -
brand menthol cigarette ad libitum for 10 minutes and the clinic staff will document the total 
number of inhalations and the duration of inhalations . The used butts may be discarded after

9.7. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications, including prescription, over -the-counter, or herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_802733] s 
will be documented for the 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study. An investigator  
will determine if the prior/concomitant medication(s) affect the subject ’s eligibility to participate 
or continue to participate in the study.  
On a case -by-case basis, an investigator  is permitted to allow the use of some concomitant 
medicatio ns, for example, to treat an AE, as long as an investigator  determines that the 
medication will not affect the subject’s safety or study integrity (e.g., topi[INVESTIGATOR_5910]).  
Wherever possible, an investigator  should obtain approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor 
prior to administering the medication.  Stable doses ( i.e., no dosage adjustments within 30 days 
prior to Day -1) of prescription or over -the-counter medications required to treat an investigator -
approved disease or condition will be permitt ed at the discretion of an investigator .

 10. STUDY PROCEDURES AND  ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be p erformed at the visits and time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Table  1); the following sections outline the details and procedures associated with 
the assessments.  Other logistical considerations (e.g., sequence of events, assessment windows) 
will be outlined in study -specific procedures.   
10.1. Demographics  and Other Ba seline Characteristics  
10.1.1.  Informed  Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by [CONTACT_802747] . The subject  must provide written informed consent 
on an ethics -approved informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any study -related 
procedures. A copy of the ICF will be provided to the subject.  
10.1.2.  Demographics  
The following demographics will be recorded: age (birthdate),  sex, race, and ethnicity.   
10.1.3.  Medical History  
The c omplete medical history will include histories of acute, chronic, or infectious disease; 
surgical or oncologic histories; and any reported conditions affecting major body systems. All 
findings o n medical history will be evaluated by [CONTACT_802748]. Medical 
histories will be obtained according to the site ’s standard operating procedures.  
10.1.4.  Medication  and Smoking History  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription, herbal medications/natural health products, 
or investigational drugs) taken by [CONTACT_12539] 30 days prior to Screening will be 
recorded in the source documentation as medication history.   
A history of  tobacco use/history and smoking history will  be recorded for each subject.  
DSM -IV-TR modules will be included as a part of the recreational drug/alcohol use history and 
used to screen for alcohol and substance dependence.  
10.2. Pharmacodynamic Measures  
On Day -1, subjects will complete a training session  during which they will complete  the 
subjective questionnaires in order to familiarize themselves with the questions, appropriate use 
of the V AS, and use of the computerized tablet system.  
10.2.1.  Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal Scale  
The Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal i tems are administered as 100 point V AS, and are intended to 
measure withdrawal symptoms and craving  (adapted from Hughes & Hatsukami , 1986 ; 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 36 of 62  
 Appendix  17.2.1 ). The VAS is anchored with “Not at All” on the left and “Extremely ” on the 
right. The questionnaire items are as follows:  
1. Urges to Smoke  
2. Anxious  
3. Difficulty Concentrating  
4. Impatient  
5. Craving a Cigarette  
10.2.2.  Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire  
The Direct Effects of Product items are administered as [ADDRESS_1108016] being sampled at the moment  (Appendix 17.2.2 ). The V AS is 
anchored with “Not at All” on the left and “Extremely ” on the right. The questionnaire items are 
as follows:  
1. Is the product “Pleasant ” right now?  
2. Is the product “Satisfying ” right now ? 
3. Is the product making you feel “Calm ” right now ? 
4. Is the product helpi[INVESTIGATOR_56109] “Concentrate ” right now ? 
5. Is the product making you feel more “Awake ” right now ? 
6. Is the product making you feel “Sick” right now?  
7. Is the product reducing you r “Hunger ” for food right now?  
8. Would you like “More ” of the product right now?  
Items are  selected based on measures of product effec ts used in previous trials with tobacco 
products  and conventional cigarettes  (Hanson, Connor &  Hatsukami 2009 ).  
10.2.3.  Use the Product Again Questionnaire  
The Use the Product Again questionnaire is a bipolar [ADDRESS_1108017] again  (Appendix 17.2.3 ). The V AS is 
anchored by “Definitely Would Not” on the left and “Definitely Would” on the right; t he neutral 
point is also labeled with an anchor (“Don’t Care”). The VAS is adapted from the Take Drug 
Again V AS administered in human abuse potential studies of pharmaceutical products  (Griffiths, 
Bigelow  & Ator, 2003 ).  
10.2.4.  Product Use  
Number of own -brand menthol cigarettes and VLN menthol cigarettes smoked  and number of 
nicotine polacrilex gum pi[INVESTIGATOR_802734] A.  During the Uncontrolled Use Sessions in Part B,

 10.3. Safety Assessments  
10.3.1.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An investigator  and research site staff are responsible for the detection, documentation, 
classification, reporting, and follow -up of events meeting the definition of an AE or serious 
adverse event (SAE). All AEs will be recorded following informed consent (at Screening) until 
the End of Study (or the required follow up period for a specific AE or SAE) .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product and may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the administered treatment. An 
AE can , therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not relat ed to the investigational product. During the study, 
an AE can also occur outside the time that the investigational product(s) was given (e.g., during a 
washout period). Pre -existing conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless 
there is  a change in intensity, frequency, or quality.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any product use : 
▪ Results in death;  
▪ Is life -threatening (at the time of the event);  
▪ Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
▪ Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
▪ Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or requi re 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse product  experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the def inition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in 
the risk information generally known for nicotine gum and cigarettes.  
Any SAE —expected or unexpected, irrespective of relationship to study treat ments, including 
death due to any cause —experienced by a study subject  will be reported  to 22nd Century Inc. or 
designee by [CONTACT_802749] 24 hours of learning of the event. Information regarding the 
SAE will be transmitted to 22nd Century Inc. or designee, as follows:

Williamsville, NY [ZIP_CODE]  
Email:[EMAIL_15249]  
 
22nd  Century Inc. or designee assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the 
regulatory authorities. 22nd Century Inc. or designee will also report to an investigator all SAEs 
that are unlisted and associated with product use . The investigator (or 22nd  Century Inc. , where 
required) must report these events to the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) that 
approved the protocol (unless otherwise required and documented by [CONTACT_1201]). Follow -up 
evaluations for SAEs will also be reported to 22nd Centu ry Inc. or designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
Abnormal clinical laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) or 
other abnormal assessments (e.g., from vital signs or ECG), judged as clini cally significant by [CONTACT_802750], if they meet the definitions provided previously. 
Abnormal laboratory or other findings present at baseline that significantly worsen following the 
start of the study will be reported as  AEs or SAEs. However, abnormal findings present at the 
start of the study that do not worsen will not be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless an investigator  
or designee judges them as more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Classification of A dverse Event Intensity and Causality  
For each recorded AE or SAE, an investigator must make an assessment of intensity based on the 
following criteria:  
Mild:  An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervent ion. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate:  An event that is alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to 
the subject . 
Severe:   An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical 
status. The event poses a significan t risk of harm to the subject  and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481911].  
An investigator  must make an assessment of causality based on the following criteria to 
determine the relationship between the AE/SAE and study product : 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 39 of 62  
 Unrelated:  Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes (e.g., disease, 
environment, etc.) and does not meet the criteria for study product  
relationship listed under probable, possible, or unlikely.  
Unlikely:  ▪ Does not follow a reasonable temporal seque nce from 
administration of the study product ;  
▪ May readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ;  
▪ Does not follow a known pattern of response to the study  product ;  
▪ Does not reappear or worsen when the product is used again . 
Possible:  The connection to the product  appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with 
certainty:  
▪ Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study product ; 
▪ May ha ve been produced by [CONTACT_423] ’s clinical state, 
environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; 
▪ Follows a pattern of r esponse to the suspected study product . 
Probable:  The connection to the product  can be made with a high degree of certainty:  
▪ Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study product ; 
▪ Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_78456] ’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject ;  
▪ Disappears or decreases upon cessation or reduction in use of the 
product  (note that there are important exceptions when an AE or 
SAE does not disappear upon discontinuation of use the study 
product, yet  relatedness to study product clearly exists, e.g., bone 
marrow depression or tardive dyskinesias);  
▪ Follows a known pattern of response to the study product ; 
▪ Reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All unresol ved AEs will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1108019] ’s final Study 
Day, unless an investigator ’s judgment dictates otherwise, the event has resolved or stabilized 
before the [ADDRESS_1108020] to follow -up.  
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 40 of 62  
 All AEs that result in discontinuation and SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, 
stabilizes (according to the judgment of an investigator ), returns to a baseline value (if a baseline 
value is available), or can be attributed to agents other than the study product  or to factors 
unrelated to study conduct.  
When it becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (e.g., subject  or health 
care practitioner refuses to provide additional information, the subject  is lost to follow -up), an 
investigator  or designee will ensure that the follow -up includes any pertinent supplemental 
investigations (e.g., laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or 
consultation with other health care professionals) to elucidate the nat ure and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subject s that occur 
following the AE or SAE Follow -up period. However, if an investigator  learns of any AE or SAE 
at any time after a subjec t has been discharged from the study and the event is considered as 
reasonably related to the study product , an investigator  will notify 22nd  Century Inc . 
For each recorded AE or SAE, an investigator  must make an assessment of outcome at the time 
of last observation, as follows:  
Fatal:  The subject  died.  
Resolved  The AE or SAE has ended.  
Resolved with 
Sequelae  The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted from baseline.  
Unresolved – 
Ongoing:  The AE  or SAE  has not ended and is ongoing at the end of the 
reporting period (i.e., 14 days after the final Study Day ) and an 
investigator  deems that further follow up is not medically required  
Unresolved – Lost to 
Follow:  Lost to follow -up after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact [CONTACT_1560] . 
10.3.2.  Pregnancy  
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the study or for [ADDRESS_1108021]  who becomes pregnant during  the study will be immediately 
withdrawn from the study.  
Follow -up information will be obtained where possible (with the consent of the subject  or their 
partner) regarding the course and outcome of the pregnancy, including any pos t-natal sequelae in 
the infant . 
10.3.3.  Clinical Laboratory  Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected, processed, and shipped according to the research 
site’s standard operating proced ures and instructions from the saf ety laboratory. Samples will be

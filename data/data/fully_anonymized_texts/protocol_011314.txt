Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments  
Primary Efficacy Assessment  
 Modified  Static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA -G) 
Additional Efficacy Assessments  
 Static Physician Global Assessme nt (sPGA)  
 Body Surface Area (BSA)  
 Genital Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS)  
 Genital Psoriasis Itch Numeric Rating Scale (GPI -NRS)  
 Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
Overview of Key Safety Assessments  
Safety assessments will include:  
 Adverse events  
 Vital signs  
 Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential (FCBP)  
 Clinical laboratory tests  
Statistical Methods  
It is assumed that modified  sPGA -G response will be similar to historic sPGA response. With a 
total of approximately 286 subjects and a randomization ratio of 1:1, Study PSOR -[ADDRESS_611765] (APR) 30 BID and 143 subjects to placebo. 
This sample size will provide 85 power to detect a treatment difference of 15  at Week 16 
(25 for APR 30 BID and 10  for placebo) for the primary endpoint using a chi -square test at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 after adjusting for a 20  dropout rate.  
The analyses of efficacy endpoints will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, defined 
as all subjects who are randomized . Statistical comparisons will be made between APR 30  BID 
and placebo for the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16). All statistical tests will be at the 
2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_611766]  
Protocol CC -[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025  [COMPANY_010] Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  8 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  The treatment difference for the primary endpoint will be compared betw een APR 30 BID and 
placebo using a Cochran Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the stratification factor. The 
2-sided p -values from the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the 
weighted average of the treatment differences a cross the stratification factor with the CMH 
weights, along with the associated 2 -sided 95 confidence intervals (CIs) using a normal 
approximation to the weighted average will be provided. Missing values at Week 16 will be 
imputed using multiple imputatio n (MI) as the primary method, with sensitivity analysis using 
the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method.  
The continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) as the primary method. The MMRM model will use the cha nge or percent change 
from baseline as the response variable and include treatment group, visit time, treatment -by-time 
interaction, and stratification factor as fixed effects, and the baseline value as a covariate. An 
unstructured covariance matrix will b e used to model the correlation among repeated 
measurements. The Kenward -Roger adjustment will be used with restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) to make proper statistical inference. Within -group least -squares (LS) means and the 
associated standard errors (SEs) and 2 -sided 95 CIs, treatment differences in LS means and the 
associated 2 -sided 95 CIs and 2 -sided p -values will be derived from the MMRM model. A 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatmen t and stratification factor as the fixed effects, the baseline value as the covariate and the 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) method to impute the missing data at Week 16.  
The other binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoi nt using the CMH 
test.  
To control the overall type I error rate, a fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used to test the 
primary and secondary endpoints in a predefined order. The test will be performed in sequence 
and significance of all preceding endpoints is required in order to proceed to the next one. The 
proposed sequence of testing for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints is specified in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population, defined as all subjects who 
are randomized and receive at least one dose of inves tigational product. Safety will be assesse d 
by [CONTACT_477052] -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs; no inferential testing for statistical significance will be 
performed.  
Adverse events will be classified using the Medic al Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term, severity and relationship to investigational product. TEAEs leading to death or to 
discontinuation from treatment an d serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized and listed 
separately.  
Data from other safety assessments will be summarized descriptively. Shift tables for laboratory 
parameters showing the number of subjects with values low, normal, and high comparing  with 
the normal reference ranges pre -treatment versus post treatment will be provided.  
To account for the different exposure to the investigational product, AEs or marked laboratory 
abnormalities will also be summarized using the exposure adjusted inciden ce rate, in addition to 
the simple incidence rates.

1.1. Disease Background  
Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, immunological disease involving the skin and/or joints that may 
profoundly affect quality of life and result in a significant socioeconomic burden (World Health 
Organization [ WHO] Global Report on Psoriasis, 2016; Van Voorhees, 2016 ). Genital psoriasis, 
defined as psoriasis in the peri -vaginal region, penis, scrotum and perineum ( Menter, 2018 ) has 
been reported as the most stigmatizing form of psoriasis, regardless of overall disease severity 
(Schmid -Ott, 1999 ).  Genital involvement has been shown to have a profound impact on quality 
of life and sexua l health ( Meeuwis, 2011 ; Meeuwis, 2015 ; Ryan,  2015 ).  In addition, patients 
with genital psoriasis report high levels of itching, pain and discomfort ( Meeuwis, 2011 ; Ryan, 
2015 ). 
Involvement of genital skin has been reported to occur in 29 -46 of psoriasis patients 
(Meeuwis,  2015 ), but underreporting of genital skin involvement has been a concern.  In an 
observational, mu lticenter study of 354 consecutive psoriasis patients by [INVESTIGATOR_88342] (2015) , 63 of 
patients reported genital involvement currently and/or previously during the course of their 
disease.  
Genital psoriasis is characterized as plaque psoriasi s, although lesions may differ in appearance 
from those in other body areas.  Genital plaques are more likely to be thinner and less scaly than 
psoriatic plaques located elsewhere ( Menter, 2008 ; Papp, 2009 ; Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products 
Indicated for the Treatment of Psoriasis, 2005 ).   Local conditions in the genital area such as 
warmth, moisture and frictio n from clothing may lead to maceration, fissuring and chafing, and 
may impede both accurate diagnosis and treatment as well as healing ( Guglielmetti, 2012 ).   
1.2. Compound Background  
Apremilast (CC -[ZIP_CODE]) is a specific phosphodiesterase  type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under 
development for use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.  The PDE4 is one of the major 
phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocytes. PDE4 inhibition by [CONTACT_477053] (cAMP) levels in  immune cells, which in turn down -regulates the 
inflammatory response by [CONTACT_394815] -inflammatory mediators such as tumor 
necrosing factor (TNF) , interleukin (IL) -23, IL -17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and 
increasing the producti on of anti -inflammatory mediators.  
In completed Phase [ADDRESS_611781] (OTEZLA) is approved in approximately [ADDRESS_611782] 
is also approved in several countries for the treatment of adult patients with oral ulcers 
associated with Behçet’s disease.

Confidential and Proprietary  16 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  [ADDRESS_611783] remains under further c linical development for the treatment of inflammatory/ 
autoimmune disorders. Further studies within the approved indications of plaque psoriasis, 
psoriatic arthritis, and Behçet’s disease  are also ongoing.  
Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochur e (IB) for detailed information concerning the 
available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) 
profile of the investigational product (IP).  
1.3. Rationale  
1.3.1.  Study Rationale and Purpose  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_477030]. However, topi[INVESTIGATOR_477031], poor treatment compliance, limited efficacy and 
significant adverse effects such as tachyphylaxis, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal (HPA) axis suppression ( Chan, 2009 ; Kragballe, 2013 ).  
Evaluation of systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477032] 
(Guglielmetti,  2012 ; Meeuwis 2015 ).  To date only the IL -17 inhibitor ixekizumab has 
demonstrated both dermatologic and psychosocial improvements in patients with moderate to 
severe genital psoriasis ( Ryan, 2017 ; Cather, 2018 ).  Other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_477033].  
Therefore, the benefit -risk profile of these agents in patients with genital psoriasis ha s not been 
well defined.  
There remains an unmet medical need for an effective, convenient treatment for moderate to 
severe genital psoriasis that is well tolerated compared to the currently available treatment 
options.   
Apremilast (APR, OTEZLA) is a dru g that is taken orally (by [CONTACT_1966] [PO]).  Apremilast inhibits 
the enzyme PDE4, which is a cAMP -specific PDE and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells.  
By [CONTACT_459248]4, apremilast elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn modulates a 
network of pro- and anti -inflammatory mediators and reduces the inflammatory response.  
Evaluation of apremilast in a randomized clinical study of genital psoriasis will provide robust 
analysis of the benefit -risk of a systemic therapy in this difficult to treat popu lation. Apremilast 
may offer patients with moderate to severe genital psoriasis an effective oral therapy with a 
novel mechanism of action and a favorable safety profile.  
1.3.2.  Rationale for the Study Design  
This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo -control led, double -blind study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -[ZIP_CODE]) in subjects with moderate to severe 
genital psoriasis,  who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588]. The 
enrolled adult subjects will have a  modified  static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia 
(sPGA -G) score of  3 (moderate or severe) and evidence of plaque psoriasis (Body Surface 
Area [BSA]  1) in a non -genital region and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA)  3 
(moderate o r severe).  This is a [ADDRESS_611784] 
(APR) 30 twice daily (BID).  The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a modified  
Apremilast  
Protocol CC -[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025  [COMPANY_010] Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  17 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  sPGA -G score of 0 (clear) or 1 ( almost clear ) with at least a [ADDRESS_611785] 
been demonstrated across multiple cl inical trials.  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies (PSOR -008 and 
PSOR -009), significant improvement in difficult to treat areas of psoriasis such as nail, scalp and 
palmoplantar were observed in subjects treated with apremilast, however, genital manifestations  
were not assessed in these trials.  Study PSOR -[ADDRESS_611786] in the treatment of moderate to severe genital psoriasis.   
The sample size estimation of approximately 286 subjects with a randomization ratio of 1:[ADDRESS_611787] 6 months  
duration, and evidence of plaque psoriasis BSA  1 in a non -genital region and sPGA  3 
(moderate or severe) .  Subjects will have moderate or severe genital psoriasis with a  modified  
sPGA -G score of  3 (moderate or severe), who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588].  Prior treatment for psoriasis will be stopped for specified durations before 
randomization as follows: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_477034] [ADDRESS_611788] 24 weeks before randomization, 
and no concomitant psoriasis therapy (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], photo or systemic ) will be permitted during the 
active treatment period of the study (except for a non -medicated moisturizer such as Eucerin or 
non-medicated shampoo).  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with a modified sPGA -G score of 0 
(clear) or 1 ( almost clear ) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline  at Week 16. Based on 
health authority feedback, the sPGA -G described by [CONTACT_477054] a 6 -point to 
a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).  The modified  sPGA -G score incorporates an 
assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque  
elevation at a given time point, and was developed as an efficacy outcome measure in the clinical 
assessment of the severity of genital psorias is, based on sPGA scales used in clinical studies 
(Merola, 2017 ; Menter, 2018 ).  Assessment of sPGA -G response was the primary endpoint in a 
recent ixekizumab genital psoriasis study ( Cather, 2018 ).  
In the proposed study population of subjects with a baseline of modified  sPGA -G of  3 
(moderate or severe), who are inadequately controlled with or intolerant of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588]. 
[COMPANY_010]  believes that achieving a modified  sPGA -G score of clear (0) or almost clear  (1) with at 
least a 2 -point reduction from baseline  at Week 16 will represent a clinically meaningful benefit 
in subjects with limited treatment options.   
Further supporting the decision to use modified sPGA -G, the CHMP Guidelines (2005 ) 
recognize that Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) has not been adapted for difficult to 
treat manifestations of psoriasis such as the scalp or in the genital region and recommend the use 
of a PGA to assess efficacy.  Similar to the development of a Scalp Physician Global Assessment 
(ScPGA), the modified sPGA -G serves as a clinical outcome measure of severity in genital 
psoriasis.

Confidential and Proprietary  18 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  Study PSOR -025 will enroll subjects with total body plaque psoriasis ranging in  skin 
involvement (BSA  1).  Unlike the PASI scoring system, modified sPGA -G is not limited by 
a decrease in sensitivity in less extensive disease.  Stratification by [CONTACT_22803] -affected BSA will 
be performed (BSA  10 or  10) and the strata with BSA  10 will take  40 of the 
total enrollment  to allow an assessment of efficacy in subjects with greater or lesser overall skin 
involvement.   
The first secondary endpoint will be proportion of subjects achieving an overall sPGA score of 
clear (0) or almos t clear  (1) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline .  
Other secondary endpoints of response will include the proportion of subjects with a 4 -point 
reduction (improvement) from baseline in the Genital Psoriasis Itch Numeric Rating Scale  
(GPI -NRS) sc ore at Week 16.  The GPI -NRS is one of eight components of the validated Genital 
Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS) which was developed to assess symptoms that are particularly 
burdensome to subjects with genital psoriasis ( Gottlieb, 20 18).  The GPSS was modeled after the 
Whole Body Itch numeric rating scale (NRS) instrument, which has been previously validated in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( Naegeli, 2015 ).  While all eight components 
of the GPSS and total symptoms score will be included as a secondary endpoint, the significant 
impact of itch on quality of life in subjects with genital psoriasis warrants additional attention.  
Pruritus is a common and frequently reported symptom of plaque psor iasis, occurring on a daily 
basis in 77  of subjects with extensive psoriasis ( Yosipovitch, 2000 ).  In an observational, 
multicenter study of 354 subjects with current and/or previous genital psoriasis, itch was reported 
by 86 of pa rticipants ( Ryan, 2015 ).  In study PSOR -025, assessment of genital itch will be 
conducted from baseline (Visit 2) through the Apremilast Extension Phase. In addition to 
GPI-NRS, change from baseline in affected BSA, change from basel ine in Dermatology Life 
Quality Index ( DLQI) total score, and change from baseline in GPSS total score and individual 
items scores will be assessed at Week 16.  
1.3.3.  Rationale for Dose, Schedule and Regimen Selection  
In a Phase 2 dose finding study (CC -[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR-005), a clear dose response was demonstrated 
with statistically significant improvement in apremilast [ADDRESS_611789] 30 mg BID dose was evaluated in two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies 
(studies CC -[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -008 and CC -[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -009) and was subsequently approved for 
use in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for 
phototherapy or systemic therapy.   Since the outcome of apremilast treatment on genital psoriasis 
has not been evaluated previously, this study will directly investigate the safety an d efficacy of 
this dosing regimen in the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe genital psoriasis.  
1.3.4.  Rationale for Choice of Comparator Compounds  
A randomized, double -blind placebo -controlled design was chosen in order to measure the 
absolute treatment effect of apremilast [ADDRESS_611790] in the selected patient population (Food and D rug Administration [FDA] 
Guidance for Industry E10).

Protocol CC -[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025  [COMPANY_010] Inc.  
Confidential and Proprietary  19 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  1.3.5.  Rationale for Pharmacodynamics and Potential Predictive Biomarkers  
Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is the predominant cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -
selective phosphodiesterase that regulates intracell ular cAMP levels and gene expression in cells 
of the immune system. PDE4 is highly overexpressed in the peripheral blood of a subset of 
psoriasis subjects ( Schafer, 2016 ). Apremilast has been found to reduce Th17 and Th22 cytok ine 
expression in the lesional skin and peripheral blood of psoriasis subjects ( Gottlieb, 2013; 
Krueger, 2016 ). In subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis, treatment with apremilast is 
associated with significant reductions in plasma levels of interleukin (IL) -17F, IL -17A, IL -22, 
and tumor necrosis factor - (TNF -) compared with placebo as early as Week 4; decreases in 
cytokine levels were sustained with continued treatment. These in vitro and clinical data 
demonstrate that t he beneficial effects of apremilast on known inflammatory mediators are 
associated with its clinical efficacy. However, the efficacy of apremilast has not yet been tested 
in the moderate to severe genital psoriasis population, and predictors of clinical re sponse to 
apremilast have not yet been identified.  
 
 These data will define the mechanism of action o f apremilast in subjects with moderate to 
severe genital psoriasis and may inform on the subset of subjects who are responding well to 
apremilast treatment.  
Psoriasis is driven in part by [INVESTIGATOR_78942], including HLA -Cw6, TNF -, LCE3B/3C, IL12B, 
IL23A, I L23R, LCE, TNIP1, IFHIH1, and NFKBIA. Apremilast has been shown to inhibit the 
expression of some of these genes, including TNF -, IL12B, and IL23A ( Gottlieb, 2013 ). 
Therefore, clinical response to apremilast may be dependent upon the underlying genetic drivers 
in some psoriasis subjects.

6.4. Efficacy Assessments   
 Modified static Physician Global Assessment of Genitalia (sPGA -G) 
The modified sPG A-G is the assessment by [CONTACT_477061]’s psoriasis 
lesions’ overall severity in the genital area (labia majora, labia minora, and perineum 
in females; penis, scrotum, and perineum in males) at the time of evaluation. The 
modified sPGA -G is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), 
incorporating an assessment of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: 
erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling. It is not necessary that all 3 criteria be 
fulfilled. The sPGA of Genitalia score is based on a combina tion of erythema and the 
second ary features (plaque elevation and/o r scale).  Since  erythema is the most robust 
finding, it should be the dominant feature influencing the sPGA of Genitalia rating in 
the majori ty of cases ( Merola, 2017 ). See Appendix  A for grading criteria.  
 static Physician Global Assessm ent (sPGA)  
The sPGA is the assessment by [CONTACT_477062].  The sPGA is a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), 
incorporating an assessment of the severity of the three primary signs o f the disease: 
erythema, scaling and plaque elevation.  When making the assessment of overall 
severity, the investigator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, 
have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesions for severity, ie, the severity 
of each sign is averaged across all areas of involvement, including cleared lesions.

Confidential and Proprietary  35 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021  In the event of different severities across disease signs, the sign that is the 
predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score.  
See (Appendix  B) for grading criteria .  
 Body Surface Area (BSA)  
Body surface area is a measuremen t of involved skin over the whole body.  The 
overall BSA affected by [CONTACT_477063]’s 
hand.  The surface area of the whole body is made up of approximately 100 palms or 
“handprints” (each entire palmar surface or “handprint” equates to approximately 1  
of total body surface area).  
6.5. Safety Assessments  
 Contraception Education  
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time.  
Results of animal and in vitro studies can be found i n the current IB.  
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved 
contraceptive options as described in Section 4.[ADDRESS_611814]’s chosen form of 
contraception must be effective by [CONTACT_477064] (for example, hormonal contraception should be initiated at least 28 days before 
randomization).  
At screening and at baseline, and at any time during the study when a female subject 
of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures  or ability to become pregnant 
changes, the investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and 
correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy.  
 Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential 
(FCBP)  
A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of  25 mIU/mL will be required for FCBP 
subjects at screening and at the Early Termination Visit or Visit 10.  In addition, a 
local urine pregnancy test kit will be pro vided by [CONTACT_477065], prior to dosing. An 
unscheduled serum pregnancy test should be performed if the FCBP subject has 
missed a menstrual period or has a positive urine  dipstick test.  
 Hepatitis B and C  
Hepatitis testing will include hepatitis B surface antigen and anti -hepatitis C antibody.  
 Vital Signs, Height, and Weight  
Vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be taken 
during the visit s indicated in Table 3.  Height will be measured and recorded at 
Screening; weight will also be measured a nd recorded at screening and then as 
indicated in Table 3. Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated at Scre ening.

Confidential and Proprietary  36 CC-[ZIP_CODE] -PSOR -025 Amendment 3.0 Final:  03 March 2021   Complete Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination includes evaluations of skin, nasal cavities, eyes, 
ears, lymph nodes, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and 
musculoskeletal systems.  The complete physical  examination is done at screening 
and at the Early Termination or Last Treatment Visit (Visit 10).  
 Psychiatric Evaluation  
Apremilast prescriber information (eg, Summary of Product Characteristics, Package 
Insert) includes a warning regarding depression and  suicidal thoughts. Patients with 
chronic diseases may be prone to depression. The risks and benefits of starting or 
continuing treatment with apremilast should be carefully assessed if patients report 
previous or existing psychiatric symptoms or if concom itant treatment with other 
medicinal products likely to cause psychiatric events is intended. At any time during 
the study (post -randomization), subjects who have suicidal thoughts or behavior 
should be evaluated.  If the psychiatrist deems the subject not  to be a risk for suicide, 
the subject may remain in the study, but if a risk of suicide is confirmed, the subject 
must be discontinued from the study.   If the subject is discontinued, the subject 
should return for the Observational Follow -up Visit.  
A copy  of the psychiatric evaluation report must be in the subject’s source 
documentation, especially if the subject is confirmed not to be at risk for suicide and 
is continuing in the study.  
 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed by a central laboratory and as 
indicated in Table 3.  Clinical laboratory evaluations include complete blood count 
(red blood cell [RBC] count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count 
and differential, absolute WBC counts, platelet count); serum chemistries (total 
protein, albumin, calcium, phosphor ous, glucose, total cholesterol [TC], triglycerides, 
high-density lipoprotein [HDL], high -density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C], 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL -C], uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase [AS T; serum glutamic -oxaloacetic 
transaminase, SGOT], alanine aminotransferase [ ALT; serum glutamic pyruvic 
transaminase, SGPT ], sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate [carbon dioxide, 
CO 2], blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] , and 
magnesium); as well as dipstick urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, 
protein, blood, bilirubin, leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and urobilinogen).  Dipstick 
urinalysis will be performed by [CONTACT_2237]; microscopic urinalysis 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_265731], RBC, WBC, and casts) will be performed only if the dipstick 
urinalysis is abnormal.  
Fasting is not required.  However, if significant elevation of serum lipid(s) is 
observed, a fasting retest should be requested to determine whether or not eleva tion 
was caused by [CONTACT_188103].

6.7.1.  Genital Psoriasis Symptoms Scale (GPSS)  
The GPSS is a patien t-administered assessment of  8 symptoms:  itch, pain, 
discomfort, stinging, burning,  redness , scalin g, and cracking.  Respondents are asked 
to answer the questions based on their psoriasis sympto ms in the genital area.   
Numeric rating  scales (NRS)  are used to assess the sel f-reported overall severi ty of 
each of the 8  sympto ms individually  in the genital area on  an 11-point horizonta l 
scale  anchored  at 0 (no) and 10 (worst  imaginable ).  The overal l severi ty for each 
individual symptom from  patient's genita l psoriasis is indicated by  [CONTACT_477066] [ADDRESS_611816] 24 hours. The symptom severi ty scores, ranging fr om 0 to 10, are the 
values of the selected numbe rs indicated by  [CONTACT_477067]’s horizontal 
scale.  Each of the  8 individual items will receive a score of 0 to 10 and will be 
reported as  item score s for itch, pain, discomfort, stinging, burning, redness, scaling, 
and cracking.  In addi tion, a total score ranging  from 0 (no genital psoriasis 
symptoms) to 80 (worst imaginable genital psoriasis symptoms) will be reported 
(Gottlieb, 2018 ). See (Appendix  D). 
6.7.2.  Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The DLQI was developed as a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in 
a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related t o the impact of skin 
disease ( Finlay, 1994 ).  The instrument contains [ADDRESS_611817]’s 
skin.  With the exception of Item Number 7, the subject responds on a four -point 
scale, ranging from “Very Much” to “Not at All.”  Item Number [ADDRESS_611818]’s skin prevented them from 
working or studying (Yes or No), and if “No,” then the subject is asked how much of 
a problem the skin has been at work or study  over the past week, with response 
alternatives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all.”   
The DLQI total score has a possible range from [ADDRESS_611819] that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and 
feelings; daily activities; leisure; work/school; personal relationships; and treatment.  
Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisu re, and

will be implemented in this study.  During Week 0 (Days 1-7) and Week 16 (when placebo 
subjects are switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID), subjects will be dispensed blister cards 
with 10, 20, and [ADDRESS_611830](s) only.  Therefore, for a drug to be subject to the overdose definition it must be both 
required and an  investigational drug.  In this study, the only required and investigational drug is 
apremilast and the control arm drug (ie, placebo); hence, overdose definition will apply to only 
apremilast (or matching placebo).  Other required or optional non -IP inten ded for prophylaxis of 
certain side effects, etc., are excluded from this definition.  
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of [ADDRESS_611831] (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24 -hour period whether by [CONTACT_477068]. On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4

7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment  
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized using a permuted block 
randomization in parallel 1:[ADDRESS_611832] 30 mg BID or placebo, using a 
centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT).  Randomization to apremilast arm or 
placebo arm will be stratified by [CONTACT_477055] -involved body surface  area (BSA) (  10 or 
 10). No more than 60 of subjects with BSA  10 will be enrolled.  Designated research 
personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned password protected, coded identification 
numbers, which gives them authorization to enter the IRT to randomize subjects.   
The system will present a menu of questions by [CONTACT_477069]. When all questions have been answered and the subject 
deemed eligible, the IRT will assign a randomization identification number.   
Confirmation of the randomization will be sent  to the investigational site, [COMPANY_010] , and/or its 
representative. The confirmation reports should be maintained as source documents.  During the 
study visits, the pharmacy or authorized study personnel at the investigational site will dispense 
coded IP kits in accordance with the randomization number assigned by [CONTACT_6606].

7.7. Investigational Product Compliance  
Study personnel will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subjects prior 
to dispensing the IP.  Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events, 
Table 3.  The subjects will be instructed to return the IP containers, including any unused 
medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet counts and reconciliation as indicated in the 
Table of Events, Table 3.  Subjects will be asked whether they have taken their IP as instructed at 
each study visit.  Any problems with IP compliance will be reviewed with the subject.  If a 
subject misses [ADDRESS_611834] should be terminated from the Treatment 
Phase of the study and enter into the Observational Follow -up Phase.  
Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive day s of dosing or taking less 
than 75 of the doses between study visits) are protocol deviations and should be discussed with 
[COMPANY_010] .  Overall compliance with the study treatment regimen is defined as taking between 75  
and 120 of the expected doses during a  subject’s participation while in the treatment phases

8.2. Concomitant Medications Not Recommended  
Co-administration of the strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme  inducer, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
resulted in a reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy 
of apremilast. Therefore, the use of strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (eg, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
phenobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin and St. Joh n’s Wort) with apremilast is not 
recommended during the study.

psoriasis (modified sPGA -G  3, moderate or severe) . Treatment assignment will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_477055] -involved body surface area (BSA) (  10 or  10). No more than 60 of 
subjects with BSA   10 will be enrolled.  
The objective of the statistical analysis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast [ADDRESS_611837] completed the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the primary 
analysis will be perfor med.  At the study completion, ie, when all subjects have also completed 
the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) and the Observational Follow -up Phase, the 
final analysis will be performed. To maintain the blind at the site and subject level, the i ndividual 
subject treatment assignments will not be revealed to the investigators until after the final 
database lock following the study completion.  
9.2. Study Population Definitions  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are ran domized. Subjects 
will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized.  
The safety population will consist of all subjects who are randomized and received at least one 
dose of IP.  Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually 
receive.  
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects included in the ITT population who 
receive at least one dose of IP, have both baseline and at least one post -treatment modified  
sPGA -G evaluation, and have no important protocol deviations which may affect analyses in the 
Placebo -controlled Phase.  
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations  
With a 
total of approximately 286 subjects and a randomization ratio of 1:1, Study PSOR -025 will 
randomize approximately 143 subjects to APR 30 BID and 143 subjects to placebo. This sample 
size will provide 85 power to detect a minimum treatment difference of 15  at Week 16 (25  
for APR 30 BID and 10  for placebo) for the primary endpoint using a chi -square test at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 after adjusting for a 20  dropout rate. The sample size

9.6. Efficacy Analysis  
9.6.1.  Efficacy Evaluation for the P lacebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16)  
For the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 -16), the analyses for efficacy endpoints will be based 
on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all subjects who are randomized . Statistical 
comparisons will be ma de between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo. All statistical tests will 
be at the 2 -sided 0.05 significance level  and the corresponding p -values and 95  confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the prop ortions of subjects who achieve modified  sPGA -G response at 
Week 16 (defined as modified  sPGA -G score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] with at least a 
2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16). It will be analyzed using the ITT population. A 
sensitivity analysis will be performed using the PP population.   
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the CMH (Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel) test 
adjusting for the stratification factor at randomization. The [ADDRESS_611839], 
the adjusted treatment  difference in proportion using the weighted average of the treatment 
differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated 2 -sided 95 CIs 
using a normal approximation to the weighted average will be provided.  
Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the multiple imputation (MI) method (SAS 
Institute Inc., 2011 ) based on similar subjects who remained in the study as the primary method. 
Details of the MI method will be provided  in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Sensitivity 
analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the non -responder imputation (NRI) 
method. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will only be used for the 
exploratory purpose.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the ITT population. The 2 -sided 
p-values and 2 -sided 95 confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported for treatment difference 
between apremilast and placebo arms. Mult iplicity adjustment will be specified in the next

by [CONTACT_477052] -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs; no inferenti al testing for statistical significance will be 
performed. Data from safety assessments will be summarized descriptively for the Placebo -
controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Exposure Period when subjects receive 
apremilast treatment. For saf ety analyses in the Placebo -controlled Phase, baseline will be 
relative to the first dose date following randomization at Week 0. For safety analyses in 
Apremilast Exposure Period, baseline will be relative to the first apremilast dose date at Week  [ADDRESS_611844] Extension Phase (Weeks 16 -32). 
Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Act ivities 
(MedDRA) classification system. All TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term, severity and relationship to investigational product. TEAEs leading to death or to 
discontinuation from treatment and serious adverse events will be  summarized and listed 
separately.  
Data from other safety assessments will be summarized descriptively. Shift tables for laboratory 
parameters showing the number of subjects with values low, normal, and high comparing with 
the normal reference ranges pre -treatment versus post treatment will be provided.  
To account for the different exposure to the investigational product, adverse events or marked 
laboratory abnormalities will also be summarized using the exposure adjusted incidence rate, in 
addition to the simple incidence rates.

risk of death from the AE);  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24600] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);  
 Is a congenita l anomaly/birth defect;  
 Constitutes an important medical event.  
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered  serious.  
Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15976]: 
 a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.  
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not a ssociated with any 
deterioration in condition.  
 the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportabl e SAE.  
 a procedure for protocol/disease -related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, 
sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of such procedures remains a repo rtable 
SAE.  
 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE.  
 a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be 
documented in the source document and t he CRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72613] a complication remains a reportable SAE.  
 an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre -existing condition, 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline.  
 emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.

relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome.  
10.2.2.  Severity/Intensity  
For all AEs, the investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event.  
Mild  
 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only  
 Intervention not indicated  
 Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected  
 No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required  
Moderate  
 Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort  
 Local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
 More than minimal interferen ce with ADLs but able to carry out daily social and 
functional activities.  
 Drug therapy may be required  
Severe (could be non -serious or serious)  
 Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain  
 Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention  
 Interferenc e with ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional 
activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest)  
 Drug therapy is required  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myoca rdial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pos e a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.

occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:  
Not suspected:  a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficien t 
explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected:  there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and 
the adverse event.  
Causality should be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.  
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a  comparator, ancillary or additional 
non-IP that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_11337] , please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].  
10.2.4.  Duration  
For each AE, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event.  
10.2.5.  Action Taken  
The investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of each AE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose modification, as appropriate) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were giv en for the event.  
10.2.6.  Outcome  
The investigator will report the outcome of the event for each AE.  
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovere d with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ). 
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:  
 results in discontinuation from the study;  
 requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any o ther therapeutic 
intervention; or

process and/or organ toxicity or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition.  
Regardless of severity grade, only laborat ory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded as the AE on the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of a 
diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, re cord thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).  
10.4. Pregnancy  
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in females of childbearing potential are 
immediately reportable events .   
10.4.1.  Females of Childbearing Potential – Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated -subunit of human chorionic 
gonadotropin [ -hCG] or positive pregnancy test in a female subject of childbearing potential 
regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP, or within [ADDRESS_611851] ’s 
last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events.  Investigational product is to be 
discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the IP to the 
investigator. The preg nancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to 
[COMPANY_010] Global Patient  Safety immediately by [CONTACT_477074], or other appropriate method, 
using the Pregnancy Notification Form or approved equivalent form (refer to Appendix  I).  The 
Pregnancy Notification Form must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within [ADDRESS_611852] ’s pregnancy. (Note:  Sites are not required to provide any information on 
the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or  regions local privacy laws).  
After obtaining the female subject ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant health 
information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete 
the pregnancy questionnaire for an y female subject who becomes pregnant while taking IP 
through [ADDRESS_611853] ’s last dose of IP. This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] 
Global Patient Safety. Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted 12 months after the birth of 
the child (if applicable).  
The investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy and must 
notify [COMPANY_010]  Global Patient Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either 
normal or abnormal outcome).  
If the outcome of the pregna ncy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the investigator

10.4.2.  Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant  
In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 28 days after 
discontinuing IP, the information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Noti fication Form (refer to 
Appendix  I). The form must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety with 24 hours of the 
investigator’s/site’s awareness of the pregnancy (Note:  Sites are not required to provide any 
information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local

The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant 
health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain additional pregnancy 
information.    
After obtaining the female partner ’s signed consent for  release of pregnancy and infant health 
information the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant health information on the 
pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_246532]. This information will

12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products  
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject.  If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily  discontinued if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.    
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not  be delayed or refused by [CONTACT_1034].  However, the investigator may 
contact [CONTACT_81695], mainly in the 
interest of the subject.

documentation of this study are designed to ensure that [COMPANY_010] , its authorized representative, and 
investigator abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as de scribed in International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined 
in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC prior to 
commencement. The investigator wi ll conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with 
applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
13.2. Investigator Responsibilities  
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Pract ice and in 
the local regulations.  [COMPANY_010]  staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all 
investigators who in turn will select their staff.  
The investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed  
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study -related duties and functions, 
including obligations of confidentiality of [COMPANY_010]  information. The investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study -related duties.  
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening m ust have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.  
The investigator, or a designated member of the investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records ( eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study -related charts) for source data 
verification.  The investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.  
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with th e exception of the 
information provided by [CONTACT_477081]) is considered [COMPANY_010]  confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by [CONTACT_477082] a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by [CONTACT_432915], or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  [COMPANY_010]  protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the investigator’s or their institution’s website) without express written 
approval from Amg en.  Information proposed for posting on the investigator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to [COMPANY_010]  for review and approval, providing at least [ADDRESS_611863] and/or their caregiver as agreed by [CONTACT_1560].

prior to any study related procedures.  
Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study 
and of the i nformed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents 
including the date.  The original ICF signed and dated by [CONTACT_292057]’s entry into the study,  must be maintained 
in the investigator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study w hen the amended protocol is implemented must be re -
consented with the revised version of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by [CONTACT_477083]’s 
study files and  a copy given to the study subject.  
13.4. Confidentiality  
[COMPANY_010]  affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). [COMPANY_010]  requires 
the investigator to p ermit [COMPANY_010]  's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or auth orization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual.  
13.5. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_477084] R esearch 
Physician/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically re ference the investigator name, 
protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/EC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/EC for 
information purposes.  
13.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their 
dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is 
sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with 
local legal requirements.

members o f the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose 
the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accorda nce with GCP. For 
example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. 
Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdict ion, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a committee member. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must b e met.  
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.  
The investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, 
between a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72616]/EC. This statement also applies to any 
communication between the investigator (or coordinat ing investigator, if applicable) and 
regulatory authorities.

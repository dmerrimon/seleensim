1 BACKGROUND  AND  SIGNIFICANCE:
2 Obesity  is  common  among  persons  with  severe  mental  illness  (SMI),  especially  those  with  bipolar
3 disorder  (BP)  (1-5).  It  is  estimated  that  45-55%  of  people  with  SMI  are  obese,  making  obesity  1.5-2  times
4 more  common  among  those  with  SMI  than  among  the  general  population  (6).  Indeed,  in  a  recent
5 pragmatic  lithium  trial  conducted  in  BP,  69%  of  the  subjects  were  overweight  or  obese  (7).  Although  6
 the  precise  mechanism  underlying  the  relationship  between  obesity  and  SMI  is  unknown,  it  is  thought  to
7 be  multifactorial,  involving  genetic  factors,  intrinsic  features  of  SMI  (e.g.,  overeating,  poor  dietary
8 choices,  sedentary  lifestyle,  and  sleep  dysregulation),  and  the  weight-gaining  effects  of  most  of  the
9 psychotropic  medication  used  to  treat  SMI  (1-4,  6,  8-10)
10
11 Importantly,  obesity  is  thought  to  contribute  to  the  well-documented  elevated  mortality  from
12 cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  among  those  with  BP  (11-15).  Thus,  weight  reduction  in  obese  people  with
13 BP  might  be  important  for  reducing  their  morbidity  and  mortality  from  CVD  and  other  obesity-related
14 conditions  (e.g.,  diabetes  and  metabolic  syndrome).  Conversely,  the  presence  of  obesity  in  patients  with
15 BP  is  associated  with  a  more  severe  course  of  illness  (16,  17),  a  lower  health-related  quality  of  life  (18),  16
 reductions  in  brain  gray  and  white  volumes  (19,  20),  and  non-adherence  with  antipsychotic  medications  17
 (21).  Indeed,  it  has  been  hypothesized  that  successful  treatment  of  obesity  in  those  with  BP  might  benefit
18 mental  as  well  as  physical  health  (17).  It  is  thus  imperative  that  obesity  be  a  focus  of  treatment  in  those  [ADDRESS_810694]  and  such  programs  are  difficult  to  implement  and
23 not  widely  available  (22-25).  Several  medications  have  been  shown  to  mitigate  psychotropic-induced
24 weight  gain,  particularly  metformin  and  topi[INVESTIGATOR_052],  but  many  patients  either  do  not  respond  to  these
25 agents  or  are  unable  to  tolerate  them  (2).  Importantly,  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  newly  available  weight-

28 In  December  2014,  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  approved  liraglutide  [rDNA  origin]  3  mg/day
29 subcutaneous  [sc]  injection)  (Saxenda®)  as  a  treatment  option  for  chronic  weight  management  in
30 individuals  with  obesity  (26-32).  The  drug  is  approved  for  use  in  adults  with  a  body  mass  index  (BMI)  of
31 30  or  greater  (obesity)  or  adults  with  a  BMI  of  27  or  greater  (overweight)  who  have  at  least  one  weight-
32 related  comorbid  condition  such  as  hypertension,  type  2  diabetes,  or  dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]  (33).  Liraglutide  is  a
33 glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  receptor  agonist.  Saxenda®  and  Victoza®  contain  the  same  active
34 ingredient  (liraglutide)  at  different  doses  (3  mg  and  1.8  mg,  respectively).  However,  unlike  Victoza®,
35 Saxenda®  is  not  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes,  as  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  Saxenda®  for
[ADDRESS_810696]  that  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  (Saxenda®),  in  combination  with  a
[ADDRESS_810697],  GLP-1  is  a  gut/brain  peptide  that  is  secreted  from  intestinal  mucosal  enteroendocrine  L  cells  in
43 response  and  in  proportion  to  nutrient  stimulation  of  the  gut,  and  that  suppresses  food  intake  by  [CONTACT_611437]
44 receptors  in  key  areas  of  the  brain  that  regulate  energy  balance  (e.g.,  hypothalamus  and  hindbrain)  (34-
45 37).  In  humans,  administration  of  GLP-1  reduces  food  intake  and  increases  satiation  in  a  dose-dependent
46 manner  (37).  Obesity  in  people  with  BP,  as  well  as  psychotropic-induced  weight  gain,  are  thought  to  be
McElroy July  11,2017 Version  4 2
47 due  to  in  part  to  increased  food  intake  (2).  It  is  thus  possible  that  liraglutide  3.[ADDRESS_810698]  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  may  be
51 effective  for  antipsychotic-induced  weight  gain  and  antipsychotic-induced  obesity  (38).  Thus,  liraglutide
52 has  been  shown  to  produce  weight  loss  in  animal  models  of  olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced  weight  gain  (39,  40).  In
53 one  of  these  studies,  liraglutide  also  produced  antidepressant-like  effects  (40).  (Indeed,  other  animal
[ADDRESS_810699]  antipsychotic  properties  (41).)  In  the  only  published  case  of
55 liraglutide  use  in  a  patient  with  SMI,  an  obese  (BMI  33.5=mg/kg 2 )  60-year-old  woman  with
56 schizophrenia  treated  with  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  liraglutide  (1.8mg/day)  produced  a  sustained  weight  loss  of  7.7  kg  57
 (an  8.7%  body  weight  reduction)  over  two  years  (42).  Liraglutide  was  well  tolerated  and  there  were  no  58
 psychiatric  adverse  events  (i.e.,  the  patient’s  schizophrenia  remained  stable).  At  our  own  center,  we  have
59 treated  a  32-year-old  woman  with  schizoaffective  disorder,  bipolar  type  and  obesity  (BMI=36  mg/kg 2 )
[ADDRESS_810700]  7.5  kg  (an  8.3%  body  weight  reduction)  over  a  4-month  period.  She  reports  the  liraglutide  3.[ADDRESS_810701],  relative  to  other  weight  loss  agents,  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  has  a  favorable  psychiatric  and  68
 cardiovascular  adverse  event  profile  (43,  44).  Regarding  psychiatric  events,  in  the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_611423]  3.0
69 mg  sc  injection  clinical  trials,  6  (0.2%)  of  3384  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection-treated  patients  had  suicidal
70 ideation  (one  of  these  individuals  made  a  suicide  attempt)  compared  with  none  of  the  1941  placebo-
71 treated  patients  (33).  Additionally,  2.4%  of  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_611424]
72 2.0%  had  anxiety,  compared  with  1.7%  and  1.6  %,  respectively,  of  placebo  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Conversely,
73 lorcaserin  (Belviq®)  was  associated  with  euphoria  (0.2%  vs  <  0.1%  for  placebo)  and  is  contraindicated  in
74 patient’s  receiving  serotonergic  medications  (and  many  psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_611425])  (45).  75
 Phenermine/topi[INVESTIGATOR_51945]  (Qsymia®),  at  the  highest  approved  dose,  was  associated  with
76 insomnia  (11.1%  vs  5.8%  for  placebo),  depression/mood  problems  (7.6%  vs  3.4%  for  placebo),  and
77 anxiety  (7.9%  vs  2.6%  for  placebo)  (46).  Additionally,  one  of  the  components  of  Qsymia®,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_052],  is  78
 associated  with  suicidality.  Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]/naltrexone  combination  (Contrave®),  at  the  highest  recommended  79
 dose,  was  associated  insomnia  (9.2%  vs  5.9%  for  placebo),  anxiety  (4.2%  vs  2.8%  for  placebo),  and
80 irritability  (2.6%  vs  1.8%  for  placebo)  (47).  Moreover,  there  are  reports  of  components  of  these  latter
81 medications  (e.g.,  phentermine  and  bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394])  causing  severe  adverse  psychiatric  events,  such  as  mania
82 and  psychosis  (48-52).  Taken  together,  these  findings  suggest  that  liraglutide  3.[ADDRESS_810702]  been  reported  to  produce  enhanced  well-being  in  patients  with

128 RESEARCH  DESIGN  AND  METHODS
129
130 Study  hypothesis  (es):
[ADDRESS_810706]  that  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  will  produce  a  greater
McElroy July  11,2017 Version  4 4
137 percentage  of  patients  who  lose  ≥  5%  of  baseline  body  weight,  and  improve  BMI,  waist  circumference,
138 fasting  lipid  and  glucose  levels,  HgA1 c levels,  and  measures  of  eating  psychopathology.
139
140 Endpoints:
141 The  primary  endpoint  will  be  the  percent  change  in  body  weight  from  Baseline  (Week  0)  to  week
142 40/Early  Termination  (ET)  (see  Table  1  for  a  schedule  of  assessments).  Secondary  endpoints  will  include
143 proportion  of  participants  who  lose  ≥  5%  of  baseline  body  weight,  and  change  from  baseline  in  body
144 weight  (kg),  BMI,  waist  circumference,  and  metabolic  variables  (fasting  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_611426],  and  HgA1 c
145 levels).  Exploratory  secondary  endpoints  will  be  change  from  baseline  in  eating  psychopathology,
146 assessed  with  the  Three  Factor  Eating  Questionnaire  (TFEQ)  (54)  and  Binge  Eating  Scale  (BES)  (55).  147
 Safety  endpoints  assessed  at  each  study  visit  will  be  mental  status  examination,  clinically-administered  148
 scales  that  assess  psychopathology  (CGI-BP  scale  [both  Severity  and  Improvement  subscales],  YMRS,  149
 MADRS,  and  CSSRS),  vital  signs,  and  adverse  events  determined  by  [CONTACT_215131].  Laboratory  tests
150 and  12-lead  electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  will  be  obtained  at  Screening,  week  8,  week  16/ET,  and  week  151
 40/ET.  Compliance  will  be  assessed  at  each  visit  with  inspection  of  returned  multi-dose  pens.  Potential
152 interactions  between  liraglutide  and  psychiatric  medications  will  be  monitored  and  recorded  on  the
153 Potential  Drug  Interaction  form  (see  p.  28).
154
155 Study  type:
156 This  is  a  single-center,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  two-arm,  parallel-group,  fixed-dose
157 efficacy  and  safety  study  with  3  phases:  a  3-27  day  Screening  period;  a  40-week  randomized,  double-
158 blind  Treatment  period  (4  weeks  of  dose  titration  and  36  weeks  of  dose  maintenance);  and  a  1-week  159
 Follow-up  (drug  discontinuation)  period.  The  purpose  of  the  40-week  Blinded  Treatment  phase  is  to
160 establish  the  efficacy  of  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  for  weight  loss  in  obese  patients  with  stable  BP.

179 method(s)  of  contraception  (e.g.,  hormonal  method,  intrauterine  device)  for  at  least  [ADDRESS_810710]  three  months;  those  with  clinically  significant  psychotic  features  or  183
 suicidal  ideation;  those  with  serious  or  unstable  general  medical  illnesses;  those  with  a  personal  or  family
184 history  of  medullary  thyroid  cancer  or  Multiple  Endocrine  Neoplasia  syndrome  type  2;  those  who  are
[ADDRESS_810711]  demonstrated  hypersensitivity  to  liraglutide  3.0  mg  sc  injection  or  any  of  its
186 components;  and  females  who  are  pregnant,  nursing,  or  intend  to  become  pregnant.  Specific  entry  criteria

258 Withdrawal  Criteria:
259 Participants  may  withdraw  at  will  from  the  study  at  any  time.  Participants  will  be  withdrawn  in  the  event
260 of  pregnancy  or  intention  to  become  pregnant.  Additionally,  participants  will  be  discontinued  if  they
261 display:  clinically  significant  suicidality,  defined  as  a  YES  to  item  1  of  the  C-SSRS  or  a  C-SSRS-defined
262 suicide  attempt;  a  YMRS  score  >12  (indicating  at  least  moderately  ill  manic  symptoms);  a  MADRS  score
263 >19  (indicating  at  least  moderately  severe  depressive  symptoms);  a  CGI-I-BP-Severity  score  of  much  or
264 very  much  worsened;  or  clinically  significant  suicidal  ideation  or  psychotic  symptoms  on  mental  status  [ADDRESS_810718]’s
266 discretion  in  response  to  symptoms  of  sufficient  severity  that  a  new  psychiatric  medication  needs  to  be  267
 added  (dosage  changes  in  ongoing  psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_611429]).  The  Investigator  may  also  withdraw
268 participants  for  lack  of  compliance  with  study  procedures  if  she  or  the  research  team  has  any  concerns  for
269 the  participant’s  safety.  Upon  termination  for  any  of  these  reasons,  patients  will  receive  care  judged
270 appropriate  by  [CONTACT_611440],  if  needed,  referral  for  emergency  care.
271
272 Participant  compliance  with  dosing  requirements  will  be  monitored  with  pen  inspection.  Participants
273 displaying  non-compliant  behaviors  with  study  medication  administration  and  accountability  (such  as

274 taking  more  medication  than  prescribed,  losing  pens,  or  failure  to  return  pens  to  clinic)  will  be  re-
[ADDRESS_810719]  Replacement:
278 Subjects  will  not  be  replaced  if  they  withdraw  or  become  ineligible  at  any  time  after  the  Baseline  visit.
279
280 Rational  for  study  population:
281 Approximately  half  of  persons  with  BP  are  obese,  yet  no  medication  is  regularly  used  (or  indicated)  for
282 weight  loss  in  this  population,  signifying  a  large  unmet  medical  need.  Data  showing  that  a  weight  loss
283 drug  is  beneficial  in  obese  persons  with  BP  would  be  a  significant  advancement  to  the  medical  field.  284

288 0  through  Visit  4),  every  other  week  for  12  weeks  (dose  maintenance,  Visits  5  through  10),  and  then  every
289 4  weeks  for  24  weeks  (continued  dose  maintenance,  Visits  11-16)  for  assessments  and  study  medication  [ADDRESS_810721]  dosage  changes  in  their  major  psychotropic  medications  (antipsychotics,  mood  stabilizers,  and
292 antidepressants),  and  such  changes  will  be  recorded  on  the  concomitant  medication  form.  Addition  of
293 these  psychotropic  medications  will  also  be  permitted  and  these  medications  will  be  recorded  on  the
294 concomitant  medication  form.
295
296 All  participants  will  be  offered  nutritional  and  lifestyle  modification  counseling  following  the  2015-2020

300 Study  medication  will  be  supplied  in  pre-filled,  multi-dose  pens  that  can  deliver  the  following  doses
301 subcutaneously:  0.6mg,  1.2mg,  1.8mg,  2.4mg,  and  3mg.  At  the  beginning  of  the  Blinded  Treatment
302 period,  the  dosage  of  liraglutide  will  be  0.6  mg/day.  Study  drug  dosage  will  be  increased  to  1.2mg/day  on
303 day  7  (Visit  1).  In  the  following  3  weeks,  the  dose  will  be  increased  to  1.8mg/day  (day  14,  Visit  2),
304 2.4mg/day  (day  21,  Visit  3),  and  then  to  the  target  dose  of  3mg/day  (day  28,  Visit  4),  respectively.  If
305 patients  do  not  tolerate  an  increased  dose  during  dose  escalation,  the  dose  escalation  can  be  delayed  for
306 approximately  one  additional  week.  The  study  medication  dose  (3  mg/day)  will  remain  unchanged  307
 during  the  final  36  weeks  of  the  Blinded  Treatment  Phase.
308
309 Study  drug  will  be  discontinued  upon  completion  of  the  40-week  Blinded  Treatment  period  (Visit  16)  or
[ADDRESS_810722]  terminates  the  study  earlier  (early  termination,  ET).  The  follow-up  period  begins  upon
311 completion  of  Visit  16  (week  40),  ET  (depending  upon  when  the  subject  completes  their  study
312 participation),  and  concludes  with  a  follow-up  visit  (Visit  17)  which  occurs  [ADDRESS_810723].

321 visit  (Visit  -1),  informed  consent  will  be  obtained.  Sections  A,  B,  and  C  of  the  Structured  Clinical
322 Interview  for  DSM-IV  (SCID)  (61)  will  be  performed  to  establish  that  the  patient  meets  DSM-IV  criteria
323 for  BP.  A  mental  status  examination,  YMRS,  MADRS,  and  CGI-BP-Severity  Scale  will  be  performed  to
324 establish  the  severity  of  psychiatric  symptoms.  Medical  history  will  be  reviewed,  a  physical  exam
325 performed,  and  laboratory  studies  (complete  metabolic  profile  with  fasting  glucose  and  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],  CBC  with
326 diff  and  platelets,  liver  function  tests,  renal  function  tests,  electrolytes,  HgA 1c level,  and  urinalysis)  and  327
 ECG  will  be  obtained.  Patients’  mental  health  providers  will  be  consulted  about  their  suitability  for  study
328 participation.  Based  on  these  evaluations,  it  will  be  determined  whether  participants  meet  entry  criteria;  329
 participants  meeting  these  criteria  will  continue  in  the  screening  process.  The  patient  will  not  receive  any
330 disallowed  medications  during  this  period.
331
332 Patient  screening  requires:
333 1.  Informed  consent

383 maintenance;  Visits  11  through  16)  for  assessments  and  dispensation  of  study  medication.  At  each  visit
384 from  Baseline  (Visit  0)  through  Visit  16,  the  participant  will  be  evaluated  for  weight,  vital  signs,  mental
385 status  examination,  psychiatric  symptoms,  concomitant  medications,  adverse  events,  and  potential  drug
386 interactions.
387
388 During  the  Treatment  period,  items  2-7,  8  and  11-14  from  the  Baseline  evaluation  will  be  repeated  at  each  389
 scheduled  visit  and  at  ET  visits  (see  Table  1).  In  addition,  items  9  and  10  will  be  repeated  at  Visits  4,  6,  8,  390
 and  10-16/ET.  Laboratory  tests,  ECG,  and  urinalysis  will  be  repeated  at  Visits  6,  10,  and  16.  Urine
391 pregnancy  tests  will  be  performed  at  every  visit  (Visits  0-16/ET).  Used  and  unused  study  medication  and
392 packaging  will  be  collected  and  drug  accountability  assessed  at  every  visit.  Every  effort  will  be  made  to
393 keep  the  participant  on  the  original  time-frame  for  scheduled  visits.  If  the  participant  deviates  from  this
394 schedule,  every  effort  will  be  made  to  return  him/her  to  the  original  schedule  of  visits.
395
396 Participants  will  be  instructed  to  bring  their  used  and  unused  study  medication  and  packaging  to  every
397 visit.  Participant  compliance  and  drug  accountability  will  be  assessed  by  [CONTACT_611441]

443 abnormalities  in  the  review  of  systems  and  exam  will  be  noted  in  the  source  documents.
444
445 The  following  assessments  will  be  used  to  assess  safety  at  each  visit:  vital  signs,  taken  after  the
[ADDRESS_810737],  concomitant  medication  form,  adverse
448 events,  drug  interaction  form,  and  study  drug  accountability.  All  adverse  events  will  be  evaluated  as
449 potential  drug  interactions  for  those  medications  used  to  treat  BP  (mood  stabilizers,  antipsychotics,
450 antidepressants,  anxiolytics,  and  sedative-hypnotics)  with  the  drug  interaction  form.  A  drug  interaction  is

454 The  YMRS  (56)  is  a  widely  used,  validated,  and  reliable  clinician-administrated  instrument  that  assesses
455 the  severity  of  the  symptoms  of  mania.  It  consists  of  11  items  rated  on  a  scale  of  0  to  4  (items  1-4,  7,  10,
456 and  11)  or  0  to  8  (items  5,  6,  8,  and  9)  (total  score  range  0  to  60),  with  0  being  the  absence  of  symptoms
457 and  higher  scores  representing  greater  severity  of  manic  symptoms.  The  total  thus  ranges  from  0  (no
458 symptoms)  to  60  (extremely  severe  symptoms).  A  mild  level  of  symptoms  corresponds  to  a  score  of  ≤  12.
459
460 The  MADRS  (57)  is  a  widely  used,  validated,  and  reliable  clinician-administered  measure  of  depressive
461 symptoms.  It  consists  of  10  items,  with  each  item  yielding  a  score  of  0  to  6  (total  score  range  0  to  60).  462
 Higher  scores  indicate  more  severe  depressive  symptoms.  Usual  cutoff  points  are:  normal  is  0  to  6;  mild
463 depression  is  7  to  19,  moderate  depression  is  20  to  34;  and  >34  is  severe  depression.
464
465 The  Clinical  Global  Severity  item  of  the  CGI-BP  (CGI-BP-S)  consists  of  seven  ordered  categories  that
466 describe  the  global  severity  of  the  patient’s  BP  (58).  The  categories  (and  the  integer  values  assigned  to
467 them)  for  the  purpose  of  analyses  are:  normal,  not  at  all  ill  (1),  borderline  mentally  ill  (2),  mildly  ill  (3),
468 moderately  ill  (4),  markedly  ill  (5),  severely  ill  (6),  and  among  the  most  extremely  ill  (7).  The  Clinical
469 Global  Improvement  item  of  the  CGI-BP  (CGI-BP-I)consists  of  seven,  ordered  categories  that  describe
470 the  patient’s  global  condition  compared  with  baseline  (58).  The  categories  (and  the  integer  values
471 assigned  to  them  for  the  purpose  of  analyses)  are  as  follows:  very  much  improved  (1),  much  improved
472 (2),  minimally  improved  (3),  no  change  (4),  minimally  worse  (5),  much  worse  (6),  and  very  much  worse
473 (7).
474
475 The  C-SSRS  is  a  summary  measure  of  suicidality,  assessing  both  suicidal  behavior  and  ideation,  and  has
476 been  used  at  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  and  in  multi-site  industry  trials  nationally  and
477 internationally  in  a  range  of  therapeutic  areas  and  indications  (59).

494 Other  Assessments:
495 The  TFEQ  is  a  reliable  and  validated  self-report  measure  of  three  domains  of  eating  behavior  often  496
 deranged  in  people  with  obesity:  hunger,  disinhibition  over  eating,  and  cognitive  restraint  over  eating
497 (54).  The  BES  is  a  valid  and  reliable  self-report  scale  that  assesses  the  presence  and  severity  of  binge
498 eating  symptoms  (55).

508 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS:
[ADDRESS_810743]  on  the  mean  weight  change  from  baseline  to
511 week  40  (or  endpoint  for  patients  who  discontinue  prematurely)  in  the  two  treatment  groups  in  the
512 modified  intent-to-treatment  (ITT)  sample.  This  sample  will  consist  of  all  study  participants  who:  1)  were
513 randomized,  2)  received  at  least  one  study  medication  dosage,  and  3)  had  at  least  one  post-baseline
[ADDRESS_810744]  a  5%  attrition  rate  from  baseline  to  week  1.  We  therefore  expect  the
[ADDRESS_810745]  size  corresponds  to  a  4.5  kg  greater  weight  reduction  in  the  liraglutide  group  vs.  the  placebo
519 group.  The  4.5  kg  reduction  was  calculated  (0.76  x  6.0)  using  an  expected  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  6.0
520 kg  based  on  Wadden  et  al.  (SD=7.0  at  56  weeks)  and  Astrup  et  al.  (SD=5.6  for  power  analysis).  This  is  a
[ADDRESS_810746]  our  primary  analysis  (longitudinal
523 mixed  model)  to  have  more  power  due  to  the  repeated  visit  data  for  each  subject  (60  subjects  x  16  524
 treatment  period  visits  =  960  maximum  number  of  observations).
525
526 Statistical  Methods
527 Chi-square,  Fisher’s  Exact,  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  or  two-sample  t-tests  will  be  used  to  examine  statistical
528 differences  between  the  placebo  and  drug  condition  on  baseline  characteristics  and  categorical  outcome
529 measures.  The  primary  analyses  will  be  longitudinal  data  analyses  (LDA)  using  PROC  MIXED  (SAS,
530 Cary  N.C.  U.S.A.).  LDA  will  model  the  mean  change  in  the  primary  and  secondary  outcome  measures,
[ADDRESS_810747]  if  the  slopes  of  the  regression  lines  for  the  liraglutide  and  placebo  groups  are  536
 different.  A  group  difference  (Drug  [week  40-week  0]  –  Placebo  [week  40-week  0])  will  be  reported  [ADDRESS_810748]-baseline  data  will  be  used  in  the  LDA  model  and  the  difference  between  treatments  at  week  40
539 will  be  reported.  These  mixed  models  will  allow  for  random  coefficients  (intercept  and  time  variable),  as
[ADDRESS_810749]  model  will  be  chosen  using  the  Akaike  Information  Criterion-corrected
542 (AICc).  The  distribution  of  the  outcome  measures  will  be  checked  for  normality,  and  transformations  will
[ADDRESS_810750]  (LOCF),  baseline  to  endpoint  change  scores  will  be  computed  for  each  548
 measure  and  two-sample  t-tests  or  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  tests  will  be  used  to  compare  these  changes  549
 between  the  treatment  groups.
550
551 Randomization  will  be  conducted  by  [CONTACT_611444],  the  program  manager  for  the  Lindner  Center  of  HOPE
552 Research  Institute  using  the  program:  http://www.randomization.com .  Block  randomization  (with  block
553 size  of  six  subjects)  will  be  used  to  insure  relatively  equal  patients  in  both  the  drug  and  placebo  groups.
554 Antipsychotic  medications  used  to  treat  BP  are  associated  with  weight  gain  and  development  of  obesity
555 (much  more  so  than  mood  stabilizers).  Randomization  of  subjects  will  therefore  include  current
556 antipsychotic  use  (receiving  at  least  one  of  the  following:  asenapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253],  cariprazine,
557 chlorpromazine,  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  haloperidol,  loxapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  paliperidone,  perphenazine,  quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],

579 ETHICS:
580 The  University  of  Cincinnati  (UC)  IRB  must  approve  all  protocols,  informed  consent  forms,  and  study  [ADDRESS_810754]  be  obtained  from  584
 every  participant  who  takes  part  in  a  study  prior  to  performing  any  study-related  activities,  including
585 screening  laboratories,  vital  signs,  or  questionnaires.  When  a  potential  protocol  candidate  is  identified,  the
586 investigator  or  research  coordinator  will  discuss  the  study  in  detail  with  the  potential  participant.  An
587 explanation  of  the  study,  its  risks  and  benefits,  and  what  would  be  required  of  the  participant  is  discussed.
588 The  participant  will  be  given  a  copy  of  the  informed  consent  document  to  read  in  a  quiet  environment
589 without  distraction.  The  participant  will  be  encouraged  to  take  the  consent  form  home  so  he  or  she  may
590 discuss  it  with  family  members.  All  questions  and  concerns  are  addressed  throughout  this  process  by  [CONTACT_941]

638 No  trial  medication  will  be  dispensed  to  any  person  not  enrolled  in  the  study.  All  unused  medication(s)  639
 will  be  stored  separately  from  used  trial  medication(s).  Drug  accountability  for  all  trial  product(s)  on  the
640 participant  and  trial  site  level  will  be  performed  by  [CONTACT_611448].  For
641 participants,  accountability  will  be  performed  at  every  visit;  on  site  level  the  accountability  will  be
642 performed  every  3  months.  Return  of  used/unused  trial  product(s)  and  destruction  of  returned  trial  product
[ADDRESS_810759]  will  be  generated  by  [CONTACT_18854].  Genie
651 Groff,  the  program  manager  for  the  Lindner  Center  of  HOPE  Research  Institute,  using
652 http://www.randomization.com .  Block  randomization  method  will  be  used  (in  blocks  of  six  subjects)  to  653
 ensure  a  balanced  number  of  subjects  get  active  drug  and  placebo,  and  to  prevent  long  sequences  of  one
654 treatment  assignment.  Treatment  allocation  will  be  known  by  [CONTACT_611449]
655 ([CONTACT_611458],  who  generated  the  randomization  list)  and  kept  at  a  secure  location  (a  locked  cabinet  in
656 the  LCOH  Research  Institute).
657 Breaking  of  Blinded  Codes
658 The  code  for  a  particular  participant  may  be  broken  in  a  medical  emergency  if  knowing  the  identity  of  the
659 treatment  allocation  would  influence  the  treatment  of  the  participant  or  if  demanded  by  [CONTACT_47991].  660
661 Whenever  a  code  is  broken,  the  person  breaking  the  code  ([CONTACT_611458])  will  record  the  time,  date  and
662 reason  as  well  as  his/her  initials  in  the  source  documents.  If  a  blind  must  be  broken  on  an  emergent  basis,
663 [CONTACT_611459]  will  be  contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Her  work  number  is  [PHONE_12652].  Of  note,  [CONTACT_611460]  is  available
664 24hours/day,  7  days  a  week  by  [CONTACT_611450]  ([PHONE_12653]).
665
666 The  Sponsor  will  be  notified  immediately  if  the  code  needs  to  be  broken.
667
668 All  codes  (whether  broken  or  not)  must  be  kept  throughout  the  trial  period.  Accountability  of  all  broken
669 or  unbroken  codes  (hard  copy  and  electronic)  will  be  performed  at  or  after  trial  closure.

712 Adverse  Event  Reporting  and  Definitions:
713
714 Definitions
715
716 Adverse  Event  (AE):
[ADDRESS_810761](s).  This  includes  events  reported  from  the  first  trial  related  activity  after  the  participant
[ADDRESS_810762]  treatment  follow-up  period  as  defined  in  the  protocol.  The
720 following  should  not  be  recorded  as  AEs,  but  recorded  as  medical  history/concomitant  illness  on  the  CRF
721 at  screening:
722       Pre-planned  procedure,  unless  the  condition  for  which  the  procedure  was  planned  has  worsened
[ADDRESS_810763]  trial  related  activity  after  the  participant  has  signed  the  informed  consent
724       Pre-existing  conditions  found  as  a  result  of  screening  procedures
725
726 Clinical  Laboratory  Adverse  Event:
727 A  clinical  laboratory  AE  is  any  clinical  laboratory  abnormality  regarded  as  clinically  significant  –  i.e.  an
728 abnormality  that  suggests  a  disease  and/or  organ  toxicity  and  is  of  a  degree  of  severity  that  requires  active
McElroy July  11,2017 Version  4 17
729 management,  (i.e.  change  of  dose,  discontinuation  of  trial  product,  more  frequent  follow-up  or  diagnostic
730 investigation).
731
732 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE):
733 A  serious  AE  is  an  experience  at  any  dose  that  results  in  any  of  the  following:
734                     Death
735       A  life-threatening*  experience
736       In-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611431]
737       A  persistent  or  significant  disability/incapacity
738       A  congenital  anomaly/birth  defect
739       Important  medical  events  that  may  not  result  in  death,  be  life-threatening*,  or  require
740 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611432],  based  upon  appropriate  medical  judgement,  they
741 may  jeopardise  the  participant  and  may  require  medical  or  surgical  intervention  to  prevent  one  of
742 the  outcomes  listed  in  this  definition
743       Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_611433]
744
745 *The  term  life-threatening  in  the  definition  of  SAE  refers  to  an  event  in  which  the  participant  was  at  risk
[ADDRESS_810764]  always  be  reported  as  an  SAE  using  the  important  medical  event  750
 criterion  if  no  other  seriousness  criteria  are  applicable:  1)  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_611433]
[ADDRESS_810765];  and  2)  risk  of  liver  injury  defined  as  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  or  aspartate
752 aminotransferase  (AST)  >3  times  the  upper  limit  of  normal.
753
754 Serious  Adverse  Drug  Reaction  (SADR):
755 An  adverse  drug  reaction  (ADR)  is  an  adverse  event  for  which  a  causal  relationship  (Possible/Probable
756 relation)  between  the  study  drug  and  the  occurrence  of  the  event  is  suspected.  The  ADR  should  be
757 classified  as  serious  if  it  meets  one  or  more  of  the  seriousness  criteria.
758 Medication  Errors:
759 A  medication  error  concerning  trial  products  is  defined  as:  administration  of  wrong  drug  or  use  of  wrong
760 device;  wrong  route  of  administration,  such  as  intramuscular  instead  of  subcutaneous;  administration  of
[ADDRESS_810766];  or  accidental
[ADDRESS_810767]  were  likely  to  happen
764 as  judged  by  [CONTACT_11168],  although  they  did  not  necessarily  occur.
765
766 Non-Serious  Adverse  Event:
767 A  non-serious  AE  is  any  AE  which  does  not  fulfil  the  definition  of  an  SAE.
768
769 Severity  Assessment  Definitions:
770       Mild:  Transient  symptoms,  no  interference  with  the  participant’s  daily  activities
771       Moderate:  Marked  symptoms,  moderate  interference  with  the  participant’s  daily  activities
772       Severe:  Considerable  interference  with  the  participant’s  daily  activities,  unacceptable
773
774 Relationship  to  study  medication  Assessment  Definitions:
McElroy July  11,2017 Version  4 18
775       Probable:  Good  reasons  and  sufficient  documentation  to  assume  a  causal  relationship
776       Possible:  A  causal  relationship  is  conceivable  and  cannot  be  dismissed
777       Unlikely:  The  event  is  most  likely  related  to  an  etiology  other  than  the  trial  product
778
779 Outcome  Categories  and  Definitions:
780       Recovered:  Fully  recovered  or  by  [CONTACT_611451]
[ADDRESS_810768]  trial  related  activity  after  the  participant  signed  the  informed  consent  782
       Recovering:  The  condition  is  improving  and  the  participant  is  expected  to  recover  from  the  event.
783                      This  term  should  only  be  used  when  the  participant  has  completed  the  trial
784       Recovered  with  sequelae:  As  a  result  of  the  AE,  the  participant  suffered  persistent  and  significant
785                      disability/incapacity  (e.g.  became  blind,  deaf,  paralysed).  Any  AE  recovered  with  sequelae  should
786                      be  rated  as  an  SAE.
787       Not  recovered
788       Fatal:  This  term  is  only  applicable  if  the  subject  died  from  a  condition  related  to  the  reported  AE.
[ADDRESS_810769]  before  he/she  died  should  be  assessed  as
790 “recovered/resolved”,  “recovering/resolving”,  “recovered/resolved  with  sequelae”  or  “not
791 recovered/not  resolved.”  An  AE  with  fatal  outcome  must  be  reported  as  an  SAE.
792       Unknown
[ADDRESS_810770]  the  following  information  at  minimum  for  each  SAE  and  provide  it  to  the  University
797 of  Cincinnati  IRB  and  Novo  Nordisk  within  72  hours:
798 1.  Study  name
799 2.  Patient  identification  (e.g.  initials,  sex,  age)
800 3.  Event  (preferably  a  diagnosis)
801 4.  Drug
802 5.  Reporter  identification  (e.g.  Name,  or  initials)
803 6)  Causality
804 7)  Outcome
[ADDRESS_810771]-
809 treatment  follow-up  period  as  stated  in  the  protocol.  The  site  intends  to  comply  with  all  local  legal,
810 regulatory,  and  IRB  requirements  related  to  AE  reporting.  The  site  and  the  principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_611434]
811 responsible  for  reporting  of  adverse  events  including  SAEs,  suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse
812 reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs),  and  SADRs,  to  the  competent  authority  and  University  of  Cincinnati  Institutional
[ADDRESS_810772].”  Follow-up  of  Adverse  Events
818 During  and  following  a  participant’s  participation  in  a  clinical  trial,  the  investigator  will  carefully  assess
819 and  provide  adequate  medical  care  to  the  study  participant  for  any  study-related  adverse  events,  including
820 clinically  significant  laboratory  values  related  to  the  study.  The  Lindner  Center  of  HOPE  will  decide  on  a
McElroy July  11,2017 Version  4 19
821 case  by  [CONTACT_611452].  This
822 will  be  determined  by  [CONTACT_611453]  a  part  of  the  study  team.  Medical
823 expenses  that  are  deemed  clearly  related  to  study  participation  will  be  reimbursed.  (This  language  will  be
824 included  in  the  consent  form.)
825
826 All  adverse  events  classified  as  serious  or  severe  or  possibly/probably  related  to  the  trial  product  will  be
[ADDRESS_810773]  been  resolved.  For  cases  of  chronic
828 conditions,  follow-up  until  the  outcome  category  is  “recovered”  is  not  required,  as  these  cases  can  be
829 closed  with  an  outcome  of  “recovering”  or  “not  recovered.”
830
831 All  other  adverse  events  will  be  followed  until  the  outcome  of  the  event  is  “recovering”  (for  chronic
832 conditions),  or  “recovered”  or  until  the  end  of  the  post-treatment  follow-up  stated  in  the  protocol,  [ADDRESS_810774]  report  to  Novo  Nordisk  about  the  pregnancy,
839 pregnancy  outcome,  and  health  of  the  newborn  infant(s),  as  well  as  AEs  in  connection  with  the
840 pregnancy,  and  AEs  in  the  foetus  and  newborn  infant.  Reporting  of  pregnancy  by  [CONTACT_611454]
841 occur  within  the  same  timelines  described  above  for  reporting  of  Adverse  Events.  Pregnancy
842 complications  will  be  recorded  as  adverse  event(s).  If  the  infant  has  a  congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  this
843 will  be  reported  and  followed  up  as  a  serious  adverse  event.
844
845 Precautions/Over-dosage
846 Effects  of  overdose  when  treated  with  liraglutide  might  include  severe  nausea  and  severe  vomiting.  In  the
847 event  of  overdosage,  appropriate  supportive  treatment  will  be  initiated  according  to  the  participant’s
848 clinical  signs  and  symptoms.  All  participants  in  the  trail  will  be  appropriately  educated  on  how  to  use  the
849 pen  in  order  to  avoid  overdosing  and  how  to  proceed  in  event  of  accidental  overdosing

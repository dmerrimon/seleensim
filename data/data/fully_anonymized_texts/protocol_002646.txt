NUMBER OF SITES  Approximately 26  
RATIONALE  There are currently no large, multicenter prospective clinical trials 
examining management of constipation or other gastrointestinal ( GI) 
symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis ( CF). Current 
recommendations in the CF literature are largely based on expert consensus and opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153]. Yet, constipation and other GI symptoms are crucial factors in quality of life ( QOL ) and maintenance of optimal 
nutritional state in people with CF. This stu dy will use GI -
symptomatology questionnaires to understand the multiple overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_223660]. This would be followed by [CONTACT_223672] -
based algorithms, starting with constipation.  In the future, we would also like to evaluate the impact of CF modulators on common GI symptoms and evaluate how this might impact the development of symptom -specific algorithms . 
STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study  designed to 
collect gastrointestinal related  data in patients with CF.  
Eligible subjects  will be consented and enrolled in the study at the 
Enrollment Visit. At the visit, the subject or parent/guardian will 
complete the patient reported outcome surveys (PROs)  using the ir 
mobile device (e.g., smartphone or tablet) . The PROs will consist of  
four questionnaires:  Patient Assessment of Constipation -Symptoms 
(PAC -SYM), Patient Assessment of Gastroi ntestinal- Symptoms 
(PAGI -SYM), Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life 
(PAC -QOL)  and the disease -specific questionnaire .  The disease-
specific questionnaire will include the Bristol Stool Scale  and will 
collect information on  presence of fecal incontinence, stool quality  
and stool frequency .  At the Enrollment V isit, weigh t and height will 
be collected  in addition  to medical history and concomitant 
medication information. The subject  or parent/guardian will complete 
the PROs outside -the-clinic setting  per the S chedule of E vents  using 
their mobile device .

addition to the interim review , the TDNCC will continuous ly monitor 
enrollment and provide  the Advisory Committee quarterly reports of 
enrollment demographics. 
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  The analysis population consists of all eligible subjects who enroll 
into the study. Results will be based primarily on descriptive statistics 
of questionnaire results.  The primary endpoint is the  percentage of 
scheduled outside -the-clinic  assessments with at least one PRO fully 
completed  out of the four questionnaires administered (the PAC -
SYM, PAGI -SYM, PAC -QOL and the disease -specific 
questionnaire). T he denominator for the percentage is the exp ected 
number of outside -the-clinic  assessments (# of enrolled subject s x 3 
outside -the-clinic  assessments/ subject ).  Missing PRO data will be 
extensively summarized including a comparison of the representativeness of the enrolled subjects against the larger CF community.  
Constipation is  defined as <[ADDRESS_269163] week 
and/or Bristol Stool type 1 or 2. The secondary endpoint upon which 
the sample size is based is the number (%) of enrolled subjects with 
any occurrence of constipation during 1 month of follow -up. For all 
percentages, the 95% Confidence Interval (95% C.I.) will be calculated using the Wilson method. Summary statistics of stool frequency and type will be tabulated over time to evaluate overall disease fluctuation.  
  
Individual it em responses will be summarized by [CONTACT_223678] s or receiving treatment. Questionnaire 
scores, overall as well as by [CONTACT_223679], will be based on mean scores (and 95% C.I.s) with any group comparison made via the t -test. For 
subjects either receiving treatment or with constipation , mean 
absolute change in scores from the enrollment visit will be reported including the standard deviation and 95% C.I of the change.  For select endpoints, stratification by [CONTACT_223680] ( CFF grant to a gastroenterologist to focus 
on the comprehensive GI care of patients with CF) will be considered. Additional stratification variables include: age, CF genotype, and pancreatic status.  
To evaluate change in PRO scores, a covariate adjusted repeated 
measures model of PRO scores will be fit  in addition to s elect 
graphical figures showing  PRO scores at scheduled assess ments.  No 
adjustment for multiplicity testing will be made. The details of all 
planned analyses will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  Sample size estimates for this study are based on two criteria:  
1. To assess feasibility and ensure representativeness of the 
Protocol GALAXY- OB-18 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: 19 NOV 2018  Page 11 of 32 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 08 JAN 2018  enrolled CF subjects   
2. To estimate prevalence of  GI symptoms (specifically 
constipation)  
The sample size estimate  for this  study is based on a period 
prevalence of constipation (the proportion of subjects with occurrence 
of symptom over a 1 month interval of time) in the 20% -  30% range 
(25% average).  Approximately 400 subjects  will be needed to 
estimate a 25% prevalence of constipation with a 95% C.I. half -width 
of 4.5% (95% C.I. = 20.5%, 29.5%) and assuming a 12% missing data rate. With 400 subjects , this study will allow estimation of 
variability (between and within subject) in 160 pediatric subjects  and 
240 adult subjects (alternatively 40 pediatric and 60 adults for 100 subjects ).

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 08 JAN 2018  1 BACKGROUND  
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by [CONTACT_223681] (CFTR) gene. CFTR encodes a chloride channel that regulates fluidity within the ducts of the body including the lung, stomach, intestine, liver, pancreas, sweat glands, and reproductive organs.  In the lung, mutations in CFTR result in thick secretions  that impair 
movement of cilia and clearance of infection.  In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, mutations similarly affect fluidity of secretions, as well as pH. Recent studies have shown that CFTR is also located in the neurons that innervate the GI tract (1).  Together these mechanisms contribute 
to suboptimal fluidity, inflammation and dysmotility  resulting in a number of gastrointestinal 
manifestations of CF .   
GI symptoms are highly prevalent in people with CF, a dding to the burden of a complex 
multisystem disease. Tabori et al. showed a frequency of abdominal complaints ranging from 20-80% in persons with CF (2).  Questionnaires directed at abdominal complaints have been used in 
pediatric and adult C F clinics and demonstrate a high frequency of abdominal complaints, many 
of them severe (Bozic and Freedman, unpublished data ) (3, 4) . Concerns expressed by [CONTACT_223682], pancreatic insuff iciency, poor appetite, abdominal pain, 
constipation, nausea/bloating and reflux.  These symptoms frequently overlap, with many individual patients experiencing more than one , and they  greatly impact the day -to-day quality of 
life (QOL) of persons with CF.    
In addition, t he impact of CFTR modulators on GI symptoms is not yet well understood.  This is 
due to the variance in location and functional consequence of CFTR within the GI tract, including the pancreas, cholangiocytes, and intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  
The aim of the current project is to describe the burden of GI symptoms and their relationship to 
morbidity in people with CF utilizing existing patient- reported outcome (PRO) measures.  Based 
on these results, we will focus on a series of studies to improve  GI outcomes through 
establishing evidence- based algorithms. In the future, we would also like to evaluate the impact 
of CF modulators on common GI symptoms and evaluate how this might impact the 
development of symptom -specific algorithms.   
1.[ADDRESS_269164] demo nstrates physiological sequelae 
of impaired CFTR function similar to that seen in the lungs. This includes, but is not limited to, 
altered fluid pH (1, 3) , thickened mucus secretions (2, 4) , increased inflammation (5), impaired 
motility (5, 6)  and dysbiosis (7, 8) . 
CFTR is present throughout the GI tract from the esophagus to the rectum (9).  As the biologic 
and physiological processes  of the intestine and its associated GI organs change, so do the 
manifestations of impaired CFTR activity.  However, CF animal models have demonstrated that 
these manifestations do not exist in isolation, with CF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_223662], the lung.  As an example, successful treatment of dysbiosis and/or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in mouse mod els results not only in 
quantitative and qualitative changes in bacterial flora, but also decreased mucus accumulation, decreased inflammation and improved intestinal transit times (10).

quality of life as well as the maintenance of an optimal nutritional s tate in people with CF (1, 3) . 
The majority of studies of GI comorbidit ies seen in CF have been investigated in small single 
center studies, often retrospective. For example, although constipation is common in people with CF, and a source of significant abdominal pain, available studies have focused on the less common distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) .  Studies focused on the lifetime 
prevalence of constipation are scarce, but some report that constipation is common in pediatrics with a prevalence ranging between 26 -47% and 42% in adults (2, 4) . The main obstacle in 
formulating formal treatment recommendations for the GI symptoms in CF has been the overlap of many GI symptoms simultaneously in the same patient with CF and the lack of a focused symptom -based questionnaire that correctly identifies constipation and other GI disorders 
specifically in patients with CF (1, 3- 5). The pathophysiology of many of these GI symptoms in 
CF is unique and perhaps different than what is seen in the gene ral population with multifactorial 
causes which include both an increased viscosity of intestinal mucus with subsequent prolonged transit times in the stomach (gastroparesis), small intestin al bacterial overgrowth  (SIBO), or 
colon (colonic dysmotility or f ecal incontinence due to severe constipation) (5, 6) . In this study, 
we will focus on more common GI conditions that impact the lives of a large number of people 
with CF.  
Recently a systematic review of abdominal co mplaints in adult and pediatric people with CF was 
undertaken, called the JenAbdomen- CF Score 1.0 , which is a comprehensive 17 item survey (7). 
This survey is based on the patient -reported outcomes measures (PROMIS) set forth by [CONTACT_86959] (FDA) in 2009 to better identify GI symptoms in the general population in order to guide future treatments (8). The JenAbdomen study included a total of [ADDRESS_269166] common GI symptoms to be loss of appetite 
(99%), dysgeusia (91%), followed by [CONTACT_223683] (80%), flatulence (78%), and distension (63%). Constipation was noted by 32% of adults and 30% of children and juveniles combine d 
using a frequently used stool consistency scale called the Bristol S tool S cale(9). Unfortunately, 
other important measures of constipation such as quantification of the frequency of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM), complete bowel movements (CSBM), or others in regards to an obstructive defecation seen often in CF such as fecal incontinence or rectal prolapse were not included(10) . Moreover, the JenAbdomen questionnaire and PROMIS do not identify the 
severity of GI symptoms which may be important endpoints in CF.  
Other specific questionnaires focused on GI symptoms in people with CF have been developed 
and studied by [CONTACT_223684]. These include the GI Symptom Tracker (Abbot 
Pharmaceuticals) which is focused predominantly on symptoms associated with pancreatic

used as a screening questionnaire for pulmonologists and other providers involved in the care of 
a CF individual to determine the need for referral of patients to gastroenterologists (Bozic, Freedman, Schwarzenberg,  personal communi cation). These questionnaires are not suitable for 
determining prevalence of GI symptoms in CF, nor for capturing the detail necessary to develop treatment algorithms.  
Several validated questionnaires exist for capturing the overlap of GI symptoms in the g eneral 
population and for categorizing them into specific groups based on most likely GI diagnoses. The validated questionnaires most cited and often used by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) and accepted by [CONTACT_223685] (11), Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (PAGI -SYM) (12), Patient -
Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC -SYM) (13) and Patient - Assessment of 
Constipation Q uality of Life (PAC -QOL) (14).  
ROME IV is used as a diagnostic tool for what was previously termed “Functional Bowel Diseases”;  however , it does not stratify patients based on symptom intensity and was purely 
formed for diagnostic purpose s. It is a long and laborious set of questionnaires and although also 
validated in children more than [ADDRESS_269167], the PAC -SYM is a 12 -item questionnaire that evaluates many  
different GI symptoms including nausea, vomiting, upper or lower abdominal pain, constipation and other questions related to stool habits (13). A higher score corresponds with worse 
symptoms; with a range from 1 to 4 points. In the general adult population, a decrease in score of 
about 1 point indicates moderate improvement and a decrease of about 0.5 points indicating minimal improvement. Another validated scale system is the Bristol Stool Scale discussed above (9, 15)  which is primarily based on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_223663]. A lower score on the Bristol Stool Scale 
(Type 1  and 2) corresponds with harder stool, whereas a higher score suggests diarrhea  (Type 6, 
7) with total range of scores ranging from 1 to 7.   
The PAGI -SYM is a 20 -item questionnaire with six subscales: heartburn/regurgitation, 
fullness/early satiety, nausea/vomiting, bloating, upper abdominal pain, and lower abdominal 
pain and has good internal consistency and reliability (α=0.79 -0.91) (12). This questionnaire 
correlates well with the PAGI -QOL scores (p value < 0.0001) and was developed in fact in 
conjunction with a disease -specific QOL instrument , the PAGI -QOL , making it a robust 
internationally utilized instrument. The PAGI -SYM is a helpful questionnaire for assessing 
symptom severity with good construct validity in subjects with reflux, dyspepsia, abdominal pain 
and gastroparesis  - all symptoms and disorders which people with CF could have. The initial 
purpose of this questionnaire was its application in clinical trials and for assessment of effectiveness of new med ical treatments.  
In addition to the PAGI -QOL, other important quality of life measures also exist for constipation 
and would be important to capture in the CF population. The PAC -QOL has 28 questions also 
rated on a 5 point Likert scale from 0 to 4 which range from not at all (0) to all of the time (4)  
(14). These questions are focused more on the intensity of bloating and constipation, as well as 
covering 4 subscales including worri es and concerns (11 items), physical discomfort (4 items), 
Psychosocial discomfort (8 items) and satisfaction of treatment (5 items).

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: [ADDRESS_269168] commonly accepted definition of constipation has been based on ROME IV criteria defining constipation as less than 3 bowel movements a week. The FDA uses this definition in combination with endpoints such as the number of CSBM  and Bristol Stool Scale Type 1 and 2 
as defining constipation(16) . The FDA ’s PROMIS also defined chronic constipation as decreased 
stool frequency as measured by [CONTACT_223686] a week to assess treatment response and for the purposes of clinical trials (8). Abdominal pain and discomfort were excluded in the 
definition of constipation although these are common in our patients with CF (16). The European 
Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (
ESPGHAN ) has proposed a 
definition of constipation in CF which considers: 1) abdominal pain and/or distention, 2) reduced frequency or increased consistency of stool in the last few weeks or months, and 3) Symptoms 1 and 2 are relieved by [CONTACT_223687] (17). However, this definition was primarily proposed to 
differentiate constipation from DIOS . It remains to be seen whether any of these definitions 
adequately describe the experience of constipation in a patient with CF  that is relevant for 
clinically and/or research utility .  
Most of the current recommendations for treatment of constipation in CF are based on expert 
practices and guidelines rather than formal clinical trials. Given the lack of clinical data, 
Freeman et al. (18) has come up with an algorithm for treatment of constipation in CF which is 
based primarily on expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_223664] y et in the clinical 
setting. Our proposal would use GI -symptomatology questionnaires to understand the multiple 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_223660]. This would be followed by [CONTACT_223688] -frequency symptoms.

Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 08 JAN 2018  15 STATISTICAL METHODS A ND CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1 General Considerations  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
written, describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan  described below.  
The endpoints of this study are mostly descriptive, with all continuous outcomes such as symptom severity and PRO scores evaluated using descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals. Presence/absence of symptoms will be shown as percentages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals calculated using the Wilson method. Group comparisons will be made via the two -sample t -test for continuous outcomes or Fisher’s 
exact test for categorical outco mes. Except where otherwise noted, all tests will be two -sided and 
statistical significance will be determined at the 0.05 level. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made.   
15.1.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
The analysis population consists of all eligible subj ects who enroll into the study – the Full 
Analysis Set.  For select endpoints, stratification of study results by [CONTACT_551], CF genotype, pancreatic status, and whether sites were DIGEST awardees will also be considered.   
15.[ADDRESS_269183] s 
comparing completers (those who completed all questionnaires at all assessments) to those that are not completers will also be included. To evaluate the representativeness of the enrolled study population, the demographics of enrolled subject s will be compared against the general CF 
population (from the CFF Patient registry) . 
15.[ADDRESS_269184] 
one PRO fully completed  out of t he four questionnaires administered (the PAC -SYM, PAGI -
SYM, PAC -QOL and the disease -specific questionnaire).  The denominator for the percentage is 
the expected number of outside -the-clinic  assessments (# of enrolled subject s x 3 outside -the-
clinic  assessme nts/subject ).   
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Constipation is  defined as <[ADDRESS_269185] week and/or Bristol Stool type 1 or 2. 
The secondary endpoint upon which the sample size is based is the number (%) of enrolled 
subjects with  any occu rrence of constipation during 1 month of  follow -up (the period 
prevalence).  Treatment for GI symptoms and constipation will be summarized based on the 
percentage of enrolled subject s receiving and initiating treatment at time of enrollment visit. To 
evaluate whether CF subject s are adequately treated, the number and percentage of subject s with 
GI symptoms and constipation on treatment will be reported. All GI related treatments will be classified by [CONTACT_47661]/class.  
Protocol GALAXY- OB-18 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: 19 NOV 2018  Page 23 of 32 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 08 JAN 2018  Individual  GI symptoms will be extr acted from the PAC -SYM  and PAGI -SYM questionnaires. 
For each GI symptom, frequency and severity will be summarized at each assessment as follows: 
number (%) of subject s with GI symptom, severity of GI symptom (mean score and distribution 
of severity score)  and change in severity scores from the enrollment visit by [CONTACT_223692] s 
were receiving treatment.  
Mean overall  (and by [CONTACT_26423] -scale) PRO scores for PAC -SYM, PAGI -SYM and PAC -QOL at 
scheduled assessments will be reported including evaluation of within and between subject 
variability .  Group comparisons of mean scores by [CONTACT_1130] s receiving/not receiving treatment and 
by [CONTACT_223693]/without constipation will also be made. Absolute change in PRO scores from enrollment visit to scheduled assessments will be rep orted based on subject s receiving/not 
receiving treatment for constipation.  To examine these effects, figures displaying mean PRO 
scores by [CONTACT_223694] . Additionally, m ixed effects models  for repeated 
measures  will be fit with  PRO scores as the outcome and covariates for visit, treatment, 
pancreatic status, age group and the interaction between treatment and visit. 
Alternative definitions of constipation that are CF specific will be created based on different 
frequencies of bowel movement  and Bristol stool type evaluated individually or in combination. 
Spearman correlations of stool frequency with the PAC -SYM score and Bristol stool type with 
PAC -SYM scores will be examined. The different constipation definitions will be evaluated by  
[CONTACT_223695] (ROC curve) for PAC -SYM scores. The percentage of subject s reporting constipation based on self -
assessment and the concordance to the protocol definition/alternate definitions will be made using Cohen’s kappa coefficient.  
15.[ADDRESS_269186] enrolled, an interim review  will be conducted by [CONTACT_223696]. The Advisory Committee 
decision to continue to enroll or stop will be made in consideration of several factors including 
but not limited to: overall rate of enrollment, adequate representation of sub -populations, missing 
PRO data, an d prevalence of constipation as well as  estimates of PRO variability. The  two-stage 
enrollment strategy will allow  for enrich ing enrollment based on either under -enrolled sub-
populations or on the observed variability of GI symptoms for demographics -related factors  such 
as age -group (pediatric/adult), modulator use  or pancreatic status.  In addition to the interim 
review , the TDNCC will continuously monitor enrollment and provide the Advisory Committee 
quarterly reports of enrollment demographics.  
15.[ADDRESS_269187] e size estimates for this study are based on two criteria:  
Protocol GALAXY- OB-18 Confidential  
Version #:  1 Version Date: 19 NOV 2018  Page 24 of 32 
Protocol Template:  © CFFT TDN   Effective: 08 JAN 2018  a. To assess feasibility and ensure representativeness of the enrolled CF subjects   
b. To estimate prevalence of GI symptoms (specifically constipation)  
Period prevalence is defined as the proportion of subjects  with sy mptom over an interval of time.  
Estimates of constipation prevalence in CF patients varies in the literature. A recent 2017 
publication (7) showed the period prevalence of constipation over 3 months  was 31% (32% 
adults; 30% children). Another 2010 publication (3)  estimated prevalence of constipation in CF 
patients age ≤ 18 years in the Netherlands at 20% (annual assessment) using the ESPGHAN definition. Note that an epi[INVESTIGATOR_223668] (non- CF) in North America  ranged from 1.9% to 27.2% with most estimates from 
12%-19% (19). Therefore, 10% will serve as the lower bound estimate of constipation 
prevalence. The sample size estimate  for CF patients in the GALAXY study is based on a 
prevalence of constipation over a 1 month period in the 20% -  30% range (25% averag e). 
Sample size estimates are based on 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) half -widths (i.e., width of 
one arm of the 95% CI) for proportions.
 While constipation is one symptom of interest, it is 
difficult to specify an exact prevalence estimate over a [ADDRESS_269188] and will occur at varying rates. Therefore, the figure below  shows what the sample size 
(y-axis) is for varying half -width  sizes (x -axis) when prevalence estimates range between 10% to 
50% (maximum).  Approximately 400 subjects are needed to estimate a prevalence of 
constipation of 25% with a 95% C.I.  half -width of 4.5% (95% C.I. = 20.5%, 29.5%) and 
assuming a 12% missing dat a rate
.

16.2 Data Management Procedures  
TDNCC utilizes Medida ta Solutions, Inc. (Medidata) Rave for their study database. The 
Medidata Rave EDC system is designed to be US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) [ADDRESS_269195]’s visit onto electronic CRF screens via a web browser.  Study subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_93745], but will be identified by a unique subject identification number.  Only study personnel at the individual sites will be able to link the study ID to the subject’s name.  TDNCC also utilizes 
the Medidata Rave eCOA/ePRO system, a regulatory compliant system which allows subjects in a study using Medidata Rave EDC  to complete and submit forms and data for patient -reported 
outcomes electronically on a mobile device to the Medidata Rave EDC System. Study personnel at each site will register study subjects using their unique subject identification number which generat es an activation code unique to that subject. Study site personnel provide the subject with 
their activation code. The study subject downloads the Medidata Rave eCOA/ePRO app to their mobile device and uses their unique activation code to create their ePRO  login and password.   
The Biostatistics and Clinical Data Management group of the TDNCC will be responsible for data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation.  Database lock will occur once quality assurance procedures have been completed.  All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing practices for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.   
16.[ADDRESS_269196] eCOA/ePRO system s are hosted by [CONTACT_51580]; the data are stored at 
Medidata’s primary data center in Houston, [LOCATION_007], with fail -safe data centers in New Jersey.

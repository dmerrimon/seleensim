Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/[ADDRESS_350470] drugs (PWID) in the US.29,[ADDRESS_350471] been proven to be efficacious in a rigorous, large 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) .39-[ADDRESS_350472] of “Change the Cycle” 
(CTC),7,[ADDRESS_350473] in injection initiations of non-injectors. This approach is informed by [CONTACT_287352], which 
postulates that people learn behaviors through interaction, observation, behavioral experimentation, and 
reinforcement.1,2 These constructs are all highly relevant to the prevention of injection initiati on; existing 
research convincingly demonstrates that in teractions  with active PWID who describe injection, observations of 
injection drug use, and reinforcing conversations that promote the advantages of drug injection (e.g., the better 
“high” to be gained from injecting) contribute to injection initiation.45-[ADDRESS_350474] found that between 68% and 88% of non-injectors were assisted in their first 
injection by [CONTACT_287353].48,[ADDRESS_350475] to 
non-injectors ( interaction), injecting in front of non-injectors (observation), speaking positively about injection 
drug use ( reinforcement), and assisting in first injection ( experimentation) coul d be a promising approach for 
reducing uptake of injection drug use.   
CTC uses the Information-Motivation-Behavioral skills (IMB) model3,4 to achieve changes among active 
PWID through seven short modules. Information and motivational domains are addressed in guided 
conversations about (1) their own first injection epi[INVESTIGATOR_287321], (2) past experiences initiating 
injection-naive people and consequences, (3) health, legal, and social risks related to injection drugs, (4) 
health, legal, social risks of initiating people, and (5) identifying their own behaviors that might promote 
injection among others. The behavioral skills domain is addressed through a (6) skill -building discussion and 
rehearsal of responses to possible initiation scenarios, and (7) safer injection education. CTC pi[INVESTIGATOR_287322] d significant reductions in injection initiation epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; however, the study did not have a control 
group.7 Our specific aims are:  
Aim 1 : To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of non-inje ctors initiated into injection  (counts) 
by [CONTACT_287354]. Hypothesis 1:  PWID who receive CTC will report initiating fewer non-injectors into drug injection 
at 6 and 12 months as compared with PWID in the equal attention control condition.  
Aim 2 : To test the efficac y of CTC on reducing the number of times PWID are asked  to initiate (counts) 
someone into injection. Hypothesis 2: PWID who receive CTC will report having been asked fewer times to 
initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months as compared with PWID in the equal attention 
control condition.  
Aim 3: To test whether injection initiation social learning risks (injecting in front of, describing injection to, 
and speaking positively about injection to non-injectors) act as mediational mechanisms  for the efficacy of 
the CTC intervention on initiation and request-to -initiate outcomes. Hypothesis 3: Social learning variables 
will significantly mediate the association between the CTC intervention and epi[INVESTIGATOR_287323] [ADDRESS_350476] elucidation interviews with up to 100 
PWID for purposes of providing preliminary data on key iss ues related to 1) Hepatitis A  and C risk, needs, and 
services collected through a quantitative surv ey, and 2) experiences with drug effects and withdrawal and 
symptoms management in a qualitative audio-recorded interview. 
 The elucidation interview topi[INVESTIGATOR_287324].  A brief justificat ion for each topic is provided below.  1) HCV/HAV module: A recent outbreak of 
HAV in Los Angeles highl ighted the inadequacy of both sanitation services (toilets and showers) for homeless 
populations i n Los Angeles and HAV vaccination interventions  
(http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eprp/Health%20Alerts/DPH%20HAN%20Hep%20A%20Outbreak%20091917.
pdf).  Items related to the HAV wil l include access to toilets and showers, HAV vaccination,  and preferences for 
sanitation services for homeless PWID.  New direct-acti ng HCV treatments are now available, but inducing and 
completing treatment for PWID has proven to be difficult.  Items on  knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and 
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/2016  
 4 preferences for HCV treatment will be asked of participants.   2) Drug effects and withdrawal module: Anaylses 
of our prior study data (2011-13) indicated that polyroute (injection and non-injection -71%) and polysubstance 
(use of two or more illicit substance – 70%)  use was common in our sample, yet little is known about reasons 
for specific drug use co mbination and/or sequences.  To begin to understand these common phenomena, we 
will ask op en-ended items on common drug use combinations and sequences and elicit reasons for using 
substances in these c ombinations or sequences .  Lastly, preliminary data from the baseline interviews indicate 
that withdrawal symptoms in the last 6 months were reported by 85% of eligible heroin users and 54% of 
methamphetamine users.  Management of withdrawal symptoms by [CONTACT_287355].  We will ask open-ended (i.e., qualitative) 
questions about how PWID handle withdrawal symptoms when they occur.  Study resuls will contribute to 
efforts to a ddress HAV and HCV infections and to inform substance use treatment approaches.  Participants 
will be offered the opportunity to complete the Hepatitis survey and the qualitative interview separately.  We have developed separ ate consent forms for each.  Participants will be selected by [CONTACT_287356].  Participants will be 
given $[ADDRESS_350477] drugs (PWID) who report having initiated someone or having 
injection initiation social learning risks in the past 6 months (N=1,076) will be randomly assigned to receive 
CTC or an equal attention control condition in Los Angeles (LA) and San Francisco (SF), CA. Injection initiation 
and injection initiation social learning variables will be 
collected at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. CTC is 
brief, easy to implement, and novel in its focus on active PWID as a conduit for preventing injec tion initiation. If 
proven efficacious, CTC will be a m uch-needed, practical 
approach to preventing drug injection initiation.
39-43  
The main outcomes by [CONTACT_287357]: 1) Counts 
of non-injectors initiated i nto drug injection at 6 and 12 
months; 2) Counts of request to initiate a non-injector into 
drug injection at 6 and 12 months; and 3) Counts of non-
injectors initiated into drug injection and request to initiate 
non-injectors at 6 and 12 months. The study will be 
implemented in 2 phases.  Phase 1 involves adaptation 
and training of intervention personne l and Phase 2 
involves implementing the full study.  
Elucidation goals are to better understand issues 
related to 1) HAV/HCV  effects and 2) drug effects and 
withdrawal and symptoms management PWID.  
 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1. CTC training and pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882]. Intervention staff from 
LA and SF will participate in a week -long CTC training led 
by [CONTACT_15957] -I Strike and consultant Hunt. The goal of the 
training is to develop the knowledge and skills necessary 
to faithfully and effectively deliver the CTC intervention. 
Training modules include information about active 
listening, safer injection practices, overdose prevention, 
and risk associated with injection initiation. The peer 
handbook training manual is provided in Appendix A. 
Training will be completed by [CONTACT_287358] (2 
from each site), study coordinator/directors at each site, 
and the MPIs.  Targeted sampling

Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/[ADDRESS_350478] will pi[INVESTIGATOR_287325] ([ADDRESS_350479], 16 PWID total). The CTC information Guide ( Appendix B ) 
was developed by [CONTACT_6283]. Strike and Hunt. Participants will be recruited for community settings and undergo 
informed consent prior to undergoing the intervention session (see Appendix C for informed consent form ).  
Each  practice session will be audio-recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_287359]. A brief semi -structured exit interview will be conducted with the PWID participants to 
solicit their input on feasibility, accep tability, and satisfaction with the intervention session (Appendix D ). PWID 
will receive $30 for completing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_287326].  Modifications to terminology used in 
the intervent ion and other minor changes will be considered based on this feedback. Following completion of 
training and pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882], a cross -site meeting with staff from each site and Drs. Strike and Hunt will be held to 
finalize any changes to the CTC curriculum.   
Interventionists will also devote a week to learning and pr acticing the equal attention control intervention 
(see Section 7.0). To prevent interventionist contamination, one interventionist from each site will conduct the 
CTC intervention for the first half of data accrual while the other interventionist will impl ement the equal 
attention control. Interventionists will then switch for the second half of data collection.  
We will also conduct up to 20 pi[INVESTIGATOR_287327] (10 in each site) of the baseline questionnai re (Appendix H) .  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_287328] -identified persons who inject drugs and are 18 years of age or older.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_287329] a private one-on -one session with a trained research interviewer.  Participants 
will receiv e $15 USD for completing the interview.  Information fr om these interviews will be used to revise 
specific questionnaire items for comprehension and clarity.   
 
3.2. Sampling.  We will use targeted sampling methods developed by [CONTACT_287360] ( N~1,200).75-78 This method is a systematic approach to sampling 
hidden and uncounted populations when true random sampling is not feasible and has been widely used in epi[INVESTIGATOR_287330].
58-60 We chose targeted sampling for four reasons: (1) in San 
Francisco, targeted sampling has been found to reach a more diverse population of PWID than RDS;79 (2) 
several unresolved methodological issues regarding the analysis of RD S data could potentially obfuscate 
findings;80-82 (3) in cohort studies, RDS referral chains can get easily broken through loss to follow -up, thus 
requiring a large amount of data imputation; and (4) it is not possible to analyze data across two cities bec ause 
the referral chains cannot extend between cities.  
3.3. Field sites and interview setting.  Data collection will occur at community -based field sites conveniently 
located for PWID to access and conducive to private confidential interviews and intervention sessions. In the 
past, we have rented space in comm unity -based agencies and single-room occupancy hotels.  
3.4. Recruitment and screening for eligibility . Subjects will be recruited into the study by [CONTACT_287361]. The outreach workers 
will walk through specified recruitment areas delineated in the targeted sampling plan, engage potential study 
participants in conversation, and distribute socks, water, other supplies and referr al information when 
necessary. The outreach workers wil l briefly describe the study procedures to potentially eligible subjects. 
Individuals interested in participating will be given a card with the hours and location of the local community 
field site. Upon arrival at the community field site, potential study participants will be taken to a private space to 
meet briefly with the Study Coordinator, who will ask a series of questions evaluating age and ability to provide 
informed consent to determine eligibil ity for the study. Eligible study participants will be given a same-day 
appointment, either immediately or very shortly thereafter for the screening interview. F igure 1 describes the 
participant flow through the study.  
Recruitment for the elucidation sub-s tudy will  be from the parent study.  Participants retur ning for follow -up 
interview or check -ins will be told about the sub- studies and offered an opportunity to participant in one or both 
of the sub-studies.  Eligibility for the parent study will be the s ame for the sub-studies. However, we will not re-
screen potential participants for recent drug use.  
3.5. Eligibility and inclusion/exclusion criteria: To be eligible to participate in the study potential subjects 
must report: (1) Recent injection of illici t drugs (past 30 days) as verified by [CONTACT_287362] 
(“tracks”);84 (2) age 18 years or older ; (3) ability to speak English, and (4) ability to provide informed consent.  
Exclusion criteria less than [ADDRESS_350480] C oordinators.   
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/2016  
 6 3.6. Biometrics data collection to prevent duplicate participation. To prevent duplicate participation, all 
screening-eligible participants will provide the following biometric information: race/ethnicity, age, eye color, 
height, circumference of wrist and length of forearms, and the location of notable scars and tattoos  (Appendix 
F). Use of these measures has been found to be acceptable to PWID and provide sufficient information to 
deter, detect, and prevent duplicate enrollment of participant s.[ADDRESS_350481]. Strike.7 
No biometric data will be collected as part of the elucidation study.  
 3.7. Informed consent. Informed consent will be obtained in a confidential space pr ior to the baseline 
interview  (Appendix E ). The Study C oordinator or research interviewer will read the consent form aloud 
individually to each participant. Questions and concerns will be addressed throughout the consent process. All 
study procedures will be approved by [CONTACT_287363] U niversity of Southern [LOCATION_004].  
Elucidation information consent form s are provided in Appendix L (HAV/HCV) and M (Drug effects and 
withdrawal) . 
3.8. Locator form. For retention purposes , participants  will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_3031] (phone 
number, e-mail address, day -time hangouts), the names and phone numbers of up to three contact [CONTACT_122473], 
and the names and locations of social service agencies they utilize (Appendix B) . Participants will  be 
requested to sign releases authorizing the staff t o contact [CONTACT_287364] (see Appendix J) . They can refuse to provide this information and still participate in the study. 
We have regularly asked and obtained this information in studies with PWID in LA and SF.  No  identifying 
information will be collected from elucidation sub-study participants.  
3.9. Baseline interviewing. Baseline interviews will be conducted in English using computer assisted 
personal interv iew. The interview will occur in an one-on-one session  with a trained research interviewer.  
Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_350482] approxim ately 48 baseline 
interviews per month (24 interviews at each site per month) until [ADDRESS_350483] completed the equal attention control intervention ( Timeline, Table 1 
see below).  
The elucidation study interview s will be offered to current study participants.  Study 1 (HAV/HCV)  is a 
quantitative survey that cover s topi[INVESTIGATOR_287331] (sanitation issues) and HCV  treatment (Appendix  N).  
Study 2 is qualitative in nature and addresses effects and withdrawal symptoms  (Appendix O) .  Procedures in 
section 3.10  to 4.0 do not apply to the elucidation study.  
3.10. Randomization. Following completion of the interview each participant will be randomly assigned 
(using urn,89 see Section 6.0) to receive either the CTC intervention or the equal attention control  nutrition 
intervention session, according to a computer -generated random numbers program. 3.[ADDRESS_350484] month and then a 10% random sample thereafter. 
The Study Coordinator will score intervention fidelity on a standardized form that will include a list of all 
intervention manual components. Interventionists will receive reports from these sessions. If interventionists 
score l ess than 95% fidelity on any session, they will be retrained by [CONTACT_287365] a 95%  fidelity rate is obtained. Given our past 
experience, training plan and oversight, we expect fidel ity to rarely fall below 95%. Participants will also 
complete a short questionnaire on their satisfaction with the intervention session to which they were exposed 
(see Appendix K ). 
3.12. Cohort maintenance and recapture strategies. We will use multiple proven strategies to retain cohort 
members at the 6-month and 12-month follow -up interviews. First, during enrollment for the proposed study, 
we will collect detailed tracking information, as described in Section 3.[ADDRESS_350485] a monthly  check -
in appointment with study staff, which will be held at field sites in the recruitment communities, and will receive a $[ADDRESS_350486] tracking by [CONTACT_287366]
67,90 and found that paying each cohort 
member $[ADDRESS_350487], we will use graduated incentives for the interviews: $15 for the screener/baseline and $[ADDRESS_350488] their study appointments. Study participants will cont inue to be eligible for the study throughout the follow -
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/[ADDRESS_350489] information and not discuss any substantive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  
3.13. Follow -up interviews at 6 and 12 months . Similar to baseline/screening interviews, 6- and 12- month 
follow -up interviews will be conducted using CAPI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a one-on -one session with a trained research interviewer . 
Participants will be remunerated $20 for each follow -up interview they complete.

3.15. Data collection measures . Data collection measures were selected based on their relevance to 
evaluating CTC, applicability to social learning theory and IMB model, and potential as confounders. Items 
from each area are described below and a draft of the baseline questionnaire is included in Appendix H.  
3.16. Main outcome measures  for Aims 1  & [ADDRESS_350492] 6 months. 
This item wi ll be assessed by [CONTACT_287367]: “In the past [ADDRESS_350493] hit (the first time they ever injected)?” If participants respond Yes, they will be asked the following 
question: “How many people (total) have you helped get their first hit (inject for the first time) in the past 6 
months?” Not applicable responses (or No on the first item) will be recoded as zeros for data analysis 
purposes. For Aims 2 & 3 we will ask the following items: “In the past [ADDRESS_350494] time?”  Participants responding ‘yes’, were then asked how many 
people had asked them to provide their first injection. The time frame of 6 months allows us to assess changes 
in the outcome at 6 months (as was done in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) and [ADDRESS_350495] data on sex risk, spec ifically, 
unprotected sex, multiple sex partners, and sex risk by [CONTACT_287368]
91,92 for purposes of determining the 
efficacy of the attention control condition although this is not an aim of the proposed study.  
3.17. Main independent measures  will be inter vention condition: CTC or equal attention control group for 
Aims 1 & 2. For Aim 3, we will also evaluate three injection initiation social learning risks as mediating 
variables. These items are intended  to capture social learning constructs (i.e., observation of behavior, 
supportive interactions, and reinforcement) within the social processes of injection initiation. To capture 
observing, we will ask current PWID the following item: “In the past [ADDRESS_350496] you injected drugs in front 
of someone who has never injected an illicit drug?” To capture interaction, we will ask “In the past [ADDRESS_350497] to someone who has never injected an illicit drug (i.e., a non-
injector)?” To measure reinforcement we will ask, “In the past [ADDRESS_350498] you spoken positively about 
injecting with someone who has never injected an illicit drug?” Each item is a binary variable (Yes/No) where Yes denotes endorsing the injection initiation social learning risk assessed.  
We will also collect IMB constructs related to injection initiation and sex risk . For the information construct, 
we will collect true or false knowledge items on sex -related HIV prevention provided by [CONTACT_287369], Simbayi  
and others5,[ADDRESS_350499] both existi ng and new measures for their 
applicability to this study population.  Drafts of all items are provided in the baseline survey ( Appendix H). 
3.18. Potential confounding variables or covariates will be selected from the following domains: socio-
demographics /economics, current drug use patterns, blood borne infectious disease risks, experimental 
condition contamination, and social desirable responding. Socio -demographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics  will be collected from each participant, including race/ethnicity (with options for multiple 
racial/ethnic identification), age, education, income/income sources, living arrangements (including 
homelessness), and relationship status. Drug use history and current use patterns  have previously been 
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/[ADDRESS_350500] 30 days for the following drugs: crack cocaine, cocaine, 
heroin, methamphetamines, speedball (admixture of heroi n/cocaine), goofball (admixture of 
heroin/methamphetam ines), prescription drug misuse (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], tranquilizers, stimulants, sedatives, 
methadone, and buprenorphine) , and marijuana. The drug use items have been found to be valid and 
reliable.16,17 Injection-related HIV and HBV/HCV risk  will be captured us ing modified items from NIDA’s 
cooperative agreement study of the 1990s (the “RBA”).[ADDRESS_350501] been found to be valid and 
reliable.15,17 Socially desirable response set measure (SDRS -5) contains five items adapted from the Marlowe-
Crowne Form A measure of social desirability. Respondents rank each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 
(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree).97  
3.19. Six-month and 12 -month follow -up measures  will include all main outcome ( Section 3.1 6.) and 
independent variables  (Section 3.17 ) as well as socio-demographic and economic variables that could change 
during the 6 -month follow -up periods (e.g., relationship status, homelessness, income). We will also assess 
contamination at 6-month follow -up interview. It is possible that skills learned by [CONTACT_287370]. This type of contamination cannot be prevented, but it can be measured. At 6-month interv iew, participants in both conditions will be asked if they have had 
conversations with other PWID on a variety of health issues, including injection initiation, initiation injection social learning risk, sex risk, and other items to mask the intent of the question. We will also ask them about 
intervention phr ases such as “Change the Cycle” to assess whether control group participants are familiar with 
them.  A similar approach has been used in other intervention studies among PWID to identify exposure to an 
intervention.
98 We will ask questions about satisfaction with and usefulness of the CTC intervention or the 
equal attention control intervention at 6 month follow -up interview. Lastly, we will ask questions from several 
other domains on either the 6 month or 12 month survey.  The domain lists for items to be included in the 6 
and 12 month survey are provided in Appendix I. 
 
4.0 DRUG/ DEVICE  INFORMATION  
  4.1 Not applicable. 
  
5.0  SELECTION  AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
   
5.1 Inclusion Criteria:  Inclusion cr iteria for the baseline/screening interview are (1) recent injection 
of illicit drugs (past 30 days), as verified by [CONTACT_287371],84 (2) age 18 years 
or older, and (3) ability to provide informed consent.  
5.2 Exclusion Criteria:  Less than 18 years of age, no evidence of recent drug injection , inability to 
provide informed consent, and non-English speaking.  
5.3 Withdrawal Criteria:  Participants who unable to complete either the experimental or control condition intervention may be asked  to withdraw from the study.  Each participant will be given 
at least 2 opportunities to complete the one-hour educational session to which they were assigned.  
 
6.0  STRATIFICATION/DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS/RANDOMIZATION SCHEME  
 
  6.1 Stratification factors. Not  applicable.  
 
 6.2 Descriptive factors. Based on prior  studies with PWID, we anticipate the following 
characteristics: The majority will be over the age of 50, roughly a third will be white, a third will be African American, and 25% will be Latino.  About 25% will be female.  The vast majority will 
be heroin injectors although a third will also report methamphetamine use, and 10% will report cocaine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_287332] [ADDRESS_350502] the 
ball that is chosen out of a hat (for example: blue for experimental and red for control condition), 
but you add a ball from the opposite color as well. The urn design forces balance for studies 
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/2016  
 9 with a large number of confounders as it approaches complete randomization and full balance 
as the size of the trial increases. Consequently, the urn design is not as vulnerabl e to 
experimental bias as are other restricted randomi zation procedures. 
 
7.0 STUDY AGENT ADMINISTRATION OR INTERVENTION  AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT PLAN  
 
 7.1. CTC can be viewed as integration of social learning theory and the Information-Motivation-
Behavioral skill model (IMB). CTC uses social learning theory to explain how active PWID might influence 
directly (by [CONTACT_287372]) and indirectly (through promoting and exposing non-injectors to injection) 
injection initiation among non-injectors.1,[ADDRESS_350503] influences of injection initiation.
3,4 Figure 2, graphically illustrates these theories are integrated within CTC. 
Figure 2. Integration of IMB skill model with social learning theory for purposes of reducing injection initiation as operationalized in CTC. 
 
In the figure, the IMB model constructs of information and motivation (the [ADDRESS_350504] bubbles) reinforce 
each other; enhance behavioral skills acquisition; and contribute to reductions in injection initiation social learning risk (top bubble on the right), requests for injection initiation, and actual injection initiation epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (bubbles below social learning risk bubble). CTC modules  are listed w ithin IMB construct bubbles. We expect 
IMB-related changes to influence social learning risk, including interactions with (describing how to inject) , 
observation s/exposure to injection (injecting in front of non-injectors) , and reinforcement (encouraging i njection 
drug use). Reductions in social learning risk should lead to lower incidence of both requests to initiate and actual injection initiation epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (behavioral experimentation).  The integrated model targets the injection  
initiation social learning risks documented in the literature to be involved in the transition to injection drug use, 
by [CONTACT_287373], motivation, and behavioral skills to reduce injecting in front of, describing injection to, 
and speaking positively about injecting to non-injectors.

introduces  and summarizes  CTC goals  and then delivers  the following seven  modules  in one session:

 7.1.[ADDRESS_350506] developed a single-session, 60- minute Information-
Motivation -Behavioral (IMB) skills -based intervention addressing healthy eating ( Appendix J). Similar to the 
CTC, the healthy eating interv ention uses a one-on-one guided conversation between the interventionist and 
the participant.  The intervention addresses (1) information about current eating patterns and 
recommendations for healthy alternatives (20 minutes), (2) m otivations for improving healthy eating by 
[CONTACT_287374], a menu of alternative change options, a decision 
balance exe rcise, and eating goal setting (10 minutes), and (3) Behavioral Self-Management Component (30 
minutes) that covers  eating scenarios, participant responses, and healthy alternatives to the scenario and the 
participants feedback.  The participant is also remunerated $15 for completing the session.

or RTI where they will be downloaded onto a secure computer. Data files on field site computers will be deleted and the recycling bin emptied. One advantage of using the Questionnaire Development System for data collection and transfer is that in the unlikely event that interview computers are s tolen or the USB storage 
device is misplaced, the actual data files cannot be viewed without a data warehouse module. The data warehouse module will not be installed on computers used for the collection of data or on the USB device. 
Once data is stored on USC/RTI computers, these computers will be maintained in secured, password-
protected folders, accessible only to designated staff through the USC file server. The surveys will be securely 
downloaded and maintained in the database of [CONTACT_287401]. Drs. B luthenthal and Kral have successfully 
used similar methods for data management in other multisite NIDA -funded studies.  
 
Elucidation data will consist of pen and paper survey forms for Study 1 and digitally recorded, qualitative 
interviews for Study 2.  Study 1 forms will contain no identifying information and limited demographic 
information (sex, race, age).  After data has been entered into a data entry form, paper versions of the survey

13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1.  Data analysis will involve (a) understanding the structure of all of the variables , (b) assessing 
whether randomization worked, (c) ass essing and addressing intervention fidelity, and (d) testing the three 
hypotheses proposed in Aims 1,  2, and 3. First, we will employ exploratory data analytic techniques using the 
survey data collected at baseline and the 6- and 12-month follow -up. D isper sion and central tendency  
measures  (e.g., means, standard deviations, medians, proportions) will be calculated for all items . The 
distributional properties and reliability of continuously scaled variables will be examined. We will also create 
longitudinal plots to identify trends in the key variables . We will also assess whether there is any statistically 
significant differential loss to follow -up between the two conditions . Any variable that is statistic ally significantly 
associated with loss to follow -up between conditions will also be included as a covariate in the hypothesis 
testing analyses. Next, we will examine fidelity to ensure compliance to the intervention based on observed 
intervention check li sts that document the receipt of the intervention as manualized, compared with any 
changes that may occur. We can treat fidelity in the model as parameterized as a covariate in the observed 
model. Finally, we will test the three hypotheses.   Similar procedures will be used to determine if the sex risk 
reduction intervention was efficacious.   
Aim 1 : To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of non-injectors initiated into injection 
(counts) by [CONTACT_287354]. Hypothesis 1(H1): PWID who receive CTC will report initiating fewer non-injectors into drug 
injection a t [ADDRESS_350510] structural equation modeling (SEM) using Mplus (release 7.11).[ADDRESS_350511] Poisson count variable with a potential inflation of the number of zeros as there will 
likely be many who do not initiate others (e.g., zero-inflation). This Poisson count outcome can essentially be 
thought of as consisting of two separate, yet interrelated,  processes —one in which the participant engaged in 
the behavior of initiating someone else at all (i.e., binary yes /no) and another in which we assess the number 
of tim es the participant initiated someone (ranging from 1 to j, where j=the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_287339]. In SEM literature, this is referred to as a two-part process for zero inflated Poisson, as SE M models 
these two processes separately as unique l atent processes.100 As this outcome is collected as part of an 
intervention with a baseline (T0) and two follow -ups (T1, T2), the model is parameterized to accommodate 
three time points , following Olsen and Schafer (2001).100 Note that with three time points , the implied model is 
mis-identified given the number of measured variables in the variance- covariance from the observed data in an 
SEM measurement model with an intercept (i) and slope (s) for 3 observ ations.101-103 However, joint modeling 
the ZIP as a two -part process redresses the identification problem, and results in 6 measured variables, one 
for the process in which the participant actually initiated another person (0 for no, 1 for yes) and another  for the 
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/2016  
 14 change/reduction in the number of initiations over the 3 
observation times (1 to j). The first part of the analysis will 
involve characterization of the measurement model for the 
change over time from T0 to T1 and from T1 to T2. As 
shown in Figure 3, the model will include a treatment 
covariate repr esenting the effect of the CTC intervention 
on changes over time for the binary (sU) and count (s Z) 
latent variables, and it may contain other covariates 
identified as having been distributed differentially by 
[CONTACT_287378] -up. 
Note that if there are no differences at baseline in preliminary bivariate analyses, there is no need to include 
a treatment effect on the intercept for the SEM because 
with no differences at baseline, the intercept test for 
difference is lik ely to be non-significant so there is no value 
in risking the extra degrees of freedom. Through model 
constraints, we will also examine specific differences 
between conditions within time points (e.g.,  T1 or T2) and 
between time points (e.g., change over time from T0 to T1). There will be little need for additional covariates  to control for potential inflation of the correlations due to 
recruitment sites, as the targeted sampling will ensure full coverage across the locations where PWID 
congregate in LA and SF. We will, however, explore differences between the two sites, and may introduce a 
control variable to account for large- scale environmental differences between the two sites. To avoid any 
analytic decisions being driven by a desire for a certain result, the statistician and data analysis team will be 
blinded as to whether 0 or 1 denotes  the treatment or control condition until the analyses are completed.  There 
is also potential for contamination, whic h we will assess by [CONTACT_287379], as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. We will follow procedures 
outlined by [CONTACT_287380]-Brown  et al. (2007)  using complier average causal models ( CACE),
[ADDRESS_350512]. Novak in previous publications.105 Lastly, we will compare differences in examining 
the rate of change versus the standardized difference at each follow -up point (e.g., compare counts of injection 
initiation at 6m and 12m) and test for differences by [CONTACT_3004]. The latent change model has more power than the raw difference approach, and we will present differences in our published work if the outcome is sensitive 
to model estimation.     
Aim 2 : To test the efficacy of CTC on reducing the number of times PWID are asked to initiate 
(counts) someone into injection. H2: PWID who receive C TC will report having been asked fewer times to 
initiate someone into drug injection at [ADDRESS_350513] that this one will  estimated using the self-reported counts by [CONTACT_287381]. 
Aim 3:  To test whether injection initiation social learning risks (injecting in front of, describing 
injection to, and speaking positively about injection to non-injectors) act as mediational mechanisms 
for the efficacy of the CTC intervention on initiation and request -to-initiate outcomes. H3: Social 
learning variables will significantly mediate the association between the CTC intervention and epis odes of 
initiating and being requested to initiate someone into drug injection at 6 and 12 months. The outcome variable 
will remain counts of the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_287340] (Aim 1) and the counts of 
request to initiate anothe r person (Aim 2). The mediational models will be specified following the work of Baron 
and Kenny and newer generalizations.106-[ADDRESS_350514] of baseline 
randomization to treatment status on 12-month counts of in jection initiation as the outcome and 6-month 
injection-risk behavior variables as the mediators. The lagged approach can be used as static measures at 6 
months and 12 months, or changes in injection ini tiation social learning risks and IMB skills construc ts that 
precede changes in the number of counts of initiation as outcome. This latter approach is strong in that the change in a variable, created by [CONTACT_287382], is isolated so that it precedes the subsequent outcome. Figure 3. Two-Part Zero-Inflated Poisson SEM  
 
Version date: 02/22/2018 06/9/2016  
 15 There are also techniques for estimating mediational models with only 2 time-points;[ADDRESS_350515] , or enter the mediation mechanisms together into a single model, while examining overfit 
due to multiple mediational paths.110 Omnibus measures of model fit (chi -square, root mean square error of 
approx imation, Tucker Lewis Index [TLI]), and specific path coefficients will be used to assess the treatment 
effect and test for the mediational pathways. The null hypothesis will be rejected if the p value for the variable 
that denotes treatment condition is b elow 0.05. Proposed C o-I [CONTACT_287402] has extensive experience with these 
techniques as part of longitudinal community -based interventions.105,111,112  
13.2. Sample size/ power analyses  
Power calculations w ere estimated using Mplus by [CONTACT_40397] a Monte Carlo S imulation by [CONTACT_57148] a 
synthetic data set based on the expected parameter values, such as slopes, standard errors, and correlations 
among measured variables, for the anticipated treatment effect.113,1 14 Power was estimated assuming an 
intracluster correlation of 0.5, which is similar to our previous NIDA -funded studies.105,112,115 Statistical tests 
were two-sided, allowing detection of effects in either direction, and an alpha of .05 and power at 80%, 
corresponding to moderate effect sizes. Because the outcome is a count (i.e., Poisson), standard errors were estimated as non-normal vi a a sandwich estimator in Mplus.
116 Co-Is Strike and Hunt found that the number of 
participants who initiated people into injection was halved at follow -up.7 Preliminary data from MPIs Bluthenthal 
and Kral’s study in LA and SF indicated that [ADDRESS_350516] that 573 people would be initiated by [CONTACT_287383] 1,076 parti cipants at baseline (286 in each arm). If the number of people initiated by [CONTACT_287384], as suggested by [CONTACT_287385]’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], that would represent a reduction of [ADDRESS_350517] under different assumptions of attrition, subgroups (e.g., 25%  Latino ), sex, 
and age. For brevity, we illustrate power for primary outcome and most conservative —changes in the num ber 
of injection initiation events. We also account for 25% attrition —our worst-case scenario. T o test the three 
hypotheses given our alpha and power specifications, we would need a baseline recruitment of 1,076 (n=538 per condition). We will recruit 1,076 participants to achieve the final sample of approxim ately 800 at the 12- 
month data point.  The sample power for Cohen’s effect sizes for small (2 percentage point difference), medium 
(5% difference) and large (10% −15% difference) effect sizes are plotted in Figure 4, revealing that after 
accounting for attr ition, a final study of [ADDRESS_350518] small (0.82), moderate (0.88), and large (0.99) effect 
sizes.  We also examined power for our mediational analyses in 
which the injection initiation risk variables will be differentially 
associated with treatment assignment. Following data from Co-I 
Strike for the mediational models, we expect that there was a 
37% change in transition from initiation to non-initiation, and a 
38% reduction in the participants injecting in front of injection-
naive people. These parameter estimates were converted to a 
Monte-Carlo simulation in Mplus, and we will have power to 
detect a mediational effect of for moderate to large pathways 
(TxMediator Outcome) . Note that we will not have sufficient 
power for small mediational effects with our proposed sample, 
which may be clinically insignificant anyway.  
13.3 Missing data 
The likelihood of missing data at the item level will be reduced by [CONTACT_287386] . Therefore, much of the 
missing data will likely be due to participant-attrition. We will attempt to gather detailed tracking information to 
mitigate the likelihood of dropout, which has been approximately 25% at [ADDRESS_350519], will also be explored. As the team has done in previous studies, 
separate intent to treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_287387]. We will explore mechanism of attrition, and can explore model -based extrapolations, such as pattern mixture 
modeling to account for data that are non -missing at random and the selection mechanism cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_287388].

Statistical Methods: Principles for the analysis
For a si gnificant result, the two -sided p -value of the comparison of 
responder rates between the treated and untreated subjects at month 12
using the Fisher’s exact test needs to be smaller than 0.05. The 
estimates of the responder rate in each treatment group wil l be 
presented along with the difference in responder rates. Corresponding 
confidence intervals for both responder rates and difference in 
responder rates and p- value for difference in responder rates will also be 
presented.

All safety endpoints will be analyzed descriptively.
Sample size
A total sample size of approximately 150 subjects will be included in 
this study; approximately 100 will be randomized to treatment with 
Sculptra Aesthetic and approximately 50 will be randomized to no 
treatment. Sample size justifications are given below.
Previous data
Since the primary endpoint will be based on a new scale, no existing 
data is available.
Assumptions : Based on what is seen in clinical studies of injectable 
fillers in the facial areas, it is reasonable to assume a responder rate of 
at least 70 % in the Sculptra Aesthetic treatment group at month 12. For 
the no treatment control group, respon derrates up to almost 30% have
been observed in data on file. Based on this, it is assumed that the 
response rate will be maximum 35% in the no- treatment control group 
at month 12.
Sample size calculation
For the responder rate in , testing the difference using a two -
sided test at the 5% significance level will have approximately 90% 
power to demonstrate difference between a responder rate of 70% in the 
Sculptra Aesthetic group, and a responder rate of 3 5% in the no 
treatment control group when the sample sizes are 84and 42, 
respe ctively. Accounting for 1 5% drop- outs, approximately 150 
subjects need to be randomized i n a 2 :1 ratio .

4 D esign of the Study
4.1 General outline
This is a prospective, randomized, evaluator -blinded, no- treatment controlled study to assess the 
effectiveness and safety of treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic for correction of cheek wrinkles . All 
subjects in the Treatment Group and in the Control Group will be followed for 12 months after 
baseline.
Approximately 150 subjects with intent to undergo correction of cheek wrinkles with a  
 on each side of the face will be randomized (2:1) to either 
treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic (Treatment Group) or no treatment (Control Group), [ADDRESS_560253] 15 subjects will be 
Fitzpatrick skin type (FST) IV, and at least [ADDRESS_560254] V -VI.

4.4 Randomization and blinding
4.4.1 Randomization
Approximately 150 subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either treatment with Sculptra Aesthetic
(Treatment Group) or no treatment (Control Group). At le ast 15 subjects will be Fitzpatrick skin type 
(FST) IV, and a least [ADDRESS_560258] group (FST I-III, FST IV, and FST V -VI). Subjects in the 
FST I-III stratum will be further stratified by [CONTACT_384] ; subjects in the FST IV and FST V -VI strata will 
not be further stratified by [CONTACT_441466] l sample size in these groups , randomization numbers 
will be allocated in ascending sequential order to each subject .Randomization will be performed 
using an Interactive Response System by [CONTACT_441467].

The injection technique is at the discretion of the investigator, proposed techniques are:
Antegrade linear threading : also called push- ahead technique as some product is pushed ahead 
of the needle. Once the needle is in place, the product is injected ahead while inserting the 
needle in the tissue .
Retrograde linear threading : the needle is threaded into the tissue at the appropriate depth, and 
the product in injected as a straight line on withdrawal of the needle
Bolus : multiple aliquot injections of the product is injected along a line or regions of the 
tissues
Fanning : a number of linear threads to spread the product over a wider area
Cross -hatching : combines multiple injections of linear threading that crisscross at right angle to 
provide volume in a square shape
6.5.2 Treatment regimen (dose and interval )
Eligible subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive a single regimen of Sculptra 
Aesthetic . A single regimen consists of up to 4 injection sessions with 1 -month (+ 5week s) intervals. 
The first treatment will be administered on Day 1/ Baseline visit. Sufficient amount of study product, 
as determined by [CONTACT_21450], should be injected to achieve optimal correction:
  Optimal correction is defined as at least a one-stepi[INVESTIGATOR_441446]  
t and the best correction that can be achieved as agreed by

  Three additional treatment sessions may be performed if needed to achieve optimal 
correction, as determined by [CONTACT_441472].
Treatment will stop when optimal correction has been achieved and subsequent visits will be follow -
up visits. Treatment will not be performed if the subject has a disease or condition described in the 
exclusion criteria, or an ongoing treatment -related AE that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_441447] a treatment.

2The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe. (Source: ICH -E2A clinical safety data management : definitions and standards for expedited

9 Data Handling and Management 
9.1 Data m anagement
Data management based on GCP refers to the activities define d to achieve safe routines to enter 
clinical data information into a database, efficiently and avoiding errors. The data management 
routine include sprocedures for database set -up and management, data entry and verification, data 
validation, and documentat ion of the performed activities including information of discrepancies in 
the process. The data management process will be described in detail in the data management plan 
(DMP).
The database, the data entry screens and program will be designed in accordanc e with the CIP and the 
CRF template. Data validation will be performed by [CONTACT_83791]. 
Drugs and events will be coded in accordance with World Health Organization ( WHO )Drug and 
medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA )dictionaries as specified in the DMP. Safety 
data (SAE and if applicable AE of special interest) in the clinical database will be reconciled against 
the data in the safety database.
When all efforts have been made to ensure that the data recorded in the eCRFs and entered in the 
database is as correct and complete as possible, the clinical database will be locked. Study data will be 
transferred to SAS datasets, which thereafter will be write -protected. Statistical analyses will be 
generated in SAS using data from the locked datasets.

The e CRF includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, 
to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Study data shall be entered directly 
from the source documents, which are to be defined at each site before inclusion of the first subject .
Authorized study site personnel designated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_162895]. Appropriate 
training and security measures shall be completed with all authorized investigation site personnel 
prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any subject.
The study data isthe sole property of the Sponsor and shall not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate RA, without written permission from the 
Sponsor. At the end of the study , electronic data are kept at the Sponsor and a copy (provided by [CONTACT_83792]) at the study site as part of the Investigator file.

10 Statistical Methods
10.1 General
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) with detailed description of all statistical analyses 
will be developed. 
All study data will be listed in subject data listings.
All statistical analyses, including summary tables and data listings, will be performed using SAS. 
Confidence intervals will be two -sided and constructed at a confidence level of 95%. Statistical tests 
will be performed at a significance level of 5%, and p -values will be two- sided.
All endpoints will be summarized descriptively. Continuous endpoints will be summarized using 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values , for the observed value as well as 
the change from baseline . Categorical endpoints will be presented in frequency tables with number 
and percentage of observations for each level.

Page 64of 7010.2 Analysis populations
The following populations will be defined:
Safety Includes all subjects who were treated with Sculptra Aesthetic 
or randomized to no treatment control group. Subjects are 
analyzed based on the as treated principle (i.e. according to 
the treatment actually received).
Intention -to-treat (ITT) Includes all subjects who were randomized based on the as 
randomized principle (i.e. according to the treatment they 
were randomized to).
Per protocol (PP) Includes all subjects in ITT who complete the 12month after 
baseline visit without any deviations considered to have 
substantial impact on the primary effectiveness outcome.
ITTis the primary population for all effectiveness analyses. The primary effect iveness analysis will 
be repeated using the PP analysis set if there is at least a 10% difference in the number of subjects 
between the PP and ITT sets. Safety analysis is performed based on the safety population set.
The disposition of subjects will be presented in tables and/or fi gures as appropriate.
10.[ADDRESS_560317] characteristics will be presented by 
[CONTACT_3148] g roup, based on the ITT analysis set using descriptive statistics, as appropriate.
10.4 Eff ectiveness analysis
No adjustment to the level of significance will be done; p -values obtained for any endpoint other than 
the primary will only be provided for ease of interpretation of the results.
For responder rat es based on the and GAIS, and percentage of improved subjects according to 
IPR, results for the right and left side of the face combined as well as separately, will be calculated.
Number and percent of s ubjects in each response category for  GAIS and IPR, will also be 
presented.
10.4.1 Primary effectiveness analysis
The null hypothesis will be that there is no relationship between responder rate and treatment. The 
alternative hy pothesis will be that the re is a relationship between responder rate and treatment .
The estimates of the responder rate in each treatment group will be presented along with the 
difference in responder rates. Corresponding confidence intervals for responder rates a s well as
difference in responder rates and p -value for difference in responder rates will also be presented. 
In order to investigate the poolability of the results of the primary analysis across different subgroups ,
subgroups defin ed by [CONTACT_441485], age (≥55 vs <55) , and FST (I-III vs IV -VI)will be used. Logistic
regression models will be fitted which will include the subgroup factor as well as the corresponding 
interaction term (subgroup x treatment) in order to obtain estimates and confidence intervals at each 
level of the subgroup factor. These will be displayed in graphs.

statistical plan arises before DBL but after the finalization of the SAP, the SAP will be amended.
10.9 Sample s ize
A total sample size of approximately 150 subjects will be included in this study; approximately [ADDRESS_560319] 70% in the Sculptra Aesthetic treatment group at month 12. For the 
no treatment control group, responder rates up t o almost 30% have been observed in data on file. 
Based on this, it is assumed that the response rate will be maximum 35% in the no -treatment control 
group at month 12.
10.9.[ADDRESS_560320] at the 5% significance 
level will have approximately 90% power to demonstrate difference between a responder rate of 70% 
in the Sculptra Aesthetic group, and a responder rate of 35% in the no treatment control group when 
the sample sizes are 84 and 42, respectively. Accounting for 15% drop -outs, approximately 150 
subjects need to be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_560321] of 1996 (H IPAA), and the study subject should be made aware of this exception in

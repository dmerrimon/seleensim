UNC PROTOCOL Version 1.2 - Updated September 6  2017 SECTION 1: Vitamin D  Study  Overview 
1.1: Introduction and Background: Understanding mechanisms leading to decrements in lung 
function, the physiologic hallmark of obstructive lung diseases including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), are necessary to inform interventions to improve lung health.  The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, has been implicated in the development and progression of chronic lung disease. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung a nd is regulated by [CONTACT_1996] D levels.  
1.2: Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of vitamin D 
replacement on blood and lung cathelicidin levels in populations at-risk or with established COPD. The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, has been implicated in the development and progression of chronic lung disease.  We hypothesize that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby  
[CONTACT_560391]. To test this hypothesis, we will recruit 
from two sites: 1)  Johns Hopkins (via the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures 
in COPD Study (SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521]) study of individuals with established COPD (NA_00035701: PI [INVESTIGATOR_560371])  and 2) UNC COPD Clinic  for individuals at- risk for COPD (smokers with preserved 
lung function).  This MOP reflects procedures for the UNC  site.  
At each site, w e will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 2 0 vitam in D 
insufficient individuals (10 participants with serum 25 -OH Vitamin D<10 ng/ml and 10 
participants with serum 25 -OH vitamin D between 10 -20) before and after eight weeks of oral 
vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels . Completion of this project directly or indirectly works towards ultimately understanding 
if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can inform who may benefit from vitamin D supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to a therapeutic intervention stud y that will provide further opportunities to improve our 
understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function. 
1.3 Objectives : 
To evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on plasma and lung cathelicidin measures in individuals with vitamin D insufficiency. Our primary analysis will include comparison between pre- and post-supplementation cathelicidin levels using paired t- tests for 
repeated measures  
The study procedures outlined in this proposal specifically  do not include any assessment of 
outcomes related to disease treatment, mitigation, cure, or prevention. We do not assess change in lung function over time, symptom scores, exacerbation risk, sputum production, pneumonia outcomes or any other assessment related  to treatment/mitigation of COPD.   The only outcome 
collected if BAL and blood samples to measure cathelicidin pre- and post- vitamin D 
supplementation (along with standard safety outcomes that are not related to any disease 
process). The lack of any assess ment of outcomes related to diagnosis, cure, mitigation, 
treatment or prevention of disease demonstrates that such outcomes are not the scope of the 
proposed study. 
C athelicidin and Vitamin D Study  
UNC PROTOCOL Version 1.[ADDRESS_736547] Design : 
The design of the study to complete this aim will be in the format of a baseline and repeat 
bronchoscopy after oral supplementation with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly for eight weeks in individuals with reduced vitamin D levels.  The specific study data collection is outlined in the table below.  
•Participants will undergo a screening assessment (visit S0) to determine the presence of
vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25OH- VitD <20 ng/ml) as well as normal renal  function
and calcium levels. Pre - and post-bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_560372].
•If eligible  based on S0 data, participants will undergo baseline bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for collection of lung cathelicidin levels (visit B1) . Blood
for cathelicidin, vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D and PBMC will be collected at this
visit.
•They will then return to the Meadowmont research clinic weekly for eight weeks of
directly observed vitamin D supplementation as well as assessment of adverse events
(visits V0 -V7).
oAfter the initial four weeks of treatment (V4), all patients will be evaluated andhave blood work obtained for calcium level to monitor for hypercalcemia.
oPatients will be screened at each weekly visit for symptoms of hypercalcemia.
•After 8 weeks of vitamin D treatment, serum 25OH -VitD levels will be measured (visit
V8) to ensure increased level prior to undergoing bronchoscopy. Individuals notincreasing vitamin D> [ADDRESS_736548] completed study. Blood for BMP/ calcium level will also be collected.
•A second BAL collection will occur after the eight week of vi tamin D treatment to
measure cathelicidin in the plasma and the BAL (visit B2). Blood for cathelicidin,
vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D and PBMC will also be collected at this visit.
•A [ADDRESS_736549]-bronchoscopy follow-up phone call will occur after B1 and B2
•All procedures will be research related.  A visit window of ±1 day is acceptable for all
study visits except B1 and B2, where a 28 day window is permissible given potential
delay in laboratory results and bronchoscopy scheduling.

UNC PROTOCOL Version 1.2 - Updated September 6  2017 SECTION 4: REPORTING EVENTS  
The proposed intervention study involves treatment of participants with vitamin D with the goal 
of determining if this intervention is efficacious in altering lung cathelicidin levels, and is therefore classified as a clinical trial.  Because this is a clinical trial, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_560376]. Adverse events (AE) will be reported both to our IRB and the Independent Monitor through annual progress reports or more frequently as described below. AE reports and annual summaries will not include subject- or group- identifiable material. Each report will only include the 
identification code. 
T
he Independent Monitor for this study is [CONTACT_560409] at Johns Hopkins ( [EMAIL_10666] ) 
F
or this application, an adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
during participation in the clinical study or with use of the intervention (vitamin D) being studied. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, etc.), or any combination of these. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that results in one or more of the following outcomes: 
•D
eath
•A life -threatening event
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•A persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect
•An important medical event based upon appropriate medical judgment
A
Es will be labeled according  to severity, which is based on their impact on the patient. An AE 
will be termed “mild” if it does not have a major impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor inconvenience, and “severe” if it causes a substantial disruption to the patient’s well-being. AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study intervention. Specifically, they will be labeled definitely unrelated, definitely related, probably related, or possibly related to the study intervention.  
T
he PI [INVESTIGATOR_560377]. 
W
hen an AE occurs, the AE will be reported to the Institutional Review Board at UNC , to the 
funding agency and to the Independent Monitor. Our procedure is for the study coordinator to notify t he Principal Investigators and for the program staff to make necessary arrangements for 
the participant to see a medical provider. Most assessments will occur in research space adjacent to the Meadowmont clinic, and referrals would be made to the clinic acute provider. The Emergency Room is the first choice for emergent care, and we would arrange for transport or accompany the participant as needed.  SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the Independent Monitor and IRB in accordance with requirements.  
U
nexpected fatal or life-threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the IRB 
and Independent Monitor within [ADDRESS_736559] reviewed all AE reports.   
S
tudy progress and safety will be reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_978]. Progress reports, including patient 
recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs, will be provided to the Independent Monitor annually. An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs. In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre-study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all part icipants met entry criteria; (4) whether 
continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771]. The Annual Report will be sent to the Independent and included in the Progress Report to the NIH. The IRB and other applicable recipi[INVESTIGATOR_94706].

SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521]/ BAYVIEW PROTOCOL Version 1. 7- Updated April 20  2016 SECTION 1: Vitamin D  Study  Overview 
1.1: Introduction and Background: Understanding mechanisms leading to decrements in lung 
function, the physiologic hallmark of obstructive lung diseases including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), are necessary to inform interventions to improve lung health.  The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, has been implicated in the development and progression of chronic lung disease. Cathelicidin has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by [CONTACT_1996] D levels.  
1.2: Pu rpose of the Study: The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of vitamin D 
replacement on blood and lung cathelicidin levels in populations at-risk or with established COPD. The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, has been implicated in the development and progression of chronic lung disease.  We hypothesize that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby  
[CONTACT_560391]. To test this hypothesis, we will recruit 
from two ongoing cohort studies at Johns Hopkins, the SHIELD study of African- American 
individuals at high risk for development of obstructive lung diseases ( OLDs ) (NA_00019960: PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_560384]), and the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD St udy 
(SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521]) study of individuals with established COPD (NA_00035701: PI [INVESTIGATOR_560371]). We will also recruit participants from prior COPD studies NA_00009880, NA_00035381, NA_00085617, NA_00068035, and IRB00047215. This MOP reflects procedures for the 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_560385].  
We will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in 2 0 vitam in D insufficient 
individuals (10 participants with serum 25 -OH Vitamin D<10 ng/ml and 10 participants with 
serum 25-OH vitamin D between 10-20) before and after eight weeks of o ral vitamin D 
supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cathelicidin levels  
Completion of this project directly or indirectly works towards ultimately understanding if a readily measurable blood marker, cathelicidin, can infor m who may benefit from vitamin D 
supplementation to prevent chronic lung disease. The results from this application would lead to 
a therapeutic intervention study that will provide further opportunities to improve our 
understanding of the relationship between vitamin D, cathelicidin and lung function. 
1.3 Objectives : 
To evaluate the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on plasma and lung cathelicidin measures in individuals with vitamin D insufficiency. Our primary analysis will include comparison between pre- and post-supplementation cathelicidin levels using paired t- tests for 
repeated measures  
1.[ADDRESS_736587] Design : 
The design of the study to complete this aim will be in the format of a baseline and repeat bronchoscopy after oral supplementation with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 weekly for eight weeks in individuals with reduced vitamin D levels.  The specific study data collection is outlined in the table below.  
C athelicidin and Vitamin D Study  
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521]/ BAYVIEW PROTOCOL Version 1. 7- Updated April 20  2016 •Participants will undergo a screening assessment (visit S0) to determine th e presence of
vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25OH- VitD <20 ng/ml) as well as normal renal function
and calcium levels. Pre - and post-bronchodilator spi[INVESTIGATOR_10239].
•If eligible  based on S0 da ta, participants will undergo baseline bronchoscopy with
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for collection of lung cathelicidin levels (visit B1) . Blood
for cathelicidin , vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D  and PBMC will be collected at this
visit.
•They will then return to the SPI[INVESTIGATOR_560386] D supplementation as well as assessment of adverse events
(visits V0 -V7).
oAfter the initial four weeks of treatment (V4), all patients will be evaluated and
have blood work obtained for calcium level to monitor for hypercalcemia.
oPatients will be screened at each weekly visit for symptoms of hypercalcemia.
•After 8 weeks of vitamin D treatment, serum 25OH -VitD levels will be measured (visit
V8) to ensure increased level prior to undergoing bronchoscopy. Individuals not
increasing vitamin D> [ADDRESS_736588] completed study. Blood for BMP/ calcium level will also be collected.
•A second BAL collection will occur after the eight week of vitamin D treatment tomeasure cathelicidin in the plasma and the BAL (visit B2). Blood for cathelicidin,vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D and PBMC will also be collected at this visit.
•All procedures will be research related.  A visit window of ±1 day is acceptable for all
study visits except B1 and B2, where a 28 day window is permissible given potentialdelay in laboratory results and bronchoscopy scheduling.

SPI[INVESTIGATOR_453521]/ BAYVIEW PROTOCOL Version 1. 7- Updated April 20  2016 SECTION 4: REPORTING EVENTS  
The proposed intervention study involves treatment of participants with vitamin D with the goal 
of determining if this intervention is efficacious in altering lung cathelicidin levels, and is therefore classified as a clinical trial.  Because this is a clinical trial, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_560387]. Adverse events (AE) will be reported both to our IRB and the Independent Monitor through annual progress reports or more frequently as described below. AE reports and annual summaries will not include subject- or group- identifiable material. Each report will only include the 
identification code. 
T
he Independent Monitor for this study is [CONTACT_560409] at Johns Hopkins ( [EMAIL_10666] ) 
F
or this application, an adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
during participation in the clinical study or with use of the intervention (vitamin D) being studied. An adverse finding can include a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, etc.), or any combination of these. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that results in one or more of the following outcomes: 
•D
eath
•A life -threatening event
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•A persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•A congenital anomaly or birth defect
•An important medical event based upon appropriate medical judgment
A
Es will be labeled according to severity, which is based on their impact on the patient. An AE 
will be termed “mild” if it does not have a major impact on the patient, “moderate” if it causes the patient some minor inconvenience, and “severe” if it causes a substantial disruption to the patient’s well-being. AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they are related to the study intervention. Specifically, they will be labeled definitely unrelated, definitely related, probably related, or possibly related to the study intervention.  
T
he PI [INVESTIGATOR_560388]. 
W
hen an AE occurs, the AE will be reported to the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560389], to the funding agency and to the Independent Monitor. Our procedure is for the study coordinator to notify the Principal Investigators and for the program staff to make necessary arrangements for the participant to see a medical provider. Most assessments wi ll occur in research space adjacent to the Hopkins clinics, and referrals 
would be made to the clinic acute provider. The Johns Hopkins Emergency Room is the first choice for emergent care, and we would arrange for transport or accompany the participant as  
needed.  SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the Independent Monitor and IRB in accordance with requirements.  
U
nexpected fatal or life- threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the IRB 
and Independent Monitor within 3 days. Other serious and unexpected AEs related to the

recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs, will be provided to the Independent Monitor following each of the quarterly reviews. An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs. In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre-study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additiona l 
data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771].

vii.infection
g.Participant will be reimbursed in the form of a check, given to  participant 
immediately prior to procedure
ii. Conduct of the procedure
a.Sedation
i.Before sedation, a “time-out” should be performed to verify that  
the patient is correctly identified and is undergoing a  
bronchoscopy.
ii.The bronchoscopy insertion orifice should be ascertained (right or 
left nostril or mouth) and local anesthetic applied in  accordance  
with local practice.
iii.The patient is moderately sedated during monitoring of vital signs 
and oxygenation according to local procedures.

fentanyl) are used.  
1. Upper limits of sedatio n 
a. Fentanyl [ADDRESS_736627] is anesthetized 
with 1 -2 mL aliquots of lidocaine 1% or 2% solution.  
ii. The lower airways are anesthetized with aliquots of lidocaine to 
diminish or prevent coughing. 
iii. The amount of lidocaine instilled should be monitored. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_560390] 500 mg should be administered in a single procedure.  
iv. In order to minimize the use of lidocaine, the inspection of the left 
lung airways should be brief or limited.   
c. Collectio n of specimens  
i. The bronchoscope is advanced into the right mainstem bronchus 
and the BAL is collected by [CONTACT_560399] 50 mL x 2 in the right 
middle lobe (either segments). If necessary to obtain at least 50 cc 
BAL return, additional 50 cc aliquots can b e instilled in alternative 
segments of the RML or anterior RUL, to a maximum of 300 cc 
BAL instillation.  
ii. Return of BAL fluid can sometimes be facilitated by [CONTACT_560406] (< 100 cm H2O), by [CONTACT_560407] r ight lung superior, or by [CONTACT_560402] 
a deep breath and cough.  
d. Completion of procedure  
i. The BAL form is completed which records the results of the BAL. 
ii. The research coordinator should be notified that the procedure is 
completed.  
iii. If the patien t has a post -bronchoscopy fever, the use of anti -
pyretics are advised.  
e. Post bronchoscopy care  
i. The patient should be monitored in supervised environment until 
they have recovered from sedation, and vital signs and oxygenation 
are stable.  
ii. The patient shoul d be instructed not to take any food or liquid by

1.0  Introduction and Background  
 
Infertility affects 10 -15% of all couples, with 1.5 million couples seeking medical 
assistance for infertility yearly (1). Infertility attributable to the male partner 
accounts for 30 -40% of all cases of infertility. The most common form of male 
infertility involves some type of impairment in spermatogenesis (2).  Unfortunately, 
over 80% of men with infertility from impaired s permatogenesis do not have a 
medically treatable cause, such as a gonadotropin deficiency (3).  In men with 
idiopathic infertility, surgical sperm extraction from the testes coupled with in vitro  
fertilization or intra -cytoplasmic sperm injection offers so me hope of fertility; 
however, these procedures are invasive, expensive, unsuccessful in 30 -40% of cases, 
and don’t address the underlying cause of infertility (4).   Therefore, new approaches 
to the treatment of male infertility are sorely needed.  
 
 The es sential role of vitamin A (retinol) in spermatogenesis has been long 
appreciated.  Vitamin A deficient male mice are sterile due to impaired 
spermatogenesis and supplementation of deficient mice with vitamin A restores 
fertility (5, 6).  Vitamin A is requi red for spermatogenesis as it is converted to 
retinoic acid in the seminiferous tubules via the activity of testes -specific retinol and 
retinal dehydrogenases. Retinoic acid is known to mediate most of the effects of 
vitamin A in tissues.  In the testes, t wo retinoic acid receptors,  and , are present 
in both Sertoli cells and developi[INVESTIGATOR_729523] (7 -10), and targeted deletion of these 
receptors in mice results in male infertility (11 -13).  From this work, it is clear that 
retinoic acid plays several essential roles in spermatogene sis, including necessary 
functions in spermatogonial differentiation, spermatid adhesion to Sertoli cells and 
spermiation (14). Given the crucial role of retinoic acid in spermatogenesis, it seems 
quite possible that some men with “idiopathic” infertility have intratesticular 
concentrations of retinoic acid below those necessary to initiate and/or maintain 
optimal spermatogenesis . In theory, poor dietary intake of vitamin A could lead to 
infertility; however, a nutritional cause of infertility seems improba ble in the U .S.  
   
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/[ADDRESS_996418] es.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_729524], there has been relatively little work examining the role of retinoic acid on 
spermatogenesis in humans.  Intriguingly, there is a suggestion that the 
administration of ret inoic acid to men may improve sperm production. During the 
development of 13 -cis retinoic acid (Accutane) for acne, three human studies 
examining the effect of oral administration of 13 -cis-retinoic acid on sperm 
production in men were performed to determi ne if 13 -cis retinoic acid was harmful 
to male fertility. Interestingly, men in these studies had increased sperm 
concentrations during treatment (see below), suggesting that 13 -cis retinoic acid 
administration enhanced spermatogenesis in these normal men with acne (15 -17).  
We recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] [ADDRESS_996419] tremendous significance for our current a pproach to the treatment of 
men with  infertility who could avoid the nee d for testicular biopsy and/or testicular 
sperm extraction.   Because of its widespread use in humans for over 25 years, 13 -
cis retinoic acid is widely available in a generic formulation and could be quickly 
incorporated into male infertility treatment algo rithms.  Ideall y, retinoic acid 
therapy would allow a man to make sufficient sperm for ICSI, dramatically 
increasing his  chances  of fathering a pregnancy.

2.1 Primary Objective :   
To determine the effect of 13 -cis retinoic acid administration o n the appearance of sperm 
in the ejaculation in men wi th azoospermia.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives : 
 
o To determine the side effects and tolerability of  treatment with [ADDRESS_996420] performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_729525].  In this 
study, we aim to determin e if retinoic acid therapy can convert men with azoospermia into 
men with oligozoospermia.  The medication, 13 -cis retinoic acid, is widely available and 
prescribed for the treatment of acne, suggesting that serious adverse events ar e unlikely, 
especially at the low doses to be tested.

area.   All unused study drug will be returned to the University of Washington investigational 
pharmacy for destruction on ce final drug accountability has been performed.  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/[ADDRESS_996424] of 3 periods:  
1. Pre-treatment period (including screening) for up to [ADDRESS_996425] in a fasting state (no food or drink 
other than 4 to 6 ounces of water or non -sweetened clear liquids for a minimum of 8 hours). A 
snack will be provided after the blood is drawn.  If the subject is in a non -fasting state, the 
investigator will reschedule the visit within two days. The investigator will review all laboratory 
reports and file a copy with each subject’s chart and CRFs. The CBC and blood chemistry samples 
will be analysed at the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729529].    
 
The serum samples for measurements of retinoic acid will be frozen for analysis at the end of 
study. In terms of processing, the blood samples will be collected into vacutainers (containing 
serum separating tube gel and clot acti vator) wrapped aluminum foil to prevent light exposure that 
can degrade retinoic acid,, and gently mixed. The samples will be allowed to clot for 30 minutes at 
room temperature before centrifugation at 1000 -2000g for 15 minutes. Following centrifugation, 
the serum samples will be frozen in (light protection?) tubes at –80 C.   
 
Semen Analysis: Semen will be collected after at least 48 hours of abstinence from ejaculation at  
the two screening visits, treatment visits 2 -9, and all follow up visits.  The semen will be  assessed 
for the presence of sperm, and, if present, for  count and motility.  In addition, a known volume of 
semen will be diluted and washed for making smears for morphology assessments.  These 
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 16 of 31 procedures allow for accurate total sperm count and m otility assessments following the WHO 
protocol ( 18).

of the treatment. Subjects who have had study drug will not be replaced, regardless of the reason 
for discontinuation. All efforts will be made to con tact any subject who decides to discontinue 
study participation before the end of study safety procedures (Visit 11). The necessary clinical and 
laboratory examinations planned at the last visit should be performed at the end of the study 
whenever it occur s. The reasons for discontinuation will be documented.   
 
Post-Admission Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may be discontinued prematurely for any of the following reasons:  
 Emergence of a severe condition(s) such that, in the judgment of the investigator, conti nuation 
in the trial would negatively impact the health of the subject.  
 Personal reasons ( e.g. withdrawn consent).  
 Non-compliance with study drug  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/17   p. 20 of 31  Subject lost to follow -up 
 A severe skin reaction judged by [CONTACT_729542] s tudy drug  
 A persistent elevation of serum triglycerides  
 Onset of neutropenia  
 New onset of hearing disorder  
 New onset of visual changes  
 Onset of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or severe diarrhea  
 Persistent, significant increase of liver enzymes or bilirubi n 
 New onset of significant serum glucose elevation  
 New onset of headache associated with nausea and vomiting  
 Persistent elevation of serum calcium  
 Development of kidney stones  
 Increase in the PHQ9 score to >15 (suggestive of moderately severe depression)  
 
 
14. Statistical  Considerations  
 
Data analysis and Interpretation of Results:  The primary endpoint is the  presence of  sperm in the 
ejaculate at week [ADDRESS_996428].  Linear 
regression will be performed to determine if significant relationships between baseline (or delta) serum 
concentrations  of 13 -cis retinoic acid  and changes in sperm quality are present using STATA Version 
10.0 (College Park, TX, [LOCATION_003]).  For all comparisons, an alpha of 0.05 will be considered significant.  
 
14.1 Sample size consideration  
Inclusion of 20  men will allow for an 80% power to detect a response rate of greater than 15% in terms 
of sperm production and allowfor a drop -out rate of 10% at an alpha of 0.05  (The primary outcome) .  
 
14.2 Efficacy  
The primary efficacy outcome is the presence of sperm in the ejaculate of formerly azoospermic 
men.  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/[ADDRESS_996429] from screening to end of study.  All adverse events will be 
recorded and coded using the body system coding of MedDRA.  
 
The incidence of adverse events will be examined b y using descriptive statistics.  Clinical 
chemistries and allied data will be examined for change over time.  
 
15. Adverse  Events  
Adverse Events (AE) will be carefully monitored and an AE form is included in the CRF. Serious 
adverse events (SAE) as defined be low will be reported  on the SAE form included as appendix  #3. 
 
All adverse experiences must be recorded in the study event record of the subject’s CRF, and will 
include the following information (when applicable):  
 Specific condition or event  
 Indication of whether the condition was pre -existing or not and if yes, whether it has worsened 
in severity (including an increase in frequency)  
 Date of occurrence  
 Date of resolution  
 Relationship to study drug as evaluated by [CONTACT_093] (causality assessment). The  
investigator must enter their opi[INVESTIGATOR_729530].  
 Action taken (study drug continued or not) and outcome  
 Seriousness according to the approved regulatory classification {i.e. any event that is  fatal, 
life-threatening, disabling, incap acitating, results in or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is a medically 
significant event, e.g. an intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes, or any other serious 
criteria (cancer, congenital anomaly, overdose, other significant) is considered serious }. 
 
When any serious adverse drug experience, regardless of causality, is encountered during 
this clinical trial at an investigator’s site, the investigator must notify the Study Monitor by 
[CONTACT_729543]. This report must  be submitted within 2 
calendar days from the time the investigator’s staff is notified of the event.  
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/[ADDRESS_996430] to the FDA via fax, all available 
supporting documentation (with subject name [CONTACT_191263]) for serious events, including at a 
minimum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_729531] (where applicable). Additional 
supporting documentation that should be collected whenever possible, to verify the medical 
diagnosis, includes autopsy reports (where applicable), surgical procedure summaries, histology 
reports, and im aging reports.  
 
16. Ethical  Considerations  
16.[ADDRESS_996431] (IRB). The Informed Consent will be translated and 
certified into the language of the respondent as needed.  
 
Under this consent, the subject shall understand that he is authorizing access to medical records as 
required for monitors, auditors, IRBs and regulatory authorities.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_996432] Recruitment  
The subjects will be recruited from UW and Community  Infertility and Urology clinics who see 
>200 such men annually.  The study coordin ator will screen potential subjects over the phone by 
[CONTACT_729544]. Potential subjects who qualify by [CONTACT_729545].  
 
    
13-cis RA for  Azoospermia , v.1, 1/12/[ADDRESS_996433]’s identity will remain 
confidential to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913].  All records wil l be 
kept in a secure storage area with limited access.  
 
18. Investigative  Record Management

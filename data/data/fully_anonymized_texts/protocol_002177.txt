Research Purpose
You are invited to participate in a research study which is designed to determine whether or not spi[INVESTIGATOR_701584], chloroprocaine,  wears of f f
aster than the local anesthetic 
drug, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and results in faster discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit after surgery.
Background:
You are scheduled to undergo cervical cerclage with spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]. Over 90% of these procedures 
at CUMC are performed with spi[INVESTIGATOR_701585] w
oman to be awake, to 
breathe on her own, and limits the amount of medication that crosses to the fetus. Because the 
procedure usually lasts approximately [ADDRESS_952398] common local anesthetic 
used for this procedure. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_701586], because it is associated with a low incidence of a complication from spi[INVESTIGATOR_701587] “transient neurologic symptoms” – a condition where pain and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_45192] b uttocks 
and lower extremities can be experienced for several days. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a long-acting local 
anesthetic agent and therefore has the disadvantage of a prolonged anesthetic recovery that may last a 
few hours. 
Chloroprocaine is a local anesthetic with a fast onset and short duration that may be used for spi[INVESTIGATOR_701588]. Chloroprocaine is currently used at CUMC for spi[INVESTIGATOR_701589], especially for lower extremity orthopedic procedures such 
as knee arthroscopy. It is also used at CUMC for pregnant patients like yourself.

Information on Research
We are doing this research study to compare the onset, action and duration of the local anesthetic 
medications chlorprocaine and b upi
[INVESTIGATOR_701592]. You are being asked to take part in 
this study because you are undergoing cervical cerclage with spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]. About 50 people are 
expected to be enrolled in this study at CUMC. Off label use of an approved drug chloroprocaine is 
being used in an investigational manner (not for the purpose that it is approved for) in this research 
study. This means that chloroprocaine has been approved by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA) for use in nerve blocks, but it has not been approved for epi[INVESTIGATOR_567252]. You 
should understand that although chlororprocaine is not approved by [CONTACT_701595], at 
CUMC and many hospi[INVESTIGATOR_701593], we have a lot of experience using chloroprocaine quite 
safely for both epi[INVESTIGATOR_701594]. In fact the use of chloroprocaine at CUMC between

knowledge, taking part in this study will not hurt you.
Beneﬁts
You may or may not receive personal (direct) beneﬁt from taking part in this study. The possible 
beneﬁts of taking part in this study is that patients in the chloroprocaine group may ha v
e earlier 
resolution of the anesthesia block and have earlier discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit.

 3 Background 
Immunosuppressive therapy with the calcineurin inhibitors (CI) 
Cyclosporine (CsA) and P rograf®/tacrolimus (Tac), have radically changed the 
field of organ transplantation. Ironically, although extensively and effectively used 
for kidney transplantation and other solid organ transplants, CsA and Tac cause 
important adverse renal side effects:  acute and chronic renal dysfunction, 
hemolytic -uremic syndrome, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances and tubular 
acidosis.  
Chronic nephrotoxicity from CI has been implicated as a principal cause of 
post-transplant renal dysfunction 1,2 and it is characterized by [CONTACT_118287], interstitial fibrosis, and focal hyalinosis of small renal 
arteries and arteriol es 3-5. Early reports in cardiac transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118263]. 6 clearly demonstrated the risk of chronic nephropathy with interstitial 
fibrosis in patients receiving CsA. Furthermore, reports by [CONTACT_118288]. 7 and 
Hornerberger et al. 8 demonstrated that end- stage renal disease developed in 
4.3-6.5% of patients receiving heart transplants after 72- [ADDRESS_132098] been shown 
to develop chronic kidney disease.  
In a retrospective analysis, Fisher et al. showed a strong association of 
early ([ADDRESS_132099] -transplant) kidney dysfunction and the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_118264] 9. Gonwa et al. 10 reported an18% incidence of 
severe renal dysfunction at [ADDRESS_132100] was associated with decreased patient 
survival. The increased mortality in patients with non- renal transplants with 
chronic renal failure was recently confirmed in a larger population- based cohort 
analysis 11.  In this study the incidence of chronic renal failure (CRF) in 69,321 
patients who received non- renal transplants was 16.5% and CRF was associated 
with an increase in mortality by a factor of more than four. Risks factors for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_118265]: older age, pre- transplant hepatitis  C infection, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic exposure to CI.  
In renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], complete avoidance of calcineurin inhibitors 
from the time of renal transplant surgery has been associated with increased 
incidence of acute cellular  rejection. Conflicting data is available regarding the 
impact of CI avoidance on long term renal allograft function.  
We recently completed a retrospective analysis that evaluated renal 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118266] [ADDRESS_132101] transplant and assessed the risk of rejection, patient and 
graft loss and renal allograft function. (Please see attached abstract submitted 
and accepted at the ATC 2007).  
 
From this analysis we concluded that, in a prednisone- free regimen, the 
conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to sirolimus at [ADDRESS_132102] of CI conversion (tacrolimus→sirolimus) between [ADDRESS_132103] -
transplant on the incidence of acute cellular rejection, renal allograft function and 
lymphocytes  function.  
 
Primary aim  of the study is:  
to investigate the impact of CI conversion (tacrolimus→sirolimus) 
on the incidence of acute cellular rejection.  
 
Secondary aims  of the study are:  
i) evaluate whether CI conversion (tacrolimus→sirolimus) 
contributes positively or negatively on the renal allograft 
function calculated with e- GFR and proteinuria;  
ii) patient and graft survival ;  
iii) evaluate if CI conversion impacts on lipid profile, incidence 
of hypertension, malignancies, and opportunistic infections 
and post -transplant DM;  
iv) evaluate possible modifications of lymphocytes function 
before and after conversion (t acrolimus→sir olimus)  
v) assess tubular toxicity by [CONTACT_118289]:  
Induction immunotherapy:  
1) Campath®/alemtuzumab (Anti CD52 humanized 
monoclonal antibo dy) (30mg IV), on the day of the kidney 
transplant,   
2) methylprednisolone (500 mg IV) on the day of transplant 
and on day 1 (250 mg IV) and 2 (125 mg IV) post -
transplant.  
No further steroid will be given post -transplant unless indicated by [CONTACT_118290]: acute renal allograft rejection, renal disease that 
might require the use of steroids and other systemic diseases such as 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erthematosus (SLE), asthma.  Patients 
 5 will receive tacrolimus and Cellcept®/mycophenolate mofetil/MMF. The above 
medication regimen is our standard of care for renal transplant patients, and has 
been since 2000.  
 
Randomization 
For this research study, between [ADDRESS_132104] -transplant we plan 
to prospectively randomize 2:1 renal transplant patients to either:  
 
  -Continue with tacrolimus and MMF or  
 
  -Substitute tacrolimus with sirolimus and continue MMF  
 
A total of [ADDRESS_132105] to be able to randomize 275  renal transplant patients into this protocol.   
 
Data Collection  
The following data will be collected at the time of randomization:  
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118267] - such as age at transplantation, sex and race.  
 
Clinical history - Causes of end- stage renal disease, past medical history  
 
Transplant related information-  donor age, cadaveric versus living kidney 
transplant, histocompatibility and cross match data, viral serology, history 
of acute rejection and delayed graft function, use of  induction therapy and 
immunosuppressants, use of  ACEI and/or ARB, level of renal allograft 
function - estimated GFR  (e-GFR(12) using MDRD formula, proteinuria.  
 
Peripheral blood leukocytes  will be obtained from renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] f or baseline (prior to randomization)  lymphocytes  functional 
activity and characterization of  lymphocytes subpopulations by [CONTACT_118291].  
 
Peripheral donor leukocytes  (from living donor patients) will also be 
obtained at the time of randomization. These donor leukocytes will be 
used as stimulator cells to study the functional activity of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] ’s  
lymphocytes  function.  
 
 
Post randomization 
The recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118268]. In 
addition to the baseline pre- randomization labs, at 6, [ADDRESS_132106] occurred as a consequence of the 
switch from tacrolimus to sirolimus.  
 
Biopsy 
Chronic nephrotoxicity from calcineurin- inhibitors (CI) has been implicated 
as a principal cause of post -transplant renal dysfunction and it is characterized 
by [CONTACT_118292], interstitial fibrosis, and focal 
hyalinosi s of small renal arteries and arterioles. Furthermore, chronic 
nephrotoxicity from CI has been documented in all non- renal transplants and the 
chronic renal failure secondary to the use of CI has been associated with an 
increase in mortality by a factor of  more than four.  
 
The present proposal is to identify those subjects already participating in 
this study who are willing to undergo a kidney biopsy with the aim of evaluating 
renal allograft pathology and renal allograft tissue gene expression profiles of the 
two groups of patients maintained on Tacrolimus/ MMF or switched to SRL/MMF. 
Performing kidney biopsies on the subjects who consent for the procedure will 
allow us to address the effect of immunosuppressive modifications on renal 
allograft pathology at  [ADDRESS_132107] -transplant (standard of care) in order to 
establish a baseline parameter for to compare the [ADDRESS_132108] potential important ramifications to help explain the 
mechanisms of fibrosis and tubular atrophy typi[INVESTIGATOR_118269]. All dat a will then be analyzed 
comparing gene expression profiles of peripheral blood (Paxgene tubes are 
routinely collected at the different time points as part of the original 
study).   Based on power analysis, we will perform [ADDRESS_132109] 
randomization biopsies in 70% of the total subjects enrolled in the study 
(approximately 46 subjects from the tacrolimus/MMF group and approximately 93 
subjects from the sirolimus/MMF group).  
 
Donors  
Donor cells are essential in our study to evaluate the effect of diff erent 
immunosuppressive agents alone or in combination on the process of allo-
recognition.  Donor cells from living donors have been being collected (there is a 
specific informed consent form for donors) and will continue to be collected when 
possible.  Approximately  [ADDRESS_132110] consented to research.  
 
Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoints will be assessed on the adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) that are observed throughout the trial.  
 
Treatment of Acute Renal Allograft Rejection  
Initial treatment for biopsy -confirmed acute rejection for all subjects will be 
pulse corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 500 mg IV x 3 days), tapered to a dose 
of 20 mg prednisone by [CONTACT_4475] 7, unless the severity of the initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_118270] -T-lymphocyte antibody (OKT3 or Thymoglobulin).   Recurrent rejection 
will be treated with anti -T-lymphocyte antibody (OKT3 or Thymoglobulin).  
 
Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
The study will be conducted at Northwestern Medical Faculty 
Foundation/Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ Northwestern University and 
subjects will be recruited from the patients seen in the Division of Solid Organ 
Transplantation.  A total of [ADDRESS_132111] 
that 2 75 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_118271]. The study will be conducted in

Subject Recruitment and Screening  
The study will be conducted at  Northwestern Medical Faculty 
Foundation/Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ Northwestern University and 
subjects will be recruited from the patients seen in the Division of Solid Organ 
Transplantation.  A total of [ADDRESS_132113] (IRB) may stop the study at any time and all subjects 
will be returned to taking tacrolimus and followed for safety.  Subjects will be 
informed of why they are being stopped.  
 
Subjects non- compliant with medications and clinic follow -ups will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
 
Subjects with post -transplant complications such as malignancy or 
infections that require modification or withdrawal of maintenance 
immunosuppression will be withdrawn from the study.  
Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
Even though subjects may be withdrawn prematurely from the study, an 
attempt will be made to collect at least survival data o n such subjects throughout 
the protocol defined follow -up period. Such data is important to the integrity of the 
final study analysis, since early withdrawal could possibly be related to the safety 
profile of the study.  If a subject withdraws consent to participate in the study, 
attempts will be made to obtain permission to record at least survival data up to 
the protocol -described end of subject follow -up period.  
 
Study drugs  
Sirolimus  (Rapamune ) 
Sirolimus will initially be given at a dose of 2- 4 mg oral ly (PO) daily. The 
dose will be modified to achieve 24 hours trough concentrations of 6- 10 ng/ml by 
[CONTACT_118294].  This medication will be given in an open label fashion. The first 
dose of sirolimus will be given at the time of randomization to those patient s 
assigned to have tacrolimus switched to sirolimus.  
Mycophenolate Mofetil  (Cellcept )  
Cellcept® will be given at a dose of between [ADDRESS_132114] dose will be given on Day 0 (day of kidney transplant surgery).  
This medication will be given in an open label fashion.  There will not be any 
change in the dose of Cellcept® at the time of randomization unless indicated by 
[CONTACT_118295] (i.e. Neutropenia, GI side effects.)  
 
Tacrolimus (Prograf) 
Tacrolimus will be given 1- 2 mg PO twice daily, beginning Day 1 (post -
operative Day 1).  The dose will be modified to achieve 12 hour trough 
concentrations of 6- 10 ng/ml.  This medicati on will be given in an open label 
fashion.  
 10 Alemtuzumab (Campath)  
The first dose of Campath® will be [ADDRESS_132115] -transplant period.  
 
Corticosteroids  (methylprednisolone)  
Time:      Dose  
Preop (Intraop/Day 0)   500 mg  
POD#1 (Day1)    250 mg  
POD#2 (Day2)    125mg  
POD#3(Day 3)    0 mg  
  
Statistical Analysis  
Once the 2 groups of renal transplant patients are identified, two sample t 
tests will be used to compare differences in continuous variables between 
groups; chi square tests will be used to compare differences in discrete variables. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis will be also performed to identify the 
combination of clinical variable that are significantly associated with the 
development of acute rejection and renal allograft function after conversion from 
tacrolimus →siro limus.  
 
Safety and Adverse Events 
For the purpose of this clinical trial, the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), dated December 12, 
2003 will be used to grade all adverse events.  
 
Definitions  
Adverse Even t 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent 
illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of 
diagnostic procedures are considered to be a dverse events if the 
abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_118296]- serious. A serious adverse 
event  is any AE that is:  
 11 • fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life 
threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may 
jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or 
abuse, a seizure that did not result in in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive 
treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_118274].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be 
regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is 
normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the 
end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -
up is defined as [ADDRESS_132116] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A 
preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examin ation Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality will be recorded as a 
preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event will also be 
recor ded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_118297], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the las t scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct 
each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this 
study.   
 
The investigator will notify t he drug manufacturer, IRB, and FDA of any 
death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
 [ADDRESS_132117] that has participated in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse 
event if any one of the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to 
confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of  a degree that requires active management; e.g. 
change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118275] i n hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118276] a serious adverse event 
unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible 
for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the 
criteria for an adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor 
surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17233] a preexisting condition.  Surgery will not  be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcom e was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118277], unless it is a worsening or increase in freque ncy of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator/member of investigator’s 
team will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as 
appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the 
case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
 [ADDRESS_132118] be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse 
event that occ urs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related 
to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately.  
IRB Notification by [CONTACT_16473] (including follow -up infor mation) 
must be submitted to the IRB within 25 days of the investigator/sponsor’s 
knowledge of the event if this event meets UPI[INVESTIGATOR_118278].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_118279].   
FDA Notification by [CONTACT_118298]/sponsor shall notify the FDA and study drug 
manufacturer by [CONTACT_118299] -threatening experience associated with the use of the drug within 24 hours 
of the investigator/sponsor’s knowledge of the event.  
If a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting, the principal investigator/sponsor will submit 
the adverse event in a written report to the FDA and study drug manufacturer as 
soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_132119] 
conversion from tacrolimus to sirolimus will be stopped from participating in the 
study and will be switched back to tacrolimus.  
 
Subjects that develop significant side effects secondary to sirolimus (severe 
thrombocytopenia (platelets count <50, 000); sev ere hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_118280]; worsening 
proteinuria or severe de- novo proteinuria will have sirolimus stopped and patients 
will be switched back to tacrolimus  
 
Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_118281] -transpl ant infections (i.e., UTI, CMV,HSV, EBV, 
HCV, HBV, HIV,PCP), that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_118282], will be stopped from 
participating in this study.  
 14 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_118283]. This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and 
implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 Study 
Monitoring, Auditing and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a regular 
assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.  
Internal Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
An Internal Data an d Safety Monitoring Plan, is based on the GCRC and 
some NIH guidelines for Data Safety Monitoring.  All physicians associated with 
the Solid Organ Transplant Department are listed as either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_54720]- I’s with 
this study.  The plan approved by [CONTACT_1201] w ould utilize the statistical analyst 
along with the current QA committee to review the research SAE’s and AE’s.  
 
Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_118284] 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject 
authorization informing the subject  of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in 
this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of 
their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior 
to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked 
authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts will be made to obtain permission to 
collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period.  
 
Source Documents  
Source data is all information, orig inal records of clinical findings, 
observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction 
and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents   
Examples of these original documents, and data records i nclude: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2553], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries 
or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_110799], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or 
 [ADDRESS_132120] files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in 
the clinical trial.  
 
Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument 
for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data 
must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure 
was not done or the question was not asked, “N/D” is placed in the space.  If the 
item is not applicable to the individual case, “N/A” is written in the space.  All 
entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, 
forensic co rrection is made by [CONTACT_740] a single straight line through the incorrect 
entry and the correct data is entered above it.  All such changes must be initialed 
and dated.  Errors are not to be erased or covered with “white- out”.  For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, the clarification is written above or 
next to the item, then initialed and dated.   
 
Records Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at 
least [ADDRESS_132121].  
 
Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards 
of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21  part 312 and International Conference on 
Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional 
research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly 
constituted independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), (Northwestern 
University Institutional Review Board), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, 
for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the 
conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this 
decision will be provided to the investigator/sponsor before commencement of 
this study.  The investigator will place a list of IRB members and their affiliate in 
the regulatory binder for the clinical trial.  
 
All subjects f or this study will be provided with a copy of the consent form 
describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an 
informed decision about their participation in this study. This consent form will be 
submitted with the protoc ol for review and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The 
formal consent of a subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be 
obtained before the subject is submitted to any study procedures. This consent 
 [ADDRESS_132122] will be given a signed copy of 
the informed consent for their records.  
 
Study Finances  
This study is financed through Northwestern Memorial Foundation, divisional 
funding, and [COMPANY_007]  Pharmaceuticals (as of March 2008).  
 
Conflict of Interest 
Any investigator who has a conflict of interest with the study (patent 
ownership, royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by 
[CONTACT_78143]) must have the conflict reviewed by a properly 
constituted Conflict of Interest Com mittee with a Committee-  sanctioned conflict 
management plan prior to participation in this study.  All Northwestern University 
investigators will follow the University conflict of interest policy.  The investigators 
will sign conflict of interest document  number ORSP -100, as per Northwestern 
University IRB guidelines.  
 
Subject Stipends or Payments  
All study related laboratory tests (flow cytometry analysis of peripheral 
lymphocyte and functional assays of  lymphocytes  will be provided to the subject 
free of charge). Subjects will be provided with reimbursement for parking on 
study related visits.  
 
In addition, because most of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ donors do not usually need to 
return to this center’s transplant clinic beyond one- year post -transplant, a $[ADDRESS_132123] the results are presented to the scientific community and/or

 This is a resubmission of an application responding  to “PAR-16-365-P ilot Clinical Trials for the Spectrum 
of Alzheimer’s Disease and Age- related Cognitive Decline  (R01) ”. It examines  the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy (HBOT) in improving cognition  in cognitively impaired elderly with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who have high 
dementia risk. It is a collaboration of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, the University of 
Wisconsin, Madison WI, the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Asaf Harofeh Medical 
Center, Israel—one of the largest hyperbaric units worldwide, treating over 100 patients daily —and the Sheba 
Medical Center, Israel (8 miles from Asaf Harofeh).  
HBOT is a treatment in which oxygen- enriched air (up to 100%) is administered to patients in a chamber 
at a pressure above one atmosphere absolute (1ATA), the ambient atmospheric pressure. The combined action 
of hyperoxia and hyperbaric pressure leads  to significant improvements in tissue oxygenation, resulting in 
benefits to the cebrovascular milieu, with improvements in ischemic damage and cerebral blood flow (CBF) . 
Recently, our group published compelling evidence from clinical trials indicating HBOT neurotherapeutic effects  
in stroke, with improved cognitive function and elevated brain activity in SPECT. Additionally, our  preliminary 
data showing better  cognitive performance and brain activity  in T2D subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) suggests potential HBOT neurotherapeutic effects,.  
Elderly with T2D have higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_6124], MCI, and cognitive decline. T2D is a vascular 
disease culminating in tissue hypoxia, so cerebrovascular disease is the primary  contributor to this  increased 
risk. Impairment of cerebrovascular integrity in T2D may lead to reduced CBF on the vessel level, and reduced 
glucose metabolism on the neuronal level,  which may be rectified with HBOT by [CONTACT_531150]. We thus propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the beneficial effects of HBOT on cognition  
and on ischemic injury ( through assessment of  CBF using MRI, and of glucose metabolism  using FDG -PET) . 
We focus on T2D elderly with MCI, who are enriched in cerebrovascular disease and are in the prodromal phase 
of the dementia process, an ideal opportunity for HBOT to protect and enhance cognition by [CONTACT_531151], preventing, or delaying neuropathologic processes that cause cognitive decline.  We will test the extent to which 
60 sessions of 90 minutes of 100% oxygen at 2 ATA —compared with a sham condition—improve cognitive 
performance in the short term (immediately after treatment) and a longer term (12 months after treatment). 
Subjects will be recruited  through talks in the community, advertisements, and companies which have large lists 
of elderly interested in receiving emails about health related topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  In addition, we have a large -scale project in 
Israel (NIA R01AG034087), where 1200 T2D elderly are followed for cognitive decline providing an additional large recruitment source.  
We hypothesize that HB O
 T compared to a sham condition (n=77 in each group) improves cognitive function and 
favorably alters cerebrovascular pathology  (increasing CBF and glucose utilization) in T2D patients with MCI , 
focusing on the following outcomes:  
Aim 1. Cognitive functioning: Aim 1a: The primary outcome will be a composite measure of cognitive function 
balancing tests of both executive and memory function. Domain -specific measures of cognition ( executive 
function and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682] ) will be secondary outcomes.

 Aim 2. Ischemic Injury : CBF at the level of capi[INVESTIGATOR_531110], 
and in macrovessels, measured by a novel 4D Flow MRI technology developed by [CONTACT_27156].  
Aim 3 . Neuronal function: [F18]FDG -PET measuring cerebral glucose utilization. 
Aim 4. Mediation by [CONTACT_531152]. To examine whether CBF and glucose utilization mediate HBOT effects 
on cognitive function. Hypothesis:  inclusion of the biomarkers in a mediation model will attenuate the effect of 
HBOT on cogn ition, suggesting them as underlying mechanisms.  
 
We propose a n RCT examining the short and long- term efficacy of HBOT, a therapy with strong biological 
plausibility for affecting beneficially impaired cognition through vascular mechanisms, in elderly with T2D -related 
MCI,  who are enriched in cerebrovascular disease and a re at high dementia risk . We focus on both cognitive 
and biomarker outcomes, providing context for  identifying relevant mechanisms, and explore factors associated 
with HBOT efficacy , suggesting subgroups who may most benefit from the therapy. The study will be performed 
in Israel, with optimal infrastructure and expertise for all the study components at significantly lower costs. HBOT 
can be widely deployed in the US so if successful, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_531111] a multi- center large-
scale clinical trial for definitive evidence of its benefits to cognition in T2D patients at high dementia risk . With 
the current lack of effective treatments for dementia while the proportion of elderly increases, the accelerating prevalence of T2D and dementia amplify this application’s public health impact. 
 
B. SIGNIFICANCE  
B1. The urgent need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_531112]- An urgent
  need exists to identify effective interventions t o arrest 
or reverse dementia at its earliest stages. Mild cognitive disturbances and pathophysiologic changes associated 
with dementia can precede clinical symptoms by [CONTACT_726] a decade. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) , 
characterized by [CONTACT_531153] /or mild executive dysfunction, is the presumed prodrome of clinical 
dementia. The greatest risk factor for cognitive impairment is age; currently 13% of the US population is over 65, 
but they are projected  to increase by 115% in [ADDRESS_689626] health care expenditures. 
Recent estimates of MCI  prevalence are 10% in 70 year -olds, 20% in 80 year -olds, and as high as 40% in [ADDRESS_689627] cognitive 
decline in MCI —such as cholinesterase inhibitors, vitamins, anti -inflammatories, anti -hypertensives, and 
statins —have been largely negative3-7. A major challenge in understanding and treating cognitive decline and 
dementia is the lack of a firm relationship between cognitive outcomes  and targeted neurobiological  
mechanisms. For example, cl inical trials with amyloid -reducing agents have succeeded at target engagement , 
but failed to cause clinical benefit for Alzheimer’s disease ( AD). Thus , novel disease modifying strategies —such 
as hyperbaric  oxygen therapy ( HBOT )—with  strong biological plausibility to benefi t cognition in aging, must be 
investigated.

B2. The primary underlying mechanism for HBOT benefits on cognition is cerebrovascular - HBOT  i s a treatment 
in which oxygen -enriched air (up to 100%) is administered to patients in a chamber at a pressure above one 
atmosphere absolute (1ATA), which is the ambient atmospheric pressure. For the peripheral vasculature, a well -
accepted indication of HBOT is hypoxia- induced foot ulcers ; there is broad evidence suggesting significant 
improvements through stimulation of vessel repair processes and angiogenesis8, 9.  Similarly, in the brain, b ased 
on current evidence  in 1) animals, 2) small clinical trials in humans, and 3) our own stroke clinical trial (see D1a ), 
the combined action of hyperoxia and hyperbaric pressure of  HBOT improves hypoxia/ischemic injury and 
consequently cerebral blood flow  (CBF)  leading to cognitive improvements10, 11. Angiogenesis is induced by 
[CONTACT_531154]- inducible factor -1α (HIF-1α)12, [ADDRESS_689629] area17 and  improves CBF in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_531113]18. Small HBOT 
studies performed on humans also support our hypotheses19 and proposed mechanism of action. In a 
randomized clinical trial ( RCT), HBOT treatment as an adjuvant to donepezil showed improved cognitive 
performance compared with donepezil alone in vascular dementia patients20. Similarly, HBOT had positive 
effects compared to hyperbaric air on neurological and cognitive outcomes in a small (n=26) controlled trial of patients with cerebrovascular disease (patients, but not investigators, were blind to the study condition)
21. More 
recently, HBOT —compared with normobaric oxygen—was associated with increased CBF in frontal and 
temporal regions in healthy subjects22. Finally, our clinical trial on post -stroke patients show ed enhanced CBF 
and cognition following HBOT. On the neuronal level, it is well established that glucose utilization is impaired in 
ischemic cortical regions23-25. In animal models there is growing evidence for improved neuronal hypometabolism 
with HBOT26-28, suggesting that intracellular bioavailability of oxygen attenuates the deleterious effects of 
ischemia on neuronal glucose utilization29. The evidence thus supports investigation of CBF (using MRI) and 
glucose utilizati on (using FDG -PET) as biomarker outcomes of HBOT in T2D patients , who are enriched in 
cerebrovascular disease.    
 B3. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients are at high risk for  cogni t
 ive compromise- T2D is  consistently associated 
with risk for cognitive decline30, MCI31, and dementia32-34. Its average onset at 5535, 15-35 years before dementia 
onset, provides a window of opportunity for prevention. T2D is diagnosed in 26 % of those above age 65 in the 
US; over half have T2D or “pre -T2D”36, an enormous number at high risk for cognitive compromise. T2D affects 
multiple domains of cognitive function, primarily  executive functions37 and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682]38. The primary 
outcome of the proposed RCT is a summary measure of these cognitive domains, with the executive function 
and epi[INVESTIGATOR_531114].

 B3a. T2D affects cognition primarily through cerebrovascular mechanisms- Increased risk for vascular pathology 
in T2D39 gives strong biological plausibility to involvement of cerebrovascular pathology in the association of T2D 
with dementia. B rain MRI show s cerebrovascular abnormalities in T2D patients :  stroke40, lacunar infarcts41, 
microbleeds42, white matter hyperintensities43, reduced CBF44, [ADDRESS_689631] been associated with brain 
hypometabolism as measured by [F18]FDG -PET49—a proxy for neuronal activity50—and our group has found 
significant and widespread reductions in glucose metabolism with higher levels of insulin resistance among late -
middle- aged individuals (see Figure 5).  
 
B3b. T2D patients have smaller brain volume but not more amyloid pathology: Elderly subjects with T2D have 
smaller total brain51-[ADDRESS_689632] relevance to the potential  HBOT  beneficial effects  to T2D , 
CBF in small vessels (measured by [CONTACT_531155] ), and neuronal hypometabolism ( measured by [CONTACT_6789] -PET).   
 B4. Rationale for use of HBOT in T2D- related  M
 CI- As described above, current evidence strongly supports a 
vascular pathology mechanism underlying cognitive compromise in T2D . While the bulk of the evidence fails to 
support more AD neuropathology in T2D than in non- T2D, AD neuropathology is present in T2D. This is important 
since HBOT benefits on the brain are primarily through a vascular mechanism and improvement in vascular 
function may have downstream beneficial effects on tau and amyloid69, 70. We focus on T2D patients, who are 
enriched in cerebrovascular pathology, and thus may be strong candidates for improvements by [CONTACT_531156]. The enriched levels of neuropathology
71nand the long prodromal period of MCI provide an ideal opportun ity for HBOT 
to protect  or enhance cognition by [CONTACT_531151], preventing, or delaying neuropathologic processes that cause 
cognitive decline.  Importantly, t his application responds to  the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease 
(NAPA) [ADDRESS_689633], 2020

C. INNOVATION  
As the US prevalence above age 65 increases by 2050 to an alarming 28%36 for T2D and 20% for dementia73,  
finding  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_531115]  T2D is imperative.   
C1. First study of HBOT in MCI  at hig h risk due to T2D -This is the first RCT of HBOT  in MCI patients  with 
particularly  high dementia risk due to  comorbid T2D. In contrast to many unsuccessful pharmacolo gic 
approaches , it innovates by [CONTACT_66567]  a relatively safe, non -pharmacologic therapy with strong biological 
plausibility , and solid preliminary data  for positive effects on clinical symptoms , and on vascular markers. The 
design includes short -term (immediately post -treatment) and long er-term ([ADDRESS_689634] -treatment) outcomes, 
to investigate the legacy effects  of HBOT over time.  
 
C2. Innovative design  an d cognitive outcomes - In the context of cognitive impairment, t his will be the first HBOT 
RCT with a parallel sham condition, rather than a cross -over design (which does not permit  evaluat ing long-
term effects of HBOT ), or HBOT as an adjuvant to donepezil20 (without a sham  condition ). The sham control 
creates identical conditions to the HBOT treatment (noises, mask on face, nurse in the chamber, etc.), except 
for hyperbaric pressure. The overall cognition primary  outcome includes a balanced combination of four tests of 
executive functions and four tests of epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682], cognitive domains characteriz ing T2D-related cognitive 
compromise . Both domains have benefitted from HBOT74, [ADDRESS_689635] well computerized medical 
charts. Thus , upon participant’s  approval , we will request historical  information on diagnoses,  blood tests, and 
medications.  Explor ing factors  (e.g. T2D microvascular complications) potentially associated with HBOT efficacy 
(see D6) is valuable in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] , to identify groups that benefit most , refining  the design for a large- scale multi -
center RCT.

patients, feasibility and rationale for the use of FDG -PET as a biomarker outcome in this study,  clinical and 
neuroimaging capabilities at the Sheba Medical Center, available infrastructure of the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline study, and a summary of the study team’s expertise  and well -coordinated long- term 
collaboration,  fully supporting the successful execution of the proposed 
RCT.   
 
D1a. HBOT induces neuroplasticity in post stroke patients - Random i
 zed 
prospective trial78- Patients  6-36 months after stroke (n=74)  were randomly 
assigned to a “treated” or “crossed” group. Brain activity (by [CONTACT_531157] ), neurologic functions (by [CONTACT_531158]) , activities of daily 
living and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after HBOT  (40 90 -
minute sessions, 5 days/week, 100% oxygen at 2ATA). Patients in the crossed  group were also assessed after  an initial two months control period 
of no treatment.  Neurological functions , ADL,  and quality of life improved 
significantly fol lowing HBOT sessions , but with  no improvement after  the crossed group control period. Elevated 
brain activity was detected mostly in regions of live cells (as confirmed by [CONTACT_4654]) with low activity (based on SPECT) 
(Figure 1). This highlights  the advantage of our design, examining MCI subjects , who may have compromised 
neuronal and vascular function due to their T2D but  are not demented yet, suggesting substantial brain tissue 
has the potential to recover.

Version  9.[ADDRESS_689637] stroke by [CONTACT_531156]  75- This study address ed HBO T effects  on memory  
impairment after stroke at late chronic stages  in a retrospective analysis of 91 stroke patients 18 years or older 
(mean 60 years)  who had either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 3– 180 months (M  30– 35 months)  before HBO T 
(40 to 60 90-minute sessions, 5 days /week, 100%  oxygen 
at 2ATA ). Memory tests before and after HBO T therapy 
used the NeuroTrax  computerized testing battery  (verbal or 
nonverbal, immediate or delayed memory ). In all tests there 
was a statistically significant improvement after HBOT (all 
p-values <.0005, effect sizes medium to large), largest in 
immediate ( 28% improvement) and delayed ( 27%) verbal 
memory, respectively  (Figure 2). SPECT before and after 
HBOT  (n=56) showed s everal regions  had significantly 
higher relative change in activation, particularly in temporal lobe (entorhinal cortex, inferior and middle temporal gyri). These  results support strongly the potential of HBOT to improve cognition and brain activation even years after 
the acute event. Of note, Drs. Efrati and Beeri co- authored this paper,  illustrating  their productive collaboration.

In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] f or proof of concept, two T2D MCI patients 
were treated using the proposed HBOT protocol. The o verall 
cognition  measure improved by 32.6% (from 0.99 to 1.47) 
and 30.0%  (from 0.81 to 1.15) for subject 1 and 2, 
respectively ; SPECT results show ed substantial 
improvements in CBF  in broad cortical regions (see Figure  
3, subject 1 ). The provocative results of this  very small pi[INVESTIGATOR_531117].

in metabolic syndrome48- [CONTACT_531185], our neuroimaging collaborator, 
compared CBF using arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI ( ASL-MRI) 
in middle -aged adults (n=69; mean age=60.4) with and without the 
metabolic  syndrome (a pre- T2D condition). Mean gray matter CBF 
was 15% lower in the metabolic syndrome group  (Figure 4).   Voxel -wise image 
analysis indicated that this decrease pert ained to a large portion of the cortical 
surface. The poorer memory in t he metabolic syndrome group was partially 
mediated by [CONTACT_531160] . These findings demonstrate feasibility of the proposed ASL-MRI and its sensitivity to the pre -

Bendlin’s group examined the association of insulin resistance (using HOMA -IR) with global and regional 
FDG -PET uptake in 150 middle- aged 
adults. Higher insulin resistance (a pre -
T2D condition) was associated with 
lower FDG -PET uptake ( Figure 5); uptake 
in regions more strongly associated with insulin resistance (such as medial temporal lobe) was associated with cognitive 
function ( Figure 6). These results show 
relationships of a T2D characteristic 
(insulin resistance) with regional glucose uptake  supporting its use  as a biological outcome in the proposed 
study.  
 D1f. The Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline Study (IDCD)
80-85- This prospective population- based longitudinal 
study , to identify T2D -related characteristics linked  with cognitive decline, has cognitive, functional, demographic, 
psychiatric, DNA, and inflammatory marker assessments every 18 months. T2D subjects from Maccabi (n=1200) were initially cognitively normal, 65+, averaging 73 years old at baseline, 13 years of education, and 10 years of 
T2D in the Diabetes Registry; 42% were women. All subjects approved, through their informed consent, to be approached for other relevant studies, providing an opportunity to approach them for this RCT. The IDCD rate 
of cognitive decline is used to calculate statistical power.

Harofeh Medical Center; informed consent and all other assessments, including cognitive, functional, MRI, and FDG -PET will be performed at the Sheba Medical Center. Adverse event monitoring is done at every HBOT and 
sham session, by a nurse in the chamber throughout the session and a physician always present. P hysical 
exams and blood collection for safety monitoring will occur before randomization, and at 12 weeks . Medication 
review will occur before randomization, before and after the intervention, and 6 and 12 months later, with 
cognitive testing at these times except before randomization. The T2D -related biomarkers ( Blood test,  MRI ASL  
and FDG -PET) will be assessed before and after the intervention, and 12 months later. After intervention, a 
questionnaire will examine whether blindness was maintained. At the end of the participant's 12 months' 
participation in the trial, the participant can choose to receive HBOT treatment for which the costs will be covered by [CONTACT_3476]. At the end of the second HBOT treatment course, an additional neuropsychological assessment will be administered to the participants. Table 2 - Summary of study procedures

The intervention will begin within three weeks  after the Baseline assessments and end at 12 
weeks after 60 HBOT/Sham treatments.  A physician is always  present during the HBOT sessions, 
and a nurse is in the chamber throughout the whole treatment, so adverse events will be de facto closely monitored at  each session up to the end of the intervention.  
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689645] 3 subjects  from one of the interventions is filled, 
the intervention for that cluster will begin (77 subjects will be recruited for each treatment ). Clusters will be a 
random effect in the analyses (see D6 ). Three study technicians  who activate HBOT or sham protocol  sessions  
will be the only unblinded staff  who have the key for the subjects’ group assignment s. All subjects and other 
clinic staff will remain blinded to group assignment. Study nurses  will monitor AEs during all sessions  and a 
physician will be present during each session.  Importantly , staff from Sheba, who assesses  outcomes , will not 
be exposed to the subjects dur ing their  intervention and vice- versa . 
Procedures before en rollment will maximize participant adherence to the intervention. Only volunteers 
who fully understand the expectations regarding consistent participation in the treatment  and completion of 
assessments will be enrolled. The judgment of field site staff will be essential to determine eligibility based on anticipated adherence. During initial telephone screening and again prior to the baseline visit, subjects will be asked to confirm their willingness to be assigned to either intervention. [CONTACT_531188]’s group has long experience 
with RCTs using HBOT conditions , ensur ing subject satisfaction and continued commitment to the program.

who stays throughout the session ( a significant advantage compared to the monoplace chamber) . The HBOT  
protocol is 90 minutes, 5 times/week, 60 sessions, 100% oxygen at 2 ATA  with 5 minute air breaks every 30 
minutes . This safe protocol  is used worldwide for treatment of ischemic non- healing wounds ( diabetic f oot or 
post radiation injury) , was used in our stroke clinical trial78, and in our MCI preliminary data, indicating favorable 
cognitive outcomes . It improves on  a prior study on memory -impaired elderly89 that was too short to  reduc e 
ischemic injury or for angiogenic processes to occur, even in peripheral tissue90-92.  
The team members pre sent at all times during the HBOT/sham sessions are a physician, two nurses 
(one inside the chamber and one out side), and at least one of the three unbl inded technicians. Only study 
subjects —not clinical patients —are in the chamber during research hours. When subjects arrive at the 
Hyperbaric Unit , one of the nurses  signs them  in; measures their glucose, blood pressure, heart beat, and 
temperature; and ask s about  any change in their medical condition. Subjects with signs of any infectious  disease 
(such as upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]) , or arriving with systolic blood pressure >170mmHg or <90mmHg, or 
glucose <75mg/dl  do not enter until it improves. While in the chamber, subjects may  drink, read, write, sleep, 
hear music with headphones , or watch TV.  Video games , laptops, phones, or other  electronic devices  are not 
allowed in the chamber . Subject s have their  own mask s. The atmospheric pressure goes up to 2.[ADDRESS_689646] five minutes of the session, with  a noise of circulating air. S ubjects will feel pressure in their ears ; the 
nurse will advise releasing the pressure by [CONTACT_275246][INVESTIGATOR_531121] (closing their nose wit h their finger s and pushing 
air). In the last five minutes  of the session, the pressure is  slowly decreased to 1ATA.

D2f. Sham intervention- Sham w as  selected as the control condition rather than “usual care” to equate 
intervention groups with respect to other variables that could influence cognition and functional status , such as  
a new challenge (completing an activity program), peer socialization, and attention from staff.   
Except for pressure, all the conditions of the HBO T  intervention are  provided in the sham intervention 
(nurse measures vitals and asks about  health before ent ering  the chamber, time in the chamber, number of 
sessions per week  and overall, nurse in the chamber at all times, mask on the face, etc.). In contrast to [ADDRESS_689648] minutes of the session with 
noise of circulating air . This  provides a minimal  pressure sensation in the ears, with the same nurse advice on 
pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_531121] . Pressure  then decreases very slowly during the next half hour; i n the last [ADDRESS_689649], to minim ize breaking the subjects’ blindness.  
Consideration of alternative sham  and HBOT condi tions : The two clinical trials described in the 
preliminary data section had a treatment group and a crossover group (assessed at baseline, after two months 
with no intervention, and again after HBOT intervention). A more effective design is a sham condition that is very 
similar to the HBOT condition b ut without known treatment ef fects  (and also permitting the assessment of the 
long-term effect of HBOT) . We considered a sham condition using a slightly higher 1.3 ATA level , but this 
hyperbaric condition has an increase in tissue oxygenation greater than 50%92, which may have substantial 
physiological effects , so 1.1 ATA for sham is preferable. We considered 100% oxygen with 2. 5 ATA in the HBOT 
condition, but in our experience, this protocol induced more adverse events . 
 D2g.Optimizing adherence to the int
 ervention. One challenge in a study that requires high commitment is  
achiev ing high rates of intervention adherence for the duration of the trial, especially  in the elderly  due to 
restrictive life events such as illness, caregiving responsibilities, environmental barriers, and disabilities. Nonetheless, several studies indicate that the elderly with cognitive impairment can successfully adhere to 
intensive programs and benefit from the experience, particularly when these programs provide adequate 
structure and support to the participant
93, 94. Our HBOT studies had relatively low dropout rate s of 5% (stroke 
study)  to 20% (mTBI study) . The great expertise and experience of the team, and the liberty to pass the time in  
the chamber reading, watching TV, listening to music, etc. facilitate high compliance. At screening, and again at 
randomization, Drs. Ravona and Efrati will discuss with each subject what is ex pected, and the importance of 
strong  commitment.  We will attempt to assess for outcomes subjects who withdraw from the intervention.  
 
D2h. Outcomes .  Primary cognitive outcome . The primary cognitive outcome is  a balanced composite sum of 
z-scores  of four executive function tests (Trails B, Mazes, Digit -Symbol, and Category  Fluency) , and four epi[INVESTIGATOR_531122] (immediate and delayed recall of the word list from the ADAS -Cog, and immediate and delayed

13 
 recall of Logical Memory Story I from the Wechsler Me mory Scale -III). These functions are  affected by T2D37 
and commonly administered in other MCI trials95 96, 97. Z-scores are reversed if necessary so that a positive value 
refers to good  cognition. We have published Hebrew norms  for T2D elderly subjects  for all the executive functions 
(except Mazes, which is not language dependent) , and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_531123]. [ADDRESS_689651] ing alternating numbers and letters (1, A, 2, B , etc. ); for Mazes , 
subjects draw lines from start to finish in  mazes of increas ing complexity, without back -tracking or crossing a 
boundary; for Digit -Symbol , numbers and abstract symbols are paired in a legend, and subjects fill in the symbol s 
for a series of numbers; and Category  Fluency  totals words for two categories, animals, and f or fruit and 
vegetables . ADAS word list - Subjects  read aloud [ADDRESS_689652] evidence for impairment of executive functions in T2D12, 98, another  secondary outcome will 
sum z -scores for 3 computer -based tests  (not language dependent) , developed through NIH initiatives for  new 
sensitive instruments that will ultimately be public domain (NIH Toolbox assessing multiple domains: 
http://www.nihtoolbox.org ; EXAMINER assessing executive abilities: http://examiner.ucsf.edu) . For Flan k er, 
subjects make a speeded response—whether the central arrow is pointing left or right, between flanker arrows 
pointing in the same or opposite direction; for Set -Shifting, subjects match figures by [CONTACT_531163] a cue on the screen; and for Dot -Counting, subjects count out loud the number o f targets displayed 
among distractors, and recall  the number of targets when queried, [ADDRESS_689653]- SB, which  summarizes  impairment

care)[ADDRESS_689654] preliminary data in T2D and pre -T2D showing reduced 
CBF and glucose metabolism, and supported by [CONTACT_2312]45, 49, 102, and the evidence of effects of HBOT on CBF 
and glucose metabolism (see B2), our imaging outcomes are CBF  (Arterial Spin  Labeling MRI for small vessels )  
and [F18]FDG -PET.  
D2i. Maintenance of participant blinding - Effe ctiveness of blinding will be evaluated at the end of the study in two  
ways: 1) we will ask whether participants received the “real” intervention. A post -intervention questionnaire 
(CSRQ -[ZIP_CODE]), which typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] 5-10 minutes , will explore reasons for their answer : in 64 statements on 8  
cognitive abilities , (e.g., “Did you improve, remain the same, or worsen, specifically because of being in the 
study ?”), 2) We will compare participants’ rates of voluntary withdrawal. A difference between groups ’ 
percentages over  15% will be interpreted as perception of, or lack of confidence in, the intervention.

D2j. Neuroimaging - Parti cipants will undergo a full protocol to acquire CBF  and ancillary data on a 3 Tesla (3T) 
GE x750 scanner with echo planar and asset capability using an 8- channel head radio frequency (RF) coil 
(General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). The MR I protocol will include: ASL -MRI,  T2FLAIR, and T1 -weighted imaging. 
ASL-MRI- ASL-MRI will be acqui red to assess CBF at baseline, 12 weeks (immediately after treatment)  and 12  
months after treatment . The sequence will be acquired using background -suppressed pseudo- continuous ASL 
(pcASL) , featuring a 3D fast spin echo spi[INVESTIGATOR_531124] (TR = 6000 ms; TE = 21 ms; FOV = 240 x 240 x 160 
mm; slice thickness = 4 mm no gap; matrix size=128 x 128; NEX=3; and labeling RF amplitude=0.[ADDRESS_689656] -labeling delay of  2025 ms.  3D T2FLAIR  will be acquired to assess WMH burden (TR 6000, TE 120, TI 
1870, 256 x 256 matrix, FOV 256 mm acquired over 88 2mm thick slices, no gap, with final voxel resolution 1mm 
x 1mm x 2mm; 2). 3D T1 -weighted imaging  will be acquired to use for registration, atrophy correction, and 
regional volumes (inversion- recovery prepared fast spin echo, TR 8.2, TE 4.0, TI 450, matrix 256 x 256, FOV 
256 mm, acquired over 156 1mm thick, no gap,  axial slices with isotropic 1mm voxel resolution) .  Participants 
will be asked to refrain from caffeine  and nicotine for 4 hours prior to the study.  The pcASL sequence includes 
3 averages (NEX=3). The sequence also includes a fluid- suppressed proton density (PD) acquisition, with the 
same imaging sequence/image slab location as the pcASL but without the RF labeling preparation, for CBF  
quantitation and image registration. The entire pcASL sequence—all 3 excitations plus PD scan—is acquired in

MRI Quality C ontrol:  The quality control of the scanner is done by [CONTACT_531164] . This is augmented by [CONTACT_17814] a MAGPHAN Quantitative Imaging 
phantom which has been consistently scanned at least monthly since April 2009; the scanner has been highly stable over time. Based on our experience, we anticipate technical problems <2% . There is sufficient time in the 
session for  rescanning if motion or other artifacts are observed. Trained and certified MR technologists operate 
the console ; scans are prescribed in a standardized fashion and assessed at the scanner for acceptable qualit y. 
Scans are downloaded to the imaging lab server immediately after the session and the post -processing 
procedures are implemented including an additional quality check by [CONTACT_3476]. If baseline re-imaging is 
necessary, study intervention will be delayed until satisfactory images are obtained.  
MRI Data Backup:  Multiple backups are performed to prevent technical loss of data. At the scan console, 
the exam is backed up to DVD and kept at the MR facility. The exam is  also uploaded to a PACs server  and 
permanently archived. A complete copy is downloaded to a 40TB RAID6 server and weekly backups (to a separately located server) are made of processed and incremental data.  
MRI Image P rocessing:  Images will be  pre-processed prior to statistical analysis using  well established tools 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_531125] 12 and FSL. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_531126]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_531127]: 1)

 exam into the imaging SQL database (so Drs. Beeri, Livny -Ezer, and Bendlin can view the data online via web 
tools) ; 3) coregistration of each  ASL CBF map to the baseline map which is in turn coregistered to the T1 -
weighted 3D SPGR volume at baseline; coregistration uses a mutual information algorithm and linear least 
squares minimization in SPM 12; 4) transformation into MNI canonical atlas space using the ICBM 152 template 
in SPM 12. Finally , data are smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8mm FWHM to accommodate individual 
variability and comply with assumptions of random field theory necessary for statistical analysis of the images. 
T2FLAIR images will be segmented  according to methods previously used by [CONTACT_27156]106. WMH will be used 
as covariates in the second- level analysis.    FDG -PET: [CONTACT_531192],  Chair of the Nuclear Medicine 
Department at Sheba, will oversee acquisition of [F18]FDG on a Philips Gemini GXL  + PET scanner in 3D mode.  
[F18]FDG -PET Acquisition : Participants will be studied after a minimum [ADDRESS_689659] (water allowed). Because 
participants with glucoregulatory dysfunction are being imaged, blood glucose will be closely monitored prior to 
the injection of [ F18]FDG. Blood glucose prior to [ F18]FDG administration must be ≤ 180 mg/dL for [ F18]FDG to  
be injected. Following injection with 5.0 ± 0.5 mCi of [18F][ F18]FDG participants will remain awake but relaxed 
in a quiet room. Imaging will begin  [ADDRESS_689660] injection, and the scan acquired as six 5- min. frames. A 5 -min. 
transmission scan will be  acqu ired following the emission scan. The dynamic PET data will be reconstructed 
using ECAT v7.2.2 software. A filtered back projection algorithm (DIFT) will be used with brain mode sinogram trimming, zoom = 2.8, and a 4mm Gaussian filter to a reconstructed image of 128 x 128 x 63 voxel matrix (voxel size = 1.84mm x 1.84mm x 2.43mm ). The PET data will be  corrected for the attenuation of annihilation radiation 
(using segmented attenuation maps), scanner normalization, and scatter radiation.  [F18]FDG image proces sing: 
Data will be transferred to the ADRC imaging lab at the UW -Madison using a secure protocol our  group has in 
place. The reconstructed images will be used for comparison of regional differences of [ F18]FDG uptake in the 
targeted areas of the brain. The dynamic [ F18]FDG will first be corrected for frame to frame motion using SPM 12 
software. Any frames with excessive motion will be discarded from further processing. The data will then be summed to create a single image representing [ F18]FDG uptake in the brain from the period of 45 –[ADDRESS_689661] scans . Images will 
be corrected for atrophy based on the three -compartment approach (includes GM, WM and CSF) based on the  
method published by [CONTACT_531165].
107, 108. In brief, the MR T1 image is segmented in SPM12 to provide GM, WM 
& CSF maps. The partial volume corrected gray matter tissue tracer concentration will be used for the second level group analysis, extracted from regions of interest (dorsolateral prefrontal , medial temporal, and lateral 
parietal cort ices). These regions have been selected based on their vulnerability to T2D and AD. Data will be 
extracted bilaterally using the Automated Anatomical Labeling  (AAL) atlas  implemented in WFU Pi[INVESTIGATOR_464299], and 
averaged across hemispheres prior to being entered into st atistical models. Secondary analyses will include 
exploratory whole- brain analyses conducted on a voxel -wise basis.  
D2K. Inflammatory and diabetes and dementia related m ar
 kers - Morning bloods will be obtained after a 10-
hour fast, then centrifuged. Bloods will be stored at -70C until determination in Sheba Medical center . 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689662], 2020

 We will analyze the bloods to determine the diabetes and dementia related biomarkers in several well established 
methods, like:   
High sensitivity C- reactiv e pr otein- CRP levels will be measured with a sandwich- type ELISA in which 
polyclonal rabbit anti -CRP antibodies are used as catching antibodies and a biotinylated mAb against CRP 
(CLB anti -CRP -2) is used as the detecting antibody. The inter - and intra- assay coefficients of variation are 
expected to be less than 5%.  
Interleukin -6- IL-6 will be measured using a commercial solid phase immulite (Diagnostic Products Corporation 
[DPC], Los Angeles, CA, [LOCATION_003]). Reported inter -assay coefficient of variation is 6% and intra -assay 4%, with a 
detec tion limit of 1.0 pg/ml.  
Haptoglobin- Haptoglobin will be typed (Hp 1 -1, Hp 2- 2 or Hp 2 -1) by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Andy Levy, at the Technion Israel 
Institute of Technology by [CONTACT_531166] [ADDRESS_689663]. Levy’s lab processes about [ADDRESS_689664] signature [CONTACT_531184] [CONTACT_531167] 1 or Hp 2  alleles (Hp 1- 1 or Hp 2- 2 
respectively), or who are heterozygous (Hp 2 -1). Polyacrylamide electrophoresis is the most common method 
for typi[INVESTIGATOR_531128] 100% concordance with genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Diabetes  related markers e.g. Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) (Hemoglobin A1c, LDL etc.)  
Dementia related markers e.g. Plasma Amyloid Beta and Tau- Amyloid Beta and Tau proteins will be analyzed 
via Immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_332]– mass spectrometry (IP –MS) assay . If in the future new dementia and diabetes related 
biomarkers will be discovered, we request the IRB’s approval to analyze tho se markers as well.  
 
 
D2I. Performing the study at the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_531129]  - [CONTACT_531193], the Asaf Harofeh site PI , is the 
chairman of the Israeli Society for Hyperbaric & Diving Medicine and an internationally renowned leader in HBOT. 
The Asaf Harofeh Hyperbaric Unit is one of the largest , most active worldwide with about 100 patients treated 
per day, in a variety of FDA approved indications (e.g. non -healing ischemic wounds, post radiation injury , 
chronic osteomy elitis). There is widespread accessibility of HBOT chambers in the US (please see letter of 
support from [CONTACT_455873], the American Undersea &  Hyperbaric Medical Society Executive Director describing 
~1400 US HBOT chambers, with an estimated annual growth of 8 -10%).  This suggests that finding collaborative 
HBOT facilities in the US would not be a problem in a large- scale multi -center RCT for cognitively impaired T2D 
patients  based on this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  Importantly, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_531130], making the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_531131]. The Sheba Medica l Center is the largest hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531132] , and is home for the NIH funded IDCD study , so it has 
all the necessary infrastructure, personnel, experience, and expertise in recruitment of elderly subjects with T2D, 
and of assessment of the cognitive and biological outcome measures of the proposed study. It is only [ADDRESS_689665], 
by [CONTACT_112863] T2D -related characteristics, such as severity of disease, which  may identify groups of subjects with 
more  benefit from HBOT. Finally, generalizability of results to Americans is crucial. Americans and Israelis are 
similar in prevalence of several cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, specifically T2D. The prevalence of 
T2D in both the US and in Israel is about 25 % for individuals above the age of [ZIP_CODE], 110, and the mortality rate 
associated with diabetes is essentially identical in both countries, slightly below 40 per 100,000111, 112. The 
distribution of type of medication used (none, oral, or insulin) is also very similar in the US110 and Israel80. 
 
D2J. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_531133] - Poten tially larger sham dropout rates - The sham  group will feel less ear pressure  
than the HBOT group. Since the intervention is time consuming, there may be more dropout s among  those who 
think  they are in the control  group. In the majority of  RCTs  of behavioral interventions, there are no differences 
in the dropout rates of control groupse.g.113 -117. All subjects will be told that they will be randomized to high or low 
hyperbaric pressure, and that it is un know n yet if either  works . At the end of the participant's 12 months 
participation in the trial, the participant can choose to receive HBOT treatment for which the costs will be covered by [CONTACT_3476].  At the end of the second HBOT treatment course, an additional neuropsychologic al 
assessment will be administered to participants. The nurse might  perceive the difference between HBOT and 
sham but will be instructed not to discuss this with participants . No non -T2D control arms - inclusion of non- T2D 
parallel HBOT and sham arms would show whether efficacy is specific  to T2D, or generalizes to all MCI patients. 
However, for  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_531134], the aim is proof of  concept that HBOT improves cognition, focusing 
on T2D-MCI patients,  who are enric hed in cerebrovascular disease—the main target of HBOT —and at high risk 
for decline, improving  statistical power . With ½ of the US elderly  suffering from T2D or pre- T2D, th is study  has 
potential for  broad public health impact . Collecting AD neuropathology data- Despi[INVESTIGATOR_531135]118-[ADDRESS_689666] measuring them in CSF, due to a focus on 
vascular mechanisms, incomplete scientific evidence supporting AD neuropathology as an HBOT mechanistic 
target in a T2D context, and minimizing participants ’ burden.   
 
D3. Logisti
cs and communication among the international investigators- [CONTACT_531194] ri has collaborated for 
many years with all investigators and has numerous joint publications demonstrating her capability to effectively 
lead international studies with complex logistics. Drs. Beeri and Sano will lead 2 biweekly conference calls. One, 
with the Sheba and the Asaf Harofeh teams, will discuss day -to-day aspects of the trial (recruitment, refusals 
and ways to overcome them, data entry and missing data, staffing and coordination, and adverse events). The other, with the senior investigators, Dr s. Bendlin, Ravona, Efrati, Ashery, and Leroith, will monitor overall 
progress toward the trial’s goals. Both meetings will have minutes that will be sent to the meeting participants 
and action items will be reviewed in each meeting. Drs. Bendlin and Livni communicate very often on the 
neuroimaging aspects of other collaborative studies facilitating continuous communication on the proposed 
study. Images upload to the warehouse is done at the scan day and [CONTACT_531185] has access to them (see D5). 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689667] three months will be devoted to obtaining IRB approvals  from all sites and training 
study physicians, neuropsychologists, and nurses for data collection. Screening and enrollment  will occur from 
month 4 of the study and until the middle of year 4 ( ~47 subjects/year) ; data collection and cleaning  will extend 
for another year.  Analyses  and preparation of the primary manuscript  will be in the final [ADDRESS_689668] 
warehoused data. Data  transmission has been successful in the IDCD and our other international projects.  
 
D6. Statistical Analysis Plan - Effic acy analyses will be performed for the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, our 
primary analysis , and for fully and partially compliant per -protocol (PP) populations. The ITT population will 
include all participants in the group to which they were randomized, regardless of any protocol deviation including 
non-compliance, adverse events, or loss of follow -up. The PP populations will include participants in the group 
according to the intervention actually received, but a separate analysis will be performed for those who were fully compliant (at least 80% of sessions  completed ) and for those who were partially compliant (at least one session  
completed ). A complier -average causal effect (CACE) analysis using a latent class modeling approach will also 
be performed on both fully and partially compl iant populations. Patients missing a baseline value of a continuous 
efficacy outcome measure will be excluded from all analyses and maximum likelihood estimation methods will be used to handle missing data arising from an unobserved follow -up visit
122.  
Aims 1a and 1b:  The pri m ary (overall cognition) and secondary  (executive functions , epi[INVESTIGATOR_531136], and computer -based tests ) cognitive o utcome measures  (all summaries of z -scores) , will each be 
analyzed using a mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with time of assessment (baseline or 12 weeks) 
as the within- subjects factor, treatment group (HBOT vs. sham) as the between- subjects factor and baseline 
value of the outcome measure as the covariate. Both, subject and ‘ cluster ’ (the variable used to identify to which 
group o f at least 3  subjects each individual is assigned) will be modeled as random effects  to account for the 
correlation among repeated m easure ments  made over time within a subject as well as potential ‘cluster  effects’ 
arising from blocks of  at least [ADDRESS_689669] ed percentiles of the baseline distribution. Secondary 
mixed model ANCOVA analyses will be performed for cognitive assessments at 6 and 12 months following 
treatment. As an exploratory analysis, linear mixed effects models will assess the relationship between treatment 
group (fixed effect) and the longitudinal trend (random intercept and slope for each subject) in the primary and 
secondary cognitive outcome measures, assessed at 12 -weeks, 6 months and 12 months following treatment . 
The primary hypothesis will be tested by [CONTACT_531168] -up assessment, with a significant interaction indicating a difference in longitudinal cognitive trends 
between treatment groups.  Potential confounders (age, gender, education, duration of T2D,  HbA1c, diabetes 
medications [insulin vs. no medications and oral agents vs. no medication], levels of atrophy and white matter hyperintensities ) will be included as covariates if there is imbalance at baseline (p<0.1) or association between 
the covariate and the response (p<0.15).  
To explore whether specific dichotomized T2D characteristics (such as the last HbA1c level 
(dichotomi
zed at 7) in the Diabetes Registry, the number of T2D complications, and the number of severe 
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_531137]) are associated with greater improvements following 
treatment with HBOT, mixed effects ANCOVA models similar to those for Aims [ADDRESS_689670] prevalently used medications with cognitive  outcomes. When potential confounders are associated with cognitive outcomes, this also may identif y 
subgroups for which HBOT is particularly effective.  
  
Aims 2a and 2b:  CBF and cereb r
 al glucose utilization will be analyzed with a similar strategy to Aim s 1a 
and 1b  except that there will be no 6 month assessment. Mixed effects ANCOVA models will be use d to compare 
changes in these outcome measures from baseline to 12 weeks following treatment , and, as exploratory 
analyses , linear mixed effects models will be used to assess relationships between treatment group (fixed effect) 
and the longitudinal trend (random intercept and slope for each subject) in MRI -ASL and FDG -PET outcome 
measures, assessed at 12- weeks and 12 months following treatment. Vascular effects of HBOT vs. S ham: Since  
CBF derived from ASL perfusion may represent combined effects of neural metabolism and vascular effects,  a 
secondary mixed effects ANCOVA model (similar to Aim 2b)  of vascular  changes from baseline to [ADDRESS_689671] for  neural metabolism derived from FDG -PET.  
Aim 3 : Outcome m eas ures (changes in CBF  and cerebral glucose utilization) identified as having 
significant associations with treatment group in Aims 2a and 2b will be further explored as mediators of the relationship between treatment group and the change in cognition.  To ensure that measurement of mediator 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689672] (i.e. the effect of treatment group on the change in cognition from baseline to 12 months via a mediator
 among other mediators in the model) and the total indirect 
effect (i.e. the sum of specific indirect effects for all mediators in the model). The bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_19188]93 will be 
used in each multiple mediator model to compute bias -corrected standard errors (and 95% confidence intervals) 
for the specific and total indirect effect point estimates.  
  
D7. Power Analysis and sample size justification  
Aim 1.  Power is presented for detecting the difference in mean 
change (from baseline to 12 weeks) in overall cogniti on z-
scores between the sham and HBOT treatment groups. Power 
calculations are based on two- sample t -tests and are 
conducted with a 2- sided 5% significance  level (Table 3) . A 2-
sample t -test provides a more conservative power estimate 
than the proposed mixed model approach , which  is expected 
to explain more variability and thus  have more power to detect 
the same effect size with the same sample size.  
The predicted mean change in the sham group  from 
baseline to 12 weeks is - 0.02 (based on the IDCD 12- week 
change in overall cognition) . Assuming an SD of 0.[ADDRESS_689673] 80% power to detect an improvement in the HBOT group of 0. 224, 
a “medium” effect size of 0.49.  To account for an anticipated dropout rate of 13%  (a reasonable estimate 
compared to the 5% dropout rate in our stroke study ), we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_689674] size of 0.49 is feasible.   
Aim 2:  As for Aim 1, power is presented for detecting the difference in the mean changes in CBF  velocity

 D8. Future directions: If this pi[INVESTIGATOR_531138] , we will pursue a multi- center large- scale clinical trial to 
provide definitive  evidence for the benefits of HBOT  to cognition in T2D patients at high risk for dementia, taking 
advantage of the new knowledge acquired in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_531139], design, recruitment 
strategies, attrition, cognitive outcomes, biomarkers,  and subgroups benefitting most. Si nce HBOT is widely 
available and well tolerated, the proposed trial’s success may suggest testing HBOT efficacy in non- T2D elderly 
with MCI as well.  
 
 E.  HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH  
1. Risks to the Subjects - Human Subject Involvement and Characteristics.  
 a. Involvement and Characteristics: 
Involvement .  The T2D subjects involved in this RCT will participate in neuropsychological assessments involving 
a clinical/diagnostic interview and paper and pencil tests.  In addition, they will be  interviewed in a ris k factor 
inventory in which basic demographic, some medical information, and past behaviors (e.g. smoking, physical 
activity) will be  assessed. In addition, subjects will go through an MRI examination and a PET scan. Subjects 
will be also asked about their  activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Only subjects who 
have a diagnosis of T2D and a diagnosis of MCI will participate in the study. Subjects will be randomized to 
HBOT or sham. Both groups will be treated in the oxygen chamber for 60 sessions, 5 times/week, 90 minutes each session and will receive 100% oxygen. The HBOT group will have 2.[ADDRESS_689677] five minutes of the 90 -minute sessions. All other 
conditions and assessments will be identical for the two groups. All assessments will be performed at baseline (before treatment), at 12 weeks (immediately after treatment) and at 12 months (to assess maintenance of HBOT 
effects in the long term).  At 6 months, only the cognitive assessments will be assessed. Upon informed consent, 
subjects ’ long term diabetes characteristics (such as HbA1C, duration of disease, anti -diabetic medication status, 
and hypertension status) will be  given by [CONTACT_531169] .  
Characteristics .  Eligibility c r
 iteria are summarized in Table 1, section D2a of the application. This study will 
consist of 154 elderly subjects (>65 years of age) who have T2D  and a diagnosis of MCI (both amnestic and 
non-amnestic) . Subjects must have at least one informant and must speak fluent Hebrew for the 
neuropsychological assessment. Subjects may not have a brain disease t hat might affect cognition such as 
schizophrenia or Parkinson’s disease, they may not have epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], inner ear disease, or claustrophobia. Subjects cannot be receiving cholinesterase inhibitors and cannot have an indication for HBOT, such as diabetic foot,  
since then they cannot be randomized to the sham group. There are no inclusion or exclusion criteria on the 
basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other minority affiliations. Within the elderly, Israel is primarily a 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689678] pr ior to the procedure to ensure that subjects are free of such materials. In 
addition to the MRI technicians, a member of the study team will accompany subjects to reassure participants and aid in relaxing them. When subjects finish all MRI procedures, they  will lie down for a few minutes; they will 
be seated for another few minutes, until they feel comfortable and secure to stand up and leave. The FDG -PET 
exam will take about 50 minutes and will be performed on a separate day from the MRI so not to over -burden 
the subjects. The HBOT protocol will include 60 sessions, five times/week, for 90 minutes each session, at 2.0 ATA and 100% oxygen. The sham group will receive exactly the same protocol but with 1.1ATA at the first five and last five minutes of the 90 -minute sessions. Description of the HBOT, MRI, and FDG -PET risks and the 
measures the study team will take to minimize them are described in the “Adequacy of Protection Against Risks” below.  
  
2. Adequacy of  P
rotection Against Risks  
a. Recruitment and Info rmed Cons en t.  Recruitment will be done through talks in the community, 
advertisements, and companies which have large lists of elderly interested in receiving emails about health 
related topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. All IDCD subjects have signed through the IDCD informed consent that they agree to be 
approached for other research projects.  Subjects will have MCI but frank dementia is an exclusion criteria so 
they will have capacity to understand the informed consent (even mild to moderate cases with frank dementia typi[INVESTIGATOR_531140]). [CONTACT_531189]- Springer, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_531141], is a senior geriatric 
psychiatrist and will perform the diagnostic process to confirm MCI. Cognitive assessments, MRI, and PET scans will be performed in Sheba. The HBOT and sham interventions will be performed at the oxygen multiplace chamber at Asaf Harofeh.  
Consent  will be obtained from the patient. The IR B-appr
 oved consent document will explain the purpose 
of the study, procedures to be followed, potential risks and benefits to be expected, costs, treatment alternatives, 
confidentiality statement, an offer to answer questions, a statement regarding the right to refuse to participate or 
withdraw, and a statement on rights and obligations if injury occurs during the course of  the trial. 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689679] time. Signed and witnessed consents 
are kept in a locked file, in a locked room, with other patient data.  
MRI:  For the MRI component of the renewal, subjects will be asked to come to the Sheba Medical Center 
Department of Radiology where the MRI machines are located.  Subjects will respond to a detailed questionnaire 
regarding the presence of body metals and only then entered into the magnet. It will be explained to subjects 
that lying down in the MRI may provoke claustrophobia and discomfort, because their head will be in a relatively narrow tube and the MRI makes loud sounds. Subjects will be told that the whole MRI session will take approximately 60 minutes; afterwards they will rest for a few minutes and sit for a few more minutes, and can 
leave when they feel comfo rtable.  
FDG -PET- PET i m
 aging involves exposure to small amounts of ionizing radiation, which has no expected harmful 
effects. No adverse effects from radiopharmaceuticals used in this study have been reported. However, the possibility exists for a rare reaction to any of the substances or procedures to which the subject is exposed and for that reason a physician will be present at all times in the PET -CT area when participants are in the scanner. 
The radiation dose received by [CONTACT_531170] [F -18]FDG scan will be below the limits established in 
21CFR §361.1 for whole body (50 mSv), active blood forming organs, lens of eye and gonads (5 rad) and target organ (15 rad). The effective human radiation dose for a subject undergoing FDG -PET will be less than [ADDRESS_689680] 
of hyperbaric oxygen, with an incidence of less than 2%89. Middle ear effusions (which may be hemorrhagic) and 
tympanic membrane rupture occur in less than 1% of patients. Middle ear symptoms may be alleviated by [CONTACT_531171]. Sinus 
barotrauma (sinus squeeze) is the second most common complication of hyperbaric oxygen and is usually seen in patients with upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]. Subjects with such conditions will not be allowed to continue the intervention until symptoms are over . Seizures due to central nervous system oxygen toxicity are a rare but 
a possible dramatic consequence of HBO T; estimates of incidence range from [ADDRESS_689681], 2020 
24 
 nervous system oxygen toxicity. HBO T has been associated with hypoglycemia in some patients with diabetes, 
and hypoglycemia should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of HBO T-associated seizures92. 
Seizures due to oxygen toxicity do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_531142]89. In the unlikely 
case of a seizure in this trial, it will be managed acutely by [CONTACT_531172][INVESTIGATOR_531143] (FIO2 = 0.21), administering anticonvulsant therapy, and terminating hyperbaric treatment. Importantly, a 
nurse from the Hyperbaric Unit team will be at all times with the subjects inside the chamber, and a physician 
will be at all times in the Unit providing immediate medical response if any of the adverse events arises. All other 
potential adverse effects (reversible myopia, pulmonary oxygen toxicity) are very rare and reversible.  
 b. Protec tion Against Risk.  The overall risks of this proposal are small. Potential risks will be minimized 
by [CONTACT_531173], including laboratory tests, to ensure health status, warning subjects and their caregivers of  potential 
study risks, inquiring about potential adverse reactions at regular intervals and performing screening laboratory  
tests at regular intervals to help ensure continuing good health. Professional treatment will not be altered or modified for research purposes. Subjects are informed that they may terminate testing at any time should they find any aspect objectionable. The interviewers and research assistants will be clinically trained and sensitive to 
signs of stress, anxiety and/or fatigue. In the event that study participation results in injury or  illness requiring 
emergency medical treatment, appropriate acute medical care will be provided at no cost to the subject. A  Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board will be established to monitor adverse events and other safety concerns.  
Protection of patient confidentiality  and privacy  
 will be rigorously guarded through several measures: 1) by [CONTACT_531174] ; 2) storage of written information in locked 
filing cabinets at all times ; 3) storage of electronic information in databases accessible only through a password  
that is not available to anyone outside of the study staff ; and 4) no use of names or other identifying information 
in publications or other publicly available documents.  However, subjects will be told that should confidential  
information be accidentally disclosed to the wrong party, it could have adverse consequences for the subject in terms of liability in legal proceedings, or discrimination in obtaining life or private health insurance.  Again, we 
note that Israelis have the right for complete health coverage.  
 
3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others  
 Risks of this project to the subjects are judged to be small, the discomfort of having an MRI and a PET-
scan , and the potential ear pressure during the HBOT sessions . Potential benefits include improved symptoms 
of cognitive function or slower rate of progression of dementia symptoms.  Improved symptoms would be 
expected to improve patient quality of life. These potential benefits exceed the potential harm  by [CONTACT_531175].  Additional possible direct benefits are those that might arise from a comprehensive cognitive and 
neuroimaging examination. Such assessments may provide clinically relevant information and lead to referrals 
for otherwise unrecognized cognitive or brain abnormalities that may require treatment. For this reason, the relatively small risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to subjects and others.  
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689682] (DS MB) will consist of four members, with expertise in the four areas 
relevant to this RCT: type [ADDRESS_689683] of the study. 
These may include amending safety -monitoring procedures, modifying the protocol or consent,  terminating the 
study or continuing the study as designed. The discussions and decisions of the DSMB will be summarized in 
written reports and provided to the PI s. All DSMB reports will be shared with the Mount Sinai IRB , which is the 
supervisory IRB for this study and which will transfer these reports to the other 2 IRBs involved (Asaf Harfeh, 
Sheba) and will become part of the study regulatory binder. The DSMB will meet in person or by [CONTACT_531176] a quarterly basis.  The DSMB will also provide advice regarding any discrepancies found by [CONTACT_531177].  
 6. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 a. Data Q u
 ality The quality of the data will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] s. The following elements will be 
monitored: recruitment proceeding as  expected; subjects fully  match the inclusion/exclusion criteria; deviations 
Version  9.[ADDRESS_689684], 2020 
26 
 from the protocol; timeliness, accuracy, and confidentiality of all information both in study documents and 
database.   
 We are cognizant that overseeing a project that takes place in a geographically distant place and in 
another country poses challenges with respect to data quality and protocol adherence. The successful 
implementation of the IDCD study clearly demonstrates the feasibility of this international collaboration. In addition,  we will conduct bi -weekly conference calls, one with the data collection team, and one with the senior 
investigators .  Prior to each meeting, [CONTACT_531186] sends an email compi[INVESTIGATOR_531144]. 
The investigators of the study have maintained, literally, email and phone c[INVESTIGATOR_2394]tact [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a daily basis. Drs. Beeri and Sano work closely for over a decade.  [CONTACT_531186] has international collaborations with all other study 
investigators involving other projects in Israel (IDCD study, IRAP study)  and travels every other month to Israel, 
for face to face meetings and review  of data and procedures on site. The PIs of the Asaf Harofeh ([CONTACT_531188]) and 
Sheba ([CONTACT_531189]) sites are both physician scientists. Thus, the investigators  have all the necessary expertise 
relevant for this RCT, have continuous  contact , and are well integrated around this (and other) joint dementia -
related projects.  
 b. Safet
 y Monitoring   Safety monitoring for adverse events (AEs) will be conducted in real time by [CONTACT_531178]. Beeri  and Sano together with Drs. Efrati and Ravona, both of whom are MDs, the Project Director, Research 
Coordinators, and the IRBs at Mount Sinai, Asaf Harofeh and Sheba and reported to the Data Safety and 
Monitoring Board. They will determine the severity of  the event, will assign attribution to the event, and will 
monitor the event until its resolution.  All adverse events will be indicated on the source documentation for the 
study, and on the specific adverse event report form. The following information about adverse events will be collected: 1) the onset and resolution of the AE, 2) an assessment of the severity or intensity (use existing grading scales whenever possible), 3) an assessment of the relationship of the event to the study (definitely, probably, possibly or not related), and 4) action taken (e.g., none, referral to MD, start or adjust concomitant medication).  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the three  sites’ IRBs within [ADDRESS_689685] will later 
be followed by a written report to the IRB (using their SAE reporting form).  All serious adverse events (SAEs) 
will be reported to the DSMB within [ADDRESS_689686] WJ, Shaw LM, Toga AW,

 BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
 Background  
In December 2019 the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus ribonucleic acid (RNA) was quickly identified in some of these participants. Per the World Health Organization (WHO ), on January 5, [ADDRESS_1021891] over 75 mi llion confirmed cases globally with over 1.68 
million confirmed deaths (Source: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel -coronavirus-
2019). The WHO named the disease caused by [CONTACT_746984] -19, and the virus 
causing the disease SARS -CoV2 to reflect its similarity to the genetic se quence of SARS -CoV, 
the virus that had previously caused Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (SARS) that was discovered in 2002. 
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID -[ADDRESS_1021892] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  [ADDRESS_1021893] of Scientific Advisors, NCI Director Ned 
Sharpless was speaking about the pandemic, an excerpt from the discussion was provided by T he 
Cancer L etter below (source: https://c ancerletter.com/articles/20200515_3/ ): 
“I’m becoming worried that, because of the pandemic, that in [ADDRESS_1021894] Annual Report to the Nation since 1993 that shows an increase in cancer mortality,” 
Sharpless said. “And I know exactly what the statistics will mean for participants. I know that that 
represents more cancer suffering and more bad outcomes, and more deaths.”  
In short, the COVID -[ADDRESS_1021895] the core 
mission of the NCI for years to come.  Therefore, there is an urgent public health need for rapid development and deployment of novel interventions . 
 Vaccine Development  
ModernaTX, Inc. has developed a rapid response, proprietary messenger RNA (mRNA) -based 
vaccine platform. This is based on the principle and observations that antigens can be produced in vivo by [CONTACT_132589], uptake and expression of the corresponding mRNA by [INVESTIGATOR_100372]. ModernaTX, Inc. is 
using its mRNA -based technology to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) -encapsulated 
mRNA- based vaccine against SARS -CoV- 2 (mRNA- 1273). Prior preclinical studies  have 
demonstrated that coronavirus spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) proteins are immunog enic and S protein- based vaccines, 
including deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and mRNA delivery platforms, are protective in animals. Prior clinical trials of vaccines targeting related coronaviruses and other viruses have demonstrated that DNA and mRNA- based vaccines are safe and immunogenic. It is therefore anticipated that 
mRNA-[ADDRESS_1021896] immune responses to the SARS- CoV -2 S protein [ 1]. 
This mRNA- based vaccine does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and expression is transient. Therefore, mRNA vaccines thereby [CONTACT_394409] a mechanism to stimulate endogenous production of structurally intact protein antigens in a way that mimics wild-type viral infection and are a ble to induce good immune responses against infectious 
pathogens such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and influenza virus ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The agent mRNA -1273 is a novel LNP mRNA -based vaccine that encodes for 
the full -length spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein of SARS -CoV- 2, modified to introduce two proline residues to 
stabilize the S protein into a pre -fusogenic form.  
The coronavirus spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] S protein mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells, making it a primary target for neutralizing antibodies that prevent infection [ 2-10] . T
he NIH Vaccine 
Research Center (VRC) and collaborators have identified 2 proline mutations at the apex of the S2 central helix that stabilize the S protein in its prefusion conformation (S -2P) [11]. T
hese mutations 
have been applied to [ADDRESS_1021897] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  [ADDRESS_1021898] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_23223] (MERS), SARS, and WIV1, are potent immunogens in mice. In collaboration with ModernaTX, Inc, mRNA expressing the MERS S-2P protein sequence was produced and compared to mRNA expressing wild -type S protein. mRNA 
expressing the MERS S -2P protein was more immunogenic than mRNA expressing wild- type S 
protein, and mice immunized with a dose as low as 0.016 mcg of MERS S -2P mRNA had 
neutralizing activity above the threshold of protection in dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) mice and protected mice from MERS challenge. Based on the robust immunogenicity of the MERS S -2P 
mRNA vaccine in mice, the VRC and ModernaTX, Inc. designed mRNA expressing a membrane -
anchored SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_1021899] candidate DNA vaccine expressing SARS S protein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults age 21 to 49 years in 2004 and 2005 following a rapid vaccine development response to the SARS outbreak [12] .

The expressed prefusion, stabilized S protein binds to the its proposed receptor, human ACE -2,

Preliminary clinical data from the mRNA -1273 phase I study indicates that all 45 participants 
tested at doses 25, 100 and 250 mcg demonstrated antibodies after one dose. After the second vaccination, serum -neutralizing activity was detected by [CONTACT_746987], 
with values generally similar to those in the upper half of the distribution of a panel of control convalescent serum specimens [15].

CONFIDENTIAL   Next, investigators evaluated the balance of Th1 and Th2, because vaccine -associated enhanced 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765] (VAERD) has been associated with Th2 -biased immune responses in children 
immunized with whole -inactivated virus vaccines against RSV and measles virus [ 16].  A similar 
phenomenon has also been reported in some animal models with whole -inactivated SARS -CoV 
vaccines. Thus, the resea rchers first compared levels of S -specific IgG2a/c and IgG1, which are 
surrogates of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively, elicited by [CONTACT_46317] -[ADDRESS_1021914] Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS). 
Both immunogens elicited IgG2a and IgG1 subclass S -binding antibodies, indicating a balanced 
Th1/Th2 response  (Figure  6a-c) . [ADDRESS_1021915], the investigators also directly measured 
cytokine patterns in vaccine -induced memory T cells by [CONTACT_15242] (ICS); 
mRNA-1273- elicited CD4+ T cells re- stimulated with S1 or S2 peptide pools exhibited a Th1-
dominant response, particularly at higher immunogen doses  (Figure  6d-e). F urthermore, [ADDRESS_1021916] CD8+ T cell response to the S1 peptide pool  (Figure  6f-g) . T he Ig 
subclass and T cell cytokine data together demonstrate that immunization with mRNA -1273 elicits 
a balanced Th1/Th2 response in contrast to the Th2- biased response seen with S protein adjuvanted 
with alum, suggesting that mRNA vaccination avoids Th2- biased immune responses that have 
been linked to VAERD.

Protective immunity was assessed in young adult BALB/cJ mice challenged with mouse- adapted

BALB/cJ mice that received two 1 μg doses of mRNA -1273 were completely protected from viral 
replication in lungs after challenge at a 5- (Figure  7a ) . mRNA-1273- induced immunity also 
rendered viral replication in nasal turbinates undetectable in 6 out of 7 mice  (Figure  7b). Efficacy 
of mRNA- 1273 was dose -dependent, with two 0.1 μg mRNA -1273 doses reducing lung viral load 
by ~100- fold and two 0.01 μg mRNA -1273 doses reducing lung viral load by ~3- fold (Figure  7a). 
Of note, mice challenged [ADDRESS_1021920] lung viral replication  (Figure  7c). Challenging animals immunized 
with sub- protective doses provides an orthogonal assessment of safety signals, such as increased 
clinical illness or pathology. Similar to what was observed with MERS -CoV S -2P mRNA, mice 
immunized with sub -protective 0.1 and 0.01 μg mRNA -1273 doses showed no evidence of 
enhanced lung pathology or excessive mucus production (Figure  7d). In summary, mRNA -[ADDRESS_1021921] 2023

 Scientific Rationale 
2.4.[ADDRESS_1021926] immunity is achieved in their respective communities.   
If, however, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_746938], cancer participants are deemed to be immune -competent 
and able to form neutralization of the receptor binding domain of the S protein of SARS -CoV2, 
then this vulnerable population should be prioritized to urgently receive effective vaccines in order 
to minimize suffering and death from COVID -19.  As the modern era of cancer therapeutics has 
never co -existed with a major global pandemic, the urgency of the response of the cancer patient 
to vaccination is a significa nt question of public health importance to our community of 
participants, providers, academics, and our colleagues in industry. 
2.4.2 Study Population  
Cancer participants are presumed to be at increased risk from COVID -19 infection fatality due to 
underlying malignancy, treatment -related immunosuppression, or increased number of 
comorbidities. In a recent report by [CONTACT_746992] Y et al, participants with cancer (n=18) had higher risk of 
severe events (invasive ventilation or death) compared with non -cancer participants (n=1572) with 
COVID- 19: 39% versus 8% [19] T
he majority of these 18 cancer participants were in “remission” 
or in long- term follow -up. Among the [ADDRESS_1021927] 
month, three had a severe event.  
In a recently published study from a [LOCATION_001] Health system a total of 218 participants with 
ma
lignancies with COVID -19 were identified [ 20].  Case fatality rates were 2 -3 times the age -
specific percentages seen in non -cancer population in the same academic center and in the greater 
[LOCATION_001] City area for all COVID- 19 participants. A total of 61 (28%) cancer participants die d 
from COVID -19 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37% (20/54) for hematologic malignancies and 
25% (41/164) for solid malignancies. Myeloid malignancies such as Myelodysplastic syndromes  
(MDS ), Acute myeloid leukemia  (AML ) and Myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN) showed a trend 
for higher mortality compared to lymphoid neoplasms Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ), Chronic 
lymphocytic l eukemia ( CLL ), Acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ), Multiple Myeloma ( MM) and 
Hodgkin Lymphoma ( HL). Rates of ICU admission and ventilator use were slightly higher for

CONFIDENTIAL   hematologic malignancies than solid tumors (26% vs 19% and 11% vs 10%, respectively), but this 
did not achieve statistical significance. The authors noted that participants with hematologic malignancies tend to be treated with more myelosuppressive therapy and are often severely 
immunocompromised due to underlying disease.  
2.4.3 Rationale for Booster Doses of Vaccine  
Decreased immune responses in patients with malignancies create a need to identify improved 
vaccination strategies for this vulnerable population. One approach involves repeat ‘booster’ vaccinations . Previous studies investigating booster vaccinations with the influenza vaccine have 
produced disappointing results in CLL and after allogeneic stem cell transplant [21, 22]. Ho
wever, 
booster vaccinations appear to be effective in certain immunocompromised populations, including 
after solid organ transplant or in plasma cell dyscrasias  [23, 24].  Importantly, it is unknown 
whether booster vaccinations with novel adjuvanted vaccines will be  able to increase 
immunogenicity in patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly in patients receiving cancer directed oral targeted therapy or CAR T cell therapy. In order to determine whether booster vaccinations can improve seroconversion rates, booster vaccinations will be offered to subjects 
who have completed  a standard vaccine series. For the purpose of this study, patients will receive 
booster doses of mRNA- 1273 regardless of their serologic status.   
All patients who receive booster vaccinations may benefit from enhanced and prolonged immu
nogenicity, which will be measured for all cohorts enrolled.  
2.4.4 Rationale for Booster Doses for Patients on CAR T Cell Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53301] B Cell 
Malignancies 
The development of CARTx for B cell malignancies is a major milestone in cancer treatment. However, CARTx recipi[INVESTIGATOR_746939] -tumor 
treatments and the immune -related adverse event (irAE) of prolonged B  cell depletion from on -
target/off- tumor side effects.  
The goals of the currently funded U01 grant within the Cancer Moonshot PI -DDN (U01 
CA247548- 01) are to define the humoral irAEs related to B cell depletion by [CONTACT_746993]19 - and BCMA- targeted CARTx on pre -existing and de novo pathogen- specif ic immunity. 
We will determine the proportion of adults with seroprotection to vaccine -preventable and other 
infections, and how these findings change over time, in a prospective cohort study. In addition, we will perform an observational study of patients  who are receiving routine vaccinations after 
CARTx to define the frequency and correlates of vaccine responses.  
SARS -CoV- [ADDRESS_1021929] patients with SARS -CoV- 2 infection reported to 
the CIBMTR demonstrated an ~30% probability of death within [ADDRESS_1021930] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Similar rates are described after CARTx, many of whom do not generate humoral immune responses. 
There are no data pertaining to the immunogenicity of SARS -CoV- 2 vaccines in CARTx 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Given B -cell deficits after CARTx, rates of seroconversion after SARS -CoV- 2 
vaccination are anticipated to occur in 40- 60% based on the range of routine vaccination response 
rates in similar contexts, preliminary data generated by [CONTACT_746994], and

additional or higher doses) have been employed to increase other vaccine responses in 
immunocompromised patients and is standard of care for hepatitis A and B, for example.  
2.4.5 R ationale for Interruption of BTK Inhibitor Therapy at time of Booster 
Vaccination (Applicable only to CLL patients on BTK Inhibitor Therapy) 
A prior study performed by [CONTACT_746995] S ection investigated the 
recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine (HEPLISAV -B) in patients with CLL that were treatment naïve 
or receiving continuous Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) treatment [ 27]. A n analysis of 58 
patients revealed that only 1 of 26 (3.8%) patients on continuous BTKi achieved a serologic response (anti -HBs titers >10 mIU/ml), compared to 9 of 32 (28.1%) treatment naïve CLL patients 
achieving a response. Similar findings were conf irmed in a more recent study investigating the 
[COMPANY_007] -BionTech COVID- 19 vaccine in patients with CLL; only 16% (n=8 of 50) of patients 
receiving a BTKi developed a serologic response, compared to 55% (n=23 of 58) of treatment naïve CLL patients [ 28]. 
We therefore conclude, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_746940], that a 
de novo humoral immune response is severely impaired with continuous BTKi therapy. Given the clinical benefit of long -term continuous therapy with BTKi,  [29] an
d the widespread use of this 
class of drugs, this study aims to test whether vaccination during a drug holiday could improve serologic responses. Specifically, in one of the CLL treatment arms, we plan to hold BTKi therapy up to 3 weeks at a time (see Section 4.6).   
T 
he duration of drug holding is based on our previous data on the rate of recovery of BTK function 
after drug withdrawal [ 30] U p to ~10- 15% of BTK is replaced by [CONTACT_746996]; thus after 7 days of drug holding, we estimate that signaling pathways will 
reactivate. After vaccination or infection, antibody titers become detectable within approximately 10 days  [31, 32] A
ccounting for a possible delayed immune response in patients with hematologic 
malignancies,  we expected that holding BTKi treatment for approximately  2 weeks after 
vaccination is sufficient for an immune response.  
We consider that drug holding has no adverse effects on patient outcome. In clinical practice, dose in
terruptions are commonly performed. In particular, holding BTKi treatment for 3 -7 days prior to 
and after invasive procedures is recommended by [CONTACT_746997]. While one retrospective analysis reported that ibrutinib dose reductions or interruptions were associated with inferior progression free survival (PFS), these dose interruptions were  made in patients who had only recently started ibrutinib (median treatment 
duration 9 months). Furthermore, some of the progression events were transient in nature, as evidenced by a significant number of patients (n=11; 42%) achieving favorable responses  upon 
resumption of therapy  [33] In
 our series of patients treated at the NIH, medically indicated dose 
interruptions of BTKi treatment did not negatively impact long -term outcomes  [34] In  order to 
minimize risk for patients and ensure their disease is well controlled, we plan to allow interruption of BTKi treatment around the time of vaccination only in patients that are clinically stable and have received BTKi therapy for at least 6 months prior to vaccination.  
Achieving vaccine responses in CLL patients is clinically beneficial as this is a high -r
 isk group for 
infection related morbidity and mortality. COVID -19 brings this issue to the forefront, as reported 
mortality is exceptionally high in CLL patients (up to 33%).  [35]I n summary, available evidence

CONFIDENTIAL   suggests that the potential benefits of achieving seroprotection following vaccination outweighs 
the risks of undergoing a brief BTKi treatment break.  
 Potential Risks and Benefi ts 
2.5.1 Potential Risks  
The potential risks of participating in this trial are those associated with having blood drawn, the IM injection, possible reactions to mRNA -1273, and breach of confidentiality. 
Blood Draw: Drawing blood may cause transient discomfort and fainting. Fainting is usually transient and managed by [CONTACT_746998]/her legs. Bruising at the 
blood draw site may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_746999] a few minutes after the blood is taken. IM injection may also cause transient discomfort and fainting. Drawing blood and IM injection may cause infection. The use of aseptic (sterile) technique will make infection a t the site where blood will be drawn or where the vaccination will 
be given extremely unlikely. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG): Other than possibly experiencing some minor skin irritation from the 
electrodes, there are no anticipated risks related to complete the electrocardiogram and/or the 
echocardiogram  
Anaphylaxis: Immediate systemic allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) can occur following any 
vaccination. These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per 450,[ADDRESS_1021933] 15 minutes after vaccination. 
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by [CONTACT_747000] c aused by [CONTACT_747001]. Therefore, it is 
important that standard precautions and procedures be followed to avoid injury from fainting.  
Intramuscular injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by [CONTACT_289647], Inc., containing 
the SM -102 lipid formulation commonly results in a transient and self -limiting local inflammatory 
reaction. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_14264], erythema (redness), or swel ling (hardness) at the injection 
site, which are mostly mild -to-moderate in severity and usually occur within [ADDRESS_1021934] been 
observed at dose of mRNA -1273 exceeding the dose proposed in this study. As with other IM 
injections, the Sponsor’s COVID -[ADDRESS_1021935] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  [ADDRESS_1021936] commonly reported systemic adverse reactions (ARs) are anticipated to be fever, fatigue, 
chills, headache, myalgias and arthralgias. More severe react ions, including erythema, induration, 
fever, headache and nausea, were reported after receiving doses of mRNA -1273 that were greater 
than the dose proposed for use in this study. In all cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously.  
Laboratory abnormalities (including increases in liver functional tests and serum lipase levels) 
following vaccination were observed in clinical studies with similar mRNA -based vaccines. These 
abnormalities were without clinical symptoms or signs and returned toward baseline (Day 1) values over time. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown. Further details are provided in the current IB.  
If COVID- [ADDRESS_1021937] vaccine dose (0.5 mL) appears to be only moderately effective  in 
increasing antibody titers. Patients should be counseled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID- 19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should be 
vaccinated as appropriate for their health status.  
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent the novel viral infection caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV- [ADDRESS_1021938] (formalin -inactivated whole virus) and designed to protect 
children against infection with RSV [ 36] or measles [37].

proposed as a possible explanation for cases of more serious disease associated wit h dengue 
vaccination [ 38]. I t is  not known if mRNA -[ADDRESS_1021939] in animals that were vaccinated with mRNA -1273 [ 14] [ 17]. 
Direct measurement of Th1 -directed responses in mice a nd NHPs, indirect measurement of 
IgG2a/c/IgG1 antibody subclasses in mice, and the high levels of neutralizing antibody in all species lessens concerns regarding disease enhancement associated with administration of mRNA -
1273.

Data from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that the known and potential benefits of the 
Moderna COVID- 19 Vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine. In the Phase 
1 and 2 clinical studies, a consistent dose response was observed across age groups by [CONTACT_747002]. The prespecified primary efficacy results from the phase 3 trial of mRNA01273 (also known as Study

(N=30,351) demonstrated vaccine efficacy (VE) of 94.1% (95% CI: 89.3%, 96.8%) for the prevention of symptomatic confirmed COVID -19 (p < 0.0001).  This finding is based on [ADDRESS_1021942] 14 days after the second vaccination (11 cases in the mRNA- 1273 arm and 185 in the placebo arm).  The mRNA- [ADDRESS_1021943] public use.

full-length, prefusion stabilized spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein of SARS -CoV- 2 manufactured by [CONTACT_14358], 
Inc. in a specific population of patients with either hematologic malignancies under active 
treatment or patients with solid tumors who are undergoing treatment with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors.  
For the vaccine -naïve cohorts, the vaccine will be administered in 2 doses , 28 days apart .  Up to 
80 participants will be enrolled into one of four vaccine -naïve cohorts. Participants will receive an 
IM injection (0.5 mL) of mRNA -[ADDRESS_1021946] second vaccination (Day 394). 
For the booster -vaccine cohorts, the booster vaccine will be administered in a single dose.  Up to 
120 participant s will be enrolled into one of 6 booster- vaccine cohorts. Participants will receive an 
IM injection (0.5 mL) of mRNA -[ADDRESS_1021947] vaccination (Day 360). For participants who choose to receive an additional 
(second) booster dose of the vaccine, the second booster dose of mRNA -[ADDRESS_1021948] 4 weeks after their previous dose of the vaccine.  Note: Participants 
may enroll on this study only to receive a second or a third booster dose and will be counted/analyzed in the identified booster- vaccine cohorts.  
Participants initially enrolled in the vaccine naïve cohort will also have the option to receive the 
first booster dose no less than 4 weeks after their second dose ; with the similar option for a second  
or third  booster on the same schedule as the booster -vaccine cohorts . If they choose to receive this, 
they will adhere to the booster vaccine calendar and will be analyzed also as part of the booster 
vaccine group .   
Safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_747003] (SMC) as explained 
in section  8.10.1.

4.2.1 Preparation  
Vials of frozen or refrigerated mRNA -1273 should be removed from freezing or refrigeration 
temperatures and allowed to equilibrate to room temperature (20ºC to 25ºC).  
1. Gently invert the mRNA -[ADDRESS_1021960] will be administered as an IM injection into the deltoid muscle on a 2 -dose 
injection schedule on Day 1 and Day 29 (+/- 3 days). Each injection will have a volume of 0.5 mL 
and contain mRNA- 1273 100 µg. The IP will be prepared for injection as a single 0.5 mL dose for 
each participant.  The investigator will designate medically qualified personnel to administer the IP according to the procedures stipulated in this study protocol and Pharmacy Manual. Study-specific training will be provided.  
At each visit when IP is administered, participants will be monitored for a minimum of 15  minutes 
after administration. Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring for local or systemic reactions ( Appendix E: Study Calendar ). 
Eligibility  for a subsequent dose of IP is determined by [CONTACT_363989]  
5.1.   
 Dose  Modification for an Individual  Participant  
No dose modifications are  allowed. 
 Accountability Procedures for mRNA- 1273 Vaccine  
Once received  from the pharmaceutical partner at each site , the investigational products will  be 
stored in and dispensed by [CONTACT_156979].   
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires accounting for the disposition of all 
investigational products. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that a current record of 
NIH Protocol [ADDRESS_1021961] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  [ADDRESS_1021962] be available for inspection by [CONTACT_747007] a regulatory 
agency (e.g., FDA) at any time. An assigned Study Monitor will review the pharmacy records. 
At study termination, all unused investigational product will be disposed in accordance with the 
pharmacy’s instructions  following complete drug accountability and monitoring. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the personnel maintain accurate records in an IP accountability log of receipt of all IP, inventory at the site, dispensing of mRNA -1273, IP 
injections, and return to the Moderna or alternative disposition of used/unused products.  A site 
monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during site visits and at the completion of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA-1273-P301 Pharmacy Manual. 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_746945]. 
Once fully reconciled at the site at the end of the study, the IP can be destroyed at the investigational site or at a Moderna - selected third party, as appropriate.  Investigational product 
may be destroyed at the study site only if permitted by [CONTACT_747008] . A Certificate of Destruction must be completed and sent to the Sponsor or designee.  
 Study Treatment Compliance  
All doses of the investigational study product (IP) will be administered at the study site by [CONTACT_747009] (date and time) in the participant’s medical records. If a participant does not receive vaccine , does not receive a full dose of vaccine,  
or does not receive all of the planned doses, the reason for the missed  or partial dose will be 
recorded.  
Participants in the vaccine- naïve cohorts who miss the second dose of IP due to noncompliance 
with the visit schedule and not due to a safety pause wi ll still be required to follow the per protocol  
visit and testing schedule. Unless consent is withdrawn, a participant who withdraws or is withheld 
from receiving the second dose of study vaccine , if in the vaccine- naïve cohorts , will remain in the 
study and complete all safety and immunogenicity assessments required through the participant’s scheduled end of study.  The study site is responsible for ensuring that participants comply with 
the study windows allowed. 
If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_747010]  
a visit within the allowed  visit window (Study Calendar , Appendix   insert). If a participant does 
not complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be classified as a missed visit and the  
participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requirements of the  
missed visit will be captured and included in the subsequent visit (e.g., clinical laboratory testing,  
memory aid s review for reactogenicity, immunologic testing, as applicable).

CONFIDENTIAL   7.1.2 Physical Examination  
At screening or Day 0 visit, a targeted physical exam will be performed based on participant’s 
clinical history and height and weight will be collected. Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_667270]) will be collected at screening an d prior to each vaccination. The 
exam will be performed by [CONTACT_747014]/systems: supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdomen, skin.  
At visits following the first vaccination a targeted physical examination may be conducted based on interim medical history.  
7.1.3 Reactogenicity Assessments  
Will include brief history for assessment of AE/SAEs just prior to and following vaccination, which includes an assessment of pain, tenderness, erythema, induration and warmth at the injection site; fever, chills, arthralgia/joint pain, malaise/fatigue, my algia/body aches, headache, nausea, 
vomiting and abdominal pain.  
The vaccination site will be examined at the end of the 15- minute observation period following 
each vaccination on Day 1 and Day 29 if applicable  as well as all other timepoints if indicated.  
7.1.4 Memory aids 
Following each vaccination, all participant s will complete a participant  memory aid  for 8 days 
(Days 1 -8 [all participants] and Days 29-36 [participants in the vaccine naïve cohort only]).  
Following each vaccination, and if applicable at Day 8 visits, memory aids will be reviewed with 
the participant. The study staff objective assessment of the reactogenicity will be documented.  
Memory aids are not source documents and will be used as a tool for the study team to interview 
the participants about their reactogenicity. The study team will fill up the source, based on the memory aid and the source is captured in the database. The mem ory aids themselves will be 
destroyed. 
 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
7.2.1 General  
All ongoing medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_746947].  
Concomitant medications will include all current medications and medications taken within the 30 days prior to enrollment (prescription and over -the- counter drugs, vitamins and supplements, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], and vaccinations) through 34 days after the second vaccination (approximately Day 57- 60 for participants who receive both doses of vaccine or early termination (if prior to Day

7.2.2 For Hematologic Malignancies Cohorts:  
[IP_ADDRESS] Supportive Care  
• Supportive care measures including blood products, infection prophylaxis and growth factors will be administered according to institutional guidelines.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications  
Recommendations with regard to specific types of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], supportive care; diet and other interventions are as follows:  
• Concomitant medications are recommended as prophylaxis for nausea, vomiting, and infections, and are recommended according to institutional standards. Myelosuppression is expected in participants with acute leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma, or post -stem cell 
transplantation due to underlying disease, as well as due to chemotherapy, or both. Many participants may have neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or both at study entry.  
• Significant or life -threatening myelosuppression may be managed with growth factor 
support and blood transfusion according to institutional standard of care, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Practice Guidelines, and/or NCCN Practice Guidelines.   
• Infections secondary to myelosuppression are common in participants with hematologic malignancies, and may be related to underlying disease, chemotherapy, or both. Therefore, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal agents, and antiviral agents is r ecommended 
according to institutional standards.  
• If a prohibited medication is considered essential for the participant well-being, 
continuation on study with concomitant administration of such medication(s) will need to be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_458]. 
 Laboratory Evaluations 
All clinical safety testing will be conducted at CLIA certified laboratories at each site. Blood 
specimens be obtained in accordance with the study calendar  (Appendix C). Blood samples 
collected for immunology analyses  and immune assessments  at non-NIH site s will be processed 
at Moderna Inc. and the NIH using a standardized research operating protocol. 
7.3.1 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
• Urine or serum pregnancy tests will be performed within one week prior to each 
vaccination on all female participant s of childbearing potential. Results must be known 
prior to each vaccination.  (In order to reduce burden on female participants of childbearing potential, the vaccine doses can be prepared and verified, but not administered, while results of the pregnancy test are pending.)

o CBC with differential and platelet count,  
o Chemistry panels including: Acute care panel (Na+, K+, Cl -, total CO2, creatinine, 
glucose, blood urea nitrogen), and Hepatic panel (AST/GOT, ALT/GPT, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) 
o LDH (only collected from participants with CLL) 
o Beta-2 microglobulin (only collected from participants with CLL) 
7.3.2 Serological Immunogenicity Endpoint Assays 
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected  before administration of study 
treatment. The following analytes will be measured: 
• Serum bAb levels against SARS -CoV- 2 as measured by [CONTACT_177735]- binding assay specific to 
the SARS -CoV-2 S protein 
• Serum bAb levels against SARS -CoV- 2 as measured by [CONTACT_177735]- binding assay specific to 
the SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein 
• Serum nAb titer against SARS -CoV- 2 as measured by [CONTACT_340053]/or live virus 
neutralization assays  
Serum will be tested using the ligand -binding assay specific to the SARS -CoV- 2 nucleocapsid to 
determine the immunologic status of study participants at baseline and assess for seroconversion due to infection during the course of the study. Serum from a subset of participants will be tested in the other assays. The selection of the subset and timepoints to be tested are described in the 
statistical analysis plan. Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that adequate vial volumes may allow for further testing.  
The  date of each sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be used to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking and storage. Handling and preparation of the code d samples for analysis, as well as 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_76818], will be provided in a separate study manual.

• Saliva collection procedure:  
Participants are asked to refrain from eating or drinking [ADDRESS_1022017] their lips up to the orifice of the 50 mL falcon (“kiss the opening”) and push/squeeze the saliva that pools in the floor of their mouth into the orifice of the 50 mL falcon. Participants will be  asked to expectorate every 30 seconds for 2 -5 minutes. Ideally, 2- 4 mL of saliva should 
be collected.  
• Saliva specimen processing:  
Saliva (1mL) can be transferred to individual 2.0 mL screw -top conical tubes ( Sarstedt 2.0 
screw cap vials  preferred ) using a P1000 pi[INVESTIGATOR_746952] a sterile transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_8459] (actual volume can 
vary significantly).  This would be 2- 3 tubes/ participant . These tubes should be stored frozen 
at -80C for long term storage.

(LTIB) at the NCI’s Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and include flow cytometry -based and 
serum assays.  
 Studies may be performed in select participants where adequate samples are available:  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)  
•  PBMCs may be analyzed for changes in standard immune cell types (CD4 and CD8 T 
cells, natural killer [NK] cells, regulatory T cells [Tregs], myeloid -derived suppressor cells 
[MDSCs], and dendritic cells) as well as over 120 immune cell subsets, as describ ed 
elsewhere [ 41, 42]  
•  PBMCs from selected subjects may be analyzed for function of specific immune cell subsets, including CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, Tregs, and MDSCs.  
• PBMCs may be analyzed for immune responses against SARS Co -V2 using an intracellular 
cytokine staining assay. PBMCs will be stimulated in vitro with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15- mer 
peptide pools encoding proteins of SARS Co -V2 (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_179890], nucleoprotein) ; 
control peptide pools will involve the use of human leukocyte antigen peptide as a negative control and CEFT peptide mix as a positive control. CEFT is a mixture of peptides of CMV,

T cells will involve the production of IFN -γ, IL -2, TNF, and the degranulation marker 
CD107a. A detailed description of this assay has been previously reported [ 43].  
Soluble Factors/Serology  
• Samples for soluble factor analysis will be collected as per Study Calendar. Sera and/or 
plasma may be analyzed pre- and post -therapy for changes in soluble factors (e.g. sCD27, 
sCD40L, sPD -1, sPD -L1), and cytokines (e.g.  IFN-γ, IL -10, IL -12, IL -2, IL -4, etc.), 
chemokines, antibodies, tumor -associated antigens, and/or other markers using ELISA or 
multiplexed assays (e.g. Mesoscale, Luminex, cytokine bead array).  
• Coded, linked samples will be sent to Quest for antibody analysis. The code will not be 
shared with Quest.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional assays:  
• Blood samples may be used for additional research studies, which may include phenotypic 
and functional analysis of immune -cell subsets, and analyses for other cytokines (IFN -γ, 
IL-10, IL -12, IL -2, IL -4, etc.), chemokines, antibodies, and/or other markers. Additionally , 
blood samples may be used for whole or targeted high throughput genome sequencing on which bioinformatic analysis of immune system modulating genomic loci such as the IGHV region and the KIR region could be performed.

 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 Assessing and Recording  Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_747019] V5 , which is available here:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/ctcae_v5_quick_refere
nce_5x7.pdf  
The CTCAE utilizes the System Organ Class (SOC)  terminology derived from MedDRA in order 
to organize the adverse events into app ropriate sections.  SOC reflects  the highest level of the 
MedDRA1 hierarchy.  Each SOC  is identified by [CONTACT_747020], an 
etiology, or a purpose (e.g., SOC Investigations for laboratory test results). CTCAE terms are 
grouped by [CONTACT_75493]. Within each SOC, AEs are listed and accompanied by [CONTACT_75494] (Grade).    
If the CTCAE V5 does not have the required term, investigators are encouraged to consult MedDRA (https://www.meddra.org/) in order to utilize the appropriate MedDRA term.  Within each SOC, the final adverse event term allows for a free text “Other” term.  If investigators are 
unable to find a specific term describing the adverse event within CTCAE, investigators should utilize the free text “Other” terminology and report the appropriate MedDRA term.  This will enable appropriate comparisons of with the mRNA-[ADDRESS_1022029] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  64 
CONFIDENTIAL   8.1.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
ICH E6 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation 
Participant  administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relationship to the study 
treatment.  FDA defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product.  The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12189], or upon review by a study monitor.  
All AEs, including solicited local (injection site) and systemic ( subjective  and quantitative) 
reactions , will be captured on the appropriate data collection form and eCRF.   Information to be 
collected for AEs includes event description, date  of onset, assessment of severity , relationship to 
study product and alternate etiology  (assessed only by [CONTACT_31278] a diagnosis  and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as  an investigator), date of resolution, 
seriousness and outcome.  AEs occurring during the trial collection and reporting period will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the Participant  is screened will be considered 
as baseline and not reported as an AE.  However, if the severity of any pre -existing medical 
condition increases, it should be recorded as an AE. If an event meets both the criteria of a study endpoint and an adverse event, the event will be 
reported either as a study endpoint or as an adverse event (not both). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Grading  
All AEs  (laboratory and clinical symptoms) will be graded for severity and assessed for 
relationship to study product  (see definitions) . AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The start and stop date of each reported AE 
will be recorded on the appropriate data collection form and eCRF.  Changes in the severity of an 
AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Severity of Event:   
The severity of unsolicited AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_747021] ( NCI-CTCAE ) version 5.0. 
The severity of solicited AEs  will be assessed by [CONTACT_747022] “ Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials ” .  
The following grading system utilized for the events not listed in the above scales :  
* Mild (Grade 1):  Events that are usually transient and may require only minimal or no 
treatment or therapeutic intervention and generally do not interfere with the Participant’s 
usual activities  of daily living. 
o T ransient: Duration less than [ADDRESS_1022030] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  65 
CONFIDENTIAL   o Therapeutic Intervention: An action to alleviate the adverse event that does not require 
a medication or medical procedure, such as a change in diet, or application of cool pack or warm compress, or rest  
* Moderate (Grade 2) :  Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
o T
herapeutic Intervention: Use of non- narcotic pain reliever or over -the-counter 
medication  
* Severe (Grade 3) :  Events interrupt usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  Severe events are usually 
incapacitating.  
o A ctivities of Daily Living (ADLs): Negative impact on ADLs, such as missed work, 
unable to do housework or exercise 
o Significantly Affects Clinical Status: A medically attended event – clinical care was 
sought from a healthcare professional  
o Intensive Therapeutic Intervention: Required prescription medication, or intravenous fluids or medical procedure  
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Product:  
The assessment of the AE’s relationship to study product will be done by [CONTACT_747023] [ADDRESS_1022031] will be assessed for AEs using the terms related or not related:  
* Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the AE . 
Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the AE . 
* Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the event. 
8.1.2 R eactogenicity (Solicited AE) 
Reactogenicity events are AEs that are common and known to occur following administration of this type of study vaccine. Study clinicians will follow and collect resolution information for any  
reactogenicity symptoms that are not resolved within 7 days.  
Solicited AEs (i.e., reactogenicity) will be collected using memory aids  and recorded on the  
appropriate source document  from the time of each vaccination through [ADDRESS_1022032] each 
vaccination (Days  1-[ADDRESS_1022033] vaccination, and Days 29- 36 for the second vaccination if 
applicable ).

8.1.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event (see section  8.1.4 ) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled 
surgery/chemotherapy arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400094] -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event. 
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is solely driven by [CONTACT_105]- medical reasons (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_746955]) is not considered a serious adverse event.  
o Emergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62489] a serious adverse event. The reason for seeking medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or Participant and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

CONFIDENTIAL   8.1.4 Life-threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or Participant at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32) 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1022036] (AESIs)  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) represent any events for which additional data  (besides 
the standard AE data) are desired. These may be at the request of the regulatory agency,  
pharmaceutical  partner or the Sponsor, and driven by a regulatory requirement, or known or 
potential risk  from the product or class.  
AESIs will include:  
• Hypersensitivity reactions and other allergic reactions 
• Hyperimmune responses 
• Thrombocytopenia 
• Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the thin tissue surrounding the heart [the pericardium]) . These will be based on the CDC case 
definition  criteria [44] of these conditions.  
• SAEs considered related to the vaccine

• Recorded on the appropriate SAE report form, the medical record and captured in the clinical database.  
• Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637] -investigator. 
An abnormal laboratory value which cannot be attributed to chemotherapy for malignancy will be recorded in the database as an AE only if the laboratory abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_117162]:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Is judged by [CONTACT_52374]  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will provide details about the action taken with respect to the study intervention and about the participant’s outcome.  
 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Any AE that meets protocol -defined serious criteria or meets the definition of Adverse Event of 
Special Interest that require expedited reporting must be submitted immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) to OSRO Safety using the CCR SAE report form.   
All SAE reporting must include the elements described in section 8.4 
SAE reports will be submitted to the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at:

engaged in the research will have any part in the decisions as to the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate a pregnancy and individuals engaged in the  research will have no part in 
determining the viability of a neonate.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an SAE.  
The outcome of all pregnancies should be followed up and documented  per stand of care.  The 
investigator should notify the Sponsor no later than [ADDRESS_1022042] vaccination . 
Pregnancy of the participant ’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies occurring from the date of the first vaccine dose until [ADDRESS_1022043] dose 
should, if possible, be followed up and documented. Pregnant partners may be offered the 
opportunity to participate in an institutional pregnancy registry protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP 
pregnancy registry study) to provide data about the outcome of the pregnancy for safety reporting purposes. 
 Regulatory Reporting for Studies Conducted Under CCR -Sponsored IND  
Following notification from the investigator, CCR, the IND sponsor, will report any suspected 
adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected.  CCR will report an AE as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relatio nship between the study product and 
the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potent ial serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible,

after administration of vaccine that is considered related to vaccine.  
• Two (2) or more participant s experience an allergic reaction such as generalized urticaria 
defined as occurring at three or more body parts within 72 hours after administration of vaccine that is considered related to vaccine.  
• Any participant  experiences suspected or confirmed myocarditis and/or pericarditis related 
to the study vaccine within 6 weeks of administration.  
• Any serious adverse event deemed related to the vaccine will result in a halt to study accrual 
and an ad hoc meeting of the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).  After a discussion of 
the event, the decision will be made as to whether to halt further accrual  or lift the hold on 
accrual, based on the facts of the case and emerging evidence.   Participant s already on trial 
who successfully completed the first dose without incident will be allowed to receive the 
second dose of the vaccine, as per the mRNA -1273 va ccine’s Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA) granted in December 2020.

 Sponsor Protocol Deviation Reporting  
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non- compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual of 
Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol- specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support of the clinical trial.  
Non-NIH participating sites not using the CCR Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) will 
report any protocol deviation on the OSRO Site Protocol Non-Adherence/Deviation Log, or a 
site-generated protocol deviation report approved by [CONTACT_62554]. The Non-Adherence/Deviation Log 
should be maintained in the site essential documents file and submitted to OSRO via [EMAIL_11074] on the first business day of each month  
 throughout the 
study .  
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation  identified by [CONTACT_747025] (PDTS) online application. 
The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and maintained per CCR 
PDTS user requirements . In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the 
participant’s source records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required 
protocol deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 
4.5 Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol deviations. 
 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure : 
• that the rights of the participants are protected ;  
• that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and standard operating procedures; and,  
• the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.   
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol -specific, risk -based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
NIH Protocol [ADDRESS_1022048] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  [ADDRESS_1022049] a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non- compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.  
OSRO SROS  Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. T he first activity is before the study starts to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close- Out Visit (COV).  
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study site(s). 
Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action items or 
follow -up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring reports 
will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, coordinating center (if applicable), and the Sponsor regulatory file.  
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting t o the Sponsor and as applicable per 
institutional and IRB guidance.

 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a trial 
and continuing throughout the individual’s trial participation.  Before any study procedures are performed, informed consent will be obtained in -person or remotely (e.g., via telephone or other 
NIH/local  approved remote secure internet -based platforms  used in compliance with policy  
including HRPP Policy 303) and documented.  Participants  will receive a concise and focused 
presentation of key information about the clinical trial, verbally and with a  physical or electronic  
consent form. The explanation will be organized and presented in lay terminology and language that facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate.  
An investigator or designee will describe the protocol to potential participants  in-person or 
remotely . The key information about the purpose of the study, the procedures and experimental 
aspects of the study, risks and discomforts, any expected benefits to the Participant , and alternative 
treatment will be presented first to the Participant .   
Participants  will also receive an explanation that the trial involves research, and a detailed 
summary of the proposed study procedures and study interventions/products.  This will include 
aspects of the trial that are experimental, the probability for random assignment to treatment groups, any expected benefits, all possible risks (including a statement that the particular treatment or procedure may involve risks to the Participant  or to the embryo or fetus, if the Participant  is or 
may become pregnant, that are currently unforeseeable), the expected duration of the Participant ’s 
participation in the trial, alternative procedures that may be available and the important potential benefits and risks of these available alternative procedures.  
Participants  will be informed that they will be notified in a timely manner if information becomes 
available that may be relevant to their willingness to continue participation in the trial. Participants  
will receive an explanation as to whether any compensation and any medical treatments are available if injury occurs, and, if so, what they consist of, or where further information may be obtained. Participants  will be informed of the anticipated financial expenses, if any, to the 
Participant  for participat ing in the trial, as well as any anticipated prorated payments, if any, to the 
Participant  for participating in the trial. They will be informed of whom to contact (e.g., the 
investigator) for answers to any questions relating to the research project.  
Information will also include the foreseeable circumstances and/or reasons under which the 
Participant ’s participation in the trial may be terminated. The participants will be informed that 
participation is voluntary and that they are free to withdraw from the study for any reason at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which the Participant is otherwise entitled.

be informed that applicable data protection legislation will be followed. Participants  will be 
informed that the monitor(s), auditors(s), IRB, NIH, and regulatory authority(ies) will be granted 
direct access to the Participant ’s original medical records for verification of clinical trial 
procedures and/or data without violating the confidentiality of the Participant , to the extent 
permitted by [CONTACT_4913], and that, by [CONTACT_2960] a written informed consent form, the Participant is authorizing such access.  
Participants  will be informed that records identifying the Participant  will be kept confidential, and, 
to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available and, if the results of the trial are published, the Participant ’s identity will remain 
confidential. Participants  will be informed whether private information collected from this 
research and/or specimens will be used for additional research, even if identifiers are removed.    
Participants  will be allowed sufficient time to consider participation in this research trial and have 
the opportunity to discuss this trial with their family, friends or legally authorized representative, or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.  
Informed consent forms will be IRB -approved and participants will be asked to read and review 
the consent form. Participants  must sign the informed consent form prior to starting any study 
procedures being done specifically for this trial. 
Once signed, a copy of the informed consent form will be given to the Participant (s) for their 
records.  The Participant (s) may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial.  
The rights and welfare of the Participant (s) will be protected by [CONTACT_261682]. 
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or on the electronic document.

 Exclusion of Women, Minorities, and Children (Special Populations)  
Both men and women are eligible for this trial if they meet eligibility criteria. Participants  from all 
racial and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. All participants meeting the criteria listed in section 2.1 are eligible for enrollment. 
There are no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of 2019 nCov 
Vaccine in  partic ipants <18  years of age; therefore, children are  excluded from this study.  
 Participant  Confidentiality  
Participant  confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and 
the sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality includes documentation, investigation data, 
Participant ’s clinical information, and all other information generated during participation in the 
study. No information concerning the study or the data generated from the study will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the CCR  and the Participant . 
Participant  confidentiality will be maintained when study results are published or discussed in 
conferences.  The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor or governmental regulatory agencies may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the participants  in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.

CCR/ NCI/NIH  [ADDRESS_1022055] be released in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the Participant  from voluntarily releasing 
information about themselves or their involvement in this research.  If any person or agency obtains 
a written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the Certificate to withhold that informatio n.   
The Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent the researchers from reporting without the Participant ’s consent, information that would identify the Participant  as a participant in the 
research project regarding matters that must be legally reported including: child and elder abuse, sexual abuse, or wanting to harm themselves or others.   
The release of individual private information or specimens for other research will only occur if 
c
onsent was obtained from the individual to whom the information, document, or biospecimen 
pertains , or for  the purposes of other research that is in compliance with applicable Federal regulations 
governing the protection of human participants  in research.

 Final Analysis Plan  
11.4.1 Populations for Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all participants who a) receive at least one study injection, 
b) have baseline (Day 1) data available for those analyses that require baseline data, and c) have at least one post -injection assessment for the analysis endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Per-Protocol Set 
The Per -Protocol (PP) Set consists of all FAS participants who meet all of the following criteria:  
• Complied with the injection schedule.  
NIH Protocol [ADDRESS_1022060] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  79 
CONFIDENTIAL   • Complied with the timings of immunogenicity blood sampling to have post -injection 
results available for at least one assay component corresponding to the immunogenicity 
analysis objective.  
• Have had no major protocol deviations that impact immune response during the period corresponding to the immunogenicity analysis objective.  
The PP Set will serve as the primary set for the analysis of immunogenicity data in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Solicited Safety Set  
The Solicited Safety Set consists of all participants who received at least one study injection, and 
contribute any solicited AR data; i.e., have at least one post -baseline solicited safety assessment. 
The Solicited Safety Set will be used for the analyses  of solicited ARs.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Set  
The Safety Set consists of all participants who received at least one study injection. The Safety Set 
will be used for analysis of safety except for the solicited ARs.  
11.4.2 Statistical Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenicity Analyses 
The analyses of immunogenicity will be based on the PP Set. If the number of participants in the FAS and PP Set differ (defined as the difference divided by [CONTACT_14334]) by [CONTACT_726] 10%, supportive analyses of immunogenicity may be conducted using the FAS.  
For the primary immunogenicity endpoint, geometric mean titer (GMT) of specific bAb with corresponding 95% CI at each timepoint and geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of specific bAb with corresponding 95% CI at each post -baseline timepoint over pre -injection  baseline at Day 1 
will be provided. Descriptive summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided. 
For the secondary immunogenicity endpoint, GMT of specific nAb with corresponding 95% CI at 
each timepoint and GMFR of specific nAb with corresponding 95% CI at each post -baseline 
timepoint over pre -injection baseline at Day 1 will be provided. Descriptive  summary statistics 
including median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided. For summarizations of GMT 
values, antibody values reported as below the LLOQ will be replaced by 0.5 × LLOQ. Values that are greater than the upper limit of quantification (U LOQ) will be converted to the ULOQ. 
The number and percentage of participants with GMFR ≥ 2, GMFR ≥ 3, and GMFR ≥ 4 of serum SARS -CoV-2- specific nAb titers and participants with seroconversion due to vaccination from 
baseline will be provided with 2 -sided 95% CI using the Clopper -Pearson met hod at each post -
baseline timepoint. Seroconversion at a participant level is defined as :  
• For subjects with no detectable antibody titer (< LOD) at baseline: post-vaccination titer ≥ LLOQ  
• For subjects with a positive baseline titer (> LOD): post- vaccination titer ≥ [ADDRESS_1022061] 2023  
 
CCR/ NCI/NIH  80 
CONFIDENTIAL   • For subjects with a baseline titer ≥ LLOQ: post- vaccination titer ≥ a 4 -fold rise

GMT with corresponding 95% CI will be provided (for each group) at each time point. The 95% 
CI will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log -transformed values and transformed 
back to the original scale for presentation.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses 
Safety and reactogenicity will be assessed by [CONTACT_747028] (local and systemic events), unsolicited AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, safety laboratory test results, vital signs, and physical e xamination findings. 
Solicited ARs and unsolicited AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term according to the MedDRA for adverse reaction terminology. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine  Clinical Trials (DHHS 
2007) is used in this study with modification for rash, solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, and vital signs.  
Rash will be graded as: 
• Grade 0 = no rash  
• Grade 1 = localized without associated symptoms 
• Grade 2 = maculopapular rash covering < 50% body surface area 
• Grade 3 = urticarial rash covering > 50% body surface area 
• Grade 4 = generalized exfoliative, ulcerative or bullous dermatitis  
All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set, except summaries of solicited ARs which will 
be based on the Solicited Safety Set. All safety analyses will be provided overall and by [CONTACT_9084].  
The number and percentage of participants with any solicited local AR, with any solicited systemic 
AR and with any solicited AR during the 7 -day follow -up period after each injection will be 
provided with a 2-sided 95% exact CI using the Clopper-Pearson method.  
Number and percentage of participants with unsolicited AEs, SAEs, Grade 3 or higher ARs and 
AEs, treatment -related AEs and SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation from study vaccine or 
participation in the study will be summarized. Unsolicited AEs will be  summarized by [CONTACT_524771]/or preferred term coded by [CONTACT_61132].  
For treatment- emergent safety laboratory tests results, the raw values and change from baseline 
values will be summarized by [CONTACT_11191].

 Appendix C: Leukemia -specific AE Recording & Re porting Guidelines  
These guidelines will be followed for the recording and reporting of adverse and serious adverse 
events.  
a) Baseline events will be recorded in the medical history section of the case report form and will include the terminology event name, grade, and start date of the event. Baseline events are any medical condition, symptom, or clinically significant lab  abnormality present before the informed consent is signed. 
i) Hematologic laboratory abnormalities will not be recorded as baseline  
ii) events for participants with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome,  
iii) chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase. 
iv) If exact start date is unknown, month and year or year may be used as the  start date 
of the baseline event. 
b) The maximum grade of the adverse event will be captured per course or protocol defined visit date.  
c) These adverse events will be recorded in the case report form:  
i) Any grade adverse event that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug(s). 
ii) All serious adverse events regardless of attribution to the study drug(s).  
iii) Any grade adverse event regardless of attribution to the study drug(s) that results 
in any dose modification. 
d) Hematologic adverse events will not be recorded or reported for studies in participants with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or  chronic 
myeloid leukemia in blast phase except for:  
i) Prolonged myelosuppression as defined by [CONTACT_6812] -CTCAE criteria specific for 
leukemia, e.g., marrow hypocellularity on day 42 or later (6 weeks) from start of 
therapy without evidence of leukemia (< 5% blasts), or that results in dose modifications, interruptions or meets the protocol definition of DLT or SAE.  
e) Serious adverse events will be reported according to institutional policy.  
f) Protocol specific language regarding the recording and reporting of adverse and serious adverse events will be followed in the event of discordance between the protocol and Leukemia-specific adverse event recording and reporting guidelines.

information surrounding a COVID19 infection, should this occur.  Physical examination will be optional for p articipant s transitioning 
from Vaccine -Naïve Cohorts. 
b) Hematology and Chemistry: Clinical screening laboratory evaluations will include tests as mentioned in the table . Participants with CLL 
will also have LDH and Beta -2 microglobulin drawn on Days 1, 29 and 57.  Results from laboratory evaluations will not be required 
prior to administering the vaccine on participants  transitioning from Vaccine -Naïve Cohorts. 
c) For women of childbearing potential serum/urine pregnancy test within one week  of vaccination with results confirmed as negative prior 
to administration the vaccination.  Results of the pregnancy test will not be required prior to verifying the order. 
d) Participants on the booster vaccine cohorts will receive an injection of mRNA -[ADDRESS_1022102] vaccination (Day 360). Participants will receive proof of vaccination.  
e) In-person clinical visits will occur at screening, and on Baseline/Days 1 (may occur on same day), 29, 57, 180 and at 360. These visits at 
clinic will take approximately 4 -6 hours.  
f) Participants with CLL will  have LDH and Beta -[ADDRESS_1022103] safety 
labs drawn at this visit.  
g) If a participant elects to have a second or third booster vaccination on protocol, the date of administration of the last dose will be considered Day  1. The minimum timeframe between booster vaccination doses will be 28 days.  Day 57, Day 180, and Day 360 
timepoints, if not yet reached on the original booster vaccination on protocol will be timed according to the participant’s last vaccination dose. 
h) Collection of all AEs from the participant, solicited and unsolicited, will occur during the period from study product administration on Day [ADDRESS_1022104] 
vaccine, only if they are related to the study intervention. 
i) The ECG may be performed up to 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after Day 29.

 CONFIDENTIAL   PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Number:  ALY337-201 
Title:  A Phase 1/2a Randomized, Double-masked, Placebo-
controlled, Dose- ranging Study of the Safety and Efficacy of 
H-1337 in Subjects with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma 
(POAG) or Ocular Hypertension  
Study Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
• Evaluate the local ocular and systemic safety of three 
concentrations of H-1337 in subjects with POAG or ocular 
hypertension treated daily for up to 28 days  
Secondary Objectives:  
• Evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of H -1337  
• Evaluate the systemic ph armacokinetics of H -1337  
Study Design:  The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary 
efficacy of three concentrations of H -1337 and vehicle 
administered twice daily (BID)  in a parallel group, double-
masked design for 28 days of dosing.  Approximately 75-100 
subjects will be enrolled.  The study will include the following 
cohorts: 
  H-1337 0.06% (n=20) H-1337 0.2% (n = 20) H-1337 0.6% (n = 20) Control (Vehicle) (n = 20)  Dosing will be BID unilaterally in the study eye for the first 3 days, then BID OU from Day 4 to Day 28.    Efficacy assessments will be based upon the study eye.  The study eye will be the eye that meets the entry intraocular pressure (IOP) criteria after washout.  Should both eyes meet the criteria then the study eye will be defined as the eye with the higher 8 am IOP on Baseline ( Day 0).  If both eyes have the 
same 8 am IOP on Baseline ( Day 0), the study eye will be the 
right eye.  
 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_715495] (23 to 26 mmHg and > 26 to 32 mmHg at 8 am).  H-1337 and its vehicle 
will be packaged in identical bottles.

30. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 5 years. 
31. Related to site study staff and/or site employees.  
 
Number of Subject s: Approximately 75 – [ADDRESS_974574] s will be enrolled  
Number of Sites : Approximately 4-8 US sites 
Duration of Study:  Screening Visit:   1 day 
Washout Period:  up to approximately 6 weeks ( + 1 week) 
depending on pre-study ocular hypotensive therapy and subject/site availability  
Treatment Period:  28 days   
Study Assessments:  The following study assessments and procedures will be 
performed:  
• Medical and ophthalmic history (including prior and concomitant medications)  
• Adverse events  
• IP Compliance 
• Heart rate and  blood pressure 
• ECG  
• Physical examination  
• Best-corrected visual acuity (ETDRS)  
• Biomicroscopy  
• Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_233392]  
• Conjunctival hyperemia grading 
• Intraocular pressure (Goldmann tonometry) 
• Pachymetry  
• Gonioscopy  
• Visual field testing (automated,  threshold)  
• Ophthalmoscopy (dilated)  
• Blood collection for pharmacokinetic assessments (at 
selected sites)  
• Clinical laboratories (hematology, clinical chemistry, 
pregnancy (if applicable), and urinalysis [UA])  
Statistical 
Considerations: Safety :  
Adverse events : With 20 subjects per group there is a 95% 
certainty that an event that is not observed would have a true incidence rate of no more than 15%.  
 
H-1337  Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -201  Page 11 
 CONFIDENTIAL   Hyperemia:   Scored on a 5 -point scale from 0 to 3 (including 
0.5).  Assume the SD is 20% of the scale ran ge or 1 unit.  Then , 
with n = 20/group there is  86% power to detect a mean 
difference of 1 unit between pairs of groups ([ADDRESS_974575], alpha=0.05).  If a response is defined as a hyperemia 
score ≥ 3 and the response rate in the control group is 10%, 
then with n = 20/ group there is 85% power to detect a 
difference in response rates of 46% (Fisher’s exact test) . 
 In general, with 20 subjects per group there is 86% power to detect an effect size of 1.0 . 
 Null hypothesis :  The sample size is driven by [CONTACT_715496] H -1337.  The study is designed to test 
whether one or more concentrations of H-1337 are superior to the vehicle control in the reduction of IOP.  With n = 20/group this stage is powered at 94% to detect a difference in IOP 
reduction of 4.[ADDRESS_974576] deviation of 3.5 mmHg ([ADDRESS_974577], alpha=0.05). 
 The primary efficacy measure will be the mean change in IOP from Baseline ( Day 0) IOP (mmHg ) for each group on Days 14 
and 28 at each matched time point.  IOP will be measured as 
indicated in the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures Table.  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include: (1) the observed IOP, mean change and percent change from Baseline IOP at 
each matched time point at each visit and (2) the mean observed, mean change from Baseline and mean percent change from Baseline for the mean diurnal IOP at each visit, and (3) the proportion of subjects reaching a target IOP (< 18 
mmHg) at e ach time point and with the mean diurnal IOP for 
each visit.  Each concentration will be compared to vehicle and 
the difference in means between treatment arms will be 
presented.

 CONFIDENTIAL   1 BACKGROUND  
Glaucoma is a slowly progressive optic neuropathy characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion 
cells (RGC) and optic nerve axons resulting in vision loss.  Glaucoma is generally 
asymptomatic until advanced irreversible disease has occurred.  It is estimated th at close to 
[ADDRESS_974590] glaucoma, 50% of whom are undiagnosed, and approximately 120,000 individuals are blind from glaucoma  (Prevent Blindness America 
www. preventblindness.org; National Eye Health Program/National Institutes of Health 
www.nei. nih.gov).   
Current treatments for glaucoma aim to reduce IOP, which has been shown to slow visual 
field loss in clinical trials  (Musch et al., 2011).  Intraocular pressure ( IOP) is the only 
modifiable risk factor, and current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_715475].  Drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , classified by 
[CONTACT_160469] (MOA), include: beta -blockers, prostaglandin analogues, alpha-2 
selective agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sympathomimetics, miotics and hyperosmotic agents ( Vetrugno, et al.,2008).   Prostaglandins are now the most prescribed 
first-line agents to treat glaucoma worldwide and are used as a monotherapy and/or in 
conjunction with beta- blocker class  agents (i.e., timolol).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_715476], 30% of subject s still progress and lose vision and m any subjects require multiple 
medications.  
An area of unmet need in glaucoma is for effective agents that act through new mechanisms , 
particularly those that can promote outflow through the trabecular meshwork.  While there 
are many classes of IOP -lowering drugs approved, no class acts to directly increase the 
conventional TM outflow other than pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227].  An IOP -lowering agent that could increase 
conventional TM outflow and  be used as monotherapy or in combination with current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_715477].  
H-1337 is a selective multi-kinase inhibitor, and the proposed mechanism of action of the 
compound is hypothesized to involve inhibition of kinases that play a role in controlling intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics  and contractility .  While the r egulation of intraocular 
pressure by [CONTACT_358490] (trabecular) outflow pathway is complicated, extracellular 
matrix expression and trabecular meshwork cytoskeletal shape and contractility appear  to be 
important to control outflow resistance.  
The IC
50 values of kinases strongly inhibited by H-1337 include 7 kinases with values less 
than 0.1 µ mol/L.  Among the kinases that are potently inhibited by H-1337, LRRK2, PKA 
and PKD1 are kinases that are known to be involved in the modulation of intracellular cytoskeletal dynamics.   It has been hypothesized that drugs that modulate the intracellular 
cytoskeleton of cells within the trabecular meshwork may beneficially affect aqueous outflow dynamics.  This has been considere d the primary mechanism of ROCK inhibitors 
(Rao & Epstein, 2007).   LRRK2 has been shown to affect actin polymerization in vitro  and 
there is evidence for an association of LRRK2 with tubulin/actin, thus suggesting that cellular morphological changes may be consequences of LRRK2-modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics (Meixner, 2011, Gandhi, 2009).   PKA phosphorylates many cytoskeletal proteins, 
including microtubules, intermediate filaments and actin and affects cell morphology  and

crucial modulator of actin dynamics  (Nadella, 2009).  Studies have also suggested an 
involvement of PKD1 in the regulation of cell shape, motility and adhesion, and 
phosphorylation of downstream substrates by [CONTACT_715497]1 leads to altered cofilin activity and actin re-organization ( Eiseler, et al, 2009).   Finally, while H-[ADDRESS_974591] ( Stamer & Acott, 2012).  
In general, the most frequent adverse event seen with topi[INVESTIGATOR_715478] H1337 administration is associated with transient

1.2 Preclinical Data  
To support the topi[INVESTIGATOR_391746] H-1337 in humans, a series of nonclinical 
toxicology and safety pharmacology studies with topi[INVESTIGATOR_715480] H-1337 were conducted.  These studies included GLP 4-week studies in rabbit and monkey using the topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/ocular mode of administration which evaluated the potential H-1337 to cause toxicity to the eye and surrounding ocular tissues as well as the potential for H-1337 to cause systemic toxicity.  To more comprehensively characterize the systemic safety profile of H -
1337 in the event of significant absorption from the ocular into the systemic or non- ocular peripheral tissue compartments, a comprehensive series of studies were conducted utilizing parenteral or oral routes of administration.  The core battery of safety pharmacology studies included a neuropharmacology study and a pulmonary function study in rats as well as a cardiovascular study in conscious telemetered monkeys.   
Overall, the concern for potential adverse effects is largely  mitigated by [CONTACT_715498]/concentrations to be administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_897] . 
The effects defined in nonclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology studies conducted 
with H-[ADDRESS_974594] topi[INVESTIGATOR_391746] H -1337, systemic effects are considered 
unlikely following topi[INVESTIGATOR_715481].

please see the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.4 Dose Rationale   
Ocular PK data in rabbits and monkeys confirm ed that H-1337 exhibits dose- related effects 
and can reduce IOP for upwards of 8-12 hours.  The clinical doses , treatment period 
(28 days), and dosing regimen (BID) that  are expected to have an acceptable safety profile 
have been selected based on preclinical toxicology data.  The total daily administered dose of 
H-1337 in human subjects will be approximately 1 mg (or 0.014 mg/kg/day, calculated assuming a 70-kg subj ect) when administered twice daily in both eyes at the maximal 
concentration of 0.6%.

3.4 Trial Treatment  
Subjects will receive one of four dosing arms: H-1337 at concentrations of 0.06%, 0.2%, or 0.6%, or a control vehicle.  IP will be administered BID unilaterally in the study eye for the first [ADDRESS_974601] IP bottle will be dispensed on Day 0 (Baseline) and the second IP bottle will be dispensed to the subject on Day 14.  The third IP bottl e will serve as a back -up if the subject needs a 
replacement IP bottle.   
3.[ADDRESS_974602]’s participation will consist of two phases:  a screening phase (Screening and 
Baseline Visits) where subject s will wash  out any current ocular hypotensive therapy  and a 
dosing phase, starting on Day 0.  If a subject is not on ocular hypotensive therapy, there is no applicable washout period and the Baseline Visit should occur after clearance of clinical laboratories.   
A subject could participate in the study for a total of up to approximately 11 weeks.  Subjects 
who meet the applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit will discontinue 
use of any current ocular hypotensive therapy during the washout period.  The washout 
duration will be dependent on the subject’s pre-study ocular hypotensive therapy.  The table 
below lists the applicable washout durations for various pre-study ocular hypotensive medications.  (Note: This table may not be inclusive of all ocular hypotensive medications.  The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_715500].) If the Investigator assesses an acceptable risk, subjects may extend washout up to 49 days to accommodate scheduling.

 CONFIDENTIAL   Following the applicable washout period, the subjec t will return for applicable 
inclusion/exclusion evaluations on the Baseline Visit ( Day 0).  On Day 0, a subject meeting 
all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to  IP.  On Days 0 to 3, only the study eye 
will be dosed and evaluated for safety.  For the remainder of treatment, both eyes will be 
dosed and evaluated for safety.  The study eye is the eye that meets th e entry IOP criteria 
after washout.  Should both eyes meet the criteria then the study eye will be defined as the eye with the higher 8 am IOP on Baseline ( Day 0).  If both eyes have the same 8 am IOP on 
Baseline ( Day 0), the study eye will be the right eye.  
Dosing will be initiated in the study eye on Day [ADDRESS_974603] wi ll be dosed for up to 28 days during which time they 
will be monitored for safety, tolerability, and efficacy assessments according to the Schedule of Study Assessments and Procedures.  
The duration of participation for subjects in each stage will be as follows:  Screening Visit: 1 day 
Washout Period: up to 6 weeks (+ 1 week ) depending on pre-study ocular hypotensive 
therapy 
Treatment Period: 28 days

4.[ADDRESS_974607] Withdrawal and/or Discontinuation  
Subjects are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time without prejudice 
to further treatment.  The investigator must withdraw any subject from the study at their 
request.  Subjects should provide the reason for withdrawal and confirm whether they are 
withdrawing consent or withdrawing from IP treatment and will continue to participate in the 
study.  The investigator or Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,  may withdraw the subject from IP 
treatment for any reason or if the subject  meets any of the following  criteria. 
 
• Experiences a serious or intolerable AE  that is judged by [CONTACT_715503]. 
• Develops a clinically significant laboratory or ot her abnormality  that is judged by [CONTACT_358498].  
• Requires a medication that is prohibited by [CONTACT_760].  Contact [CONTACT_715504] a subject due to use of a prohibited medication before exiting the subject. 
• Does not follow the protocol procedures, including noncompliance. 
• Is lost to follow -up; every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_423].  
• Administrative reasons , including termination of the trial by [CONTACT_1034], unavailable for 
follow-up procedures.

 CONFIDENTIAL   • Experiences glaucomatous progression and/ or unacceptable IOP elevation , per the 
discretion of the investigator. 
 
Should a subject’s medical or mental condition change or become unstable during the study, 
such that the ability of the subject to continue in this study becomes compromised or, in the investigator’s judgment, their health is jeopardized, or further continuation is unadvisable, the subject may be withdrawn from study treatment and/or withdrawn from the study.  
If a subject prematurely withd raws from the study, either at her/his request or at the  
discretion of the investigator or Allysta Pharmaceuticals , Inc. the reason for withdrawal 
should be recorded.  All subjects prematurely discontinuing study dosing, regardless of 
cause, will return wi thin [ADDRESS_974608] dose of IP to complete Early Termination 
visit assessments; consult the Medical Monitor to determine which diurnal measurements, if any, are required for the ET visit.  Study subjects who withdraw from the study may be 
replaced at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
It is vital to obtain follow-up data for any subject  withdrawn due to an AE or abnormal 
laboratory test.  In any case, every effort must be made to undertake safety follow-up 
procedures. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560].  If every effort is made to contact [CONTACT_423]  (including two telephone calls and a 
traceable letter sent to the subject) and these attempts are unsuccessful, the subject  is 
considered lost to follow-up. 4.4 Medication  
During the wash out period from prior IOP -lowering monotherapy, topi[INVESTIGATOR_715485] (CAI) ( i.e., Dorzolamide (Trusopt®) or Brinzolamide  (Azopt®) will be 
permitted , but will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  Should a topi[INVESTIGATOR_358474], the applicable washout for CAIs should be implemented and the 
CAI should be discontinued 5 days prior to Baseline (Day 0). 
Current systemic mediation s which may influence intraocular pressure should be stable and 
not expected to change over the course of the trial.   Should a subject’s medical condition 
change or become unstable during the study, such that the change in non- ocular medication 
that can or may affect IOP are added or  altered (i.e., steroids, systemic beta blockers, etc.), 
the subject’s condition should be reviewed with the Medical Monitor prior to possible 
withdrawal from the study.  If the subject is withdrawn, the subject will continue to be followed until he/she re turns within [ADDRESS_974609] from study 
treatment and institute IOP treatment.

pressure should be recorded.  The same type of device and cuff must be used throughout the study on the same subject.  An appropriate cuff size with a bladder encircling at least 80% of the upper arm should be used to ensure accurate measurements. 
Blood pressure will be measured using the most ideal conditions as possible given the subject’s medical condition and age.  If possible, the same arm should be used throughout the study.  Blood pressure should be measured after sitting in a seated position for [ADDRESS_974612] should be in a seated 
and relaxed state.  An automated blood pressure unit may be used to measure the heart rate.

 CONFIDENTIAL   Electrocardiogram (ECG):  12-lead ECGs should be performed according to the site’s 
standard procedures.  ECG interpretation must be documented and reviewed by [CONTACT_715510]’s safe participation in this trial.  
Physical Examination:  T he following systems  should be examined: cardiopulmonary, 
endocrine, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal , rheumatic , neurologic, psychiatric, 
dermatologic, hepatic, renal, and head, ears, nose, and throat.  Other body systems may be 
deferred at the discretion of the investigator.  Abnormalities should be recorded in the medical history.  
Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (ETDRS) :  Visual acuity will be performed before 
implementing any procedure that can affect vision (i.e., pupil dilation, tonometry, and 
gonioscopy).  The most current refraction within [ADDRESS_974613] corrected visual acuity (BCVA) should be recorded using the ETDRS  
chart (or a modified ETDRS chart).  If a change in BCVA is noted, pi[INVESTIGATOR_715486], but a formal refraction prior to dilation should be performed during that visit and/or on the next visit.  The LogMAR scores will be calculated according to the standard scoring methodology. A change of ≥  10 letters may indicate an adverse event and 
should be investigated further by [CONTACT_715511].  
ETDRS Scoring Meth odology:  The best -corrected visual acuity will be measured using an 
ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart.  The test distance must be at 
the distance specified on the ETDRS chart.  
Position the ETDRS chart at the approximate eye level of an  average-height seated subject .  
Mark a spot on the floor ( e.g., with tape) that is the appropriate test distance from the ETDRS 
chart.  The test distance for the chart must be kept constant throughout the study. 
The subject  should be seated comfortably, directly  in front of the chart, so that the eyes 
remain at the appropriate distance as determined by [CONTACT_319753] .  Testing always begins 
with the right eye, followed by [CONTACT_358503].  The fellow eye should be occluded.   
Do not point to specific letters on the chart during the test.  Ask the subject  to read each letter 
slowly, line by [CONTACT_4548], left to right, beginning with Line [ADDRESS_974614] reads a number, remind him/her that the 
chart contains no numbers, and request a letter in lieu of the number.  The subject  should be 
told that only one chance is given to read each letter, but he/she may change his/her mind 
before moving to the next letter.   Do not allow the subject  to proceed to the next letter until 
he/she has given a finite answer.  If the subject is unsure about the identity of the letter, then 
the subject  should be encouraged to guess.  The subject  should be encouraged to continue 
reading even if making mistakes.  When a subject reaches a level where he/she cannot guess, 
the examiner may stop the test.

 CONFIDENTIAL   Conjunctival Hyperemia:  Hyperemia will be assessed and recorded separately from 
biomicroscopy through direct visual observation prior to fluorescein instillation and IOP 
measurement.  The hyperemia will be graded on a 0 to 3 scale using the photographic reference scale provided by [CONTACT_358504].

Intraocular P ressure:  All IOP measurements must be measured by [CONTACT_182521].  The tonometer calibration should be checked for accuracy within one month before screening the first subject for the study.  A Tonometer Calibration Form must be completed and filed before the first subject is screened and calibration must be checked monthly throughout the study.  Variation within ± [ADDRESS_974616] measurement will 
be taken and the median value will be used for analysis.  Mean IOP values should be rounded up to the next whole number if the value is equal to or greater than 0.5 mmHg, and rounded down if less than 0.5 mmHg ( e.g., 24.5 should be rounded to 25, 24.4 should be rounded to 
24).  The same procedure will be repeated on the contralateral eye.  
In order to minimize confounding variables, every effort should be made to measure all IOP measurements for each subject by [CONTACT_715512].  
Pachymetry:   Pachymetry will be performed OU at the Screening Visit; results obtained 
within the prior 6 months may be used if no change is suspected.  Central cor neal thickness 
(central zone) will be measured with a calibrated ultrasound pachymeter in both eyes after topi[INVESTIGATOR_715488].  Three measurements will be taken, first in the right eye, and the average will be recorded in micrometers (μm).  The subject will be in a seated position and fixating on a target straight ahead.  The same procedure is then performed on the left eye once the measurements have been completed in the right eye.  
Gonioscopy:  The gonioscopy examination will be performed OU at the Screening Visit; 
results obtained within the prior 6 months may be used if no change is suspected .  
Gonioscopy should be performed prior to instillation of dilating or miotic drops, with high magnification, and with dim illumination  to potentiate  visualization of the angle in its natural 
configuration.  The angular width of the angle recess will be graded as an average score representative of all 4 quadrants using the grading criteria below .

those with a) fixation losses le ss than or equal to 20%, b) false positives less than or equal to 
33% and c) false negatives less than or equal to 33%.  Visual fields are to be performed with a non-dilated pupil unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the pupil is so miotic that dilation is required (i.e., < 3 mm).  If the visual field examination was conducted using 
dilation at the Screening Visit, dilation should be used for any subsequent visual field 
examinations  (i.e., if performed at an unscheduled visit; visual field testing should be 
performed during the trial if glaucomatous progression is suspected).  Visual field interpretation must be documented and reviewed by [CONTACT_093], including an assessment of whether the results are normal or abnormal and the clinical significa nce of abnormalities.   
Dilated Ophthalmoscopy:  Posterior segment exam will be performed according to the 
investigator’s preferred procedure.  Magnification, lighting, and examiner should be 
consistent for each subject throughout the study.  Ophthalmoscopy should be performed after pupil dilation (i.e., 1% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_358480] 2.5% phenylephrine). The examination should include an evaluation of the vitreous, retina, macula, choroid, and optic nerve (including the absence or presence of notches and/or disc or peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_715489]).  Abnormalities and pathologic findings will be graded.  Ocular structures will be graded according to the following scale.

 CONFIDENTIAL   6 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
6.1 Efficacy Parameters  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints: 
The primary efficacy measure will be the mean change in IOP from Baseline (Day 0) IOP 
(mmHg) for each group on Days 14 and 28 at each  matched time point as compared to 
vehicle.  IOP will be measured according to the Schedule of Assessments and Procedures 
Table.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints :  
1. The observed IOP , mean change from Baseline,  and % change from Baseline IOP at each 
matched time point at each visit, and  
2. The mean observed, mean change from B aseline and mean % change from Baseline for 
the mean diur nal IOP at each visit, and  
3. The proportion of subjects reaching a target IOP (< 18 mmHg) at each time point and 
with the mean diurnal IOP for each visit.  Each concentration will be compared to vehicle 
and the difference in means between treatment arms will be presented.    
6.2 Method and Timing  
The efficacy parameter for this study is IOP as measured by [CONTACT_715514].  The timing of the IOP measurements are based on preclinical IOP data that was observed both in NHP and rabbits.  The time points of diurnal IOP 
measurements are based on the expected peak and trough of H -1337 efficacy, the timing and 
frequency of dosing of H-1337 during 24 hours, and the circadian IOP diurnal curve.  
H-1337  Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -[ADDRESS_974620] dose of IP (Day 0).  Ongoing AEs at early termination or study completion (Day 28) will 
be followed until the event resolves, stabilizes, or for [ADDRESS_974621].  
All adverse events (serious and non-serious) must be documented regardless of the causal relationship to the study medication .  The severity,  frequency, seriousness, duration, 
relationship to IP(s), treatment of event, action taken  with IP, and outcome for every adverse 
event should be documented in the source documents and CRFs. 
Non-clinically significant incremental < 2 grade changes  in conjunctival hyperemia 
(according to the photographic reference scale provided for the trial) are not required to be 
reported as adverse events.  
To capture the most potentially relevant safety information during a clinical study, it is important that investigators record accurate AE terms on CRFs.   Wherever possible, a 
specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_67442].  However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_1275], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF. 
Investigators are required to report to Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  or its representative all 
observed and/or volunteered AEs occurring during the clinical trial (21  CFR §312.64[b]) 
regardless of treatment group or suspected causality to the investigational drug. 7.[ADDRESS_974622] a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An AE can , therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with t he use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, must be 
recorded.  This definition also includes A Es which are reported up to [ADDRESS_974623]  
has completed a clinical study.  Therapeutic failures during clinical trials are not considered to be AEs. 
Examples of adverse events include, but are not limited to: 
• Abnormal test finding 
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs  
H-1337  Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -201  Page 43 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL   • Changes in physical examination findings 
• Hypersensitivity  
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease 
• Change in BCVA > 10 letters  
• Clinically significant change in pachymetry  
 
Additionally, they may include the signs and symptoms resulting from:  
• Drug overdose 
• Drug withdrawal  
• Drug abuse 
• Drug misuse  
• Drug interactions  
• Exposure in utero (i.e., pregnancy within 30 days of study completion) 
 7.[ADDRESS_974624] finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms  
 and/or 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
 and/or 
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy 
and/or 
• Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_715515], Inc.  
 
Reporting an abnormal test, in absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error or is felt to be not clinically significant (NCS) by [CONTACT_715516]. 
H-1337  Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -[ADDRESS_974625] visit should be recorded as 
an adverse event if the above criteria are met.  
7.4 Definitions  of Non -Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events that do not meet the definitions for serious adverse events ( SAEs) are non-
serious AEs.  Subject s should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the 
investigator.   
7.[ADDRESS_974626], or 
precaution.  This includes any experience that:  
• Results in death  
• Is acutely life -threatening  
• Requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50891] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
This definition includes concurrent illness or injuries, exacerbation of pre-existing conditions and AEs occurring as a result of drug withdrawal, abuse or overdose.  Serious a dverse events 
observed during all periods of a clinical study are to be recorded, including those occurring during a period without study medication and whether or not the AE is judged to be related to the study medication.  
7.6 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_715491].  Any initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility meets these criteria.  Admission also includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care facility.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]: 
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57714]

Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -201  Page 45 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL   • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (caregiver relief)  
• Skilled nursing facility  
• Nursing homes 
• Routine emergency admission  
• Same day surgeries  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_358486] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical adverse event (e.g., 
for work-up of persistent pre- treatment lab abnormality)  is not in itself a serious adverse 
event.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported 
as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as an adverse event and the resulting surgical intervention should be recorded as a treatment of that adverse event.  
7.[ADDRESS_974627] notify Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  or its representative immediately 
and within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence by [CONTACT_12550] a Pregnancy Report Form and forwarding to Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its representative.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  Any com plications during 
pregnancy should be recorded as an AE and may constitute an SAE if they fulfill any of the 
specified criteria for an SAE .  If upon outcome, the pregnancy meets one of the serious 
criteria (e.g. spontaneous miscarriage, congenital anomaly,  or birth defect), it will then be 
considered an SAE and full details will be requested.  These events will not be included in the clinical study report, but will be maintained in the clinical study files.   
7.8 Definition of Unexpected Adverse Events  
An AE is considered an unexpected AE if it is not mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB), or if it is of greater frequency and/or severity than that mentioned in the IB, in the 
judgment of the Medical Monitor. 
7.9 Definition of Relationship of Adverse Event to IP  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious).  The investigator must record the relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious AE reporting requirements, if 
H-1337  Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -201  Page 46 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL   applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to the adverse event.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined by [CONTACT_715494], Inc.  If the investigator’s causality assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product,” this should be clearly documented in study records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study 
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable.  The categories are as follows:  
0=Unrelated:  No temporal association, or the cause of the ev ent has been 
identified, or the drug, biological, or device cannot be implicated. 
 
1=Possibly Related:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the 
cause; however, involvement of the drug, biological, or device cannot be excluded. 
 
2=Probably Related:  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but unlikely.  
 
3=Definitely  Related: Temporal association and no other etiologies possible . 
 
 
7.10 Documentation of Severity of Adverse Events to IP  
All adverse events will be examined to determine severity.  The categories are as follows:  
Mild: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated.  Does 
not interfere with subject’s usual function.  
 
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual activity 
and may warrant intervention. 
 
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly 
affects clinical status, and warrants intervention.  
 
Life-threatening:  Immediate risk of death.

SAEs (this refers to any AE that meets one or more of the aforementioned serious criteria)  
occurring after the subject receives the first dose of IP (Day 0) will be reported to Allysta 
Pharmaceuticals or its representative, followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, the 
subject’s early termination or study completion (Day 28), or within [ADDRESS_974628].   
SAEs, and all deaths occurring within the study population, whether considered to be 
drug-related or not, will be reported on the SAE Report F orm within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the occurrence to Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its representative.  
This can be done by [CONTACT_110191] a completed SAE Report Form to: 
 
Name:   [CONTACT_358511]:   Drug Safety Specialist Consultant  
Company:  Safety Sphere, LLC  (www.safety -sphere.com ) 
Email:   aly337- 201sae@safety -sphere.com 
Office Phone:  [PHONE_7435] 
Office Fax:  [PHONE_7436] 
 Where the initial report is made verbally or by [CONTACT_715517], Inc. or 
the study monitor, the SAE Report Form must be emailed within [ADDRESS_974629].  All SAEs (initial and follow -up information) must be reported to 
the reviewing Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee , according  to their reporting 
requirements, and a copy of that report must be forwarded to Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its representative . Allysta Pharmaceuticals (or designee) will report all Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction s (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to Regulatory Authorities within 
7/[ADDRESS_974630]’s subsequent course until the SAE has subsided, or until the condition 
stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), the subject dies, or within [ADDRESS_974631].  SAEs that come to the attention of the investigator within  30 days following early 
termination or Day 28 will be reported to Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its representative 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the occurrence.   
H-1337  Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: ALY337 -[ADDRESS_974632] whether one or more concentrations of H-1337 are superior to the vehicle 
control in the reduction of IOP.  With n = 20/group this stage is powered at 94% to detect a difference in IOP reduction of 4.[ADDRESS_974633] deviation of 
3.5 mmHg ([ADDRESS_974634], alpha=0.05). 
Adverse events:  With 20 subjects per group there is  a 95% certain ty that an event that is not 
observed would have a true incidence rate of no more than 15%. 
Hyperemia:  Scored on a 5 -point scale from 0 to 3.  Assume the SD is 20% of the scale range 
or 1 unit.  Then , with n = 20/group there is  86% power to detect a mean difference of 1 unit 
between pairs of groups ([ADDRESS_974635], alpha=0.05) .  If a response is defined as a 
hyperemia score ≥ 3 and the response rate in the control group is 10%, then with n = 
20/group there is  85% power  to detect a difference in response rates of 46% (Fisher’s exact 
test). 
In general, with 20 subjects per group the re is 86% power to detect an effect size of 1.0. 
If a concentration is chosen that is less than the max imum, the safety data from the higher 
doses can be combined to increase power.  
8.2 Statistical Methods  
Continuous and ordinal measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values).  Qualitative measures will be tabulated by [CONTACT_33335].  Selected safety measures may be summarized by [CONTACT_715518].  Summary tables will show the data for each time point (visit and/ or time 
of day as appropriate) and will display the observed and change (and for IOP the % change) 
from baseline value.  
A statistical analysis plan will be prepared prior to unmasking the treatment assignments.  
An analysis of results will be conducted when the database for each stage has been locked 
and the treatment assignments have been revealed.  No within -stage interim analyses are 
planned. 
8.[ADDRESS_974636] Population(s) for Analysis  
Up to approximately [ADDRESS_974637] one dose will be evaluable for the safety analysis.  
For efficacy considerations, the primary analysis population will be the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
population.  All subjects who receive study medication and who complete at least one on-
therapy study visit will be evaluable for the ITT analyses.  Subjects who receive study

 CONFIDENTIAL   medication, satisfy pre -randomization inclusion/exclusion criteria, and who complete at least 
one on-therapy study visit will be evalua ble for a per protocol population analysis.  
Individual subject visits and data points that do not satisfy protocol criteria may be excluded 
from per protocol analyses.  Evaluability will be determined prior to breaking the code for  
masked treatment assignment.  
8.[ADDRESS_974638] with a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 will be used.   
8.5 Accountability Procedure  
It is expected that in this small trial of brief duration, the incidence of missing data will be 
kept to a minimum.  Sites, subjects and Allysta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or its representative will be trained in methods to encourage continued participation to maximize the completion rate and overall quality of the trial.  As this is a small Phase 1/2a exploratory trial, there are no plans to impute values for missing data.  With regard to the primary efficacy variable, IOP, there are steps taken in the procedure for collecting these data that minimize the likelihood of spurious data. 
8.6 Deviation Reporting 
Any deviations from the statistical plan enumerated in the protocol or final statistical plan 
will be described and justified in the clinical study report.

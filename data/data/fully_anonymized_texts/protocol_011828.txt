Title  Wearable  Vibration  Device  to Prevent  Bone  Loss  in Postmenopausal  Women– Aim 2 
Sponsor  Theranova,  LLC  
Device  Wearable  Vibration  Device  (WVD)  
Background  
and Rationale  An emerging  alternative  to pharmacological  interventions  for osteoporosis  is whole -body  
vibration  (WBV).  The wearable  vibration  device  (WVD)  aims  to consistently  deliver  vibrations  
directly  to the hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_878377].  We propose  that 
demonstrating  higher  rates  of compliance  and consistent  delivery  of optimal  force  with 
accelerome ter-based  force  feedback  will provide  a superior  alternative  to WBV  platforms  and is 
plausibly  more  effective  at preventing  bone  loss in postmenopausal  women  than vibration  
platforms  in the home  setting.  
Objectives.  To demonstrate  that postmenopausal  women  will:  
1. Tolerate  our device;  
2. Receive  consistently  therapeutic  levels  of vibration ; and  
3. See changes  in bone  turnover . 
Indications  for 
Use/Patient  
Population  The device  is to be worn  by [CONTACT_878381][INVESTIGATOR_878378]. Subjects  will be instructed  to wear  the device  30 minutes  while  
walking  or standing.  
Trial  Design  Single  center  prospective,  non-randomized,  unblinded,  Non-Significant  Risk (NSR)  trial.

Study  
Procedures  Screening  Period  (Ongoing)  
Potential  subjects  will answer  screening  questions  via phone  to determine  eligibility.  Women  
who qualify  based  on screening  criteria  will be scheduled  for a baseline  visit at the University  of 
Nebraska  Medical  Center .  Subjects  with low or normal  bone  mass  may be enrolled  in the 
study.  
 
Study  Period  (1-2 weeks)  
The two week  protocol  consists  of subjects:  1) visiting  the clinic  for a Wearable  Vibration  Device  
(WVD)  pack  fitting , wearing  the device  (motor  off) for [ADDRESS_1227195] activity  blood  draw,   2) visiting the clinic  at the end of week  one to 
measure  acceleration , wear  the device  (motor  on) for [ADDRESS_1227196] activity  blood draw.  
Safety  & Safety  
Monitoring  It is the responsibility  of the investigator  to report  when  an adverse  event  has occurred.   
Adverse  event  information  will be collected  throughout  the study . Adverse  Events  (both  
expected  and unexpected)  will be recorded and reported  appropriately.  
Inclusion  
Criteria  1. Female  
2. Last menstrual  period  at least  one year and not more  than six years.  
3. 19 years  of age and older . 
4. BMD  T-score at or above  -2.5 at the total hip and L1-L4 spi[INVESTIGATOR_878379]. 
5. Ambulatory  (can walk or stand  without  an assistive  device  for a minimum  of 30 minutes ). 
6. Able to understand  spoken  and written  English . 
7. Capable  and willing  to follow  all study -related  procedures .

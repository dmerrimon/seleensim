(TAU), relative to TAU plus access to a
 web-based chronic pain program (E-health+), in patients with chronic non-
cancer pain being treated with l ong-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] (LOT). It is hypothesized that the E-health+, relative to 
TAU, group will have a significantly greater proportion of participants with a: 1) ≥15% reduction in daily 
morphine equivalent dose (M ED) as assessed by [CONTACT_14578] (H 1: primary), and 2) clinically significant decrease 
(i.e. ≥ 2 points) in Pain Intensity score as measured by [CONTACT_7854] (H 2: key secondary) at [ADDRESS_237270]-treatment.  STUDY DESIGN.   This is a 10-month, intent-to-treat, 2- group randomized contro lled trial. Eligible 
participants will be rando mized to TAU or E-Health
+, stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 
at the end of the 4-month treatment  period, and at 6 months following en d-of-treatment th rough an electronic 
data capture system accessed by [CONTACT_47844]. Other outcome data will be obtained from the participant’s 
electronic health record (EHR).  STUDY POPULATION.   Approximately 400 participan ts, recruited from primary care and pain management 
practices within one of two healthca re systems (University of Cincinnati Health and Duke Health), will be 
randomized into the study. Each h ealthcare system will randomize approx imately 200 participants. The study 
population will include individual s who are 25-80 years of age,  being treated with LOT ( ≥3 months) for chronic 
pain with a MED ≥ [ADDRESS_237271] internet access.  
TREATMENTS.  Participants randomized to TAU will receive tr eatment for chronic pain as typi[INVESTIGATOR_198836]. Participants randomized to the E-health
+ arm will receive treatment as typi[INVESTIGATOR_198837] a 4-m onth subscription to an internet based ch ronic pain program (the Chronic Pain 
Management Program fr om Goalistics).  
ASSESSMENTS.  Data to calculate MED will be derived from th e participant’s EHR. The Brief Pain Inventory 
and other patient-reported assessments will be collected on-line using REDCap.   PRIMARY ANALYSIS.  The primary hypothesis is that a sign ificantly greater proportion of E-health
+, relative 
to TAU, participants will have a ≥15% decrease in MED between baselin e and 10-month (i.e., 6-month post-
treatment) follow-up. The MED outcome may be prone to si te effects in that the strategies used by [CONTACT_198899]; thus, the pr imary analysis will test 
for potential site (UC Health vs. Duke ) effects. Specifically, a logistic re gression will test for treatment (E-
health+ vs. TAU), site, and treatment-by-site  interaction effects, with treatme nt being the effect of interest.

 4.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
 
An estimated 100 million Americans suffer from chronic non-cancer pain  (referred  to as chronic pain ). The 
treatment of chronic non-cancer pain  has largely fallen to physicians w ho often, due to healthcare system 
constraints, rely exclusively on long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538] (LOT).1, [ADDRESS_237272] a prescription. 
This trend has been blamed for the rise in opi[INVESTIGATOR_198838].4 Nearly 46 Americans 
die from an overdose of prescr iption painkillers each day.5  A majority (60%) of the more than 15,000 annual 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595]/painkiller overdose deat hs in the U.S. occur in patients obtaining prescriptions within medical 
board prescribing guidelines.6 It has been estimated that opi[INVESTIGATOR_198839] e behaviors occur in 1 of every 4 patients 
receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_198840] 1 of every 10.7  Based on the adverse consequences 
of, and inadequate evidence of effectiveness for, LOT,  the CDC recently developed recommendations designed 
to decrease the use of LOT and the morphine eq uivalent dose (MED) for patients receiving LOT.8 However, the 
majority of people receiving LOT report that opi[INVESTIGATOR_198841];9-11 thus, these patients may be resistant to having their medication reduced or 
discontinued.9  This discrepancy between the goal of many policy makers and pr oviders to reduce or 
discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_198842] c pain treatment and the goal of pa tients to effectively manage their 
pain which, in their view, includes the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536], will likely result in poor outcomes should 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_198843], effective non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_198844]. Indeed, 
the importance of testing adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198845]’s new strategic plan.[ADDRESS_237273] few years, including by [CONTACT_120845]1 and National Institutes of Health.2 In order to be 
viable, the treatment needs to be accessible – both in te rms of availability and affo rdability – and effective. 
Unfortunately, many potential treatment al ternatives, including effective multidisciplinary or interprofessional 
treatments, are associated with significant barriers, including limited availability  in many areas, lack of 
coverage by [CONTACT_198900], limited patient acceptance, and other limitations.13-[ADDRESS_237274]. 
Based on concepts of self-efficacy, they aim to increas e a person’s confidence and ab ility to exert control over 
troubling health symptoms. Se lf-management programs have  been touted as an effective means to improve 
quality of life and health functioning while  reducing health care  resource utilization.16, [ADDRESS_237275] on reducing reliance on LOT,
23 with the exception of research on the 
Chronic Pain Management Program (re ferred to as E-health), which ha s been found to be efficacious in 
decreasing pain and medication use in two prior randomized controlled trials  (RCTs). Of critic al import, the E-
health intervention is particularly well-suited to a ddress the sometimes discrepa nt goals of policy makers/ 
providers to reduce LOT and of patients to manage thei r pain, which, for them, includes LOT. Specifically, two 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237276], conducted with a sample of chronic pain patients 
heterogeneous for LOT use (N=305), E-health partic ipants reported significantl y greater decreases in 
prescription medication use compar ed to a wait-list control group.[ADDRESS_237277] control, 
participants evidenced significantly gr eater decreases in opi[INVESTIGATOR_198846] d a significantly gr eater proportion of 
E-health participants reported  decreasing or discontinuing thei r opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] (21% vs. 7%).[ADDRESS_237278], conducted with 92 
people with chronic pain with a curr ent opi[INVESTIGATOR_198847] 18% of E-health participants, compared 
to 6% of wait-list cont rol, had a clinically significant decrease (i.e. ≥ 2 points) in Brief Pain Inventory Pain 
Intensity.[ADDRESS_237279] and with patients from primary 
care and pain management clinics, where the majority of chronic pain patients are treated. In addition to 
identifying an effective intervention, it is important to identi fy therapeutic mediators and moderators which 
would allow for tailored interventions and delineation of therapeutic target s; such evaluation for E-health has 
been suboptimal due to the constraints of the small sample size  of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (N=9 2) and, in the first RCT 
(N=305), only data on prescription me dication, rather than on opi[INVESTIGATOR_198848], being collected.   
  5.0 SPECIFIC AIMS  Aim 1: The primary aim is to evaluate the impact of treatment as usual rela tive to treatment as usual plus access 
to a web-based chronic pain program, the Chronic Pain Management Program (E-health+), on daily MED in 
patients with chronic non-cancer pain being treated with LOT. It is hypothesized that the E-health+, relative to 
TAU, group will have a significantly greater proportion of participants with a: 1) ≥15% reduction in daily 
morphine equivalent dose (M ED) as assessed by [CONTACT_14578] (H 1: primary), and 2) clinica lly significant decrease 
(i.e. ≥ 2 points) in Pain Intensity score as measured by [CONTACT_7854] (H 2: key secondary) at [ADDRESS_237280]-treatment.  Aim 2: Test our conceptual model of  E-health’s mechanisms of change, including hypothesized  mediators (i.e., 
pain self-efficacy, copi[INVESTIGATOR_198849], knowledge about pain/o pi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], and st ress) and moderators 
(neurocognitive function: executive function and verbal learning ability) of E-health’s imp act on decreasing 
MED and pain intensity. Moderated mediation analyses will be used to test our conceptual model.  
Our study will determine whether an innovative, accessible E- health intervention can assist with reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_198850], wh ich can, ultimately, reduce risks of un intended opi[INVESTIGATOR_198851]. 
Importantly, we will better understand the mechanisms  contributing to MED reduction while managing pain. 
Our findings may assist in developi[INVESTIGATOR_198852] a population at risk fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_198853].

 6.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
6.1 Overview of Study Design 
The study schema is provided in Figure 1 . This is a 10-month, intent-to-tr eat, 2-group randomized controlled 
trial. We will randomize 400 pa rticipants, recruited from primary care and pain management practices within 
one of two healthcare systems, in a 1:1 ratio to treat ment as usual (TAU) or E- health plus TAU (E-Health
+). 
Participants will be assessed at baseline, at the end of the 4-month treatment period, and at [ADDRESS_237281] practice at the particip ating sites will change during the course of the trial and, 
thus, an assessment of the clinics will be completed prior to the start of patient recr uitment and after the end of 
data collection (see Figure 1 ); this will provide more a ccurate information about the study sites and, thus, about 
the sites to which the results are most  likely to be generalizable. This is a particularly impor tant consideration 
for this trial in that recent years have seen a signifi cant increase in efforts to impro ve LOT prescribing practices. 
These include the CDC guidelines
8 and the recommendation by [CONTACT_198901].  
 
6.2 Number of Sites and Participants 
The two healthcare systems selected for this trial, Un iversity of Cincinnati (U C) Health and Duke, have 
successfully participated in primary care and chronic pa in research and have a su fficient pool of potential 
participants to support this trial. Each health system will randomize appr oximately 200 participants (for a total 
N=400), with a target rate of appr oximately 5.1/month for 39 months. 
 
6.3 Study Duration 
An individual participant’ s period of time for particip ation and study completion is  approximately [ADDRESS_237282]: 
 1. be 25-[ADDRESS_237283] a daily average prescribed MED ≥ [ADDRESS_237284] a chronic pain-related diagnosis  
 5. self-report current use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d medication(s) to treat pain 
 6. have a Brief Pain Inventory Pain Intensity score ≥[ADDRESS_237285] internet access and a working email account 
  
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237286] not: 
 1. be anyone who, in the judgment of st udy staff, would be unlikely to co mplete the study (e.g., planning to 
change to a different clinic for pain mana gement, have a termin al illness, etc.)  
 
2. be unwilling/unable to comple te the WebNeuro assessments 
 
3. be pregnant 
 
4. be a prisoner 
 
 
6.5 Outcome Measures 
 
6.5.1 Primary Outcome Measure  The primary outcome measure is whether (yes/no) there was a ≥15% decrease in MED, based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_198854]’s EHR, between baseline a nd 6-month post-treatment follow-up. 
There is no universally agreed upon me thod of calculating MED, which can re sult in inconsistent conversions 
among clinicians.
[ADDRESS_237287] definition for what constitutes a 
significant decrease in MED but a ≥15% decrease has been defined as a si gnificant change in past research.[ADDRESS_237288] of E-health on MED, as  a continuous measure, will be ev aluated in secondary analyses. 
 6.5.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  The secondary outcome measures are pr imarily self-report. Mobility can be an issue for individuals with 
chronic pain – to minimize pa rticipant burden, these data w ill be obtained through REDCap.
30 REDCap is a 
web-based software toolset and workfl ow methodology for co llection and management of clinical research data.  
 1. Pain Intensity The key secondary outcome is whether there is a clinica lly meaningful decrease (yes /no) in pain intensity ( ≥ 2 
points) as measured by [CONTACT_7854] (BPI)
[ADDRESS_237289]-treatment fo llow-up. The BPI [CONTACT_832] a well-
validated, reliable instrument that consists of a 4-item pain Intensity subscale and a 7-item pain interference subscale. The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_198855] 400 studies worldwide,
32 including the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (N=92) testing 
the efficacy of E-health for patients receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].25   
 2. Pain-related Sleep Problems The 3-item Sleep Problems Index will be  used to assess sleep interference re sulting from pain; this measure has 
been found to have good construct va lidity and reliability (Cronbach's α > 0.90).
33  
 3. Global Health Global Health, which is a quality of  life measure, will be assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 10-item  measure for Global H ealth, which briefly but 
comprehensively assesses physical, mental, and soci al health; this is a reliable (Cronbach's α > 0.80) measure 
with demonstrated construct validity.
34  
 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
13. 
 4. Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_198856] (COMM)
35, 36 will be used to assess opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]. The COMM is a 17-
item self-assessment used to monito r patients on opi[INVESTIGATOR_198857]. The COMM has good predictive va lidity and reliabi lity (Cronbach's 
α > 0.82).35, [ADDRESS_237290] University Patient Education Research Center Health Care Utilization survey will be used to track  
health care utilization;  the instrument has good test-ret est reliability; validity has been established through chart 
audits.
38   
 6.5.3 Moderators and Mediators Our conceptual model of E-health’s m echanisms of change  is described in section 8.1 . The moderator and 
mediator measures ar e delineated below. 
  [IP_ADDRESS] Neurocognitive Moderators Obtaining the data for our hypothesized neurocognitive moderators (see Figure 2 ) requires a web-based 
neurocognitive assessment. WebNeuro , which is the most widely used and validated web-based neurocognitive 
assessment,39, 40 will be used for this purpose. WebNeuro, whic h takes 30 minutes to complete, assesses several 
functional domains including sensorimotor, attention, executive function, memory, and social cognition and 
also provides a measure of intelligence. WebNeuro re ports raw scores and norma tive scores appropriately 
adjusted for the respondent’s age, gender, and edu cation. While WebNeuro include s a number of tests in 
addition to our moderators (Trail Making B and Delayed Ve rbal Recall), we selected it for use in this trial 
because it is the only web-based, vali dated neurocognitive assessment that included these desired tests. The 
additional WebNeuro tests may be used in  exploratory analyses to generate hypotheses to be tested in future 
research. For example, impulsivity has been found to be predictive of opi[INVESTIGATOR_198858].41 We would attempt to replicate this findi ng by [CONTACT_198902]’s Go-no- go test, a measure of impulsivity.40 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Mediators 
Each of the following measures wi ll be evaluated as mediators of E-health’s treatment effect (see Fig. 2 ). 
 1. Pain Knowledge Questionnaire 
A prior RCT of E-health found that  it significantly increased knowledge  about chronic pain and pain 
management.
26 The Pain Knowledge Questionnaire includes qu estions about opi[INVESTIGATOR_198859]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_198860].   2. Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) 
The Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) is a 10-item measure that has good construct validity and 
reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.92).
42  Higher self-efficacy is associated wi th positive outcomes for pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
increased pain thresholds and tolerance,43 decreased fear of movement, emotional distress, depressive 
symptoms, and disability.44, 45  
 3. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_100779] (CSQ-R) 
This 27-item Likert-scale questionnaire  assesses the use of si x pain-copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]: 1) catastrophizing; 2) 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497]-statements; 3) ignor ing sensation; 4) dist ancing; 5) distraction;  and 6) praying. Participants rate their 
utilization of each strategy on a 7-po int scale (0-“Never do that” to 6-“Always do that”). The CSQ-R has been 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237291] adequate internal consistenc y and validity in seve ral patient populations.
46-49 The moderator to be 
tested in the proposed study is the use of passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], calc ulated by [CONTACT_198903].50  
 4. Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21).  
This 21-item Likert-scale questionnaire  has established validity and reliabil ity and assesses three constructs: 1) 
depression; 2) anxi ety; and 3) stress.
51-[ADDRESS_237292]-week ra tings using a 4-point scale (0-“Did 
not apply to me at all” to  3-“Applied to me very much  or most of the time”). 
 6.5.4 Safety Measures   1. Adverse Events (AEs) 
An adverse event (AE) for this trial testing a low risk, internet-based, intervention is defined as > 30% symptom 
deterioration from baseline as indicated by [CONTACT_39132]: 
 Pain Intensity Score as measured  by [CONTACT_7854] 
 Pain Interference Score as measur ed by [CONTACT_7854] 
 The Depression score from the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DA SS-21), and higher than 
Normal/Mild range 
 The Anxiety score from the DASS-21, and higher th an Normal/Mild range 
 The Stress score from the DASS-21, a nd higher than Normal/Mild range 
Within REDCap, a report identifying participants with  potential AEs (i.e., > 30% worsening on the measures 
listed above relative to baseline) will be generated on a weekly basis at minimum.  
  6.5.5 Other Measures   [IP_ADDRESS] Participant Measures  1. Demographics 
This assessment will include questions about the participant’s ra ce/ethnicity, sex, marita l status, education, and 
employment status.  2. Pain-related Diagnoses  
Pain-related clinical characteristics will be assessed through both the participant’s EHR data (e.g., pain 
diagnoses, co-occurring diagnos es) and through self-report.  
 3. Pain-related Treatment  
Information about the TAU that the pa rticipant receives (physici an visits, referrals for other treatments, etc.) 
will be assessed with the particip ant’s EHR and through self-report. The self-report assessment will include 
questions about LOT, referrals recei ved for nonpharmacologic treatment, and types of pain treatment utilized. 
4.  E-health program adherence 
E-health program completion will be meas ured as a continuous variable by [CONTACT_3433] e presence of “star ratings,” which 
are required when participants exit a l earning activity in the E-health program.   Consistent with scoring used in

 a pi[INVESTIGATOR_198861] E-health program,
25 an engagement level of “0” will be assigned if the pre-requisite 
activity in the initial “Understanding Pain” Learning Center  was not completed; a “1” will be assigned if only 
the pre-requisite activity in the “Understanding Pain” module was completed; a “2 ” will be assigned if the 
Profile of Chronic Pain asse ssment is also completed, but  there was no evidence of activity within any of the 4 
other Learning Centers; a “3” will be assigned if activities were comple ted in [ADDRESS_237293] level of “6” assigned if th e participant has completed activities in all 4 other 
Learning Centers.      
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Practice Measures 
TAU at the participating practices will be characterized using three assessments, which will be completed by [CONTACT_198904]. An atte mpt will be made to have the same person complete 
the assessments at the pre-recruitment and post-data collection assessment time points; individuals will be compensated between $50 and $100 for completi ng these assessments at each time point. 
 1. Clinical Practice Characteristics 
A questionnaire will be used to obtai n information about the ge neral characteristics of ea ch practice, including 
size (e.g., number of full-time equivale nt providers, staff, patients), geographic location, and provider types 
(e.g., family medicine, internal medi cine, nurse practitioners, etc.). 
 
2. Practice-level Payer Data 
A questionnaire will be used to obtain informat ion about the payer type s for each practice. 
 
3. Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC) 
A modified version of the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (ACIC, version 3.5),
54 will be used to assess the 
practice’s approach to treating chroni c pain. The ACIC assesses six elements  that encourage high-quality care 
as outlined in the Chronic Care Model.55 The ACIC version 3.5 assesses: 1) health care organization (i.e., the 
degree to which the system focuses on chronic illness care); 2) community linkages (i.e., the degree to which 
linkages between the system and comm unity resources have been establ ished); 3) self-management support 
(i.e., the degree to which self-managem ent by [CONTACT_198905] a nd supported); 4) decision support (i.e., 
the degree to which providers have access to evidence- based information); 5) delivery system design (this 
includes multiple aspects of the system including patient  follow-up, encouraging a team-based approach etc.); 
and 6) clinical informati on systems (the degree to which providers and staff have timely information about 
individual patients and patient populations). In additi on, the degree to which there is integration of these 
elements is assessed. The ACIC has been utilized in a number of quality improveme nt projects and has been 
shown to have adequate reliability and validity.56, 57 
 
6.6 Randomization Plan 
Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TAU or to TAU plus E-health (E-health+). 
Randomization will be at the level of participants and  stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. The numbe r in each treatment group 
will never differ by [CONTACT_726] a factor of b/2 where b is the block size, which will help ensure treatment 
balance. The randomization process will be performed wi thin REDCap and the randomization sequence will be 
unknown to the res earch staff. 
  
6.7 Study Treatments 
 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
16. 
 6.7.1 Treatment as usual (TAU) 
TAU will primarily consist of LOT.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], physician visits, a nd referrals to non-pharmacological 
treatments (e.g., physical therapy, behavi oral therapy, etc.) will be tracked through the EH R. Participant self-
report will also be used to assess whether the patient received referrals  for nonpharmacologic treatment and the 
type of nonpharmacologic treatment(s) received. In addition, TAU will be ch aracterized using three assessments 
(i.e., the ACIC and questionnaires ab out the general characteristics a nd payer types of the practice -see section 
[IP_ADDRESS] ), which will be completed by [CONTACT_198906].  
 6.7.2 E-Health  
The E-health intervention is described in section 8. Participants randomized to the E-Health
+ condition will 
receive a free, 4-month subscription to the on-line Goalistics Chronic Pain Management Program. E-health+ 
participants will receive e- mails outlining what activities they shoul d be completing within the Chronic Pain 
Management Program during the cour se of their 4-month subscription and follow-up communications in the 
event of non-adherence.  7.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1 Study Overview 
Table 1 provides an overview of the pa rticipant procedures and assessments. 
 
7.2 Participant 
Recruitment and 
Consent 
Potential participants 
will be identified through EHR queries. Our primary form of recruitment will be letters, which has been found to be an effective method of recruitment for trials testing online interventions in other conditions (e.g., obesity, etc.).
58 The 
recruitment letters will use an “opt-out” strategy in which patients are asked to contact [CONTACT_198907]. An RCT comparing opt-out and opt-in (i.e., patient needs to Table 1. Participant Procedures and Assessments

rate and a more representative patient sample.
59 The opt-out strategy shows c onsideration for the patients’ 
autonomy because it gives them ready access to more info rmation about the study while also giving them the 
option to opt-out, whichever they decide.60 Practice Facilitators (PFs) will en sure that identified potential 
participants are sent a recruitment le tter and a study brochure. For patien ts not opting out, the PF will contact 
[CONTACT_198908] a phone pr e-screen. Patients who do not opt out, 
but who are not reached by [CONTACT_198909]. If the patient passes phone pre-
screen, they are sent an email directin g them to a secure website for inform ed consent. Patients will be given the 
opportunity to discuss any questions or concerns with study staff prior to electronically signing the consent 
form. Patients who are interested in participating will sign the electronic consent form (e.g., using a mouse or 
touch screen). The time and date of signature [CONTACT_198937] [CONTACT_198910]. When a participant has 
signed the electronic consent, a secure e-mail notification wi ll be automatically sent to research staff. Research 
staff will review the signed consent before sending an email with a link to th e study screening assessments. 
Participants will be mailed a hard copy of their signed consent. Non-PHI information from all pre-screening 
interviews is retained to help track recruitment effort s and reasons for ineligibilit y. For individuals who do not 
qualify for the study, the other data  collected during the pre-screeni ng interview will be destroyed. 
 
7.3 Screening/Baseline 
After signing the informed consent form, the study particip ant will be sent an e-mail directing them to a website 
to complete the screening/baseline assessments. Part icipants who are potentially eligible based on the 
screening/baseline assessments will be sent an e-mail with a link for th e web-based neurocognitive assessment 
(WebNeuro). Participants who meet study eligibility and complete screening/ba seline (including WebNeuro) 
will be randomly assigned to the TAU or E-health+ condition. In some circumstances, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_198862]. 
 
7.4 Active Treatment Phase 
The active treatment phase is comprised of the 4 months during which E-health+ participants are provided with 
a free subscription to the Chr onic Pain Management Program. 
 
7.5 Follow-up  
Because the primary outcome in  this trial (MED calculated from opi[INVESTIGATOR_198863]) is contained in the site’s 
EHR, it is not dependent on participant retention in th e study. Thus, primary outcome  data will be complete 
unless the participant withdraws cons ent or is no longer being treated at  the clinical site. The secondary 
outcomes for this trial (i.e., online surveys at months 4 and 10), however, will primarily be patient-reported 
outcomes. The present trial wi ll utilize multiple strategies  to help ensure a high ra te of completion. A recent 
systematic review of methods for re taining participants for follow-up in healthcare res earch found that studies 
using multiple retention strategies had significantl y higher retention rates.61 Accordingly, our retention plan 
includes several strategies identified by [CONTACT_198911]-analyses to be associated with 
questionnaire completion in general research,62 healthcare research and randomized controlled trials,62-64 and 
trials of online interventions.63 The retention strategies we will use incl ude: 1) financial incentives conditional 
on survey completion;63, 65 2) minimal participant burden (i.e., onlin e short-form assessments that can be 
completed at the participant’s convenience over a 28-day period);62, 64 3) an established schedule of data 
collection windows provided to particip ants at the time of randomization;62 and 4) a retention “escalation plan”, 
which includes automated email reminders with links to complete surveys.62, 64 Each of the follow-up time-
points (4- and 10-months pos t-randomization) will have a 28-day data  collection window during which the 
assessments can be completed. When the window begins , the participant will recei ve the initial assessment

 invitation link via email. If the partic ipant does not respond to the initial invitation, th en the participant will 
receive up to 5 additional reminders, using a mix of em ails, phone calls, and text me ssages, throughout the data 
collection window until it is completed. If a particip ant fails to respond to the 4-month follow-up survey within 
the allotted 28 days, then the participant will be sent  a personalized retention letter via Certified Mail, 
approximately one week prior to the opening of the 10-month time-point’s data collection window.

 8.0 CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEM ENT PROGRAM (CPMP) 
 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237296] funded by [CONTACT_198912] 
(NINDS), a prototype for the pain program was developed, reviewed, a nd twice revised. The second NINDS-
funded project included the final development of the program and an RCT to test its efficacy.
26 The E-health 
program includes five learni ng centers - the order in which they are completed is customized for each user 
based on priorities identif ied from completing the Pr ofile of Chronic Pain.66  Table 3  provides an overview of 
the content and therapeutic approach for each learning cen ter. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_198864] a 
patient’s life requires practice and pe rsistence on the part of the patient and the E-health intervention was 
designed to promote both. A set of self -management tools are integrated in to the learning centers to enhance 
tracking, troubleshooting, and at tainment of program activities and goals; examples of these E-health tools are 
provided in Table [ADDRESS_237297] dysfunctional thinking. Users create a custom plan to decrease self-defeating thoughts while increasing effective thinking.  
2. Feeling Better-  Provides training in fundamental methods of emotion regulation, 
including identifying negative and positive emotional triggers, the role of relaxation 
training in emotion regulation, and incorporati ng positive emotional triggers into daily life. 
A set of relaxation sessions offer practice in using breathing as a trigger for relaxation, 
progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and mindfulness meditation.  
3. Doing More- The primary goals are to increase activity and exercise and promote goal-
based activities. This learning center is based  on behavioral and motivational models of 
pain self-management.  
4.  Relating Better-  This is derived from interpers onal/transactional models of pain 
management. The user learns about types of  social support and how to differentiate 
effective versus ineffective support. A personalized support plan is created.  
5. Understanding Pain- This learning center teaches basic concepts underlying the 
biopsychosocial perspective on chr onic pain and its management. It consists of a series of 
videos covering such topi[INVESTIGATOR_198865], the safe use of pain medication, 
reducing reliance on pain medication, relaxati on, cognitive behavior therapy, biomedical 
treatment options, and hypnosis.

8.2 Conceptual Model of E-health’s Mechanisms of Change 
Evaluation of potential moderato rs and mediators of E-health’s effect on opi[INVESTIGATOR_198866] (N=92) and, in the 
first RCT (N=305), only data on prescr iption medication, rather than on op ioid medication specifically, being 
collected. Thus, in addition to testin g E-health’s effectiven ess, the proposed trial will make an important 
contribution by [CONTACT_198913] a model of E-health’s mechanisms of change (see Fig. 2) .  
 8.2.1 Hypothesized mediators  1) Knowledge about 
chronic pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_198867] E-health.
26 Knowledge 
about chronic 
pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_198868], to our knowledge, been evaluated as a mediator of MED 
reduction; however, based on patient feedback, the info rmation provided by E-health , particularly about the 
risks associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], decrease s the perceived desirability of LOT.  
Table 4. E-health tools to promote and track lifestyle changes 
Navigator Calendar:  Allows the user to schedule program activities a nd goals and send email and text-message reminders, 
with the ultimate goal that they will become automatic and self-sustaining.  
Self-Monitoring Tool:  Allows the user to select a self-monitoring exer cise (e.g., monitoring positive emotions), schedule 
it on the calendar, and send automated email or text alerts throughout the day.  
Pacing Tool: Used to create a custom plan to safely and slowly in crease an activity over time. The user selects an activity 
to be paced (e.g., walking, swimming, med itating, etc.), identifies the amount of ti me it can be comfortably completed, and 
sets a target goal. The system creates a plan that increases the duration of the ac tivity by 10% each week until the target 
time is reached. 
Daily Check-In:  Assists the user in tracking progress over time. This is  also linked to a separate set of program features: 
Mood Boosters, Pain Soothers , and  Activity Boosters . These tools allow the user to creat e a set of activities or experiences 
to boost mood, decrease pain, and increase activity. These are brief and easy-to-implement. Low mood, pain management, 
or activity ratings over several days triggers a reminder to schedule a Mood Booster, Pain Soother, or Activity Booster. 
Self-Reward tool:  Allows the patient to create a personalized list of inexpensive, easy-to-implement rewards to self-
administer for progress and completing activities. 
My Progress : Daily entries about what helps and interferes with ac tivity completion are displayed, and compared to those 
of other program users to help the user understand his/her pr ogress and to troubleshoot lack of progress. The system also 
displays progress in terms of Activity Completion Rate (the percentage of times that the user completed a scheduled 
activity). Each week, if the overall comp letion rate is reasonably high (e.g., ≥75%), a congratulatory message will be sent 
along with the suggestion that the user select a reward from his/her Self-Reward Menu.

 2) Pain self-efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_198914]-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), is significantly increased by 
E-health,25 and associated with positive outcomes including pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007],44 increased pain thresholds and 
tolerance,43 and decreased fear of movement and disability.44, 45 In addition, in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] E-health, PSEQ 
scores following treatment were positively associated with reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_96185] (r=.46, p=.03).67  
 3) Passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]. E-heal th significantly decreases pain cata strophizing, which is a passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_198869].[ADDRESS_237298]-surgery.50  
 4) Stress. E-health significantly de creases stress, depression, and anxi ety as measured by [CONTACT_198915], 
Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS) measure.26 A recent study testing an on-line chronic pain program in patients 
with back, neuropathic, and/or  arthritis chronic pain found that the stress scale of th e DASS mediated the effects 
of the intervention.[ADDRESS_237299] been found despi[INVESTIGATOR_198870].
68  In their review of the literature, Day et al68 noted that neurocognitive function 
may be an important moderato r of psychosocial pain interv entions but that it had yet to be evaluated. Similarly, 
Solberg et al.69  hypothesized that a chronic pain patient’s abi lity to self-regulate thought s and emotions and to 
engage in active copi[INVESTIGATOR_198871], in part, on ex ecutive functioning; the author s further hypothesized that 
psychosocial interventions could fail  in patients with insufficient executive functioning/self-regulation 
capacity.[ADDRESS_237300] B (T MT-B; Cohen’s d =-.38), a measure of executive functioning, and Delayed 
Verbal Recall (Cohen’s d=-.57), a  measure of verbal learning.[ADDRESS_237301]-surgery; TMT-B perfo rmance prior to surgery predicted the presence and 
intensity of chronic pain at 6- and 12-months post-surgery.[ADDRESS_237302] of medications used to  treat pain. Consistent with Solberg et al.’s69 hypothesized 
relationship between executive func tioning and ability to self-regulate,  this study also found that worse 
performance on the TMT-B was significantly associated with  the use of passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_198872] c pain intensity 12-months post-surgery.[ADDRESS_237303] less 
capacity to learn self-regulation strategi es from E-health (i.e., will moderate E-health’s effects), and hence, will 
evidence less improvement in pain self-efficacy, stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262]. Our findings will be useful for 
determining how treatment  options may need to be customized for individual abilities. 
 Another aspect of cognitive function that may moderate E- health’s treatment effect is the ability to learn new 
information. Verbal learning abilit y, as quantified by [CONTACT_198916], measures the respondent’s 
capacity to acquire, store, and retrieve verbal information.

 likely be for obtaining knowledge about chronic pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512]; to re duce the risk of a Type-I error we 
will test verbal learning as a moderator only for knowledge acquisition.  Finally, there is a dearth of  research evaluating the potential of MED as a moderator of treatment effect for 
chronic pain interventions. The participants in the pr esent study will likely be on a wide range of MED at 
baseline (e.g., eligibility criteria require a minimum of ≥ 20 mg/day and do not set an upper limit). Baseline 
MED as a potential moderator of E-health’s effects will be evaluated.  
 
 9.0 ANALYTICAL PLAN  
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
 
9.1.1 Primary Hypothesis  The primary hypothesis is th at a significantly greate r proportion of E-health
+, relative to TAU, participants will 
have a ≥15% decrease in MED between baseline and 10-m onth (i.e., 6-month post- treatment) follow-up.  
 9.1.2 Key Secondary Hypothesis The key secondary hypothesis is that a si gnificantly greater proportion of E-health
+, relative to TAU, 
participants will have a clini cally significant decrease (i.e. ≥ 2 points80) in Pain Intensity score at [ADDRESS_237306]-
treatment follow-up.  
9.2 Intent-to-Treat Participant Population 
The intent-to-treat population is defined as the pa rticipants who are ran domized to treatment.  
 
9.3 Analysis Plan 
Each primary and secondary efficacy outcome measure will be analyzed fo r the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. 
While there is every intention to be complete in descri bing the analyses to be perfo rmed, it is not possible to 
anticipate every contingency, and some adjustments may be required to meet constraints posed by [CONTACT_198917]. Constraints such as non- linearity, non-normality, etc. may lead  to different but more appropriate 
approaches to analysis. No in terim efficacy analyses or ad aptive features are planned. 
 
All statistical tests will be conducted at the 5% Type I error rate (two-s ided). When multiple  tests are conducted, 
the chance of finding a significant difference in one of the tests, when in fact no differe nce exists, is greater than 
the stated Type I error rate.  The investigators are aware of the multiple testing issu es and will interpret results 
with caution and use confidence intervals where possible.  9.3.1 Primary Outcome The primary hypothesis is th at a significantly greate r proportion of E-health
+, relative to TAU, participants will 
have a ≥15% decrease in MED between baseline and 10-mont h (i.e., 6-month post-treatment) follow-up. The 
MED outcome may be prone to site effe cts in that the strategies used by [CONTACT_3433] e healthcare system to treat chronic 
pain may influence prescribing behavior ; thus, the primary analysis will test  for potential site (UC Health vs. 
Duke) effects. Specifically, a logistic re gression will test for treatment (E-health+ vs. TAU), site, and treatment-
by-site interaction effects, with treat ment being the effect of interest. 
 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
23. 
 9.3.2 Secondary Outcomes 
The key secondary hypothesis, that a signi ficantly greater proportion of E-health
+, relative to TAU, participants 
will have a clinically si gnificant decrease (i.e. ≥ 2 points80) in Pain Intensity score at [ADDRESS_237307]-treatment 
follow-up will be tested using logistic  regression with treatment (E-health+ vs. TAU) as the effect of interest. 
For consistency with the primary analysis, models including site effects will be evaluated.  Most of the secondary outcomes cons ist of baseline-endpoint longitudinal variables, which can reasonably be 
treated as continuous numeric values. These will be an alyzed using random-intercep t mixed model regressions 
including treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interact ion as predictor variables. For consistency with the 
primary analysis, models including ef fects of site will be evaluated. The impact of utilizing non-study chronic 
pain treatments (i.e., as self-reporte d on the pain-related treat ment assessment or EHR), other than LOT, on 
decrease in MED and pain intensity (yes/no) will be tested with logist ic regressions incl uding treatment (E-
health
+ vs. TAU), use of other chronic pain treatment (yes/no), and their interaction. In the E-health+ group, the 
relationship between treatment adherence and outcome (e.g., MED, pain) will be ev aluated with logistic 
regression with treatment adhere nce rating as the covariate.  
 9.3.3 Moderated Mediation Analyses 
The purpose of the moderated mediat ion analysis is to explore the degree to which the model in Fig. 2  is 
consistent with the obtained study results. Using all ITT data, we will perform mediation analysis
81 (empi[INVESTIGATOR_198873] 95% confidence intervals vi a bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) to test two mediati on relationships: 1) knowledge about 
pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], pain self-efficacy, and passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_198874] E-health+ on 
MED reduction, and 2) pain self-efficacy, passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and stress as  joint mediators of  the effect of 
E-health+ on pain intensity score.  We will test three potential moderators of E-health’s treatment effect using 
linear regressions. One set of analyses will test whethe r executive function (as assessed by [CONTACT_198918] B) 
moderates E-health’s effects on pain self-efficacy, passi ve copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and stress. The second will test 
whether verbal learning ability (as m easured by [CONTACT_198919]) moderates E-health’s effects on 
knowledge about pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The th ird will test whether baseline ME D moderates E-health’s effects on 
knowledge about pain/opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], pain self-effic acy, passive copi[INVESTIGATOR_198875], and stress.

complete datasets. The analyses spec ified above will be performed on each of these data sets, and the results 
will then be combined using standard rules to produ ce single inferences that reflect uncertainty due to 
missingness.

 9.4 Sample Size and Power 
The sample size calculation assumed an α level of 0.05 (two-tail). Study comp letion rates in the two prior E-
health RCTs were 92.4%
26 and 79%.[ADDRESS_237310], which required participants to ha ve an opi[INVESTIGATOR_198876], found that 21% of E-
health, compared to 7% of wait-list  control, participants reported de creasing or discontinuing their opi[INVESTIGATOR_84737];25 this difference equates to an odds ratio (OR) of 3.6. While the pr oposed trial uses a different MED 
reduction outcome ( ≥15%) than the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (any reduction), the data from  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_198877]. The EMPOWER tr ial has a target sample size of 400  (200/arm) participants – using a 
conservative estimated completion rate of 75% yields  300 total complete rs (150/arm). Having 300 completers 
would provide 80% power to detect an E-health+ treatment effect if ≥18% participants have a meaningful MED 
reduction (i.e., of at least 15%) against 7% of TAU participants ha ving a meaningful ME D reduction; this 
equates to an OR of ≥2.77.

leverage points, assess tenability of parametric assumptions, and evaluate th e extent and pattern of missing data. 
Assessment of outliers and high-influence points will be co nducted as residual analysis for specific statistical 
models, but data that appear extreme in preliminary an alyses (e.g., boxplots; Q-Q plot s) will receive particular 
attention in subsequent modeling. In  models with continuous covariates , we will use scatterplots with non-
parametric smoothing to detect subs tantial non-linear associations. Desc riptive checks and exploration will 
therefore be integrated thr ough the entire mode ling process.

current version of the study informed consent form prio r to the initiation of scre ening/baseline.  Every study 
participant should be given a c opy of the signed consent form. 
Prior to signing the informed consen t form, participants will be offered the opportunity to discuss the consent 
with research staff who are knowledgeab le about the study.  In order to ensu re that potential study participants 
understand the research study, a comp rehension “quiz” (referred to as  a comprehensio n tool) will be 
administered to potential participants.   
The informed consent form must be updated or revised wh enever important new safety information is available, 
or whenever the protocol is amended in a way that may affect a participants’ participation in the trial.  The 
participant will be informed that th eir participation is voluntary and th ey may withdraw from the study at any 
time, for any reason without penalty. I ndividuals who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will 
be treated without prejudice.   
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Study sites may be required by [CONTACT_198921] n authorization from particip ants for use of protected 
health information.  Sites will be re sponsible for communicating with their IRBs or Privacy Boards and obtaining 
the appropriate approvals or waivers to be in regulatory compliance. 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237313] file (or ha ve previously filed) a Fede ral Wide Assurance (FWA) with  the DHHS Office for Human 
Research Protection setting forth th e commitment of the organization to  establish appropriate policies and 
procedures for the protection of huma n research subjects, with documentati on sent to NIDA or its designee.

management staff/QA staff loca ted at each site and aim to provide manage ment support to the research team in 
order to ensure adherence to the protocol, SOPs, and regulatory requirements. The Lead Team will provide on-
going monitoring of study progress and will hold regular study management me etings to monitor any emergent 
problems or ongoing problematic trends, and may additionally hold individua l meetings with si te staff in order 
to assist in resolving any site-spe cific problems that impact the study. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_237316] (DSMB) 
A DSMB will examine accumulating data to  assure protection of participants’ safety while the study’s scientific 
goals are being met. The DSMB will determine whether there is support fo r continuation of the trial, or 
evidence that study procedures should be changed, or if the trial should be halted, for reasons  relating to the 
safety of the study participants, the e fficacy of the treatment under study, or inadequate trial performance (e.g., 
poor recruitment). A Data and Safety  Monitoring Plan for the trial ha s been approved by [CONTACT_4530]. 
 10.5.2 Protocol Violations Re porting and Management 
A protocol departure is any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol.  Protocol 
departures may occur on two levels, deviation versus violation.  The diff erence between a protocol deviation 
and violation has to do with the se riousness of the event and the correc tive action required.  A protocol 
deviation is considered an action (or in action) that by [CONTACT_198922] a ffect the safety, rights, or welfare of a study participant.   Protocol violations are 
departures that may compromi se the participant safety, participant righ ts, inclusion/exclusi on criteria or study 
data and could be cause for corrective actions if not re ctified or prevented from re -occurrence. Each site is 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
26. 
 responsible for tracking and reporting to their IRB as  required.  Protocol devi ations will be noted by 
[CONTACT_198923].   
 
10.5.3 Confidentiality 
To maintain participant confidentia lity, study records and data will be stored in compliance with the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.  Participant reco rds will be held confidential by 
[CONTACT_198924], secure storage of any documents that have participant identifiers, 
and secure computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data. No identifying information will 
be disclosed in reports, publications or presentations. Information collected for this study will be kept in a locked secure location accessible only to research staff and au thorized personnel directly  involved with this 
study.   10.5.4 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An adverse event (AE) for this trial testing a low risk, internet-based, intervention is defined as > 30% symptom 
deterioration from baseline as indicated by [CONTACT_39132]: 
 Pain Intensity Score as measured by [CONTACT_7854], and greater than 4, indicating at least 
moderate pain intensity 
 Pain Interference Score as measured  by [CONTACT_7854], and gr eater than 4, indicating at least 
moderate pain interference 
 The Depression score from the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DA SS-21), and higher than 
Normal/Mild range 
 The Anxiety score from the DASS-21, and higher th an Normal/Mild range 
 The Stress score from the DASS-21, a nd higher than Normal/Mild range 
Within REDCap, a report identifying participants with  potential AEs (i.e., > 30% worsening on the measures 
listed above relative to baseline) will  be generated on a weekly basis at minimum. A Central Research Staff 
member will attempt to contact [CONTACT_198925] l information; failure to 
make phone contact [CONTACT_4490] a pa rticipant over 4 a ttempts, over a period of 1 month, indicates that the AE may be 
resolved by [CONTACT_559]. During the process of obtaining ad ditional information, the res earch staff will assess for 
potential SAEs. We will use FDA criteria for SAEs (i.e., an  adverse event that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, life threat ening event, initial or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916], disability, congenital anomaly, 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage , or other significant medi cal event). All AEs/SAEs 
occurring during the course of  the clinical trial will be collected, doc umented, and reported by [CONTACT_198926]-investigators in accordance with reporting requirements. Drs. Winhusen and Wilson, for psychological 
AEs, and [CONTACT_198939] (or designated study physician), for SAEs, will manage all AEs/SAEs and make referrals 
for appropriate care, as nece ssary. All SAEs will be repor ted to the IRB of the participating sites and to the 
NIDA project officer within [ADDRESS_237317] information w ill be de-identified when 
reporting SAEs.   10.5.5 Risk/Benefit Assessment  Risks:  
• Breach of confidentiality: As with any study, there is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. To maintain 
participant confidentiality, study records and data will be stored in compliance with the International 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
27. 
 Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guide lines. Participant-reported data will be collected through REDCap, 
which is HIPAA-compliant and [ADDRESS_237318] confidentiality, including: We will 1) assign a unique ID number to each patient to label all components 
of the protocol, instead of patient na mes, 2) restrict access to the key li nking names and ID numbers to key staff 
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12758], 3) store any paper with data in a locked file cabinet. Participants will be told that agents 
of the IRB, QA monitors, and members of the DSMB will be allowed to inspect sections of their medical and 
research records related to this study, if requested.  
 • Emotional Discomfort: The particip ants may experience some emotional discomfort from answering sensitive 
and/or personal questions. There is th e possibility that the participant will  feel bored. The patient’s ability to 
respond to study assessments in the pr ivacy of his/her own home should he lp in reducing potential emotional 
discomfort. E-health is self-paced so patients can ta ke breaks should any feelings of boredom arise.   
 • E-health risks: There is lit tle to no risk associated with the E-health program, which has been found to be safe 
and efficacious in prior studies. However, we will be monitoring for adverse events as noted above. 
 Benefits: Previous research suggests th at participants ra ndomized to E-health
+ may experience significantly 
greater decreases in pain severity, pain-related interfer ence, perceived disability, depression, and pain-induced 
fear as well as significantly greater d ecreases in opi[INVESTIGATOR_198878]. Other potential benefits include the 
chance to contribute to a scientific investigation which may benefit other patients like  themselves in the future. 
The study will benefit society as a whole by [CONTACT_198927] a low cost, accessible, multidisciplinary pain 
program to people with chronic pain  that decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_198879] e and pain and improves pain self-
efficacy. The risk/benefit ratio is favorable and conduct of the rese arch well justified. 
 11.[ADDRESS_237319] many years of experi ence in coordinating data from multiple 
sources for large multisite trials.  
1) The vast majority of da ta will be patient-reported outcomes which will be collected through REDCap. This 
secure, flexible, web-based application provides: a) an intuitive interface for data entry and real time validation 
(e.g., automated data type and range ch ecks); b) HIPAA-compliant and 21 CF R Part 11- ready audit trails for 
tracking data manipulation and exports ; c) record locking an d electronic signature f unctions; d) control of 
view/edit rights; e) a tool for repo rting, monitoring and querying patient records; and f) au tomated export to 
common statistical packages. All participant-reported ou tcomes will be obtained via REDCap. In addition, the 
Central Research Staff will randomi ze participants to the E-Health
+ or TAU-only arm, using REDCap’s 
randomization module. 
 2) The WebNeuro system will be used to assess neurocognitive functioning. WebNeuro’s vendor, Brain 
Resource Ltd., has an established history of providing va lid, secure, web-based neur ocognitive assessments for 
academic researchers. WebNeuro can be used on any comp uter that has an internet  connection, a keyboard, and 
a mouse. Each participant will be assigned a unique  user ID and password and no personally identifiable 
information will be collected. Upon co mpletion of the tasks, participant data are transmit ted via a secure 
EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
28. 
 website to the Brain Resource Central Analysis Facility for rapid and sta ndardized scoring. The WebNeuro data 
will be provided to the data managers by [CONTACT_198928]. in a secure format, and participants will be 
identified in the dataset by [CONTACT_198929].  
3) The sites’ EHR will be used to identify potentially  eligible participants, and to provide study data for 
randomized participants. All EHR data will  be transmitted in a secure manner. 
4) Participants randomized to E-Health
+ will receive an email with: a link to  the E-health tutorial videos and 
their study-assigned E-health username. Participant E-H ealth progress will be mon itored by [CONTACT_198930] a 
secure, study-specific portal. When th e study is complete, the E- health adherence data will be provided to the 
data managers by [CONTACT_941] E-health vendor (Goa listics) in a secure format, and E-Health+ participants will be 
identified in the dataset by [CONTACT_34175]-assigned E-health username.

 APPENDIX A: Goalistics Chronic Pain Management Program 
 1.0 Overview of the E-health intervention Figure 1 depi[INVESTIGATOR_198894] r components of the Goalistic s Chronic Pain Management  Program, referred to as 
the E-health program in EMPOWER. Program content is delivered via fi ve Learning Centers. The Navigator 
contains the self-management tools, designed to help the user to move systematically through the program, set 
and track program goals, and monitor progress. This A ppendix provides an overview of each of these program 
components. 
             
 
            
1.1 Individually-tailored treatment plan Program participants traditionally begin the program by [CONTACT_198933], a comprehensive battery that evaluates pain status and history, copi[INVESTIGATOR_198875], pain attitudes and beliefs, 
interference with daily activities, and social responses to pain. The participant’s scores are calculated and 
compared to national age- and gender-based norms. Base d on this comparative analysis, a comprehensive report 
is provided and suggestions are ma de regarding the order of comple tion of the learning centers.  
 1.2 Help/guidance for using the E-health program Program users vary in their computer abilities. A series of [ADDRESS_237325] with use of the program.  In addition, participan ts may utilize a Feedback butt on or email us for technical 
support.    

EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237326] and learning. Interactive 
learning activities may involve the pr esentation of basic concept(s) via te xt, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], diagrams, graphs, or 
video. The program user can interact  with and practice the new material by [CONTACT_198934], journals, and/or plans. User data can be scored, graphed, tracked, reported, and sent to other 
parts of the program. Interactive ac tivities are meant to increase the se lf-relevance of the program, hold the 
participant’s attention, and to keep the user engaged with display of actual, real-time da ta in a way that is visual 
and easy-to-comprehend. An Online Activity often results in the scheduling of an Offline Practice Activity as 
described below.  2.1.2 Offline Practice Activities Offline Practice Activities are scheduled and tracked vi a the Goalistics Navigator Calendar. There are three 
types of Offline Practice Activities:  1) Self-monitoring is an im portant component of behavi or change, providing insight into problem areas at the 
outset, allowing for the prompt trac king of the nature and effectivene ss of programmatic change, and for 
improving learning. A number of the learning centers employ self-monitori ng as a means of gathering relevant, 
real-time information that the user  will enter into the subsequent in teractive activity. For example, in 
conjunction with the “Identify Positive Emotional Trigge rs” activity, the program user will use a program form 
to self-monitor positive emotions over a period of two days to identify experiences that trigger positive 
emotions. Each day, the user will receive [ADDRESS_237327] ement the self-monitoring. 
  2) Practice of a new skill (e.g., social engagement) is an e ssential component of 
behavioral change programs.   3) Having learned and practiced the underlying skills of the CPMP, the user will transition to the incorporation of lifestyle activities (e.g., exercise) into his or he r daily life. A number of 
program objectives invo lve lifestyle changes, 
such as increased exercise, regular relaxation sessions, or more active social engagement. By 
[CONTACT_198935] (see below), the ultimate goal is that these activities will become automatic and self-sustaining.   Some of the offline ac tivities utilize the Pacing 
Tool. The Pacing Tool is used to create a 
custom plan to safely and slowly increase an activity ove r time. The user selects an activity to be paced (e.g., 
walking, swimming, meditating,  spending time socializing, time sitting at the comput er), identifies the amount 
of time it can be comfortably comp leted (baseline), selects a target go al, and chooses week ly days/times to 

EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/19  
   
36. 
 complete the activity. The system then creates a plan that  initially backs the patient off of baseline by 10%, then 
increases the duration of the activit y by 10% each week until the target  time is reached. Figure 2 shows 
screenshots of the Pacing Form; Figure 3 displays a sample Pacing Plan (showing weekly schedule and 
increases), and the paced activities that were automatically scheduled on the Calendar.   
 
 
3.0  Learning Center Content The five learning centers are describe d below. The content and interactiv e activities are derived from cognitive-
behavioral, interpersonal, motivational, educational, and self-management models of ch ronic pain and strategies 
for therapeutic change. Note that we did not “invent” new interventions; ra ther we transformed evidence-based, 
face-to-face strategies into an online format. 
   

EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237328], as indicated in Figure 4. An overview video presents the underlying rationale 
and basic concepts to be learned in the center. The learning center goals and links to each of the interactive activities 
are included. A custom area on the bottom right of the page displays personalized content and links to custom plans.  
3.2 Feeling Better This learning center provides training in fundamental  methods of emotion regula tion, including identifying 
negative and positive emotional triggers, the role of relaxa tion training in emotion regulation, and incorporating 
positive emotional triggers into daily life. A set of relaxation sessions within the center, offer practice in using breathing as a trigger for relaxati on, progressive muscle relaxation,  guided imagery, and mindfulness 
meditation. See Figure 5 for an annotated screenshot.

38. 
 3.3 Doing More 
The primary goals of Doing More are to increase activity and exercise and promote goal-based activities. This 
learning center is based on behavioral and mo tivational models 
of pain self-management. As shown in the annotated screenshot (Figure 6), Doing More contains a tool to boost activity, a pacing tool, and a goal pursuit tool. The user creates a plan to pursue a personal goal each month and completes two activities that result in the creation of a personalized fitness plan involving both cardiovascular activity and one of our 15 flexibility/strength programs (created by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198895]/rehabilitation physician).     
 
     
 3.4 Relating Better This learning center is derived from interpersonal/trans actional models of pain ma nagement. The program user 
learns about types of social support and how to differentiate effective versus ineffective support. A personalized support plan is created. The importance of engaging in positive social engagement is discussed and the user creates a plan to increase social activities. See the annotated screenshot in Figure 7.

 3.5 Understanding Pain 
This learning center teaches basic concepts underlying th e biopsychosocial perspective on chronic pain and its 
management. It consists of a series of videos covering such topi[INVESTIGATOR_198896], the safe use of 
pain medication, reducing reliance on pain medication, relaxation, cognitive behavi or therapy, biomedical 
treatment options, and hypnosis. See the annotated screenshot in Figure 8. 
                
 
     
 4.0  E-health Navigator The foundation of the Chronic Pain Management Program  is goal setting and self-management. The learning 
activities of the E-health intervention focus on a consis tent goal-based process of  learning new information, 
practicing it online and offl ine, tracking progress, troubleshooting prob lems, and incorporat ing newly learned 
material into daily life. The Navigator (see Figure 9 for screenshot) delivers the self-management tools of the E-health intervention including Activity Scheduling, Track ing of Daily Progress, and Tracking of Progress of 
Offline Practice Activities. A brief ov erview of each component follows. 
 4.[ADDRESS_237329] a self-monitoring exercise  (e.g., monitoring positive em otions), schedule it on the 
calendar, and send automated email or  text alerts throughout the day.  
   

EMPOWER Protocol Version 2.1 – 5/17/[ADDRESS_237330] the user in  tracking progress over time. 
Using a visual 5-star rating scale, the program user rates mood, pain management, and activity level. As 
displayed in Figure 9, the three rating s are displayed in a color coded, 30-da y graph, allowing the user to track 
progress and to observe relati onships among the variables. As users comp lete the learning centers, they will be 
able to visually track improvements.  Note that the Daily Check-In is linked to a separate set of program features: Mood Boosters, Pain Soothers, and Activity Boosters. These tools allow the user to create a set of activi ties or experiences to 
boost mood, decrease pain, and increase activity. For example, a Mood Booster is defined as indicated in Figure 10 and mood boosters are created as shown in Figure 11. They can then be added to the calendar as needed. Pain Soothers and Activity Boosters are also easy-to-implement, brief activities to provide a noticeable reduction in pain or increase in activity.  Low mood, low pain 
management, or low activity ratings in 
the Daily Check-In over several days will trigger a reminder to schedule a Mood 
Booster, Pain Soother, or Activity Booster.

4.3 Track Progress of Off line Practice Activities 
The user can monitor daily progress by [CONTACT_198936] m activities were completed or not 
completed. If the user completed the activity, s/he is  asked to indicate how help ful it was and how much the 
activity helped the user move closer to the Learning Ac tivity goal. In addition, the user will be asked what 
facilitated the completion of the activity. On the other ha nd, if the user is unable to  complete a daily activity, 
he/she will be asked to indicate what specifi cally interfered with activity completion.  
All of the above information is automatically compi[INVESTIGATOR_198897], a critical source of information to help th e user stay on track. Daily entries about what helps and 
interferes with activity completion ar e displayed, and compared to thos e of other program users. This 
information will help the user to understand his/her progr ess and to troubleshoot lack of progress. The system 
also displays progress in terms of Activity Completion Ra te, the percentage of times that the user completed a 
scheduled activity. Each week, if the overall completi on rate is reasonably high (e.g., 75% or greater), a 
congratulatory message will be sent along with the suggest ion that the user select a reward from his/her Self-
Reward Menu: a personalized list of rewards generated by [CONTACT_28024]. The tool is similar in structure to the Mood 
Boosters, Pain Soothers, and Activity Boosters tools. The Self-Reward tool allows the patient to create a 
personalized list of inexpensive, easy-to-implement rewards to self-administer for progress and success within the program. See Figure 12 for a sample My Progress report.

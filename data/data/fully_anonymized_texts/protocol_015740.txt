Since the primary intent of this trial is to evaluate the effect of the drug when taken 
as intended in the protocol, a hypothetical strategy will be employed for the 
intercurrent event of treatment/study discontinuation (due to any reason). 
Specifically, the assumption will be that had the subjects not discontinued, their 
efficacy would have been similar to the efficacy of subjects from the same treatment 
group who did not discontinue. For other intercurrent events that do not cause 
treatment/study discontinuation such as modest treatment non- compliance, protocol 
allowed dose adjustments, or initiation or adjustment of concomitant medications 
related to other symptoms all observed values will be used.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS)
Title: AMulticenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial of
Troriluzolein Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Rationale: First-line treatment forGeneralized Anxiety Disorder(GAD)includes 
cognitive behavior therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
and serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] (SNRIs). Nonetheless, up 
to 50% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional 
pharmacotherapy[1]. While SSRIs, SNRIs, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_670791], the majority of patients do 
not have an adequate response to pharmacologic treatment.
The proposed study is based on recent preclinical, clinical, and
neuroimaging studies that implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the 
pathogenesis of GAD [2-8]. In addition. the results from apublished 
clinical studyexamining the use of riluzole, a glutamate modulating agent,
suggested efficacy in patients with GAD[2-4].
Troriluzoleis anovel glutamate modulating drug that is being developed 
for thepotential treatment ofGAD.
Troriluzoleis a tripeptide prodrug of the glutamate modulating agent 
riluzolethat has been optimized for improved bioavailability, 
pharmacokinetics and dosing. Riluzole is currently only indicated for ALS 
and has a number of non-desirable attributes that have limited its clinical 
use. Key limitations of riluzole include:
•Poor oral bioavailability —When riluzole is administered in a tablet 
form, approximately 40% is either not absorbed or is metabolized in the 
liver before reaching systemic circulation. 
•Negative food effect —Riluzole must be taken on an empty stomach, at 
least one hour before or two hours after a meal. Failure to adhere to these 
guidelines results in lower drug levels and potentially decreased 
therapeutic effects.
•Negative effect on liver —Riluzole has been shown to have dose-
dependent liver effects that include elevations on liver function tests. 
Taking riluzole necessitates regular laboratory monitoring of liver 
function.

Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 6of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019•Pharmacokinetic variability —Due to extensive first-pass metabolism 
and CYP1A2 metabolism.
Troriluzolewas developed to address limitations of riluzole that have 
restricted its broader clinical application. Based on thepreclinical features of 
troriluzoleand data from a completed Phase 1 studyof troriluzole, we 
anticipate the clinical pharmacology to offer favorable properties as compared 
to available riluzole: 
1. Troriluzoleis expected to have better oral bioavailability ;
2. Troriluzoleis expected to have no food restrictions imposed ;
3. Troriluzoleis designed to release riluzole after by[CONTACT_460081]-pass 
metabolism and thus confer lower overall drug burden to the liver , which 
may translate into a better safety and tolerability profile;
4. Troriluzoleis expected to have reduced pharmacokinetic variability and be 
dosed only once daily .
As an optimized prodrug of riluzole, the regulatory pathway for troriluzole
will rely on toxicology data with troriluzolein rodents and non-human 
primates, clinical experience with troriluzolein other clinical disorders such 
as spi[INVESTIGATOR_87781], and the well-characterized safety experience of 
riluzole, which has been marketed globally for over 20 years and is considered 
safeand well tolerated.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1 Background
Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. [Biohaven] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new drug, troriluzole(BHV4157),
for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Troriluzoleis a novel and optimized 
prodrug of the glutamatergic agent riluzole. The FDA originally approved riluzole 
(RILUTEK®) 50 mg twice-a-day(NDA #20-599) for the treatment of patients with 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Riluzole, which is only indicated for ALS, has been 
marketed globally for over [ADDRESS_906282] limited its clinical use. Troriluzoleis a tripeptide prodrug 
of the glutamate modulating agent riluzole that has been optimized for improved 
bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and dosing. The proposed study in GADis based on recent 
preclinical, clinical and neuroimaging studies that implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the 
pathogenesis of GAD[2-8]. Biohaven hypothesizes that the glutamatemodulation effects of 
troriluzolemay address underlying pathologic brain function that is associated with GAD, and 
thus provide symptomatic benefit in patients suffering from GAD.
1.1.1 Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
GAD represents adisorder of significant unmet need, affecting approximately 4.3% of the 
population at some point in their life[9] Approximatelyone-third of cases areconsidered 
severe.  GAD is a chronic condition characterized by [CONTACT_670833].  Rates of 
full remission have been observed to be low[10], with recovery rates from the index epi[INVESTIGATOR_670794] 60% after a 12-year follow-up. Of those who experienced a recovery, approximately 
half experienced a recurrence within the same observation period [10], over 25% recurring 
within 3 years of remission [11] In clinical studies of approved treatments (SSRIs and SNRIs) 
the rates of remission are typi[INVESTIGATOR_15120] 50%[1]. Patients who experience a partial recovery 
are more vulnerable to relapse[12]. Further, patients with GAD have increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease. The social impact includes increased risk of not marrying, absenteeism 
(average of one week per month), increased risk of suicide, and high healthcare costs. Minimal 
research has been conducted on the treatment of GAD that has not responded to conventional 
therapy. Frequently treatment-resistant patients are adjunctively administered benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_670795]. Based on the unmet 
medical need described above, additional treatments are required for populations with GAD
that has not responded adequately to pharmacotherapy.
1.1.2 Rationale for Troriluzole in the Treatment of GAD
The proposed study is based on recent preclinical, clinical, and neuroimaging studies that 
implicate glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of GAD[2-8] Preclinical data with 
riluzole (the active metabolite of troriluzole)demonstrated rapid acting antianxiety effects in 
multiple preclinical models.  Efficacy was similar to a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_670796] [7, 8, 13].
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 18of 80
Draft Version 03; [ADDRESS_906283] benefit from the glutamate modulator riluzole in individuals with 
GAD. In a open-label study by [CONTACT_670834], 12 of 15 patients treated who completed the trial 
responded positively to riluzole on the HAM-Aover the 8 week course of the trial[2].  As part 
of this study, subjects received proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic 
resonance imaging scans to measure the effect of riluzole on N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which 
is a mitochondrial amino acid considered to be a marker of neuronal integrity.  In general, 
responders showed increases in hippocampal NAA compared to nonresponders and a 
relationship was seen between changes in hippocampal NAA and anxiety symptoms at study 
end compared to baseline [3].   In addition, MRI showed a positive correlation between 
hippocampal volume, NAA concentration and HAM-A improvement [4].  
The tremendous unmet medical need in anxiety disorders combined with favorable clinical 
experience with riluzole to date, warrant the identification and clinical development of an 
optimized formulation of riluzole.  The therapeutic potential of riluzole has been suggested by 
[CONTACT_670835] a variety of psychiatric  conditions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-Clinical Studies
Data from preclinical studies support the following findings. Please refer to the IB for 
additional pre-clinical information. 
No activity at a broad screen of enzymes and receptors, including hERG
Toxicology studies in rats and monkeys reveal no novel findings relative to what has been 
reported for riluzole;
Safety pharmacology studies indicate no clinically relevant changes in hERG, 
cardiovascular parameters or respi[INVESTIGATOR_108951]. Minimal changes on neurobehavioral 
parameters at high dose levels are consistent with the known sedative effects of riluzole in 
rats;
No signals for carcinogenicity (negative for Ames assay, in vitro chromosomal aberrations 
and in vivo micronucleus)

BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 19of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019The longer-term safety profile of troriluzole is expected to be similar to riluzole based on the 
following: 
Troriluzole is a tripeptide prodrug of riluzole. It readily metabolizes to riluzole and
composite amino acids, sarcosine and glycine. These amino acids are generally non- toxic 
and will be taken up into their normal physiologic role in the body; 
Troriluzole was designed to be stable enough to by[CONTACT_670836]-pass metabolism before being 
metabolized.  Performance in healthy volunteers has been similar to what has been 
observed in preclinical species, insofar as the concentrations of troriluzole have been 
negligible compared to active metabolite and time to peak concentration of the active 
metabolite has been delayed relative to troriluzole. In addition, the time to peak 
concentration of the active metabolite (Tmax) is delayed compared to troriluzole.  This 
Tmax is longer than that seen with rilutek tablets.  This PK pattern of delayed time to peak 
riluzole concentration is consistent with diminished first pass liver metabolism.
Troriluzole has no relevant intrinsic receptor activity as tested in 88 ion channels and 
receptors, including hERG; 
Toxicology assessments in two preclinical species reflect no novel safety signals as 
compared to riluzole; 
Troriluzole, dosed between 140-280 mg, contains a comparablemolar amount of riluzole as 
found in a 70-140 mg dose of riluzole, well below the 200 mg daily dose of riluzole that has 
been studied in frail subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis where it was found to be 
safely administered and generally well-tolerated.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191.[IP_ADDRESS] BHV4157 Phase 2 – BHV4157-201
BHV4157-201 was a Phase 2b/3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
parallel-group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of troriluzole in 
subjects with spi[INVESTIGATOR_87781] (SCA). Subjects were randomized to receive troriluzole
(140 mg PO once daily [QD]) or placebo for 8 weeks. A total of 141 subjects were randomized 
into the double-blind randomization phase (71 subjects in the troriluzole 140 mg QD group and 
70 subjects in the placebo group). 
During the double-blind randomization phase, administration of troriluzole at 140 mg QD for 8 
weeks was well tolerated in adult subjects with SCA. There were no deaths reported during the 
randomization phase of this study. Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for 5 (3.55%) 
subjects, including 4 troriluzole-treated subjects (asthenia, atrial fibrillation, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, dehydration, back pain and cerebral infarction), and [ADDRESS_906284] (chest discomfort). No clinically meaningful trends in laboratory values were 
identified in this study. No subject had AST or ALT laboratory abnormalities > [ADDRESS_906285]. 
Subjects who completed the double-blind randomization phase were offered 96 weeks of open- 
label treatment with troriluzole (140 mg PO QD) in an extension phase. In the first 48-week 
portion of the Extension Phase, subjects who experienced a decline (as defined by 
[CONTACT_228928] a [ADDRESS_906286] recent consecutive visits accompanied by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_670797]) may 
be increased to 280 mg daily.  One hundred and thirty (131) subjects continued into the open-
label extension phase, which is currently on-going.  To date, the preliminary safety profile of 
troriluzole 140 mg QD is consistent with the troriluzole safety profile observed during the 
randomization phase. CCI

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191.1.3 Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions
Troriluzole: Troriluzole, itself, is not expected to interfere with drug metabolism and its 
cleavage via plasma peptidases renders it unlikely to be affected significantly by [CONTACT_119387] P450 inhibitors. Troriluzolehas the following known pharmacokinetic/metabolism 
parameters:
Not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, orCYP2D6
In CYP inductionstudies:
oThe estimated E -fold 
induction,respectively;
o -fold 
induction, respectively;and
oTroriluzoledid not increase CYP3A4 mRNA at doses up to 30
Riluzole Metabolism: Troriluzolemetabolizes to riluzole. As per the USPI, riluzole metabolism 
has been assessed in special populations, characterized by [CONTACT_347097] (2 to 3 fold 
increase in AUC with Child-Pugh Scores of A and B), renal impairment (no effect), age (no 
effect), gender (no effect), smokers (20% faster elimination) and race (Japanese compared to 
Caucasians: no effect).
Effect of other drugs on Riluzole metabolism: In vitro studies using human liver microsomal 
preparations suggest that CYP1A2 is the principal isozyme involved in the initial oxidative 
metabolism of riluzole and, therefore, potential interactions may occur when riluzole is given 
concurrently with agents that affect CYP1A2 activity. Potential inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., 
cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, oral 
contraceptives, thiabendazole, vemurafenib, zileuton ) could decrease the rate of riluzole 
elimination, while inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g., cigarette smoke, charcoal-broiled food, 
rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], and omeprazole) could increase the rate of riluzole elimination.
Effect of Riluzole on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: CYP1A2 is the principal isoenzyme 
involved in the initial oxidative metabolism of riluzole; potential interactions may occur when 
riluzole is given concurrently with other agents which are also metabolized primarily by 
[CONTACT_097]1A2 (e.g., theophylline, caffeine, and tacrine). Currently, it is not known whether riluzole 
has any potential for enzyme induction in humans.
Clinical drug interaction studies for troriluzolehave not been conducted yet.
1.1.4 Clinical Adverse Event Profile
Troriluzole readily metabolizes to riluzole. Therefore, the 20 years’ global clinical experience 
is important to summarize herein.

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20191.1.4.3 Riluzole
Clinical information on riluzole, as reflected in the USPI, is predominantly based on experience 
from approximately 4000 patients given riluzole for ALS. Refer to the US Prescribing 
Information (15) where greater details on the adverse event profile of riluzole can be found.  
The following summarizes relevant information.
Overall, riluzole tablets have been well tolerated in populations with ALS and diverse 
neuropsychiatric conditions that include Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized 
Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_87781]. In randomized controlled trials comparing 
a 100 mg daily dose of riluzole with placebo, no AEs occurred at rates greater than 5% and 
twice that of placebo. The AEs occurring greater than 5% and at least 2% more than placebo 
included asthenia (18% vs 12% placebo) and nausea (14% vs 9%). These two AEs showed 
trends for a dose response (16). The published literature on the use of riluzole tablets in 
psychiatric disorders, while generally comprised of case-series, is consistent with this 
tolerability profile.
The most commonly observed AEs associated with the use of riluzole tablets more frequently
than placebo treated patients were:
asthenia;
nausea;
dizziness;
decreased lung function;  
diarrhea;
abdominal pain; 
pneumonia; 
vomiting;
vertigo; 
circumoral paresthesia;
anorexia; andCCI

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019somnolence.
Approximately 14% (n = 141) of the [ADDRESS_906287] commonly reported were: nausea, 
abdominal pain, constipation, and ALT elevations. In a dose response study in ALS patients, 
the rates of discontinuation of RILUTEK for asthenia, nausea, abdominal pain, and ALT 
elevation were dose related. The AEs of asthenia, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, anorexia, vertigo, 
somnolence, andcircumoralparesthesia were dose related. Assessment of pulmonary AEs is 
confounded by [CONTACT_670837], ALS, which is associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_670798].
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Elevations in Liver Function Tests
Troriluzolehas not been associated with significant changes in liver function or pathology in 
nonclinical toxicology studies to date, as reflected in the IB. No clinically significant LFT 
changes were observed on study drug in BHV4157-101.  In the ongoing clinical trial in SCA, 
LFTs remain blinded; however, no subjects were required to discontinue study medication due 
to elevated LFTs.  
Riluzole is associated with elevations in aminotransferases that have been reflected in 
monitoring precautions that will be followed within this protocol. Experience in almost 800 
ALS patients indicates that about 50% of riluzole-treated patients will experience at least one 
ALT/SGPT level above the upper limit of normal, about 8% will have elevations > [ADDRESS_906288], 
and about 2% of patients will have elevations > [ADDRESS_906289]. A single non-ALS patient with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_670799], rapid 
elevations of liver enzymes with jaundice (ALT [ADDRESS_906290]) four months after starting riluzole; these returned to normal 7 weeks after treatment 
discontinuation. Maximum increases in serum ALT usually occurred within 3 months after the 
start of riluzole therapy and were usually transient when < [ADDRESS_906291]. In trials, if ALT levels 
were < [ADDRESS_906292] had riluzole discontinued for ALT > [ADDRESS_906293] been reported, including one with fatal outcome.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_906294] in the 17.5 mg BID cohort experienced transient 
and mildly decreased white blood cell count after three days of treatment; however, this subject 
evidenced moderate decline during the screening period prior to medication administration.  
The subject’s count increased while on continued study drug and normalized within 6 days 
after onset.
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 27of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019For riluzole, according to the USPI, rare cases of neutropenia were reported. Among 
approximately 4,000 patients given riluzole for ALS in clinical trials, there were three cases of 
marked neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3), all seen within the first [ADDRESS_906295] casewas more complex, with 
marked anemia as well as neutropenia and the etiology of both is uncertain. Patients should be 
warned to report any febrile illness to their physicians. The report of a febrile illness should 
prompt treating physicians to check white blood cell counts.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_906296] been reported, 
some of them severe; upon further investigation, many of these cases were hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis. If respi[INVESTIGATOR_670800]/or dyspnea, chest 
radiography should be performed, and in case of findings suggestive of interstitial lung disease 
or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (e.g., bilateral diffuse lung opacities), riluzole should be 
discontinued immediately. In the majority of the reported cases, symptoms resolved after drug 
discontinuation and symptomatic treatment.
1.1.5 Potential Risk to Fetal Development
Troriluzolehas not yet been assessed in fertility and fetal development studies.
As described in the USPI, oral administration of riluzole to pregnant animals during the period 
of organogenesis caused embryotoxicity in rats and rabbits at doses of 27 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, 
respectively, or 2.6 and 11.5 times, respectively, the recommended maximum human daily 
dose on a mg/m2 basis. Evidence of maternal toxicity was also observed at these doses. When 
administered to rats prior to and during mating (malesand females) and throughout gestation 
and lactation (females), riluzole produced adverse effects on pregnancy (decreased 
implantations, increased intrauterine death) and offspring viability and growth at an oral dose 
of 15 mg/kg or 1.5 times the maximum daily dose on a mg/m2 basis. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Riluzole should be used during pregnancy only if 
the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to thefetus.
1.2 StudyRationale
1.2.1 Study Design Rationale
Troriluzoleis a glutamate modulating drug that is being developed for the potential treatment 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_87781] (SCA), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Alzeimer’s 
disease. This protocol represents the first trial of troriluzolein Generalized Anxiety Disorder
(GAD).
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 28of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Troriluzoleis a novel tripeptide prodrug of the glutamate modulating agent riluzole. The 
proposed study is based on recent preclinical, clinical and neuroimaging studies that implicate 
glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of GAD[2-8]. Whiletroriluzolehas yet to be 
studied in GAD, studies with riluzole in populations with GADprovide support for the 
therapeutic potential of troriluzole[2-4]. Trials have also suggested the benefit of riluzole in 
individuals with OCD [17, 18].
Riluzole has several modes of action; prominent among them, are a reduction in glutamate 
outflow due to effects on the excitatory amino acid transporters [19]. Given the evidence for 
the potential role of glutamate in GAD, and that troriluzoleis a prodrug of riluzole, it is 
hypothesized that it would be expected to have therapeutic value in GADas a glutamate 
modulatingagent.
Troriluzolewas developed to advance upon the limitations of riluzole that have restricted its 
broader clinical application. Riluzole tablets have 60% bioavailability, attributed to high first-
pass metabolism in the liver. This is thought to be related to metabolism by [CONTACT_119366]1A2 enzyme, which is also attributable to the high PK 
variability associated with riluzole. In addition, riluzole is associated with reduced exposure 
when taken with meals (i.e., a negative food effect), resulting in the guidance to take riluzole 
within a three hour fast (one hour before ortwo hours after a meal). Riluzole is also dosed 
twice a day, has dose-dependent effects on liver function tests and the drug substance itself has 
other intrinsic limitations including: very low solubility in water, poor oral palatability, pH 
dependent chemical stability and intense oral numbness if administered directly to the oral 
mucosa.
In an effort to mitigate the aforementioned limitations of riluzole, several classes of prodrugs 
were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in multiple in vitro stability assays to predict in vivo 
drug levels [20]. Troriluzoleis a third generation of prodrug development representing 
multiple years of chemistry effort with optimized in vivo and in vitro features based on stability 
while transiting the digestive system, enhanced gastrointestinal absorption, avoidance of first 
pass metabolism, favorable safety pharmacology, metabolic cleavage in the plasma, and 
enhanced pharmacokinetic properties.
Based on the preclinical features of troriluzole, we anticipate the clinical pharmacology to offer 
favorable properties as compared to available riluzole:
Troriluzoleis expected to have better oralbioavailability;
Troriluzoleis designed to release riluzole after by[CONTACT_460081]-pass metabolism and thus 
confer lower overall drug burden to the liver, which may translate into a better safety and 
tolerability profile as well as reduced pharmacokineticvariability;
Troriluzoleis expected to allow for once daily dosing, thus improvingmedication 
compliance;
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol V03 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 29of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Troriluzole is expected to be readily absorbed in both the fasting and fed states; thus, the 
prodrug is not anticipated to require any special meal restrictions. In contrast, oral riluzole 
tablets require a 3-hour window of fasting around the two daily doses;

1.3  Research Hypothesis
Troriluzole monotherapy is associated with superior therapeutic effects as compared to placebo 
over an 8 week treatment period in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. CCI

The SAFER interview will be conducted remotely with the subject by a CRO shortly after 
the screening visit.  A SAFER pass is necessary for the subject to berandomized.
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events for details on Screening Procedures.
4.3.2 Randomization Phase
Subjects who are determined to be eligible for the study will enter the Randomization Phase. 
Subjects will receive troriluzole(100 mg BID) or placebo (BID)(in a 1:1 ratio).
Dosing will continue for 8 weeks. Subjects will return to the clinic two weeks after discontinuing 
study medication for a follow-up safety visit (unless they are continuing in the Extension Phase).
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosing due to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to [ADDRESS_906308] down titrates they will need to stay on that dose for the duration of

9.2.5.
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments/Time & Events for details on procedures during the 
Randomization Phase. There is a visit window of +/-2 day visit window during the 
Randomization Phase of the study. It is estimated that approximately 372 subjects will enter this 
phase of the trial.

Other medications:  Other medications not explicitly called out herein are allowed during the 
Randomization Phase, provided they (1) have been prescribed for a sufficient duration (at least 30 
days)that theinvestigator can adequately assess tolerability and deems them to be well-tolerated; 
(2) do not limit subject’s ability to perform key rating scales by [CONTACT_670852];
(3) the regimen and dose (± 25% )have been stable for at least 30 days prior to screening and are
not anticipated to change during the Randomization Phase; (4)could not adversely affect 
assessment of safety orefficacy.  
Any medication adjustments or the initiation of new medications are recommended to be 
addressed during the Extension Phase, preferably no sooner than afterfour weeks of treatment 
during this phase so as not to confound assessment of safety / tolerability.
Lorazepam up to 2 mg/day (or equivalent benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) can be used prn during the Extension

5.5 Woman of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) include any female who has experienced menarche 
and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, 
or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as:
oAmenorrhea greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months without another cause and a 
documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 35mIU/mL or;
oWoman with irregular menstrual periods and a documented serumfollicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level > 35mIU/mLor;
oNOTE: FSH level testing is not required for women greater than or equal to62 years old 
with amenorrhea of greater than or equal to oneyear;
oWoman on hormone replacement therapy(HRT).
The requisite drug interaction studies to determine the interaction of troriluzolewith oral 
contraceptives have not been completed to date. It is therefore not possible to determine the 
efficacy of oral contraceptives as an effective method of contraception for WOCBP who are 
participating in this study. Oral estrogen and progestin hormonal contraceptives as a sole method 
of contraception are therefore prohibited. It is required that all WOCBP use two methods of 
contraception for the duration of the study (i.e. beginning at 30 days prior to baseline) through [ADDRESS_906320] dose of study drug. The two methods should include one barrier method (e.g. 
diaphragm with spermicidal gel, condom with spermicidal gel, intrauterine devices, cervical cap) 
and one other method. The other method could include oral contraceptives (e.g. oral 
contraceptives, injectable contraceptives or contraceptive implant) or another barrier method.
Any male who has a female partner of WOCBP has to avoid becoming pregnant while 
participating in this study. If male subjects are sexually active and not vasectomized for at least [ADDRESS_906321]’s female partner is not surgically sterile or is not post -menopausal, 
then one of the following accepted methods of contraception should be used throughout the study 
and for [ADDRESS_906322] study drugadministration:
oSimultaneous use of male condom, and for the female partner, hormonal contraceptives 
(e.g., birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], implants, patch, depot injection, used sinceat least 4 weeks) or 
intra-uterine contraceptive device (placed since at least 4 weeks) before sexual 
intercourse;
oSimultaneous use of male condom, and for the female partner, diaphragmwith 
intravaginally appliedspermicide.

7 ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENTS
7.1 MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)
The MINI is a structured interview for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders that will be 
conducted at screening to confirm the diagnosis of GADand assess for the presence of other 
major psychiatric conditions.
7.2 SAFER Interview
The SAFER Interview is a structured interview conducted remotely by a CRO(telephone call 
to subject)shortly after the screening visit is completed to confirm the diagnosis, treatment 
history and GADseverity.A SAFER pass is necessary for randomization. This will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_670854]. Additional 
details about this interview will be provided in the Informed Consent Form.
7.3 Medical and Psychiatric History
A full medical history will need to be obtained at the screening visit. This will include but is not

Any lab value outside of the normal range must be brought to the attention of a physician 
(Investigator or Sub-Investigator) at the site. The Investigator will indicate whether or not a 
flagged value is of clinical significancein the source document. In addition, if warranted repeat 
labs can be drawn.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics
A pharmacokinetic sample will be collected at Week 2, Week 6, and Week [ADDRESS_906325] meal for entry into the eDC system. Subjects who are able to 
schedule a morning visit for Week 2 and Week 6 can be instructed to hold their dose of study 
drug that morning until after a PK trough sample is obtained, if possible and appropriate.
Additionally, PK samples should be drawn if there are any SAEs in either the Randomization or 
Extension Phase of the study that are assessed as possibly drug-related or severe AEs that could 
be drug-related.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogenetics
A pharmacogenetics blood sample will be obtained at baseline and end of study (Week 8 
Randomization Phase) for possible future exploratory analysis investigating how genetic variation 
may determine troriluzoleefficacy and safety. All subjects will sign a pharmacogenomics ICF 
indicating whether they are consenting to or not consenting to provide a pharmacogenetic blood 
sample. All subjects will be informed that consenting to provide a blood sample for 
pharmacogenetic analysis is optional and does not affect participation in the study.
DNA samples will be stored indefinitely from subjects who have provided written informed 
consent unless a written request for destruction of the sample is provided by [CONTACT_670857]-sponsored clinical trial. This written request provided by [CONTACT_670858]’s pharmacogenetic samples should be provided by

Pregnancy testing should be performed on all women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) during 
both the Randomization Phase and Extension Phase of the study. Refer to the Schedule of 
Assessments/Time & Events for detailed time points in which serum pregnancy tests and urine 
pregnancy tests are required. Urine pregnancy testing may also be done at the discretion of the 
Investigator at any time during the study. Subjects should not continue in the study if the 
pregnancy test is positive at any time.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Laboratory Assessments
The management of abnormal LFTs are described herein. Scheduled LFTs (ALT, AST, bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase) at Week 4 and through Week 48 visits (see Schedule of Assessments for 
details) will be evaluated by a physician or other qualified medical personnel.
If AST or ALT values are between 3x ULN and <5x ULN, the Investigator will medically 
evaluate the subject. Medical assessment of the subject can include the following:
Must include repeat LFT assessments (ALT, AST, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, PT, aPTT, INR) within 1 week and follow until resolution. The frequencyof the 
repeat tests will be clinically based on trajectory of change (e.g., improving, stable vs 
increasing). These tests can be performed either at a local, or preferably, central lab
Assessment of AEs, usage of concomitant medications, exposure to potential hepatictoxins, 
risk factors for hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease
Based on overall clinical presentation (severity and extent of lab abnormalities; rate ofchange 
of lab values), additional evaluations (as outlined under the scenario of ALT/AST > 5xULN) 
may be considered.
If any visit shows ALT or AST>5x ULN, the Investigator will assess this as a potential SAE. The 
subject will be managed as appropriate, including:
Study medication must be discontinued immediately
Bring subject in for physical exam and evaluation.
oAssess for right heart failure, hypotension, and signs/symptoms of alcohol abuse
oAssess for exposure to toxic dietary/herbal supplements and/or prescriptions drugs that are 
associated with hepatic effects, such as acetaminophen;
oAssess for potential exposure to environmental toxins
oEvaluate for abdominal pain, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly

Consider gall bladder or ductal imaging studies if presentation suggests potential for gall 
stones.
Entry into the Extension Phase requires continued impression that open-label treatment offers an 
acceptable risk-benefit profile. If lab abnormalities in the Randomization Phase arepotentially 
clinically significant then treatment with study drug in the Extension Phase should not begin until 
such labs near normal limits or in the case of elevated transaminases (ALT orAST) are within 3x 
ULN. If results from the scheduled Week [ADDRESS_906326] orALT > [ADDRESS_906327], re-
challenge with study drug will not be allowed.
7.4.5 Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (Sheehan STS)
The Sheehan STS (S-STS) is a prospective, clinician administered ratingscale that contains 16 
questions to track both treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviors[21, 22]. The S-STS 
will be completed on a paper form at the site. At the screening visit, the recall period for 
completing the S-STS is 6 months prior; at all other visits, the recall period for completing the S-
STS is since the last visit. Subjects who have a S-STS score > [ADDRESS_906328]’s safety and obtain mental health evaluation must be 
implemented. The subject must immediately be discontinued from the study. The event should be 
recorded as either an AE or SAE as determined by [CONTACT_222459] 24 hours 
to the Sponsor.
7.5 Clinical Outcome Assessments
Training will be provided for all clinical outcome assessments through either didactic, video 
certification, and/or online training.  
The order of the tests should include the administration of the HAM-Aprior to other clinical / 
safety outcome assessments, followed by [CONTACT_88807].

Draft Version 03; 01 Aug20197.5.1 Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)
The HAM-Ais a clinician-administered scale used extensively in research and clinical practice to 
both rate severity of GADand to monitor improvement during treatment. It is designed to rate the 
severity of anxietyas well as thetype of symptoms in patients with GAD. The HAM-A will be 
utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of the pati ent’s level of anxiety and must be 
administered utilizing a structured interview guide, the Structured Interview Guide for the 
Hamilton Anxiety Scale (SIGH-A)[23].
The scale consists of 14 items. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe) with 
a total score range of 0-56.  Subscale scores can be calculated for psychicanxiety factor (sum of 
HAM-A items anxious mood, tension, fears, insomnia, concentration, depressed mood, and 
behavior at interview), and somatic anxietyfactor (sum of HAM-A items somatic muscular, 
somatic sensory, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary and autonomic 
symptoms).
Raters must be trained and pre-approved by [CONTACT_670860] (i.e. CRO) to rate 
subjects on the HAM-A. Raters must complete training and receive their certification prior to 
administering the HAM-Ato study subjects. 
7.5.2 Placebo-Control Reminder Script (PCRS)
The Placebo-Control Reminder Script (PCRS)is a statement read by a clinician to a subject prior 
to every administration of the HAM-Athroughout the study. It is intended to provide a 
standardized method for educating subjects on what it means to be in a placebo-controlled study, 
expectations regarding clinical benefit, and how to interact with study staff, to minimizing the 
placebo effect.
7.5.3 Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)
The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a patient-rated measure of functional disability in domains 
of work, social and family life. The SDS has demonstrated sensitivity to treatment effects in 
numerous randomized controlled trials in populations with varied diagnoses (70).  The assessment 
is a three item questionnaire measuringdisease-related disruption of work, social life and family 
life.  Respondents evaluate impairment on an 11 point scale from 0 -10 with anchor definitions. 
The 3 items can also be summed into a single dimensional measure of global functional 
impairment that rages from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).
Subjects may indicate that item 1 of the SDS (Work/School) is not applicable to them by 
[CONTACT_62262] a box labeled “ I have not worked / studied at all during the past week for reasons 
unrelated to the disorder. ” For these subjects item [ADDRESS_906329] checks the “not working” box for the Work/School item, you MUST check 
compliance to this instruction, before the visit ends.

Subjects will be rated on the seven-point Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Global 
Improvement (CGI-I) scales of the CGI.  The CGI-S is rated during the screening phase as a 
screening assessment to determine eligibility for entry into the study.  
A Sponsor approved rater, preferably a psychiatrist, should administer the CGI.  All efforts 
should be made to ensure that the same clinician administers the CGI-S and CGI-I for a 
given patient.  Notation in the subject’s study records should substantiate the CGI ratings.

to measure verbal learning and memory in individuals ages [ADDRESS_906333] of 12 nouns; the 
examiner reads the list to the examinee, who repeats as many words as remembered, in any order. 
This process is repeated three times; 20-25 minutes later, examinees are asked again to recall as 
many words as possible; for the final task, the examiner reads a list of 24 words (including the [ADDRESS_906334]) and asks the examinee after each whether the word was on the list [24].
7.5.8 Clinical Trial and Site Scale-B (CTSS-B)
The Clinical Trial and Site Scale-B (CTSS-B) is a scale to assess potential domains associated 
with placebo response.  Thescale is a patient reported assessment and consists of 26 items.   
Items 1-24 are rated on a scale from 1 (“Completely Disagree”) to 9 (“Completely Agree”).

[ADDRESS_906335] withdraws consent for all study 
procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e. is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated 
for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
[ADDRESS_906336] in some regions, is 
defined as follows:
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized 
indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to the local regulations. It 
is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that the investigational product is only dispensed 
to study patients. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by 
[CONTACT_20443].
In this protocol, the investigational products are: troriluzolecapsules 100 mg and matching 
placebo.
9.1.2 Packaging, Shipment and Storage
Clinical Trial Materials should be stored at controlled temperature between 200C and 250 C (680F
-770F), with excursions permitted between 150C and 300 C (590F-860F), in a secure, temperature 
controlled, limited access area. Themedications will be stored in a locked, environmentally-
controlled medication room with restricted access. Container(s) will bear a label containing at 
least the name [CONTACT_115210], lot and/or batch numberand storage conditions.
9.2 Dose andAdministration
9.2.1 Randomization Phase
During the randomization phase, all subjects will be randomized to receive troriluzole 100 mg 
BID or placebo BID.

Draft Version 03; [ADDRESS_906337] study drugtwice per day (BID)once in the morning and 
once in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart).  Study drug can be taken without regard to 
meals. 
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosingdue to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to [ADDRESS_906338] study drug twice per day 
(BID)once in the morning and once in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart).  Study drug 
can be taken without regard to meals.
If subjects have difficulty tolerating BID dosing due to morning dosing of 100 mg (such as 
experiencing sedation) then the investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg 
at night time only (and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg will only be allowed to address tolerability issues. Subjects may be 
rechallenged to increase to 100mg BID during the Extension Phase at the discreation of the 
investigator.
All visits of the Extension Phase will be open-label.
9.2.3 Method of Assigning Patient Identification
The investigator or designee will need to access an Interactive Web-based Response System 
(IWRS) in order to register each subject in each study phase. Initially the investigator or designee 
will enter the subject into the study at the Screening Visit after informed consent is obtained and a 
subject number is assigned. After completion of all screening evaluations, all eligible subjects 
will be randomized via IWRS at the Baseline Visit, in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo (BID)
or troriluzole(100 mg BID). Treatment assignments will be obtained by [CONTACT_093] (or 
designee) via the IWRS system.
Investigational sites will access the IWRS at each scheduled IP dispensing visit throughout the 
Randomization Phaseto dispense drug. The IWRS system will assign specific bottlenumbers for 
all blinded study drug to be dispensed to the subject. Once a bottlehas been assigned it cannot be 
dispensed to another study subject.

Extension Phase or if a subject is discontinued early from the Extension Phase of the study, the 
investigator or designee must access the IWRS to document the discontinuation of the subject 
from participation in the study.
9.2.4 Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration
During the randomization phase of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive placebo 
(BID) or troriluzole(100 mg BID). Open label BHV-[ADDRESS_906340] dose the 
day after the baseline visit.  Study medication should be administered twice per day (BID) once in 
the morning and once in the evening (approximately 12 hours apart).
9.2.5 Dose Modifications
Randomization Phase:  Subjects will receive 100 mgBID or Placebo BID for eight (8) weeks.
If subjects have difficulty tolerating 100 mg BID dosing (such as experiencing sedation) then the 
investigator may permit the subject to switch to dosing of 200 mg at night time or morning only 
(and document this change in the subject’s records).
Down titration to 100 mg once daily (QD) will only be allowed to address tolerability issues and 
only with medical monitor approval. If a subject down titrates to 100 mg QD they will need to 
stay on that dose for the duration of the Randomization Phase.
Extension Phase: Subjects entering the Extension phase will continue on the same dose that was 
taken at the end of the Randomization phase. Subjects receiving placebo in the randomization 
phase will be switched in a blinded manner to 100 mg BID or 100 mg QD.  Subjects who enter 
the Extension Phase on 100 mg QD due to tolerability issues can be rechallenged to increase to 
100 mg BID based on investigator judgement.
For subjects who do not tolerate their study treatment the investigator may permit them to switch 
to night time dosing(200 mg QD at night)if there is reason to believe that may help tolerability. 
Any such changes must be documented by [CONTACT_093].  If the subject is receiving 100 mg QD

Before breaking the blind of an individual subject ’s treatment, the investigator should have 
determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the subject ’s immediate 
management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not investigational 
product related, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_670862]. Unblinding will be managed via the IWRS 
system.
A pharmacokineticist, IWRS vendor, and pharmacovigilance rolemay be unblinded before data 
areunblinded for the primary endpoint and all subjects complete the Randomized Phaseof the 
study. Except as noted above, other members of the BHV research team will remain blinded. For 
purposes of the DMC, periodic analysis will be carried out by [CONTACT_670863].  Areport will be prepared for the DMC as outlined in the DMC charter.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_670864].
9.[ADDRESS_906342] ’s study records.
Subjects will be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as directed at all study 
visits. If poor compliance continues, (i.e., multiple missed doses resulting in less than 80% overall 
compliance during the Randomization and Extension Phase), discontinuation of the subject from 
the trial should be considered and discussed with the Sponsor.
9.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug
All unused and/or partially used study drug can be sent back to the drug depot for destruction 
onlyafter being inspected and reconcile d by [CONTACT_222465]’s 
designee.
If it is site policy to destroystudy drug on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that 
arrangements have been made for the disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been 
established according to the applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and 
appropriate records of the disposal have been documented. The unused study drugs can only be

10 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of the investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a patient. In order to prevent reporting bias, patients should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. The collection of non-serious 
AE information should begin at the initiation of study drug.
10.1 Serious Adverse Events
There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious Adverse 
Events (AEs).
10.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria at any dose:
Death;
Life-threatening;
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_670818];
Persistent or significantdisability/incapacity;
Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who receivedtroriluzole;
Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening,or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not limitedto):
oIntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home forallergic bronchospasm;
oBlood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];
oDevelopment of drug dependency or drugabuse;
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 63of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019oPotential drug induced liver injury (see section 10.1.7).
10.1.2 Definition of Terms
Mild: Is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.
Moderate: Is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or 
permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical status, or may 
require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious 
form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without 
evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced 
hepatitis can be fatal.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605224] (e.g., elective 
surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. 
If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, 
either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria.
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to 
whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222433] (but may be 
considered non-serious AEs):
A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] <24 hours that does not result in 
an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life threatening);
Elective surgery, planned prior to signingconsent;
Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgicalprocedure;
Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routinecolonoscopy);
Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing onhealth and 
requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care-giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family 
circumstances).
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 64of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_906343]’s daily activities. 
The severity of events should be graded as mild, moderate or severe.  
The Investigator’s assessment of an AEs relationship to study drug is part of the documentation 
process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. The relationship 
or association of the study drug in causing or contributing to the AE will be characterized as 
either not related or related. 
10.1.4 Collection and Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol-specific procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within 30 days of discontinuation of dosing. The investigator should report any SAE 
occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specific 
procedures.  
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the study drug, but is potentially related 
to the conditions of the study (such as a withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication related 
to study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, overdose, potential drug induced liver injury 
and pregnancies must be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
event. For this study we will be capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) and on the 
SAE form.  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs and all Other Important Medical Events 
to  immediately via telephone, upon observing or learning of the event.  will then 
immediately notify the Biohaven Medical Monitor of the event.  The SAE form must then be 
submitted to  within one working day. The Investigator is responsible for submitting all 
applicable events to the Independent Review Board (IRB) as per the IRB’s reporting 
requirements. Additionally, the Investigator, or designated staff, is responsible for enteringthe 
SAE information in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system (i.e.: event term, start stop dates, 
causality, severity).  CCI CCI

If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. If an ongoing 
SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes 
available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within [ADDRESS_906345] 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose 
(suspected or confirmed and irrespective of whether or not it involved troriluzole) must be

11 STATISTICS
Detailed plans for analysis will be summarized in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan document, 
to be written and approved prior to database unblinding. A summary of statistical aspects of the 
design and intended analysis is provided here
11.1 General Procedures
Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are 
summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum and 
maximum).  
For the calculation of descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects must have a baseline value 
to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes from baseline over time.
Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: 
protocol deviations; non-study medications; adverse events; and laboratory abnormalities. Thus, 
for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject.
Unless otherwise specified, the randomization phase and the open-label extension phase will be 
analyzed separately. For subjects receiving troriluzoleduring both phases, summary statistics will 
be provided for data from both phases combined.
11.2 Sample Size
The sample size for this study will be approximately 372 randomized subjects.
From a review of generalized anxiety disorder by [CONTACT_670870][26], data from 7 adult studies 
(treatment duration between 4 to 12 weeks) provided the standard deviation for change from 
baseline ranging from 6.0 to 8.7; the average standard deviation was 7.4. 
With an expected Week 8 difference between treatment groups to be 2.5 points on the HAM-A
total scale, 372 subjects provide 90% power based on a 2-sample t-test with a common standard 
deviation of 7.4. The previous is based on an assumption of no premature discontinuations, if 
premature discontinuations occur at a rate of up to 25%, the power to detect a 2.5 point difference 
may be as low as 80%.
11.3 Populations for Analysis
The following analysis sets are defined for this protocol:
BHV4157-207; Clinical Protocol v02 Confidential
Troriluzole in Adult Subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder Page 68of 80
Draft Version 03; 01 Aug2019oEnrolled subjects: Patients who signed an informed consent form and were assigned a 
Patient Identification number (PID)
oRandomized subjects: Enrolled subjects who received a treatment assignment from the 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).
oTreated subjects: Enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of blinded study therapy 
(troriluzoleor placebo) or open-label troriluzole.
oModified Intent to Treat (mITT) subjects: Randomized subjects that received at least one 
dose of blinded study therapy and provided at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment 
during the randomization phase
11.4 Statistical Methods
11.4.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics will be made for all treated subjects. A 
separate set of tabulations will be made for subjects enrolled but not randomized.
Demographic information will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6654] (i.e., 
treatment groups combined).
11.4.2 Primary Endpoint(s)
As the primary objective of this study is based on the evaluation of severity of patients’ 
symptomology, the estimand for the primary endpoint will be the effect due to the initially 
randomized treatments if taken as directed, a de jure efficacy estimand.  The target population 
will be the mITT population. The primary endpoint will be the change from baseline in the HAM-
A score, troriluzolerelative to placebo, at Week [ADDRESS_906352] of the drug when taken as intended in 
the protocol, a hypothetical strategy will be employed for the intercurrent event of treatment/study 
discontinuation (due to any reason). Specifically, the assumption will be that had the subjects not 
discontinued, their efficacy would have been similar to the efficacy of subjects from the same 
treatment group who did not discontinue. For other intercurrent events that do not cause 
treatment/study discontinuation such as modest treatment non-compliance, protocol allowed dose 
adjustments, or initiation or adjustment of concomitant medications related to other symptoms all 
observed values will be used.
The change from baseline in the HAM-A score, will be analyzed using Mixed Model for 
Repeated Measures (MMRM).  The model will include treatment, visit and the treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed effects, and the baseline value of the HAM-A and baseline Ham-A by [CONTACT_653597]. The covariance structure will be initially specified as unstructured.  If 
the model fails to converge, then a Huynh-Feldt structure may beused, followed by [CONTACT_670871](1)

Draft Version 03; [ADDRESS_906353], with Kenwood-Rogers degrees of freedom, and 
significance assessed at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.  Sensitivity analyses will include, but not 
limited to a multiple imputation method employing a jump to reference method. Details of these 
analyses are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
Additional analyses on the HAM-A Scale will included analysis of the change from baseline 
Psychic Anxiety and Somatic Anxiety subscales as well as analyses of the percentage of HAM-A
responders and remitters.  Response is defined a a 50% or greater reduction in the HAM-A Total 
Score from baseline to endpoint.  Remission is defined as a HAM-A Total Score <= 7 at Weeks 6
and 8. Details of these analyses are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
11.4.3 Secondary and Exploratory Endpoint(s)
Continuous change-from-baseline efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the same 
methodology as the primary endpoint.  Further details on the secondary and exploratory analyses 
are provided in the SAP.
11.4.[ADDRESS_906354] is significant, then the secondary efficacyendpoints will be tested using 
Hochberg’s procedure.  If the test of the primary endpoint is not significant, then the unadjusted 
p-values for the secondary endpoints will be presented only for descriptive purposes, and no 
conclusions will be drawn from this result
No attempt will be made to adjust for multiplicity when testing the exploratory endpoints. Any 
exploratory endpoints subjected to significance testing are evaluated at an unadjusted two-sided 
alpha level of 0.05.
11.4.5 Missing Data
Studies similar to the randomized phase of this study showed ~25% of the subjects fail to 
complete the blinded randomized portion of the study[27][28]. Hence, we expect a similar rate of 
discontinuation during the randomized phase of this study. As part of sensitivity analyses for the 
primary and secondary endpoints, the missing data will be multiply imputed for the primary 
endpoint using reference methods (e.g. jump to reference). Further details on the handling of 
missing data, including for the SDS, are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
11.4.6 Analysis of Safety
The investigators determine the intensity of AEs and the relationship of AEs to study therapy. The 
investigators’ terms are coded and grouped by [CONTACT_670872] (MedDRA) available. AEs will be presented by

An independent Data Monitoring Committee(DMC) will be utilized for this study. The DMC 
will reviewthe safety of all patients enrolled in trials on an regularbasis. 
The DMC will review the protocol, and will identify the data parameters and format of the 
information to be regularly reported.  The DMC will meet in person or by [CONTACT_670875]. The DMC will typi[INVESTIGATOR_670819] 
(e.g. blinded group A, group B etc.) or, if requested by [CONTACT_1363], completely unblinded. 
Based on the review of safety data, the DMC will make recommendations regarding the conduct 
of the study to the clinical team. These may include continuing the study as designed, amending 
safety monitoring procedures, modifying the protocol or theinformed consent form, or 
recommending the termination of the study.  
For purposes of the DMC, dataanalysis will be carried out by [CONTACT_670876], and a report will be prepared for the DMC.
For further details please refer to the DMC charter.
12.[ADDRESS_906359]/Independent Ethics Committee
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of 
the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure (if any) and any 
other written information provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the 
Investigators have obtained the IEC favorable written approvals for the above-mentioned study 
documents. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_670877]. The original signed and dated ICF 
will be kept at the Investigator site and a copy will be given to the subject.
In the event that the protocol is amended, the revised protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_670878], unless the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the
trial. If a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must be 
obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_6179], prior to subsequently 
obtaining each subject’s consent.
The Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_670820]’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendments (if any) before initiating the study.
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs 
to regulatory authorities when necessary.

[CONTACT_1962], their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, 
potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to 
participate.
Biohaven (or designee) will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) 
sample informed consent form which will include all elements required by[CONTACT_12212], GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Before the potential subject has undergone any study-related screening procedures, the nature of 
thestudy and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the subject 
will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are 
answered, but before proceeding further, the subject must read and sign a written informed 
consent form. This signed informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, 
revisions to the protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC, a copy retained in the Study Master File, and the date and time the subject signed the 
form will be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a copy of his or her 
signed and dated informed consentform.
If informed consent is initially given by a patient’s legal guardi an or legally acceptable 
representative, and the patient subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating their 
informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the 
patient.
The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its representatives 
and regulatory authorities may have direct access to patient records.
The rights, safety, and well-being of study patients are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
A separate ICF will be obtained for the collection of blood for pharmacogenetic samples for 
possible future exploratory analysis investigating how genetic variation may determine troriluzole
efficacy and safety. All subjects will sign a pharmacogenomics ICF indicating whether they are 
consenting to or not consenting to provide a pharmacogenetic blood sample. All subjects will be 
informed that consenting to provide a blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis is optional and 
does not affe ct participation in the study. The investigator or the investigator’s designee is 
responsible for verifying the patient’s consent prior to obtaining the pharmacogenetic blood 
sample.
The approval of the pharmacogenetic ICF may occur separately from the consent form for other 
study related procedures and assessments. In instances were IRB approval for pharmacogenetics 
samples is not obtained, samples for genetic analysis will not be collected.

Title of Study:  Phase 3  study investigating the efficacy and safety of TAVT -45 (a biraterone 
acetate) Granules for Oral Suspension  (a novel a biraterone acetate formulation)  
relative to a reference abiraterone acetate formulation  in patients with 
metastatic  Castrate Sensitive Prostate Cancer ( mCSPC) and metastatic Castrate 
Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC)  
Principal 
Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_104189] -center study  
Study Center:  Multi -center study , including but not limited to, sites in US, Europe and other 
regions  
Development Phase:  Phase 3  
Primary Objectives:  
To establish therapeutic equivalence between TAVT -45 granules and Zytiga® tablets in patients with 
metastatic  castrate sensitive prostate cancer ( mCSPC ) and  metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer  
(mCRPC)   
Secondary Objective:  
To characterize the multiple- dose pharmacokinetic profile of TAVT -45 in a cohort of patients  
Study Design:  
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_925460] and safety profile 
of TAVT -45 compared to Zytiga (reference a biraterone acetate formulation, hereafter referred to as R -
AA) in patients with mCSPC and  mCRPC. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_683490] 
(CSPC  vs CRPC)  and baseline testosterone (<10 vs ≥ 10 ng/ dL). Patients will be treated for 84 days and 
randomized into one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio: 
• TAVT -45:  Administered twice daily as 1 x sachet containing TAVT -45 (250 mg abiraterone 
acetate)  + Prednisone (5 mg once or twice daily , depending on prostate cancer population)  
• R-AA:  Ad ministered once daily as  (2 x 500 mg Zytiga tablets) + Prednisone ( 5 mg once or 
twice daily , depending on prostate cancer population)  
Methodology:  
At Screening (up to [ADDRESS_925461] dosing) , all eligible patients  will provide written informed 
consent to participate in the study before any protocol -specified procedures or assessments are initiated .  
Upon meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria s et forth in the protocol, patients will be randomized in a 
1:1 fashion to receive either TAVT -45 (250 mg abiraterone acetate)  twice daily (approximately every 12 
hours)  without respect to food or R-AA 1000 mg once daily either ≥ 1 hour before or ≥ 2 hours after a 
meal . All patients should also receive prednisone together with a gonadotropin- releasing hormone  
(GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy . The m CSPC  patients will receive 
prednisone 5 mg orally once daily, while the mCRPC patients will receive prednisone 5 mg orally twice  
daily .  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_683490] (CSPC vs CRPC) and baseline 
testosterone (<10 vs ≥ 10 ng/ dL).  
Patients will return to the clinic in the morning  on Days 9, 10, 28, 56 and 84 for assessments and 
evaluations  of safety and efficacy, including testosterone, PSA, and abiraterone  trough samples .  Patients 
may return to the clinic or may visit a local laboratory for evaluation of liver function tests on Days 42 
and 70 .  Blood samples for testosterone will be taken between the hours of 7 :00-10:[ADDRESS_925462] 2020 -005611 -46 Page 15

 Pharmacokinetic Assessments:  
In a cohort of up to 8 patients randomized to TAVT -45, blood samples (approximately 4 mL each) for 
PK analysis will be collected at the following times on Day 1 and Day 9: pre -dose (time 0) and  0.25, 
0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, and [ADDRESS_925472] -dose and before the scheduled evening dose .   
Safety A ssessments:  
Safety assessments will include : 
• Vital sign s 
• Physical examinations  
• Adverse events (AEs)  
• Clinical laboratory assessments  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the comparison of the average of serum testosterone levels on days 9 
and 10 between groups ( TAVT -45 vs R- AA). 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint  is the PSA -50 response, defined as a decrease of ≥  50% in PSA 
levels from baseline  at any time over the 84-day post- treatment period . 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• Serum testosterone levels at Day s 28, 56 and 84 
• PSA-50 response at Days 28, 56 and 84 
• PSA levels at Day s 28, 56 and 84 
• Trough concentrations of abiraterone  at Day s 9, 28, 56 and 84 
 
Safety:  Safety endpoints include incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), and clinically 
relevant changes in vital signs and laboratory assessments.  
 
Pharmacokinetics :  For a cohort of up to 8 patients randomized to TAVT -45 and participating in the 
serial PK sampling on Day 1 and Day 9, the following PK parameters will be determined:  
• Area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to [ADDRESS_925473] dose ( AUC 0-12)  
• Maximum measured plasma concentration (C max)  
• Minimum measured plasma concentration (C min)  
• Time to maximum measured concentration (t max)  
• Accumulation ratio (Rac) 
• Effective half -life (t ½) 
Statistical Methods: The effects of TAVT -45 250 mg BID on serum testosterone will be  compared to 
R-AA ( 1000 mg QD) based on the equivalence approach of 80% to 125% confidence interval (CI) of the 
test-to-reference geometric mean ratio. Under the assumptions of a coefficient of variation of 25%, a 
lower and upper limit of 80% to 125%, and an expected test -to-reference ratio of 1. 05, 108 patients  in 
total ( 54 patients in TAVT -45 and 54 patients in R -AA) will provide o ver 80% power (two one -sided t -
tests at 0.05 level) to conclude therapeutic equivalence of TAVT -45 to R- AA. 
The primary endpoint, the average serum testosterone levels on days 9 and 10, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_683491]  (ANOVA) model with treatment as a factor. The test -to-reference geometric mean 
ratio effect and its 90% confidence interval (CI) of TAVT -45 to R-AA will be compared to 80% to 125%  
limit [1,2] . The primary analysis will be performed on the mCRPC intent- to-treat (CR-ITT)  population 
and repeated on the ITT and per-protocol populations . Primary analysis will also be repeated on CSPC 
patients. Differen t missing data imputation approaches will be used as sensitivity analyses based on the 
intent- to-treat population.  If the equ ivalence of the average of serum testosterone levels on days 9 and 
10 is achieved, th en the key secondary endpoint  (PSA-50 response) will be tested at 0.[ADDRESS_925474] one dose of study drug. Treatment -emergent 
AEs, along with the number and percentage of patients with abnormal or potentially clinically significant 
clinical laboratory values and vital sign measurements , will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Hypothesis 
testing, unless otherwise indica ted, will be  performed at the 5% significance level.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background  
Abiraterone acetate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_683478], a selective, irreversible inhibitor 
of cytochrome P450 17α (17α-hydroxylase/C17- 20 lyase; CYP17), an enzyme that is key in the 
production of androgens in all sites, including the testes and adrenal glands. CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119] (DHEA)  and androstenedione  [3,4]. Inhibition of this  biochemical 
process results in dec reased proliferation of androgen sensitive castration -resistant prostate cancer 
(CRPC)  cell lines and slower disease progression in patients. 
Abiraterone acetate is indicated for the treatment of metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC)  and metastatic high -risk castration -sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) , in combination 
with prednisone  in the US and in combination with either prednisone or prednisolone  in Europe . 
Abiraterone acetate is currently marketed under the trade name [CONTACT_683520] -coated tablets 
containing 500 mg a biraterone acetate and as uncoated tablets containing 250 mg. The 
recommended dose for Zytiga is 1000 mg orally once daily, together  with 
prednisone /prednisolone  (5 mg orally twice daily for m CRPC patients; and 5 mg orally once daily  
for high- risk CSPC patients). Patients receiving Zytiga  should also receive a gonadotropin-
releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy  [3,4]. 
Abiraterone acetate has been  shown to be safe and effective in both the  CRPC and high- risk CSPC 
populations  with dista nt metastases (M1, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
[AJCC] tumor, node, metastasis [TMN] system ). Of note, a biraterone acetate is also recommended 
as Category 1 evidence by [CONTACT_68015] ( NCCN ) as first -line 
treatments for both populations ( i.e., nodal  metastas es [N+M0]). 
Administration of Zytiga with food, compared with administration in a fasted state, results in up to a 10- fold (AUC) and up to a 17- fold (C
max) increase in mean systemic exposure of abiraterone, 
depending on the fat content of the meal. Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals, taking Zytiga with meals has the potential to result in highly variable exposures. Therefore, Zytiga must not be taken with food. It should be taken at least two hours after eating and no food should be eaten for at  least one hour after taking Zytiga. The 10- fold food 
effect observed also shows that the oral bioavailability of abiraterone is below 10% when Zytiga is administered in the fasted state.  Inter -subject variability has been shown to be approximately 
79% for C
max and 64% for AUC 0-[ADDRESS_925475] ~20% to 40% of cancer

evaluated in this study is identified as TAVT -45.  
Initially , a powder -in-bottle ( PiB) formulation with 50 mg abiraterone acetate per bottle  strength 
was developed and tested in both non- clinical  studies and a Phase 1 clinical  trial. Since the 
production of the PiB formulation at industrial scale is not viable and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_683479], DRGT -45 tablet s for oral suspension (with 62.5 mg

scale or d istributed for use outside of a controlled clinical setting . To address the tablet friability 
issue, the tablet manufacturing process was modified to deliver a granule form (TAVT -45) which 
had an  identical formulation  composition but was a granule  in place of a tablet. The granules  are 
packaged in a sachet  as the primary packaging which is composed of the same material used in 
primary packaging of the tablets. Characterization studies were performed to confirm that the reconstitution properties (ti me and reconstitution method) of the granules  were comparable to that 
of the tablets  and also that the properties of the reconstituted granules  in water and fruit juice were 
equivalent in terms of homogeneity and stability compared to that obtained when re constituting 
the tablets in water .  The granule  formulation of 
TAVT -45 will be used in this study.  
1.3.1  Nonclinical s tudies  
The non- clinical aspects of abiraterone acetate are well documented [ 3,4]. Bridging studies , 
however, using DRGT -[ADDRESS_925479] been assessed 
in vitro . The aim of the non- clinical investigation was to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of 
the novel formulations using in vitro dissolution and permeability measurements along with in vivo pharmacokinetic investigations in beagle dogs  for the DRGT -45 tablet for oral suspension.   
Since the formulation  composition of the DRGT -45 tablet and TAVT -45 granules  are the same 
and the in vitro dissolution and properties of the reconstituted products  are comparable, the in 
vivo pharmacokinetic investigation in vivo has not been repeated for the TAVT -45 granules.

 1.3.2  Clinical studies  
Abiraterone acetate has been investigated extensively as Zytiga  in healthy volunteers and patients  
[3, 4]; further clinical study results are available in the Investigator’s  Brochure [ 8], and are 
discussed below.  
There has been one clinical study conducted with the DRGT -45 PiB formulation , and one clinical 
study with this DRGT -45 tablet for oral suspension formulation, which are both briefly discussed 
below  in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Zytiga p harmacokinetics and metabol ism  
Following administration of Zytiga, the PK of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate have been 
studied in healthy subjects, patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer and subjects without cancer with hepatic or renal impairment. Abiraterone acetate is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_683478], an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor.  
Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate in the fasting state, the time to reach 
maximum plasma abiraterone concentration is approximately 2 h ours. No major deviatio n from 
dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 to 1000 mg. Steady state is achieved 
within eight days following once -daily dosing of 1000 mg, with approximately 2- fold higher 
exposure at steady state (steady state AUC) compared to when t he same dose is administered as a 
single dose. Inter -subject variability has been shown to be approximately 79% for C
max and 64% 
for AUC 0-24 after multiple day dosing.  
Following oral administration of 14C-abiraterone acetate as capsules, abiraterone acetate is 
hydrolysed to abiraterone, which then undergoes metabolism including sulphation, hydroxylation and oxidation primarily in the liver. The majority of circulating radioactivity (approximately 92%) 
is found in the form of metabolites of abiraterone. Approximately 88% of the radioactive dose is 
recovered in faeces and approximately 5% in urine . 
Administration of abiraterone acetate with food, compared with administration in a fasted state, results in up to a 10-fold (AUC) and up to a 17- fold (C
max) increase in mean systemic exposure of 
abiraterone, depending on the fat content of the meal. Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals, taking Zytiga with meals has the potential to resul t in highly variable 
exposures. The mean half -life of abiraterone in plasma is approximately 15 h based on data from 
healthy subjects.  
The plasma protein binding of 
14C-abiraterone in human plasma is 99.8%. The apparent volume 
of distribution is approximat ely 5630 L suggesting that abiraterone extensively distributes to 
peripheral tissues [ 4]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Zytiga  clinical efficacy and safety  
Zytiga  decreases serum testosterone and other androgens to levels lower than those achieved by 
[CONTACT_683492]- releasing hormone ( GnRH) analogues alone or by [CONTACT_279197]. This 
results from the selective inhibition of the CYP17 enzyme required for androgen biosynthesis . 
The key studies wi th Zytiga include two randomized placebo- controlled, multicenter Phase 3  trials 
in patients with metastatic CRPC (COU -AA-301 and COU -AA-302) and one randomized 
placebo -controlled, multicenter Phase 3  trial (LATITUDE) in patients who had metastatic high -
risk CSPC [ 9,10,11]. In these trials, Z ytiga  was administered orally at a dose of 1,000 mg daily in 
combination with prednisone 5 mg (twice daily for m CRPC patients and once daily for high- risk 
CSPC) , and added to standard androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) , consisting of either a 
gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or prior orchiectomy.  In the m CRPC patients ,

 overall survival was prolonged in the Zytiga –prednisone group compared to th e placebo –
prednisone group in both patients who previously received chemotherapy  [9] and those who were 
chemotherapy naïve [ 10]. Similarly, in patients with metastatic high -risk C SPC, addition of 
Zytiga -prednisone to ADT significantly increased overall survival and radiographic progression-
free survival in men with newly diagnosed, metastatic, CSPC [ 11]. These studies also 
demonstrated that Zytiga was well tolerated. Most t oxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2, 
with a low  rate of drug discontinuation or dose reduction and were largely mechanism -based and 
secondary to mineralocorticoid excess resulting from blockade of CYP17. The common adverse 
events (≥1%) resulting in di scontinuation of Zytiga -prednisone were hepatotoxicity and cardiac 
disorder .  
The current NCCN guidelines for treatment of prostate cancer also recommends Zytiga  usage in 
high- risk CSPC patients  with nodal metastases ( N+ M0). This is based, in part, on the findings 
from the STAMPEDE trial, which  demonstrated that adding abiraterone leads to an increased life 
expectancy and improvement in disease control in newly diagnosed metastatic or node -positive 
disease [ 12]. 
An additional observational study show ed that abiraterone trough concentration correlates with 
PSA response and progression- free survival ( PFS). Moreover, a cut -off value for  plasmatic 
concentration (8.4 ng/mL) was determined for PSA response  [13]. These data show that t here is a 
relationship between steady state abiraterone trough concentrations , primary treatment resistance, 
and efficacy response ( PSA and P FS). Of note, since Zytiga exhibits highly variable PK , low 
plasma abiraterone concentrations are not infrequent. This highlights a major limitation for Zytiga.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  TAVT -[ADDRESS_925480] crossover study in 11 healthy male subjects , whereby 
[CONTACT_683493] -45 PiB was dosed at 100 mg and 200 mg doses in the fasted state and at 200 mg dose in 
the fed state, with a minimum washout period between doses of 7 days.  Following the administration of DRGT -45 PiB, the mean abiraterone plasma concentrations increased r api[INVESTIGATOR_683480] a biphasic manner. Mean T
max occurred within 1 hour regardless of the dose 
or prandial status. For the 200 mg dose, abiraterone was detectable in plasma for up to 72 hours (> 0.2 ng/ml), while for the 100 mg dose it was detec table for up to 48 hours. The calculated PK  
parameters were compared to literature data available across multiple studies for 1,000 mg Zytiga [14]. Following the admi nistration of 100 mg PiB in the fasted state, C
max and AUC were 88% 
and 33% of that following the administration of 1,000 mg Zytiga, respectively. At the 200 mg dose in the fasted state, C
max exceeded that of 1,000 mg Zytiga by [CONTACT_46431] 2 -fold, while AUC was 
81% of the 1,[ADDRESS_925481] variability (expressed as CV%) was also reduced from 59% 
(Zytiga) to 38% (100 mg dose) and 29% (200 mg dose). Food slightly delayed a bsorption and 
reduced the AUC by 26%. The terminal elimination half -life was similar to that reported for 
Zytiga  [3, 14]. There were no serious adverse events (SAEs) or deaths reported during this study. 
All AEs were assessed as mild and unrelated to study drug. The most common TEAEs reported by [CONTACT_2669] 2 subj ects were musculoskeletal pain (back/joints) and headache. Other TEAEs 
reported were nasopharyngitis, blood creatine phosphokinase and transaminase increase. There were no other clinically significant changes reported in hematological, clinical chemistry o r 
urinalysis laboratory values, vital signs measurements, physical examinations, or 12- lead ECGs.

 trial to evaluate the PK and safety of single doses of DRGT -45 tablets for oral suspension (Part 1; 
doses of 62.5 to 250 mg  in 12 healthy adult males) and to compare the oral bioavailability of 
DRGT -45 (250 mg)  and R -AA (1000 mg)  under f ed and modified fasting c onditions (Part 2; in 
20 healthy adult males).  
Part 1:   Following single oral administration of DRGT -[ADDRESS_925483], and AUC 0-∞, 
respectively. The geometric mean plasma half -life of abiraterone was 10.379 h for the 62.5 mg 
dose level and increased to range from 14.045 to 15.038 h at the 125, 187.5 and 250 mg dose 
levels which was si milar to those observed previously, and likely the result of better definition of 
the terminal portion of the curve at higher doses (median T last increased from 24 h at the 62.5 mg 
dose level to 71 h at the 187.5 and 250 mg dose levels).  
Single oral doses  of DRGT -45 up to 250 mg in the fasted state were well tolerated and there were 
no deaths during the study. Six (50.0%) subjects reported a total of [ADDRESS_925484] had an unrelated SAE that that was of moderate severity and led to withdrawal from the study (buttock abscess). One subject was withdrawn due to maculopapular rash that was mild in severity and considered possibly related to DRGT -45. 
There were no significant clinical laboratory, vital signs or ECG results. 
 
Part 2:  Administration of DRGT -[ADDRESS_925485] showed a statistically 
significant reduction of 59.61%, 24.88% and 24.74% in C max, AUC 0-last and AUC 0-∞ of 
abiraterone, respectively, compared to the fasted state. Median T max was unchanged in t he fed 
state compared with the fasted state at 0.[ADDRESS_925486] (modified  fasting 
conditions) showed a delay of 1.[ADDRESS_925487] and AUC 0-∞ values were 782%, 650% and 642% higher in the modified fasted state than 
the fasted state. Elimination of abiraterone was similar in the fed state to the fasted state, with geometric mean terminal half -life of 13.829 hours. 
Following administration of 250 mg DRGT -45 in the fed state, exposure was approximately 
equivalent to or moderately higher than that of 1000 mg R -AA in the fasted state, with C
max 
bioavailability of 121.11% and AUC 0-last and AUC 0-∞ bioavailability of 91.24% and 90.46%, 
respectively. Conversely, when compared to that of 1000 mg R -AA dosed in the modified fasted 
state, representing an upper safety limit for the exposure range, exposure levels were notably less than the reference regimen (relative bioavailabilities of 15.47%, 14.00% and 14.10% for C
max, 
AUC 0-last and AUC 0-∞, respectively) indicating that fed dosing did not represent any exposure 
driven safety concerns.  
Although administration of DRGT -[ADDRESS_925488] 2020 -005611 -46 Page 25 
TAVT45C02  
 
 Tavanta Therapeutics , Inc.  
Protocol Version 3.0   
 conclusions can be drawn for 250 mg DRGT -45 dosed in the fasted state when comparing to the 
reference Zytiga regimens. Comparisons to 1000 mg R -AA in the fasted state indicated increased 
abiraterone exposure for the DRGT -45 regimen with relative bioavailabilities of 299.83%, 
121.46% and 120.19% for C max, AUC 0-last and AUC 0-∞, respectively. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_683481], abiratero ne exposure levels following fasted DRGT -45 dosing (relative bioavailabilities of 
59.61%, 24.88% and 24.74% for C max, AUC 0-last and AUC 0-∞, respectively, when compared with 
fed dosing) were also notably less than that observed for R -AA dosed in the modifie d fasted state. 
The notable gap that exists between DRGT exposure, regardless of prandial state dosed, and the 
upper end of Zytiga exposure, highlights there exists a wide safety related exposure margin for future increases in DRGT -45 dose or modification in dose regimens (e.g., BID dosing).  
Additionally, DRGT -45 dosing was associated with lower  variability than for R -AA, regardless 
of prandial status  (CV% for C
max was 48.0- 60.4% vs 58.6- 72.3% , respectively ; and CV% for 
AUC 0-∞ was 44.0- 45.1% vs 5 5-56.3%).  
Single oral doses of 250 mg DRGT -45 and 1000 mg R -AA administered in the fed and fasted 
state were well tolerated in healthy male subjects and the incidence and nature of AEs was similar after dosing with DRGT -45 and R -AA. The incidence of AEs was low across all dosing regimens 
and the majority of AEs were both mild in severity and unrelated to IMP. Twelve (60.0%) subjects reported [ADDRESS_925489] and the highly variable nature of abiraterone PK  
after dosing with Zytiga  results in known efficacy and potential safety issues. As noted above, i t 
has been shown that patients who exhibited primary resistance to 1,000 mg Zytiga  had lower 
plasma  abiraterone concentrations when compared to responders  [13]. Therefore, TAVT -[ADDRESS_925490] an abiraterone acetate formulation with improved oral bioavailability , 
and thus the highly variable nature of abirat erone exposure seen after Zytiga dosing is expected 
to be reduced  with TAVT -45 dosing. This may result in a greater proportion of patients having 
abiraterone trough concentrations exceeding the 8.4 ng/mL threshold after TAVT -[ADDRESS_925491] ~20% to 40% of cancer patients and can impact compliance  to prescribed medications due to difficulty swallowing pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  [5,6,7] .

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study is t o establish therapeutic equivalence between TAVT -45 
granules and Zytiga  tablets , hereafter referred to as reference abiraterone acetate (R-AA), in 
patients with m CSPC and m CRPC. 
2.2 Secondary objective 
The secondary objective of this study is t o characterize the multiple -dose pharmacokinetic profile 
of TAVT -45 in a cohort of patients. 
2.3 Endpoints 
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the comparison of the average of serum testosterone levels on 
days 9 and 10 between groups ( TAVT -45 vs R- AA).  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint  is the PSA -50 response, defined as a decrease of ≥  50% in 
PSA levels from baseline  at any time over the 84-day post- treatment period . 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
• Serum testosterone levels at Day s 28, 56 and 84 
• PSA-50 response at Days 28, 56 and 84 
• PSA levels at Day s 28, 56 and 84 
• Trough concentrations of abiraterone at Days 9, 28, 56 and 84 
Safety:   
Safety endpoints include incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE), and clinically relevant changes in vital signs and laboratory assessments. 
For more details on study endpoints, see Section 9. 
Pharmacokinetics:  
For a cohort of up to 8 patients randomized to TAVT -45 and participating in the  serial PK 
sampling on Day 1 and Day 9, the following PK parameters will be determined: 
• Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to [ADDRESS_925492] dose (AUC 0-12)  
• Maximum measured plasma concentration (C max)  
• Minimum measured plasma concentrat ion (C min)  
• Time to maximum measured concentration (t max)  
• Accumulation ratio (Rac)  
• Effective half -life (t½)

It is planned to enroll 108 patients in this study  (n=54 patients per prostate cancer population),

approved dosing of once daily R -AA (i.e., 1000 mg QD), as discussed below, it is not possible to 
directly compare the PK profile between these two agents using a tradi tional bioequivalence of 
Cmax and AUC.  Therefore, this study aims to establish therapeutic equivalence of clinical efficacy 
and safety.  
This study will evaluate serum testosterone levels after treatment with TAVT -[ADDRESS_925495] 2020 -005611 -46 Page 28

 originator/prototype agents . Using serum testosterone as the primary endpoint for clinical 
equivalence is  also consistent with the study design used in the STAAR study, which was a 
randomized phase 2 therapeutic equivalence study of abiraterone acetate fine particle formulatio n 
(Yonsa®)  vs. originator abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) in patients with m CRPC [ 15]. Like the 
STAAR study, this study will also assess serum testosterone on Days 9 and 10 of treatment, which 
aligns with the expected attainment of steady state a biraterone  plasma concentrations. The safety 
and tolerability profiles will also be examined, togethe r with other measures of efficacy, including 
PSA, which is the key secondary efficacy endpoint that will provide further supportive evidence 
of the clinical similarity between TAVT -45 and R -AA. 
The two study populations, mCRPC and m CSPC , will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ensure 
balance of the populations across the two treatment groups.  Likewise,  randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_683494] (< 10 and ≥ 10 ng/ dL) to ensure balance in each treatment 
arm.  The testosterone str atification threshold of 10 ng/ dL was selected considering the baseline 
levels report ed in the STA AR study for the  patients with mCRPC  [15] as well as average 
testosterone values observed following bilateral orchiectomy [ 16]. 
3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of  
treatment  
The dose level of R -AA for this study is [ADDRESS_925496] approved dose 
level [ 3].  
The dose level of TAVT -45 will be 250 mg BID , which corresponds to a total daily dose of 
500 mg. Selection  of this dosing regimen is supported by [CONTACT_683495] 1 PK 
study DRGT45C03 (see also Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details) . One of the aims of Part [ADDRESS_925497] PK bioequivalent or higher than the lower limit (i.e, 
1000 mg R -AA under fasted conditions) and at most PK bioequivalent or lower than the upper 
limit (i.e., 1000 mg R-AA und er modified fasted conditions). Key findings are summarized below:  
• Lower Limit:  Following administration of 250 mg DRGT -45 in the fed state, peak 
exposure (C max) was approximately equivalent to or moderately higher than that of 
1000 mg R -AA in the fasted state, while overall exposure (AUC 0-last and AUC 0-∞) was 
approximately equivalent to or moderately lower. Similar findings were observed following 250 mg DRGT -45 in the fasted state, whereby [CONTACT_683496] 1000 mg R -AA in the  fasted state and overall exposure was equivalent to or greater.  
• Upper Limit:  When compared to that of 1000 mg R -AA dosed in the modified fasted state, 
representing an upper safety limit for the exposure range, both peak and overall exposure levels after D RGT -45 dosing were notably less than the reference regimen (relative 
bioavailabilities for C
max and AUC ranged from approximately 14- 38%). The gap that 
exists between DRGT -45 exposure, regardless of prandial state dosed, and the upper end 
of Zytiga exposur e, highlights that there is a wide safety- related exposure margin for future 
increases in DRGT -45 dose or modification in dose regimens (e.g., BID dosing). 
• Simulations of BID Dosing:  Simulation of repeat ed dosing w as also performed based on 
the single dose  PK data. The predicted plasma concentrations and exposures after dosing 
with DRGT -[ADDRESS_925498] -dose, Cmax is predicted 
to be only slightly increased in steady state (5 -10%) for DRGT -[ADDRESS_925499] 2020 -005611 -46 Page 29

Protocol Version 3.0   
 In the study described herein, R-AA will be administered orally  either ≥ 1 hour before or ≥ [ADDRESS_925500] to food with the exception of dose 
administration in the pharmacokinetic sub- study.  Patients participating in the serial blood draws 
on Days 1 and 9 will administer TAVT -45 in the fasted state  (minimum of [ADDRESS_925501])  on these days  
and may resume normal meal schedules 2 h af ter administration of the TAVT -45. 
The duration of treatment in this study will be 84 days  (12 weeks) . This is equivalent to three 
28-day cycles , and consistent with the STAAR study that also compared a novel abiraterone 
formulation to R -AA [15]. Moreover, 12 weeks is a time point that is historically used in many 
metastatic CRPC studies as a landmark for measuring response to therapy; for example, PSA 
responses at 12 weeks was a statistically significant factor associated with survival in a 
multivariate analysis using a prognostic model applied to multiple clinical trials [ 17,18].  
For the dose selection and timing of the concomitant prednisone, see Section 3.5.  
3.4  Formulation to be used  
This study will use TAVT -45 and R -AA (which is the reference abiraterone acetate currently 
marketed under the trade name [CONTACT_683521]).  
Abiraterone acetate is the acetyl ester of abiraterone, which is an inhibitor of CYP17.  The 
chemical designation is 3β -acetoxy -17-(3-pyridyl) -androsta -5,16-diene .  It is a white to off -white 
powder practically insoluble in aqueous media (pH range 2.0 to 12.9), very slightly soluble in

 3.5 Rationale for choice of additional treatment  
In addition to the TAVT -45 or R -AA treatments, all patients in this study will also receive 
prednisone during the treatment period. Specifically, 5 mg prednisone will be administered orally 
twice daily for m CRPC patients, and 5 mg prednisone orally once daily will be administered fo r 
mCSPC patients.  
This requirement for co -adminstration of prednisone (including the dose level and frequency for 
mCRPC and m CSPC patients ) is consistent with the on -label dosing requirements on R -AA. 
Abiraterone is a CYP17A1 inhibitor , and one of the side  effects of CYP17A1 inhibition is a 
decrease in cortisol levels . This leads to a compensatory increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone 
(ACTH), and an accumulation of steroids with mineralocorticoid properties.  Glucocorticoids, 
such as prednisone , can suppr ess ACTH secretion from the anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_683483] -related side effects  (e.g., hypokalemia, hypertension, and fluid retention ).   
As part of the standard ADT  background, all patients in this study must also be receiving a GnRH 
analog concurrently if they have not had a bilateral orchiectomy.  ADT background will be 
recorded in the CRF.  Patients receiving a GnRH analog will record administration in a diary to allow assessment of compliance with ADT therapy.  
3.6 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations  
Not applicable as there are no plans for conducting an interim analysis.   
3.7 Risks and benefits  
Since R -AA is already approved by [CONTACT_683497], and TAVT -45 contains the same active ingredient (abiraterone acetate), it is expected 
that patients will benefit from these treatments. Additional potential benefits of TAVT -45 over 
R-AA are described in Section 1.4, and may include less  variability of exposure, no requirement 
to take the drug on an empty stomach, and an alternative choice for patients with dysphagia or aversion to swallowing large pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. 
There is considerable data available on the adverse effects associated with abiraterone acetate 
from placebo -controlled clinical trials (comprising  over 2000 patients from the Zytiga clinical 
program) ; full details are available in the Zytiga  SmPC [ 4]. 
Based on pooled safety analyses of multiple clinical trials [ 3,4], t he most common adverse  
reactions  (≥10%) that occurred more commonly (>2%) in Zytiga treatment arm compared to 
placebo were fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, 
vomiting, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], cough, and headache.  The most common laboratory 
abnormalities (>20%) that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the  Zytiga  arm were anemia, 
elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hyper cholesterolemia, 
hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Grades 3- 4 adverse events were reported for 53% of patients in 
the Zytiga arm and 46% of patients in the placebo arm.  Treatment discontinuation was reported 
in 14% of patients  in the Zytiga arm and 13% of p atients in the placebo arm.  The common adverse 
events (≥1%) resulting in discontinuation of Zytiga  and prednisone were hepatotoxicity and 
cardiac disorder . 
Since TAVT -45 also contains abiraterone acetate as the active ingredient, any adverse reactions 
and their incidences are expected to be similar to those reported for Zytiga.

• General COVID -19 Related -Risk Mitigation Measures: 
o Tavanta and the clinical CRO ( TMC ) will work with clinical sites to document 
site-level procedures regarding COVID -related precautions for patients and staff 
(such as personal protective devices of face coverings, masks,  shields , temperature 
screening, and social distancing procedures).  T he study visit schedule has also 
been carefully reviewed to minimize unnecessary visits and patient exposure. 
o Tavanta and TMC will continue to assess risk during the course of the clinical 
study  due to COVID -[ADDRESS_925504]. This includes risk assessment for the overall 
study, as well as at the country/regional levels since changes/adaptations may be needed at a local level depending on the local COVID -19 situation. This may 
include impacts on visit sc hedules, assessments performed in -person or virtually, 
and alternative options for IMP re -supply for patients. T avanta and TMC will also 
communicate as needed with IRB/IEC and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) staff.  The risk mitigation measures, where appl icable, will be amended based on 
emerging government guidances.

preparation and administration. At visits when trough abiraterone samples are obtained (see Table 
1), the reconstitution fluid (water or juice) used for the last dose will be recorded in the eCRF.  
For R -AA, t ablets should be  taken once daily, either ≥ 1 hour before or ≥ 2 hours after a meal , and  
swallowed  whole with water . For a 1000 mg dose, 2 tablets (containing 500 mg abiraterone 
acetate) should be taken together.  
Patients will be instructed to record administration of study medications  in a dosing diary.  This 
is inclusive of TAVT -45, R -AA, prednisone and GnRH  analog, if applicable.  The patient will  
record the date and time of each administration of each medication .  For TAVT -45, the patient 
will also record the fluid (water or specified juice) used for reconstitution. 
The investigator should promote compliance by [CONTACT_683501] e study visits as 
scheduled and by [CONTACT_373504] ’s safety and the validity of 
the study. The patient  should be instructed to contact  [CONTACT_683502] a study visit as scheduled.  
5.6.5  Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study  treatment  
There will not be any planned permitted adjustments of dose strength and frequency.  Patients 
should take TAVT -45 and R -AA as per protocol.  
However, if needed due to adverse events, study medication may be temporarily or permanently 
discontinued at the discretion  of the Investigator  based on the  toxicity management guidance 
described below related to hepatotoxicity and Grade ≥ 3 toxicities , which align s with Zytiga 
prescribing information [ 3, 4]. Investigators should consult with the Medical Monitor for 
questions /clarifications as needed.

Protocol Version 3.0   
 above, dose reductions are not applicable for this clinical trial, as only one strength of each 
study medication (TAVT -45 and R -AA) are supplied to patients. L iver function should be  
closely monitored as part of adverse event monitoring. 
• Grade ≥ 3 toxicities of hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema and other non-mineralocorticoid toxicities:  If at any time during the trial, a patient experiences Grade ≥ 
3  hypertension, hypokalaemia, oedema or  other non- mineralocorticoid toxicities  
(according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events [CTCAE], Version 5.0 [20]), treatment should be withheld and appropriate medical 
management should be instituted. Treatment with TAVT -[ADDRESS_925522] had bilateral orchiectomy. 
Bisphosphonate usage is allowed only if patients are on the medication at a stable dose and 
regimen for 4 weeks  prior to Study Day 1 (see E xclusion C riteri on #3) . 
The investigator should instruct the patient  to notify the study site about any new medications 
over-the-counter drugs, supplements, and vitamins administered after the patient  is enrolled into 
the study. All medications (other than study treatment), procedures and significant non- drug 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) must be recorded on the CRF. The 
reason, name [CONTACT_18467], procedure or non- drug therapy should be listed.  
Since androgen deprivation treatment may prolong the QT interval, caution is advised when 
administering abiraterone acetate with medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval or 
medicinal products able to induce torsades de pointes such as class IA (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) antiarrhythmic medicinal products, methadone, moxifloxacin, antipsychotics, etc.

Cytochrome P450 inducers  
In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co -administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, 
decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55%. This reduced exposure can be anticipated to decrease 
the efficacy of abiraterone. Thus, concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided during abiraterone treatment. Notable examples of strong CYP3A4 inducers are apalutamide, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  enzalutamide, mitotane, phenobarbital , phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513],

[IP_ADDRESS]  Effects of abiraterone acetate on other medicinal products  
CYP2D6 Substrate  
Abiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug- metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6.  In a CYP2D6 
drug- drug interaction trial, the C
max and AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were 
increased 2.8 - and 2.9- fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone 
acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co- administration of abiraterone 
acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine).  If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug.  
CYP2 C8 Substrate  
Abiraterone is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug- metabolizing enzyme CYP2 C8.  In a CYP2C 8 
drug- drug interaction trial, the AUC of pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% 
when pi[INVESTIGATOR_97079] a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate.  
Ther efore, patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate 
with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with abiraterone.  Investiga tors may consult 
with the M edical Monitor for identification of CYP2C8 substrates with narrow therapeutic index.   
5.6.9  
Discontinuation of study treatment  
Patient s may voluntarily discontinue study treatment or the study for any reason at any time. The 
investigator should discontinue study treatment for a patient  if, on balance, he/she believes that 
continuation would be detrimental to that patient ’s well-being. Study treatment must be 
discontinued under the following circumstances:  
• Withdrawal of informed  consent  
• Patient ’s request to terminate  treatment  (in this case, the patient may choose to discontinue 
study treatment, but remain in the study to be followed for safety and undergo study procedures through the follow -up period)

If patient s refuse to return for these assessments or are unable to do so, every effort should be 
made to contact [CONTACT_18622] a knowledgeable informant by [CONTACT_683506]. 
Attempts to contact [CONTACT_683507]. 
Screening will be flexible in duration of up to [ADDRESS_925528] dosing, during which time the 
patient  will sign the informed consent form (ICF)  to participate in the study before any protocol -
specified procedures or assessments are initiated . Patients  evaluated at screening for eligibility 
should not be screen failed on the basis of a medication requiring washout, unless the patient will be unable to complete the washout in the appropriate time frame before randomization.  Upon meeting all inclusion/ex clusion criteria set forth in the protocol, patients will be randomized in a 
1:1 fashion to receive either TAVT -45 250 mg twice daily  (approximately every 12 hours) or 
R-AA 1000 mg once daily either ≥ 1 hour before or ≥ 2 hours after a meal. All patients s hould 
also receive prednisone together with a gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) analog 
concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy. The  mCSPC patients will receive 
prednisone 5 mg orally once daily, while the m CRPC patients will receive predn isone 5 mg orally 
twice daily.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_683490] (CSPC vs CRPC) and 
baseline testosterone (<10 vs ≥ 10 ng/ dL). All patients will be treated for 84 days (12 weeks) .  
Patients will return to their clinics on Days  9, 10, 28, 56 and 84 for assessments and evaluations 
of safety and efficacy, including testosterone , PSA, and abiraterone trough concentrations . 
Patients  may return to the clinic or may visit a local laboratory for evaluation of liver function 
tests on Da ys 42 and 70.  Blood samples for testosterone will be taken between the hours of 7- 10 
in the morning. A pharmacokinetic sub- study will be conducted in a cohort of up to 8 patients 
receiving TAVT -45. Pharmacokinetic profiles  over the dosing interval  will be obtained on Day 1 
(first dose) and on Day 9 ( steady state ).  For all patients, a  follow -up phone call will also be made 
approximately one week after the last dose for AE assessments .

EudraCT [ADDRESS_925532] demographics/other baseline  characteristics  
Patient  demographic , baseline characteristic , and medical history data must be collected on all 
patient s and recorded in the CRF. Also, medical history relevant to prostate cancer (s uch as date 
of diagnosis  and Gleason score ) should also be recorded. Whenever possible, diagnoses and not 
symptoms will be recorded. Investigators will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings 
on the medical history CRF whenever in their judgment. 
 
6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance  
All dates of study treatment dispensing will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Drugs 
administered prior to start of treatment and other drugs/procedures continuing or started during 
the study treatment period will be entered in the Prior/Concomitant medications  CRF.   
Compliance (adherence) is expected to be 100% . During each Treatment Period, the number of 
granule sachets or tablets dispensed and returned will be counted to determine compliance with dosing regi men for TAVT -45, R -AA and prednisone. Compliance (adherence) will also be 
assessed by  a study monitor using information provided by [CONTACT_683509].

female partner of child -bearing potential * must use, with their partner, a condom plus an approved 
method of highly effective contraception from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_925534] dose of study medication.   
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that has no higher than a 1% failure rate. In this study, the only highly effective methods of contraception are:  
 
 
• Partner’s use of combined (oestrogen and  progestogen- containing) hormonal 
contraception:    
• Oral 
• Intravaginal  
• Transdermal  
• Partner’s use of progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition 
of ovulation:    
• Oral   
• Injectable/implantable    
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system   
• Partner’s use of implantable intrauterine device

 • Surgical sterilization (for example, vasectomy or partner’s bilateral tubal occlusion , 
provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of a study patient of child- bearing 
potential and that the vasectomize d partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgical success )  
Alternatively, true abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the patient ’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle. Periodic abstinence ( eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods for 
the female partner ) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a patient  is 
usually not sexually active but becomes active, they, with their partner, they must comply with 
the contraceptive requirements detailed above.  
*For clarification, a women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any female who 
has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not post menopausal 
(defined as amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months; or women on hormone replacement therapy with documented serum follicle -stimulating hormone level ≥35 mIU/mL).  
6.4.1  
Exposure to Partners During the Study   
There is a significant risk of drug exposure through the ejaculate (which also applies to vasectomized  males) that might be harmful to the sexual partners (both male and female), 
including pregnant partners of male patients . Therefore, a condom should be used by [CONTACT_683510] .

6.5 Efficacy assessments  
6.5.1  Serum testosterone  
Samples for serum testosterone during the Screening period will be taken between 7 am and 10 am .  The result of this serum testosterone will be used to qualify the patient f or participation 
in the trial and to randomize eligible patients  with stratification by [CONTACT_53920].   
Samples for serum testosterone assessment point s during the treatment period as  specified in 
Table 1 should be taken between 7 and 10 in the morning and be  analyzed using a validated and  
ultrasensitive testosterone assay  at a central laboratory with a lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) of 0 .1 ng/dL .  The serum testosterone obtained pre -dose on Day 1 will be the baseline 
value for any testosterone change from baseline comparisons  during the treatment period.  
6.5.2  
Prostate-specific antigen  
Samples for PSA will be collected as specified in Table 1 should be taken between 7 and 10 in

For a cohort of up to 8 patients randomized to TAVT -45 granules  and participating in the serial 
PK sampling on Day 1 and Day 9, blood samples (approximately 4 mL)  will be collected at the 
following times:  
• Day 1 : at pre-dose (± 30 min), and 0.25 (± 5 min) , 0.5 (± 5 min) , 0.75 (± 5 min) ,  
1 (± 5 min) , 1.5 (± 10 min) , 2 (± 10 min) , 3 (± 10 min) , 4 (± 30 min) , 8 (± 30 min) ,  
10 (± 30 min ), and 12 (± 30 min ) hours post-dose and before the scheduled evening dose  
• Day 9:  at pre-dose (± 30 min), and 0.25 (±  5 min), 0.5 (± 5 min) , 0.75 (± 5 min) ,  
1 (± 5 min) , 1.5 (± 10 min), 2 (± 10 min) , 3 (± 10 min) , 4 (± 30 min) , 8 (± 30 min) ,  
10 (± 30 min), and 12 (± 30 min)  hours post-dose and before the scheduled evening dose 
Patients will be in the fasted state  (overnight fast of at least 8 h)  at the time of morning TAVT -45 
administration and will remain fasted for 2 hours after morning dose adminis tration after which 
time the normal meal schedule may be resumed. The morning dose of TAVT -45 granules will be 
reconstituted with water on Days 1 and 9.  Abiraterone concentrations in these serial samples will  
be analyzed using a validated bioanalytical method.   
6.7 Safety 
All safety assessments should be done prior to study treatment administration. Appropriate safety 
assessments should be repeated after the dose is administered  as per Table 1. 
Safety assessments will include: 
• Clinical chemistry  and hematology  
• Vital signs  
• Electrocardiograms  
• Physical examination  
• AEs 
6.7.1  Clinical laboratory assessments  
At Screening only, patients will be tested for HCV and HBsAg to determine eligibility.  
At Screening and during the study, l aboratory safety  tests will also be performed according to the 
time schedule presented in Table 1.  The following parameters will be collected: 
• Haematology :  Haemoglobin, Platelet Count, White Blood Cells, including  absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC)  
• Clinical Chemistry : Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Albumin, Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Bilirubin (Total), Bilirubin (Direct) (only 
if Total is elevated), Creatine Kinase, Creatinine, Gamma Glutamyl Transferase, Glucose (Fasting), L actate Dehydrogenase , Potassium, Phosphate (Inorganic), Protein 
(Total), Sodium, Urea 
• Urinalysis : Bilirubin, Blood, Glucose, Ketones, Leukocytes, Nitrites, pH, Protein, 
Specific gravity, Urobilinogen 
In cases where laboratory findings are outside the normal range and the investigator believes that the results may be of clinical significance, repeat sampling may be requested as clinically indicated. If the abnormal finding is clinically significant, appropriate actions will be taken e .g., 
Confidential  
EudraCT [ADDRESS_925536] be  reported as an 
AE. 
Additional blood and/or urine samples may be taken for safety tests. Furthermore, additional 
assays outside those specified in the protocol may be performed for safety reasons as requested by [CONTACT_093]. 
6.7.2  
Vital s igns 
Vital signs  will be performed  according to the time schedule presented in Table 1. Vital sign 
assessments will include blood pressure , heart  rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_37526] ; body 
weight will also be measured according to the time schedule presented in Table 1, with the patient  
lightly clothed and without shoe s. Patient  height (without shoes) will be measured at S creening 
only. 
If a patient  shows an abnormal assessment at any stage, repeat measurements may be made and 
the abnormality followed to resolution if required. Additional measurements may be taken as 
deemed neces sary by [CONTACT_683511], including changes from baseline, must be reported as an AE. 
6.7.[ADDRESS_925537] a full physical 
examination at Screening, and then abbreviated exams during each subsequent visit  that will be 
targeted assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by [CONTACT_44239], AEs, or 
other findings . 
Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the 
study site. Significant findings that are present before si gning the ICF must be included in the 
relevant medical history CRF. Significant findings made after signing the ICF which meet the 
definition of an AE must be recorded in the Adverse Event  CRF.  
7  SAFETY  MONITORING  
7.1 Adverse events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and unintended sign, including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, symptom or 
disease) in a clinical investigation patient  after providing informed consent for  participation in 
the study until the end of study visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
An adverse reaction is any untoward and unintended responses to study trea tment related to any 
dose administered.

TAVT45C02

Protocol Version 3.0   
 An unexpected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction in which the nature or severity is not 
consistent with the Reference Safety Information (RSI) outlined in the IB (for TAVT -45) or 
SmPC (for R -AA).  
All AEs sponta neously reported by [CONTACT_683512]- ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning from the study personnel (e.g., “How are you feeling?” “Have 
you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?”), or reveal ed by 
[CONTACT_129158].  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they are clinically significant, 
which is defined as fulfilling at least one of the following criteria:  
• they induce clinical sig ns or  symptoms, 
• they fulfil any of the criteria for a serious adverse event , 
• they require  therapy  
• they cause a dose reduction, or interruption or discontinuation of a medication 
• they cause study withdrawal  
• they require additional investigation 
Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF, accompanied by [CONTACT_6644]:  
• the severity  (intensity)  grades  according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 or higher  that has 
unique clinical descriptions of severity for each adverse event, but follows the following guidelines:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL) (preparing 
meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; li miting 
self-care ADL (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden).  
• Grade 4: Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 : Death related to AE.  
• its relationship to the study treatment (TAVT -45 or R -AA). See NOTE below 
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_104841].  
• Not related: The adverse event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_683513]; lack of efficacy / worsening of the treated 
condition; concomitant medication, or no obvious temporal relationship exists between the study medication and the adverse event .  
• its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be  reported  
• outcome

 • whether it constitutes a serious adverse event and which seriousness criteria have been  
met 
• action taken regarding investigational  treatment.  
 
NOTE : Causality (relationship between each AE and study treat ment) must be carefully  
considered to answer a question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE or SAE may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_104841]? The investigator must endeavor to obtain sufficient  
information to support the causa lity of the AE a nd give their opi[INVESTIGATOR_683486] (list not exhaustive) : time  latency, 
concurrent conditions (including disease under study), concomitant medications, dechallenge 
(even resolves o r improves after interruption of study treatment) or rechallenge (event reappea rs 
or worsens when dosing is resumed) and pharmacological activity of study treatment.  
Once an AE is detected, it must be followed until its resolution, until it is judged to be  permanent,  
or it becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained. A ssessment must be made 
at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the  outcome. 
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a given etiology. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the adverse event. Associated signs or symptoms not generally attributed to a given diagnosis should be recorded separately.  
If deterioration in a laboratory value, vital sign, ECG or other safety assessment is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result or other finding will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of cli nical signs and symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteriorations in non- mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).  
Deterioration of eg.  laboratory value  or other safety assessment  that is unequivocally due to 
disease progression should not be reported a s an AE.  
To ensure patient  safety, every AE, regardless of causality, occurring after the patient  has provided 
informed consent and until the Follow -up Visit must be captured via the eCRF as soon as possible 
on learning of its occurrence . AE follow up inf ormation will be collected as required until either 
the event is considered as resolved, agreed as not possible to resolve or until the patient is lost to follow up.     
7.2 Serious adverse  events  
7.2.1  Definition of SAE  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (SAE) if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it meets any one of the following criteria:  
• Death.  
• Life-threatening.  Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i .e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Note: an 
emergency room or urgent care visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmission will not be recorded as 
an SAE under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled or

 planned before signing of informed consent, or elective treatment of a pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline. However, unexpected complications 
and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_341920]. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186223] (i.e., no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) will not be considered serious.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical event.  An impor tant medical event is an event that may not result 
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15977], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient or patient and may require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All malignant neoplasms will be 
assessed as a medically important event if other seriousness criteria are not met.  
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product  of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction. All AEs (serious and non -serious) are captured on the e CRF.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_925538] be reported to T avanta or 
designee  within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence  (see Safety contact [CONTACT_31307]) . 
Any SAEs experienced after this period should only be reported to T avanta  or designee  if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment.  
All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of 
the initial SAE and recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_6537] -up to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_30755] [ADDRESS_925539] be reported separately as a new  event.  
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report.  At a minimum, the following information should be provided:  
• Sponsor study number  
• Subject number  
• Valid reporter (reporter and PI [INVESTIGATOR_59844])  
• Event term (Diagnosis if available, symptoms if not)  
• Suspected study medications (IMPs)

Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form.  
 
8 DATA REVIEW AND DATABASE  MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Site monitoring  
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Tavanta 
representative or designee will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. CRFs) with 
the investigators and their staff. During the study, Tavanta employs several methods of ensuring 
protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) compliance and the quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient  records, the accuracy of 
data capture / data entry, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Continuous monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a CRO .  
The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient  in the study, consisting of case 
and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be

 traceable to these source documents in  the patient 's file. The investigator must also keep the 
original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_102]  (a signed copy is given to the  patient ). 
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consisten cy with the data capture and/or CRF entries. T avanta monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary va riables. Additional checks 
of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study- specific 
monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patient s will be  
disclosed. 
8.[ADDRESS_925544] certify that the data entered into the CRF  are complete and accurate. After  
database lock, the investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_683487].  
8.3 Database management and quality  control 
CRO/ Tavanta staff will review the data entered into the CRFs by [CONTACT_683516]. Queries can be asked to the investigational site. Designated investigator  site staff is 
required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data.  All queries and responses are subject to an audit trail.  
Concomitant medications entered into  the database will be coded using the World H ealth 
Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Concomitant procedures, non- drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_683488] y for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. 
Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s) dispensed to the patient  and all dosage 
changes will be tracked . Each occurrence of a code break w ill be reported to the clinical team and 
monitor. The c ode break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request 
of Tavanta . 
The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and  accurate, it will be locked, and 
the treatment codes will be made available for data analysis.  
8.4 Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established to review the safety data collected during the conduct of the study and monitor the progress of the study.  
Details of the composition, roles, and responsibilities, and processes of the DMC will be  
documented in a separate DMC C harter. The DMC will review safety data at specified intervals 
and can make recommendation s to the Sponsor to stop or amend the study on the basis of safety 
findings. The frequency of these reviews , as well as the data to be reviewed , will be agreed with 
the DMC and outlined in the Charter, with DMC review meetings being held in a blinded manne r 
to the Sponsor . Outcomes of the DMC review meetings will be shared by T avanta or designee 
with the Investigators.

TAVT -45 compared to Zytiga (reference abiraterone acetate formulation, hereafter referred to as 
R-AA) in patients with mCSPC (distant metastases) an d mCRPC. Randomizat ion will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_683490] (CSPC vs CRPC) and baseline testosterone (<10 vs ≥ 10 ng/ dL). 
Patients will be treated for 84 days and randomized into one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio: 
• TAVT -45:  Administered twice daily as 1 x sachet containing TAVT -45 (250 mg abiraterone 
acetate) + Prednisone (5 mg once or twice daily, depending on prostate cancer population)  
• R-AA once daily:  Ad ministered once daily as (2 x 500 mg Zytiga tablets) + Prednisone 
(5 mg once or twice daily, depending on prostate cancer population)  
It is planned to enroll 10 8 patients in this study (n= 54 patients per prostate cancer population), 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio receiving either TAVT -45 (n=27 mCRPC and n= 27 mCSPC patients) 
or R-AA (n= 27 mCRPC and n= 27 m CSPC patients).  
9.2 Efficacy endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the comparison of the average of serum testosterone levels on 
days 9 and 10 between groups ( TAVT -45 vs R -AA).  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint  is the PSA-50 response, defined as a decrease of ≥  50% in 
PSA levels from baseline  at any time over the [ADDRESS_925546] -treatment period . 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• Serum testosterone levels at Day s 28, 56 and 84  
• PSA-50 response at Days 28, 56 and 84 
• PSA levels at Day s 28, 56 and 84 
• Trough concentrations of abiraterone at Days 9, 28, 56 and 84 
9.3 Safety endpoints  
The following safety endpoints will also be assessed:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Physical examination findings  
• Clinical laboratory asse ssments , including potentially c linically significant changes  
• Vital signs measurements, including potentially clinically significant changes  
Safety variables will be summarized descriptively. The number and percentage of patient s with 
abnormal or potentially clinically significant clinical laboratory values  and vital sign 
measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].  
9.4 Pharmacokinetic endpoints  
For a cohort of up to 8 patients randomized to TAVT -45 and participating in the serial PK 
sampling on Day 1 and Day 9, the following PK parameters will be determined:  
• Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to [ADDRESS_925547] dose  
(AUC 0-12)  
• Maximum measured plasma concentration (C max)  
• Minimum measured plasma concentration (C min)

 • Time to maximum measured concentration (t max)  
• Accumulation ratio (Rac)  
• Effective half -life (t½)  
9.5 Other endpoint s 
Other exploratory endpoints may be described within the study SAP .  
9.6 Sample size  
In this study, the effects of TAVT -45 250 mg BID on serum testosterone will be compared to 
R-AA (given at 1000 mg QD) based on the equivalence approach of determining the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) of the test -to-reference geometric mean ratio  within the 80 to 125% 
equivalence limit  [ 1,2].  
Under the assumptions of a coefficient of variation of 25%, a lower and upper limit of 80% to 
125%, and an expected test -to-reference ratio of 1.05, 108 patients in total ( 54 patients in TAVT -
45 and 54 patients in R -AA) will provide approximately  80% power (two one -sided t -tests at 0.05 
level) to conclude therapeutic equivalence of TAV T-[ADDRESS_925548] be enrolled 
(n=27 in each treatment arm ), which will provide at least 80% power  for mCRPC patients . This 
sample size for each cancer population is also consistent with a similarly designed trial evaluating 
the therapeutic equivalence of R -AA and an abiraterone acetate fine particle formulation  [15].  
To ensure  an ad equate number of patients are enrolled  given the above sample size considerations , 
additional patients may be randomized to ensure that a total of 108 patients are treated up through 
Day 9 for collection of the primary efficacy endpoint data. 
9.7 Data analysis   
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. Before database lock, a final Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared that will con tain full details of all planned 
analyses.  Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the clinical study report . 
9.7.1  
General analyses  
Statistical analysis will be performed on the following populations:  
• mCRPC Intent -to-treat population  (CR-ITT) : All randomized patients  who have mCRPC  
• Intent -to-treat population  (ITT) : All randomized patients  inclusive of both mCRPC and 
mCSPC  
• Safety population:  All randomized patient s who receive at least one dose of study 
medication, including those who do not complete the study.  
• Per-protocol population: All randomized patient s who do not have a major protocol 
deviation that could potentially impact efficacy . 
 
All original and derived parameters as well as demographic data will be listed and described using summary statistics. Frequency counts (number of patient s and percentages) will be made for each 
qualitative variable. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be calculated for each quantitative variable (unless otherwise stated) and will be presented by [CONTACT_3148] (if applicable).

TAVT45C02  
 
 Tavanta Therapeutics , Inc.  
Protocol Version 3.0   
 If not otherwise specified, ‘baseline’ refers to the last non- missing observation before study 
medication administration. All statistical tests will be two -sided and performed at the 5% level of 
significance, unless otherwise stated.  
For c hanges from baseline, only changes subsequent to the defined baseline will be shown in the 
listings and tabulations; in the listings any repeat/unscheduled measurements will be included in 
chronological order with the scheduled measurements, no unscheduled and/or repeated 
measurements (unless used as the baseline measurement) will be included in the tables . 
Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data  
If any baseline value is missing, the screening value will be used.  Post baseline missing values will be kept a s missing.  For efficacy data analyses, different missing data imputation methods 
may be explored to test the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis method and will be defined 
within the SAP . 
9.7.2  
Efficacy data  analys es 
The primary endpoint, the average serum testosterone  levels on days 9 and 10, will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_12359] (ANOVA) model  with treatment as a factor . The test -to-reference 
geometric mean ratio effect and its 90% confidence interval (CI)  of TAVT -45 to R-AA will be 
compared to  80% to 125%  limit.  
The primary analysis will be performed based on the CR- ITT and repeated on the  ITT and per-
protocol populations .  
Differen t missing data imputation approaches will be used as sensitivity analyses based on the 
intent -to-treat population  and will be defined within the SAP .  
PSA-[ADDRESS_925549] -treatment period will be analyzed by a logistic 
model with treatment as a factor. Odds ratio, 95 % CI using modified Wilson score method of 
TAVT -45 to R -AA will be presented.  
Serum testoster one levels at Days 28, 56 and 84 will be analyzed as the same manner as the 
primary endpoint.  
PSA-50 response at Days 28, 56 and 84 will be analyzed by a logistic model with treatment as a 
factor. Odds ratio, 95% CI and p -value will be presented.  
Trough c oncentrations of abiraterone at Days 9, 28, 56 and 84 will be summarized descriptively. 
The number of patients with trough concentrations abiraterone above and below 8.4 ng/mL at Days 9, 28, and [ADDRESS_925550] 2020 -005611 -46 Page 56 
TAVT45C02

Protocol Version 3.0   
 9.7.3  Multiplicity and testing s trategy  
In order to  control the family -wise type I error, a sequential testing procedure will be 
implemented. The primary endpoint, the average of serum testosterone levels on days 9 and 10, 
will be tested using two one -sided t -tests at 0.05 alpha [ 1,2].  
If the equivalence of the average of serum testosterone levels on days 9 and 10 is achieved, th en 
the key secondary endpoint  (PSA-50 response, defined as a decrease of ≥50% in PSA levels from 
baseline at any time over the 84- day post -treatment period ) will be tested at 0.[ADDRESS_925551]. If rejected, the same primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will 
also be tested for the overall population using the ITT population. 
9.7.4  Safety d ata analyses 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as  adverse events that started after the first dose 
of study drug ( reference or test)  or events present prior to the first dose of study treatment but 
increased in severity based on preferred term) will be summari zed.  Non-treatment- emergent AEs 
will be presented  in a listing but not summarized  by [CONTACT_1570].  
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570];  the number and percentage of patient s having 
any AE, having an AE in each primary system organ class and having each individual AE  will be 
presented .  Summaries will also be presented for AEs by [CONTACT_683517].  If a patient  reported more than one AE with the same preferred term, the AE with the 
greatest severity will be presented. If a patient  reported more than one AE within the same primary 
system organ class, the patient  will be counted only once with the greatest severity at the system 
organ class level, where applicable. SAEs will also be summarized.  Separate summaries will be  
provided for death, SAE, other TEAEs leading to study treatment interruption or study treatment 
discontinuation. 
The number and percentage of patient s with abnormal or potentially clinically significant clinical 
laboratory values and vital sign measurements will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].  These thresholds 
will be pre -defined within the SAP. 
9.7.5  Pharmacokinetic data analyses  
Plasma samples will be analyzed using a validated assay; the samples from all evaluable patient s 
will be analyzed.  PK parameters for abi raterone will be calculated using a non- compartmental 
analysis . 
Patients  who are dosed and who have sufficient concentration- time data to report at least one PK 
parameter will be included in the PK analysis.  PK calculations will be performed using Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin® (Version 8.0 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SAS ® (Version 9.4 or higher, 
SAS Institute Inc.). Additional details regarding the PK analysis will be included within the SAP.  
Abiraterone concentration -time data and PK parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_683518]  (n, mean, SD, min, median, max, and CV%).  Procedures for 
accounting for missing, unused, or spurious data, specific to the PK analyses, will be outlined 
separately in the SAP.

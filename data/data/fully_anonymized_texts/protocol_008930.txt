Use lay language whenever possible.Dry mouth is a medically based condition that impairs many facets of patients� quality of life. Persistent dry mouth,resulting from diminished or low salivary flow, contributes to burning mucosa, dental caries, difficulty with chewingswallowing and digestion of food, and candidiasis overgrowth. Current treatments focus on palliative care to rehydratethe mouth primarily with water using of chipped ice, sippi[INVESTIGATOR_557529], and applying moisturizing gelsand liquids intraorally through the day. However, the effects of these treatments are temporary at best. There are moreinvasive and systemic treatments, but their use and effectiveness is limited, and may have unpleasant side effects.Medical devices have been employed to manage various systemic conditions in the last 15 years. Studies havedemonstrated that the use of medical devices improve health outcomes due to mitigation of compliance and behaviormodification issues, and therefore improvement in the health, and feeling of well beings in patients. The Voutia externaloral irrigation device was designed to address the quality of patients� lives who suffer from dry mouth. Instead ofpatients carrying ice chips or water to use throughout the day, the device delivers continuous, hands-free water inadjustable flow levels. Early patient comments suggest an improvement in the quality-of-life issues associated with drymouth. The aims of this study are to 1) assess patient perception of Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL)using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and the Xerostomia Inventory (XI), 2) assess salivary flow usingsalivary testing, and 3) mucosal appearances using the Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS) before and after the useof the Voutia device to deliver water intraorally for 4-6 weeks. 2. * Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions.  Use lay language whenever possible.Medication and systemically-induced oral dryness can result in various conditions resulting in a severe reduction inquality of life. Current treatments given for diminished or no salivary flow are most often palliative and do not offer longterm relief. This study's hypothesis is based on assessing the effectiveness of treating dry mouth through water rehydration usingthis extra oral water pump/irrigation device. Will the water pumped into the patient's mouths by [CONTACT_557557], hands-free device effectively relieve the symptoms of oral dryness? Will the use of a water pump/irrigationdevice, instead of the use of current palliative treatment modalities, positively affect quality of life of patients whoexperience oral dryness?3. * Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  Use lay language whenever possible.The aims of this study were 1) assess patient perception of Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) using theOral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and the Xerostomia Inventory (XI), 2) assess clinical changes using salivarytesting, and 3) mucosal appearances using the Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS) during clinical exam.4. * Describe the scientific benefit or importance of the knowledge to be gained:The Voutia external oral irrigation device was designed to address the quality of patients� lives who suffer from drymouth. The product manufacturer has reported early patient comments suggest an improvement in the quality-of-lifeissues associated with dry mouth. This study is designed to measure this further, and offer statistical analysis to determine if the effects are significant.5. * Describe any potential for direct benefits to participants in this study:Relief of the following:Need to sip liquids to aid in swallowing foodDryness when eating a meal Getting up at night to drinkDifficulty in eating dry foods Using sweets or cough lollies to relieve dry mouthExtraoral and skin drynessDry eyes, nose, and lipsAdditionally as pertains to quality of life, relief from:Trouble pronouncing any words because of problems with your teeth, mouth or dentures. Worsened sense of taste.Painful aching in the mouth. Finding it uncomfortable to eat any foods because of problems with your teeth, mouth or dentures. Being self-conscious because of your teeth, mouth or dentures. Feeling tense because of problems with your teeth, mouth or dentures. Unsatisfactory diet restrictions because of problems with your teeth, disability mouth or dentures.Interrupted meals because of problems with your teeth, mouth or dentures.Difficulty relaxing because of problems with your teeth, disability mouth or dentures.Embarrassment because of problems with your teeth, mouth or dentures.Irritability with other people because of problems with disability with your teeth, mouth or dentures.

For example, any engagement with specificcommunities to respond to community-identified needs, or ways the study will strengthen the well-being ofthe specific communities if applicable:Many different groups of people suffer from chronic dry mouth. This condition can be caused by [CONTACT_6589], or healthconditions, and can make it difficult to eat speak, and/or remain active. Standard treatment for dry mouth include usingmedications, rinses, and sippi[INVESTIGATOR_557530]. These treatments help some patients, but many patientsstill suffer silently with the discomfort of constant oral dryness. The Voutia irrigation device is a non-surgical, external pump designed to pulse water into the mouth at a rate set by [CONTACT_15619] . It is designed to help reduce the need for medications, rinses, and carrying and sippi[INVESTIGATOR_557531], during meals, during exercise, and during sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_8071].We want to use our clinical exam and survey to measure the effect of using the Votia device and learn if it will helppeople suffering from dry mouth to have an improvement in their quality of life, as well as in the health of their mouths.7.

A contingency plan describes the alternative procedures that a study would want to use in case of an emergency thatprevented normal study activities from occurring. It is a form of adaptive protocol. It enables the VCU IRB to quicklyapprove alternative study activities along with criteria for when those activities would or would not be put into effect.For example, in 2020, some studies had a COVID-19 Contingency Protocol approved that described alternativeremote procedures that they would switch to whenever the University restricted in-person research activities.In all studies, investigators are strongly encouraged to plan prospectively and build flexibilities into their regularprotocols (regardless of whether an emergency situation exists) as well as think about what they would do in anemergency situation. For example, windows for timed study visits, ranges instead of exact values, flexibilities ininclusion criteria, etc. Flexibility and adaptations that are built into the protocol will reduce the number of changesthat have to be submitted to the IRB and should reduce the number of incidents of deviations and noncompliance by[CONTACT_431].

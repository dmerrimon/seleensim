Clinical Phase  2 
IND [ZIP_CODE]  
IND Sponsor  Allergen Research Corporation (ARC)  
Number of Subject s Approximately 50 p eanut  allergic  subjects will be randomized 1:1 to peanut 
Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) versus  placebo .  
Objective  The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of Characterized Peanut 
Allergen through reduction in clinical reactivity to limited amounts of peanut 
allergen in peanut -allergic children and young adults (ages 4 -26 years, 
inclusive).  
The secondary objectives are:  
• To demonstrate the safety of Characterized Peanut Allergen as 
measured by [CONTACT_393245] e events and dosing symptoms.  
• To evaluate the immunological effects of peanut OIT therapy.  
• To determine the time course of tolerated up -dosing 
• To evaluate safety based on physician global assessment of disease activity  
Study Design  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind placebo- controlled  study of 
efficacy  and safety of  characterized peanut OIT  in peanut allergic 
individuals.  The study will consist of a screening period, a double -blind OIT 
treatment (up -dosing and maintenance) period, followed by  a double -blind , 
placebo controlled  food challenge ( DBPCFC ).  An open -label safety follow -
up study (ARC002) is planned after completion of ARC001.  
All eligible subjects will receive an escalating dose of either characterized peanut allergen or placebo.  Beginning at Week 22, eligible subjects who 
reach the targeted daily dose of 300 mg /day and maintain that dose for 
[ADDRESS_493435]  not reach ed 
300 mg/day will continue to up -dose as tolerated until they are eligible for 
the DBPCFC (after 2 weeks home dosing with 300 mg /day) or until they 
reach Week [ADDRESS_493436] will be 
unblinded when he/she completes  the DBPCFC  at the end  of 2 weeks 
treatment with 300 mg/day . 
All placebo subjects are eligible for rollover into the ARC002 protocol. 
Placebo subjects in ARC002 will undergo an escalation schedule identical to 
that for active subjects in the ARC001 protocol .  All subjects on active 
treatment who pass the DBPCFC  are eligible to proceed to ARC002.  Those 
who do not pass will be considered endpoint  failures . 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been established for the study to monitor the study for safety.   
Study Duration 6 to 9 months

table below) will occur in a clinical research c enter or other monitored 
setting.   All up -dosing will be performed under direct observation.   Therapy 
details are found in Section  3 and Section 6 of the protocol.  
Exit DBPCFC : After the subjects have been up-dosed to a 300 mg/day dose 
and have continued to receive that dose for at  least 2 weeks , subjects will 
undergo a DBPCFC of up to 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) peanut protein or 
placebo .   
All placebo subjects are eligible for rollover into the ARC002 protocol. 
Placebo subjects in ARC002 will undergo an escalation schedule identical to

In addition, peanut OIT has been administered under IND  (Investigational New Drug 
Application ) at Duke and Arkansas and under a separate IND at Stanfo rd.*  A total of 44 
cases from Duke/Arkansas were analyzed and [ADDRESS_493456]. Efficacy was 
demonstrated in 26 cases (17 active and 9 placebo) matching the published information. Sixteen ou t of [ADDRESS_493457] ive treatment group was

were similar to those reported in the Duke/Arkansas data.  
 These published findings, along with the additional clinical data, are the basis for a 
Phase II trial to investigate peanut OIT for efficacy and safety in desensitiz ing peanut

that could preclude the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393213].   
 
1.4 Rationale for Selection of Study Drug Regimen 
The rationale for dosing builds on the work of the Consortium of Food Allergy Research 
(CoFAR) and its investigators.  The dosing consists of a single -day initial escalation at 
very low doses , followed by a build- up phase of dose escalation, with a single escalation 
occurring every 2 weeks.  This has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and efficacious 
in previous studies and will be used in this current trial.26  
 
1.5 Rationale for the Dose Used for the DBPCFC  
The study DBPCFC will be conducted in accordance with  the recommended 
PRACTALL guidelines although the screening DBPCFC will not exceed  the 100 mg 
(143 mg cumulative) dose to assess inclusion criteria, and the exit DBPCFC w ill not go 
above a 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) dose to help ensure patient safety.  Additionally, 
the DBPCFC s will progress through the dose levels in an unaltered sequence without 
repeating any dose. 
 The exit DBPCFC will assess protection against slightly more than 1 peanut’s worth of peanut protein 300 mg (≥443 mg cumulative dose) since accidental exposures typi[INVESTIGATOR_393214].  To assess further desensitization, patients tolerating the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) incremental dose will also be challenged with 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative), although not up to the 3000 mg dose (4443 mg cumulative) , since 
at this point they will have been up-dosed only to the 300 mg dose level.   Since subjects are enrolled only if they are sensitive to ≤100 mg level (143 mg cumulative) peanut protein on the screening DBPCFC, this woul d represent a 10x 
increase in the incremental dose tolerated (and 10.3x increase in  cumulative dose) which 
would be in line with the previous demonstration of a 10x total increase, although this was after treatment for [ADDRESS_493462] been many oral immunotherapy studies 
performed using procedures and dosing similar to those proposed in this P hase 2 study.

In general, safety profile has been very good across the studies, and based on those 
studies, approximately 80 %, 15%,  and <1% of the subjects  are expected to have a mild,  
moderate or severe symptoms , respectively, during some point in their dosing with the 
peanut immunotherapy.  It is important to note that essentially all adverse events  have 
been allergy -related, predictable, and reversible.   The major atypi[INVESTIGATOR_393215] a single case of eosinophilic 
esophagitis, reversible upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90524].  Specifically, the buildup and daily maintenance doses of peanut OIT may cause allergic symptoms including sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, flares of eczema, ocular, nasal, oral and/or throat pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, cough, wheezing, and/or shortness of breath in addition to severe anaphylaxis.  The likelihood of a subject experiencing any allergic symptoms is expected to be lessened by [CONTACT_393251] a clinical setting until the 
maintenance dose is achieved.  
 Oral fo od challenges may induce an allergic response.  Allergic reactions can be severe, 
including life -threatening allergic reactions; however, the risk of an allergic reaction is 
reduced by [CONTACT_80927] a very small amount of the food, graduall y 
increasing the dose, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80872] a reaction.  If subjects have an allergic reaction during the challenges, they may need oral, intramuscular, or intravenous medications, and will be treated per study center  standard of care.  Trained 
personnel, including a physician, as well as medications and equipment (per PRACTALL recommendations and investigational site standard operating procedures) , will be 
immediately available to treat any reaction.  The anticipate d rate of seri ous life -
threatening anaphylactic reactions would be < 0.1%.  
 There may be a risk that during participation in the trial the subjects may decrease their vigilance against accidental peanut ingestion because they believe they are protected from i t.  This phenomenon has been reported in previous trials.  S ubjects in the trial and 
their participating family will be warned that they sh ould continue to practice their usual 
vigilance against ac cidental ingestion of peanuts or peanut- containing foods .

may receive placebo during the double-blind treatment period of the study.  Information 
from this study may help researchers to better understand peanut allergy or to develop future tests or treatments  to help patients with this condition.

3. Study Design  
ARC001 is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. The study 
design is illustrated in Figure 3–1. 
Figure 3–1. Study Design  
 
 
3.1 Screening period  
Subjects  age 4  to 26 years  with  a clinical history of peanut allergy,  a serum IgE to peanut 
of > 0.35 kU A/L and/or a skin prick test ( SPT) to peanut of >3 mm v ersus control will be 
screened .  All eligible subjects will undergo an initial DBPCFC  at screening .  The 
DBPCFC  will include both a peanut challenge and a placebo challenge.   The screening 
DBPCFC  will be an abbreviated version of the DBPCFC  described in the PRACTALL 
guidelines using up to 100 mg (143 mg cumulative) peanut protein and  placebo. 
 Those who have dose- limiting symptoms at or before the 100 mg (143 mg cumulative) 
dose of peanut protein  (measured as  200 mg of peanut  flour) will be enrolled into the 
study, since they would be expected to benefit from protection against limited amounts of allergen exposure.  Those who successfully consume a dose of >[ADDRESS_493464] had dose- limiting symptoms to both parts  of the 
screening DBPCFC (i.e., to oat flour as well as peanut flour) will be considered to be a 
screen failure and will not be randomized. 
 Approximately 50 subjects who pass screening will be randomized 1:1 to either active peanut protein or placebo using TEMPO ™’s password-protected Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS)  provided by [CONTACT_393253].

subjects and the rest of the study personnel will be blinded to the treatment assignments.  
 After the initial escalation visit (comprising 2 or 3 days) , subjects will report to the study 
center every 2 weeks to escalate their  OIT dose, up to a n expected  daily dose of 
300 mg /day of peanut protein in subjects able to tolerate the up-dosing. The dosing 
escalation schedule is described in detail in  Table 3-1 and Table 3-2.

All subjects who reach and tolerate 300 mg/day for 2 weeks will undergo an exit 
DBPCFC.  Those unable to achieve a dose of 300 mg/day  of peanut protein by 34 weeks 
will be considered escalation  failure s and will not undergo an exit DBPCFC. 
 
During the treatment period, the subjects will be monitored for tolerability as illustrated  
in Figure 6–1 and Figure 6–2 (s ee Section 6.8.4).   
 If a subject is removed from therapy because of failing escalation  during the initial 
escalation period (Visit 1; Days 1 to 3), the subject will be followed for safety and asked 
to return to the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493468] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (see  Section 6.5).   
 If a subject ’s up-dosing is halted  because of failing subsequent build-up (i.e., after the 
initial e scalation  period; Visit 1 ), the subject will continue to be dosed at the last tolerated 
dose level and to be followed for safety  biweekly (following their established vis it 
schedule) until Week 24, i.e., a maintenance phase (See also Section 6.8.4).  Dosing will 
be stopped after the Week 24 Visit; and the subject will be asked to return to the Clinical 
Research Center [ADDRESS_493469] to undergo an Early 
Discontinuation Visit (see  Section 6.5).   
 
For subjects who halt dose- escalation after Week 24, there will be no maintenance phase.  
Dosing in these subjects will be discontinued when dose-escalation is stopped.  They will 
be followed for safety and  asked to return to the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493470] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (see Section  6.5).    
 For subjects who achieve the targeted dose of 300 mg/d by [CONTACT_10585] 34, the maintenance phase comprises the last two weeks of the study.  
 Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment before Week [ADDRESS_493471] dose . 
 A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) has been  established and will meet every 
3 months to monitor the study for safety.    
3.3 Exit DBPCFC  
All s ubjects who reach the targeted daily dose of 300 mg /day and maintain that dose for 
2 weeks will undergo an ex it DBPCFC . The exit DBPCFC will be performed in  
accordance with PRACTALL guidelines, but requiring progression in an unaltered 
sequence ( Table 6-2), without repeating any dose.   
 
Each subject will be unblinded after  he/she completes the DBPCFC.  
 Subjects who do not reach the target dose by W eek 34 are not eligible for the exit 
DBPCFC , and will be considered escalation failure s.  They will be unblinded no sooner 
than Week 24.

All p lacebo subjects are eligible for rollover into ARC002.  Placebo subjects  enrolled  in 
ARC002 will undergo an escalation schedule identical to that for active subjects in the ARC001 protocol.  All subjects on active treatment who pass the DBPCFC  are eligible to 
proceed to ARC002.  S ubjects in the active treatment group who do not pass the 
DBPCFC at the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) protein level will be considered endpoint failures  and will not be eligible for rollover into the ARC002 protocol.  
 
3.4 Follow- up Study ARC002  
All placebo subjects are eligible for rollover into ARC002. Placebo subjects enrolled in 
ARC002 will undergo an escalation schedule identical to that for active subjects in the ARC001 protocol. All subjects on active treatment who successfully complete the ARC001 DBPCFC are eligible to proceed to ARC002 and continue dosing, with an opportunity for additional up-dosing.  
3.5 Study Design Safety Considerations  
The study design considers important safety issues: 
 
• All dose escalations w ill be  supervised in the clinic 
• The peanut OIT will only escalate to  a maximum 6 mg  single dose during the 
initial escalation on Day 1 
• Dosing symptoms and adverse events will be captured  throughout the study 
• All subjects  and/or their participating family  (as appropriate for age and home 
circumstances)  will be provided with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528]- injector  and will be 
trained in its use  
• Subjects will be strongly cautioned against consuming any peanuts or peanut-
containing foods other than the study product whi le on study, and will be 
instructed to remain on a peanut- free diet.

symptoms at the exit DBPCFC . 
 
3.7 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are as follows:  
• Change from baseline in tolerated dose of peanut protein at DBPCFC  
• Maximum dose achieved with no or mild symptoms at exit DBPCFC 
• Physician global assessment: Disease activity as measured on a 100 -mm visual

with the vehicle food.  At each clinic visit, each subject will receive a set of capsules to be taken at home according to their specific dose level while maintaining treatment blinding.  The subjects 
should be instructed to document capsules taken at home using diary logs and bring all unused capsules back to the clinic at every visit.  
5.3 Drug Accountability  
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator is 
required to maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (subject -by-subject accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or 
deliberately destroyed.  
 Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each subject .  This log will contain the 
identification of each subject  and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. 
 All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection by [CONTACT_93243].

 A physician will be available at all times during any of the Clinical Research Center peanut OIT dosing visits.  
Day 2 Initial Escalation  
All subjects will return  to the clinic on Day 2 for the ir next dose.  This dose will be the 
previous day’s dose or the last tolerated dose from the initial day escalation.  The maximum dose is 6.0  mg.  The minimum dose for Day 2  is 3.0 mg.  
 Those subjects administered: 3.0 mg  
• If tolerated, return home on that dose for 2 weeks until the next escalation 
• If not tolerated, the subject is considered an escalation failure, discontinued from treatment, and followed for safety until the Early Discontinuation Visit 
 Those subjects administered: 6.0 mg 
• If tolerate d, return  home on that dose for 2 weeks until next escalation 
• If not tolerated, return on Day 3  with a 1 -step reduction  (3.0 mg) 
 
Day 3 Initial Escalation  
Those subjects with moderate symptoms on Day 2 at the 6.0 mg dose will return on D ay 
3 for an observed dose.  The maximum dose on Day 3 would be 3.0 mg.  
Those subjects administered  3.0 mg  
• If tolerated, return home on that dose for 2 weeks until next escalation.

initial up -dose is  to be administered a t the clinic.  
 Subjects  who require dosing reduction during the 2- week period will reset their [ADDRESS_493501] tolerated dose  level .   
These subjects will be followed for safety  biweekly (following their established visit 
schedule) while continuing to be dosed at their last tolerated dose level until Week 24, 
i.e., a maintenance phase (see also Section 6.8.4) .  Dosing will be stopped after the 
Week  24 visit; and the subject will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493502] to undergo an Ear ly Discontinuation Visit 
(see Section 6.5).  For subjects who halt dose- escalation after Week 24, there will be no 
maintenance phase.  Dosing in these subjects will be discontinued when dose- escalation 
is stopped.  They will be asked to return to the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493503] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (see 
Section  6.5).    
 For any noted symptoms during the maintenance phase, the same study dosing rules for build-up phase will be followed.  As no ted above, for subjects who halt dose- escalation 
prior to Week 24, the maintenance phase extends to Week 24; and for subjects who halt 
dose- escalation after Week 24, there is no maintenance phase.   For subjects who achieve 
a dose of 300 mg/d by [CONTACT_10585] 34, the maintenance phase comprises the last two weeks of 
the study.      Subjects will continue to follow a peanut restricted diet for the duration of the study.    Note that all study products to be used in the build-up phase for this study ha ve been 
filled from a single lot, so no reductions based on lot changes should be necessary.

6.6.1  Screening Double -Blind , Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC) – 
For All Subjects  
The initial DBPCFC  for eligibility will consist of ascending levels of the peanut flour 
(containing ~50% peanut protein) or placebo in gradually increasing doses at 20-30 min 
intervals.   The DBPCFC will be performed in accordance with PRACTALL guidelines, 
but requiring progression in an unaltered sequence without repeating any dose.  The 
procedure will also be modified in that the top dose will be capped at 100 mg (143 mg cumulative) peanut protein or placebo.  The PRACTALL doses as shown in Table 6-1 
will be used, as well as PRACTALL rules for safety, assessment, scoring , and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
At the investigator’s discretion, a 1  mg dose may be added at the beginning of the 
escalation  (for a ma ximum cumulative dose of 144 mg peanut protein).  In the event that 
the 1 mg dose is added, any rules that apply to subjects based on a cumulative dose of 143 mg will also apply to subjects based on a cumulative dose of 144 mg.  The DBPCFC  is conducted as 2 challenges during a single day visit or over 2 days, using 
a placebo  (oat flour) for one challenge and peanut (as peanut flour) for the other.  If 
conducted in a single day, at least [ADDRESS_493508]’s caregiver nor the physician knows which challenge contains the peanut or the placebo. 
 
6.6.2  Exit Double -Blind , Placebo Controlled Food Challenge (DBPCFC) - For All  
Subjects  
The exit DBPCFC  will be conducted in a manner similar to  the screening DBPCFC  but 
with a dose increasing up to 600 mg  (1043 mg cumulative) peanut protein as shown in 
Table 6-2.  
 Subjects receiving active treatment will be considered a study success if they are able to 
complete  a challenge with 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) peanut protein.

6.7 Physician Global Assessment  
A 100- mm visual analog  scale ( VAS ) will be used by [CONTACT_393262] a marker for safety.  
 
In assessing overall disease activity, the investigator should consider the frequency of allergic reactions (both observed and reported), their type, their severity, and the dose 
level at which they have occurred .  With these factors in mind, the investigator is to 
assign a single integrated overall disease activity  score.  
 The investigators will be asked : 
  “How would you rate the severity of the overall disease activity on a scale of 0, no 
disease activity, to 100, very severe disease activity?”  
 
0 
 100  
No 
Activity   Very 
Severe  
 Investigators are permitted to refer back to previous assessments when making their VAS determination of overall disease activity . 
 Although not validated specifically  as an instrument for evaluating food allergies, t he 
VAS is , nevertheless,  a widely used tool in assessing disease activity, especially in 
inflammatory diseases.  
 
6.8 Reactions and Treatment of Reactions 
6.8.1  Reactions  and Treatment of Reactions to Peanut  OIT During Initial 
Escalation 
The process algorithm for symptoms during the initial escalation protocol is shown in 
Figure 6–1 in Section 6.8.4. 
 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  14 May 2014  

Allergen Res earch Corporation  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 71 
Protocol ARC001 Amendment 3  
Subjects may develop symptoms during the initial escalation protocol, similar to those 
seen during other desensitization protocols (e.g., venom immunotherapy, drug desensitization).  The severity of the reaction will be determined on the basis of the investigator’s judgment, using the definitions in the PRACTALL consensus report on 
DBPCFC as a general guide . The investigator’s judgment will also  be required to 
determine the best course  of action , with possible actions being the following:  
• Extension of time interval between dosing (up to an additional 30 min ) without 
any additional treatment   
• Institution of enhanced clinical monitoring. This could include (though is not limited to) mor e frequent vital sign  monitoring (including respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), 
auscultation, and/or the addition of pulse oximetry  
• Treating  with antihistamine  and then resuming dose escalation within [ADDRESS_493509] dose, if assessed as safe  
• Treating additionally with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], beta-agonist, oxygen, IV fluids, and/or 
glucocorticosteroids, and discontinuing dose- escal ation 
• Discontinuation of desensitization protocol   
 For oral/pharyngeal pruritus  occurring in isolation  – the recommended action is to 
continue the normal dosing in 30 min  (though the action taken is, as always, at the 
investigator ’s clinical discretion) . 
 For mild symptoms , including, but not limited to : 
• Skin – limited  (few) or localized hives, swelling  (e.g., mild lip edema ), skin 
flushing (e.g., few areas of faint erythema) or pruritus (mild, e.g., causing 
occasional scratching  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – rhinorrhea  (e.g., occasional sniffling or sneezing ), nasal congestion, 
occasional cough, throat discomfort  
• Gastrointestinal ( GI) – mild abdominal discomfort (including mild nausea), minor 
vomiting  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865])  and/or a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_393220]’s discretion , the action should be either:  
  
• Advance to next dose in 30–60 min  or 
• Treat  with antihistamine and then resume dose escalation within [ADDRESS_493510]  as safe to continue dosing (i.e., having no or minimal residual signs or 
symptoms)  
 If moderate symptoms  occur, including, but not limited to: 
• Skin – systemic hives  (e.g., numerous or widespread hives), swelling  (e.g., 
significant lip or face edema), pruritus  causing protracted  scratching , more than a 
few areas of erythema or pronounced erythema   
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing 
without dyspnea 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  14 May 2014  

Allergen Res earch Corporation  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 71 
Protocol ARC001 Amendment 3  
• GI – persistent moderate abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/nausea, more than a single 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_393221]/or diarrhea 
 
If the symptoms are not worsening or amassing at a rapid pace, then a stepwise approach to treatment may be taken at the discretion of the investigator.  If the first action  
undertaken is to implement a n observation period, the observation period should not 
exceed  [ADDRESS_493511] with antihistamines  or immediately with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] , as 
deemed appropriate by  [CONTACT_20603] .  Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393222], per investigator judgment.    
 If moderate symptoms  occur at any of the doses below 6 mg (i.e., up to and including 
3 mg), then the desensitization protocol will be discontinued and the subject considered an escalation failure.  The decision to discontinue escalation (at any dose below, or at, 
3 mg) is based solely on the determination that the symptoms of allergic reaction are moderate, regardless of whether treatment is instituted or what type of treatment is instituted.  If moderate symptoms occur only at the 6 mg dose, then the following day’s 
dose (Day 2 or Day 3)  will be reduced to [ADDRESS_493512] in  
any decision s related to the study protocol. 
 If more severe symptoms  occur, including, but not limited to : 
• Skin – severe generalized urticarial/angioedema/erythema  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – laryngeal edema, throat tightness with hoarseness, wheezing with 
dyspnea, stridor  
• GI – significant severe abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/repetitive vomiting  and/or 
diarrhea  
• Neurological – change in mental status  
• Circulatory – clinically significant hypotension (see Appendix 3 ) 
 The action s taken should be to discontinue the initial escalation and administer the 
appropriate rescue medications.  The desensitization protocol will be discontinued 
regardless of the dose at which the severe symptom or symptoms occurred, and the subject considered an escalation failure.  
 Summary of Initial Escalation Dosing Requirements  (see also Figure 6 –1
 in 
Section  6.8.4)  
 In general, i f the subject requires one or two  doses of antihi stamine treatment for mild 
symptoms during the initial escalation protocol, then the initial escalation may be 
continued.  If, however, the subject requires a second  medication (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], a 
beta-agonist, or other medications) in addition to an antihistamine , or multiple doses of 
antihistamines, the initial escalation is to be terminated and the subject will receive no further OIT , even if sy mptoms are assessed to be mild .   
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  [ADDRESS_493513] will receive no  further OIT, regardless of 
whether treatment is instituted or what type of treatment is instituted.  The only exception 
to this is if the occurrence of modera te symptoms is restricted to the 6 mg dose.  In this 
case, and this case only, may testing be attempted the following day (Day 2 or Day 3) at a reduced dose (3 mg).   If the  initial escalation is completed with no symptoms or only mild symptoms, subjects 
should have , at a minimum,  a 2-h post
-protocol observation period before continuing in 
the study.  If the subject experiences moderate to severe symptoms, the observation 
period is to be at least 4  h, and up to 24 h (in an appropriate facility), based on th e nature 
and severity of the symptoms and the treatment regimen required to stabilize  the subject’s 
condition.  
6.8.2  Reactions During Build -up P hase: Preventative and Non
-pharmacological 
Interventions   
The process algorithm for symptoms during the build-up/up-dosing phase is shown in Figure 6–2. 
 
Subjects will begin the Clinical Research Center dosing scheme as outlined until 300 mg/day of peanut protein is reached.  Subjects will return for a supervised dose escalation in the clinic every [ADDRESS_493514] be made by 4 weeks.  Subjects should withhold their daily home dose on the escalation day but should take all other prescribed medications.  Note that the daily home dose should be taken as part of a meal.  It is recommended that the dose be taken at a consistent time (within a 4 -
hour time period), and it is critical to take the dose every day.  Doses should be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 12  h.   
 Subjects who require dosing reduction during the 2- week period will reset their 2 -week 
escalation schedule to maintain the new dose for a 2 -week period prior to attempting to 
escalate again.  
 With the occurrence of symptoms of a dose-reaction or any allergic reaction, 
subjects/parents  (or guardians)  are instructed to call the study site.   
 Should significant systemic symptoms, which may include mild symptoms based on physician discretion or moderate or greater symptoms, be reported during the daily home 
dosing, the symptom/dosing algorithm will be followed (s ee Figure 6–2) to determine 
the best course of action.  The appropriate treatment will depend on the type and severity  
of symptoms (see Section  6.8.3).   
 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  [ADDRESS_493515] will be 
considered  an escalation  failure .  These subjects will be followed for safety biweekly 
(following their established visit schedule) while continuing to be dosed at their last tolerated dose level  until Week 24, i.e., a maintenance phase (See also Section 6.8.4).  
Dosing will be stopped after the Week 24 Visit; and the subject will be asked to return to 
the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493516] to 
undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (see Section 6.5).  For subjects who halt dose-
escalation after Week 24, there will be no maintenance phase.  Dosing in these subjects 
will be discontinued when dose-escalation is stopped.  They will be asked to return to the 
Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493517] to undergo an 
Early Discon tinuation Visit (see Section 6.5).  No additional DBPCFC will be 
performed.    
 Subjects will be free from active wheezing or a flare of atopic dermatitis prior to any dose 
escalation.  Subjects will be maintained on their current dose of study product until their flare of asthma or atopic dermatitis resolve s.   
 Subject s will be cautioned against activities likely to increase reactivity (e.g., exercising 
or taking hot showers or baths within 4 h after dosing).    At the physician’s discretion, temporary dose reduction s, ranging from a 1 -step 
decrement (i.e.,  to the previous dose) to approximately half of the current  dose level  (to

from symptoms of an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_393223], or during menses.  If the 
dose is reduced by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_493518] observation.  
If the reduction in dose is maintained for ≤3 days, then the pre-reduction dose may be resumed directly.  For dose reductions of 1 dose level maintained for ≤3 days, whether dose re- escalation is to occur at home or in the CRC is at the investigator’s discretion.  If

escalating in a bi-weekly stepwise fashion.   
 Doses may also be withheld at the investigator’s discretion, in response to an AE, whether the AE is assessed to be treatment -related or not.  If doses are withheld for this, 
or any, reason, the rules for missed peanut OIT doses ( Section 6.7) apply. 
 Subjects may develop symptoms during dosing for the build-up phase.  The investigator’s judgment will be required to determine the best course of action with possible actions being the following:  
• Continue with daily home dosing 
• Continue the same daily dose for the rest of the 2- week interval , with 50% of the 
dose split between doses given 8- 12 h apart  
• Return for repeat dosing in Clinical Research Center

Protocol ARC001 Amendment 3  
• Return for dosing of previously tolerated dose (without escalation) in Clinical 
Research Center  
• Discontinuation of dosing  
 
If a subject has a dose escalation in the Clinical Research Center without symptoms, the action should be to continue per protocol with daily home dosing of the tolerated dose with the next escalation visit to the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493520] experiences only oral/pharyngeal pruritus during the administration of the 
daily dose, then the same dose can be repeated the next day at home and continued throughout the interval unless other symptoms begin to develop (see below).  For mild symptoms , defined as:  
• Skin – limited  (few) or localized hives , swelling  (e.g., mild lip edema), skin 
flushing (e.g. , few areas of faint erythema) or pruritus (mild, e.g., causing 
occasional scratching ) 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – rhinorrhea  (e.g., occasional sniffling or sneezing ), nasal congestion, 
occasional cough, throat discomfort 
• GI – mild abdominal discomfort (including mild nauseas ), minor  vomiting  
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) and/or a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_393224] (D ay 2) at home or to have the 
subject return to the Clinical Research Center the next day (Day 2) for a repeat of the previous day’s  dose or the last tolerated dose (at the physician’s discretion).  If the dose is 
tolerated, then the subject will continue on that dose and return at the normal interval.  If the dose causes mild symptoms again, then the subject will return to the Clinical Research Center (D ay 3) and be given the last tolerated dose (i.e., a 1 -step dose 
reduction) or a 2-step d ose reduction.  If tolerated, the subject will continue on this dose 
for the normal time interval.   If mild symptoms recur, a further 1 -2-step reduction sh ould 
be administered the next day (D ay 4)  in the CRC.  If tolerated then that dose should be 
continued for 2 weeks.  If not tolerated, revert to a lower dose.    If moderate symptoms  occur, defined as: 
• Skin – systemic hives  (e.g., numerous or widespread hives), swelling  (e.g., 
significant lip or face edema), pruritus causing protracted scratching, more than a few areas of erythema or pronounced erythema 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – throat tightness without hoarseness, persistent cough, wheezing 
without dyspnea 
• GI – persistent moderate abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/nausea, more than a single 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_393221]/or diarrhea 
 The action should be to have the subject return to the Clinical Research Center the next day (D ay 2) for dosing with the previous day’ s dose or the last tolerated dose (at the 
investigator’s discretion ) under observation.  If the dose is tolerated, the subject will 
continue on that daily home dose for the normal time interval per protocol.  If the subject does not tolerate this dose, the subject should receive the last tolerated dose (i.e., a 1- step

the normal time interval, then escalation attempted in the Clinical Research Center as noted below.  If this dose is not tolerated, then the next dose will be a further 1-2- step 
reduction in dosing (per investigator judgment) , and the dose will be given in the Clinical 
Research Center (D ay 4).  If this next dose is not tolerated, then a discussion with the 
Medical Monitor will en sue to make a decision about whether to continue the subject on 
study-product treatment in the study.  
 If more severe symptoms  occur, defined as: 
• Skin – severe generalized urticarial/angioedema/erythema  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] – laryngeal edema, throat tightness with  hoarseness, wheezing with 
dyspnea, stridor  
• GI – significant severe abdominal pain/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/repetitive vomiting  and/or 
diarrhea  
• Neurological – change in mental status  
• Circulatory – clinically significant hypotension (see Appendix 3 ). 
 The action should be to treat the subject, and at the physician’s discretion either 1) have them return to the Clinical Research Center the next day (D ay 2) for dosing with a 2- step 
reduction in dose under observation or 2) discontinue them from the study product  
treatment.  If the subject tolerates the dose reduction, then they will remain on that dose for [ADDRESS_493521] fails dose escalation after three consecutive attempts  (with 2 -4 weeks 
between) , he/she will be considered an escalation failure  and the last tolerated dose will 
be accepted as the maintenance dose (to Week 24).  If the dose escalation is completed 
with no symptoms, subjects should be observed for [ADDRESS_493522]’s condition. 
 Any subject deemed to have severe symptoms including hypoxia, hypotension, or change 
in mental status ( stage 3 anaphylaxis  defined in Appendix 3 ) or who receives aggressive 
therapy  (to be determined by [CONTACT_093], but may include such interventions as IV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], intubation, or admission to an intensive care unit) for an allergic reaction  at 
any time should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and discontinued from study product therapy.  
 For specific questions related to dosing escalation or continuation of the same dose that are not answered in the above protocol, the Medical Monitor will be available for questions.

Section  8) within approximately  1 week of discontinuation of therapy. 
 
6.8.3  Treatment for Reactions During the Build-u p Phase : Pharmacological and 
Supportive Treatments  
Treatment of individual reactions should be with either an antihistamine and/or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], along with IV fluids, a beta-agonist (e.g., albuterol, by [CONTACT_107606]), oxygen, and glucocortico steroids, as indicated.  Generally, for mild symptoms  requiring 
treatment , the subject should receive antihistamines.  Generally, for mo derate symptoms  
requiring treatment, the subjects should receive antihistamines  and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], as 
indicated .  If severe anaphylaxis (stage 3 anaphylaxis defined in Appendix 3 ) occurs at 
any time, dose escalation will stop and the dose will be reduced to the last tolerated dose and the subject continued on that dose as long- term maintenance without further 
escalation .  
 
Antihistamines  
If a subject receives antihistamines only, the dos e escalation can be continued.  If 
symptoms during a build-up day require antihistamines in multiple doses  (>2)  or in 
combination with other medications (except epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), there should be a dose reduction by 1-2 doses with the next dose given in the CRC.  If epi[INVESTIGATOR_393225], then a different course of action is to be taken (see below).  If dose 
escalation fails or requires treatment after two more escalation attempts , each spaced [ADDRESS_493524] tolerated dose and continued long term (to Week 24) without furthe r escalation.   The subject will be followed for safety 
biweekly (following their established visit schedule ) while continuing to be dosed at their 
last tolerated dose level  until Week 24, i.e., a maintenance phase (see also Section 6.8.4).  
Dosing will be stopped after the Week 24 Visit; and the subject will be asked to return to 
the Clinical Research Center [ADDRESS_493525] to 
undergo an Ear ly Discontinuation Visit (see Section 6.5).  For subjects who halt dose-
escalation after Week 24, there will be no maintenance phase.  Dosing in these subjects 
will be discontinued when dose-escalation is stopped.  They will be asked to return to the

6.9 Missed Peanut OIT Doses at any Phase of the Study:  
Missed Peanut OIT doses at any phase of the study can pose a significant risk to the 
enrolled subjects. The algorithm for missed consecutive doses of study product is as follows: 
• Miss 1 dose – The next dose would be the current dose and could be given at 
home 
• Miss 2 doses in a row – The next dose would be the current dose and could be 
given at home 
• Miss 3 doses in a row – The next dose would be the current dose and would be given under observation (Clinical Research Center) 
• Miss 4 doses in a row – The next dose would be the current dose and would be 
given under observation (Clinical Research Center) 
• Miss 5 -7 doses in a row –I nitiate the next dose as approximately 25% of the last 
tolerated dose.  This would be done under observation (Clinical Research Center).  
Dose escalation would occur in the Clinical Research Center with an escalation no sooner than weekly and no longer than every 4 weeks with dose increases of 1-dose levels at each escalation.  If symptoms occur, the dosing symptom rules in the build-up phase would apply 
• Missing >[ADDRESS_493539] to undergo an Early Discontinuation Visit (see Section 6.5) 
• Additionally; excessive missed doses, i.e., > [ADDRESS_493540]  to undergo an 
Early Discontinuation Visit (see Section 6.5). 
 No attempt should be made to make up for a missed dose if greater than [ADDRESS_493541]  will be off antihistamines for an appropriate length of time (5 half -lives of 
the antihistamine that is being used).  Oral food challenges will be undertaken under 
direct medical supervision in a Clinical Research Center or food challenge area with emergency medications and staff immediately available and will follow established study procedures.  Prior to the DBPCFC , subjects will be assessed for an exacer bation of 
asthma as determined by [CONTACT_393265] a peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_216965] < 80% of predicted.  A uniform approach for food challenges will be used.  Frequent assessments will be made for symptoms affecting the skin, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular 
system, and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352].  Dose limiting symptoms, typi[INVESTIGATOR_393232]  
(signs) , indicate a positive reaction and termination of dosing.   
 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  [ADDRESS_493542]  is off antihistamines for an appropriate length of time 
(5 half -lives of the antihistamine that is being used), a skin test probe is pressed through a 
commercial extract of an allergen into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Positive (h istamine) and negative 
(saline -glycerin ) controls are placed to establish that the response is not blocked and to 
determine if there is dermatographism, respectively.   
 
6.[ADDRESS_493543].  The decision of unblinding 
will be made in collaboration with the sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
If a life -threatening event occurs , the subject should be treated as if the subject received 
active study product.  For all unscheduled events that require unblinding, the investigator 
will contact [CONTACT_393266]’s representatives . 
 
6.13.3  Breaking the Blind  
In case emergency unblinding is nec essary, TEMPO ™ allows study personne l with 
appropriate permissions to request unblinding for a specific subject.  A n email is then 
sent to appropriate sponsor and CPWW safety designees informing them of the blinding.  
A built-in audit trail documents the unblinding process and the persons involved.

6.13.4  Documenting an Unblinding  
Any premature unblinding requires a full written account by [CONTACT_393267](s) that necessitated unblinding of the study medication for an individual 
participant.  This account includes the reason(s) for unblinding, the name [CONTACT_8152]’s medical monitor who was notified of the unblinding, the names of the unblinded individual staff members  and the date and time the unblinding occurred.  
 
7. Safety Monitoring 
This section defines the types of adverse events that should be reported and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording and reporting them.  
7.1 Definitions  for Recording of Safety Events  
All safety events observed under this protocol are reported through the data system for 
the duration of the study.  Some safety events arising under certain defined conditions are recorded on specific forms as follows.   
• Safety events related to accidental food exposure are recorded on a Food Allergy 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393233] a serious adverse event, as defined below ( Section 7.2).   
• Any allergic symptoms due to dosing will be recorded directly  on the Escalation 
Dosing form (also referred to as a Study Product Admini stration form ).  
• For any event  occurring after a subject has signed the informed consent form that 
meets the definition of  anaphylaxis,  an Anaphylaxis Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393234] 24 h of its  occurrence 
and/or the sit es being notified  of the event (see also Section 7.7.2) , if the event is 
associated with any of the following:  
o An emergenc y room visit; 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
o More than 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266776]; 
o Assessment of the anaphylaxis as severe, as defined in Appendix 3 .   
• If any safety event meets the definition of  a serious adverse event  (whether  or not 
related to dosing), it will also be recorded on an adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE) form.  Skin prick test and food challenge reactions that occur in the clinic are captured on study specific forms and are not reported on an adverse event form unless the event is considered a serious adverse event, as defined below.  All serious adverse events are reported on the AE/SAE form set in addition to the Skin Prick form or an Oral Food Challenge form if the event occurred during one of these procedures. All other safety events that occur 
throughout the study are reported on the AE/SAE form set. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_493544]  may be asked  to return to the site.  These events will 
be reported as follows: 
 
• A Food Allergy Epi[INVESTIGATOR_393235] a reaction occurs.   
• If the accidental food ingestion safety event meets the definition of a serious 
adverse event, as defined below, the AE/SAE form will be completed  as well.   
 
7.3 Definitions  
7.3.1  Adverse Event (AE) or Medical Event  
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change in 
clinical status, ECGs, routine labs, x- rays, physical examinations, etc. , that is considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_65227].   Suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implie s that 
there is evidence that the drug caused the event.  
 Adverse reaction is any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_33641].   
 
7.3.2  Serious Events (Serious Adverse Events, Serious Suspected Adverse 
Reactions or Serious Adverse Reactions)  
A serious adverse event including a serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse reaction as determined by [CONTACT_393268]: 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening AE (Life -threatening means that the study subject  was, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect 6. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but 
may jeopardize the health of the study subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event.  
 
7.3.3  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity) or severity is not consistent with applicable product information, such as safety information provided in the package insert, the investigational plan, the investigator’s brochure or the protocol.

7.5.[ADDRESS_493546] :  Is there a reasonable possibility that the study product  caused 
the event?  
 
An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction.  
 
7.6 Adverse Events Collection Procedures  
Any new event or experience that was not present at Screening, or worsening of an event 
present at Screening, is considered to be an AE. Unchanged, chronic conditions are not 
AE’s and should not be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. Adverse events  will be 
evaluated from the onset of the event until the time the event is resolved or medically 
stable, or until [ADDRESS_493547]. 
 AEs may be discovered through any of these methods: 
• Observing the subject  
• Questioning the subject, which should be done in an objective manner 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject 
• Review of medical records/source documents  
• Review of home dosing symptom logs (provided to record symptoms between 
visits  
7.6.[ADDRESS_493548] identifiers redacted,  can be scanned and attached to the adverse 
event form as well.  The investigator will treat subjects experiencing adverse events 
appropriately and observe them at suitabl e intervals until their symptoms resolve or their 
status stabilizes.  
 
7.6.2  SAE Recording and Reporting Procedures  
Serious adverse events will be recorded on the adverse event case report form (CRF).  All 
centers are obl igated to report SAEs within 24 h of their occurrence and/or the site’ s 
knowledge of the event to the Coordinating Center .  The following attributes will be 
assigned:  
• Description  
• Date of onset and resolution (if known when reported) 
• Severity  
• Assessment of relatedness to test article

 • Action taken  
 
The site investigator will apply his/her clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event is of sufficient severity to require that the subject be removed from treatment.  If necessary, an investigator will suspend any trial procedures and institute the necessary medical therapy to protect a subject from any immediate danger.  
 Subsequent review by [CONTACT_8415], the DMC , Institutional Review Board ( IRB), or the 
sponsor(s) may suspend further trial treatment or procedures at a site.  The study sponsor(s) and the FDA retain the authority to suspend additional enrollment and treatments for the entire study as applicable.  
 A subject may voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he/she perceives as an intolerable AE, or for any other reason.  If voluntary withdrawal is requested, the subject should be asked to continue (at least limited) scheduled evaluations, complete a study termination form, and be given appropriate care under medical supervision until the 
symptoms of any AE resolve or their condition becomes stable.

7.7 Serious Adverse Event Notification  
7.7.1  Notifying the Sponsor  
Study investigators will provide the Coordinating Center with data of all SAEs as defined 
per the protocol on an ongoing basis. 
 The CRO Medical Monitor is responsible for notifying the sponsor and will do so 
simultaneously with the reporting to the clinical database.  As noted above, this should be within 24 h of site awareness of the event.  The sponsor’s Medical Monitor will review 
each SAE report and will determine wheth er the SAE must be reported to FDA on an 
expedited basis.  The final decision for disposition regarding reporting to the FDA rests with the sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  The IND Sponsor is responsible for submitting the 
SAE reports to FDA.  The IND Sponsor will provide the DMC  and the Coordinating 
Center with copi[INVESTIGATOR_393236]. 
 The Coordinating Center will provide these expedited reports to the individual site 
investigators .  Events that are serious, related to therap y and unexpected will be reported 
to FDA in 15 days or for deaths and life threatening events in 7 days (per 21 CFR 312.32).  
7.7.[ADDRESS_493549], centers are instructed  to report epi[INVESTIGATOR_266775] 24 h of 
their occurrence and/or the sites  being notified of the event to the Coordinating Center if 
the event is associated with any of the following: 
• An emergency room visit; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
• More than 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266776]; 
• Assessment of the anaphylaxis as severe, as defined in Appendix [ADDRESS_493550] and Ethics Committee  
The investigator will ensure the timely dissemination of all AE information, including 
expedited reports and DMC  safety reviews , to the IRB in accordance with applicable 
local regulations and guidelines.

7.8 Other Safety Assessments  
7.8.1  Physical Examination and Vital Signs 
Physical examinations will be conducted at visits indicated in Appendix 1  Schedule of 
Events. Height and weight will also be recorded. Vital signs will also be assessed, 
including blood pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), and body temperature.  
7.8.[ADDRESS_493551] halt up -dosing and re- start with a 
reduced dose if more than three days of dosing are missed.  Seven or more days of missed dosing constitutes an individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], as does a significant number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393237] (ie, three or more days on at least three occasions).  For additional 
individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the reader is refer red back to Section 4.3.1. 
 Failure to accomplish up-dosing after three attempts will result in halting further up -
dosing attempts, with the subject  maintained at the previously achieved level.  In 
addition, administration of two or more doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393238]-related allergic reactions will result in halting further up -dosing attempts, with the subject  
maintained at the previously achieved level.

8. Mechanistic Assays  
Complementary studies will be performed to measure humoral immune responses at 
baseline and at 6 months.   
• Measurement of antigen -specific IgE and IgG4 levels  
• SPT to peanut 
 
8.1 Peanut -Specific Antibody  
Antigen immunotherapy has been shown to induce antigen-specific humoral responses.  
The balance of isotypic response may play a role in allergen sensitivity (e.g., an increase of IgG/ IgE).  
 At each of the mechanistic time points, a sample of plasma will be stored for assessment 
of peanut specific antibody levels.  Total IgE and specific IgE and IgG4 will be measured using UniCAP.  Peanut specific IgE and IgG4 blood draws will be measured at screening and at Visit [ADDRESS_493552] 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) of peanut protein with no 
more than mild symptoms  at the exit DBPCFC  (ie, responders). 
 Those who  fail to achieve the target maintenance dose of at least [ADDRESS_493553] s.  Demographic data will include age, race, sex, body 
weight and height; these data will be presented in the following manner: 
• Continuous data (i.e., age, body weight and height) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, median and range.   
• Categorical data (i.e., sex and race) will be presented as enumerations and 
percentages.   
Statistical presentation for baseline and demographic characteristics may be further 
summarized by [CONTACT_393269] -specific serum IgE.  
 
9.2.2  Use of Medications  
All medications used will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug 
dictionary.  The number and percentage of subject s receiving concomitant medications or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393239].  Statistical presentation of concomitant me dications or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_393240].  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_493554] to 
follow-up and reasons for discontinuation (e.g., adverse events) will be presented.  
Statistical presentation of study completion will be further presented via analysis of the 
secondary endpoints summarized.  
 
9.3 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
While natural history of peanut allergy desensitization is not full y understood, significant 
short-term improvements in consumption amounts are believed to be uncommon.  A true 
placebo response rate of 25% or less among subjects who undergo the exit DBPCFC is assumed in this study.  Those individuals who  fail to achieve the target daily dose or wh o 
withdraw prematurely will be treated as non -responders.  We will recruit approximately 
50 subjects . 
 If 3 subjects in each arm (about 12%) do not undergo the exit DBPCFC, then the effective placebo response rate in the ITT analysis is assumed to be 22% or less. With a 2-tailed 5% level test, there is at least 80% power to detect an effective CPNA response 
rate of 58.7% or more, which corresponds to a CPNA response rate of 66.7% or more among those who undergo the exit D BPCFC.  
 If 5 subjects in each arm (about 20%) do not undergo the DBPCFC, then the effective placebo response rate in the ITT analysis is assumed to be 20% or less. With a 2- tailed 
5% level test, there is at least 80% power to detect an effective CPNA response rate of 56.6% or more, which corresponds to a CPNA response rate of 70.75% or more among 
those who undergo the exit DBPCFC. 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  [ADDRESS_493555] controlled.  Certification for use of the web- based data entry 
system will be completed via telephone and/or web -cast training.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_493556]’s history, laboratory tests, nutritional intake, evaluation 
of allergic response and follow- up status will be s tored and processed through the data 
center.  Quality control procedures and a feedback system between the data center and the sites  will be instituted to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data collected.  
 
10.4 Access to Data  
The investigational sites shall periodically permit authorized representatives of the IND 
sponsor, and/or regulatory health authorities to examine clinical records and other source 
documents for the purpose of safety monitoring, quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of the study progress throughout the entire study period.  The investigator is required by [CONTACT_2371] (21 CFR  312.62) to keep accurate case records for at least [ADDRESS_493557] of the study. 
 
11. Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
11.1 Statement of Compliance  
This study will be conducted using good clinical practice (GCP), as delineated in the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) – 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 and 312 and in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) “Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance”, and according to the criteria specified in thi s 
study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_393270] I RB as well as FDA.  Any amendments 
to the protocol or must also be approved by t he sponsor, DMC , IRB and submitted to the 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  [ADDRESS_493558] also 
be approved by [CONTACT_393271].  
 
11.2 Informed Consent/Assent  
The informed consent form is a means of providing information about the stud y to a 
prospective subject ’s parent/guardian and allows for an informed decision about 
participation in the study.  Because the study population will be comprised of a 
significant percentage  of children, parents or legal guardians will be asked to read, si gn 
and date a consent form before a child enter s the study, takes  study product, or undergoes  
any study-specific procedures.  Children will sign an assent as appropriate.  Consent materials for parents/guardians who do not speak or read English will be translated into the appropriate language.  The informed consent form will be revised whenever the protocol is amended.  A copy of the informed consent will be given to a prospective parent/guardian for review.  The attending physician, in the presence of a wi tness, will 
review the consent and answer questions, as well as emphasize the need to avoid allergen exposure other than to Characterized  Peanut Allergen, and the necessity to continue 
exposure to Characterized Peanut Allergen to maintain de- sensitization.   The prospective 
parent/guardian will be told that being in the study is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw his/her child from the study at any time, for any reason.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_493559] ’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each 
subject  will be assigned a sequential identification number and these numbers rather than 
names will be used to collect, store and report subject  information. 
 
12. Resource Sharing  
All data derived from this study will be sent to the C oordinating C enter  for storage and 
analysis.  Subject  data will be anonymized to maintain subject  confidentiality.  All data 
derived from these studies will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journa ls in a 
timely manner.  The sponsor will review all manuscripts prior to submission to journals 
for publication and all abstracts prior to submission to national and international 
meetings.  All data sets will be archived by [CONTACT_393272], outside investigators with the approval by [CONTACT_456].   
13. Protocol Deviations 
The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol. Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures constitutes a protocol deviation. Whenever applicable, corrective actions will be developed by t he site 
and implemented promptly as a result of protocol deviations.   
13.1 Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation) 
A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the 
subject's rights, safety, or well- being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of 
the study data. In addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breaches of 
CPNA Peanut OIT  Final  [ADDRESS_493560]'s rights, safety or w ell-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the 
study data.   
13.3 Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations 
Non-Major Protocol Deviations related to data entry or visit adherence are captured 
within the data system and are not additionally reported on a separate CRF.  
 
The study site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_393241], document and 
report protocol violations/deviations and appropriate corrective action plans which are described above. However, protocol violations/deviations may also be identified during site monitoring visits or during other forms of study conduct review. All protocol violations will be reported in the data system  on a specific CRF.

Staging System of Severity of Anaphylaxis27 
Stage  Defined By  
1. Mild (skin & subcutaneous tissues, 
GI, &/or mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_696])  Flushing, urticaria, periorbital or facial angioedema; 
mild dyspnea, wheeze or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]; 
mild abdominal pain and/or emesis 
2. Moderate  (mild symptoms + 
features suggesting moderate 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular or GI

Criteria for Diagnosis28 
Anaphylaxis is likely when any one  of the three following sets of criteria is  fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness ( min to h) with involvement of: 
• Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized  hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)  
AND  
• Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/ bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF) AND /OR 
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80909] ( min to h): 
• Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized  hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) 
• Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced PEF)  
• Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
• Persistent  GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain) 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen ( min to h):  
• Infants and Children: low systolic BP (age-specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP*  
• Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline 
 
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less 
than (70 mmHg + [2 x age]) from 1-10 years; and < 90 mmHg from age 11-17 years.

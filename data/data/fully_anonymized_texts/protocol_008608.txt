 SYNOPSIS  
 
Title:  Practical Evaluation of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) and its Associated 
Alternate Indices During Routine Clinical Procedures  
 
Acronym:  PRESSUREwire  
 
Purpose:  The purpose of this study is to understand routine use of FFR and alternate 
indices in clinical practice. This study will determine the use and clinical 
outcome of FFR -guided PCI in patients presenting with either stable 
coronary artery disease, or in patients presenting with Acute Coronary 
Syndrome (ACS) on culprit and non -culprit lesions as well as during  index 
and secondary procedures.  
 
The study will also collect data on the routine use of coronary physiologic 
measurements  such as  adenosine -induced hyperemia FFR, FFR by 
[CONTACT_22242] -induced hyperemia, Pd/Pa, and other alternate indices 
measurements.  
 
Objectives:  All objectives will be evaluated for all subjects enrolled, ACS subjects and 
stable coronary artery disease  subjects separately.  
 
1. Characterize the frequency of change in treatment plan when FFR is 
used compared to the initial decision based on angiography alone . 
 
2. Characterize the 12 month  clinical outcomes (MACE) in subjects in 
whom the use of FFR did not lead to a change in treatment decision vs 
subjects in whom the use of FFR led to a change in treatment decision .  
 
3. Characterize the 12 month clinical outcomes (MACE) by [CONTACT_115675] . 
 
4. Compare resting indices with FFR values .  
 
5. Characterize the 12 month clinical outcomes (MACE) by [CONTACT_115676]-derived indices (coronary flow reserve (C FR), index of 
microcirculatory resistance  (IMR), contrast FFR, resistan ce reserve ratio 
(RRR )). 
 
6. Compare  other Pressure Wire-derived indices (CFR, IMR , contrast FFR, 
RRR ) with FFR values.  
Design:  This study is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, multicontinental open 
label observational study.  
 
The total duration of the study is expected to be 4 years, which  includes 3 
years for enrollment with 12 months of follow -up. 
 
The clinical study will be conducted in approximately 200 centers globally.

 BACKGROUND AND JUSTI FICATION FOR CLINICA L STUDY  
Fractional flow reserve (FFR) has been demonstrated to be an effective index for determining 
percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI) approach.  FFR is defined as the ratio of maximum blood flow 
in a stenotic coronary artery to maximum blood flow if the same artery were completely normal. An FFR 
of 0.80 or less, as measured with the use of a coronary  pressure wire during invasive coronary 
angiograp hy, indicates the potential of a specific stenosis to induce myocardial ischemia  with an 
accuracy of greater than 90%. Therefore, FFR is recommended for the guidance of coronary 
revascularization.[ADDRESS_129150] demonstrated that in patients with unstable angina and acute 
myocardial infarction  (MI), there are  substantial benefits of PCI, including prevention of myocardial 
infarction and reduced mortality rate.2,3 In patients with stable coronary artery disease  (CAD) , PCI has 
been shown to improve anginal symptoms and quality of life . The FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve 
Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) 2 year data showed that in patients with mutivessel 
CAD undergoing PCI with drug -eluting stents, routine measurement of FFR as compared with PCI 
guided by [CONTACT_115678] a significant reduction of the rate of mortality and myocardial 
infarction.4 
 
Currently, there has been limited research conducted on the use of FFR in ACS patients.  According to 
Depta , “a recent study determined that vasodilatory capacity of the microcirculation was similar 
between patients with non -ST elevation myocardial infarction and stable angina . Thus,  FFR 
measurement during ACS or AMI  may be reliable ”.[ADDRESS_129151]  increasing evidence that support s the role of FFR -guided 
strategy in ACS  patients .7  
 
For example, L eite notes that, “One of the most important studies about the use of FFR in ACS was 
from Ntalanis et al. 8 who studied  75 acute STEMI patients and 26 NSTEMI patients (<[ADDRESS_129152] onset) 
and measured FFR in the non -culprit stenosis immediately following PCI of the culprit vessel and then 
repeated the FFR at 35 + [ADDRESS_129153] initial procedure.   The FFR value remained unchanged between 
the acute and follow -up phases in patients with STEMI (0.78 + 0.10 vs. 0.77 + 0.20, p = NS).  In only 2 
patients,  the FFR value was higher than 0.80 at the acute phase and lower than 0.75 at follow -up.  The 
authors stated the data support s that FFR measurements are safe and reliable for evaluating the 
severity of non -culprit stenosis in the acute phase of ACS, even d uring primary PCI .”[ADDRESS_129154]  also become important to understand ing the 
physiologic significance of coronary artery disease.10 Adenosine -induced hyperemia FFR, Pd /Pa, FFR 
by [CONTACT_22242] -induced hyperemia, coronary flow reserve (CFR), the index of microcirculatory resistance 
(IMR), as well as other novel indices e.g. resistance reserve ratio (RRR), potentially aid in treatment 
decisions of patients with CAD.  
 
To date, there has not been a large registry study analyzing the use of FFR and alternate indices in 
everyday practice. The PRESSUREwire study looks to expand on the current evidence by [CONTACT_115679] -guided PCI in patients presenting with stable 
coronary artery disease, patients presenting with ACS, as well as those who received routine coronary 
physiologic measurements of adenosine -induced hyperemia FFR, Pd/Pa, FFR by [CONTACT_115680], and other alternat e indices measurements.

SJM Pressure Wire™ has been recorded. Refer to section 3. 6 for the Informed Consent Process.  
 
3.6 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
3.6.1  General process  
Prior to enrolling in the clinical study, all subjects will be consented, as required by [CONTACT_115683]’s IRB/EC.  Informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to 
any data collection . The consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_115684].  
 
Medical circumstances may occur where potential subjects require emergent medical intervention , and 
thus measurements of their FFR and other metrics  (i.e. patients experiencing ACS). As a result, and 
since this is a routine clinical practice observational study, subjects are allowed to be consented after 
the procedure, but must be consented prior to any data submission.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her authorized designee will conduct the Informed Consent Process. 
This process will include a verbal discussion with the subject on all aspects of the clinical study that is 
relevant to the subject’s decision to participate in the clinical study.  
 
The subject shall be provided with the informed consent form that is written in a language that is 
understandable to the subject and has been approved by [CONTACT_16018]’s IRB/EC.  Failure to obtain 
informed consent from a subject prior to study enrollment should  be reported to St. Jude Medical within 
5 working days and to the reviewing center’s IRB/EC consistent with the center’s IRB/EC reporting 
requirements.

6.4 PROCEDURE  
Refer to the I nstructions For Use (IFU)  for procedural steps.  
 
Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is an index determining the functional severity of narrowing(s) in the 
coronary arteries. FFR specifically identifies which coronary narrowing(s) are responsible for 
significant ly obstructing the flow of blood to the heart muscle.  FFR is used in conjunction with cardiac 
catheterization by [CONTACT_115687].  The pressure wire is then retracted until p ressure is measured in the entire coronary artery.  
 
The following data points will be collected during the procedure  for all evaluated lesions  (index or 
secondary procedures) : 
• Measurements of Pd/Pa  
• Measurements of FFR with Adenosine induced hyperemia (IC or IV)   
• MACE assessment (required)  
• Prospective treatment decisions; initial treatment plan documentation shall be prior to FFR.   
 
Other indices may be collected, according to the investigator’s clinical practice and availability of 
appropria te devices  (index or secondary procedures) , as follows;  
• IMR measurements  
• CFR measurements  
• Measurements of FFR with Contrast induced hyperemia  
• Measur ements of any additional novel resting indices (RI)  
6.5 SCHEDULED FOLLOW -UPS 
Follow -up visits will occur at Discharge and 1 -year.  
 
The following assessments will be completed at the Discharge visit:  
• MACE assessment  
 
The following assessment will be completed at the 1 -Year visit (±30 days):  
• MACE assessment

Study Name: [CONTACT_115705] [ADDRESS_129172]’s future care will not be influenced by a decision, voluntary or otherwise, to withdraw from 
the study. All reasonable efforts should be made to retain the subject in the clinical study until 
completion of the study.  
 
Reasons f or subject’s withdrawal include, but are not limited to:  
• Subject refuses to continue participating in the study  
• Subject does not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Subject is deceased (cause must be documented)  
• Subject’s participation is terminated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_115655], although the subject consented, 
since participation is no longer medically appropriate  
• Subject is ‘lost to follow -up’: Subject does not adhere to the scheduled follow up visits but has not 
explicitly requested to be withdrawn from the clinical study. (This does not apply to missed visits). 
Site personnel should at all times make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the 
subject in order to achieve subject compliance to the scheduled follow up visits:  
1.  A subject will be considered ‘Lost to Follow Up’ after a minimum of [ADDRESS_129173]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  
2.  If these attem pts are unsuccessful, a letter should be sent to the subject’s last known 
address or general practitioner (GP) and a copy of this letter should be maintained in the 
subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097].  
 
If a subject withdraws from the clinical study, the site will record the subject’s reasons for withdrawal, 
on a Withdrawal CRF.  
 
 COMPLIANCE TO CIP

to obtaining IRB/EC approval and Competent Authority approval, if applicable, and authorization from 
the sponsor in writing for the study.  
 
In case additional requirements are imposed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC or Competent Authority, those 
requirements will be followed, if appropriate. If any action is taken by [CONTACT_2717]/EC, and regulatory 
requirements with respect to the study, that information will be forwarded to St. Jude Medical.

well-being of subjects, since the non -compliance exposes subjects to unreasonable risks. For example, 
failure to adhere to the inclusion/exclusion criteria: these criteria are specifically defined by [CONTACT_115688]. This 
may be considered failure to protect the rights, safe ty and well -being of the enrolled subject. Similarly, 
failure to perform safety assessments intended to detect adverse events may be considered failure to 
protect the rights, safety and well -being of the enrolled subject. Investigators should seek minimiza tion 
of such risks by [CONTACT_110596].  
 
Simultaneously, in the event that adhering to the CIP might expose the subject to unreasonable risks, 
the investigator is also required to protect the rights, safety and well -being of the subject by [CONTACT_115689], so that subjects are not exposed to unreasonable risks.  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to provide adequate medical care to a subject enrolled in a 
study.  
 
Regulations require that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_115656], complete, and current records, including documents 
showing the date of and reason for every deviation from the Clinical Investigational Plan.  Relevant 
information for each deviation will be documented on a Deviation Case Report Form  (CRF). The site 
will submit the CRF to St. Jude Medical.  
 
Regulations require investigators obtain approval from St. Jude Medical and the IRB/EC [as required] 
before initiating changes in or deviations from the protocol, except when necessary to protect the l ife or 
physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the 
CIP to protect the rights, safety an d well-being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval 
of the sponsor and the IRB/EC. Such deviations  shall be documented and reported to the sponsor and 
the IRB/EC as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_129177] be requested when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_115657], contemplates, or makes a conscious 
decision to depart from the CIP, except whe n unforeseen circumstances are beyond the investigator’s 
control (e.g. a subject who fails to attend a scheduled follow -up visit, a subject is too ill to perform a 
CIP-required test, etc.).  All deviations, including those beyond the investigator’s control , must be 
reported on a CRF.  
 
To obtain approval, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_115658]. Jude Medical or designee prior to initiating any changes.   
 
All deviations must be reported to appropriate regulato ry authorities in specified timelines (if 
appropriate).  
 
Investigator will notify St. Jude Medical and the reviewing IRB/EC within 5 working days of:  
• Any deviation to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency  
• Any failure to obtain informed consent  
 
Investigators or the designee must notify St. Jude Medical, Inc. as soon as possible and complete the 
Deviation CRF.

 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
12.1.1  Sample Size  
This is an observational study. No formal power analysis and sample size calculations were performed.  
Approximately 2000 subjects will be enrolled in this study. To ensure enrollment balance across study 
centers, n o single center will enroll more than 10% of the maximum sample size (200 subjects). A 
target of [ADDRESS_129186] with multiple 
lesions:   
• Treatment decision is defined as “changed” if there is at least one decision change  based 
on FFR for multiple lesions; if none of the decisions has been changed for the multiple 
lesions, the treatment decis ion is defined as “unchanged”.   
• For all the continuous variables of FFR, resting indices, CFR, contra st FFR, and RRR, we 
will use the lowest value in all lesions as the value for that variable in each subject. For the 
continuous variable of IMR, we will u se the highest value in all lesions as the value for IMR 
in each subject.   
 
The following c utoff values  will be used to categorize a continuous variable into a binary variable:  
• FFR group is  defined as “low FFR” if it is  equal to or below 0.8  (the cutoff value of 0.8  is 
selected in line with contemporary guidelines and previous findings11). However, since this is 
an observational  study, there are no mandated cutoff value s for this. Therefore, we will also 
use cutoff value of 0.7512 in the analysis.  
• Resting indices group is defined as “low resting indices” if it is equal to or below 0.86 (the 
cutoff value of 0.86 is selected based on previous f indings that a baseline  Pd/P a ≤ 0.86 is 
associated with a positive predictive value of 100% for FFR measurement13). We will also 
use the cutoff value of 0.9214 in the analysis.  
 Study Document No: SJM -CIP-[ZIP_CODE]       Ver. B 
Study Name: [CONTACT_115705] [ADDRESS_129187]. Jude Medical  
• CFR is defined as “low CRF ” if it is below 2.0 (the cutoff value of 2.0 is selected based on 
previous f indings15,16). 
• IMR is defined as “high IMR” if it is equal to or above 25 (the cutoff  value  of 25 is selected 
based on previous f indings17). 
• Contrast FFR is defined as “low Contrast FFR” if it is equal to or below 0.83 (the cutoff value 
of 0.83 is selected bas ed on previous f indings18). 
• RRR is defined as “low RRR” if it is smaller than 2.0 (the cutoff value of 2.0 is selected 
based on previous foundings19). 
 
The following statistical analysis will be performed for each of the study objectives:  
 
1. Characterize the frequency of change in treatment plan when FFR is used compared to the initial 
decision based on angiography alone   
Frequency and percentage of change in treatment decisions when FFR is used compared to the initial 
decisi on based on angiog raphy alone will be presented both per subject level and per lesion level.  
 
2. Characterize the 12 -month clinical outcomes (MACE) in subjects in whom the use of FFR did not 
lead to a change in treatment decision vs. subjects in whom the use of FFR led to a ch ange in 
treatment decision.  
 
12-month MACE event rate will be summarized using frequency and percentage. Fisher Exact test will 
be performed  to evaluate the association between 12 -month MACE event and prospective treatment 
decisions, i.e. change or no cha nge, based on FFR measurements. A  repeated measures logistic 
regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) per lesion level will be performed if needed.  
 
3. Characterize the 12 month clinic al outcomes (MACE) by [CONTACT_115698].  
 
Fisher Exact test will be performed to evaluate the association between 12 -month MACE event and 
binary FFR and binary resting indices variables respectively using the following FFR and resting indices 
groups:  
1) Low FFR group (FFR ≤ 0.8) and high FFR group (FFR > 0.8).  
2) Low FFR group (FFR < 0.75) and high FFR group (FFR ≥ 0.75).  
3) Low resting indices group (Pd/Pa ≤ 0.86) and high resting indices group (Pd/Pa > 0.86).  
4) Low resting indices group (Pd/Pa ≤ 0. 92) and high resting indices group (Pd/Pa > 0.92 ). 
 
A repeated measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) per lesion  level 
will be performed if needed.  
 
A logistic regression will be performed to evaluate the association between  12-month MACE event and 
continuous FFR and  continuou s resting indices respectively.  A repeated measures logistic regression 
with generalized estimating equations (GEE)  per lesion  will be performed if needed.  
 
4. Compare resting indices with FFR values.  
 
Kappa coefficient will be used for binary variable s, and correlation will be used for continuous variables 
to examine  agreement between FFR values and resting indices.  
 
5. Characterize the 12 month clinical outcomes (MACE) by [CONTACT_115699] -derived indice s (CFR, 
IMR, contrast FFR, RRR).  
 Study Document No: SJM -CIP-[ZIP_CODE]       Ver. B 
Study Name: [CONTACT_115705] [ADDRESS_129188] will be used for binary variables, and logistic regression will be used for continuous 
variables to evaluate the association between 12 -month MACE event and other PressureWire -derived 
indices (CFR, IMR, contrast FFR, RRR) respectively.  
 
6. Compare other PressureWire -derived indices (CFR, IMR, contrast FFR, RRR) with FFR values  
 
Kappa coefficient will be used for binary variable s, and correlation test will be used for continuous 
variables  to examine  agreement between FFR values and other PressureWire -derived indices (CFR, 
IMR, contrast FFR, RRR) respectively . 
 
12.1.4  Additional Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize each component of MACE rate at 12 months, and FFR, 
Pd/Pa and other PressureWire -derived indices (CFR, IMR, contrast FFR, RRR) measurements during 
index procedure and secondary procedures.  
 
12.1.5  Reporting  
The foll owing data will be summarized and reported after 500, 1000, 1500 subjects com plete 12 -month 
follow -up visit:  
• Investigator sites and enrollment status  
• Demographic and baseline characteristics  
• Serious Adverse events  
• 12-month MACE rate  
 
When all enrolled sub jects complete 12 -month follow -up visit, all statistical analyses described in this 
section will be conducted and a final clinical report will be completed.

APPENDIX B: STUDY GUIDELINES  
 
Universal Classification of Myocardial Infarction  
Type 1: Spontaneous myocardial infarction  
Spontaneous myocardial infarction related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, Assuring, erosion, 
or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more of the coronary arteries leading to 
decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli with ensuing myocyte necrosis. Th e patient may 
have underlying severe CAD but on occasion non -obstructive or no CAD.  
Type 2: Myocardial infarction secondary to an ischemic imbalance  
In instances of myocardial injury with necrosis where a condition other than CAD contributes to an 
imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand, e.g. coronary endothelial dysfunction, 
coronary artery spasm, coronary embolism, tachy -/brady -arrhythmias, anemia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], 
hypotension, and hypertension with or without LVH.  
Type 3: My ocardial infarction resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable  
Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG 
changes or new LBBB, but death occurring before blood samples could be obtained, before  cardiac 
biomarker could rise, or in rare cases cardiac biomarkers were not collected.  
Type 4a: Myocardial infarction related to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)  
Myocardial infarction associated with PCI is arbitrarily defined by [CONTACT_115702] >5 x 99th 
percentile URL in patients with normal baseline values (<99thpercentile URL) or a rise of cTn values 
>20% if the baseline values are elevated and are stable or falling. In addition, either (i) symptoms 
suggestive of myocardial ischemia, or  (ii) new ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, or (iii) angiographic 
loss of patency of a major coronary artery or a side branch or persistent slow - or no -flow or embolization, 
or (iv) imaging demonstration of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wal l motion abnormality 
are required.  
Type 4b: Myocardial infarction related to stent thrombosis  
Myocardial infarction associated with stent thrombosis is detected by [CONTACT_115703] a rise and/o r fall of cardiac biomarkers values with at least 
one value above the 99th percentile URL.  
Type 5: Myocardial infarction related to coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG)  
Myocardial infarction associated with CABG is arbitrarily defined by [CONTACT_115704] 
>10 x 99th percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values (<99th percentile URL). In addition, 
either (i) new pathological Q waves or new LBBB, or (ii) angiographic documented new graft or new 
native coronary artery occlu sion, or (iii) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new 
regional wall motion abnormality.

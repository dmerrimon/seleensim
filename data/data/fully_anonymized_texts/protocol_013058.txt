[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
January 13, 2014   
PCIT -ED Study Protocol  
 
Parent Child Interaction Therapy Emotion Development (PCIT -ED) will be conducted  with a 
sample of preschoolers who exhibit symptoms of depression compared to a wait list (WL) 
control after which participants will receive the active treatment. PCIT -ED is an expansion of 
PCIT, a well -known, widely used and proven effective treatment for  preschool disruptive 
disorders. To address early disturbances of mood and affect, a novel ED module was added 
based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_427966]. The ED module targets parent emotion 
learning skills with the goal of training the parent to serv e as a more effective emotion teacher 
and coach to the child. The goal of the ED module is to enhance the child’s capacity for emotion 
recognition and regulation or "emotional competence." In order to test the efficacy of PCIT -ED, 
to estimate accurate effe ct sizes and to investigate mediators and moderators of treatment 
response participants will complete comprehensive pre -, interval, and post -assessments.  
 
SCREENING  
Prior to screening potential participants, a research team member will obtain verbal consen t 
(see 'Initial Phone Screen'). Once this is complete and the team member answers parents' 
questions, the PFC (if not already completed) and then Initial Phone/Exclusion Screen will be 
administered. If team member suspects possibility of an ASD, the SRS wi ll be administered to 
the parent. If eligible based on PFC and Initial Phone/Exclusion Screen (and possibly SRS), 
another phone interview will be scheduled and the team will administer the MDD 
Phone/Inclusion Screen which will be audio recorded. Research s taff will utilize Washington 
University's Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to administer and record information 
from potential participants. When potential subjects screen -out based on not meeting MDD 
eligibility criteria, the research team will s end the 'PCIT -ED RCT Screen -Out Follow -Up Letter' to 
inform them of the possibility of re -screening if the child's moods and behaviors worsen.  
 
BASELINE, POST [ADDRESS_541062] 2 ASSESSMENTS:  
-TAKE HOME:  
If eligible based on the MDD Phone Screen, parents will rec eive several forms (BRIEF, ERC, My 
Child, Emotion Understanding Parent Questionnaire, BIS/BAS, Contact [CONTACT_7171], Teacher 
Contact [CONTACT_7171]) in the mail or if families have internet access via REDCap to complete 
before the laboratory assessment. This w ill take approximately 1 hour to complete. A copy of 
the Consent Form and Consent Letter will be included in this take -home packet (sent via mail or 
email). At the Post 1 & Post 2 assessments, parents will receive this packet/REDCap link (BRIEF, 
ERC, My Ch ild, Emotion Understanding Parent Questionnaire) prior to the in -office assessment 
to complete on their own.  
 
-IN-OFFICE:  
Parent and child will complete the Parent Child Interaction - DPCIS as well as Teaching Tasks 
(marble maze, etch -a-sketch, and prohibi ted toys) at Baseline, Teaching Tasks (magnet puzzle, 
team drawing and prohibited toys) at Post [ADDRESS_541063] the child in completing Handedness, Height & Weight 
measurement, FACE - Blurry Face & Emotion Labeling, KIDSEDF, Emotion Understanding, KBIT -
2, Narratives, Dot Probe task, Narratives for Suicidal Ideation, and Death Interview. All these 
tasks will be video recorded and take approximately 1.5 -2 hours.  
 
The parent will independently complete the BDI, PFC -Scale, ECBI, CBCL, PSI, CCNES, GPSQ, 
PSDQ, and OC -YC Screener. Another research team member will work with the parent to 
complete the KSADS -EC, Breastfeeding Questions , LEC -Child, PECFAS/CAFAS, FIGS, HBQ Medical 
& Peer Relationships sections, Asthma Questionnaire, Religion in Subject Family, and SES 
measures; this portion will be audio recorded. FIGS will be used to obtain information about the 
parent reporter; when par ents report symptoms or diagnosis of specific disorders, the 
appropriate screener/checklist will be administered [MDD, Mania, and Anxiety (GAD, OCD, 
Panic Disorder); Alcohol, Drugs, Psychosis]. Research staff will utilize Washington University's 
Research E lectronic Data Capture (REDCap) to administer and record information from parent 
participants. Parents will complete the MSCEIT online via a secure website. They will also 
complete the Parent -Child Conflict Tactics Scales and the Parental Survey of Media E xposure or 
Media Quotient - A Questionnaire for Parents via REDCap survey. The parent assessment will 
take approximately 4 -5 hours. Clinicians will complete the CGAS following the assessment. Any 
self-report measures not completed in office may be complete d via REDCap or paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_427967].  
 
-TEACHER:  
We will also ask parents to give permission to contact [CONTACT_150359]’s teacher to complete a 
questionnaire regarding his/her behaviors and development. Teachers will receive the C -
TRF/TRF in the mail or a REDC ap link via email with a copy of the permission letter and brief 
description of the study/measure to be completed and returned via mail/electronically via 
REDCap.  
 
After completing the Baseline assessment, if the participant child continues to meet DSM MDD 
criteria (adjusted for development) families will be randomly assigned to receive immediate 
treatment or be placed on an [ADDRESS_541064] after which they will re ceive treatment.  
 
TREATMENT (Immediate Treatment Randomization: ~Week [ADDRESS_541065] Randomization: 
~Week 18 -36) During the treatment, parent and child will work with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_427968] [ADDRESS_541066] to improve their relationship, 
learn safe and effective disciplinary techniques, as well as both learn strategies to deal with a 
range of emotions. (See attached Sessions Manual) The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_427969] a weekly basis. Parents will complete the ECBI prior to each session. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_427970] e the DPI[INVESTIGATOR_45599], EDCI, TIC, OC -YC Screener, and Acceptance Inventory throughout the 
course of treatment.  
 
INTERVAL A, B, C & D ASSESSMENTS (~ Weeks 6, 12, 24, 30) Either over the phone, at the Early 
Emotional Development Program, or via REDCap, parents will co mplete the HBQ -P Peer & 
Medication section, CBCL, PFC -Scale, BDI, PSI, CCNES and TAI. This will take approximately [ADDRESS_541067] 2 assessment if families are willing to do so.  
 
LONG TERM FOLLOW UP  
After the completion of planned study visits (Baseline, Post 1,  and Post 2 assessments), the 
research team will contact [CONTACT_427975]/or email with the contact [CONTACT_427976]. This will be done in order to ensure up -to-date contact [CONTACT_3031]. The research 
team will update their contact [CONTACT_427977] -up studies 
with this population. Participants can let us know if they would no longer like to be contact[CONTACT_427978].  
 
PCIT -ED Statistical  Analysis Plan  
 
All measures  will be collected  at pre- and po st-treatment ass essments (except EI). In addition, 
the HBQ -P (measuring symptom sev erity of all Axis I disord ers and impairment), PFC-Scale, 
parent BDI-II, PSI, EDCI (measuring ESL in both groups) and will be collected  at the 6- and 12-
week assessments in both groups. In the PCIT-ED grou p, these interval assessments 
correspond to comp letion of the CDI and PDI modules. 
 
An intent-to-treat analytic approach  will be emp loyed. Multiple imp utation will be utilized for 
subjects who d iscontinue du ring the study and do  not complete the post-treatment 
assessment. Multiple impu tation is desirable beca use instead of filling in a single value for 
each missing data point, each missing value is replaced with a set of plausible values, creating 
multiple impu ted datasets. These datasets are then analyzed us ing standard procedures (that 
would be  appropriate for a single, complete dataset), and results from the multiple da ta sets 
are combined into one set of results. The SAS procedures MI and MIANA LYZE will be used for 
creating and analyzing multiple imp uted data, resulting in statistically valid results that 
appropriately reflect the uncertainty due to missing values. 
 
Multiple impu tation is a useful  method  for analysis of datasets with data that are plausibly 
missing at random (MAR). Missing values rarely occur completely at random (MCAR). Instead, 
missing values are typi[INVESTIGATOR_427971], so they are MAR. During the multiple 
imputation process, the analyst sh ould use all observed  variables ava ilable in pred icting 
missing values (even variables not used in ana lysis). If these vari ables are useful for predicting 
missing values, the multiple imputation increases  power. Furthermore, by [CONTACT_427979], the multiple imp utation process creates a largely MAR dataset. 
Thus, multiple imp utation can convert missing not at random (MNAR ) data to MAR . 
Simulation was used to determine sample size needed for analyzing multiple impu ted 
datasets. We  assume N=90 completers in each  grou p, so a simulated  dataset  with N=180 
subjects was created. Change in PAPA MDD sev erity sum  scores were generated assuming 
normally distributed scores  with a SD  of 4.69  (pooled SD from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]) and a mean 
difference in ch ange sco res in the two groups of 2. 5. The demographic vari ables gen der, age, 
race, family income, parental education level, and paren tal marital status were also included 
in this dataset. To s imulate demographic characteristics, c omplete demographic profiles from 
the su bjects in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_427972] [ADDRESS_541068] on power, we assume a 25% drop-out rate in 
the PCIT-ED gro up and a 30% drop-out rate in the WL group. So 25% and 30% of the simulated 
PCIT-ED and WL subjects’  MDD sev erity sum  change scores were set to missing, respectiv ely, 
using a random number generator. Because the simulated  missingness was random, missing 
values are not pred icted by [CONTACT_427980], so d ata are missing comp letely at random (MCAR). This 
should be  realistic for the multiple imputation power analysis that follows. 
 
The SAS v9.2  MI proce dure was used to create multiple impu ted datasets with MDD sev erity 
sum  change scores  based on the simulated  demographic variables in  the dataset. Multiple 
impu tation was conducted  10 times, with 10 imp uted datase ts created. The SAS v9.2  
MIANA LYZE pro cedure was then used to run a gen eral linear model of change scores  by [CONTACT_427981]. Table 5 shows the results of the general linear 
model in the complete simulated dataset and then each  of the 10 multiple impu ted da tasets.

Rubin’s method  for determining the uncertainty of the imputed estimate was emp loyed. 
Following this metho d, the total variance from the imputed datasets is T = (mean within-
imputation variance) + (1 + 1/(N sets of  imputed datasets))*(between-imputations variance) 
= 0.689 + 1.1*0.014 = 0.70 4. The SE2 of the model co nducted on the complete simulated  
dataset is 0.532. T he ratio of these two values is 0.70 4/0.532 = 0.3 2. 
 
So, the relative  incre ase in variance due  to missing values is 32%, indicating that 1.32*180  
subjects = [ADDRESS_541069]-
assessment and on measures with interval a ssessments. Analytic approach es for each set  of 
specific aims and hyp otheses are detailed below. 
 
Specific Aim 1:  To conduct an RCT of an  early dyadic intervention for PO-MDD, PCIT-ED, 
compared to a WL  control condition. 
 
Hypothesis 1A:  Compared to those randomized to the WL, preschoolers who are first 
randomized to PCIT-ED will show significantly increased rates of remiss ion, greater reductions 
in MDD symptoms, and decreases in impairment. 
 
Hypothesis 1B:  Compared to those randomized to the WL, preschoolers who are first 
randomized to PCIT-ED will show significantly greater increases  in emotional comp etence 
measured by [CONTACT_427982]. 
 
Hypothesis 1C:  Compared to those on  the WL, paren ts who are first randomized to PCIT-ED 
will show significantly greater increases in emotion skill learning (ESL) and reductions in MDD 
symptoms and parenting stress. 
 
Analytic Approach:  Continuous post-assessment scores  will be compared between PCIT-ED 
and WL groups using analysis of covariance, covaryi ng for pre-assessme nt score s. The 
stratific ation variables, g ender and exte rnalizing como rbid diagnoses, will also be  included as 
covariates in the models. 
 
PFC-Scale and P APA MDD sev erity sum scores will be used to assess differences  in de pressive 
symptoms; HBQ and PAPA impairment scores will be analyzed to determine differences in  
functional impairment. Differences  in emotion regulation (as an executive  function) in the two 
groups will be examined using scores from the BRIEF-P; em otion development will be 
analyzed using scores  from the ERC, Emotion Understanding, FACE, KIDSED F, and the 
“Waiting” and “Puzzle” tasks.  Post-assessment EDCI, BDI-II, and PSI scores  will be compared  
between PCIT-ED and WL groups to determine differences  in increases  in Em otion Skill 
Learning and  reduction of parental depress ive symptoms and parenting stress. 
 
Rates  of remiss ion (defined by 5 0% reduction in MDD sev erity and not meeting 
diagnostic criteria) will be compared  in the PCIT-ED and WL subjects using logistic 
regression. 
 
Interval ass essment scores will also be  analyzed across  PCIT-ED and WL groups  in repeated 
measures  mixed models. In these models, repeated measures  of PFC-Scale, HBQ MDD and 
externalizing co-morbidity severity and impa irment, PSI and ESL (measured by [CONTACT_427983]) at pr e-
assessment, 6-week assessment, 12-week ass essment, and post-assessme nt will be compared 
between the PCIT-ED and WL groups. 
 
In add ition to the analyses described abov e, pre-assessme nt vari ables that cou ld poss ibly be 
associated  with outcom e, such  as subject age and maternal depression, will be investigated as 
potential predictors of outcome. 
 
Specific Aim 2:  To investigate mediators and moderators of treatment effects.  
 
Hypothesis 2A:  Parental emotion skill learning (ESL) will mediate treatment effects. Child 
depre ssion outcom es will be mediated by p arental ESL. 
 
Hypothesis 2B:  Parental Emotional Intelligence (EI, a stable trait measured at b aseline by 
[CONTACT_427984]) will be a moderator of ESL and  child ou tcome. Parents with higher EI will show 
better ESL, and as a result, children  of parents with high EI will show better outcomes than 
children  of parents with low EI. 
 
Analytic Approach:  Parental ESL will be measured with the Emotion Development Coding 
instrument. This is an itemized assessment of parents’ emo tion skill learning. Each item is 
rated as 3=satisfactory, 2=needs prac tice, or 1=not ev ident. The total ESL score  will be 
calculated  as the mean of these items. 
 
To ass ess parental ESL as a potential mediator of the relationship be tween treatment group  
and child treatment response, a macro  (for SAS or SPSS ) developed by H ayes will be utilized. 
For mediation analyses, the PROCESS macro estimates path coefficients in a mediation model 
and gen erates bo otstrap confidence intervals for the indirect effects of the independent 
variable on  the dependent variable through a mediator variable.  It is also possible to include 
covariates not proposed to be  mediators in the model. Paternal ESL will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_427985]  a potential mediator, with treatment group as the 
independent variable and chan ge in PAPA MDD severity sum  score as the dep endent vari able. 
 
Power for Mediation:  To estimate power for this mediation analysis, the following steps were 
taken. First, we expect the difference in  MDD sev erity sum  change score  in the two groups to 
be approximately 2.5, with a SD of 4.69 (based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]). With  [ADDRESS_541070], power=0.97. Next, we expect the correlation of 
change in MDD sev erity sum score and ESL score  to be a pprox imately 0.25. Using Fisher’s Z 
transformation with a samp le size of 180, the correlation of 0.25 transforms to Z = 
tanh(0.25)*SQR T(180-3) = 3.398. Subtracting 1.96  gives 1.43 8, corresponding to power=0.92. 
Thus, we will be well-powered  to detect a mediation effect. 
 
To ass ess parental emotional intelligence (EI) as a po tential moderator of treatment 
response, the PROCESS macro  will be used. For moderation analyses, the PROCESS macro 
estimates  a moderation model with the ef fect of the independent vari able on  the dependent 
variable moderated  by a proposed moderator variable. The independent vari able (ESL score) 
and prop osed moderator vari able (pre-assessment parental EI) are ce ntered  to eliminate any 
multicollinearity  effects.  The macro ge nerates the conditional effects of ESL sco re on  the 
dependent vari able (MDD sev erity sum  score) at va lues of EI score equal to selected  
percentiles (e.g., 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles) of the distribution in the 
sample. The Johns on-Neyman technique will be used to identify the values of EI score  at 
which point the effect of ESL score changes from statistically significant to statistically non-
significant. If EI sco re is found to be  a significant moderator, the independent and moderator 
variables (ESL sco re and pre-assessment EI scor e) will be dichotomized so that all subjects fall 
into 1 of 4 c ategories (low ESL with low parental EI, low ESL with high parental EI, high ESL 
with low p arental EI, and high ESL with high paren tal EI).  Post-hoc pair-wise comparisons of 
treatment outcome in these 4 groups will be conducted. 
 
Power for Moderation: To est imate power for this moderation analysis, a simulated  dataset 
of 90 PCIT-ED subjects was created. This dataset contained variables for parental ESL, 
paren tal EI, and chan ge in MDD sev erity sum  score. Random data was generated for 45 
“high EI” subjects a nd 45  “low EI” subjects assuming n ormally distributed data for each of 
these variables, with SD’s based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (SD=0.22 for ESL, SD=15.6 for EI, SD=4.69 
for MDD ch ange score). The mean scores  for the random normally distributed  data vari ed in 
the two groups as we expect it to in the propos ed study. For the “high EI” group,  assumed 
means were 2.1 for ESL, 118 for EI, and -6.5 for MDD change. For the “low EI” group,  
assumed means were 2.5 for ESL, 99 for EI, and -1 for MDD ch ange. Running the PROCESS 
macro on the simulated  dataset yielded a s ignificant interaction of ESL and E I, with a 
coefficient=0.2440 and SE=0.0758. Subtracting 1.96  from the cor responding t score  (3.219) 
gave Z=1.259, which co rresponds to power=0.90.  
  
Specific Aim 3: To investigate whether reductions in depre ssive symptom severity and 
diagnostic remiss ion is susta ined [ADDRESS_541071]. 
 
Hypothesis 3: MDD remission (not meeting diagnostic criteria for > 2 weeks) will be sustained 
at the 18 week follow-up in 80%  of su bjects who were in remission at the post-treatment 
assessme nt. 
 
Analytic Approach: Rate of [ADDRESS_541072] ass essment will be calculated  and compared to the 80%  expected rate using a Chi-
square goo dness-of-fit test. 
 
General Data An alysis Considerations: All outcome measures other than MDD diagnosis are 
continuous. The PFC-Scale and MDD se verity  scores  from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_427973]-ED and DEPI [INVESTIGATOR_427974], as determined by  [CONTACT_144407][INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk test. However, 
if these scores or other outcome scores are found to be  from non-normal distributions, the 
data will be log- or power-transformed prior to analysis. Bonferroni correction will be used 
to limit the possibility of Type I errors for the main ou tcome s. A less co nservative correction, 
such  as the Bonferroni-Holm correction, will be applied for tests of other outcom es.

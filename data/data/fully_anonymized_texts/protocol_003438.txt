 Summary of Clinical  Study Results  
A Study of Olezarsen Administered to Patients With Fa milial 
Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) (B alance ) 
Protocol #: ISIS 678354 -CS3 
Study dates:  November  2020 to October 2023   
Thank you to the participants who took part in the study, “A Study of Olezarsen 
(Formerly Known as AKCEA -APOCIII -LRx) Administered to Patients With Familial 
Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS ),” also known as the B alance  study.  
This study helped researchers find out if a drug c alled olezarsen could lower fat 
particles in blood ( triglyceride levels)  in participants who live with familial 
chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) . 
 
Why was this study done?  
FCS is a rare genetic disease . Genes are small pi[INVESTIGATOR_213253]. Genetic disease s are passed on from parent s to child ren 
through altered  (mutated) genes .  
 
FCS is characterized by [CONTACT_213295] (triglycerides) in the blood that can 
result in severe abdominal pain and other serious health problems. FCS is caused by 
[CONTACT_213296] a  special  protein  called  lipoprotein lipase (LPL ). LPL helps 
break down triglycerides , which are stored in round particles  made of protein and fat 
called lipoproteins . The body uses lipoproteins to  transport  fat after consuming food. 
In people with FCS,  LPL is missing  or does not work  well, and the body is unable to 
break down  triglycerides  and process fat.  This causes the body to have high  levels  of 
lipoproteins containing  fats, which means people with FC S must continuously adhere 
to an extremely strict low -fat diet. 
 
People with FCS have [ADDRESS_255797] of olezarsen  on triglyceride  levels 
and what  side effects  it may cause . Researchers also wanted to learn if treatment with  
olezarsen reduced the occurrence of pancreatitis  events . 
 
When was this study done?  
This study started in  November 2020  and ended in October 2023 . 
 
Who took part in this study?  
Participants could take part if:  
• At least 18 years old  
• Had FCS  
• During screening  (determining eligibility) , had a triglyceride  level of at least 880 
milligrams per deciliter  (mg/dL) after fasting (not eating) . A milligram is one -
thousandth of a gram. A gram is about 1/30 of an ounce. A deciliter measure 
fluid volume that is 1/10 liter. A liter is a little bigger than a quart . 
Participants could not take part if they:  
• Had acute coronary syndrome, or conditions that reduced or stopped blood flow 
to the heart , within 6 months of starting the study  
• Had major surgery within 3 months of starting the study  
• Had other conditions that the researchers believed would interfere with the 
study  
For more information on who could take part in this study, please refer to the websites 
listed at the end of this summary.  
 
How many people took part in this study?  
Altogethe r, 66 participants took part in this study, of whom 28 were men (42%)  and 38 
were women (58%) . Participants were between [ADDRESS_255798] , 
Portugal, Slovakia, Spain,  Sweden, the [LOCATION_008] , and the [LOCATION_002] .

 What happened during the study?  
What did researchers want to know?  
Researchers wanted to know  how well olezarsen  worked to lower triglyceride  levels  in 
the blood of participants with FCS.   
The main question researchers wanted to answer was:  
How did triglyceride  levels change after 6 months of treatment in participants 
who took olezarsen compared with those who took placebo?   
To address this question, r esearchers took blood samples and compared  triglyceride  
levels at the start of the study to triglyceride  levels after [ADDRESS_255799] 10 hours before each blood sample was tak en. 
What treatment s were studied?  
• Olezarsen , 50 or 80 milligrams (mg), given as an injection  under the skin  
(subcutaneous).  
• Placebo, given as an injection under the skin . Both olezarsen and placebo were 
injected once every 4 weeks .  
How was the study done?  
There are many types of clinical studies. This study was:  
• Phase 3: This is usually the last phase of clinical study before a new drug is 
submitted to government authoriti es for approval.  A study at this phase is used  
to confirm the effect of a drug and learn more about how safe and tolerable  it is. 
• Randomized: Who got which dose of olezarsen or placebo was decided 
randomly by a computer program.  
• Placebo -controlled: Researchers  used a placebo to learn the effect of 
olezarsen.  
• Double -Blind: Neither researchers nor participants knew who was getting 
olezarsen or placebo.  
Before the study began, all participants were screened (evaluated) to  be sure they 
were a good fit for the study.  
Screening  Period  
• During the screening, p articipants were placed on a stable low-fat diet during 
the first  [ADDRESS_255800] of the study.  
• The screening included laboratory tests, physical tests, and genetic tests for 
FCS.  The participants were also asked to answer  a set of questions  
(questionnaires)  to check their disease state  and quality of life .  
• The screening lasted for 4 to 8 weeks .

 Treatment Period  
• Following the screening period, participants were placed into 1 of 2 groups.  
• Group 1 received either 50 mg olezarsen or a matching placebo  once every 4 
weeks . Group 2 received 80 mg olezarsen or  a matching  placebo  also once 
every 4 weeks . 
o Group 1 had 22 participants receiving olezarsen 80 mg  
o Group 2 had 21 participants receiving o lezarsen 50 mg  
o Groups 1 and 2 had a t otal of 23 participant receiving placebo  
• Durin g the treatment, blood samples were collected every 4 weeks  to check for 
the levels of triglycerides  in the blood.  
• Participants also completed questionnaires to check their own  state and 
symptoms of the disease.  They recorded any medical problems they had 
during the treatment.  
• The treatment period lasted for 52 weeks (1 year) .  
Follow -up Period  
• After ending  their treatment, participants entered a  13-week follow -up period  or 
an extension study  if they  completed the entire year of treatment . 
• The extension study  allowed  researchers to collect more information on the 
safety and effectiveness  of olezarsen .  
• Those participants who did not move onto  the extension study were followed up 
every 4 weeks  of the 13-week  follow -up period  to check the safety and 
effectiveness of olezarsen.  
Participants had check -up visits at the  study  clinic, both during  treatment  and for up to 
13 weeks after treatment. Rese archers observed participants’ health and checked for 
any side effects.  
 
What were the results  of the study ? 
The results below include  all [ADDRESS_255801] 1 dose of olezarsen  
or placebo.  
How did the triglyceride  levels change after 6 months  of treatment  in participants 
who took olezarsen compared to those who took  placebo?  
Researchers wanted to compare the change in fasted triglyceride  levels from the start 
of the study between the olezarsen and placebo  groups .  
After 6 months :  
• The triglyceride  levels in the participants who received  80 mg  of olezarsen 
decreased  by 44%  compared with placebo .  
• The triglyceride  levels  in the participants who received  50 mg  of olezarsen  
decreased by 22% compared with place bo.

 Researchers considered the change in the participants who received  80 mg of 
olezarsen to be meaningful.  Results in the group of participants that received 80 mg of 
olezarsen every 4 weeks had a reduction in triglyceride levels that were statistically 
significant  from placebo . Statistical significance means that the numbers are reliably 
different, greatly aid ing in data analysis . The participants  who received 50 mg of 
olezarsen every 4 weeks  had a reduction in triglyceride levels, but compared with 
placebo , was not statistically significant . 
How did the occurrence of  pancreatitis  change after 1 year of treatme nt in 
participants who took olezarsen compared to those who took  placebo?  
Researchers wanted to compare the occrence  of pancreatitis from the start of the study 
between the olezarsen and placebo groups.  
After 1 year  there was  an 88% decrease in occurence of  pancreatitis in participants 
that received olezarsen compared with placebo.  Researchers considered th is change 
to be meaningful.

How has this study helped patients and researchers?  
Researchers look at the results of many studies to decide which medicines work and 
are safe st for pa rticipants . This summary gives the results of [ADDRESS_255804] more  participants  and may give different results.  
Overall, researchers learned that olezarsen 80 mg led to a meaningful  reduction in the 
levels of triglyceride s in the blood after treatment. Researchers also found no new 
serious safety concerns  with olezarsen . 
Findings  from this study may be used in other studies to learn more about the use of 
olezarsen  in participants  with FCS.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1. Overview of Disease  
Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) is an inherited disease characterized by [CONTACT_37756].  It is a rare autosomal recessive disease that can be 
diagnosed either in childhood or adulthood.  
FCS is characterized by [CONTACT_213300], repetitive colicky pain, repeated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_37520], and in children, can result in a failure to thrive 
(Brunzell 1999 ; Tremblay et al. 201 1).  Physical examination frequently reveals eruptive 
xanthomas, lipemia retinalis and hepatosplenomegaly, and plasma from patients appears 
lactescent, interfering with determination of other laboratory parameters (Trembla y et al. 2011 ).  
Fasting plasma TG levels in FCS patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 10 -fold to 100 -fold above normal 
(1,500  to 15,000 mg/dL), despi[INVESTIGATOR_37452] (20 g or approximately 15 -20% 
of daily calorie intake) (Brunzell 1999 ). 
Patients with FCS often present in infancy or childhood with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_213260], eruptive xanthomas or hepatomegaly.  The diagnosis of FCS is then 
established by [CONTACT_37688][INVESTIGATOR_213261] (LPL) enzyme 
activity in post -heparin plasma (Brunzell 1999 ). 
Patients with FCS carry a heavy burden of medical complications, the most serious being an 
extreme risk of recurrent and potentially fatal pancreatitis.  Due to the recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_213262], these patients may also develop chronic pancreatitis and signs of exocrine or 
endocrine pancreatic insufficiency, including diabetes mellitus (Gaudet et al. 2013 ).  Whi le the 
pathophysiology underlying chylomicron -related pancreatitis has not been completely 
elucidated, one hypothesis is that large chylomicrons lodged in pancreatic capi[INVESTIGATOR_37672], resulting in release of free fatty acids thr ough the hydrolysis of 
chylomicron -associated TGs.  High concentrations of free fatty acids are thought to damage 
pancreatic cells leading to emergent pancreatitis (Yang et al. 2009 ; Berglund e t al. 2012 ). 
FCS significantly affects patients’ HRQoL.  Bloating, generalized abdominal pain, asthenia, 
anxiety about potential painful attacks and overall health, difficulty concentrating and “brain 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255841]  2023  
 
24  fog” are commonly reported symptoms of FCS.  The psyc hosocial burden of FCS is also 
increased by [CONTACT_213301] (Davidson et al. 2017 ; Gelrud et al. 2017 ; Davidson et al. 2018 ; Fox et al. 2020 ). 
The etiology of  extreme hypertriglyceridemia in FCS is considered to be ineffective TG 
clearance, due to an extremely low level of LPL activity.  LPL normally fu nctions to hydrolyze 
TGs in chylomicrons along the luminal surface of capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], mainly in heart, skeletal muscle, 
and adipose tissue, promoting TG clearance from the circulation.  LPL is regulated by a number 
of key genes, and loss -of-function mutations  in one of these genes, or the LPL gene itself, results 
in FCS (Surendran et al. 2012 ).  In addition to loss of function mutations, null mutations, and 
nonsense mutations in the LPL gene, other genes currently identified i n FCS patients, and known 
to directly influence LPL activity include:  apolipoprotein C -II (APOC2) a cofactor for LPL 
(Schuster et al. 2011 ); apolipoprotein A -V (APOA5) (Schaap et al. 2004 ); lipase maturation 
Factor 1 (LMF1), a transmembrane protein involved in LPL maturation (Doolittle et al. 2009 ), 
glycosylphosphotidylinositol -anchored HDL -binding protein 1 (GP1HBP1), a capi[INVESTIGATOR_37553] a platform for LPL -mediated processing of chylomicrons 
(Beigneux et al. 2007 ). 
2.2. Therapeutic Rational e 
Apolipoprotein C -III (ApoC -III), a key regulator of plasma TG levels, is a 79 amino acid 
glycoprotein synthesized principally in the liver (Gordts et al. 2016 ), (Figure  1).  ApoC -III is a 
major regulator of lipoprotein metabolism and plays a pi[INVESTIGATOR_37496] 
(Chan et al. 2008 ).  It is a component of TG -rich lip oproteins (TRLs) and a potent inhibitor of 
LPL (Lemieux et al. 2003 ).  At higher concentrations apoC -III also inhibits hepatic lipase 
activity (Kinnunen and Ehnolm 1976 ), an enzyme which p lays an important role in the 
conversion of dense very low -density lipoprotein (VLDL) to intermediate density 
lipoprotein  (IDL) and to low -density lipoprotein (LDL) (Mann et al. 1997 ; Brown et al. 2010 ; 
Mendivil et al. 2010 ), as well as in the remodeling of HDL (Brown et al. 2010 ).  In addition, 
increased apoC -III content adversely affects apoE -mediated hepatic uptake of TG -rich remnants 
(Mann et al. 1997 ).  Thus, elevated plasma apoC -III levels are associated with impaired 
hydrolysis and retarded clearance of TG -rich particles, resulting in the accumulation of v ery 
low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL -TG) and chylomicrons in plasma and the 
development of hypertriglyceridemia (Ito et al. 1990 ).

Figure  1: A Schematic Overview of the Pos sible Effects of ApoC -III on TRL 
Metabolism  
From (Gordts et al. 2016 ); apoC -III = apolipoprotein CIII, CR = chylomicron remnant, HL = hepatic lipase, 
IDL = intermediate -density lipoprotein, LDL = low -density lipoprotein, L DLR = LDL receptor, 
LPL = lipoprotein  lipase, LRP1 = low -density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1, SDC1 = syndecan -1, 
VLDL  = very low -density lipoprotein.  
 
Mechanistically, FCS is primarily a consequence of ineffective clearance of TRL.  ApoC -III is a 
prominent component of TRL (e.g., VLDL and chylomicrons).  In addition to its role in 
inhibiting LPL, apoC -III inhibits TRL remnant (TG -depleted remnant lipoprotein) uptake by 
[CONTACT_37842].  
Human genetic data have demonstrated positive phenotype associations with loss (e.g., null or 
nonsense mutations) and negative effects with gain of function mutations (Atzmon et al. 2006 ; 
Pollin et al. 2008 ; Petersen et al. 2010 ).  A novel nonsense mutation in the APOC3 gene was 
identified in the heritability and phenotype intervention (HAPI) heart study in Old Order Amish 
that results in lower plasma apoC -III and TG levels and lower LDL -C, increased HDL -C and 
reduced atherosclero sis (Pollin et al. 2008 ).  In another study involving a group of 
214 Ashkenazi Jews of advanced age (had passed or nearly reached 100 years of age), genotype 
analysis revealed a polymorphism in the apoC -III gene (APOC3 -641CC genotype) with a clear 
pattern of age -dependent frequency that was associated with significantly lower levels of 

ISIS [ADDRESS_255843]  2023  
 
26  apoC -III protein, a favorable lipoprotein profile and increased longevity (Atzmon et al. 2006 ).  In 
contras t to the Amish and Ashkenazi apoC -III polymorphisms associated with lower plasma TG, 
apoC -III polymorphisms associated with higher plasma TG have also been described (Petersen et 
al. 2010 ).  In a cohort of lean (mean body mass index [BMI] = 24.7 ± 3.6 kg/m2) Asian Indians, 
carriers of apoC -III variant alleles (C -482T, T -455C, or both) were noted to have significantly 
higher plasma apoC -III and TG levels, and decreased ability to clear postprandial TG from the 
circulation.  Taken together, the available data strongly support the development of a therapy that 
reduces plasma apoC -III levels in order to reduce the very high circulating TG and chylomicron 
levels that are accompanied by [CONTACT_37690].  
The mechanistic data available to date on apoC -III function indicates that lowering apoC -III will 
produce clinically relevant reductions in TGs as observed with ISIS [ADDRESS_255844] activity  (Witztum et al. 2019 ).  Therefore, 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255845] the 
potential to reduce events of pancreatitis in this patient population.  To this end, volanesorsen 
was granted approval in the European Union on 3 May 2019.  
2.3. ISIS  678354  
ISIS 678354 is an antisense oligo nucleotide (ASO) inhibitor of apoC -III production.  
Specifically, ISIS  678354 is a second -generation 2ʹ -O-methoxyethyl chimeric ASO covalently 
bound to triantenary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc 3), a high affinity ligand f or 
the hepatocyte -specific asialog lycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) (Prakash et al. 2014 ).  The ASO 
portion of ISIS  678354, volanesorsen, is designed to bind to the human apoC -III messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and has demonstrated robust pharmacology in hea lthy 
volunteers  and patients, including patients with the most severe form of hypertriglyceridemia, 
FCS (Graham et al. 2013 ; Gaudet et al. 2014 ; 2015 ).  ISIS 678354, having a GalNAc 3 conjugate, 
targets the ASGPR to dramatically increase uptake of the ASO to hepatocytes, thereby 
[CONTACT_213302] -III over the unconjugated parent molecule, 
ISIS 304801.  ISIS  678354, therefore, has th e potential to lower apoC -III and TG with an 
enhanced tolerability profile over the parent molecule, ISIS  304801.  
2.3.1.  Mechanism of Action  
The hybridization (binding) of ISIS 678354 to the cognate mRNA results in the 
RNase  H1-mediated degradation of the apoC -III mRNA, thus preventing production of the 
apoC -III protein.  Maximal antisense -mediated reduction of target mRNA levels is typi[INVESTIGATOR_213263] 90% of control levels in sensitive tissues (Bennett 2007 ; Zhang et al. 2010 ).  
Furthermore, reduction in target mRNA levels using this approach correlates directly with a 
subsequent reduction in target protein levels.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255846]  2023  
 
27  2.3.2.  Chemistry  
Chemically, ISIS  678354 is a synthetic oligomer of 20 nucleotides (i.e., a 20-mer) that are 
connected sequentially by [CONTACT_37693], with a 5′ -trishexylamino -(THA) -
C6GalNAc 3 endcap.  
The nucleotide sequence of ISIS  678354 ( Figure  2) is fully complementary to base -pair positions 
489-508 (within the 3′ non -translated sequence of the apoC -III mRNA) and binds to the mRNA 
by [CONTACT_213303] -Crick base pairing.  Based on  in silico  analysis, it is not predicted to target any other 
human gene.  Structurally, the oligonucleotide has 4 regions.  Two (2) of them, the 5 nucleotides 
at the 5′ end and the 5 nucleotides at the 3′ end are composed of 2′ -O-(2-methoxyethyl) 
(2′-MOE) -modified ribonucleotides.  These MOE -modified nucleotides confer (1) increased 
affinity for the target mRNA (Altmann et al. 1996 ; McKay et al. 1999 ), (2) increased resistance 
to exonucle ases and endonucleases (thereby [CONTACT_37759]) (Geary et al. 2003 ), 
and (3) amelioration of some of the high -dose toxicities thereby [CONTACT_213304] -modified 
oligodeoxynucleotides (DNA) (Henry et al. 2000 ).  The third region, the central portion of the 
oligonucleotide, is composed of 10 oligodeoxynucleotides.  This chimeric desi gn is called a 
MOE -gapmer, and ISIS 678354 employs this chimeric structure to enable use of the 
RNase  H1-mechanism for antisense activity.  This is because while the 2 ′-MOE modification 
confers increased stability and affinity, it does not support RNase H1 -catalyzed cleavage of RNA 
hybridized to 2 ′-MOE -modified nucleotides (McKay et al. 1999 ).  This is caused by 
[CONTACT_37802] 2 ′-alkoxy:RNA hybrids that are not 
recognized by [CONTACT_37695] H1 e nzymes (Inoue et al. 1987 ; Monia et al. 1993 ).  By [CONTACT_37761] 
2′-MOE modification to nucleotides flanking the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide core, 
the beneficial attributes of the 2 ′-MOE chemistry are preserved while also retaining RNase  H1 
recognition.  
The fourth region is comprised of a cluster of GalNAc 3 sugars which is linked to the 5 ′-end of 
ISIS 678354 via a phosphodiester linkage.  The GalNAc 3 cluster is a high affinity ligand for the 
ASGPR, a receptor expressed primarily on the surface of liver hepatocytes (Stockert 1995 ).  The 
GalNAc 3 cluster enhances delivery of ISIS  678354 to liver hepatocytes over other ce ll types and 
enhances potency.  After internalization into cells, the GalNAc 3 cluster is metabolized to release 
‘free ASO’ inside the cell (Prakash et al. 2014 ).

2.3.3.  Preclinical Experience  
Detailed information concerning the preclinical studies conducted with ISIS 678354  can be 
found in the Investigator’s B rochure.  
General toxicology and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies for ISIS  678354 included sub -chronic 
(13-week repeat -dose studies with a 13 -week recovery) and chronic (26 -week in mice with a 
13-week recovery and 39 -week in monkey  with a 26 -week recovery) toxi city studies.  
ISIS 838707 (mouse -specific apoC -III inhibitor) was also included in the chronic toxicity study 
in mice to evaluate any potential toxicity associated with apoC -III inhibition.  The following 
findings in the ISIS 678354 mouse and monkey studi es are considered non -specific class effects 
related to the uptake and accumulation of 2′ -MOE ASOs, and the targeted delivery of ASO to the 
hepatocytes by [CONTACT_213305] 3 conjugate which results in higher hepatocellular concentrations 
compared to unconjugated 2′-MOE ASOs.  This is most apparent in mice at doses of 20 and 
24 mg/kg/wk and in monkey at doses of 12 and 30  mg/kg/wk.  
• dose-dependent microscopic findings related to ASO tissue accumulation included 
the presence of basophilic granules in various tissues in mice and monkeys (liver, 
kidney, lymph node, bone marrow and skin/injection sites) resulting in adaptive 
responses such as hypertrophy and/or vacuolation at 30 mg/kg/wk.  
• in mice, dose -dependent increases in mitotic figures, cytoplasmic alteration and 
karyomegaly of hepatocytes and/or infiltration by [CONTACT_213306]/granular macrophages 
predominantly at ≥ 6 mg/kg/wk (~50 to ~100 mg/wk human equivalent dose (HED) 
assuming 70 kg human body weight and 5 - to 8-fold scaling factor for mouse plasma 
PK established fo r 2′-MOE ASO; (Yu et al. 2015 ), and mild -to-occasionally marked 
increases in ALT (~6.5 -fold over control) and/or AST (~2.6 -fold over control) 
predominantly at 20 mg/kg/wk (~165 to 350 mg/wk HED).  Individual hepatocellular

≥ 6 mg/kg/wk (420 mg/wk HED assuming [ADDRESS_255850] 
scaling to humans on the basis of body weight) after 39 weeks of treatment with no 
microscopic correlates.  
• pro-inflammatory changes in mice and monkeys after up to 26 and 39 weeks of 
treatment, respectively, included slight increases in liver weights (up to ~1.6 - and up 
to ~2.1 -fold over control) mainly at ≥ 6 and ≥ 12 mg/kg/wk in mice and monkeys, 
respectively.  Increased spleen weights (up to ~1.9 - and up to ~2.5 -fold over control) 
were also observed mainly at ≥ 6 and ≥ 12 mg/kg/wk in mice and monkeys, 
respectively.  In mice, increased MCP -1 (up to 7.7 -fold over control) was 
accompanied by [CONTACT_213307] -organ vacuolated/granular macrophage 
infiltrates in the 20 mg/kg/wk dose group.  
• in monkeys, sporadic incidences of minimal to marked mononuclear cell infiltration 
at injection site skin were seen in all dose groups.  
The most noteworthy finding in the monkey study was a marked platelet (PLT) reduct ion, which 
occurred in 1  male monkey at the mid -high dose level, 12 mg/kg/wk (840 mg/wk HED).  At 
Day 65, this animal presented with petechia and oral mucosal bleeding with a PLT count of 
8 × 103/μL.  This animal was treated with methylprednisolone on Days  65 and 72, and the PLT 
count quickly recovered to 145  × 103/μL on Day 70.  This animal continued treatment with 
ISIS 678354, without a dosing holiday, until scheduled necropsy on Day 93 (interim) with the 
last clinical pathology evaluation on Day 93 again  showing a marked reduction in PLT count 
(6 × 103/μL).  Marked PLT reductions were not observed in the 30 mg/kg/wk dose group 
(2100  mg/wk HED) for up to 13 weeks or in any of the remaining dose groups for up to 
39 weeks.  
In vivo  safety pharmacology and in vitro  genetic toxicity studies indicate that ISIS 678354:  
• had no effects on cardiovascular (blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], ECG), 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], arterial blood gases), or central nervous system (CNS) 
parameters in the monkey consist ent with previous experience with 2ʹ -MOE ASOs

• was not genotoxic and did not increase the rate of mutations in the in vitro  bacterial 
reverse mutation assay nor induce chromosomal abnormalities in mammali an cells.  
2.3.4.  Clinical Experience  
Detailed information concerning the clinical studies conducted with ISIS  678354 can be found in 
the Investigator’s Brochure.  A summary of the studies that has been conducted with 
ISIS 678354 is included below.  
ISIS 678354 -CS1 was a Phase 1, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -escalation study 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of single and multiple doses of ISIS  678354 
administered by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection to healthy subjects (age 18 to 65).   In the 
single -ascending dose (SAD) part of the study, 5 dose levels (10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 mg) were 
evaluated sequentially.  In the multiple -ascending dose (MAD) part, 2 dose levels ([ADDRESS_255851]  2023  
 
30  30 mg) were evaluated at weekly dosing for 6 weeks and 1 dose level (60 mg) was evaluated at 
every -4-week dosing for 3 months.  The SAD and weekly MAD dose levels were studied in a 
cohort of 8 subjects, where 6 were randomized to active treatment with ISIS 678354 and 2 were 
randomized to placebo.  In the every -4-week  MAD cohort 10 subjects were studied (6 active and 
4 placebo).  In the 90 and 120 mg SAD and all of the MAD cohorts, the pharmacodynamic 
effects of ISIS  678354 vs. placebo were examined in healthy subjects with elevated triglycerides 
(TG > 200 mg/dL).  
Resu lts from the SAD portion of the Phase 1 study showed significant dose -dependent sustained 
reductions in fasting total apoC -III and TG levels.  ApoC -III reductions of -4%, -32%, -65%,  
-78%, and -91%, and TG reductions of -12%, -11%, -43%, -68%, and -77% wer e observed with 
single doses of 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 mg of ISIS  678354, respectively, 14 days after dosing.  In 
the MAD cohorts, mean apoC -III reductions of -65%, -84%, and -83% and mean TG reductions 
of -61%, -71%, and -65% were observed in the [ADDRESS_255852] dose.  Significant dose -dependent reductions of 
up to ~ -30% in apoB and increases of up to ~100% in HDL -C were also observed.  There were 
no notable increases in LDL -C in any dose group.  Effects were sustained for at least [ADDRESS_255853] dose, consistent with the drug’s long terminal elimination half -life. 
Overall, ISIS  678354 was well -tolerated and there were no safety concerns.  There were no 
deaths, no seriou s AEs (SAE) related to ISIS 678354, no AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, and no clinically significant trends in laboratory assessments observed in any of 
the ISIS  678354 Phase 1 dose groups.  Two (2) of 6 subjects receiving ISIS  678354 every 
4 weeks, each experienced ALT increased ([ADDRESS_255854] of moderate severity) and 
single events of AST increased.  These events were considered possibly related to Study Drug 
and were the only events experienced by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_255855] or ALT.  There were no other 
treatment -related laboratory abnormalities in the liver, kidney function or platelet counts and no 
clinically signific ant changes in vital signs or ECGs in any cohort studied.  
The Phase 2 study was a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose-ranging study.  A total of 114 patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), or 
being at risk for CV D, with fasting TG levels of ≥  200 mg/dL and ≤  500 mg/dL, and on 
standard -of-care preventative therapy for their known CVD risk factors were randomly assigned 
to 1 of the 4 parallel dosing cohorts, with each cohort having a 4:1 ratio to receive ISIS  678354  
or matching volume of placebo, respectively, by [CONTACT_213308] 12 months.  The study 
evaluated 3 different doses of ISIS  678354: 10, 15, and 50 mg, and 3 different dosing regimens: 
weekly, every 2 weeks, and every 4 weeks (Q4W).  The range of dosi ng covered the equivalent 
monthly drug exposure of [ADDRESS_255856]  2023  
 
31  was at Week 25 for patients who received every 4 -week dosing and at Week 27 for patients who 
received every 2 -week or weekly dosing.  
Mean (95%CI) exposure to ISIS 678354 was 243.7 (222, 265) days.  Treatment compliance was 
high (over 90%) in all treatment groups.  Mean (standard deviation [SD]) baseline TG level for 
all 114 randomized patients was 284.7 (85.10) mg/dL, almost 2 times exceeding upper normal 
level of 149 mg/dL.  
The study met the primary efficacy endpoint.  Sign ificant reductions in fasting TG levels from 
Baseline to the primary analysis time point were observed in all ISIS [ADDRESS_255857] dose group (50 mg Q4W) achieved mean 62% reduction from 
Baseline in fasting TG levels  compared to placebo, associated with mean 74% reduction from 
Baseline in apoC -III levels.  The proportion of patients achieving normal fasting TG levels 
< 150 mg/dL showed a significant, dose -dependent increase in all ISIS 678354 treated groups 
with over 90% (20/22) patients treated with the highest dose of 50 mg Q4W vs. only 4.2% (1/24) 
patients treated with placebo achieving this threshold.  
ISIS 678354 was well -tolerated and there were no safety concerns.  Overall incidence and 
severity of treatment -emer gent adverse event (TEAEs) “on -treatment” (defined as period from 
first dose through [ADDRESS_255858] dose) were comparable between the pooled placebo 
group and the pooled ISIS  [ADDRESS_255859] frequently reported TEAE in the 
pooled ISIS  678354 group was injection site erythema (15.6%) .  Treatment emergent SAEs were 
experienced by 4.2% patients in the placebo group and 10.0% patients in the pooled ISIS  678354 
group, none of them was considered related to the Study Drug.  Treatment discontinuations due 
to TEAEs were very infrequent (overall 3 patients), and well -balanced between the pooled 
placebo group (4.2%) and the pooled ISIS  678354 group (2.2%).  
There was 1 death on the study in 15 mg Q2W ISIS  678354 group:  patient with advanced CVD 
and other medical history including coronary artery disease (with ST -elevation MI, CABG, 
multiple, 10 in total, stent placement), congestive heart failure, a ortic stenosis, carotid artery 
disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, died at home, no autopsy performed, death was considered 
as “heart related”.  
ISIS 678354 was well -tolerated, there was low incidence of predominantly mild injection site 
reactions (12.2%  vs. 4.2%), and flu -like reactions (8.9% vs. 8.3%) in patients treated with 
ISIS 678354 compared to placebo, respectively.  
No dose - or time -dependent changes in platelet count were observed, and no patient had a 
confirmed platelet count < 100,000/ mm3.  The  incidence of minor bleeding events was 
comparable between the pooled placebo group (20.8%) and the pooled ISIS  678354 group 
(12.2%).  No patient met any liver monitoring rules including increase in ALT or AST 
> 3 × ULN, or >  2× baseline (if baseline >  × ULN).  The incidence of patients meeting any renal 
monitoring rules (decrease from Baseline in Estimated GFR  [eGFR] >  25%, increase in serum 
creatinine >  0.3 mg/dL, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) >  250 mg/g, urine 
protein/creatinine ratio, (UPCR) >  500 mg/g) was comparable between the pooled placebo group 
(20.8%) and the pooled ISIS 678354 group (17.8%).  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255860]  2023  
 
32  Treatment with AKCEA -APOCIII -LRx was not associated with any  clinically significant changes 
in other laboratory parameters (including coagulation pan el, and inflammatory marker, hsCRP), 
vital signs, or ECG parameters.  
2.4. Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Administration  
The starting dose and dosing regimens selected for this study are [ADDRESS_255861] 
proportion of FCS patients to get below the pancreatitis threshold of 750 mg/dL .  The 
APPROACH trial demonst rated that volanesorsen mediated lowering of plasma 
apolipoprotein  C-III levels in subjects with FCS effectively lowered plasma TGs below the 
threshold of 750 mg/dL that has been associated with TG -induced acute pancreatitis (Berglund et 
al. 2012 ; Brown et al. 2012 ; Scherer et al. 2014 ; Valdivielso et al. 2014 ; Brahm and Hegele 
2015 ; Jacobson et al. 2015 ; Catapano et al. 2016 ; Witztum et al. 2019 ).  Based on preclinical 
pharmacodynamic  data with ISIS 678354, a dose of 80 mg will likely maintain TG levels below 
750 mg/dL in a statistically significant number of subjects.  This opportunity to achieve a TG 
level below 750 mg/dL will help maximize the opportunity to provide a potential impa ct on the 
risk of pancreatitis.  
In nonclinical studies, ISIS  [ADDRESS_255862] Level (NOAEL) was defined by [CONTACT_213309] .  The safety margins between the NOAEL in monkeys and the clinically relevant 
exposure are based on cu mulative plasma AUC measurements  (Yu et al. 2015 ) or mg/kg scaling 
(FDA 2005 ; Geary et al. 1997 ).  The NOAEL in monkeys was determined to be 6  mg/kg/wk 
(1680 mg/month HED assuming 70  kg human body weight; AUC 0-48:  141  µg·h/mL).  This 
NOAEL is approximately  21-fold above the current highest proposed clinical dose 
(80 mg/month: estimated AUC 0-tau:  6.7  µg·h/mL).  Clinical safety data to date suggest that 
ISIS 678354 has been well -tolerated at dose levels up to 30  mg every week (equivalent to 
120 mg every 4 weeks) in patients with high TGs with the most common AEs being local to the 
injection site and predominantly mild.  A pooled analysis of safety for the Phas e 1 and Phase  2 
studies did not demonstrate any clear difference in safety or tolerability between the different 
doses tested (Phase 1:  10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, and 120 mg single dose, and 15  mg and 
30 mg per week for 6 weeks (i.e., 60 mg and 120 mg cu mulative monthly equivalents, 
respectively), and 60  mg every 4 -weeks for 13 weeks.  Phase 2:  [ADDRESS_255863] 6 months and up to 1 year).  
Analysis of the cohorts in which ISIS  [ADDRESS_255864] between the different doses in the 10 mg to 
120 mg per month e quivalent dose range as compared to placebo.  Considering the medical need 
for FCS patients with extremely high TG levels, often > 2000 mg/dL, achieving a maximal TG 
reduction over 70%, the level of reduction observed for volanesorsen at [ADDRESS_255865]  2023  
 
33  pancreatitis.  Population PK/PD model -based simulations for a population of FCS patients 
predicted 70% reduction in TGs and 86% reduction in apo -CIII for 80 mg ever y 4-week dosing.  
In addition to the nonclinical and clinical experience of ISIS  678354, the dose and schedule of 
administration is supported by [CONTACT_37678] 
2′-MOE -modified, GalNAc 3-conjugated ASOs that ha ve been safely administered SC in multiple 
clinical studies at doses up to 120 mg weekly for 12 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
and 20  mg weekly for up to 51 weeks (Tsimikas et al. 2020 ).  The most advanced 
GalNAc 3-conjugated ASO (ISIS  681257; NVS TQJ230) of similar chemistry has entered into a 
large Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (HORIZON, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of 7600 subjects to be treated 
for a median of 4 years at a once -monthly dose of 80  mg every 4 -week dosing.  Cumulati ve 
safety and tolerability data from the platform as well as the preclinical and clinical experience for 
ISIS 678354 are supportive of this dose and dosing frequency (Crooke et al. 2018 ).  Patients with 
FCS will require ch ronic treatment and therefore an every 4 -week dosing regimen may provide 
advantages over weekly dosing in terms of convenience and compliance for patients.  
2.5. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
2.5.1.  Overall Assessment of Benefit:Risk  
The benefits of treatment of ISIS  [ADDRESS_255866] been identified with ISIS 678354 in the Phase  1 (678354 -CS1) or 
Phase  2 (678354 -CS2) studies .  The conjugated nature of ISIS  678354 allows specific targeting 
of ASO to hepatocytes so, that for similar hepatocyte exposure, reduced exposure to both 
non-parenchymal liver cells and systemic exposure has the potential to lower apoC -III and TGs 
with an enhanced tolerability profile over the parent molecule, ISIS  304801.  Consequently, 
platelet count decreases observed with the much higher doses of the unconjugated parent 
molecule are not anticipated to occur at the dose tested in this study.  
Neve rtheless, regular monitoring of platelet counts,  liver chemistry, and renal function, and 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213264]  8.5 and Section  8.6. 
Taking into account the measures implemented to minimize risk to patients participating in this 
study, the pote ntial risks identified in association with ISIS  678354 are justified by [CONTACT_213310].  
Detailed information concerning the benefit -risk assessment of ISIS 678354  can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.5.2.  Additional Risks During the COVID -[ADDRESS_255867] been identified that would cause termination of treatment during the COVID -19 
Pandemic  (Iqbal et al. 2020 ) at this time.  
There could be risk however, for patients who are p articipating in a clinical trial such as 
ISIS 678354.  There may be risks to patients traveling to research sites.   Sites should follow their 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255868]  2023  
 
34  specific regional guidance (i.e., institutional, local, state, federal, country -level, as applicable) 
with regard to receiving patients for clinical trials.   Visits should continue as long as it is deemed 
safe to do so.  Provision will be available for patients to be treated or evaluated in their homes by 
a home healthcare professional.  Additional mitigation steps an d a study pause may be necessary 
as conditions warrant.   If a study patient becomes infected with COVID -19 or develop 
COVID -19-related symptoms, the patient should notify the study staff/Investigator and notify 
their treating Physician that they are partic ipating in a clinical trial with ISIS  678354.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study.  Eligible patients will 
enter an approximately [ADDRESS_255869] 2 -week Diet Stabilization/Run -In Period for patients not already on a stable diet, and an 
approximately 2 -week Qualification Period.  Following qualification, approximately 60  eligible 
patients will be randomized 1:1 to Cohort A (50 mg) or Cohort B (80 mg) and each cohort 
further randomized 2:1 to receive ISIS  678354 or placebo in a 53 -week Treatment Period.  
Patients in Cohort A will receive 50 mg of ISIS  678354 once every 4 weeks or matching volume 
of placebo (0.5 mL) Weeks 1 -49 of the Treatment Period.  Patients in Cohort B will receive 
80 mg ISIS  678354 once every 4 weeks or matching volume of placebo (0.8 mL) Weeks 1 -49 of 
the Treatment Period.  Randomization will be stratified by (1) prior history of pancreatitis 
(within 10 years prior to Screening) and (2) previous treatment with volanesorsen.  Dietary 
coun seling will commence at the start of the Diet Stabilization Period and will be reinforced at 
intervals throughout the Treatment and Follow -up Period.  Following the Week [ADDRESS_255870] to enroll in an open -label extension (OLE) study  pending study approval by 
[CONTACT_21980]/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) and the appropriate 
regulatory authority.  Patients not participating in the OLE will enter the [ADDRESS_255871] patient has completed the Week  53/ET visit and will be based on the percent change in 
fasting TG from Baseline at the primary analysis time point (Month 6).  
The patients, Investigators, study staff, and the S ponsor are to remain blinded to lipid data 
(central and local) starting after the first dose on Day [ADDRESS_255872] of the following periods:  
• An approximately [ADDRESS_255873] 2 weeks and an approximately 2 -week 
Qualification Period (patients on stable diet, for optimal control of TGs and disease 
management, known to the Investigator and followed at the site may go from 
Screening to Qu alification without the Diet Run -In Period)  
• A 53 -week Treatment Period during which Study Drug will be administered as a once 
every 4 -week SC injection (Week 1 through Week 49)  
• A [ADDRESS_255874] to enroll in the OLE study 
pending study approval of this proposed study by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the appropriate regulatory  
authority.  
3.5. End-of-Study  
The End -of-Study is defined as last patient, last visit.  
For individual patients, End -of-Study is defined as completion of their last study visit.  
3.6. Data and Safety Monitoring Board or Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee  
An indepen dent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of expertise in medical 
specialties relevant to the safety of ASO drugs (hematology, hepatology, and nephrology) will be 
assembled to review safety, tolerability and efficacy (as needed) data collecte d on ISIS [ADDRESS_255875]  2023  
 
36  and controlled access to unblinded data are outlined in the DSMB Charter and Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
3.7. Allowances in the Circumstance of a Public Health Emergency  
If an investigative site or the clinical trial patients associated with that site experience a public 
health emergency, such as a pandemic, then throughout that time the following changes to what 
is written elsewhere in this protocol are permissible, at the discretion of the Investigator , 
provided that all ICH, GCP, and regulatory requirements associated with the study are still 
upheld.  These allowances may be implemented at any stage of the study:   Screenin g Period, 
Treatment Period, and Post -Treatment Period.  What is considered a public health emergency is 
based on circumstances and procedures at the site, and the judgment of the Investigator .  The 
time at which a public health emergency has resolved to su fficient extent such that these 
allowances are no longer applicable is based on the judgment of the Investigator  in consultation 
with the Medical Monitor.  
• Remote assessments and at -home visits :  Even when an investigative site remains 
open to clinical tria l patients coming on site, social distancing strategies may result in 
some patients being unwilling or unable to attend protocol -specific clinic visits.  For 
such reasons, scheduled clinic visits may be replaced by [CONTACT_213311] (via 
video  conference or telephone call) or at -home visits or a combination, provided that 
these are properly documented.   This may be accomplished by [INVESTIGATOR_136] -home visits by 
[CONTACT_213312], with incorporation of 
videoconference or telephone assessmen ts by [CONTACT_213313].  
• Randomization :  When a patient is found to be eligible for the study, the decision 
regarding if and when the patient will be randomized is based on the judgment of the 
Investigator  in consultation with the Medical Moni tor.  Randomization may be 
delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 1 month without rescreening.  
• Safety assessments :  Every effort should be made to continue performing safety 
assessments on schedule.  This may require remote assessments (e.g., for adverse 
events and concomitant medications) by [CONTACT_37714], and it may require at 
home visits (e.g., for blood draws, urine samples, physical examination, vital signs) 
by [CONTACT_213312].   Which safety assessments are 
considered critical, for examp le to support a decision on whether to administer the 
next scheduled dose of Study Drug  to a patient, is to be determined on a case -by [CONTACT_213314].  
• Reporting of protocol deviations :  All protocol deviations that are caused by a 
public health emergency should be documented as such; for example, include in the 
description of the protocol deviation that it is related to COVID -19.  The impact such 
protocol deviations had on the study is to be summarize d in the clinical study report.   
This summary is considered sufficient notification of the EC / IRB for minor protocol 
deviations that were caused by a public health emergency.  
• Laboratory assessments associated with primary or secondary endpoints :  Every 
effort should be made to perform the assessments on schedule.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255876]  2023  
 
37  • To support Study Drug administration at home , delivery of Study Drug  to the 
patient may be undertaken at the discretion of the Investigator , based on local and 
regional regulations for transporti ng investigational product.  
• Immunization of patients with a vaccine for COVID -19, or antiviral treatments 
under an emergency use authorization  for COVID -19, outside of a clinical trial , 
may occur while patients are on study, however it is preferable that a  separation of at 
least 7 days occurs between administration of the vaccine or antiviral and 
administration of Study Drug.  Adjustment of the schedule for monthly administration 
of Study Drug may be considered in order to achieve this separation.  In addit ion, 
Study Drug should not be injected into the same anatomical location as the vaccine 
for COVID -19. 
4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT  
4.1. Screening  
Before patients may be enrolled into the study, the Sponsor or designee requires a copy of the 
Study Center’s written IEC/IRB  approval of the protocol, informed consent form,  and all other 
patient directed information and/or recruitment material.  
Patients or their legally acceptable representatives must sign the consent form before any 
screening tests or assessments are performe d.  At the time of consent, the patient will be 
considered enrolled into the study and will be assigned a unique screening number before any 
study procedures, including screening procedures, are performed.  The screening number and 
patient identification n umber must remain constant throughout the entire trial.  Patients may be 
re-screened [ADDRESS_255877] been completed and after the 
Investigator has verified that they are eligible per criteria in Section  5.1 and Section  5.2.  No 
patient may begin treatme nt prior to randomization  and assignment of a unique patient 
identification number.  
Using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system, eligible patients will be randomized 
1:1 to Cohort A or Cohort B and each cohort further randomized  2:1 to receive IS IS 678354 or 
placebo.  Patients will be stratified for:  
• Prior history of pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening* vs. no history of 
pancreatitis or no history within 10 years prior to Screening  
• Previous treatment with volanesorsen (Yes vs. No)  
* History of pancreatitis is defined as a recorded diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213265].  
The randomization lists will be prep ared by [CONTACT_213315].  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255878] patient has 
completed the end of the treatment period (Week 53/ET) as described in th e Unblinding Plan.  
Those Sponsor representatives will no longer be involved in the conduct of the study after they 
have been unblinded.  
However, if a patient has suffered an SAE (as defined in Section  9.3.3 ), and/or when knowledge 
of the treatment assignment will impact the clinical management of the patient, the Investigator 
will have the ability to unblind the treatment assignment for that patient u sing the IRT.  
The Sponsor or designee will be informed of the unblinding of a subject within 24  hours.  An 
unblinded randomization schema will be maintained securely at the Sponsor’s designated 
vendor.  In addition, all suspected unexpected serious adverse  reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
unblinded by [CONTACT_213316] (see 
Section  9.2). 
Every reasonabl e attempt should be made to complete the early termination study procedures and 
observations (see Appendix  A) prior to unblinding, as knowledge of t he treatment arm could 
influence subject assessment.  
5. PATIENT ELIGIBILITY

from Screening to qualification without a 2 -week diet run-in.  At the qualification visit, TGs will 
be measured.  
Race & Ethnicity data will be collected as part of the demographic information for all screened 
patients during the Screening Period . 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255888] dose of Study Drug 
plus 1 dosing interval.  Patients will receive Study Drug administered by [CONTACT_213318] 
4 weeks for 49 weeks.  Collection and measurement of vital signs, physical examination results, 
ECGs, labora tory parameters ( Appendix  B), ISIS  678354 plasma concentrations, anti -drug 
antibody (ADA) and biomarker samples, patient reported outcome assessments,  AEs and 
concomitant medication/procedure information will be performed according to the Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix  A. 
6.1.3.  Post-Treatment Period  
After completion of the Week [ADDRESS_255889] to receive ISIS 678354 in the OLE study, pendi ng study 
approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the appropriate regulatory authority.  In this case, patients will 
need to sign the IRB/IEC approved informed consent.  Patients who complete Study Visit Week 
53, and meet eligibility requirements, may start the Treatme nt Period in the OLE study any time 
after the Week [ADDRESS_255890] taken for safety reaso ns, may 
be taken at any time, irrespective of fasting status, but no later than 7 days after the initial result 
is obtained.  During preparation for fasting samples, the patient can drink water and they should 
ensure that they consume sufficient water in o rder to not become dehydrated.  
If tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], hemolysis or quantity not sufficient) or 
missing, a repeat blood or urine specimen should be re -drawn as soon as possible (ideally within 
1 week).  
While on treatment, hemat ology samples will be collected at least every 14 days (±  2 days).  In 
the event that a hematology sample is unreportable (e.g., due to hemolyzed or clumped blood 
samples), patient dosing cannot continue until another sample (central or local) is repeated and 
determined not to have met a platelet stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
Investigators may, at their discretion, test specific laboratory parameters which may be prone to 
clotting, clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_213268] (e.g. , hematology samples) at their local laboratory, in addition 
to the required central laboratory samples.  In these instances, the local laboratory results should 
be recorded by [CONTACT_213319].  Assays which are blinded should not be 
locally tested and recorded into the database (e.g., lipid panel ). 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255891] ion testing will also be collected 
every 14 days (± 2 days) and sent to the central laboratory for analysis for the first 3 months of 
the study treatment, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period per Section  8.5.2 . 
While on treatment, liver function testing will also be collected every 14 days (± 2 days) and sent 
to the central laboratory for analysis for the first 3 months of the study treatment, and monthly 
thereafter during the Treatment Period per Section  8.5.1 . 
All lab samples are to be sent to the central laboratory by [CONTACT_213320].  Lab 
alerts issued will indicate the applicable protocol section to facilitate review and will be 
immediately and simultaneously sent by [CONTACT_213321], the Sponsor and the CRO 
Medical Monitors, the Sponsor Drug Safety Ph ysician, and the Clinical Trial Manager (CTM), 
and should be received by [CONTACT_77314] 2  days from sample collection.  All lab sample results 
from the site’s local laboratories are received by [CONTACT_213322]’ 
standard repor ting time, and should be entered as soon as possible (ideally within 1  week) into 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) to inform the Sponsor and CRO study monitoring 
teams.  
All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt)  by [CONTACT_122696], or designee, to ensure that the count has not met a dose interruption or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10035].  Any case of platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 accompanied by a major 
bleeding (MB) event or clinically relevant non -major bleed ing (CRNMB) event, or platelet count 
of < 25,000/mm3 independent of a MB or CRNMB event, is considered an AE of special interest 
(AESI) and must be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Section  9.3.[ADDRESS_255892] also be reviewed promptly  (within 48 hours of receipt) by 
[CONTACT_737], or designee, to ensure that the result has not met the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
All lab alerts received, including those related to platelet, liver, or renal function 
monitoring/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], are also reviewed pro mptly by [CONTACT_213323].  Within 24 hours of receiving an actionable lab 
alert the CRO Medical Monitor will communicate instructions to the Investigator and the study 
personnel by [CONTACT_213324] m the Safety Surveillance Form that needs to be completed and signed 
by [CONTACT_737]/study personnel and promptly returned to the Sponsor and CRO Medical 
Monitor.  In urgent cases, such as platelets results below 50,000/mm3, or liver or renal test resu lts 
reaching a critical stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], the Investigator must also be contact[CONTACT_3012].  
Further information on safety monitoring and actions to be taken by [CONTACT_213325]  8.5.[ADDRESS_255893]  2023  
 
44  6.2.2.  Physical Exams and Vital Signs  
Physical exams and vital signs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures 
(Appendix  A).  Vital signs should include weight, BP, puls e rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_37499].  Blood pressure and pulse rate will be recorded after the patient has been in a sitting 
position for at least 5 minutes.  Blood pressure should always be measured on the same arm 
(preferentially on the left ar m).  Height will be measured at Screening.  
6.2.3.  Electrocardiography  
Electrocardiography will be conducted at Screening, Day 1 (prior to the first dose of Study 
Drug), and again during the Treatment Period and at each post -treatment follow -up visit as 
outlined in Appendix  A. 
Electrocardiography will be recorded after the patient has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_42428] [ADDRESS_255894] -Treatment 
Follow -up Period as noted in the table in Appendix  C. 
6.2.5.  Patient Reported Outcomes Assessments  
All patients are to complete the FCS Symptoms Two Week Recall at Screening and the FCS 
Symptoms and diet questionnaire on a daily basis f or FCS symptoms/diet (minimum of 4 daily 
assessments per week) and every 4 weeks for FCS Impacts, and complete the PROMIS Adult 
Short Form v1.1 (Pain Interference 8a) every 4 weeks, for the duration of the study as outlined in 
Appendix  A.  Health -related quality of life (as measured by [CONTACT_112526] 29+2 Profile vs. 2.1) 
and an optional PROMIS® Short Form v2.0 – Cognitive  Function 4a will be assessed at Ba seline, 
3 months, 6 months and end of study.  Patient -reported global impression of severity (PGIS) will 
be administered at Baseline and every 4 weeks; the patient -reported global impression of change 
(PGIC) at 6 months and end of study.  Patient -reported global impression of severity and PGIC 
are administered for purposes of PRO validation and estimation of minimal important difference 
(MID).  
6.2.6.  Pancreatitis Medical History  
Patient records will be reviewed for incidents of acute pancreatitis occurring up to [ADDRESS_255895] refrain from sperm/egg donation and either be 
abstinent† or practice highly effective contraception from the time of signing the informed 
consent form until at least [ADDRESS_255896] dose of Study Drug.  
For the purposes of this study, females o f childbearing potential are defined as any female who 
has experienced menarche, and who does not meet one of the following conditions:  
• Postmenopausal:  12  months of spontaneous amenorrhea in females > 55 years of age 
or, in females ≤ 55 years, 12  months o f spontaneous amenorrhea without an 
alternative medical cause and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the 
laboratory involved  
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy  
• Post-hysterectomy  
For the purposes of the study,  highly effective contraception is defined as follows:  
For male patients:  
• Highly effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen 
analysis at follow -up, surgically sterile via bilateral orchidectomy , or the 
non-pregnant female partner of child -bearing potential uses a highly effective 
contraceptive method (defined below)  
For female patients and female partners of male patients, highly effective female contraception 
methods comprise:  
• Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusio n hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy ), hormonal contraception  associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (combined estrogen and progestogen containing, or 
progestogen -only), intrauterine contraception device or intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system (IUS) , or the male partner uses highly effective 
contraceptive method (defined above).  
†Note:  Abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual intercourse throughout the duration of 
study participation) is only acceptable as true abstinence,  i.e., when this is in line with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of a trial and withdrawal are not accepta ble methods of contraception.  
Note:  A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between 
the 2 can result in either or both products failing.  
Note:  Male patients with partners who are pregnant must use condoms to ensure that the fetus 
is not exposed to the Study Drug.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255897] will explain that the patient is in a clinical t rial 
and that serum lipase and/or amylase measures should be done in order to adjudicate the event 
based on Atlanta Classification (Banks et al. 2013 ).  If serum lipase and/or amylase activity is 
less than 3  × ULN, imaging,  preferably contrast -enhanced computed tomography, should be 
considered to confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis per the Atlanta Criteria.

Please refer to t he Study Drug Manual provided by [CONTACT_213327], administration  and patient observation post -Study Drug administration.  
8.2. Other Protocol -Required Drugs  
No other Study Drug treatments are required by [CONTACT_760].  
8.3. Other Protocol -Required Treatment Procedures  
No other treatment procedures are required by [CONTACT_760].  
8.4. Treatment Precautions  
No specific treatment precautions are required.  
8.5. Safety Monitoring Rules  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213269]  8.6. 
Please refer also to the ‘Guidance for Investigator’ section of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
• For the purposes of safety monitoring Baseline is defi ned as the average of the Day [ADDRESS_255900] measurement prior to Day 1.  
• In addition to the standard monitoring of clinical safety parameters, the following 
guidelines are provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on 
preclinical and clinical observations.  
• In case of discrepancy between the test results from [ADDRESS_255901] be initiated based on the more 
critical (lower or higher, as relevant) of the 2  values.  
Confirmation Guidance :  At any time during the study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Periods), 
the clinical laboratory results meeting any of the safety monitoring criteria presented below must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_10533] (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255902]  2023  
 
48  initial measurement) on new specimens.  All new specimen collections should take place as soon 
as possible (ideally within 3 days but no later than 7 days of the initial collection).  For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626], if the initial la boratory result is observed during the Treatment Period, the results from the 
retest must be available  prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug.  
Re-dosing Guidance :  In the event the initial laboratory result meets a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160], the 
resul ts from the retest must be available and reviewed by a Medical Monitor prior to 
administration of the next dose of Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo).  In general, patients 
who do not meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213270] d upon retest may continue dosing.  However, the 
Investigator and the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) should 
confer as to at which dose Study Drug should be restarted, and whether additional close 
monitoring of the patient is appropriate.  If any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37466] (refer to 
Section  8.6.1  through Section  8.6.3 ) are met, the patient will be permanently discontinued from 
further treatment with Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo), evaluated fully as outlined below 
and in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and 
will be followed up in accordance with Section  8.8 of the protocol.  
The Investigator may interrupt or permanently discontinue study treatment for any medical 
reason including changes in clinical laboratory results.  
8.5.1.  Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests  
The following rules are adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver 
Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, Food and Drug Administration, July  2009.  For a definition of B aseline, please refer to 
guidance in Section  8.[ADDRESS_255903] liver chemistry tests monitored every 14 days (±  2 days) for the first 
3 months of the Treatment Period, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period.  Upon 
completion of the study Treatment Period, liver chemistry tests should be monitored as per visit 
schedule in Appendix  A. 
In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs of hepatic injury (jaundice, fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, abnormal bleeding or bruising, or 
eosinophilia > ULN) liver enzymes and bilirubin should be tested as soon as possible (ideally 
within 3 days) .  Testing at a lab that is local to the patient is permissible for this purpose.  
In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3  × ULN (or the g reater of 2  × baseline 
value or 3  × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (Treatment or 
Post-Treatment Period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as described in 
Section  8.5. 
Frequency of Repeat Measurements:   Patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3  × ULN (or 
the greater of 2  × baseline value or 3  × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) should have their 
liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase  [ALP], INR and total bilirubin) retested at 
least once weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.2  × ULN or 1.2  × baseline if the 
baseline value was >  ULN.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255904]  2023  
 
49  Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations :  For patients with confirmed ALT or AST 
levels > 3  × ULN (or the greater of 2  × baseline val ue or 3  × ULN if the baseline value was 
> ULN), the following evaluations should be performed:  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases  
• Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including non -prescription 
medicati ons, herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational 
drug use, and special diets  
• Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel  
• Serology for viral hepatitis (HAV IgM, HBsAg, HCV antibody, cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) IgM, and EBV antibody panel)  
• Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ANA])  
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic CT or 
MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Inve stigator, in consultation with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor.  Repetition of the above evaluations should be considered if a 
patient’s ALT and/or AST levels reach ≥ 5  × ULN.  
The Study Drug must be interrupted until all evaluations and consultation with the S ponsor 
Medical Monitor is complete.  
Patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3  × ULN (or the greater of 2  × baseline value or 
3 × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) without an alternative explanation, and not meeting 
any of the Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213271] r chemistry elevations described in Section  8.6.[ADDRESS_255905] be promptly reviewed by [CONTACT_11856] 
(within 48 hours of receipt) and Medical Monitor(s) (within 24 hours of receipt) as described in 
Section  6.2.1 . 
Lab alerts for abnormal liver chemistry tests will be issued for:  1) ALT or AST > 3  × ULN; 
2) ALT or AST > 2  × baseline; 3) total bilirubin > ULN; 4) ALP > ULN.  These alert levels are 
set to anticipate the risk of a combined elevation of aminotransferases and bilirubin as per the 
FDA  Guidance referenced in Section  8.5.[ADDRESS_255906] renal function tests moni tored every 14 days (±  2 days) 
for the first 3 months of the Treatment Period, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment 
Period.  Upon completion of the study Treatment Period, renal function tests should be 
monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix  A. 
In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs consistent with renal dysfunction such as 
hematuria, polyuria, anuria, flank pain, new -onset hyperten sion, nausea and/or anorexia, renal

to the patient is permissible for this purpose.  
Renal function surveillance will include serum creatinine and urinaly sis including UACR, 
UPCR, urinary red blood cells (RBC).  The assessment of serum creatinine and urinalysis more 
frequently than every [ADDRESS_255908] be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by [CONTACT_213328][INVESTIGATOR_213272]  8.6.2 . 
If any of the below criteria are met, an alert will be issued and treatment with Study Drug should 
immediately be interrupted, and the Study Medical Monitor should b e informed.  In addition, the 
result should be confirmed as soon as possible (as described in Section  8.5), but no later than 
7 days after the initial  event.  
• eGFR (by [CONTACT_9289] -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_14420]) decrease from Baseline > 25%  
• Urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) >  300 mg/g, or  > 50% Baseline whichever is 
greater  
• UPCR > 500 mg/g, or  > 50% Baseline whichever is greater  
If the confirmatory test is negative (i.e., repeat sample taken with 7 days is within normal limits), 
the patient may continue treatment with Study Drug upon consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
If results from additional testing confirm the initial abnormal lab result, the site will obtai n any 
additional lab assessments necessary to determine any alternative etiologies that may account for 
the abnormal result,  upon consultation with the Medical Monitor.  
The Investigator should also review the patient’s concomitant medications for potential ly 
nephrotoxic agents, and, with the results of these evaluations, review any decision to continue or 
discontinue the patient in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  Any decision taken by [CONTACT_213329] o account all available and relevant 
data.  In addition, the decision to discontinue Study Drug may also be based on lesser changes in 
these parameters observed in isolation or in association with other renal -related abnormalities.

*** The suitability of the patient for reduced, interrupted and/or continued dosing will be determined b y the 
Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor and will be based on factors such as the original rate of 
decline in the patient’s PLT count, whether any bleeding events were experienced by [CONTACT_102], and the 
speed of recovery of PLT count af ter interruption of dosing.  
****  Recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by [CONTACT_24629] -dose glucocorticoids.  Treatment as 
recommended by [CONTACT_144378] (ASH) (Neunert et al. 2019 ) guidelines for immune 
thrombocytopenia (Blood Advances, 10 DECEMBER 2019, Volume 3, Number 23) includes initial therapy 
with either dexamethasone 40 mg per day for 4 days, or prednisone 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg per day.   Prednisolone or 
prednisone may be administ ered for up to 2 to 4 weeks with taper; alternatively, intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIG) may be administered at 0.4 g/kg/d for 5 days, or infusions of 1 g/kg/d for 1 -2 days (Provan et al. 2010 ; 
2019 ). 
 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255913]  2023  
 
52  Any case of a PLT count reduction to levels below  50,000/mm3 accompanied by a MB event or 
CRNMB event, or PLT count of < 25,000/mm3 independent of a MB or CRNMB event, is 
considered an AESI and should be reported following the same requirements  as for SAE 
reporting.  
Table  3: Additional Lab Analyses for Patients with Platelet Count Less Than 
50,000/mm3 
The following is a list of lab analyses for patients who have any occurrence of platelet count less 
than 50,000/mm3.  Archived samples prior to Day 1 of investigational treatment may also be 
analyzed in order to determine the patient’s baseline conditions.  
To Be Performed at Local Lab  
Peripheral smear (should be performed locally, fixed and sent to central lab for review)  
Fibrinogen split products or  D-dimer on fresh blood  
To Be Performed at Central Lab  
Citrated sample for platelets  
Coagulation panel (PT/INR, aPTT)  
CBC with reticulocytes and mean platelet volume  
Total globulins: IgG and IgM  
Complement:   total C3, total C4, C5a  
Serology for:  
HBV, HCV, HIV (if not done recently for screening)  
To Be Performed at Specialty Lab(s)  
Antiplatelet antibodies  
Anti-ASO antibody  
Note:  These labs may be performed in the event of a platelet count less than 75,000/mm3 after discussion with the 
Study Medical Monitor.  Additional lab tests may be considered in order to ascertain potential causative conditions 
for significant platelet count decreases / thrombocytopenia.  
 
8.5.4.  Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events  
Patients will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study 
Drug treatment (Day 1) up to the end of the Follow -up Period.  All bleeding events are 
considered AEs and reported on the AE case report form.  
If an e vent a MB or CRNMB event occurs ( as defined below) , the Investigator must notify the 
Medical Monitor (or designee) and the patient should be treated, as needed, immediately and 
closely monitored (vital signs, lab tests such as hemoglobin ( Hb), hematocrit ( HCT), and 
PLT count, additional visits, overnight stays and coagulation tests may be needed  if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_1963] ) throughout the Treatment and Post -Treatment Evaluation 
Periods and an (S)AE case report form will be completed.  In  addition, approximately [ADDRESS_255914] be stored allowing 
for a centralized assessment of ISIS  678354 concentrations.  
If a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator should notify the Med ical Monitor (or 
designee) and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, PT, INR), PLT count, and 
PLT volume may be performed.  
Major bleeding is defined as 1 of the following (Schulman and Kearon 2005 ): 
1. Fatal bleeding  
2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular if in a major joint, or pericardial, or 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome  
3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed RBCs or whole 
blood or a fall in Hb of 2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24 hours  
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding  is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for 
MB but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had clinical 
consequences for a patient (Schulman and Kearon 2005 ). 
1. Multiple -source bleeding  
2. Spontaneous hematoma > 25 cm2 
3. Excessive wound hematoma (not injection site related)  
4. Macrosc opic hematuria (spontaneous or lasting >  24 hours if associated with an 
intervention)  
5. Spontaneous rectal bleeding; epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], gingival bleeding, hemoptysis, hematemesis  
6. Bleeding after venipuncture for > 5 minutes  
Minor bleeding  events are those that do not  fulfill the criteria for MB or clinically relevant, 
non-major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival 
bleeding on brushing teeth.  
8.5.5.  Safety Monitoring for Constitutional Symptoms  
Patients will be instructed to prompt ly report any signs or symptoms of fever, constitutional 
symptoms, rash, arthralgia or joint swelling that may arise during the study and the Investigator 
should closely evaluate all potential causes, including concomitant illness.  Patients who 
experience  persistent or increasing symptoms should be tested for ADA and discussed with the 
Medical Monitor or designee to determine whether additional monitoring or laboratory tests are 
required.  
8.5.6.  Safety Monitoring for Potential Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Patients will be instructed to promptly report any signs or symptoms of potential hypersensitivity 
reactions  that include the acute onset of the following: urticarial rash, pruritus, flushing, 
angioedema dyspnea, and/or acute onset hypotension, that may arise durin g the study.   The 
Investigator should closely evaluate all potential causes, including concomitant illnesses.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255915]  2023  
 
54  Patients who experience symptoms of a potential hypersensitivity reaction should be tested  
within 15 minutes to 3 hours after onset of symptoms, or as soon as possible thereafter for:  
• Tryptase  
• High -sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP)  
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)  
• Complement factors (C3, C4, C5a, and Bb)  
• Immunoglobulin E (IgE)  
• CBC with differential  
• Serum chemistry  
• Urinalysis  
• UPCR  
• Anti-drug antibody (ADA)  
• Antinuclear antibody (ANA)  
• Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)  
If a hypersensitivity reaction is established, Study Drug discontinuation should  be recommended.   
The patient’s symptoms should be managed per standard of care . 
8.5.7.  Safety Monitoring for LDL -C Elevations  
Beginning at Week 27, laboratory alerts will be in place to notify the Investigator if a patient has 
an LDL -C > 130 mg/dL (> 100 mg/dL for patients with T2DM  or CAD with Baseline 
LDL -C > 100 mg/dL ) on 2 consecutive visits.   If this occurs, LDL -C values for this patient will 
be unblinded for the remainder of the study and the Investigator will be encouraged to 
initiate/adjust treatment to lower LDL -C according to country -specific guidelines (e.g., initiate 
statin therapy or in crease the statin dose for patients who are already on treatme nt). 
8.6. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213274]  8.5. 
For the purposes of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], Baseline is defined as the average of the Day [ADDRESS_255916]  2023  
 
55  ≤ 3 × ULN .  Until this evaluation is completed and a decision agreed upon, the treatment 
with the Study Drug will remain interrup ted. 
In the event of confirmed laboratory results meeting any of the foll owing criteria,  and the event 
is without an alternative explanation as discussed with the Medical Monitor, dosing of a 
patient with Study Drug (ISIS 678354 or placebo) will be stopped permanently; values that are 
not confirmed due to failure to retest or m issing lab values will be presumed confirmed:  
1. ALT or AST > 8  × ULN, which is confirmed  
2. ALT or AST > 5  × ULN, which is confirmed and persists for ≥ [ADDRESS_255917] > 3  × ULN (or the greater of 2  × baseline value or 3  × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN), which is confirmed and total bilirubin > 2  × ULN or INR > 1.[ADDRESS_255918] > 3  × ULN (or the greater of 2  × baseline value or 3  × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN) , which is confirmed, and the new appearance (i.e., onset coincides 
with the changes in hepatic enzymes) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or concomitant eosinophilia (> ULN)  
8.6.2.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213275]  8.5.2  are met, 
treatment with Study Drug should immediately be interrupted and the abnormal result should be 
confirmed as soon as possible, but no later than 7 days after the initial event.  In addition, upon 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, the site will obtain any additional lab asse ssments 
necessary to determine any alternative etiologies that may account for the abnormal result.  If 
results from additional testing confirm the initial abnormal lab result(s) described in 
Section  8.5.2 , and additional evaluations regarding etiology accounting for these abnormalities 
are completed, future treatment of the patient will be determined per the guidelines below:  
• An alternative etiology is  identified that may account for abnormal results  
o Patient will have treatment with Study Drug interrupted until either:  
▪ Lab values have returned to baseline, and/or  
▪ Alternative etiology has resolved/recovered, AND  
▪ Study Medical Monitor has approved Study D rug treatment to resume  
• An alternative etiology has not been identified that may account for abnormal results:  
o Patient will be permanently withdrawn from Study Drug treatment  
The follow -up schedule and frequency of renal function monitoring after the initi al event will be 
determined by [CONTACT_213331].  The Investigator 
should consider consulting a local nephrologist for any change of renal function that presents a 
concern.  If a renal biopsy is performed, a sample specimen should be made available for 
examination by [CONTACT_213332].

dosing by [CONTACT_183177] (or designee).  
8.7. Adjustment of Dose and/or Treatment Schedule  
Dose adjustments for platelet count reduction must be made in accordance with Table  2 (above).  
Other adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose will be allowed for 
safety or tolerability after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
Dose adjustments should not occur unless absolutely necessary prior to the primary analysis time 
point (Month 6).  
8.8. Discontinuation of Study D rug 
A patient must permanently discontinue Study Drug treatment for any of the following:  
• The patient becomes pregnant.  Report the pregnancy according to instructions in  
Section  9.5.4  
• The patient withdraws consent  
• The patient experiences an AE that necessitates permanent discontinuation of Study 
Drug  
• The patient develops laboratory test abnormalities that meet any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_213279] 8.6.1  to Section  8.6.3  
• The patient exp eriences an AE that necessitates unblinding of the Investigator or 
Sponsor to the patient’s treatment assignment  
The reason for discontinuation of Study Drug must be recorded in the eCRF and source 
documentation.  
8.8.1.  Follow -up Visits for Early Termination from  Treatment Period or 
Post-Treatment Follow -up Period  
Any patient who discontinues early from the Treatment Period should be strongly encouraged to 
attend applicable landmark visits at Weeks 23, 25, 27 and Weeks 51 and 53 (calculated based on 
the time elaps ed since Day 1) to collect fasting lipid panels and conduct safety  assessments in 
accordance with Appendix  A.  Any patient who discontinues early from the Post -Treatment 
Follow -up Period should be strongly encouraged to complete follow -up study visits, procedures 
and observations in accordance with Appendix  A. 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255920]-End of Treatment Period (as per visit schedule).  
If a patient discontinues early from the Treatment Period and declines or is unable to participate 
in the above, an ET visit (Week 53 visit assessments) should be performed at the time o f 
withdrawal, and ideally within [ADDRESS_255921] -Treatment Follow -up Period and declines or is 
unable to participate in the above, a final visit (assessments from Week [ADDRESS_255922] -Treatment 
Follow -up Period) should be performed at the time of withdrawal.  
8.9. Withdrawal of Patients from the Study Procedures  
Patients must be withdrawn from study procedures for any of the following:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• The patient is unwil ling or unable to comply with the protocol  
• The patient meets any of the Exclusion Criteria (see Section  5.2) after enrolling in the 
study that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_213280] a safety risk to the patient  
Other reasons for withdrawal of patients from study procedures might include:  
• At the discretion of the Investigator for medical reasons  
• At the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for  noncompliance  
• Significant protocol deviation  
All efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to 
the date of withdrawal.  All information, including the reason for withdrawal from study, must be 
recorded in the  eCRF.  
Any patient who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from further 
treatment and study observation immediately upon the date of request.  These patients should be 
encouraged to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of 
withdrawal Appendix  A. 
For patients withdrawn for reasons other than withdrawal of consent every effort should be made 
to complete the early termination of study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal 
(see Appendix  A) and ideally within [ADDRESS_255923] be recorded on the patient’s 
eCRF.  Adverse events related to administration of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_10459].

58  8.10.1.  Concomitant Therapy  
A concomitant therapy is any non -protocol specified drug or substance (including OTC 
medications, herbal medicat ions and vitamin supplements) administered from the time the 
patient has signed the informed consent at Screening to the end of the Post -Treatment Follow -up 
Period.  
Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
Any medications deemed necessary by [CONTACT_213333] d except those listed in the 
disallowed concomitant therapy.  
Disallowed Concomitant Therapy  
No GLP -[ADDRESS_255925] udy.  This includes marketed agents at 
experimental dosages that are being tested for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.  
Patients should consult with the Investigator or designee prior to initiating any new medication, 
including non -prescription or her bal compounds or any other non -drug therapy.  
8.10.2.  Concomitant Procedures  
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed betwee n 
Screening and the end of the Post -Treatment Follow -up Period.  
Disallowed Concomitant Procedures  
Plasma apheresis is not allowed during the study.  
8.11. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded in the eCRF by [CONTACT_26769] C enter 
staff.  
Patients or Study Center Staff will record treatment in a dosing diary that will be reviewed 
periodically by [CONTACT_213334].  
9. SERIOUS AND NON -SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING  
9.1. Sponsor Review of Safety Information  
Safety information will be collected, reviewed, and evaluated by [CONTACT_144387]/or designee SOPs throughout the conduct of the clinical 
trial. 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255926]  2023  
 
59  9.2. Regulatory Requirements  
The Sponsor  or designee  is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the 
Investigators of serious adverse events (SAEs) including S[LOCATION_003]Rs per the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines E2A and ICH GCP.  Country -specific regulatory 
requirements will be followed in accordance with local country regulations and guidelines.  
Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees will be notified of any SAE 
according to applicable regulations.  The DSMB will be notified of any SAE as spec ified in the 
DSMB charter.  
In addition to the Investigator’s assessment of relatedness, the  Sponsor  or designee  will evaluate 
the available information and perform an independent assessment of all reported SAEs and 
determine if there is a reasonable possib ility that the Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) is 
causally related to a reported SAE.  
The Sponsor  or designee  will evaluate the available information for all reported SAEs and decide 
if there is a reasonable  possibility that the Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) caused the SAE 
and, therefore, meets the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
Appropriate personnel at the Sponsor  or designee  will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting.  T he Sponsor or designee  will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Regulatory Agencies in 
blinded or unblinded fashion according to local law.  The Sponsor  or designee  will submit 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Investigators in a blinded fashion.  
The following table identifi es the SAEs that the Sponsor or designee  will not report on an 
individual basis in an expedited manner because they are anticipated to occur in the study 
population independent of the Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) exposure.  The Investigator 
still has the responsibility to report all SAEs to the Sponsor as described in Section  9.4.1  to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .

(investigational) product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
An AE can therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory f inding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
Baseline  
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from Study Drug  
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive procedures 
such as biopsi es) 
9.3.2.  Adverse Drug Reaction and Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
In the pre-approval  clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not have been establish ed, ADR is defined as follows:  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should 
be considered ADRs.  
The phrase "responses to a medicinal product" means that a causal relationship between the 
medicinal product and the A E has been determined by [CONTACT_10548] a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255928] information, e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse 
reaction.  
9.3.3.  Serious Adverse Event  
A ser ious AE is any AE that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening:  that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient  at immediate risk 
of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected AE that , had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused dea th 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in  the offspring of the patient (whether 
the patient is male or female)  
• Important medical events  that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10462], based upon 
appropriate medical jud gment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency r oom or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse, or spontaneous abortion/miscarriage.  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to  the intensity of an AE 
(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; OR Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preve ntive Vaccine Clinical Trials; the event itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further 
findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF.  
9.3.4.  Adverse Event of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest ( AESI), including both serious or non -serious  events,  is one 
of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for  which 
ongoing monitoring and rapid communication  by [CONTACT_213337] . 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255929] are required to be reported by [CONTACT_213338] ( Section  9.4.1 ). 
For the purpose of this study there are 2 AESIs:  
1. Severe reductions in platelet count < 50,000/mm3 accompanied by a MB event or 
CRNMB event, or platelet count of < 25,000/mm3 indepen dent of a MB or CRNMB 
event  
2. Requirement of any use of medications (such as antihistamines, acetaminophen, 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], corticosteroids, etc.) as pre -treatment 
to avoid a hypersensitivity reaction or recurrence of a previo us hypersensitivity reaction.  
9.4. Monitoring and Recording Adverse Events  
Any pre -existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as 
AEs unless the pre -existing condition worsened.  The Investigator should always group signs and 
symptoms into a single term that constitutes a  single unifying diagnosis  if possible.  Before a 
diagnosis is confirmed, all symptoms should be repor ted as separate AEs.  
9.4.1.  Serious Adverse Events  
In the interest of patient safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs and 
AESIs (regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor  or 
designee within 24 hour s of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event.  The collection of 
SAEs will begin after the patient signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the 
patient’s Follow -up Period.  SAEs should be captured and reported electronically within 
Electronic Data Capture System (EDC).  The SAE reporting instruction, including the fax 
number and email address can be found in the Investigator site file for the study.  
Detailed information should be actively sought and included on electronic Follow -Up Ser ious 
Adverse Event Forms in EDC as soon as additional information becomes available.  All SAEs 
will be followed until resolution.  SAEs that remain ongoing past the patient’s last 
protocol -specified follow -up visit will be evaluated by [CONTACT_213339].  If the 
Investigator and Sponsor agree the patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator and 
Sponsor will determine the follow -up requirement.  
9.4.2.  Non-Serious Adverse Events  
The recording of non -serious AEs will begin after the patient  signs the informed consent form 
and will stop at the end of the patient’s Follow -up Period .  The Investigator will monitor each 
patient closely and record all observed or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report 
Form.  
9.4.3.  Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious)  
The Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_10463] . 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255930]  2023  
 
63  [IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to the Study Drug  
The event’s relationship to the Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) is characterized by [CONTACT_144393]:  
• Related:   There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug, 
e.g., confirmation by [CONTACT_38000] -challenge test  
• Possible:   The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medic al condition, 
concomitant therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship 
between the event and Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) administration  
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an a lternative explanation is more likely 
(e.g.,  concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal 
relationship to Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) administration and/or exposure 
suggests that a causal relationship  is unlikely (for reporting purposes, 
Unlikely/Remote will be grouped together with Not Related)  
• Not Related:   The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_8130]’s underlying medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator 
believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity  
The severity of AEs and SAEs relating to laboratory tests will be graded based on criteria from 
the CTCAE Version 5.0, November 2017  (refer to Appendix  D).  Any AE not listed in 
Appendix  D will be graded as follows:  
• Mild:   The event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_10553]’s 
usual daily activities  
• Moderate:   The event causes the patient more discomfort and interrupts the patient’s 
usual daily activities  
• Severe:   The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with the 
patient’s usual daily activities  
The severity of AEs and SAEs relating to AEs at the injection site will be graded based on 
criteria from the Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled 
in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, Sept 2007 (refer to Appendix  D).   
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria  must be indicated (criteria listed in 
Section  9.3.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Action Taken  with Study Drug  
Action taken with Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) due to the event is characterized by [CONTACT_144394].  
• None:  No changes were made to Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) 
administration and dose  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255931]  2023  
 
64  • Not Applicable:   SAE/AE was reported during Screening Period prior to Study Drug 
administration  
• Permanently Discontinued:   Study Drug was discontinued and not restarted  
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted:   Dosing was temporarily interrupted or 
delayed due to the AE and restarted  
• Reduced Dose:   Dosing was reduced to a lower dose  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Given for Adverse Event  
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for the AE should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event Case Report Form.  T reatment should also be recorded on the concomitant 
treatment or ancillary procedures eCRF , as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Outcome of the Adverse Event  
If the event is a non -serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of t he following:  
• AE Persists:   Patient terminates from the trial and the AE continues  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the AE  
• Became Serious:   The event became serious (the date that the event became serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution D ate of that AE and the Onset Date of the 
corresponding SAE)  
• Change in Severity (if applicable):   AE severity changed  
If the event is an SAE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following:  
• Ongoing:   SAE continuing  
• Persists (as non -serious AE):   Patient has not fully recovered but the event no longer 
meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious AE  eCRF 
(the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered comple tely from the SAE (the date of recovery should 
be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Recovered with Sequelae:   The signs/symptoms of the reported SAE have improved 
but not completely resolved, and a new baseline for the patient is established since 
full r ecovery is not expected  
• Fatal:   Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Unknown:   The outcome of the reported SAE is not available, e.g., patient is lost to 
follow -up 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -Up of Adverse Event  
Investigator Follow -Up 
During the Study Period, the Investigator should follow each AE until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the 
ISIS [ADDRESS_255932]  2023  
 
65  patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to fo llow all SAEs considered to be 
related to Study Drug or related to study procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
Resolution of AE (with dates) should be documented on the AE eCRF and in the patient’s 
medical record to facilitate source data verif ication.  
Investigator should follow -up, or support the Sponsor’s effort to follow up with all pregnancies 
reported during the study from either the study patient or the female partner of male study patient 
until pregnancy outcome is available.  
Sponsor Follow -Up 
For SAEs, AESI and pregnancy cases in patients who have completed or terminated the study, 
the Sponsor or a designee should follow -up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit 
(on-site or remote access) to obtain additional case details  and outcome information (e.g., from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an 
independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adjudication Committees  
All AEs and SAEs that occur during the study that ar e consistent with a major adverse 
cardiovascular event (MACE) will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee as 
outlined in the MACE Adjudication Charter.  
All AEs and SAEs that occur during the study that are consistent with an event of acute 
panc reatitis will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee according to the Atlanta 
classification of acute pancreatitis (Banks et al. 2013 ) and as outlined in the Pancreatitis 
Adjudication Charter.  In addition, data  for epi[INVESTIGATOR_213281] 5 years prior to enrollment will be collected by [CONTACT_81804]’s 
medical chart and these events will also be adjudicated.  
9.5. Procedures for Handling Special Situations  
9.5.1.  Abnormalities  of Laboratory Tests  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results 
that are associated with symptoms, or requi re treatment, e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, 
tetany due to hypocalcemia, or cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever possible, the 
underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs.  
Clinically sign ificant abnormalities will be monitored by [CONTACT_84259].  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically significant (N CS) by [CONTACT_10555].  Similarly, laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs 
by [CONTACT_10556].  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory repo rts.  The signed 
clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents and should include the Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255933]  2023  
 
66  9.5.2.  Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Tre atments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; the Study Center must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely sch eduled treatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s 
consent to participate in the study  
• The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely 
scheduled treatment was present b efore and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_10464]’s consent to participate in the study and the 
timing of the procedure or treatment  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the so le 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
9.5.3.  Dosing Errors  
Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) errors (including overdose, underdose, and administration 
error) should be documented as Protocol Deviations.  A brief description should be provided in 
the deviation, including whether the patient  was symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomat ic, 
and the event accidental or intentional.  
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing Case Report Form.  If the patient takes a dose 
of Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) that exceeds protocol specificat ions and the patient is 
symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per 
Section  9.4. 
An overdose is the accidenta l or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose 
being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an AE, but 
it may result in an AE.  All AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of  Study 
Drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated AE fulfills seriousness 
criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours 
after learning of the event).  
Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should contact [CONTACT_213340] [ADDRESS_255934] learning of the occurrence of pregnancy.  Follow -up 
information including delivery or termination is reported by [CONTACT_10558] ‘Follow -up’ on the 
Pregnancy Forms and reported within [ADDRESS_255935]  2023  
 
67  Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the  patient’s 
responsibility.  
Female patients :  If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including during the 
Follow -up Period), a pregnancy test will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed pregnancy 
will be immediately withdrawn from treatmen t with Study Drug.  However, the patient will be 
encouraged to complete the post -treatment follow -up portion of the study to the extent that study 
procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued study participation, the 
Investigato r will assist the patient in getting obstetrical care and the progress of the pregnancy 
will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, 
or spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and 
Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical records to obtain additional 
information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A longer follow -up may be 
required if the newborn child experiences a medi cal condition.  Follow -up will be performed to 
the extent permitted by [CONTACT_10559] ; e.g., pregnancy 
ICF may be required . 
Male patients :  The progress of the pregnancy of a male patient’s partner should be followed 
until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may 
follow -up with the mother and may request access to the mother and infant’s medical records to 
obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.   A longer 
follow -up may be required if the newborn child experiences a medical condition.  Follow -up will 
be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_10559]; 
e.g., partner ICF may be required .  
Spontaneous abortion/miscarriage is to be reported as an SAE.  See Section  9.4.1  for additional 
information regarding SAE reporting.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1. Stratification, Subsets, and Covariates  
The stratification factors include:  
• Prior history of pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening (Yes vs. No)  
• Previous treatment with volanesorsen (Yes vs. No)  
Subgroup analysis for primary endpoint will include, but not limited to, prior history of 
pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening (Yes vs. No), previous treatment with 
volanesorsen (Yes vs. No), reg ion (North America, Europe, and ROW) , etc., if supported by 
[CONTACT_33653].  Details of the subgroup analyses will be provided in the SAP.  
In general, the covariate will include stratification factors and baseline measurements (where 
applicable), the details will be  provided in Section  10.6.[ADDRESS_255936]  2023  
 
68  10.2. Sample Size Considerations  
Based upon prior clinical trial experience with FCS patients, the SD of the percent change fro m 
Baseline in TGs is approximately 46%.  With 14 patients in each ISIS 678354 treatment group 
and 14 in the pooled placebo group, there would be a 90% power to detect a 60% difference 
between each ISIS 678354 treatment group and pooled placebo group at an alpha level of 0.05 
(two-sided), assuming 60% reduction in the ISIS 678354 treatment patients and no change in the 
placebo patients.  Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in this trial to account for potential 
early dropouts and to facilitate some ge neral safety evaluations.  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to Cohort A or Cohort B and each cohort further 
randomized  2:1 (ISIS  678354:placebo) and stratified for:  
• Prior history of pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening * vs. no history of 
pancreatitis or no history within 10 years prior to Screening  
• Previous treatment with volanesorsen  
* History of pancreatitis is defined as a recorded diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213282] a cute pancreatitis and for which no 
alternate diagnosis was made  
10.3. Analysis Populations  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) :  All patients who are randomized and received any dose of Study Drug 
(ISIS 678354 or placebo).   The FAS represents the practically  feasible intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population as delineated in ICH Guideline E9.  This population will be used for the primary 
analysis of efficacy . 
Per Protocol Set (PPS) :  Subset of the FAS who received at least [ADDRESS_255937] no major protocol violations 
that could compromise the interpretation of efficacy.  Major violations will be determined prior 
to unblinding for statistical analysis.  This population will be used for supportive inferences 
concerning efficacy.  
Safety Set :  All patients who are randomized and receive any dose of Study Drug.  This 
population will be used for all safety analyses.  
PK Population :  All patients who are randomized and receive at least [ADDRESS_255938] pooled placebo 
using the hierarchical testing procedure, in which the ISIS  678354 80 mg treatment group will be 
compared to the pooled placebo at the alpha level of 0.05, if the comparison is statistically 
significant (p  < 0.05), the n the ISIS  [ADDRESS_255939] pooled placebo and all secondary endpoints will be considered exploratory.  
Testing of secondary endpoint family will be performed only if the comparison of the primary 
endpoint is statistically significant (p  < 0.05) for both ISIS  678354 80 -mg and 50 -mg treatment 
groups.  Testing of the secondary endpoint family will be conducted according to the following 
sequence:

TG ≤ 500 mg/dL at the primary analysis time point between ISIS  [ADDRESS_255942] secondary endpoint is statistically significant (p < 0.05), then the 
second secondary endpoint will be tested.  However, if the comparison of the first secondary 
endpoint is not statistically significant, then all endpoints of lower rank will be considered 
exploratory.  This process is repeated with each subsequent secondary endpoint.  
10.6. Planned Methods of Analysis  
All eCRF dat a, lab data transfers, and any outcomes derived from the data will be provided in the 
patient listings.  Patient data listings will be presented for all patients enrolled into the study.   
Descriptive summary statistics including n, mean, median, SD, standa rd error, interquartile range 
(25th percentile, 75th percentile), and range (minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, and 
counts and percentages for categorical variables will be used to summarize most data.  Where 
appropriate, p -values will be reported .  All statistical tests will be conducted using 2 -sided tests 
with 5% Type I error rate unless otherwise stated.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255943]  2023  
 
72  The primary endpoint will be assessed on the FAS and PPS, with the former being the basis for 
the primary efficacy analysis.  The secondary en dpoints will be assessed in the FAS.  All safety 
assessments will be performed on the Safety Set.  
10.6.1.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and Baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics by 
[CONTACT_1570].  The patient disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  All patients 
enrolled will be included in a summary of patient disposition.  
10.6.2.  Safety Analysis  
Treatment duration and amount of Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) received will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Patient incidence rates of all AEs will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_11189], and by [CONTACT_78745].  Tables and/or narratives of treatment 
emergent deaths, serious and significant AEs, including e arly withdrawals due to AEs, will also 
be provided.  
All treatment -emergent AEs, all treatment -emergent AEs potentially related to Study Drug, all 
treatment -emergent serious AEs, and all treatment -emergent serious AEs potentially related to 
Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) will be summarized.  
Laboratory tests to ensure patient safety including chemistry panel, complete blood count with 
differential, coagulation panel, etc., will be summarized by [CONTACT_213341].  
These safety variables will also be presented as change and percent change from Baseline over 
time after Study Drug ( ISIS 678354  or placebo) administration, as appropriate.  In addition, the  
number of patients who experience abnormalities in clinical laboratory evaluations will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Vital sign and ECG measures will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  
10.6.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary analysis  of the primary endpoint is to compare the percent change from Baseline to 
the primary analysis time point in fasting TG between each ISIS  [ADDRESS_255944] s of treatment (ISIS  678354 80 mg, ISIS  678354 50 mg, or Placebo), 2 randomization 
stratification factors (history of pancreatitis and previous treatment with volanesorsen), and 
log-transformed baseline TG.  To account for potential heterogeneity in varian ce, the 95% CI of 
the treatment differences will be calculated using the robust variance estimator based  on the Bell 
and McCaffrey method  (Imbens and Kolesár 2016 ).  If patients have intercurrent event(s) before 
Week 23, e.g., treatment discontinuation, use of additional medication, changes in background or 
concomitant treatments, the Treatment Policy strategy will be implemented, the patients’ 
assessments post intercu rrent events will continue to be collected and utilized in the primary 
analysis.  Patients with a missing TG value after discontinuation will have TG value multiply 
imputed at Primary analysis time point based on the known assessments from the retrieved 
dropouts (i.e., patients who discontinue before Week [ADDRESS_255945]  2023  
 
73  Week  23, 25 or 27), if there is a sufficient number of retrieved dropouts.  The imputation model 
will include the following variables:  TG values at baseline and post -baseline visits and the 
2 randomization stratification factors.  The multiple imputation will be stratified by [CONTACT_6490].  If there is not a sufficient number of retrieved dropouts, missing TG value at the primary 
time point will be imputed using a “wa sh-out” (Jump to Reference, J2R) multiple imputation 
approach.  With the approach, patients treated with ISIS  [ADDRESS_255946] patient has completed the Week 53/ET 
visit and the database has been locked, and will be based on the percent change from Baseline in 
fasting TG at primary analysis time point (end of Month 6).  Details of the controlled access to 
the unblinde d data will be outlined in the SAP and Unblinding Plan.  
During the database lock cleaning process, redacted source documentation may need to be shared 
securely with the site Clinical Research Associate (CRA) for source data verification procedures  
The foll owing sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be conducted to assess the 
robustness of the primary analysis result, and details of the analyses will be outlined in the  SAP:  
• The primary analysis described above will be repeated in the PPS.  
• The pri mary analysis will be repeated in the subset of FAS with no missing TG value 
at the baseline and primary analysis time point.  
• Additional sensitivity analyses using controlled  imputations (pattern mixture models) 
with ANCOVA will be conducted in the FAS to assess the robustness of the primary 
analysis results.  
o For patients treated with ISIS 678354 who discontinue the study due to AE or 
lack of efficacy (i.e., informative missin g), their missing TG data after treatment 
discontinuation will be multiply imputed using the copy increment from reference 
(CIR) approach based on the estimates from of the placebo patients.  The CIR 
approach is detailed in (Carpenter et al. 2013 ).  The assumption is when a patient 
discontinues treatment due to informative missing, from withdrawal onwards 
he/she would progress in the same way as the patients in the placebo group.  For 
patients who discontinue due to other r easons and all patients from the placebo 
group, their missing data will be treated as non -informative missing, and data will 
be multiply imputed based on the distribution of their own arm.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_255947] 
approach based on the estimates from the placebo patients. Missing TG for 
placebo patients will be imputed based on the distribution of the placebo group . 
• A nonparametri c Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be performed  on the percent change in 
fasting TG from baseline to the primary analysis time  point in the FAS .  Missing data 
will be handled using the same multiple imputation method as the primary analysis . 
• An additional sensitivity analysis using the two-dimensional  tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -point approach 
will be conducted in the FAS to assess the  impact of missing data on the result of the 
primary analysis.   A range of penalties will be added to the imputed values for each 
group until the result becomes non -significant and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_213283].  
• An ANCOVA model will be performed in the FAS using the nature log transformed 
data. Missing data will be handled using the same multiple imputation method as the 
primary anal ysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
• The percent change in fasting TG from Baseline to Month [ADDRESS_255948] as the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.  
• The proportion of patients who achieve ≥  40% reduction in fasting TG from Baseline 
to the primary analysis time point in the FAS  will be compared between each 
ISIS 678354 treatment group and placebo group using a logistic regression model 
with the treatment group, history of pancreatitis (yes/no), previous treatment with  
volanesorsen (yes/no) as the factors, and log -transformed baseline TG as a covariate.  
Missing TG values will be imputed using the same multiple imputation method as the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint.  A sensitivity analysis will be conducted i n 
the FAS, in which all patients who have missing data and discontinue treatment 
before Week  23 will be considered as non -responders.

with ≥ 2 events of adjudicated acute pancreatitis in 5 years prior to enroll ment  
− From Week 13 to Week 53 in the subset of FAS with ≥ 2 events of adjudicated 
acute pancreatitis in 5 years prior to enrollment  
will be compared between pooled ISIS  678354 treatment group and placebo group 
using a Poisson regression model or Negative Bi nomial regression model with the 
treatment group, history of pancreatitis (yes/no), previous treatment with 
volanesorsen (yes/no) as the factors, and number of adjudicated acute pancreatitis 
events in 5 years prior to the enrollment as a covariate.  The lo garithm of time in year 
that each patient observed during the corresponding analysis period (Week 13 to 
Week 53 or Week 1 to Week 53/ET) will be used as an offset variable.  
• The proportion of patients who achieve ≥  70% reduction in fasting TG from Baseline 
to the primary analysis time point in the FAS will be analyzed in the same way as the 
proportion of patients who achieve ≥ 40% reduction in fasting TG.  Missing values 
will be imputed using the same multiple imputation method as the primary analysis of 
the primary endpoint.  A sensitivity analysis will be conducted in the FAS, in which 
all patients who have missing data and discontinue treatment before Week 23 will be 
considered as non -responders.  
• The proportion of patients who achieve fasting TG ≤ 500 mg/d L at the primary 
analysis time point will be analyzed in the same way as the proportion of patients 
who achieve ≥ 40% reduction in fasting TG.  Missing values will be imputed using 
the same multiple imputation method as the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.  
It will be conducted in the subset of FAS  with baseline TG > 500 mg/dL.  
A sensitivity analysis will be conducted in the subset of FAS with baseline

4.5 Analysis Sets  Definition of PPS updated:  
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  Subset of the FAS who received at least [ADDRESS_255999] 6 months (172 days) of the Treatment 
Period, have a baseline TG assessment  and who have no significant protocol 
violations that could compromise  the interpretation of efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling of Dropouts or 
Missing Data  Section updated:  
If there is no sufficient number of retrieved dropouts, missing TG value at 
the primary analysis time point will be imputed using a “wash -out” multiple 
imputation approach (Jump to Reference, J2R). With the approach, patients 
treated with ISIS [ADDRESS_256000] -baseline visits and the 2 stratification factors from 
the placebo group.  
The “wash -out” multiple imputation will be preformed in the following 
steps:  
1. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used 
under the multivariate normality assumption to impute the all 
missing values by [CONTACT_1570]. The variable list for 
imputations will include the baseline value, as well as all available 
post-baseline value, and stratification factors. To conform to the 
multivariate normality assumption, baseline, and post -baseline 
fasting lipid data will be natural log -transformed before the 
imputation process, and the variable values will be back 
transformed to create the imputed data set. The SAS procedure 
PROC MI will be used in the multiple imputation. The MCMC 
method w ill impute primary analysis time point data  one dataset  
forrom each of the [ADDRESS_256001] imputation 
stage. EM algorithm will be used to derive a set of initial parameter 
estimates for MCMC method. A non -informative prior (Jeffreys’ 
prior) will be used to derive the posterior distribution of the 
parameters. A total of  100 imputed datasets will be created from 
the above 2 -stage multiple imputation process……  
2. A general linear model will be fitted using the data in the 
placebo group for each  imputed dataset  
3. For patients in both ISIS [ADDRESS_256002] dose date will be  replaced with the values 
imputed using J2R method (calculated using the patients’ own 
baseline fasting TG, the 2 stratification factors, and the  model 
from step 2)  
4. The variable values will be back transformed from nature log 
scale to the original scale in the final imputed datasets.

4.9.2.   Primary Efficacy Variable  Section updated:  
1) Patients with missing TG value at the primary analysis time point 
will be imputed using a pattern mixture model. Specifically, for 
patients treated with ISIS 678354 who discontinue the study  
treatment  due to AE or lack of efficacy (i.e., informative missin g), 
their missing fasting TG data after treatment discontinuation  the last 
dosing date  will be multiply imputed using the copy increment from 
reference (CIR) approach based on the estimates from of the placebo 
patients. The CIR approach is detailed in (Carpenter et al.  2013 ). 
The assumption is when a patient discontinues treatment due to 
informative missing, from withdrawal onwards he/she would 
progress in the same way as the patients in the placebo group. For 
patients who d iscontinue due to other reasons and all patients from 
the placebo group, their missing data will be treated as 
non-informative missing, and data will be multiply imputed based 
on the distribution of their own treatment group.  
2) All patients treated with ISIS [ADDRESS_256009] approach based on the 
estimates from the placebo patients. Missing TG values for placebo 
patients will be imp uted based on the distribution of the placebo 
group.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Eligible patients will 
enter an approximately [ADDRESS_256026] 
2-week Diet Stabilization/Run -In Period for patients not already on a stable diet, and an 
approximately 2 -week Qualification Period. Following qualification, approxim ately 60 eligible 
patients will be randomized 1:1 to Cohort A (50 mg) or Cohort B (80 mg) and each cohort further 
randomized 2:1 to receive ISIS 678354 or placebo  in a 53 -week Treatment Period. Patients in Cohort 
A will receive 50 mg of ISIS 678354 once ev ery 4 weeks or matching volume of placebo (0.5 mL) 
Weeks 1 -49, of the Treatment Period. Patients in Cohort B will receive 80 mg ISIS 678354 once 
every 4 weeks or matching volume of placebo (0.8 mL) Weeks 1 -49 of the Treatment Period. 
Randomization will be stratified by (1) prior history of pancreatitis (within 10 years prior to 
Screening) and (2) previous treatment with volanesorsen. Dietary counseling will commence at the 
start of the Diet Stabilization Period and will be reinforced at intervals throughout  the Treatment and 
Follow -up Period. Following the Week [ADDRESS_256027] to enroll in an open -label 
extension (OLE) study pending study approval by [CONTACT_21980]/independent ethics 
committee (IRB/IEC) and the appropria te regulatory authority. Patients not participating in the OLE 
will enter the [ADDRESS_256028] patient has completed the Week 53/ET visit and will be based on the percent 
change in fasting TG from Baseline at the primary analysis time point (Month 6).  
The study for an individual patient will generally consist of the following periods:  
• A screening period of up to [ADDRESS_256029] 2 weeks and an approximately 2 -week Qualification 
Period (patients on stable diet, for optimal control of TGs and disease mana gement, known to 
the Investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to Qualification without the 
Diet Run -In Period)  
• The Treatment Period is [ADDRESS_256030] assessments at specified 
intervals throughout the 53 -week Treatm ent Period.  During the Treatment Period, Study Drug

4. STATISTICAL METHODS  
4.1. Data Management and Quality Assurance  
4.1.1.  Central Laboratory Data  
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ionis) and Medpace are responsible for the format of the laboratory 
electronic data transfers and the transfer schedule. Central laboratory data results are not stored in the 
EDC system. Medpace and Ionis are responsible for th e review of the clinical laboratory data. This 
process involves reviewing the patient and visit identifiers in the central laboratory data results data 
against the central lab data identifiers collected in the EDC system. Investigator sites have access to 
the data via lab reports sent directly from the laboratory or through the laboratory’s web portal (in 
which case Investigators only have access to data from their site).  
The Sponsor , Investigator and patients will be kept blinded to post -baseline laborato ry lipid panel 
results (TG, apo C-III, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, apoB, apoB-48, 
chylomicron -TG, VLDL, non-HDL -C, and apoA-1) which can jeopardize the blinding of treatment 
allocation, alter Investigator’s clinical practice, or are  part of study endpoints to avoid bias in the 
conduct of the study.  Beginning at Week 27 , if a patient has  an LDL -C > 130 mg/dL (> 100 mg/dL 
for patients with T2DM  or CAD  with Baseline LDL -C > 100 mg/dL ) on 2 consecutive visits , the 
LDL -C values for this patient will be unblinded for the remainder of the study . 
4.1.2.  Pharmacokinetic Data  
Ionis is responsible for the management and review of the PK data. This process involves reviewing 
the patient and visit identifiers with the clinical data collected in the EDC system. The PK data are 
not stored in the EDC system. Prior to unblinding of the final analysis, any PK concentration datasets 
provided to Ionis by [CONTACT_213361] 678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256036] Document Version No . 4.0

Related to:  SOP -GDO -WW -019 Page 21 of 72 identifiers to avoid inadvertent or accidental unblinding. The bioanalytical lab may provide Ionis with 
datasets containing dummy patient identifiers unrelated to the actual identifiers to allow review of the 
PK data.  
4.1.3.  Adju dicated  Data  
All AEs and SAEs that occur during the study that are consistent with an event of acute pancreatitis 
will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee according to the Atlanta classification of 
acute pancreatitis (Banks et al.  2013 ) as outlined in the Pancreatitis Adjudication Charter. In addition, 
data for epi[INVESTIGATOR_213290] 5 years prior to enrollment will 
be collected by [CONTACT_81804] ’s medical chart and these events will also b e adjudicated.  
All AEs and SAEs that occur during the study that are consistent with a MACE  will be adjudicated 
by a blinded, independent committee as outlined in the MACE Adjudication Charter.  
4.1.4.  Patient Reported Outcome Assessments  
The patient reported outc ome assessment s will be captured by [CONTACT_213362]. Patients will 
enter their assessments into the system using a study -dedicated tablet  and handheld devices. Ionis and 
YPrime are responsible for the format of the electronic data transfers and the transfer schedule. The 
patient reported outcome assessments will not be stored in the EDC system. Ionis and YPrime are 
also responsible for the revi ew of the data. This process involves reviewing the patient and visit 
identifiers in the assessment data against the data identifiers collected in the EDC system .  The 
YPrime system for data collection includes built -in measures to prevent missing items fo r any 
completed quest ionnaire . 
4.1.5.  Other  Data  
Genetic lab data will be provided by [CONTACT_213363]. Platelet antibody data will be provided by 
[CONTACT_213364], Inc.  Platelet and Immunology Reference Lab . Ionis, PreventionGenetics  and 
Versiti Wisconsin  are responsible for the review of the data, the format of the electronic data transfers 
and the transfer schedule . These  data will also not be stored in the EDC system but will be transferred 
to Ionis as external data.  
4.2. General Considerations  
4.2.1.  Data Presentation  
Descriptive  summary statistics including n, mean, median, standard error, standard deviation, 
interquartile range (25th percentile, 75th percentile), range (minimum, maximum) for continuous 
variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables will be used to summarize most data. 
Where appropriate, p -values will be reported. The minimum and maximum will be reported to the 
same num ber of decimal places as the raw data recorded in the database. The mean, median, lower 
quartile and upper quartile will be reported to one more decimal place than the raw data recorded in 
the database. The SD will be reported to two more decimal places th an the raw data recorded in the 
database. In general, the maximum number of decimal places reported shall be four for any summary 
statistic.  
Categorical data will be summarized  in terms of the number of subject s providing data at the relevant 
time point (n ), frequency counts and percentages.   
Percentages will be presented to one decimal place. Percentages will not be presented for zero counts.  
Percentages will be calculated using n as the denominator.   
Changes from baseline in categorical data will be summarized  using shift tables where appropriate.  678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256038] Document Version No . 4.0 
Effective Date:  [ADDRESS_256039] Document Effective Date : 15 Aug 2023  
Related to:  SOP -GDO -WW -019 Page 22 of 72 All statistical tests will be conducted using 2 -sided tests with 5% Type 1 error rates unless otherwise 
stated.  P-values greater than or equal to 0.00 01, in general, will be presented to four decimal places.  
P-values less than 0.00 01 will be presented as “<  0.0001”. 
Confidence intervals will be presented to one more decimal place than the raw data.  
Any outliers that are detected during the review of the data before database lock will be investigated. 
If necess ary, queries will be issued to the Investigator, to either correct or confirm the outlier.  
The primary endpoint will be assessed on the Full Analysis  Set (FAS) and Per Protocol Set (PPS), 
with the former being the basis for the primary efficacy analysis. The secondary endpoints will be 
assessed in the FAS. All safety assessments will be performed on the Safety Set (SS). PK endpoints 
will be assessed in the PK Set as applicable.  
Efficacy results will be summarized under the treatment to which patients are randomized. Safety and 
PK results will be summarized under the treatment which patients actually received. Should there be 
any cases in which a patient received treatment other than what was randomized, such cases will be 
discussed in the study report and noted in footnotes where applicable.  
All tables and figures containing efficacy endpoints will indicate whether they present raw data or 
adjusted results from the statistical model, with footnotes indicating the model used and covariates 
included in the mo del.   
All tables, figures and data listings to be included in the report will be independently checked for 
consistency, in tegrity and in accordance with standard Parexel (a CRO that is responsible for 
pre-programming datasets and TLFs for the Study) proce dures.  
Missing visits or missing data related to COVID -[ADDRESS_256040] 
of the study  and a dditional summary (s) and/or anal yses may be provided if deemed necessary.  
4.2.2.  Baseline Consideration  
Baseline for lipid measurements is defined as the average of the pre -dose measurement on Day [ADDRESS_256041] to Day 1  (last measurements from Qualification period and Scree ning 
period ), prior to administration of the first dose of Study Drug. If 1 of the 2 measurements is missing, 
then the other measurement will be assigned as the baseline value. If all pre -dose measurements  are 
missing, then the baseline will be set as missing . Missing  baseline value s will be  imputed using the 
multiple imputation method described  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  in the SAP.  Note that if on Day 1, there are 
multiple pre -dose assessments, then the last assessment with non -missing value will be used as the 
Day 1 pre -dose assessment . 
Baseline consideration for exploratory endpoints : 
1. Average worst FCS Symptoms  (abdominal pain , physical fatigue,  difficulty thinking , 
diarrhea , and composite symptom score) : baseline is defined as the average during the 
screening period and up to Day 1 ; an alternative baseline is defined as single observation 
collected at the first day of screening with a two -week recall.  
2. Highest w orst FCS Symptoms : baseline  is defined as the highest ( worst ) score during the 
screening period and up to Day 1.  
3. FCS Impacts , PROMIS pain interference, HR -QoL (PROMIS 29+2 Profile v2.1) , 
PROMIS cognitive function, and Patient Gl obal Impression of  Severity (PGIS) : baseline 
is defined as the last non -missing assessment on or prior to  Day 1  678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256042] Document Version No . 4.0

Baseline for categorical variable is defined as the worst of the last non -missing triplicate prior to the 
first dose of Study Drug . If only one or two measurements are available, the baseline w ill be 
determined from the available measurements.  
The baseline  for platelet  is defined as the average of all assessments prior to the first dose of Study 
Drug . 
The baseline for other measurements is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the first 
dose of Study Drug.

represent the patient’s status during that period of the study. Visits after Week [ADDRESS_256046] ( worst ) score, the highest score in each 
visit window will be determined.  
For other  data, i f there are multiple assessments within a visit window,  the assessment nearest the 
target day will be used unless two assessment s are equally near, in which case the average value will 
be used. For lipid data, l ocal lab data will not be used unless central lab assessm ents are not available 
at certain visit. When calculating the baseline and analysis endpoints, only if the data from central lab 
is missing, then the local lab data will be utilized.   678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256047] Document Version No . 4.0

4.9. Efficacy Evaluation  
4.9.1.  Analysis and Data Conventions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypothesis  
The study h ypothesis is that ISIS 678354  can significantly improve efficacy parameters and is 
well-tolerated for patients with FCS.  The null hypothesis for the treatment comparison will be that 
there is no difference between ISIS 678354  and Placebo  in the percent change in fasting TG from 
Baseline at  the primary analysis time point . The alternative hypothesis will be that there is a 
difference.   
Symbolically, this is expressed as follows:  
H(0): (test) = (reference)  
H(1): (test) ≠ (reference)   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling of Dropo uts or Missing Data  
If there is missing TG  data at baseline and primary analysis time point , a two-stage multiple 
imputation approach will be utilized . 
First, patients with a  missing fasting TG at the baseline will have missing values multiply imputed 
based on the observed baseline assessments from other patients.  The Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) method will be used to impute the missing values. The imputation model will in clude 
baseline fasting TG value and 2 stratification factors (history of pancreatitis and previous treatment 
with Volanesorsen)  (Schafer 1997 ; 1999 ). The TG values will be natural log -transfor med before the 
imputation process, then back transformed after imputation to create the imputed data set.  The SAS 
procedure PROC MI will be used to create 10 0 imputed datasets.  
The following pseudo SAS code and seed (2438291) will be used to perform the m ultiple imputation  
for missing TG at baseline:  
   proc mi data = TG seed = 2438291 nimpute = 100 out=TG2;  
transform  log(baseline);  
      Mcmc;  
  var PANCR Volan baseline;  
   run; 
The imputed baseline values will be me rged with the observed post-baseline data and used for the 
second stage of imputation . 678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256061] Document Version No . 4.0 
Effective Date:  [ADDRESS_256062] Document Effective Date : 15 Aug 2023  
Related to:  SOP -GDO -WW -[ADDRESS_256063] missing values multiply imputed based on the known assessments from the retrieved 
dropouts (patients who discontinue treatment before Week [ADDRESS_256064] TG assessments at 
Weeks  23, 25, or 27), if there are a sufficient number of retrieved dropouts . The imputation model 
will contain the following variables: baseline fasting TG v alue, fasting TG values at post -baseline 
visits and 2 stratification factors  (history of pancreatitis and previous treatment with volanesorsen) , 
and the multiple imputation will be stratified by [CONTACT_1570] .   
If there is no sufficient number of retrieved dropouts, missing TG value at the primary analysis time 
point  will be imputed using a “wash -out” multiple imputation approach  (Jump to Reference, J2R) . 
With th e approach , patients treated with ISIS [ADDRESS_256065] -baseline 
visits  and the 2 stratification factors  from the placebo group .  
The “wash -out” multiple imputation will be prefor med in the following steps:  
1. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used under the multivaria te 
normality assumption to impute all missing values  by [CONTACT_1570]. The variable list for 
imputations will include the baseline value , as well as all available post -baseline value , and 
stratification factors. To  conform to the multivariate normality assumption, baseline, and 
post-baseline fasting lipid data will be natural log-transformed before the imputation 
process, and the variable values will be back  transformed to create the imputed data set. The 
SAS procedu re PROC MI will be used in the multiple imputation . The MCMC method will 
impute primary analysis time point data  for each of the [ADDRESS_256066] 
imputation stage .  EM algorithm will be used to derive a set of initial parameter estimates 
for MCM C method. A non -informative prior (Jeffreys’ prior) will be used to derive the 
posterior distribution of the parameters. A total  of 100 imputed datasets will be created from 
the above 2 -stage multiple imputation process.  
The following pseudo SAS code and s eed (2438291) will be used to perform the multiple 
imputation  for each  treatment group : 
   proc mi data = TG2 seed = 2438291 nimpute = 1; 
transform  log(baseline) log(week5) log(week9)  log(month3)     
log(week21) log(month6) log(week29) log( week37) log(week45)

  var PANCR Volan baseline week5 week9 month3 week21 month6 
week29 week37 week45 month12; 
      by _imputation_;  
   run; 
If there is no missing data at baseline, then the baseline imputation will not be performed . 
The second  stage of imputation will be performed to create 100 imputed dataset s.  678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256067] Document Version No . 4.0

baseline fasting TG, the 2 stratification factors , and the  model  from step 2 )  
4. The variable values will be back transformed from nature log scale to the original scale in 
the final imputed datasets . 
For each of the 100 imputed datasets, the endpoint will be compared between ISIS 678354 treatment 
groups and pooled placebo  using an ANCOVA model for continuous endpoints or logistic regression 
for binar y endpoints as described in the primary analysis for each endpoint. The estimates from the 
100 fitted models will be combined to provide an overall estimate with corresponding confidence

[IP_ADDRESS].  Interim Analyses  
There is no interim analysis planned for the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Examination of Subgroups  
To evaluate the consistency of analysis results in the primary  endpoint over parameters such as 
demographic  and baseline characteristics , exploratory subgroup analyses will be performed  if 
supported by [CONTACT_33653] .  The subgroups include but not limited to:  
• Gender: Male, Female  
• Prior history of pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening : Yes vs. No  
• Previous trea tment with Volanesorsen: Yes vs. No  
• Region: North America, Europe  (including [LOCATION_008]) , [LOCATION_002]  
• Age: < 65 years, ≥ 65 years  
• Race: White  vs. non -White  
• Ethnicity : Hispanic or Latino vs. Not Hispanic or Latino  
• Diabetic status : No vs. Type I or Type II  
• Baseline TG : < median  vs. ≥ median  
4.9.2.  Primary Efficacy Variable   
The primary efficacy analysis will take place after the last patient has completed the Week 53/ET 
visit and the database has been locked, and will be based on the percent change from Baseline in 
fasting TG at primary analysis time point.  
The primary endpoint is the percentage  change in fasting TG from Baseline  to the primary analysis 
time point. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint is to compare the percent change from 
Baseline  to the primary analysis time point in fasting TG between each ISIS 678354 treatment group 
(ISIS 678354  80 mg, ISIS 678354 50 mg ) vs. pooled placebo using an ANCOVA model in the FAS.  
The ANCOVA model will use precent change from Baseline  to the primary an alysis time point  in 
fasting TG as dependent variable , the two randomization stratification factors , prior history of 
pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening  (yes vs. no),  previous  treatment with Volanesorsen  
(yes vs . no) and treatment group (ISIS 678354  80 mg, ISIS 678354 50 mg , placebo) as the fixed 
effect s and nature log-transformed baseline  fasting  TG as a covariate . To account for potential 
heterogeneity in variance, t he 95% CIs will be calculated using the robust variance estimator based 
on the Bell and McCaffrey method  (Imbens & Kolesár 2016 ). 
If patients have intercurrent event (s) before Week 2 3, e.g., treatment discontinuation, use of 
additional medication, changes in background or concomitant treatments, the Treatment  Policy 
strategy will be implemented, the patients’ assessments post intercurrent events will continue to be 
collected. All assessments including those post the intercurrent events will be utilized in the analysis .  678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256080] Document Version No . 4.0

Additional  sensitivity analyses using different  imputation  approach  with ANCOVA model will be 
conducted in the FAS to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results.  
1. Patients with missing TG value at the primary analysis time point will be imputed using a 
pattern mixture model. Specifically, for patients treated with ISIS 678354 who discontinue 
the treatment due to AE or lack of efficacy (i.e., informative missing), th eir missing fasting 
TG data after  the last dosing date  will be multiply imputed using the copy increment from 
reference (CIR) approach based on the estimates from of the placebo patients. The CIR 
approach is detailed in (Carpenter et al.  2013 ). The  assumption is when a patient 
discontinues treatment due to informative missing, from  withdrawal onwards he/she would 
progress in the same way as the patients in the  placebo group. For patients who discontinue 
due to other reasons  and all patients  from the placebo group, their missing data will be 
treated as non -informative missing,  and data will be multiply imputed based on the 
distribution of their own treatment group .  
2. All patients treated with ISIS [ADDRESS_256086] approach based on the estimates from the placebo patients . Missing 
TG values  for placebo patients will be imputed based on the distribution of the placebo 
group . 
Sensitivity Anal ysis 4: Non-parametric analysis with Wilcoxon rank -sum test ( FAS) 
A nonparametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test will be performed  on the percen t change in fasting TG from 
baseline to the primary analysis timepoint  in the FAS.  Missing data will be handled using the same 
multiple imputation method as the primary analysis . The estimates for each of the 100  imputed 
datasets will be combined to provide  an overall Hodges -Lehmann estimator of the location shift and 
corresponding 95% CI  between each ISIS 678354 treatment groups  group and  the pooled  placebo 
group.  
Sensitivity Analysis 5: Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275] (FAS) 
An additional sensitivity analysis using the [ADDRESS_256087] of missing data on  the result of the primary analysis.   
The sensitivity analysis  will be conducted as follows  using the imputed data based on the primary 
imputation approach  as described  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  in the SA P: 
1. For the placebo group, a positive constant shift ( δc) will be added to or subtracted from percent 
change of the imputed TG values  at the primary time point . The shift will be gradually 
increased  
2. For each value of the placebo shift parameter,  a positive constant shift (δt) will be added to  or 
subtracted from  percent change of the imputed TG values  at the primary time point in the 
active treatment groups . The shift will be increa sed in a repeated process until the treatment 
effect is no longer significant at 0.[ADDRESS_256088]

4. The 100 sets of estimates w ill be  combined with SAS PROC MIANALYZE as described  in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  in the SAP

Sensitivity Analysis 6: ANCOVA model using  log-transformed data  (FAS) 
The percent change from Baseline to the primary analysis time point in fasting TG between each 
ISIS 678354 treatment group ( ISIS 678354  80 mg, ISIS 678354 50 mg ) vs. pooled placebo will be 
compared using  ANCOVA model with log(y/x) as dependent varia ble, where y is the value of fasting 
TG at primary analysis time point,  x is the baseline value of fasting TG; and the two randomization 
stratification factors  and treatment group as factors and nature log-transformed  baseline fasting TG 
as a covariate. The model will provide an estimate of log post-baseline to baseline ratio for each 
treatment group as well as the ratios relative to the pooled placebo group and the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). The log post -baseline to baseline ratios will be converted back to the 
original ratio scale. The percent change from baseline for each treatment group will  then be calculated  
based on the estimated ratio  as 100% * (ratio –1). Similarly, the estimated upper and lower CIs for 
the ratio can be  calculat ed as 100% * ( CI –1). Patient s with missing fasting TG value at the baseline 
and/or primary analysis time point will have TG value multiply imputed using the multiple imputation 
methods described  in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  in the SAP.

Descriptive statistics and c umulative distribution curves will be provided for observed fasting TG 
levels and percent change in fasting TG in each treatment group for the primary endpoint . 
4.9.3.  Secondary Efficacy Variable s 
In order to control the type I error, a sequential closed testing procedure will be employed with the 
sequence of endpoints defined as in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  above. Testing of secondary  endpoints will be 
performed only if the treatment comparison o f the primary analysis of the primary endpoint is 
statistically significant  (p < 0.05) for both ISIS 678354 80 -mg and 50 -mg treatment groups . Testing 
of the secondary endpoints will be conducted according to the following sequence:  if the primary 
analysis of the first secondary endpoint ( comparison of percent change in fasting TG from Baseline 
to Month 12  between ISIS 678354 80 -mg treatment group and pooled placebo in FAS) is statistically 
significant (p  < 0.05) then the second secondary endpoint ( comparison of percent change in fasting 
apoC -III from Baseline to the primary analysis time  point  between ISIS 678354 80 -mg treatment 
group and pooled placebo in FAS) will be tested. However, if the treatment comparison based on the 
first secondary endpoin t is not statistically significant, then all endpoints of lower rank will be 
considered exploratory. This process is repeated with each subsequent secondary endpoint.

4.11.2.  Immunogenicity Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sample Level ADA Data  
Samples collected for IM assessment at baseline (Day 1 pre -dose), during treatment and 
post-treatment follow -up period including early termination samples will be analyzed for 
anti-ISIS 678354 antibodies (ADA).  
An evaluable sample will be designated ‘Positive’ based on both positive screening and confirmation 
assay results (i.e ., confirmed positive result), and otherwise will be deemed ‘Negative’. 
An unevaluable sample, for example, a sample not being stored properly, or insufficient volume for 
analysis, will be reported as “unknown”. Sample ADA results (screen positive/negative , confirmed 
positive/negative or unevaluable, and when applicable, titer of anti -ISIS-678354  antibodies) before, 
during, and after treatment with study drug (I SIS-678354  or placebo ) (sample ADA status) will be 
listed by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and day of collecti on.   
The sample ADA incidence (number) and incidence rate (percent) at each evaluated study time point 
will be determined and appropriately summarized by [CONTACT_213403], positive, and unknown status. 
Furthermore, titer over time will be also appropriately summarized (using descriptive statistics) as 
median, quartiles (25% and 75%), and range by [CONTACT_10566].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Subject Level ADA Data  
Subject ADA status overall (ADAS TAT) will be defined as ‘Positive’ status if they have at least one 
confirmed positive sample result at any time during the treatment or post -treatment evaluation 
periods; ‘Negative’ status if all evaluated ADA sample results during the treatment and post -treatment 
evaluation periods are ADA negative and they have at least one evaluable ADA result collected 
post-study drug treatment. Otherwise, a study subject will be assigned ‘Unknown’ ADA status.   678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256154] Document Version No . 4.0

Related to:  SOP -GDO -WW -019 Page 56 of 72 Furthermore, subjects with positive overall ADA status may be further classified into different ADA 
types (ADATYPE) based on their baseline ADA status and change in ADA titer post treatment as 
described below (Shankar et al.  2014 ): 
• Treatment -Emergent ADA: subjects with either  treatment -induced ADA or 
treatment -boosted ADA as described below:  
o Treatment -Induced ADA: ADA developed de novo (seroconversion) following study  
drug administration (i.e., formation of ADA any time after the initial drug 
administration in a subject withou t pre-existing ADA, i.e., baseline negative ADA) . 
o Treatment -Boosted ADA: pre -existing ADA that were boosted to a higher level 
following study  drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial drug administration 
the ADA titer is greater than the baseline titer by a factor of 8 -fold or more ). 
• Treatment -Unaffected ADA: pre -existing ADA that were not affected (boosted) following 
study  drug adm inistration (i.e., any time after the initial drug administration the ADA titer 
is 4-fold or less) . 
• For patient s with negative overall ADA status , ADATYPE would be classified as baseline 
negative or baseline positive, based on their baseline ADA status . 
Other subject level IM parameters to be calculated/defined may include but not limited to:  
• ADA category (ADACAT) will include  subjects with Negative, Treatment -Unaffected, 
and Treatment -Emergent ADA  status  as described above . 
• Subject ADA Status at Baseline (ADASTA TB): "Pos itive" if the subject has Week 1 
Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) tested as confirmed posit ive; "Neg ative" if the subject 
has Week  1 Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) tested as negat ive; "Un known" if the subject 
has Week 1 Day 1 pre -dose sam ple (baseline) unevaluable.  
• First day of ADA detected (TFSTADA): i.e., the first day positive ADA sample was 
observed, will be calculated by:  [CONTACT_10640] “positive” sample IM st atus - 
first dose date +1 . 
• Onset of treatment -emergent ADA (ON SETTE): i.e., the first day treatment -emergent 
ADA positive sample observed, and will be calculated for subjects with treatment -induced 
ADA and treatment -boosted ADA  by: 
o For treatment -induced ADA: the date of first sample has “positive” sample IM st atus 
- first dose date +1 . 
o For treatment -boosted ADA: the date of the first sample has ADA titer greater than 
the baseline titer by a factor of 8 -fold or more – first dose date +1 . 
• Last Positive ADA Study Day (TLSTADA): defined as the last positive ADA sample 
observed from the start of study drug treatment and will be calculated by: [CONTACT_213404] “positive” sample IM st atus - first dose date +1 . 
• Last IM Sampling Study Day (TLSTSAMP): defined as the last ADA sample collected 
from the start of study drug treatment and will be calculated by: [CONTACT_213405] - first dose date +1 . 678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256156] Document Version No . 4.0

Related to:  SOP -GDO -WW -019 Page 57 of 72 • Duration of treatment -emergent ADA (DURTE): i.e., the total duration of 
treatment -emergent ADA during the study, and will be calculated using the last sample 
result carried forward. This parameter will be calculated for patients with treatment -
induced ADA and treatment -boosted ADA.  
• Peak titer (PEAKTIT): the highest titer observed for the subject . 
• Time to peak titer (TPEAKTIT): the time to reach peak titer will be calculated by:  [CONTACT_213406]  - first dose date +1 . 
• Total number of ADA Positive Samples (NOPOSAMP): the total number of ADA 
samples being confirmed positive for the subject . 
• Total number of ADA Samples evaluated (NOADASAMT): the total number of ADA 
samples being collected and analyzed successfully with reportable results for the subject . 
Lastly, subjects with positive ADA status may further be classified as being transient or persistent 
ADA response, if there are sufficient number  of subjects with transient ADA status. Transient and 
persistent ADA definitions are defined below and based on (Shankar et al.  2014 ): 
Transient ADA response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at one sampling time point during the treatment 
or follow -up observation period (excluding the last sampling time point, which will be 
considered persistent unless shown to be undetectable at a later time) or  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the ﬁrst and last ADA -positive 
samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated by a period less 
than [ADDRESS_256158]’s last sampling time point is ADA -negative.  
Persistent ADA response:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including follow -up period if any), where the ﬁrst and last ADA -positive 
samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) are separated b y a period of 
16 weeks or longer or  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at the last sampling time point of the study 
treatment period or at a sampling time point with less than [ADDRESS_256159] level ADA prevalence, incidence, and positive ADA response being transient or 
persistent (if applicable) will be calculated as  the total number of and percentage of evaluated patients 
with IM negative, positive, and unknown status  by [CONTACT_10566] . Subject level IM paramet ers 
(as described above) , if applicable,  will be listed by [CONTACT_10644], and 
also appropriately summarized (using descriptive statistics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%) and 
range, by [CONTACT_10566].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Evaluation of IM  Impact on PK, PD, efficacy and Safety  
The impact of IM on PK, PD, and safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_213407] ( such as  plasma peak, trough and post -treatment ISIS 678354 concentrations , etc.) , 
PD biomarker levels, selected clin ical efficacy end points and safety measures by [CONTACT_213408], summarized using typi[INVESTIGATOR_10476], and presented graphically and/or in tables. 678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256160] Document Version No . 4.0

warranted at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist, medical monitor, and/or biostati stician.  
4.11.3.  Additional/Exploratory Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Percent Change in Fasting TG , apoC -III, apoB -48, and non -HDL -C at Mo nth 3  
The following tertiary/exploratory endpoints will be compared between ISIS 678354 treatment 
group ( ISIS 678354  80 mg, ISIS 678354 50  mg) and placebo using an ANCOVA model with the 
percent change  in original scale  as the dependent variable, two stratification factors and treatment 
group as factors, the corresponding  log-transformed  baseline fasting results as covariates  in the 
FAS. The same multiple imputation method as the primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be 
used for  imputing  missing data.  
• Percent change in fasting TG from Baseline at Month 3  
• Percent change in fasting apoC -III from Baseline at Month 3  
• Percent change in fasting  apoB -48 from Baseline at Month 3  
• Percent change in fasting non-HDL -C from Baseline at Month 3  
The change and percent change from Baseline in fasting TG , apoC -III, apoB -48, and non -HDL -C 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_51250].

and analysis . If patients complete less than 4 daily assessments in a week, then the weekly FCS 
symptom scores will be considered as missing  for the week.  
Item-level scores  and the symptom  composite score s, as well as their changes from baseline will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_213411].   
A summary of abdominal pain  using  the following categories will also be provided: no pain 
(pain  score : 0), mild (pain score: > 0 – 3), moderate (pain score: > 3–6), or severe (pain score:  > 6-10). 
The frequency  and percentage  in each category  will be tabulated by [CONTACT_213412].  
The change from baseline in the weekly  average item and composite scores  at the primary analysis 
time point (average of Weeks 23 to 27) and at Month 12 (average of Week s 49 to 53) as well as 
change from baseline in the highest (worst) item and composite scores at the primary analysis time 
point (worst of Weeks 23 to 27) and at Month 12 (worst of Weeks 49 to 53) will be analyzed using 
an ANCOVA model with the two stratification factors and treatment group as factors and the 
corresponding baseline score as a covariate , and will be conducted in the FAS.   
The analyses described above will also be repeated using the corresponding FCS symptom collected 
at the two-week recall administered the first day of screening as the baseline . 
The following t wo exploratory analyses will be performed in the subset of FAS patients who reported 
any abdominal pain (pain score > 0) at Baseline:  
1. The first exploratory analysis will be performed to compare the change from Baseline in 
the weekly average abdominal pain scores at the primary analysis time point (average of 
Weeks 23 to 27)  and at Month 12 (average of Weeks 49 to 53) between the ISIS [ADDRESS_256167] ( worst ) abdominal pain score at the primary analysis time point

The missing values wil l be imputed  as follows : 
• For patients with a missing baseline value, their baseline scores will be imputed using 
the average of non -missing data from other patients in the same  stratification category .

o history of pancreatitis  = No, previous treatment with Volanesorsen  = No 
o history of pancreatitis  = No, previous treatment with Volanesorsen  = Yes 
In the event of no observed data for imputation, history of pancreatitis  will be used as the only 
classification factor for the purpose of identifying non -missing data for imputation . Additional 
factors, such as age and gender may b e considered to further classify the imputation categories if 
supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
The item and composite scores will be imputed separately

The FCS Impacts Questionnaire includes [ADDRESS_256199] 7 days during 
the screening period and at each study visit using the following scale : Never = 0, Rarely = 1, 
Sometimes = 2, Often = 3, and Always =  4. Higher scores denote more severe  impacts.  
An impacts composite score will be calculated as the average of the non -missing scores across the 
[ADDRESS_256200] individual items. If more than 50% of the questions are missing, the impacts composite 
score  will be considered as missing for the visit.  
Item-level scores , impacts composite score and their changes from baseline will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_213414].  
The change from baseline in the impacts composite scores at the primary  analysis  time point (average 
of Weeks 23 , 25 27) and at Month 12 (average of Weeks 49, 51 and 53) will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model with the two randomization stratification factors and treatment group as factors and 
baseline score as a covariate , and will be conducted in the FAS. 
In addition to the analyses described above based on the observed data, the missing values will be 
imputed. The change from baseline in the impacts composite scores at the primary  analysis  time point 
and at Month 12 based on the imputed data will be analyz ed using an ANCOVA model with the two 
randomization stratification factors and treatment group as factors and baseline score as a covariate, 
and will be conducted in the FAS. 
The missing values will be imputed as follows:  
• For patients with a missing baseli ne value, their baseline score will be imputed using the 
average of non -missing data from other patients in the same  stratification category . In the 
event of no observed data for imputation, history of pancreatitis  will be used as the only 
classification f actor for the purpose of identifying non -missing data for imputation . Additional 
factors, such as age and gender may be considered to further classify the imputation categories 
if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
• The Month 6 (primary analysis time point) score will be calculated from  the non -missing 
scores  from Weeks [ADDRESS_256201] to Day 169 and within a ± [ADDRESS_256202] to the Day 351 and within a ± 30 days window.

• The PROMIS Pain Interference Short Form 8a contains 8 questions to assess 
self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of patients’ life over the past 
seven days. This includes the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, 
cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. The pain in terference score 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_10621] v alues of the response to each question to get a raw 678354-CS03   Statistical Analysis Plan     | 1.[ADDRESS_256210] Document Version No . 4.0

The T‐score rescales the raw score into a standardized T‐score with a mean of  [ADDRESS_256212] of pain on a patient’s life . If more 
than 50% of the questions are missing, the pain in terference  score will be considered  as 
missing for the visit. If less than or equal to 50% of the questions are missing, the 
missing items will be imputed using the average of the non -missing items and rounded 
to the nearest integer.  
The PROMIS 29+2 Profile v2.1 (PROPr) contains seven PROMI S domains (Physical Function, 
Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Pain Interference, Sleep Disturbance, and Ability to Participate in 
Social Roles and Activities), an additional pain intensity 0 ‐10 numeric rating scale (NRS), plus two 
Cognitive Function Abilities items. The PROPr score will be calculated as:  
• summing the values of the response to each question to get a raw total score for each 
domain . If more than 50% of the questions in a domain are missing, the domain  score will 
be considered  as missing  for the visit . If less than or equal to 50% of the questions in a 
domain  are missing, the missing items will be imputed using the average of the 
non-missing items in the same domain and rounded to the nearest integer.  
• converting the raw domain scores to T -scores using the PROMIS scoring manual.  
A T-score of 50 is the average of the [LOCATION_002] general population.  Higher symptom 
scores indicate  increased symptom burden and higher function scores indicate  better 
functioning.    
• converting the T‐scores to theta values: theta = (T – 50)/10 , applying SAS code using theta 
values to calculate a PROPr score. The code is named “MAUT” (Multi‐Attribute Utility 
Theory) and is availabl ithub.com/janelhanmer/PROPr .  The PROPr score s range 
from  0 (as bad as dead) to 1 ( perfect  or ideal health).  
• The PROMIS Cognitive Function Short Form 4a contains [ADDRESS_256213] seven days . The cognitive function score 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_213415] a raw 
score, then converting the raw score to a T -score using the PROMIS scoring manual.  A T-
score of 50 is the average of the [LOCATION_002] general population.  Higher cognitive 
function  scores indicate  better cognitive functioning.  If more than 50% of the questions 
are missing, the cognitive function score will be considered as missing for the visit. If less 
than or equal to 50% of the questions are missing, the missing items will be imputed using 
the aver age of the non -missing items and rounded to the nearest integer.  
The pain interference score, PROPr domain and total score s, and cognitive function score will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_213414]. The changes from base line at 
the primary analysis time point (average of Weeks 23, 25, 27) and at Month 12 (average of Weeks  51 
and 53  for PROPr domain and total score s and cognitive function score s, average of Weeks 49, 51  and 
53 for pain interference ) will be analyzed using an ANCOVA  model with the two randomization 
stratification factors and treatment group as factors and the corresponding baseline score as a 
covariate , and will be conducted in the FAS.

The yearly rate of ER v isits, all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and in-patient days  during the treatment period 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics . The yearly rates for each patient will be calculated as  
number of ER visits , incidence of all -cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or number of in -patient days  times

and the 2 stratification factors as the factors . The logarithm of time in year that each patient observed 
during the Treatment Period will be used as an offset variable .  
The yearly rate of  in-patient days  may be compared between pooled ISIS 678354 treatment group 
and placebo group using an ANCOVA model  with the treatment group  and the 2 stratification factors

4.12. Determination of Sample Size  
Based upon prior clinical trial experience with FCS patients, the SD of the percent change from 
Baseline in TGs is approximately 46%. With 14 patients in each ISIS 678354 treatment group and 
14 in the pooled placebo group, there would be a 90% power to detect a 60% difference between each 
ISIS 678354 treatment group and pooled placebo group at an alpha level of 0.05 (t wo-sided), 
assuming 60% reduction in the ISIS 678354 treatment patients and no change in the placebo patients.  
Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in this trial to account for potential early dropouts and to 
facilitate general safety evaluation . 
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to Cohort A or Cohort B and each cohort further randomized  
2:1 (ISIS  678354:placebo) and stratified for:  
• Prior history of pancreatitis within 10 years prior to Screening* vs. no history of 
pancreatitis or no history wi thin 10 years prior to Screening  
• Previous treatment with volanesorsen  
* History of pancreatitis is defined as a recorded diagnosis of acute pancreatitis or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213294]

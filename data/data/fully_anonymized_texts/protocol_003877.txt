 1.  OBJECTIVES 
 
INCB024360 is an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor w ith the capacity to 
normalize serum kynurenine/tryptophan (Kyn/Trp) rati os. The goal of this trial is to determine 
alterations in the tumor microenvironment of  melanoma, first using a regimen of INCB024360 
that normalizes serum Kyn/Trp ratios and then by [CONTACT_1583] a multiple peptide melanoma vaccine to INCB024360 treatment. The primary endpoint will be changes in the concentration and 
number of CD8+ cells, as CD8+ T cell number has been shown to have the best correlation with survival [ Erdag 2012], with each patient serving as their own control. If substantial changes at 
sites of tumor are detected (i.e., changes in CD8+ T cell infiltration)  in response to INCB024360 
alone or in combination with the vaccine, subs equent iterative trials  will be developed to 
determine the individual contributions of each agent.  
1.1 Primary Objectives 
 
Objective 1: To determine the extent to which a regimen of INCB024360 that normalizes serum Kyn/Trp ratios alters the tumor microenvironment of melanoma, including 
determining the number and character of tumo r-infiltrating lymphocytes as determined by 
[CONTACT_666986] (IHC) and gene signatures  
 Objective 2: To determine the extent to which continued INCB024360 treatment plus the 
addition of the multipeptide melanoma vacci ne, MELITAC 12.1, further alters the tumor 
microenvironment of melanoma, including de termining the number and character of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as determined by [CONTACT_666987]  
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
 
Objective 3: To determine whether a regi men of INCB024360 that normalizes serum 
Kyn/Trp ratios plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine changes the level or character of the 
vaccine-induced CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell immu ne responses as measured in peripheral 
blood, as compared to prio r published experience  
 Objective 4: To evaluate the extent to which INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine alters the number and character of peripheral blo od mononuclear cell (PBMC) 
populations, including T and natural killer (NK) cells, as evaluated by [CONTACT_666988] 5: To evaluate the extent to which INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine alters the PBMC transcriptome
  
 Objective 6: To assess the safety and to lerability of INCB024 360 plus MELITAC 12.1 
vaccine

 Objective 7: To obtain preliminary data on the tumor response ra te of INCB024360 plus 
MELITAC 12.1 vaccine by [CONTACT_666989] (ORR), time to tumor progression, 
and overall survival  
 Objective 8: To associate any observed cha nges with the expression of IDO1 protein by 
[CONTACT_666990]-infiltrating cells    
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Study Disease(s) 
 
Melanoma represents only 6%  of all skin cancer diagnoses, however, it accounts for 
about 85% of all skin cancer–related deaths [ NCI 2012 ]. The number of new invasive 
cutaneous melanoma cases projected dur ing 2010 was 68,000—a 23% increase from the 
2004 prediction of 55,100 cases. In 2015, the lifetime risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_666933] 1 in 50 [ Cockerell 2012 ].  
 Existing therapy for melanoma consists of ad equate surgical resection of the primary 
tumor and, in some circumstances, surgical res ection of isolated metastases. Most of the 
patients on the current trial will have disseminate d disease and be enroll ed after failure of 
standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. “Little consensus exists  regarding standard chemotherapy for patients 
with metastatic melanoma, which most likely reflects the low level of  activity of older 
FDA approved agents” [ NCCN 2012 ]. In general, disseminated disease can be managed 
by [CONTACT_666991], clinical trial or supportive care. Acco rding to NCCN Guidelines, 
“preferred regimens include ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645], vemurafenib for patients with documented BRAF mutation, treatment in a clin ical trial and high-dose IL-2” [ NCCN 2012]. 
“Although approval of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_666934], each agent has unique limitations” [NCCN 2012] and might not be appropriate for all patients. Other regimens for 
disseminated disease “include dacarbazine, te mozolomide, imatinib for tumors with c-
KIT mutations, dacarbazine- or temozolomide-based combination chemotherapy, or biochemotherapy (including cisplatin and vinbl astine with or without IL-2, interferon 
alfa, paclitaxel as monotherapy or in combination with carboplatin [ NCCN 2012]. These 
have demonstrated modest response rates under 20% in firs t-line and second-line 
settings.”  
 
Some of the patients on the current protocol might have in-transit metastases. According 
to the NCCN guidelines, “Treatment in the context of a clinical trial is the preferred option” [ NCCN 2012 ].

 2.3 Other Agents 
 
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 
 
IDO is an enzyme that catabolizes the essential amino acid tryptophan to kynurenine 
[Munn 2007; Katz 2008; Löb 2009; Soliman 2010 ] and IDO activation plays an essential 
role in the immunological tolera nce between mother and fetu s. In pregnant women, IDO 
activation decreases the concentration of tryptophan in th e blood and elevates levels of 
kynurenine, which, in healthy pregnancies, in creases with placental development. As a 
consequence, inducing IDO expression in the trophoblast suppre sses T-cell activity 
against the fetus [ Tatsumi 2000 ]. In murine studies, the administration of the IDO 
inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan cause d allogeneic fetal rejection [ Munn 1998]. Thus, IDO 
induction in the trophoblast and placenta is suffi cient to inhibit the immune system of the 
mother and prevent rejection of the fetus.  In addition to its activation in pregnancy, IDO is also expressed by [CONTACT_666992], including m acrophages and dendritic cells. Expression of 
IDO dampens the immune responses [ Brown 1991; Huang 2002; Mellor 2005 ; 
Schroecksnadel 2005 ]. Upregulation of IDO in infla mmatory cells has been shown to 
provide potent immunosuppression in auto immune disease, allergies, chronic 
inflammatory conditions, and chronic inf ection. Relevant to this protocol, IDO 
expression is also increased in macrophages and dendritic cells of melanoma metastases. 
Moreover, enhanced IDO expression in immune cells in the se ntinel node is an 
independent prognostic factor [ Speeckaert 2012 ]. 
 IDO is also overexpressed by [CONTACT_666993]. Such overexpression leads to tryptophan 
depletion and kynurenine excess, leading to T-cell immunosuppression, which can 
prevent immune recognition and attack on malignant cells, and might afford a tumor-derived mechanism of immune escape [ Liu 2009]. Because of this, IDO expression and 
enzymatic activity corre lates strongly with prognosis in multiple cancers. In particular, 
IDO1 has been observed to be chronically activated and overexpressed in many cancers, including ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, and melanoma. IDO 
expression and enzymatic activity correlates strongly with prognosis in multiple cancers 
[Liu 2009]. The expression of IDO1 correlates w ith more extensive disease and is an 
independent prognostic factor for reduced overall survival.   In one study, moderate to strong cytoplasmic IDO expression was present in all (15/15) 
melanoma lymph node metastases in patients with poor survival [ Brody 2009]. In other 
tumor types, increased serum L-kynurenine concentrations predict a poor prognosis in 
patients with diffuse large B-cell lym phoma treated with R-CHOP (rituximab–
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristin e, and prednisone) chemotherapy [ Yoshikawa 
2010]. In addition, increased tryptophan degr adation and increased IDO activity led to 
increased Kyn/Trp ratio in patients with ova rian cancer when compared with healthy 
controls. Furthermore, higher st ages of ovarian carcinoma were  associated with a higher 
rate of tryptophan degradation, and K yn/Trp ratios correlated strongly with 
concentrations of cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble IL-2 receptor alpha, tumor

 necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) recepto r, and the macrophage marker, neopterin 
[Schroecksnadel 2005]. 
 
Increased serum Kyn/Trp ratios have also been shown to correlate with immunological 
effects and disease progression in lung cancer and other cancers [ Liu 2009]. For example, 
patients with lung cancer had significantly higher Kyn levels, lower Trp serum levels, 
and elevated Kyn/Trp ratio compared  to normal controls (Table 2.3) [Suzuki 2010]. 
Although substantial overlap be tween normal and lung cancer values was demonstrated, 
patients with more advanced cancer te nded to have higher abnormal values.

 2.3.[ADDRESS_900367] IDO1 selective 
inhibitor to undergo assessment in a human clinical trial. INCB024360 is specific for 
IDO1 with potency in the nanomolar range (IC
50=7.1–12.7 nM) in both human tumor 
cells and dendritic cells, and reduces trypt ophan-to-kynurenine conversion as assessed by 
[CONTACT_666994] [ Koblish 2010; Liu 2010 ]. It is highly potent in reversing 
IDO1-mediated suppression of T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (EC
50=17.7 nM) with potency cons istent with its inhibiti on of tryptophan-to-kynurenine 
conversion. It demonstrates high selectivity  and does not inhibit other tryptophan-
catabolizing proteins such as tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or IDO2, nor does it 
influence tryptophan transporters. It has a greater than 1000-fold selectivity against a 
number of kinases, ion cha nnels, receptors, and transpor ters, and does not significantly 
induce or inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme s. INCB024360 has an excellent preclinical 
pharmacokinetic profile with an  oral bioavailability of 50% in rat and dog, with good 
tolerability and safety  profiles in preclinical rodent  and nonrodent studies of 28-day 
duration.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Animal Models In preclinical murine models, INCB024360 i nhibited IDO1 systemically in tumors 
and in tumor-draining lymph nodes with associated reduced tumor growth and 
enhanced lymphocyte activity. In mice, plasma  Kyn levels decreased within 1 hour of 
oral INCB024360 administration and remained  at minimal levels for as long as 
plasma levels of INCB024360 exceeded 1.2 µM (corresponding to the cellular IC
90 
value adjusted for plasma protein bindi ng [~8 hours]). Consistent with specific 
inhibition of IDO1 by [CONTACT_147081]024360, no reduction  in plasma Kyn levels was observed 
in IDO1–genetically deficient mice, despi[INVESTIGATOR_666935].   Furthermore, during maximal suppressi on of IDO1 by [CONTACT_147081]024360 in wild-type 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
11 
 mice, the plasma Kyn levels were similar to the baseline plasma levels in IDO1-
deficient mice, demonstrating that oral  administration of INCB024360 results in 
efficient and selective IDO1 inhibition in vivo.   Reduced levels of regulatory T cells (Tre gs) were demonstrated in the syngeneic 
tumors in mice that were administered INCB024360, compared with tumors in control mice. As a single agent, INCB024360 inhibited the growth of CT26 colon tumors, which express high levels of endogenous IDO1 when grown in syngeneic BALB/c mice [ Koblish 2010]. No effect was observed in tumor models using 
immunocompromised BALB/c nu/nu mice. Furt hermore, the effect of chemotherapy 
appeared to be enhanced with INCB024360 in preclinical models: in CT26 tumor–
bearing mice, tumor growth was reduced by 33% when doxorubicin was administered alone, by 25% when INCB024360 was admi nistered alone, and by 66% when 
administered in combination.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study INCB024360-101 INCB024360 is currently being evaluate d in an ongoing Phase I study (INCB [ZIP_CODE]-
101) conducted by [CONTACT_666995] s ubjects with refractory solid tumors 
[ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 01195311]. The study has used a 3+3 dose 
escalation design, with doses of INCB024360 ranging from 50 mg once daily (qd) to 
700 mg twice daily (bid). A total of [ADDRESS_900368] been treated: [ADDRESS_900369] common adverse events 
(AEs) (≥ 20%) include fatigue, nausea, decreas ed appetite, vomiting, constipation, 
abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspnea, back pain, and cough. The most common grade 3 
or 4 AEs were abdominal pain, hypokalemia, and fatigue (9.6% each). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 1 patient reporting a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of radiation pneumonitis at 300 mg 
bid, additional subjects were enrolled at this dose and no additional DLTs were reported. At 400 mg bid, 1 patient report ed a DLT of grade 3 fatigue, with no 
additional DLTs at this dose level. Another patient at 400 mg bid developed asymptomatic and transient hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_666936] 1 cycle of therapy and was able to 
continue dosing with INCB024360. Among the 18 subjects treated at either 600 or 
700 mg bid, no DLTs were observed. Do se escalation was completed based on 
preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmac odynamic data, which demonstrated that 
doses of INCB024360 above 300 mg bid achieved exposures exceeding the IC
90 
determined in nonclinical models and, in pharmacodynamic assays, reached a plateau for Kyn/Trp levels and ratios. In the fina l cohort of [ADDRESS_900370] of food on 
INCB024360 absorption was evaluated. No objective responses were reported. At 
2 months, stable disease was s een in 15 patients and lasted ≥4 months in 7 patients. 
The main AE reported in subjects receiving more than 2 cycles of INCB024360 has been grade 1 or 2 fatigue.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Study (INCB024360-201) 
INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201 is a Phase Ib/II study of INCB024360 in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_666937]. Between April and August 2012, 
8 subjects were enrolled in  the Phase Ib portion of the study and were treated with 
INCB024360 300 mg bid (Cohort 1), 300 mg  bid reduced to 100 mg bid (a 
continuation of Cohort 1 after hepatotoxity was identifie d), or 100 mg bid (Cohort 2), 
each in combination with 3 mg/kg of intr avenous (IV) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43852] 3 weeks. 
 The initial 3 subjects treated with 30 0 mg bid of INCB024360 plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_666938] 3 or 4 elevations of  aspartate aminotransferase/alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT/AST) on study da ys 76, 41, and 44, respectively. None of 
these subjects had elevated bilirubin, liver failure, or other evidence of severe liver injury. These subjects were discontinue d from therapy and treated with IV 
methylprednisolone followed by [CONTACT_666996] a tapering schedule until normal liver function recovered. At the time these elevations were reported, 4 additional 
subjects were already enrolled a nd receiving INCB024360 at 300 mg bid with 
3 mg/kg IV of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. All [ADDRESS_900371] normal liver function tests (LFTs). Yet, in response to the LFT elevations in the 
first 3 subjects on study and after di scussions with the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), the dose of INCB024360  was reduced to 100 mg bid in these 
4 subjects, and screening and enrollment c ontinued to evaluate an initial dose of 
INCB024360 of 100 mg bid.   
After approximately 2–[ADDRESS_900372] with grade 1 elevation of bilirubin and normal coagulation parameters. These 2 subjects improved after treatment with IV methylprednisolone and oral prednisone, until liver functi on parameters normalized. All 4 subjects

not develop hepatic toxicity after th e dose reduction. Thus, a dose-response 
relationship might exist for the de velopment of hepatic toxicity.  
 After these additional reports of hepatic toxicity, all subjects were removed from study treatment, and screening for the study was suspended. An additional subject had

 Plasma levels of INCB024360 and plasma le vels of Kyn were measured in serial 
samples. Steady-state linear pharmacokinetics  were obtained on or before day 8, and 
appreciable drug accumulation with increase s in mean area under the curve (AUC) by 
30% between analysis on day 1 and 15 wa s evident. The half-life was 2.3–[ADDRESS_900377] that signi ficant target inhibi tion was achieved at

significant target inhibi tion with doses of 50 mg bid or greater. In patients showing 
elevations at baseline, ≥300 mg bid doses normalize kynurenine levels. IHC staining 
of 11 patients demonstrated that IDO1 tumor expression could be observed in tumor cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, or both, in 10 out of 11 samples, and CD3+ T 
cells and Foxp3+ Tregs were present in  all examined samples. Based on the 
tolerability and thes e pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations, a dose of 
600 mg bid has been determined as the recommended Phase-II dose as monotherapy.   
In recent preliminary results from a Phase ½
 study of INCB024360 combined with

 2.3.2 MELITAC 12.1 Melanoma Vaccine 
 
MELITAC 12.1 consists of 12 melanoma-asso ciated peptides from melanocytic 
differentiation proteins (tyrosinase and gp100) and cancer testis  antigens (MAGE-A1, 
MAGE-A3, MAGE-A10, and NY-ESO-1), pl us a tetanus peptide that binds 
promiscuously to HLA-DR molecules and stimulates Th1 dominant helper T cell responses (nonspecific tetanus helper peptide) [ Slingluff 2001 ; Slingluff 2007 ]. In a 
Phase II clinical trial of adjuvant therapy in  patients with resected stage IIB to IV 
melanoma, MELITAC 12.1 was fo und to be more efficacious (i.e., immune response was 
higher) and demonstrated more complete immu nologic responses (i.e., greater cumulative 
T-cell responses) than vaccines with fewer peptides [ Slingluff 2007 ]. The 12-peptide 
vaccine was found to induce substantially higher immune response rates: 100% of 
vaccinated patients had immune responses to at least 1 peptide (detectab le in the blood in 
83% or in the sentinel immunized lymph nodes in 92%). The immunogenicity of 
individual peptides was maintained despit e competition with additional peptides for 
binding to major histocompatibility complex (M HC) molecules, with a broader and more 
robust immune response. Clinical outcome with  this peptide vaccine correlated with the 
immune responses measured in peripheral  blood lymphocytes. In subsequent trials, 
Mel43 and Mel44, when administering the vaccine without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), imm unogenicity was significantly enhanced. In 
earlier trials with GM-CSF, immune responses were detected after in  vitro sensitization. 
In subsequent trials without GM-CSF, immune responses could be detected directly ex vivo in 70–73% of patients [ Slingluff 2011 ; Slingluff 2009 ]. 
 This vaccine was well tolerated. In the most recent Mel44 trial (n=170), 8% of patients 
reported unexpected grade 3 treatment -related AEs, plus 10% with  grade 3 injection-site 
ulceration and 7% with grade 3 injection-site induration; the injection-site reactions were 
expected and not dose-limiting. One grade 4 to xicity was reported (hypoglycemia, <1%). 
Other common toxicities were evident for approximately 24 hours and commonly 
included fatigue, dyspnea, headache, and myalgi a. Mild AEs of rigor s/chills, anorexia, 
nausea, sweating, fever, and flushi ng were commonly experienced [ Slingluff 2011 ]. 
No concurrent comparator for efficacy was established in the nonrandomized trial of 
MELITAC 12.1. However, the disease-free surviv al (DFS) data with this multipeptide 
vaccine compared favorably to adjuvant tr ials of high-dose IFN (E1694 clinical trial), 
favorably with respect to studies E1684 and E1690, and  analogously to the Canvaxin trial 
in patients with resected stage III melanom a. The median DFS was 35 months (2.9 years) 
with a corresponding 1-year DFS of 76% (95%  confidence interval [CI], 60–86%), 2-year 
DFS of 59% (95% CI, 42–72%), and 3-year DFS of 47% (95% CI, 27–64%). In the more 
recent Mel43 and Mel44 trials, 3-year DFS was 52% in both trials (95% CI, 43–61%) and 
overall survival at 3 years was 76% (95% CI, 67–83%) and 79% (95% CI, 71–86%) 
respectively [ Slingluff 2009 ; Slingluff 2011 ].

randomized Phase II trials with several lo cal adjuvants (e.g., GM-CSF, dendritic cells, 
incomplete Freund’s adjuvant [IFA]), systemic low-dose IL-2, and systemic 
cyclophosphamide [ Slingluff 2004 ; Slingluff 2007 ; Slingluff 2009 ; Slingluff 2011 ]. 
Vaccination in IFA was more immunogenic th an pulsing peptides on dendritic cells, a 
finding supported by a separate randomized trial [ Slingluff 2003 ; O’Neill 2009 ]. No 
immunologic or clinical bene fit was evident by [CONTACT_666997] w-dose IL-2, GM-CSF, or 
cyclophosphamide [ Slingluff 2004 ; Slingluff 2009 ; Slingluff 2011 ]. Thus, the 
formulation proposed for this trial is peptide in IFA. 
 
2.4 Rationale 
 
The central thesis of this prot ocol is that an inhibitor of  IDO1 may decrease melanoma-
associated immune suppression and immune cell–associated immune suppression and 
increase the immune response at sites of tumor, specifica lly increasing both the total 
number of T cells and the number of melanoma antigen–specific T cells infiltrating the tumor. IDO expression and function arises from 2 potential sources: (1) tumors can 
overexpress IDO and (2) inflammatory cells can upregulate IDO in response to the IFN-
gamma secreted by [CONTACT_93247] T lymphocyt es. Overexpressed and upregulated IDO 
subsequently depletes tryptophan and in creases tryptophan catabolites, including 
kynurenine, that cause antigen-presenting ce lls (APCs) and cytotoxic T cells to be 
ineffective against established tumors. Data from animal experiments [ Munn 2012] 
demonstrate that IDO induction after vaccination serves as a negative feedback loop that 
dampens the immune response to dendritic ce ll–based cancer vaccines. An effective IDO 
inhibitor may reverse this particular form  of tumor-associated immune suppression and 
increase the response to tumor vaccines by [CONTACT_396462] T-cell responses to cancer 
antigens.   A relatively nontoxic regimen of INCB024360 as monotherapy has been shown to 
normalize serum Kyn/Trp ratios in patient s with cancer. That same regimen is 
hypothesized to inhibit the effect of IDO expression at sites of tumor deposition and 
thereby [CONTACT_666998]-induced antitumor immune response either at sites 
of tumor deposition or in the tumor-draining lymph nodes. In addition, the same regimen 
is hypothesized to increase the systemic i mmune response to cancer vaccines and/or 
allow vaccine-induced T cells to replicate and to function better at sites of tumor 
deposition. Because the melanoma multiple peptide vaccine, MELITAC 12.1, stimulates 
immune responses, has an excellent safety profile, and is presumed efficacious in the adjuvant setting, treating patients with INCB024360 before vaccination with MELITAC 
12.1 might increase the immune response to antigens expressed by [CONTACT_666999].  
 2.4.1 IDO Inhibition in Melanoma and T-cell Infiltration into Tumor  
 IDO is strongly associated with poor prognosis [ Gajewski 2005 ; Brody 2009], and 
dendritic cells in lymph nodes dr aining melanomas express IDO [ Lee 2003 ]. High 
expression of IDO in the sentinel nodes of pa tients with melanoma is strongly associated 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
16 
 with increased tumor burden and shorter survival [Lee 2011 ; Speeckaert 2012 ]. On the 
other hand, a recent biomarker study found that  high IDO expression in tumors before 
treatment was associated with improved outcome  after therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and that 
increases in T-cell infiltration during treatm ent were also associated with improved 
clinical outcome [ Hamid 2011]. 
 
IDO is induced by [CONTACT_20129]-gamma produced by T ce lls, and thus represents a potent immune 
regulatory pathway induced when activ ated T cells infiltrate tumors [ Mackler 2003 ; 
Zhang 2011; Zhao 2012]. The findings from this recent study emphasize the highly 
complex interplay of immune activation and suppression in the melanoma microenvironment and its association with T-ce ll infiltration. They suggest that patients 
whose tumors express high levels of IDO are those with immune signatures for whom an immune therapy may have a higher chance of success, and that clinical benefit is 
associated with an increase in T-cell infiltration of melanoma metastases. 
2.4.[ADDRESS_900381] lower risk of 
metastasis and death than patients with sparse or absent infiltrate [ Erdag 2012]. In 
addition, Slingluff has established that lymphoc ytic infiltrate in metastatic melanomas 
correlates with increased survival. Slinglu ff evaluated the composition and organization 
of immune cells that infiltrated 183 melanom a metastases in humans. CD45+ cell counts 
ranged from 0 to 2,142 per mm2 (Table 2.4.2). The most preval ent immune cells in the 
first metastases were T cells (53%), of which CD8+ T cells predominated (35%) and 
CD4+ T cells were less common (19%). B cel ls (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138) were 
present at high numbers (25% and 8%, respectively). Macr ophage lineage cells (CD163) 
accounted for 13% of the infiltrates. NK ce lls (CD56) and mature dendritic cells (DC-
LAMP) were rare across all samples, with  mean proportions of less than 1% each.

Three histologic patterns of immune cell in filtration were identified. Immunotype A was

 immunotypes represented 29%, 63%, and 8% of metastases with estimated median survival 
periods of 15, 23, and [ADDRESS_900382] correlates with survival were with 
CD8+ T cells. Whereas higher densities of CD8+ T cells correlated best with survival, a higher 
density of CD45+ leukocytes, T cells, and B cells also correlated with in creased survival. These 
reveal how the immune microenvironment can a ffect outcomes and also provide a method to 
quantify the effect of the IDO1 i nhibitor on immune cell infiltration. 
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_900383] induced higher response rates, and durable 
clinical benefit, but at the price of increased toxicity.  There is a need for additional 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666940], ideally at lower toxicity than 
combination of CTLA4 and PD-1 antibodies.  IDO and PD-1 can mediate immune escape of melanoma.  As effector T cells inf iltrate melanoma metastases, they produce 
interferon-gamma, which in turn can induce both PD-L1 and IDO.  Blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 can further increase T cell infiltration; so there is rationale to expect that IDO 
may mediate progression of can cer on PD-1 antibody therapy. [ Spranger 2015 ], 
[Gajewski 2015 patent  ] 
 
Combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_666941]024360 has induced significant transaminase elevations in 5 of 7 patien ts, when INCB024360 was administered at 300 
mg bid; the study was continued in 8 patie nts at a much lower dose of INCB024360 (25 
mg bid), with disease control observed in 6 of those 8 patients and irPR in 3 (38%). Thus, 
this small series suggests en couraging clinical ou tcomes with that combination, but there 
was unacceptable toxicity with a higher dos e of INCB024360. Treatment of patients with 
another IDO inhibitor (D-1MT) af ter prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_666942] s associated with dramatic 
toxicities, including hypophysitis, also raising questions about the toxicity  of CTLA-[ADDRESS_900384]-line therapy 
for advanced melanoma (based on data reporte d in 2015); yet most patients treated with 
these agents will progress on therapy. Addition of IDO inhibition to these patients offers promise for improving clinical response rate s, thus, a cohort has been added to allow 
addition of INCB024360 early after the last dose of PD-1 antibody (o r PD-L1 antibody).  
If data from this cohort support safety a nd clinical activity of INCB024360 when added 
to patients progressing on PD-1 antibody, thes e data will support future study of adding 
INCB024360 while continuing PD-1 antibody af ter failure to respond.  Also, biopsies 
obtained after progression on PD-1 antibody and after adding INCB024360 will provide 
insight into the role of IDO in mediating fail ure of PD-1 inhibition and the changes in the 
tumor microenvironment of adding IDO blocka de while PD-1 blockade remains active.

MD, Chief, Infectious Disease and Imm unogenetics Section in the Department of 
Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health. 
 A number of other (secondary) correlative stud ies will be conducted to evaluate whether 
a regimen of INCB024360 that normalizes serum Kyn/Trp ratios plus MELITAC 12.1 
vaccine changes the level or character of the vaccine-induced CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell immune responses as measured in peripheral blood, compared to each patient’s baseline. 
Evaluations will occur at baseline (week 0), again at week 3, week 6, some are done at 
week 14 and they are repeated optionally at week 16 only if the opti onal biopsy is done at 
week 16. Effector 8+ T-cell responses to MELITAC 12.1 will be measured by [CONTACT_20129]-
gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot) and with 
tetramers/multimers to 8 of the peptides in the vaccine. Effector CD4+ T-cell responses 
to MELITAC 12.1 will also be tested. Assays will be performed in the CITN Central 
Laboratory of the Tumor Vaccine Group led by [CONTACT_667003], MD, in collaboration with the

 The extent to which INCB024360 plus MELI TAC 12.1 vaccine alters the number and

5. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 Agent Administration 
 
Patients with surgically incurable stage III or IV melanoma and tissue amenable to serial 
biopsy will undergo pretreat ment tumor biopsy and receive a 3-month course of 
INCB024360 administered as a twice daily  continuous dosing oral regimen. The 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04

 MELITAC 12.1 vaccine has 3 components: 12-M P peptides, Peptide-tet, and Montanide 
ISA-51 VG vaccine adjuvant, which will be prepared together as an emulsion for 
administration.  Three (3) mL of emulsion will be prepared. Two (2) mL of this emulsion will be 
administered, with 1 mL at each of 2 vaccine sites. At each site, half of each dose (0.5 mL) will 
be injected subcutaneously and half (0.5 mL) w ill be injected intradermally. The remaining 1 mL 
of the prepared emulsion will be discarded.  
 
On day 21, a week 3 tumor biopsy will be collected and the effects of  inhibitor alone on 
the tumor microenvironment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_667009] 21 tumor biopsy, assessing changes in IHC and gene signatures.  
 Note:  The biopsy on day 21 is mandatory. For pa tients with only one or two tumors 
approachable for biopsy, available tumor bl ocks from prior biopsies can serve as the 
pretreatment sample.   Also on day 21, a vaccination regimen with MELITAC 12.1 multipeptide vaccine will begin, with vaccines administered on days 21, 28, 35, 56, 77, and 98  (Weeks 3, 4, 5, 8, 
11, and 14. MELITAC 12.1, will be administered intradermally/subcutaneously at a fixed 
dose of 2.[ADDRESS_900408] antibody treatment administration. Patients 
enrolled within the 6 week window will be enrolled in Cohort B and administered INCB024360 orally at a dose of 100 mg twice da ily continuously up to day 98 (3 months) 
plus vaccines. Patients who enroll in the study after confirmed disease progression on

The next nine patients will receive eith er 300 mg bid of INCB024360 or 100 mg bid  
(Table 5.1 ). For patient safety, if a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) occurs in the first three 
patients treated at the 300 mg BID dose level of INCB024360 + MELITAC 12.1 vaccine, 
the subsequent 9 patients will be treated with  the dose of either 300 mg BID or 100 mg of 
INCB024360 + MELITAC 12.1. If two DLTs occur in  the first 6 patients treated at the

5.1.2 Other Agent(s): INCB024360  
 
Combining INCB024360 with the multipep tide vaccine MELITAC 12.[ADDRESS_900412] common grade 1 or 2 AEs at the 
recommended Phase-II dose (600 mg) include fatigue, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and anorexia; to decrease the possibility of una nticipated toxicities with the combination, 
the dose of INCB024360 in the first [ADDRESS_900413] exceeded the IC 50 for the 
IDO1 enzyme (72 nM) by [CONTACT_8622] 37-fold and the IC 50 for the vasopressin 1a receptor by 
[CONTACT_8622] 4-fold (13-fold in single- dose studies) in the absence of any toxicity, so the risk of 
unintended pharmacological activity  is expected to be low. 
 
5.1.3 Other Agent (s): MELITAC 12.1  
 
MELITAC 12.1 vaccine comprises 100 μg each of the 12 melanoma peptides plus 190 μ g 
tetanus toxoid peptide (Pep tide-tet). Peptides are synt hesized under good manufacturing 
practice (GMP) conditions by [CONTACT_667010] (San Diego, CA; formerly Multiple 
Peptide Systems), reconstituted, mixed, sterile -filtered, and vialed under GMP conditions 
by [CONTACT_44873] ([LOCATION_013]). The 12–melanoma peptide mixture and tetanus peptide preparation 
are made as separate sterile aqueous solutions  to be administered in an emulsion with 
Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant (1 mL), us ing the 2-syringe method after emulsion 
stability and quality is verified. MELITAC 12.[ADDRESS_900414] ered in combination with Peptide-tet and 
GM-CSF in Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant to mo re than 200 participants enrolled in 
3 studies run through the University of Virg inia Human Immune Therapy Center (HITC) 
in collaboration with other centers (Mel39, Mel43, E1602) [ Slingluff 2007 ; Slingluff 
2009; Slingluff 2010 ] and 12-MP has been administ ered in Montanide ISA-51 VG 
adjuvant, with or without Pe ptide-tet in about 300 part icipants (Mel43, Mel44, E1602) 
[Slingluff 2010 ; Slingluff 2011 ; Slingluff 2009 ]. No data are available regarding the 
distribution and excretion of th e vaccine preparation. In vitr o studies have indicated the 
half-life of synthetic peptides in the presence of serum peptidases is short (approximately 
22 seconds) [ Brinckerhoff 1999 ]. However, in vivo data describing the  metabolism of the 
vaccine are not available.   In the first [ADDRESS_900415] frequent AEs for participants receiving the 12-MP in

 combination with Peptide-tet include maximu m grade 1 fatigue (49%), maximum grade 1 
chills (49%), maximum grade 1 headache (4 2%), and maximum grade 2 injection site 
reactions (69%).  Other common AEs include maximum grade 1 sweating (27%),

5.1.4 Other Modalities or Procedures:  N/A 
 
5.1.5 Investigational Imaging Agent Administration: N/A  
5.2 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity:  
 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) include all Grade 3 AEs regardless of investigator attribution or relatedness except for those listed below. Based on investigator determination the follo wing Grade 3 toxicities can be deemed non-
DLT:  
 adverse event with a clear alternative explana tion (e.g. due to disease progression) 
 transient toxicities ( ≤72 hours)  
 injection site reactions that are expe cted and do not require any surgical 
intervention or repair 
 abnormal laboratory values without associ ated clinically significant signs or 
symptoms    
 There are two exceptions to the above. Grade 1 or greater ocular toxicities will be considered a DLT. Grade 2 LFT elev ations will be considered a DLT. 
 In the event of a DLT, it will be determined by [CONTACT_667011]024360 AND the MELITAC 12.1 will be perm anently discontinued.  In cases of 
vaccine injection site reacti on or other vaccine related adverse events the INCB024360 
may be continued if the vaccine related a dverse event continues to show improvement. 
Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are further 
outlined in Section 6 . 
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines 
 
5.3.1 INCB024360 
 INCB024360 is neither a substrate nor an in hibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 
enzymes. Analysis of human plasma sample s indicated that INCB024360 is metabolized 
by 2 major pathways: O-glucuronidation and re duction. The identifica tion of the 2 major 
pathways and the enzymes responsible for thos e pathways has enable d the refinement of 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria around c oncomitant medications. However for safety 
purposes, the case report form must capture th e concurrent use of all other drugs, over-

 the-counter medications, or alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Hypothetically, inhibition of IDO could cause an increase in serotonin levels that could 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a cluster of AEs termed serot onin syndrome. This rare syndrome has been 
associated with some MAO inhibitors and w ith combinations of serotonergic drugs. 
Symptom onset is usually rapid, often occurr ing within minutes, and encompasses a wide 
range of clinical findings:  o Mild symptoms may only consist of increa sed heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated 
pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], myoclonus, and over responsive reflexes.  
o Moderate symptoms include additional abnormalities such as  hyperactive bowel 
sounds, high blood pressure, and hyperther mia. A temperature as high as 40°C 
(104°F) is common in moderate intoxication. Mental status changes include hypervigilance and agitation.  
o Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may 
lead to shock. In life-thr eatening cases, temperature may rise to above 41.1°C 
(106.0°F). Other abnormalities include meta bolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, 
renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia. 
 At this writing, no laboratory te st exists for serotonin syndrom e; therefore diagnosis is by 
[CONTACT_667012]. Management is based primarily on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_666946], the administration of sero tonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, 
and supportive care including the control of  agitation, autonomic instability, and 
hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest la rge doses serotonergic agents may benefit 
from gastrointestinal decontamination with act ivated charcoal if it can be administered 
within an hour of overdose. The intensity  of therapy depends on the severity of 
symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatm ent may only consist of  discontinuation of 
the offending medication or medications , offering supportive measures, giving 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_666947], and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_666948]. As mentioned a bove, the serotonin anta gonist cyproheptadine 
is the recommended initial therapy. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case 
includes administering atypi[INVESTIGATOR_666949] 
(e.g., olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Critically ill patients shoul d receive the above th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_666950]/or neuromuscular paralysis.  Patients who have autonomic instability such as 
low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics, such as 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or phenylephrin e. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia 
can be treated with short-acting antihypertensi ve drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; 
longer-acting drugs such as propranolol s hould be avoided as they may lead to 
hypotension and shock.  As mentioned above, weak cr oss-reactivity of INCB024360 to the human vasopressin 1a 
receptor, dopamine receptor, and carbonic anhydrase II may lead to changes in blood pressure or blood electrolytes. In 28-day toxicology studies, C
max values have exceeded 
the IC 50 for the IDO1 enzyme (72 nM) by [CONTACT_8622] 37-fold and the IC 50 for the vasopressin 
1a receptor by [CONTACT_8622] 4-fold (13-fold in single- dose studies) in the absence of any toxicity,  
so the risk of unintended pharmacological  activity is expected to be low.

be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of developi[INVESTIGATOR_666951].  Analysis of human plasma samples indicated that INCB024360 is metabolized by 2 major pathways: O-glucuronidation and reduc tion. The O-glucuronide (M9) was formed 
by [CONTACT_15924]1A9 and the reduced metabolite (M11) a ppears to be catalyzed by [CONTACT_667013].  Metabolite M11 is also further metabolized to M12, a product formed by [CONTACT_165970]. The id entification of the 2 major pathways and 
the enzymes responsible for those pathwa ys has enabled the refinement of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria around concomitant medications. It  should be noted that all 
three major metabolites (M9, M11 & M12) are inactive against IDO1 enzyme.  Use of any UGT1A9 inhibitor including: acitretin, amitriptyline, androsterone, 
cyclosporine, dasatinib, diclofenac, diflunisal,  efavirenz, erlotinib, estradiol (17-beta), 
flutamide, geftinib, gemfibrozil, glycyrrhetin ic acid glycyrrhizin, imatinib, imipramine, 
ketoconazole, linoleic acid,  mefenamic acid, mycophenolic acid, niflumic acid, nilotinib, phenobartital, phenylbutazone, phenytoin,  and probenecid propofol, qui nidine, ritonavir, 
Sorafenib, sulfinpyrazone, valproic acid, and verapamil should be avoided from 
screening through follow-up period.  Low-dose Coumadin (1 mg) is acceptable; however, doses that increase INR are not 
permitted. If an alternative to Coumadin-bas ed anticoagulants cannot be used, the INR 
should be monitored weekly after initiation of therapy and upon discontinuation of 
INCB024360, until INR normalization.

unexpected grade [ADDRESS_900419] us 10% of patients with grade 3 injection-
site ulceration and 7% with grade 3 injection- site induration; the in jection-site reactions 
were expected and not dose-limiting. One gr ade 4 toxicity was reported (hypoglycemia, 
<1%). Other common toxicities were evid ent for approximately 24 hours included 
fatigue, dyspnea, headache, and myalgia. Mild  AEs of rigors/chills , anorexia, nausea,

5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
Patients with surgically incurable stage III or IV melanoma and tissue amenable to serial 
biopsy will receive the sequential thera py with INCB024360 alone for 3 weeks followed

 by [CONTACT_667014]024360 plus 6 MELITAC 12.1 vaccines administered intradermally 
or subcutaneously on days 21, 28, 35, 56, 77, and 98 (weeks 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, and 14). 
 Serial biopsies will be obtained up to 14 days before starting INCB024360, on day 21 
(before the first vaccine), and on day 42 (a week  after the third vaccine ). When feasible a 
biopsy will be obtained at week 16 (2 week s after the sixth vacci nation). If possible, 
tumors will be biopsied from patients coming off study, including for progression of disease.  In the absence of treatment delays due to AE(s), treatment may continue for up to 3 
additional cycles of INCB024360 (a total of 4 cycles) after consulta tion with the trial 
Principal Investigator, CTEP, and the CITN, or until one of the following criteria applies: 
 Disease progression by [CONTACT_667015] (RECIST) or 
Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC) 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 Unacceptable AE(s) 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study 
 General or specific changes in the pa tient’s condition rendering the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
 If additional cycles of INCB024360 are d eemed appropriate for the patient, the 
INCB024360 will be given without the admini stration of the MELITAC 12.1 vaccines.  
 
Only the end of treatment biopsy will be obta ined if additional cycles of INCB024360 are 
approved for each patient. 
 In patients who are approved to receive additional cycles of INCB024360, a reduced 
volume of blood will be drawn for specific assays. (Study Calendar, footnote ***)  
 A delay of up to 60 days between treatment cycles will be allowed.  In the event of unexpected se rious AEs related to either component of the combination, 
treatment of the affected  participant with INCB024360 and/or MELITAC 12.[ADDRESS_900420]. Patients removed from study for unacceptable AE(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the AE. Unaccep table toxicity is defined as any of the 
following:  
1) grade 3 or 4 adverse event requiri ng the patient to be removed from study 
treatment,  2) DLT’s of grade 1 treatment related ocular toxi city, grade 2 alle rgic reactions,  
3) >2 cm ulceration at the vaccinatio n site or a vaccination adverse event 
requiring antibiotic treatment, debrid ement or narcotic management,

 NOTE:   Chronic inflammatory reactions at the vaccine sites are expected to occur 
in all participants who receive Montanid e ISA-51. Induration may persist for days 
to months, but is not expected to requir e additional therapy.  Sterile abscesses 
may occur in some participants.  These are not a basis for discontinuation of the 
vaccines.  However, if the inflammatory reactions develop significant ulceration of the skin (> 2 cm), then the patient would be taken off the study, however, this would not be considered a dose-limiting toxicity. 4) any unexpected grade [ADDRESS_900421] be documented in the case report form. The patient should be followed per protocol requirements.  AEs will be described and coded based upon the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Safety will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_667016]-related AEs.   
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 All toxicity associated with prio r treatment must resolve to grade [ADDRESS_900422] patient safety (e.g., influenza, minor trauma).  
 DLT’s include all Grade 3 AEs regardless of inve stigator attribution or  relatedness except for 
expected grade 3 injection site reactions. ( section 5.5) 
Based on investigator determination the following  Grade 3 toxicities can be deemed non-DLT:  
• adverse event with a clear alternative explana tion (e.g. due to disease progression) 
• transient toxicities ( ≤72 hours)  
• injection site reactions that are expected and do not requir e any surgical intervention or 
repair 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
36 
 • abnormal laboratory values without  associated clinically signif icant signs or symptoms    
 
There are two exceptions to the above:  Grade 1 or  greater ocular toxicities will be considered a 
DLT.  Grade 2 LFT elevations  will be considered a DLT. 
 In the event of a DLT, it w ill be determined by [CONTACT_667011]024360 
AND the MELITAC 12.1 will be permanently discontinued.  
 Vitiligo will not be considered a DLT.  Pages 33, 34 and 35 include tables for some of th e more common AE’s including instructions for 
handling.  For any AE’s not listed in these tables, proceed in the following manner: 
Grade 1 and Grade 2:  Continue to monitor, follow and grade these adverse events. Grade 3:  Stop Protocol Therapy in cluding both INCB024360 and MELITAC 12.1 
Grade 4:  Stop Protocol Therapy in cluding both INCB024360 and MELITAC 12.1 
 In addition, treatment will be discontinued for (a) Any DLT, (b) disease progression requiring 
other therapy, (c) noncompliance with study requirem ents, (d) other safety considerations in the 
judgment of the investigator , or (e) patient request.  
 The treatment regimen will be considered safe as long as the number of participants experiencing 
a treatment-related AE (DLT) does not exceed 33%.  If more than 33% of patients accrued are 
known to have experienced a treatment-related DLT, the study will be closed to further accrual, 
except that [ADDRESS_900423] 3 patients accrued will be acceptable and will not result in  the closing of the study.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. The 
following list of AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an observed AE ( Section 7.2 ) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting (via CTEP-AERS) in addition  to 
routine reporting.

presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In add ition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporti ng (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subs et of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to  expedited reporting to NCI vi a CTEP-AERS (except as noted 
below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidel ines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements'

 7.1.3 CAEPRs for MELITAC 12.1  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 12-MP and Peptide-tet vaccine  There is no reason to expect di rect toxicity of the melanoma  peptides, as they are not 
directly cytotoxic in  vitro. On the other hand, because  some of these peptides are 
identical or similar to a portion of a normal protein, risks of autoimmunity in humans are 
important to evaluate. Because no murine sy stem adequately models the human immune 
response to these peptides, the most meani ngful evaluation of th is peptide vaccine 
mixture is in participants w ith melanoma. We will focus th is study on participants with 
advanced melanoma (i.e., unresectable st age III or stage IV melanoma). These 
individuals face a high risk (>90%) of prematur e death, and the antici pated risk of short-
term or long-term toxicity of this vaccine preparation is minimal ( Table [IP_ADDRESS] ), although 
it might delay or decrease the risk of morbid ity and mortality due to melanoma in these 
participants. The potential implications of autoimmunity against cells of melanocytic 
lineage are illustrated by [CONTACT_667018]. Most of thes e are limited, often occurri ng in skin surrounding the 
regressing melanoma, but occas ionally occurring systemically. While pathogenesis of 
this phenomenon can only be hypothesized, it is r easonable to consider this a worst-case 
scenario.  
 
**All participants should be closely observ ed for AEs for at least 20 minutes after 
each vaccination. Any time thereafter, part icipants should report any AEs to their 
treating physician.

7.5 Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigati onal agent/intervention, radi ation or chemotherapy). A 
secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that  occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia 
[AML])  
 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 Treatment-related secondary malignancy  
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer tr eatment (including AML/MDS) should also 
be reported via the routine reporting m echanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.6 Second Malignancy 
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to th e treatment of a prior malignancy (and is 
NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY 
routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.

 serotonergic agents. Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors is prohibited.   
 Use of coumadin is discouraged.  Low-dose Coumadin (1 mg) is acceptable; however, 
doses that increase the INR are discouraged  and will require dose modification. If an 
alternative to coumarin-based anticoagulan ts cannot be used, dose adjustment of the 
Coumadin may be needed. Based on the observed magnitude of epacadostat (INCB024360)/warfarin PK interaction and PK/P D modeling results, for an epacadostat 
dose of [ADDRESS_900442]

Peptide-tet  is a slightly modified form of a 15 residue peptide p2 of tetanus toxoid 
(QYIKANSKFIGITEL), representi ng amino acid residues 830-844. This peptide binds to 
HLA-DR1, DRw15(2), DRw18(3), DR4Dw 4, DRw11(5), DRw13(w6), DR7, DRw8, 
DR9, DRw52a, and DRw52b, which account for 80–90% of the patient population. 
Because glutamine (Q) at the N-terminus can cy clize, giving rise to a slight change in 
molecular structure, we have prepared this  peptide as a 16-residue species, where an 
alanine residue (A) has been added to the N- terminus. Thus, the sequence of the tetanus 
peptide used is AQYIKANSKFIGITEL (Table [IP_ADDRESS]).

 8.3.3 Solution Preparation 
 
All vaccines are to be made in a certifie d, sterile laminar flow hood. The emulsion will be 
prepared as 3-mL quantities: 2 mL of this emulsion will be administered, with 1 mL of emulsion administered at each of 2 vaccine site s. At each site, half of each dose (0.5 mL) 
will be injected subcutaneously and half (0.5 mL) will be injected intradermally. The 
remaining 1 mL of the prepared emulsion is to be discarded.  
 The 2-mL dose of each vaccine contains 100 μg each of the 12 peptides listed in Table 1  
of Appendix E  and 200 μ g of tetanus peptide ( Table 2  of Appendix E ), emulsified in 
1 mL of Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant. See Appendix E  for complete solution 
preparation instructions.  
8.3.4 Storage Requirements 
 
Vials of lyophilized peptid es should be stored at ≤-70°C and protected from light. All 
peptide preparations are lyophi lized and stored in sterile vials sealed with a rubber 
stopper. Each lot of peptide has met the lot release criteria for identity, purity, TFA 
content, potency, pyrogenicity, ge neral safety, a nd sterility.  
 Ideally, vials of the 12-MP and Peptide-tet s hould be thawed just before preparing a 
vaccine (i.e., thawed at room temperatur e for 1–2 minutes before reconstitution). 
Repeated freeze-thaws should be avoided. Vial s that are frozen and thawed >[ADDRESS_900444] with FDA guidelines in 21 CFR, part 610.12. In addition, 1 vial of peptide will be submitte d to either the Clinical Microbiology 
Laboratory at the University of Virginia or Microbiology Research Associates, Inc. 
(Acton, MA).   MELITAC 12.1 vaccine comprises 100 μg each of the 12-MP mixture plus 190 μg of 
Peptide-tet. Peptides are synthesized under GMP conditions by [CONTACT_667023] 
(formerly Multiple Peptide Systems), reconstituted, mixed, sterile-filtered, and vialed under GMP conditions by [CONTACT_44873]. The 12–melanom a peptide mixture and tetanus peptide 
preparation are made as separate sterile aq ueous solutions to be administered in an 
emulsion with Montanide ISA-51 VG adjuvant (1 mL), using the 2-syringe method after 
emulsion stability and quality is verified.  After a peptide-based vaccine is mixed, the pr epared vaccine should be refrigerated until 
just before administration. Ideally, the vacci ne should be administered within 1–[ADDRESS_900445] be administered within 4 hours of mixing. If the vaccine 
is not administered within 4 hours of mixing, it should be discarded.

 9.2.1 Immunohistochemical Evaluation of Tumor Biopsies - Laboratory Correlative Study 
#1 
Tumors will be assessed by [CONTACT_77017] C for pattern of T-cell distribu tion and infiltration of cells 
expressing a variety of antigens incl uding CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD34, CD45, CD20, 
CD138, CD163, DC-LAMP, FoxP3, PD-1, and IDO1, as well as PD-L1 on tumors. The 
primary endpoint of the trial will be a change in the number of CD8+ cells infiltrating 
tumor (per mm2) comparing pre- and post-treatment biopsies for each patient. We will 
use the assessment of total CD3+ T cells and total CD45+ lymphocytes as confirmatory assays. IHC staining will also be performed to detect other key parameters including 
IDO1 expression, and presence and patterns of CD4+ T cell and FoxP3+ Treg infiltration. 
These antibodies all work in FFPE tissue sections.   Tissue sections will be processed with heat-induced antigen retrieval and stained as described  [Erdag 2012], using antibodies to CD4, CD8, NKp46, CD31, CD45, CD20, 
CD3, CD138, CD163, DC-LAMP, FoxP3, PD -1, and IDO1. EnVision™ System 
(enzyme-conjugated polymer backbone c oupled to secondary antibodies) and 3,30-
diaminobenzidine chromogen (Dako North Am erica, Inc., Carpin teria, CA) will be 
applied to develop the staining. Positive c ontrols for lymphocyte antibodies will include 
lymph node and for CD34 antibody, placenta. Ne gative control slides will use phosphate 
buffered saline instead of primary antibody, with other conditions held constant.  
 If the tumor specimen is too small for evaluation of all antigens, the priority will be CD8 > CD3 > IDO > CD31 > CD45 > FoxP3 > remainder. Stained sections will be 
reviewed for type, density, and location of  tumor-infiltrating immune cells, tumor cell 
type, necrosis, hemorrhage, and melanin pi[INVESTIGATOR_178718] t. At least 5 high-power ed fields will be 
examined. Fields with no tumor tissue, more than 50% necrosis, or hemorrhage will be excluded. Stained cells will be enumerated by a single pathologist on each core in a high-power microscope field, excluding cells with in blood vessels or in hemorrhagic or 
necrotic areas. Cell counts will be normalized to per mm
2. Alternatively, when automated 
image analysis software is available and va lidated, it may be used for quantification of 
the staining. Change in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes will be analyzed using standard descript ive statistical analyses described below.  
 Immunotypes will be defined by [CONTACT_667026] (CD45) and for intratumoral blood vessels (CD31) as described [ Erdag 2012]. 
 Additional histologic studies may be perf ormed as appropriate to elucidate the 
immunologic changes in the tumor specimens. If  IHC studies are need ed using antibodies 
that do not work well in FFPE  sections, or for immunofluorescence studies, one of the 
quick-frozen tissue samples will  be used for those purposes.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Site(s) Performing Correlative Study The primary endpoints (IHC for CD8 and CD 3) will be evaluated on FFPE slides of 
tumor tissue at Phenopath Laboratories, Seattle, WA. All other IHC will be performed at 
the University of Virginia.

 9.2.2 Gene Expression Analyses of Tumor Biopsi es, Fine Needle Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_666973], 
and Peripheral Blood—Laboratory Correlative Study #2 
 
Tumor biopsies will be obtaine d as described above for IHC analyses. FNA of melanoma 
metastases will be performed at each biopsy date, before the excisional/incisional/core 
biopsy; both tissues will be evaluated for ge ne signatures. Gene signatures will also be 
performed on PBMCs obtained before ther apy and on days 21 and 42, the same day of 
the tumor biopsies. PBMC gene signatures may be compared to data of tumor biopsy, 
immunologic response, and clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Specimen(s) For FNA a 22- or 23-gauge hypodermic needle will be inserted into the tumor and multiple passes with changing angles of inse rtion will be made through all quadrants of 
the tumor, while under suction. Tissue from the needle will be suspended in 10 mL of cold RPMI. For PBMC, a CPT tube will be drawn and processed as described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Handling of Specimen(s) Specimens will be collected at the clinical sites as described above and centrifuged at 
1500 rpm for 5 minutes at 4°C. The cell pellet will then be harvested, red blood cells lysed as per the technique described by [CONTACT_142586] [ Weiss 2011 ]. Cells will be isolated 
by [CONTACT_667027]. Samples will be stored 
at -80°C and then batch-sh ipped as described below. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_25476](s) All RNA samples will be batched and shipped on dry ice using FedEx

9.2.3 CD8+ T-cell IFN-gamma Responses to the 12-peptide Mixture, and CD4+ T-cell Responses to Tetanus Peptide—Laboratory Correlative Study #3 
 PBMC (and lymphocytes isolated from tumor bi opsies, when available) will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_20129]-gamma ELISpot assay for responses to  the 12-peptide mixture. Assessment of 
immunologic response will be base d on a fold-increase measure from baseline as well as 
using a positivity threshold. Since 11 of  the 12 melanoma-associated immunizing 
peptides are 9- and 10-mers, it is safely presumed that IFN-ga mma ELISpot responses 
among PBMC will derive from CD8
+ T cells. No depletion of CD4+ T cells is planned for 
the ELISpot testing. The frequency of CD8+ T cells specific to 8 of the 12 immunizing peptides will be confirmed using tetramers and flow cytometric analysis. CD8+ T cell

 responses will be assayed directly ex vivo (using viably cryopreserved specimens), after 
stimulation with the 12-peptide mixture (10 μg/mL each) at baseline (i.e., before 
initiating INCB024360 treatment), at week 3 (before the first immunization with 
MELITAC12.1), at weeks 6, and optionally at week 16 ([ADDRESS_900449] dose of 
MELITAC12.1).   Similarly, these assays will include the tetanus peptide and multiple controls (CEF peptide, negative controls, etc.). Responses to  the tetanus peptide wi ll be interpreted as 
helper (CD4+) T-cell responses.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Specimen(s) Whole blood will be collected into heparinized (green top) tubes.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Handling of Specimen(s)  Samples will be collected at room temperature and shipped to the CITN Central Laboratory the same day as the blood draw, so that the sample is received at the central

Version Date: [ADDRESS_900463] will be performed. Effects of IDO inhibitio n on systemic vaccine-induced immunity will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_667029] 12.1 vaccine. The 
comparator for immune responses will be published experience with similar patients treated with 
the same vaccine regimen but without INCB024360 [ Slingluff, 2011; Slingluff 2009 ]. If 
substantial changes at sites of tumor are de tected in response to INCB024360 alone or in 
combination with vaccine, subsequent iterative tria ls will determine the individual contributions of 
INCB024360 and the vaccine. From these data, we  will endeavor to associate any observed 
changes with the expression of IDO1 protein by [CONTACT_666990]-infiltrating cells.  The primary endpoint will be change s in the concentration and numb er of CD8+ cells infiltrating 
tumor before and after treatment with each patien t serving as their own control. We will use the 
assessment of total CD3 T cells and total CD45 lymphocytes as confirmatory assays. The histologic pattern of T-cell infiltration and changes in pattern will be concurrently assessed and chronicled. Whether to expect a small or larg e effect on the tumor microenvironment from the 
therapy remains unknown, thus the endpoint objectiv es are exploratory an d the trial is sized 
accordingly. A prior study of changes in the tumor microenvironment with systemic immune 
therapy (IL-2) identified significant changes in th e tumor microenvironment with a sample size of 
[ADDRESS_900464] on the tumor 
microenvironment. 
 
Each patient’s tumor(s) will be biopsied before therapy and during therapy to assess the extent to which INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.[ADDRESS_900465]  on immune responses in periph eral blood and on PBMC phenotype

[ADDRESS_900466] methods (RECIST and irRC), including physical exam and CT scans performed before therapy, at weeks 8, 16, [ADDRESS_900467] 4 weeks later (week 12), therefore obtaining the week  16 scan may be delayed an

criteria allow for reporting as “response” patients  that respond after a period of progression. The 
irRC criteria accordingly do not demand immediate cessa tion of experimental therapy with the first 
sign of progression.  In addition, the safety and to lerability of INCB024360 with MELITAC 12.1 will be assessed in 
this study utilizing the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0).

would be acceptable due to the timing of obtaining confirmatory response scans. 
. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_667030] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [ Eisenhauer 2009 ]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional

and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 NOTE: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repr esent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of m easurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient , these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 
5 lesions in total, representative of al l involved organs, shoul d be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves  to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstan ce the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal le sions) for all target lesions wi ll be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regres sion in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  Non-target lesions. All other le sions (or sites of disease) in cluding any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 11.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of  Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at ba seline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferre d to evaluation by [CONTACT_453674](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but ar e assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions  Clinical lesions will onl y be considered measurable when they are 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
68 superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules ). In the case of skin le sions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 Conventional CT and MRI This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_900475] slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e .g., for body scans).  
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, sp atial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image ac quisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_182579], and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable  globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used sh ould be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease. Furt hermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be 
the same as was used at baseline and the le sions should be measured /assessed on the same 
pulse sequence. It is beyond th e scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type 
of scanner should be used and the image acqui sition protocol should be  followed as closely 
as possible to prior scans. Body scans shoul d be performed with breath-hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  PET-CT At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and or al contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accu rately measuring cancer lesions over time. 
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not r outinely or serially performed.  
 Ultrasound Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations  cannot be reproduced in their entirety 
for independent review at a later date and, b ecause they are operator dependent, it cannot 
be guaranteed that the same technique a nd measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are id entified by [CONTACT_453675], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about  radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  Endoscopy, Laparoscopy The utilization of thes e techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, such techniques may be  useful to confirm co mplete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to de termine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_900476] normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response. Specific guide lines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurr ent prostate cancer) have been published 
[Bubley 1999; Rustin 2004; Scher 2008 ]. In addition, the Gyneco logic Cancer Intergroup 
has developed CA-[ADDRESS_900477]-line trials in ovarian cancer [ Vergote 2000 ]. 
 
Cytology, Histology These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in  rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic  origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria fo r response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between  response or stable disease (an effusion may 
be a side effect of the treatm ent) and progressive disease. 
 FDG-PET While FDG-PET response assessments  need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-P ET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of 
FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a posit ive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive F DG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of  disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not c onfirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to  determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD  will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow- up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the ba sis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to repr esent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-sp ecific medical literat ure for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
 NOTE: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions by [CONTACT_667032] (CR): Disappearance of a ll target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or no-nt arget) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
70 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decreas e in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% incr ease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest su m on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (NOTE : the appearance of one 
or more new lesions is also  considered progressions). 
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient sh rinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as refe rence the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-targ et Lesions by [CONTACT_667032] (CR): Disappearance of a ll non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be  non-pathological in size (<10 mm short 
axis).  NOTE: If tumor markers are initially above  the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be consider ed in complete clinical response. 
 Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of  one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion stat us. It must be representati ve of overall disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.   Although a clear progressi on of “non-target” lesions only is  exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_151956], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Prin cipal Investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions by [CONTACT_667033] (irCR): Complete disappear ance of all lesions (whether measurable 
or not, and no new lesions) confirmati on by a repeat, consecu tive assessment no less 
than [ADDRESS_900478] documented.  
 Partial Response (irPR): A ≥50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline in 
[ADDRESS_900479] 4 weeks apart. (NOTE: For irRC, index and measurable lesions are taken into account. At the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the products of the 
[ADDRESS_900480] perpendicular diameters (SPD) of a ll index lesions (5 lesions per organ, up to 
10 visceral lesions and 5 cuta neous index lesions) is calcul ated. At each subsequent 
tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesi ons and of the new, measurable lesions ( ≥5 
× 5mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
71 are added together to provide the total tumor burden:  
 
Tumor Burden = SPD index lesions + SPD new, measurable lesions  
 Progressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in tumor burden compared with 
nadir (at any single time point) in [ADDRESS_900481] 4 weeks apart. 
(NOTE: The appearance of 1 or more new lesi ons does not define progression but does 
preclude irCR).  Stable Disease (irSD): A 50% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline cannot 
be established, nor can a 25% in crease compared with nadir. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response (RECIST)  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since th e treatment started). The patient’s best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whi chever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is obj ectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measuremen ts recorded since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from th e time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as re ference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, includ ing the baseline measurements.

74 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
The proposed study is a Phase II, open label,  multicenter study of the administration of 
INCB024360, an IDO1 inhibitor, plus a multipeptide melanoma vaccine, MELITAC 12.1, in patients with advanced (i .e., surgically incurable stage III or IV) melanoma having tissue 
amenable to serial biopsy.  The first [ADDRESS_900483] 3 patients ( Table 5.1 ). This is a safety precaution due to unknown effects of the 
combination of INCB024360 with the multipeptide melanoma vaccine. Although both agents have excellent safety profiles, unexpect ed toxicities could occu r when used together. 
 Each patient’s tumor(s) will be biopsied befo re therapy and during therapy to assess the 
effects of INCB024360 and vaccine by [CONTACT_667036] ( Table 5.1 ). 
 INCB024360 is expected to normalize serum Ky n/Trp ratios, in turn altering the tumor 
microenvironment, which includes the number and character of tumor-infiltrating T cells. 
The addition of MELITAC 12.1, a multipeptid e melanoma vaccine, will be used to 
compare INCB024360 alone and with the vaccine.  Effects of IDO i nhibition on systemic 
vaccine-induced immunity will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_667037] 12.1 vaccine. The co mparator for immune responses will be 
taken from published experience with simila r patients treated with the same vaccine 
regimen but without INCB024360  [Slingluff 2011 ; Slingluff 2009 ]. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_900484] deviation of 143; median 94 pe r mm2.[ Erdag, Cancer Research 2012] 
   
The primary endpoint will be changes in the concentration and number of CD8+ cells 
infiltrating tumor pre- and post-treatment with each patient serving as their own control so 
that relative increases within each patient will be assessed. We will use the assessment of 
total CD3 T cells and total CD45 lymphocytes as confirmatory assays. Twelve patients 
should enable adequate power to discern large changes (e.g. increases of  about 1 SD of the 
original data set.) 
 
13.3 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
 
The study plans to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_900485] as their own control.  Patients without adequate sampling for immune responses 
will be replaced. Accrual rate of patients is  expected to be approximately 3 patients per month.

INCB024360.  
13.6.2 Evaluation of Response  All patients included in the study will be asse ssed for response to treatment, even if major 
deviations from protocol treatment occur or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: (1 ) complete response,( 2) partial response, 
(3) stable disease, (4) progressive disease, (5 ) early death from maligna nt disease, (6) early 
death from toxicity, (7) early death because of  other cause, or (9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).   [NOTE: By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usua lly designates the “ unknown” status of 
any type of data in a clinical database.]  All of the patients who met the eligibility crite ria (with the possible ex ception of those who 
received no study medication) will be included in the main analysis of the response rate.

treatment, major protocol violations, etc.). Ho wever, these subanalyses will not serve as the 
basis for drawing conclusions concerning treat ment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding 
patients from the analysis will be clearly reported. The 95% confidence intervals will also be provided.

84 APPENDIX C INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 
Information on Possible Interactions with Ot her Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers 
and Non-Study Healthcare Team 
 
 
The patient ____________________________ is enrolled on a clinical trial using the 
experimental agent INCB024360 (an IDO Inhibitor). This clinical trial is sponsored by [CONTACT_201439]. This form is addr essed to the patient, but  includes important 
information for others who care for this patient.  
 
INCB024360 interacts with many drugs that are processed by [CONTACT_6813]; it is very  important to tell 
your study doctors about all of your medicine before you start this st udy. It is also very important 
to tell them if you stop taking any regular medici ne, or if you start taking a new medicine while 
you take part in this study. When you talk about your medicine with your study doctor, include 
medicine you buy without a prescription at the dr ug store (over-the-counter remedy) or herbal 
supplements.   Many healthcare prescribers can write prescripti ons. You must also tell your other prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitione rs) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet . These are 
the things that you and they need to know:   
 
INCB024360 interacts with (a) certain speci fic enzyme(s) in your liver.  
 The enzyme(s) in question is UGT1A9. Hypothe tically, inhibition of IDO could cause an 
increase in serotonin levels that could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a cluster of adverse events termed serotonin syndrome. This rare syndrome has been associated with some MAO inhibitors and with combinations of serotonergic dr ugs. Symptom onset is usually rapid, often 
occurring within minutes, and encompasse s a wide range of clinical findings: 
o Mild symptoms may only consist of in creased heart rate, shivering, sweating, 
dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], and over-responsive reflexes.  
o Moderate symptoms may include additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, high blood pressure, and hyperthermia. A temperature as high as 40°C (104°F) is common in moderate int oxication. Mental status changes include 
hypervigilance and agitation.  
o Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may 
lead to shock. In life-thr eatening cases, temperature may rise to above 41.1°C 
(106.0°F). Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, renal failure, and disseminated in travascular coagulation; these effects 
usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia. 
 
 INCB024360 must be used very carefully with ot her medicines that need these liver 
enzymes to be effective or to be cleared from your system.  
 You and healthcare providers w ho prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
 Before you start the study, your study doctor wi ll work with your regular prescriber to 
NCI Protocol #: CITN-04 
Version Date: 27 Jan 2016 
 
85 switch any medicines that are considered “strong inducers/inhi bitors of UGT1A9 ” 
Inhibitors include acitretin, amitriptyline, andr osterone, cyclosporine, dasatinib, diclofenac, 
diflunisal, efavirenz, erlotinib, estradiol ( 17-beta), flutamide, geftinib, gemfibrozil, 
glycyrrhetinic acid glycyrrhizin, imatini b, imipramine, ketoconazole, linoleic acid,  
mefenamic acid, mycophenolic acid, ni flumic acid, nilotinib, phenobartital, 
phenylbutazone, phenytoin,  and probenecid pro pofol, quinidine, ritonavir, Sorafenib, 
sulfinpyrazone, valpro ic acid, and verapmil 
 Several patients on INCB024360 and coumadin (an anticoagulant blood thinner) have had 
elevated INRs, possibly from interactions wi th the CYP enzyme system. Thus, patients on 
coumadin should not be entered onto trial.  If coumadin needs to be administrated during or 
after the trial, INR needs to  be monitored closely.  
 Your prescriber should consult a medical refere nce to see if any medicine they want to 
prescribe is on a list of drugs to avoid.  
 Please be very careful! Over-t he-counter drugs have a br and name [CONTACT_159964]—it’s 
usually big and catches your eye. They also  have a generic name—it’s usually small and 
located above or below the brand name, and prin ted in the ingredient list. Find the generic 
name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharmacist’s help, whether there could be an adverse 
interaction.  
  Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly: You s hould not take more than 2 grams per 
day on a regular or ongoing basis.  This is  equal to approximate ly 6 regular strength 
tablets or 4 extra strength ta blets per day. Read labels carefully! Acetaminophen is 
an ingredient in many medici nes for pain, flu, and cold. 
o You should not be on anticoagulants (b lood thinners) such as Coumadin.  
 
Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.  
 
 You should check with your doctor or pharmacist whenever you need to use 
an over-the-counter medicine or herbal supplement.  
 
 Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your study 
doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.

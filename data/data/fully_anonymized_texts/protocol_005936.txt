MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231315] 16, 2013 2.0 Background Information 2.1 Introduction The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non-profit research and educational organization working to obtain approval for the prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Encouraging data has been obtained and submitted to the FDA from MAPS’ recently completed [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], IND #63-384 (MP1).  MAPS is currently sponsoring another Phase [ADDRESS_231316] (IRB) already obtained.  Ongoing and planned Phase 2 studies, along with the study described in this protocol, are laying the groundwork for an eventual End-of-Phase 2 meeting with FDA and possible Phase 3 multi-site MDMA/PTSD research studies.   The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_194885]-assisted psychotherapy in twenty-four veterans, firefighters or police officers with service related PTSD, and will seek to enroll roughly equal numbers of men and women. This study will include those with chronic PTSD of at least six months duration who satisfy PTSD diagnostic criteria despi[INVESTIGATOR_194886].  Full, medium and low dose MDMA will be assessed in Stage 1, as well as the benefit of three vs. two full dose sessions. Subjects who received the medium and low dose during Stage [ADDRESS_231317] the opportunity to cross over and take part in a second study segment, referred to as Stage 2, with three open-label experimental sessions. Stage 2 will be used to explore the optimal therapeutic dose of MDMA using a clinical titration dosing strategy.  MAPS’ initial U.S. pi[INVESTIGATOR_194887] 21 subjects, a majority (17) of whom were women suffering from PTSD related to sexual assault and/or childhood sexual abuse[1, 2] . Only two subjects had PTSD from war-related trauma (U.S. veterans of the Iraq War) and both were male. According to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Guideline for the Development of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of PTSD, it is desirable to examine treatment response in homogenous samples, conducting separate trials for different populations.  The findings from this proposed study in veterans, firefighters and police officers with service related trauma will be compared with results from our initial U.S. pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], mostly in women survivors of sexual abuse and assault.   In order to refine our triple-blind methodology, the proposed study will also evaluate three different doses of MDMA to determine their relative success in achieving blinding of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], subjects, and independent raters.   
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231318] study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to permit the enrollment of subjects with two medical conditions that were exclusion criteria in the previous trial; Hepatitis-C, and controlled hypertension. Should any subjects with these conditions seek enrollment in the study, they will be required to go through additional specified screening procedures and additional monitoring for safety during the experimental sessions.  A review of the published, peer-reviewed MDMA research literature is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_456].  This document should be reviewed by [CONTACT_194950].  2.2 Protocol Purpose  2.3 Supporting Information  2.3.1 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is a serious, worldwide public health problem for which a wider array of effective treatments is needed. In the U.S., the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general  population is between 6 and 10% [3].  Combat exposure can produce a form of PTSD that is “chronic, disabling and highly comorbid.” [4, 5], and that can be especially resistant to pharmacotherapy with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) [6]. PTSD is common in other countries as well [7-11]. In U.S. soldiers returning from combat in the Iraq war, the incidence of PTSD is as high as 18% [12], and it is estimated that the number of service members returning home from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with PTSD will be between 75,000 and 225,000 [13]. In 2004, the U.S. Veterans Administration spent $4.[ADDRESS_231319] of them from the Vietnam War [14].  Due to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the number of veterans disabled by [CONTACT_150850], and the cost of providing disability payments, has increased substantially since 2004.  In countries where there is endemic armed conflict, the incidence of PTSD in civilians is often far greater [15-17].  PTSD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a chronic illness [18, 19], associated with high rates of psychiatric and medical co-morbidity, disability, suffering and suicide [9, 18, 20, 21]. During an appearance at a gathering of mental health professionals on October 26, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that “Beyond waging the wars we are in, treatment of our wounded, their continuing care, and eventual reintegration into everyday life is my highest priority. ... I consider this a solemn pact between those who have suffered and the nation that owes them its eternal gratitude." [22]  An array of psychotherapeutic options exists for treating PTSD and two SSRIs (sertraline and paroxetine) are approved as PTSD treatments by [CONTACT_1622]. However, a significant minority of PTSD patients fail to respond adequately to established PTSD psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [23, 24], or respond in ways that are statistically significant but clinically inadequate. At least one study of paroxetine indicated that men with PTSD did not 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231320] 16, 2013 respond to this drug [25].  These findings suggest that there is still substantial need for innovative treatments for PTSD.   There is limited data about whether or not patients with war related PTSD are more difficult to treat than those with PTSD from other causes.  A recent comprehensive review stated that, “Most, but not all, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with combat (mostly Vietnam War) veterans showed less treatment efficacy than RCTs with nonveterans whose PTSD was related to other traumatic experiences. … Therefore, some experts believe that combat veterans with PTSD are less responsive than survivors of other traumas to treatment.  Such a conclusion is premature. … More clinical trials with combat veterans would be important and welcome additions to this literature” [26].    In recent years, there has been growing research into drugs or other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD.  Examples of this are virtual reality-assisted exposure therapy [27, 28] and D-cycloserine-assisted psychotherapy [29].  MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is another such approach that is being rigorously tested.   2.3.[ADDRESS_231321] effective psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Other methods such as psychodynamic therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have also proved to be effective in treating some aspects of PTSD symptoms [30]. Some people may have to undergo more than one treatment to reduce or resolve PTSD symptoms [31].  However, a recent meta-analysis concluded that all “bona fide” psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including all those listed above, are similarly effective for PTSD and had an average effect size of 0.25 [32].   One innovative avenue of treatment is MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, which uses psychotherapy in combination with a pharmacological adjunct intended to amplify and enhance particular aspects of psychotherapy. MDMA possesses unique pharmacological and psychological properties that may make it especially well suited for use as an adjunct to psychotherapy with PTSD patients [33-38]. This treatment consists of several administrations of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy within the context of a time limited course of non-drug psychotherapy over three to four months. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is hypothesized to reduce symptoms from all three symptom clusters experienced by [CONTACT_194951]: re-experiencing, hyperarousal and avoidance.  Anecdotal accounts, data from MAPS’ recently completed U.S. clinical trial, and preliminary data from MAPS’ Swiss MDMA/PTSD study, all suggest that MDMA may provide unique benefits to people with PTSD when administered in combination with psychotherapy. It may assist people in confronting memories, thoughts and feelings related to the trauma without increasing either fear or avoidance in response to this 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231322] these neurobiological changes. Paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft) are the only two drugs approved by [CONTACT_14399] U.S. for treating PTSD, and are known to act largely via serotonin reuptake inhibition. They may also block the down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, but it is not known whether they can arrest and reverse the hippocampal atrophy found in PTSD patients [39]. Another approach to treatment of PTSD is to develop drugs and/or psychotherapeutic treatments that will indirectly interrupt the destructive neurobiological changes by [CONTACT_194952]. Reports of past experience with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy suggest that it may be effective in this way. In fact, the biologic and psychotherapeutic approaches overlap and re-enforce each other. Knowledge about the connections between the neurobiological and the therapeutic effects of MDMA is far from complete, but it has been observed that MDMA acutely decreases activity in the left amygdala [40]. This action is compatible with its reported reduction in fear or defensiveness, and is in contrast to the stimulation of the amygdala observed in animal models of conditioned fear, a state similar to PTSD [41, 42].   2.4 Previous MDMA Research  As of June 2011, MDMA has been administered to approximately 540 research participants, in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, without any occurrences of drug-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) [43-56].  The highest initial and supplemental doses to be used in this study are [ADDRESS_231323] initial and supplemental doses (30 and 15 mg) are only five milligrams above the lowest dose (25 mg) used in some of these studies. Researchers have administered 75 mg of MDMA in a number of studies, including a study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD in Spain [33] and a series of basic research studies occurring in the Netherlands [e.g. 51, 57]. The addition of a supplemental dose half the size of the initial [ADDRESS_231324] subjects in prior 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231325] 16, 2013 investigations of this experimental treatment.  3.1 Primary Objective • Assess changes in PTSD symptoms via Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) global scores in participants receiving by [CONTACT_194953], one month after the second experimental session.  3.2 Secondary Objectives  The following objectives will compare full, medium and low dose subjects in the blinded portion of Stage 1:  • Assess changes in posttraumatic growth via Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) scores from baseline to the primary endpoint.   • Assess changes in global functioning via Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores from baseline to the primary endpoint.   • Assess changes in symptoms of depression via Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores from baseline to the primary endpoint.  • Assess changes in self-reported sleep quality via the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) from baseline to the primary endpoint. • Assess self-reported dissociation symptoms with the Dissociative Experiences Scale II (DES-II) from baseline to the primary endpoint. • Assess changes in Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory (NEO PI) scores from baseline to the primary endpoint. The following objectives will compare effects in specified subjects:  • Assess PTSD symptoms via CAPS, posttraumatic growth via PTGI, depression symptoms via BDI-II, global functioning via GAF, sleep quality via PSQI, dissociation symptoms via DES-II, and personality via NEO PI [INVESTIGATOR_194888] 2 in comparison to Stage 1 in crossover subjects. • Assess long-term effects of receiving active dose MDMA on PTSD symptoms via CAPS, posttraumatic growth via PTGI, personality changes via NEO PI, depression symptoms via BDI-II, global functioning via GAF, and sleep quality via PSQI one year after the final experimental session for each participant.  The following objectives will include exploratory analyses intended to inform protocol design:  • Explore the effects of each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session upon self-reported changes in consciousness, as those associated with a transformational or mystical experience via the States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ). • Assess the effects of a third active dose experimental session by [CONTACT_194954], BDI-II, GAF, PSQI, PTGI (in reference to start of the study), and 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231326] 16, 2013 DES-II scores at the primary/secondary endpoint and end of Stage 1/ Stage [ADDRESS_231327] experimental session in Stage 1 and Stage 2.  • Assess the ability of the investigators and participants to accurately guess condition assignment when asked to do so after each blinded experimental session. • Assess value of third experimental session in Stage 1/Stage [ADDRESS_231328]'s perception of experimental sessions at the primary/secondary endpoint and end of Stage 1/ Stage 2. • Correlate adherence to the Treatment Manual with Global CAPS scores using adherence criteria ratings to assess videos of psychotherapy sessions.  3.3 Safety Objective To monitor and ensure safety of participants during and after experimental sessions by [CONTACT_194955], psychological effects, adverse events, spontaneously reported reactions and suicidality.  • Suicidality will be assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) before, during and after experimental sessions and on selected days of telephone or face-to-face contact, with comparisons made between subjects in each condition. • Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) will be measured during each experimental session, and comparisons will be made for vital signs between conditions.  • Collect changes to pre-existing tinnitus and/or chronic pain symptoms using a visual analog scale, specifically in subjects with a medical history of tinnitus and/or chronic pain.  • Serious adverse events, adverse events and spontaneously reported reactions will be collected during the study according to Section 8.  4.[ADDRESS_231329] that will be used in this study is MDMA HCl manufactured by [CONTACT_147969], Ph.D., Dept. of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Purdue University in 1985.  See Section 4.6 below for more information. 4.1 MDMA Activity Related to Proposed Action MDMA has a unique profile of psychopharmacological effects making it well suited to intensive psychotherapy.  In the context of psychotherapy, MDMA has been noted to reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury while enhancing communication and capacity for introspection [58, 59].  In the first completed study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD, the Clinical Investigator of this protocol reported a significantly greater reduction in PTSD symptoms, as assessed by [CONTACT_31185], in people who received MDMA with psychotherapy compared to those who received placebo and the same psychotherapy [1].  Placebo-controlled clinical trials have confirmed that MDMA produces an easily-controlled intoxication characterized by 
[CONTACT_194956] # MP8 [ADDRESS_231330] 16, 2013 euphoria, increased well being, sociability, self-confidence, and extroversion [60-67].  Effects in samples of largely drug-naïve individuals are similar to those reported by [CONTACT_194957] (see for example [60] versus [68]).  An increase in positive mood, increased access to emotionally intense material, increased interpersonal trust and compassion for the self and others, and anxiolysis likely all contribute to the therapeutic effects of MDMA.  It is significant that MDMA reduces anxiety without depressing the sensorium or inhibiting patients' capacity to experience and reflect upon intense emotions. Increased interpersonal closeness may permit patients to explore upsetting thoughts, memories or feelings. Facilitated recall and unusual and potentially innovative shifts in thinking and perception may contribute to generating new perspectives about past or current thoughts, feelings and experiences.   4.[ADDRESS_231331] prominently as a monoamine releaser and uptake inhibitor [69-71].  Its direct actions on serotonergic, adrenergic and other receptors are considerably weaker.   4.[ADDRESS_231332] dosage level considered a full dose. All participants will receive an initial dose, and may upon agreement of the investigators, receive a supplemental dose half the size of the initial dose administered 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose.  This protocol will follow a randomized, triple-blind, dose response design that will compare three doses of MDMA. The initial doses are 30 mg for low dose, a medium dose of 75 mg, and a full dose of 125 mg.  Twelve participants will receive an initial dose of 125 mg of MDMA followed by [CONTACT_194958] 62.5 mg.  Six participants will receive an initial dose of 75 mg MDMA followed by [CONTACT_194958] 37.5 mg, and six participants will receive an initial dose of 30 mg followed by [CONTACT_194958] 15 mg.

Prior to the scheduling of MDMA, similar doses and regimens were used in psychotherapy [36, 37, 58]. The doses to be compared in this study have been chosen on the basis of the Sponsor’s ongoing initiative to develop a dose response curve of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD.  The initial full dose is expected to produce all the commonly reported effects of MDMA, including changes in affect, mood, and cognition and changes in feelings of interpersonal closeness and trust. The supplemental dose will prolong subjective drug effects without producing physiological effects any greater than peak effects occurring after the initial dose.   The 100mg MDMA initial dose will be administered in the first experimental session in Stage [ADDRESS_231335], will decide whether the same dose or an initial dose of 125mg (each with the corresponding optional supplemental dose) would be more likely to constitute the optimal therapeutic dose for each of these experimental sessions.  MDMA in bulk will be sent from Organix Inc., in Woburn, MA, to the Clinical Investigator, who has been issued the Schedule 1 license by [CONTACT_194959] (DEA). The Clinical Investigator and unblinded Randomization Monitor will oversee compounding by a pharmacist in a manner that will maintain the blind for the Clinical Investigator. The pharmacist will provide bulk lactose for compounding MDMA capsules.  The pharmacist will weigh the MDMA into doses of 125, 100, 75, 62.5, 50, 37.5, 30, 25 and 12.5 mg (calculated as the weight of the hydrochloride salt) and placed in gelatin capsules in combination with lactose used to ensure that all blinded capsules have similar appearance and weight. Capsules for the initial dose will be a different color from capsules used for the supplemental dose. All capsules will be compounded so that they weigh the same amount, but contain varying amounts of MDMA and lactose. Capsules for all experimental, triple-blind sessions will be prepared in such a way as to prevent Clinical Investigators and subjects from distinguishing contents of blinded capsules. Dosage for open-label sessions will be clearly indicated in the packaging.

As described in that file, MDMA was prepared for human consumption in 1985 by [CONTACT_147969], Ph.D., Dept. of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Purdue University.  The identity and purity of this MDMA was confirmed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in 1997 as described in DMF # 6293 and was found to be 99.87% pure. On August 12, 2002, Chemic Laboratories reanalyzed the MDMA at the request of the sponsor prior to starting MAPS’ first U.S. pi[INVESTIGATOR_120545]-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD. The analysis found the MDMA to be more than 99.7% pure. A more recent analysis performed by [CONTACT_194962]. Carl Hart on February, 2006, continued to find a high degree of purity. This analysis found the MDMA in question to be 99.9% pure.  This MDMA was used in an investigation of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy that took place in the U.S. with drug administration ending in 2008, and it was also used in non-sponsor supported study in 2006[76].

Participants will complete the SOCQ, a measure of alterations in consciousness related to mystical experiences, during the period of time between the end of each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session and before they leave the treatment facility the next day. Participants will remain at the study site overnight accompanied by [CONTACT_194963]. Participants will undergo three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental session, with the first integrative session occurring on the day after the experimental session.   A blinded independent rater, who will not be present during any psychotherapy sessions, will assess participant PTSD symptoms with CAPS, symptoms of depression with BDI-II, posttraumatic growth with PTGI, global functioning with GAF, sleep quality with PSQI, and dissociation with the DES-II. Changes in personality traits will be assessed via NEO-PI. Outcome assessments will be done at baseline, at the primary endpoint one month after the second experimental session, two months after the third open-label experimental session and at the 12-month follow-up and at equivalent points in Stage 2.

Outcome measures except for the NEO PI [INVESTIGATOR_194891] [ADDRESS_231353] group of subjects in this study may be conducted for exploratory purposes. Subjects will complete a separate consent process if they chose to participate in these studies.  5.1 Planned Duration of Protocol   Stage 1 will take up to six months (full dose group) or four months (medium and low dose groups) to complete after screening and baseline evaluation. The screening and baseline evaluation can take up to [ADDRESS_231354] experimental session is longer than a month, the CAPS should be repeated to show consistency between this score and the baseline CAPS. The open-label study segment for participants initially assigned to receive low dose or medium-dose MDMA (Stage 2) will last an additional five months from the single introductory and review psychotherapy session until the evaluation two months after the final open-label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session. The time period between the end of Stage 1 and the start of Stage 2 should not exceed 5 months for any participant with CAPS re-assessment done if there is an interval of greater than 8 weeks between the end of Stage 1 and the beginning of Stage 2. The 12-month follow-up will occur a year after the final experimental session for all participants who complete Stage 1 only, and a year after the final open-label session for any participants who enroll in and complete 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231355] subjects who withdraw from the study and are unblinded. Each participant will be assigned to one of the three dose conditions; 30 mg (low dose), 75 mg (medium- dose) or 125 mg (full dose). Twelve participants will be assigned to the full-dose condition, six participants to the 75 mg condition and six participants to the 30 mg low dose condition. The study will employ a blinded randomization procedure that will maintain the 2:1:[ADDRESS_231356] if required. In all other cases, the blind will be maintained up through the primary endpoint assessment. The participant, independent rater and both investigators conducting psychotherapy will be blind to condition assignment, until that point. Participants who drop out of the study or are withdrawn by [CONTACT_194964] 24 participants. Subjects who withdraw during Stage 2 or during the long-term follow-up portion of the study will not be replaced.  Prior to enrollment, subjects will be tracked with their initials and a screening number assigned sequentially starting at “001”. Subjects who meet the study admission criteria will be enrolled into the study and will be assigned a 4-digit subject number.  The first two digits identify the study number (08). The next two digits identify the subject within the site and will be assigned sequentially, with [ADDRESS_231357] six months duration where patients were unable to achieve remission despi[INVESTIGATOR_194892]/duration or who discontinued treatment due to lack of 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231358] PTSD of less than 10 years duration (from Iraq and Afghanistan Wars) while up to [ADDRESS_231359] PTSD of more than 10 years (including the Vietnam War). A subject would not be excluded for having more than one traumatic event, but would be excluded if a traumatic event not related to military, fire or police service was the major contributor to the PTSD symptoms. Participants must be at least [ADDRESS_231360] with veterans’ organizations, written advertisements, announcements placed on appropriate internet sites and the sponsor website, and word of mouth. Candidates may also be individuals who had previously contact[CONTACT_194965]-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD after that study had closed enrollment.  One of the investigators or their assistant will interview prospective participants by [CONTACT_194966]. If the prospective participant is interested in taking part in the study, the investigators will provide her or him with consent materials for review and consideration through postal mail or electronically. If, after review, a potential participant remains interested in taking part in the study, then he or she will meet with the investigators to complete the consent process. Participants will complete a quiz to assess their understanding of the consent forms.  Investigators will then review the quiz responses with the prospective participant to ensure that he or she correctly understands study procedures, risks and benefits.  5.3.1 Inclusion Criteria Individuals eligible to be enrolled into this protocol are participants who: 1.

Subjects who do not live within reasonable driving distance of the study site (equal to or less than an estimated two hours’ drive from the study site) must have a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194894]; 6. Are willing to refrain from taking any psychiatric medications during the study period, with the exception of gabapentin when prescribed for pain control. If the subject is on stimulants for ADHD at baseline, they can continue to use them at the same dose and frequency as long as they discontinue 5 half lives before each MDMA session and do not restart for 10 days after each MDMA administration. Any psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, will be tapered in an appropriate fashion to avoid withdrawal effects.

All psychotherapy sessions, including experimental sessions, may be recorded to audio and video, with all recordings preserved for research and training purposes.   After consenting to take part in the study, participants will be screened by a physician who will obtain medical and psychological history by [CONTACT_194969] a general physical examination, brief neurological exam and clinical laboratory assessments.   Additional screening for specific conditions: If there is evidence of liver disease by [CONTACT_969], physical examination or laboratory testing, hepatitis serology will be performed.  If there is evidence of significant hepatic disease other than Hepatitis C the person will not be eligible for enrollment, and will be advised to see their personal physician for further evaluation.  If Hepatitis C serology is positive and the potential subject has not already been evaluated for possible treatment of Hepatitis C, he or she will be referred to a physician with expertise in evaluating and treating liver disease. After this evaluation and after completion of any recommended treatment, if the Hepatitis C is judged by [CONTACT_194970].    If the potential subject has well-controlled hypertension and no other evidence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease by [CONTACT_969], physical exam or electrocardiogram  (ECG), and if the Clinical Investigator judges their overall health and other cardiovascular risk factors to be acceptable (family history, smoking, lipid levels, body weight, level of physical activity), they will be referred for exercise testing by a cardiologist and for carotid ultrasound.  If these tests fail to reveal evidence of significant vascular disease or other cardiac disease, the person may be enrolled if there are no other 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231366] and review medications used to control hypertension prior to enrollment.   Participants will also undergo the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnoses I Research Version (SCID-I-RV) to assess eligibility based on Axis I diagnoses, and relevant parts of the Axis [ADDRESS_231367] in the study. Visits will be scheduled consecutively as described in the Time and Events Table.   After undergoing three 90-minute non-drug introductory psychotherapy sessions with a male/female co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194889], study participants will undergo eight-hour long experimental sessions scheduled approximately three to five weeks apart, during which they will randomly receive either the low dose, medium-dose or full-dose MDMA on all three occasions. Participants will undergo one non-drug integrative psychotherapy session the day after each experimental session and at least two additional [ADDRESS_231368]. Participants will be asked to read a brief script for a computer program that will enable transcription of audio recordings from these sessions.  As safety measures, vital signs and a measurement of psychological distress will be assessed during the MDMA sessions. Level of psychological distress will be measured with the 7 point Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) scale immediately before MDMA administration and approximately every 90 minutes thereafter for the duration of the MDMA sessions. Suicidality will be assessed throughout the course of the study with the clinician-administered C-SSRS. The C-SSRS will be administered during nearly every 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231369] one and not three preparatory (introductory) sessions.   6.1.[ADDRESS_231370] of symptoms on the patient's social and occupational functioning, overall severity of the symptom complex and global improvement since baseline and the validity of the ratings obtained. The CAPS takes approximately one hour to complete. The CAPS interviews have been determined to have good internal consistency, concurrent validity, and test/retest reliability [78, 79]. An independent rater will assess all participants according to the Time and Events table.  The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) is a measure of global functioning and general function made through observations. The GAF consists of a single score, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 reflecting superior function and zero reflecting serious risk of causing harm to the self or others. The GAF will be recorded by [CONTACT_194971].  The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a 21-item a self-report measure of depressive symptoms [80] that will serve as a measure of depression. It takes five to ten minutes to complete. Participants will complete the BDI-II according to the Time and Events table.  The Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) is a 21-item self-report measure of perceived growth or benefits occurring after a traumatic event. It contains five subscales; relationship to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spi[INVESTIGATOR_116172], and appreciation of life. In this study, participants will complete the PTGI in reference to the time since the trauma at baseline, but will respond in reference to the beginning of their participation in the study on all subsequent occasions. Participants will complete the PTGI according to the Time and Events table.   The DES-II is a 28-item self-report measure of dissociation, defined as a lack of normal integration of an individual’s thoughts, feelings, or experiences into the stream of consciousness or memory [81, 82]. It is an established measure of dissociative symptoms. The scale consists of statements describing facets of dissociation. Respondents indicate how often the specific experience happens to them, from “never” to “always.” Responses 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231371] 16, 2013 on the original scale were made via visual analog scales. The DES-II uses the same items but with responses made on a ten-point scale from “0%” to “100%” of the time. The scale is scored by [CONTACT_194972] a total score. The DES-II can also be used to produce scores for three factors, amnesia, depersonalization, and derealization. The scale differentiated between respondents without psychiatric disorders or with psychiatric disorders with few dissociative symptoms and respondents with psychiatric disorders associated with dissociative symptoms [81]. Reliability of the DES-II is high (ranging from 0.79 to 0.96 in an early review), and a reported Cronbach’s alpha of 0.95 [82, 83]. There may be a relationship between experiencing dissociation and occurrence of chronic PTSD [82, 84].  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) is a measure of self-reported sleep quality over a one month period. The PSQI was designed to be a reliable, standardized measure able to distinguish between good and poor sleepers. It consists of 19 items, with possible responses ranging from 0 to 4 on a five-point scale [85]. The PSQI consists of seven sub-scales: sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133527], and daytime dysfunction. These are all summed to produce a single global scale. Global scores can range from [ADDRESS_231372] reliability ranges from 0.85 to 0.87, and it is internally consistent, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83[85, 86]. Global scores correlate with other measures of alertness and self-reported sleep quality [87]. PSQI will be administered according to the Time and Events table.  The NEO PI [INVESTIGATOR_152428] a measurement of personality [88]. The NEO PI [CONTACT_832] a 240-item self-report assessment that takes between 30 and 40 minutes to complete. It is a well-established measure of five personality traits with sound properties of reliability and validity that operationally define personality structure according to a five-factor model. Participants will complete the NEO PI [INVESTIGATOR_194895].  The States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ) is a 100-item questionnaire based on the “Peak Experience Profile” designed by [CONTACT_194973] [89, 90]. Participants respond to the SOCQ using a six-point Likert-type scale anchored at 0=none at all and 5=extreme (more than ever before in my life). It has seven subscale scores; internal unity, external unity, transcendence of time and space, ineffability and paradoxicality (claim of difficulty in describing the experience in words), sense of sacredness, noetic quality, and deeply felt positive mood. The measure is a self-report instrument and takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Participants will complete the SOCQ after each experimental session in accordance with the Time and Events table, completing the measure at any time between the end of an experimental session and prior to leaving the treatment facility the next day.  
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231373] 16, 2013 The long-term follow up questionnaire has been developed internally by [CONTACT_194974]-term benefits and harms of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy at the 12 month follow up visit. This questionnaire takes between five and ten minutes to complete.  6.1.2 Safety Measures Safety measures will be applied as described below to minimize risks associated with drug-assisted psychotherapy sessions.  Participants will rate their current degree of subjective distress with a single-item, self-report scale, the SUD scale, repeatedly during the MDMA session, with the degree of distress marked along seven points.  Subjective psychological distress will be measured periodically throughout each experimental session.  Cardiovascular effects will be assessed via blood pressure and pulse measurement.   Blood pressure, heart rate (as pulse) and temperature will be measured periodically during each experimental session. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured at the outset of the experimental session, once every [ADDRESS_231374] potential suicidal thoughts or behaviors during a clinical trial [91]. It consists of a “Baseline” form that assesses lifetime suicidal ideation, ideation intensity and behavior, and a form for assessing current suicidal ideation, and intensity. The C-SSRS consists of a series of questions, and can be administered during face-to-face interview or over the telephone. The C-SSRS will be administered by [CONTACT_194975]. The measure will be administered at baseline, during the second 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231375] 16, 2013 preparatory session, twice during experimental sessions (once before and once after drug administration), on two days of telephone contact, during each integrative psychotherapy session and at the evaluation at the end of Stage 1, end of Stage 2 and the 12-month follow-up.  Participants undergoing medication washout will complete the C-SSRS before and after medication washout.    A 100-millimeter visual analog scale will be used to assess changes in symptoms of pre-existing tinnitus and/or chronic pain [92-94]. The Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale will allow rating of symptom severity from “None” to “Worst Case Imaginable”. This exploratory measure will enable quantification of subjective somatic symptoms that are known to be associated with PTSD [93, 95-97]. Presence of chronic pain is associated with PTSD, possibly as a result of psychological response to traumatic stress as reflected in brain activity, such as increased amygdalar activity in response to pain and transmitter systems involved in the stress response [93, 96, 97].  All adverse events (AEs) and spontaneously reported reactions will be collected during each experimental session and for [ADDRESS_231376] frequently reported in the literature and include: anxiety, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, headache, heavy legs, impaired judgment, impaired gait/balance, increased irritability, increased personal worries or rumination, insomnia, jaw clenching, tight jaw, lack of appetite, low mood, nausea, need more sleep, nystagmus, parasthesias, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], restlessness, sensitivity to cold, thirst and weakness. Serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to subject withdrawal from the study, and changes to psychiatric status will be collected throughout the protocol. Medications used to treat the specified AEs will be collected during the study, and all changes to psychiatric medications will be collected throughout the study.  6.1.3 Process Measures Adherence criteria and competence ratings will be conducted by [CONTACT_3784], trained blinded adherence raters who will analyze audio/video data from selected preparatory, experimental and integrative sessions. Participants will be asked to read a brief script for a computer program that will enable transcription of audio recordings from these sessions. The elements included in adherence criteria are specific to each type of session. The goal of these ratings will be to correlate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194896] a part of the sponsor’s ongoing efforts to standardize treatment methods of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD.   Belief of condition assignment and certainty will be collected from each therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194897] 1. At the primary endpoint, the Independent Rater for the study will also provide their guess and certainty of condition 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231377] 16, 2013 assignment prior to unblinding. These beliefs are collected as a part of the sponsor’s ongoing initiative to optimize the triple-blind as a part of dose response studies.   Subject opi[INVESTIGATOR_194898] 2-month follow-up in Stage 1. Stage 2 subjects will complete the same measure at the Secondary Endpoint and the 2-month follow-up in Stage 2. These opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153] (referred to as “perceptions” in the Time and Events Table) are collected as a part of the sponsor’s ongoing initiative to assess the therapeutic value of the third experimental session and to gather information on the optimal therapeutic dose for MDMA.  The Reactions to Research Participation Questionnaire (RRPQ) [98] is an assessment of causes for taking part in research and responses to the experience of being a research subject. Subjects will complete this measure during their 2-month follow-up, with exact time of completion varying in accordance with participation in the third open label experimental session in Stage [ADDRESS_231378]’s experience as a research subject, perceived reasons for consenting to be a research subject and perceived freedom to take part in the study.

Prospective participants will be prescreened by [CONTACT_194976]-approved script to learn if they meet basic eligibility criteria.   After telephone screening is completed, each potential participant will be given the informed consent form (ICF). The screening number will be used on all subject records prior to enrollment, including the ICF. After signing the ICF, participants will provide a medical and psychological history through interview and will undergo a general physical examination, performed by a physician who is not the Clinical Investigator.  The examination will involve the following procedures: Blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, body temperature, examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, heart, lungs, abdomen and extremities, brief neurological exam (cranial nerves 2-12, sensory, motor, reflexes and cerebellar function), ECG, clinical laboratory assessments to determine study eligibility (see Section 10.[ADDRESS_231396] of laboratory tests).  Tinnitus and chronic pain symptom severity will be collected using a visual analog scale in subjects with a medical history of these conditions. In addition, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and, if indicated, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) serology will be performed.  If there is a confirmed positive HIV serology, it will be kept confidential with the exception of reporting to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control as required by [CONTACT_2371], with the Department of Health informing the home state of any individual not residing in South Carolina. Likewise HCV serology will be kept confidential except for reporting to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control within seven days of discovery as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Appropriate referral for counseling and treatment will be made as necessary. The clinical laboratory values will not be captured in the Case Report Form (CRF), but will be used to establish eligibility and will be kept with the subject’s source record.  A urine-dip pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential and the drug screen will be performed as well.  If, upon examination, there are questions raised about possible medical problems, the investigators will request a review of participant medical records and request additional tests or assessments as indicated. If it is determined that the participant has Hepatitis C or well-controlled hypertension, further evaluation will be performed as described in Section 6.0.  A blinded independent rater who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions will administer the CAPS and assess the participant on the GAF. To establish independent rater reliability, the investigators will have the option to video record the screening CAPS interview in as many instances as necessary. The C-SSRS will also be

 administered at screening to assess suicide risk. Suicide risk will also be assessed via psychiatric interview. The Clinical investigator and independent rater will use medical records, communication with the participant’s treating psychiatrist or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194900]. The participant will complete the BDI-II, PTGI (in reference to time since the trauma), PSQI, DES-II and NEO-PI. The entire visit should take between 1.[ADDRESS_231398] over more than one day and up to four months prior to Visit 1 (enrollment). The participant may also have the first preparatory session (Visit 2) prior to enrollment.   If eligibility is confirmed, the participant will be enrolled and will be issued a subject number and contact[CONTACT_194977]-drug psychotherapy sessions and first experimental session.  Any participant who must discontinue a medication will, after consultation with the prescribing physician, be given a schedule to begin tapering off that medication so washout will be completed before the first experimental session, with the interval between the start of washout (the last day the medication was taken) and the first experimental session being at least five times the drug and active metabolites’ half-life, plus one week for stabilization. The first experimental session will be scheduled to occur after washout is complete, if applicable.  6.2.2 Preparatory Sessions (Visits 2-4) The investigator will inquire about any possible changes in the participant’s health to ensure that the subject continues to meet eligibility criteria and if applicable, will confirm that they have adhered to the schedule for tapering off medications.  In subjects who have pre-existing tinnitus or chronic pain, the visual analog scale will be used to collect the severity of symptoms.  The participant will undergo three 90-minute preparatory non-drug psychotherapy sessions with the investigators at their offices. During these sessions the investigators will gather more detailed history, answer any questions the participant may have, and work toward forming a strong therapeutic alliance. The participant and investigators will discuss goals for the MDMA sessions. They will review the procedures and therapeutic approach, following standard procedures and techniques discussed in the sponsor-developed treatment manual. The investigators will prepare the participant for the upcoming experimental sessions and promote an atmosphere of safety in which to confront traumatic experiences and powerful emotions.  Adherence criteria for preparatory sessions should be completed as a part of one of the three sessions. These elements do not have to be accomplished in any specific order or in every preparatory session. Generally, adherence criteria for these sessions include that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194901]-assisted psychotherapy. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194902] a strong working relationship with each other, and they will help the subject prepare for upcoming experimental sessions. Preparatory sessions will promote a safe set and setting for confronting trauma-related memories, emotions, and thoughts, which is intended to develop therapeutic alliance.   
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231399] preparatory session (Visit 2) may take place at the time of the screening and before enrollment. All eligible participants must be enrolled prior to the second preparatory session (Visit 3) and in maximum four months after the screening starts.  During the third and last introductory session the investigators will supply the participant with a set of instructions and restrictions for conduct [ADDRESS_231400] agree to take nothing by [CONTACT_120576]-free liquids after 12:00 A.M. (midnight) the evening before the MDMA session.  Participants must also refrain from the use of any psychoactive drug, with the exception of caffeine or nicotine, within [ADDRESS_231401].  All SAEs will be recorded from the time the participant is enrolled at Visit 1.   Adverse Events and medications will be collected as described in Sections 8 and 9 of the protocol.  6.2.3 MDMA Sessions [Visits 5, 9, and 14 (Visit 14 for full dose group only)]  Subjects in Stage [ADDRESS_231402] to be accomplished in any specific order. Generally, adherence criteria for these sessions include that the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194903] # MP8 [ADDRESS_231403]’s inner healing intelligence. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194904]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194905] a choice to encourage collaborative exploration if the subject repeatedly avoids trauma related material. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194906], in whatever way feels appropriate to the subject. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194907].   On the day of the MDMA session, the participant will arrive approximately one hour prior to the MDMA session.  Continuing eligibility will be confirmed, with confirmation of eligibility including a urine drug screening and, if appropriate, a urine pregnancy test.  If the subject continues to meet criteria and the participant reports that he/she followed appropriate rules and restrictions, the session will proceed; a positive pregnancy screen is cause for withdrawal from the protocol, a positive drug screen will be reviewed by [CONTACT_194978] a later time, rescheduling the session to a later date, or withdrawing the participant from the study. The sponsor and Clinical investigator will follow any pregnancy detected after the occurrence of an experimental session to outcome.  Before MDMA is administered, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194908]’s goals, intentions and concerns and some of the commonly experienced effects of MDMA. Participants will complete the SUD just prior to initial dose administration.  At approximately 10:00 A.M., participants will receive the initial dose of MDMA along with a glass of water.  The participant will sit or recline on comfortable furnishings, and there will be eyeshades and headphones if the participant wishes to use them.  They will listen to a program of music designed to support their experience by [CONTACT_194979] [99, 100]. They may also request periods of music if they wish. The investigators will also encourage periods of time in which the participant remains silent with eyes closed and with attention focused inward in order to allow for the further unfolding of their inner experience, in accordance with the principles of MAPS’ treatment manual [101].  Water and electrolyte containing fluids will be available ad lib throughout the session within the limits described in Appendix A.  Food will be available during the latter part of the session. The investigators may record the entire session to video and audio. Participants may receive a copy of audio or video recordings of at least one experimental session upon request. The participant will be encouraged to spend much of the time focusing attention on their inner experience without talking, but may speak to the investigators whenever they wish, and will receive guidance and support as needed.  After the first hour, if the participant has not spoken spontaneously, the investigators will check in with him/her about the nature of the experience. For the rest of the experience, as appropriate, the investigators will support and encourage the participant in emotional processing and resolution of whatever psychological material is emerging. 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231404] 16, 2013 
 Suicidality will be assessed with the C-SSRS twice during each experimental session (approximately one hour before and five to six hours after drug administration).  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured at the outset of the experimental session, once every [ADDRESS_231405] the option to print out the results during the session.  Participant body temperature will be measured via tympanic thermometer every 60-90 minutes. Participants will complete the SUD every 90 minutes, until the session is over, allowing a window of plus/minus [ADDRESS_231406] one of the investigators, or a physician who is covering for them if they are not available, will remain available to participants via 24-hour cellular telephone. 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231407]'s needs such as food and fluids during the overnight stay. The attendant will be an individual with previous training or experience in supporting individuals in psychological distress. The attendant may be anyone with some training or background in health care, particularly in psychiatric care. If there is an emergency or the participant needs additional support, the attendant can contact [CONTACT_473]. The participant and if applicable, his or her significant other, will also receive contact [CONTACT_194980]. Participants will be encouraged to use much of the time during their overnight stay for rest and for a period of reflection and integration in a quiet atmosphere.     Participants will be instructed not to use caffeine or nicotine for 6 hours after the dose of MDMA. Spontaneously reported reactions, Adverse Events and Medications will be collected as described in Section 8 and 9 of the protocol.  6.2.4 Integrative Sessions 24 Hours after Experimental Session [Visits 6, 10, 15 (15 for full dose group only)]  On the morning after the MDMA session, the participant will meet with both investigators during a 90-minute integrative psychotherapy session.   Adherence criteria for integrative sessions should be completed as a part of one of the three sessions following each experimental session. These elements do not have to be accomplished in any specific order or all in each and every integrative session. Generally, adherence criteria for these sessions include discussing material that emerged during experimental sessions and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_194909]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194910]. Subjects will be encouraged to relax and rest as much as possible for several days after the experimental session.  Participants will complete the C-SSRS during each integrative session. At the beginning of this session, the participant and both investigators conducting psychotherapy will indicate their beliefs concerning participant condition assignment. The participant and investigator will then discuss and review events, thoughts, feelings and memories that occurred during the experimental session. If necessary, the investigators will help the participant to reduce any residual psychological distress he or she may be experiencing. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194911], feelings of intimacy, and reduced fear that may have occurred during MDMA sessions and that may be applicable to emotionally distressing 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231408] will be for a brief check-in lasting 5 to 15 minutes, or as long as necessary to address any participant’s concerns or difficulties integrating their experience and to assess participant well-being. Additional telephone contact [CONTACT_194981]. On the second and seventh day of telephone contact, the C-SSRS will be administered to monitor for suicide risk.  Adverse Events and medications will be collected as described in Sections [ADDRESS_231409] deem it necessary. (See Time and Events Table). The purpose of these sessions is to 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231410] as much as possible for several days after the experimental session.  The investigators will use clinical judgment to assess the participant’s psychological well-being during this period of time. Suicidality will be assessed with the C-SSRS. Each integrative session may be recorded to audio and video, and participants may receive a copy of one or more integrative sessions upon request. If there are any indications of continuing anxiety or distress, the investigators may arrange to address it in a specially scheduled additional non-drug therapy session, through continuing telephone contact, or at the next regularly scheduled non-drug therapy session. The participant may also initiate contact [CONTACT_194982].   Adverse Events and medications will be collected as described in Sections [ADDRESS_231411], and spontaneously reported reactions will be recorded as reported during the session.   6.2.7 Evaluation at Primary Endpoint & Unblinding (Visit 13) The primary endpoint evaluation in Stage [ADDRESS_231412] of two meetings that may be completed on separate days, one with the independent rater and the other with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. The blinded independent rater will administer:  CAPS to assess PTSD symptoms, BDI-II to assess depression symptoms, GAF to assess general psychological function, PTGI to assess post-traumatic growth (in reference to start of the study), PSQI to assess sleep quality, DES-II to assess dissociation symptoms and NEO PI [INVESTIGATOR_194912].  The blinded independent rater will provide their belief of the subject’s condition assignment.    After completing all assessments and measures with the independent rater, the subject will meet with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194913] [ADDRESS_231413]’s condition assignment. The independent rater will remain blind to condition assignment at this time. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194914] C-SSRS. The visual analog scale will be used to collect

Participants who decline continuing to Stage 2 will complete the Responses to Research Participation Questionnaire (RRPQ). If participants had been assigned to the full dose condition in Stage I, they will provide their perceptions of experimental sessions at this point. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194915].   Adverse Events and medications will be collected as described in Sections [ADDRESS_231415] Experimental Session (Visit 18- Full dose subjects only, End of Stage 1) The final evaluation for full dose subjects in Stage [ADDRESS_231416] experimental session. Participants will meet the independent rater for 90 to 120 minutes. The independent rater will administer the CAPS, BDI-II, PTGI (in reference to the start of the study), DES-II and the PSQI. The independent rater will assess participants on the GAF. Administration of CAPS may be recorded to video.   After completing all assessments and measures at the evaluation at the end of Stage [ADDRESS_231417] if necessary.   6.2.9 Opportunity for Participants in Low Dose and Medium Dosage Condition to Enroll in Open-Label Study Segment ("Stage 2")  Low dose and medium dose participants who elect to enroll in Stage 2 will undergo a course of therapy and evaluation nearly identical to the full dose group in Stage 1, but given in an open-label context.  6.2.10 Open-Label Study Segment for Low Dose and Medium Dosage Participants (“Stage 2”) Participants assigned to receive low dose or medium dose MDMA during Stage 1 will undergo three open-label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions that follow a course and schedule similar to Stage 1 for the full dose group except that participants will 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231418], will decide whether to administer an initial dose of 100 mg or 125 mg initial dose of MDMA. If a 100mg initial dose of MDMA is selected, an optional supplemental dose of 50mg MDMA may be administered. If a 125mg initial dose of MDMA is selected, an optional supplemental dose of 62.5mg MDMA may be administered.  If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_194916]/or the optional clinical titration dose in a given experimental session, the unused capsules will be kept in their respective inner envelopes inside of the primary container in the safe.     Integrative sessions will be conducted according to procedures described in Sections 6.2.4 and 6.2.6. Phone calls will be conducted according to procedures described in Section 6.2.5.At the secondary endpoint based on procedures described in Section 6.2.7, the Independent Rater will administer the CAPS and GAF. Subjects will complete the BDI-II, PSQI, PTGI (in reference to the start of the study), and DES-II.Administration of the CAPS may be recorded to video.   Investigators will follow the most recent treatment manual in all matters relating to the Open-Label Stage [ADDRESS_231419] Open-Label Session (End of Stage 2)  All participants in Stage 2 will be assessed by [CONTACT_194983]-label session. At that visit, the independent rater will administer the CAPS, which may be recorded to video, and assess participants on the GAF, and participants will complete the BDI-II, PTGI (in reference to the start of the study), PSQI, DES-II, and NEO-PI. Participants will also complete C-SSRS and RRPQ with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Participants will provide their perception of the experimental sessions. Adverse Events and medications will be collected as described in Sections [ADDRESS_231420] changes in pre-existing tinnitus and chronic pain symptoms.

The independent rater will administer the CAPS and assess participants on GAF, and participants will complete the PTGI (in reference to the start of the study), BDI-II, PSQI, DES-II and NEO PI. Suicidality will be assessed with the C-SSRS. Participants will also complete a questionnaire assessing positive and negative long-term effects of the study. Outcome measures will either be completed over the telephone or at the study site.  A researcher who is a part of the study team may ask the subject questions about positive or negative effects about the study in person or on the phone and the participant will return self-report questionnaires in envelopes supplied by [CONTACT_194984]. The visual analog scale will be used to collect changes in subjects who have pre-existing tinnitus and chronic pain symptoms.   Subjects will complete the termination visit at this time.  Adverse Events and medications will be collected as described in Sections [ADDRESS_231422]’s source records and CRF.  Whenever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the primary endpoint and 12-Month Follow Up will be carried out.  Efforts will be made to obtain information about AE outcomes, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_473], Medical Monitor and/or Sponsor.  Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the primary endpoint will be replaced. Individuals who replace these subjects will be assigned the next available subject

The investigator will be provided with sealed emergency unblinding envelopes corresponding to each Enrollment Code.  These sealed envelopes will be stored in a secure limited access area and should remain sealed if there are no emergency unblinding events during the study. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], independent rater, and subject will remain blind to condition assignment until unblinding at the primary endpoint. Unblinding at the primary endpoint will be done using the web-based randomization program. Detailed instructions will be provided to the site in a separate document.   6.4 Premature Discontinuation of the Study The sponsor or the investigator (following consultation with the sponsor) has the right to discontinue this study at any time.  If the trial is prematurely terminated, the investigator is to promptly inform the study subjects and will arrange appropriate therapy and follow-up. If the study is prematurely discontinued, all procedures and requirements pertaining to the archiving of the documents will be observed. All other study materials will be returned to the sponsor and will be treated in accordance with federal and local regulations. Participants will still receive recordings of sessions if they request them.  7.[ADDRESS_231424] experience working with people with PTSD, and they will seek to reduce anxiety and distress during these interviews.  7.2 Risks and Discomforts Associated with Drawing Blood  Prior to enrollment, blood will be drawn as part of screening to assess eligibility.  Temporary discomfort may arise as a result of sampling blood.  Participants may experience temporary discomfort at the blood-draw site.  There is also a remote possibility of inflammation or infection at the blood-draw site.  
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231425] 16, 2013 
  7.3 Risks and Discomforts Associated with Non-Experimental and Experimental Psychotherapy During non-drug and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions, participants will be asked to think about and discuss their thoughts and emotions relating to the traumatic event or events.  They may experience intense emotional responses to recalling and speaking about this material.  Even in a therapeutic context, thinking about and discussing the trauma, symptoms related to the trauma or the effects of PTSD on life function can produce distress during and immediately after non-drug psychotherapy and experimental sessions.  Psychotherapy is conducted as part of the research study, including the experimental intervention (MDMA-assisted psychotherapy), and people undergoing psychotherapy are expected to confront unpleasant thoughts, feelings and memories in the process of therapy. Since psychotherapy is an integral part of the research study design, the potential distress arising from psychotherapy is unavoidable, and requires proper facilitation and support from the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Discontinuing PTSD medications and the acute and sub-acute effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can produce shifts in mood and activation, which may increase likelihood of suicidal ideation or behavior.  Participants may discuss emotionally distressing or embarrassing issues during their MDMA session.  This may cause psychological distress.  All psychotherapy sessions may be recorded to audio and video and participants may have access to recordings if they request them. Participants may feel uncomfortable with having their sessions recorded. The recordings will be used for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a manualized form of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to be used in future research. The recordings are necessary for developi[INVESTIGATOR_194917]. Participants will receive information on who will have access to any of their recordings and will have control over any presentation of this material beyond viewing by [CONTACT_431], trainees or regulatory agencies.  7.[ADDRESS_231426] generally not been associated with serious discomfort by [CONTACT_194985]-psychiatric or psychiatric populations. Spontaneously reported reactions may include anxiety, reduced appetite, dizziness, tight jaw or bruxism (tooth-grinding), difficulty concentrating, impaired gait or balance, dry mouth, and thirst. Other slightly less common reactions include drowsiness, impaired judgment, headache, restlessness, nausea, parasthesias (odd somatic feelings, such as tingling, feeling hot or cold), changes in thought, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], drowsiness, nystagmus (eye-wiggling) and sensitivity to cold.  These effects are transient and wane as drug effects wane. Sub-acute effects that may either continue for the next 24 hours or appear later include insomnia, fatigue, weakness, heavy legs, dry mouth, low mood or irritability. Other spontaneously reported reactions include increased private worries (rumination) and needing more sleep. Sub-acute effects are reported less often than acute effects.  Other common reactions in preliminary data from the initial study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD include muscle tension in approximately 20% and gastrointestinal discomfort or diarrhea in 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231427] 16, 2013 
 approximately 3.3% participants receiving MDMA. More information on drug side-effects is contained in the Investigator's Brochure (IB).   MDMA may produce mild alterations in sensory perception and altered perception of time [43, 60, 68].  Women may be more sensitive to these effects than men [62].  MDMA acutely affects attention, information processing and memory.  MDMA acutely impairs verbal memory and recall for object location without affecting recall of scene change [49].   7.4.1 Cardiovascular Effects The full dose of 125 mg, followed by a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg after 1.5 to 2.5 hours, is expected to produce significant but transient, self-limited increases in blood pressure and heart rate. Participants enrolled in controlled trials with MDMA (approximately 5% per trial) have had elevations in blood pressure of above 140/90 mmHg or higher, but none of these individuals needed clinical intervention and blood pressure returned to normal as drug effects waned [68, 75].  Table 2 shows the degree of increase in vital-sign measurements in the investigators’ recently completed clinical trial.  No subjects in other clinical trials using MDMA have required any clinical interventions for elevated blood pressure, pulse or temperature, and all values returned to normal spontaneously.   The degree of additional blood pressure and pulse elevation after a second dose of MDMA that is half the original dose and given 1.[ADDRESS_231428]. Michael Mithoefer, the Clinical Investigator who recently conducted a study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in 21 participants PTSD, demonstrates that elevation in blood pressure and heart rate after the supplemental dose does not exceed elevations seen after the initial dose.

 Group comparisons of vital signs were tested for change pre-session (15 minutes prior) to highest recorded and pre-session to post-session ([ADDRESS_231430]) using t-tests.  There was a significantly greater increase in all physiologic measures from pre-session to highest recorded value during experimental sessions for the MDMA group than for the placebo group (p < .05). There were no significant differences when comparing changes from  pre-session to post session (p>.05).  All values returned to pre-session norms by [CONTACT_194986].  7.4.[ADDRESS_231431] dissipated (approximately 3 to 5 hours after drug  administration).  Anxiety or distress during the session may last for as little as [ADDRESS_231432] volunteered for the sessions with the intention of confronting and working through traumatic experiences. Hence signs of psychological distress, anxiety, or other unpleasant psychological reactions are to be expected and may be considered an element of the psychotherapeutic process. Investigator responses to psychological distress are discussed in detail in Appendix A.  Less commonly, mild anxiety and depressed mood are reported 1–3 days after MDMA  administration [61, 62, and see the IB]. At least some of the physiological or psychological reactions listed above are very likely to occur. Proper preparation and follow-up support will reduce the impact of acute or sub-acute effects, so that participants are not likely to be unduly troubled by [CONTACT_476].  7.4.3 Body Temperature MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces only a slight increase in body  Temperature [62], and ambient temperature does not enhance or attenuate this slight  elevation in humans [44].  Maximum body temperature could rise above normal temperature, as with the maximum peak of 100° Fahrenheit (F), or 37.7 Celsius (C) during the first experimental session in the sponsor’s recent Phase 2 trial (n = 23, MDMA and placebo conditions combined), but body temperature returned to normal without treatment other than simply lowering the ambient temperature, which may or may not have been necessary.  7.4.[ADDRESS_231433] changes in immune functioning, lasting up to 48 hours. A research team in Spain has studied the acute immunological effects of one or two doses of 100 mg MDMA [102-104].  Findings included a decline in CD4 cells, smaller CD4/CD8 ratio, attenuated lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogen, and an increase in natural killer (NK) cells, with effects diminishing but still detectable 24 hours after drug administration.  These researchers also found that MDMA decreased 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231434] 16, 2013 
 production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 and interferon-Gamma and increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10.  Generally, MDMA appeared to decrease the concentration of Th1 (immunostimulating and pro-inflammatory) cytokines and increase the amount of Th2 (immunsuppressive and anti-inflammatory) cytokines measured in blood.  Research in rodents confirms these findings [105-107]. Changes of similar magnitude and duration have been previously noted after ingestion of other psychoactive agents, such as alcohol or cocaine [104, 108].  Because of their limited duration, these changes are not likely to have clinical significance beyond several days of possible increased risk of viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_194918].  Immunological changes seen after an initial dose of MDMA are enhanced by a second dose of identical size given four hours after the first dose [109, 110], and a second dose of identical size given [ADDRESS_231435] dose [110]. Given this data, it is possible that administering a smaller supplemental dose 1.[ADDRESS_231436] not reported any indication of increased risk of illness occurring after MDMA administration.  7.4.5 Abuse Liability MDMA was classified as a Schedule 1 compound in 1985, largely on the basis of its growing popularity at nightclubs and parties in the early to mid-1980s.  The DEA placed MDMA in Schedule 1, a category defined to include drugs with high abuse potential and no known medical use [111].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120508] a Schedule [ADDRESS_231437] that its abuse liability is high.  Rats, mice and monkeys will self-administer MDMA [112-114]. However, monkeys will “pay” higher prices in lever presses for psychostimulants than they will for MDMA [115, 116].  Studies assessing prevalence of problematic ecstasy use or dependence suggest that a small percentage of individuals, especially those with prior psychological difficulties, may develop ecstasy use or dependence [117, 118], though studies of non-representative samples have reported higher rates of dependence [119].  Most regular ecstasy users report taking ecstasy no more often than once a week [120].  Taken together, an examination of findings in humans and nonhuman animals suggests that MDMA possesses moderate abuse potential that is higher than that reported for “classic hallucinogens” like psilocybin, but lower than that reported for psychostimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine.  When reviewing the effects of MDMA in a sample of 74 largely drug-naïve participants, Liechti and colleagues stated that “none of the participants expressed any interest in taking MDMA as a recreational drug” after receiving MDMA in a controlled research setting, [62]. People with PTSD undergoing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy are likely to experience painful and frightening emotions during these sessions in conjunction with memories related to the original traumatic incident in addition to or even instead of increased positive mood or euphoria. As a result, it seems unlikely that people with PTSD undergoing this emotionally challenging experimental intervention will find the experience pleasurable or safe enough to pursue MDMA use in unsupervised and 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231438] been performed [121], and are included in the MDMA Drug Master File (DMF #6293).  Thus, the toxicity of MDMA is well characterized.  Serious MDMA toxicity is rare even in uncontrolled settings, considering the millions of users taking ecstasy of unknown identity, potency, and purity [122-124], with many users consuming estimated MDMA doses that are several times higher than those used in the proposed program, without any apparent toxicity.  Under unsupervised and nonmedical conditions, the most common SAE involves hyperthermia, described in Appendix A.  In addition to hyperthermic syndromes, other rare AEs include dysphoric, panic or psychotic response, hepatotoxicity and hyponatremia, and these are described in more detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.  The majority of ecstasy users visiting emergency departments do so because of anxiety or panic [125, 126]. In the proposed clinical protocol, study eligibility is intended to reduce the likelihood of many serious adverse events. Participants will be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of these events and will be offered supportive psychotherapy and other forms of support determined to be necessary by [CONTACT_120666].  Contingency plans for responding to these events are described in Appendix A.   7.4.7 Potential Neurotoxicity Associated with Ecstasy Use Extensive studies in animals indicate that high or repeated doses of MDMA can damage serotonergic axons originating in the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus, probably as a result of oxidative stress, and this damage is associated with decreases in serotonin, serotonin metabolites, and serotonin transporter site density [127-129], with a study in squirrel monkeys suggesting long-lasting effects on brain serotonin [130].  Similar changes can be induced by [CONTACT_194987] [131-133].  Previous studies in nonhuman primates overestimated human-equivalent doses [134], and previous studies in rodents may also have overestimated human-equivalent doses [135].  Studies in rodents and monkeys that employed lower or fewer doses of MDMA, or that involved self-administration, have failed to find some or all of the markers of serotonin neurotoxicity listed above [112, 136-138].  Some researchers believe that MDMA is neurotoxic in humans even at doses used in clinical trials [139].  However, they are basing their case on studies that employed inappropriately high doses of MDMA, and 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231439] 16, 2013 
 studies comparing the effects of repeated use of ecstasy, often along with other drugs, as discussed below.    There is controversy as to whether analogous changes in brain serotonin occur in humans, and a wealth of literature exists that compares ecstasy users to non-users [140].  Earlier studies were retrospective and possessed a number of methodological flaws, particularly in relation to appropriate matching of ecstasy users with controls.  Later research employed longitudinal study designs, allowing for comparisons over time.  Retrospective and longitudinal imaging studies have detected decreased estimated serotonin transporter (SERT) sites in current heavy ecstasy users when compared with controls [141-143], but with estimated SERT sites returning to normal or increasing in numbers with period of abstinence.  Likewise, studies have detected impaired memory and executive function in ecstasy users [140, 144, 145].  A number of these studies reported impaired cognitive function only in heavy users, and not in moderate users, and some recent studies suggest that use of other drugs may contribute to impaired cognition [146-149], though other studies also reported that abstinence from ecstasy did not attenuate memory impairment in heavy users [143, 150].   There is also some evidence that ecstasy users are more likely to report symptoms of anxiety or depression, and to exhibit more behavioral impulsivity than non-ecstasy user controls[151-154].  Findings from prospective and longitudinal studies suggest that young people with existing psychological problems are more likely to try ecstasy than people without these problems [117, 118], and it appears that polydrug use may contribute to this association [151, 155].  Findings from retrospective studies are of limited value in estimating the potential risk of neurotoxicity from two doses of MDMA, as average cumulative dose and frequency of use in most of these studies is considerably higher than doses in human trials of MDMA.  A better estimate of the potential risk of neurotoxicity can be found from prospective studies comparing people before and after their first use of ecstasy.    Starting in the early 2000s, a team of researchers in the Netherlands has examined  samples of people before and after reporting their first uses of ecstasy.  These researchers have assessed estimated SERT sites, chemical markers of neuronal injury, changes in cerebral blood flow, performance and brain activity related to a working memory task, and cognitive function in samples of ecstasy users reporting an average use of 1 to 3 tablets [156-159]. The team also performed studies expressly in heavy ecstasy users [160-163]. They failed to find reductions in SERT sites, signs of neuronal injury or changes in performance on or brain activity during a working memory task in samples reporting use of no more than six ecstasy tablets [156, 157].  They found slight changes in cerebral blood flow in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but nowhere else, and they failed to find any markers of neuronal injury [156].  Low use of ecstasy also failed to alter brain activity or performance on a measure of working memory [116].  When comparing cognitive function in people before and after their first use of an average of 3.2 tablets, with non-user controls at similar points in time, ecstasy users showed less improvement on a memory task than non-users [156].  It is notable that the study examining SERT sites and cerebral blood flow did not employ non-user controls, that all participants in the 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231440] 16, 2013 
 study of cognitive function performed within the normal range, and that one individual had reportedly used ecstasy on 30 occasions rather than the limit of 10 occasions set for the other studies.  Furthermore, there are some findings that women who decided to use ecstasy had higher impulsivity scores prior to use [164].  Taken together, their findings fail to confirm serotonergic neurotoxicity after low ecstasy use, yet found some possible indications of impaired memory.   The risks of neurotoxicity are minimal in the proposed protocol.  This is supported by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_194919].  Nevertheless, the risks of neurotoxicity arising from MDMA administration will be described and noted in application materials prior to and during the completion of the application, and the investigators will informally monitor for any signs of changes in cognition after each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session.  7.4.8 Reproductive and Developmental Risks Risks posed by [CONTACT_147989].  One of two studies of Ecstasy users suggests that use of Ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy may be associated with some abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this association, [165, 166]. A survey reported that in women interviewed on their drug use during pregnancy, there was a link between self-reported extent of prenatal MDMA exposure and delays in infant development at 12 months [167].  Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded from participation in the proposed protocol, and women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy screen before undergoing each experimental session and must agree to use birth control during the period of the protocol. If any participant becomes pregnant after the occurrence of at an experimental session, the sponsor and Clinical investigator will follow the pregnancy to outcome.  7.[ADDRESS_231441] emergency room.  The office will be equipped with a "crash cart" containing the  emergency drugs and equipment necessary to respond to any complications.  Intravenous fluids, antiarrhythmic drugs, antihypertensive drugs (such as nitroprusside and labetolol), injectable epi[INVESTIGATOR_194920], and other standard emergency drugs and equipment will be available on-site as a means of treating any potential allergic reactions or other medical emergencies. In addition to drugs, the crash cart will contain a defibrillator (with rhythm monitoring capability), an oxygen tank, a suction device, a pulse oxometer, an IVAC pump and intubation equipment (including laryngoscope, and endotracheal tubes).  As is now common practice in emergency departments, an automatic blood pressure cuff will be used in place of intraarterial blood pressure monitoring equipment. For a recently completed Phase [ADDRESS_231442] established (in communication with the FDA) contingency plans for responding to those AEs that appear most likely, based on a comprehensive review of case reports of toxicity in illicit MDMA users reported by [CONTACT_194988] 2001 and in the current Investigator’s Brochure.  The same contingency plans and equipment will be used in this protocol, with the exception of the fact that there will not be an additional nurse on site 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231443], the researchers will follow the American Heart Association guidelines for 2-person BLS for Healthcare Providers (including defibrillation with an automated external defibrillator (AED) until the arrival of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), at which time Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) procedures will be instituted. With these personnel and equipment, the researchers, in conjunction with EMS if necessary would be able to begin treatment in the office and then transport the participant by [CONTACT_147979][INVESTIGATOR_147919].  8.0 Adverse Events An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a clinical research study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants' involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research. This definition includes concurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.   An unexpected adverse event is one that is not listed in the current Investigator’s Brochure or an event that is by [CONTACT_29288] a listed event. All AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_194989], if the AE becomes chronic, a cause identified.  If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the protocol, a clinical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_1755]/or Medical Monitor as to whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted.  The severity of events reported on the “Adverse Events” CRF will be determined by [CONTACT_1694]:  ! Mild: No limitation in normal daily activity ! Moderate: Some limitation in normal daily activity ! Severe: Unable to perform normal daily activity  The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_194990]:  1. Not Related  The AE is not related if exposure to the investigational product has not occurred, or the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to use of the investigational product, i.e. there are no facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, or the AE is more likely related to the subject’s pre-existing condition.  2. Possibly Related  The administration of the investigational product and AE are considered reasonably  related in time and the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_194991] # MP8 [ADDRESS_231444] likely cause of the AE.  The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_093].  8.1 Common Expected Reactions Commonly expected reactions that are spontaneously reported are collected on a separate CRF page and will be categorized as mild, moderate or severe.  Spontaneously reported reactions may include reduced appetite, dizziness, tight jaw or bruxism (tooth-grinding), difficulty concentrating, impaired gait or balance, dry mouth, and thirst. Other slightly less common reactions include drowsiness, impaired judgment, headache, restlessness, nausea, parasthesias (odd somatic feelings, such as tingling, feeling hot or cold), changes in thought, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], drowsiness, nystagmus (eye-wiggling) and sensitivity to cold. These effects are transient and wane as drug effects wane. Sub-acute effects that may either continue for the next 24 hours or appear later include insomnia, fatigue, weakness, heavy legs, dry mouth, low mood or irritability. Sub-acute effects are reported less often than acute effects.  Other spontaneously reported reactions include increased private worries (rumination) and needing more sleep. Sub-acute effects are reported less often than acute effects. Other common reactions in preliminary data from the initial study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD include muscle tension in approximately 20% and gastrointestinal discomfort or diarrhea in approximately 3.3% participants receiving MDMA. Spontaneously reported reactions will be collected during the experimental session and during the seven days of telephone contact [CONTACT_194992].  8.[ADDRESS_231445] medical occurrence that at any dose:  • Results in death • Is life-threatening (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the event causes a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  • Is an important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life-  threatening or resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above

  AEs which do not fall into these categories are defined as non-serious.  It should be noted that a severe adverse event need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, by  [CONTACT_108], be severe.

 • Events related to planned treatments or physician visits for baseline conditions collected in the Medical History will not be collected unless there is an exacerbation of the condition. • Any AE leading to withdrawal from the protocol will be collected throughout the study. • All AEs related to changes in psychiatric status will be collected throughout the study.  A Memory aid card will be provided to the subject on the last visit prior to the [ADDRESS_231450] will be used to aid the subjects in providing information to the investigator. This information may be collected by [CONTACT_648].  9.0 Collection of Concomitant Medications and Tapering Instructions All medications, over the counter (OTC) and prescription will be collected from screening through 7 days after the final experimental session.  From 7 days after the final experimental session through study termination only medications taken to treat SAEs and psychiatric AEs will be collected.  Concomitant medications will be recorded during screening. Any psychoactive drugs will be tapered in an appropriate fashion to avoid withdrawal effects. They will be discontinued long enough before the experimental session to avoid the possibility of drug interactions (the interval will be at least 5 times the half-life of the particular drug or its active metabolites, plus one week for stabilization). If necessary, the investigators will make plans for tapering off and discontinuing any contraindicated medication upon enrollment, in consultation with the prescribing physician.    The investigators will request information about any changes in medication. Medications taken during the course of the protocol, including medications taken to treat AEs, will be recorded on a concomitant medications CRF.  Participants must be willing to refrain from taking any psychiatric medications until after the end of Stage 1 or Stage 2, with the exception of gabapentin when prescribed for pain control or stimulants for ADHD taken at baseline provided that they are discontinued 5 half lives before each MDMA session and are not restarted until 10 days after each MDMA administration. The investigators may prescribe a designated rescue medication in the event of symptoms that require it during or after the experimental session (e.g. insomnia or severe anxiety that does not respond to other management outlined in the treatment manual).    Subjects must be willing to refrain from taking any psychiatric medications during Stage [ADDRESS_231451] is on stimulants for ADHD at baseline, they can continue to use them at the same dose and frequency as long as they discontinue five half-lives before each experimental session and do not restart for 10 days after each experimental session.

In addition, HIV and, if indicated, Hepatitis C serology will be performed.    A urine-dip pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential and a urinary drug screen will be performed as well.   The laboratory assessments other than the urine drug screen and pregnancy test will be performed at:  Laboratory Corporation of America [ADDRESS_231456] will be performed at the study site. 11.0 Study Monitoring, Auditing and Documentation Investigators and/or their study staff will be trained prior to the start of the protocol.  The clinical study site will be monitored by [CONTACT_194994].  The site will be monitored as appropriate for the rate of enrollment in order to comply with GCP guidelines and to ensure validity of the study data. From the start of the study, videos from selected sessions will be reviewed for adherence to the Treatment Manual and therapeutic alliance. Adherence will be checked by [CONTACT_194995]. During each monitoring visit, source data verification will be performed by a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) to ensure compliance, including accurate and complete recording of data on CRFs, source documents, and drug accountability records.  A CRF collation supplied by [CONTACT_194996].   Monitoring and auditing procedures of the sponsor will be followed, in order to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and to ensure validity of the study data.  The sponsor will review the study documentation used for planning, conduct and

 monitoring of the study in order to ensure compliance with GCP and local regulations. This documentation includes as a minimum: the Investigator’s Brochure, the Study  Protocol, the Case Report Forms and the Subject Information and Consent Form.  During or after the clinical protocol, the regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or representatives of the sponsor may request access to all source documents, CRFs and other protocol documentation for on-site audit or inspection. 12.[ADDRESS_231458] sizes for all outcome measures for primary endpoint, Stage 1, secondary endpoint, end of Stage 2, and 12-month follow-up will be estimated using Cohen's techniques.   All analyses of data from the primary endpoint will contain blinded data. Analysis of variance will be used to compare Global CAPS scores by [CONTACT_194997]. Analysis of variance, or nonparametric analysis if assumptions are not met, will be used to compare the dose conditions for change in BDI-II, PTGI, PSQI, GAF, DES-II and NEO PI [INVESTIGATOR_194930]. If scores cannot be examined sufficiently in this model, then analyses will compare available data through the use of difference scores.   The sponsor will examine open-label data collected two months after the third Stage [ADDRESS_231459] analysis of full dose participants.  Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the primary endpoint will be asked to complete an outcome assessment prior to continuing to the long-term follow-up. The data from these subjects will be tested for equivalence to data from subjects completing the study per protocol. If found to be equivalent, data from these subjects will be presented as 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231460] Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale scores from any subject reporting tinnitus or chronic pain during each point of administration, including baseline, experimental and integrative sessions, the primary endpoint, and two-month follow-up. The sponsor will plot and examine all Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale scores across all three groups and within the dose groups for trends. Formal analysis of Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale scores will only occur if three or more subjects complete Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale at baseline and primary endpoint. Likewise, formal between-groups analyses will not be performed if all primary endpoint scores are from subjects assigned to the same condition. The sponsor will perform an independent t-test on the difference between baseline and primary endpoint Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale scores in the full dose and comparator dose conditions, with p. set at 0.05. If the only scores available are for subjects in a single condition, then a paired t-test will be performed comparing baseline and primary endpoint Changes in Tinnitus and/or Pain visual analog scale scores, with p. set at 0.05.    Descriptive statistics will be computed for SOCQ scores completed after each MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, and SOCQ scores will be compared across each of the three MDMA dose conditions and after full dose given during Stage 2. The data will be explored for effects of condition on responses to the SOCQ.   Descriptive statistics will be calculated for subject's perceptions of experimental sessions. Mean, standard deviation and range of individual responses will be examined. Perceptions of experimental sessions will be examined during Stage [ADDRESS_231461] in further development of adherence and competence measures. If sufficient data is available, the sponsor will correlate the mean adherence ratings for adherence scale and session type with Global CAPS scores to investigate the effects of adherence to the treatment manual on reduction in PTSD symptoms. If it is found that there are specific factors within the adherence scales, then the factor will be correlated with Global CAPS score.

The informed consent form (ICF) must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_194998]. The investigator will provide a copy of the signed ICF to the subject, and will maintain the original in the investigator’s study file.  The written ICF and any other written information to be provided to subjects should be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject's consent.  Any revised written ICF, and written information should receive approval from an IRB before use.  Written consent to take part in the study session includes giving the investigators permission to view the participant's recent medical records to assess protocol eligibility, if needed.  Information necessary for protocol participation includes past medical history, psychiatric interview, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.  The subject should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may affect the decision to take part in the MDMA session.  The communication of this information should be documented.

Any materials mailed to participants will be sent along with stamped return envelopes using the office address of the Clinical Investigator both as main and return address.  All assessment records will be kept in a locked file drawer or cabinet in a locked office, and access to measures will be limited to regulatory agencies, researchers, and individuals analyzing data.  Researchers, other than the investigators directly involved in the protocol, with access to data will not be provided with any information that would identify participants by [CONTACT_120651], such as social security number.   All psychotherapy sessions may be recorded to video and audio. These recordings will be used for manual development and potentially for training therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147912]-assisted psychotherapy. They are intended to record the events occurring during therapy, and will not serve as outcome measures. CAPS assessments may also be recorded to video to establish inter-rater reliability. Full names and addresses will not appear in these recordings.   Any use of recordings for purposes other than research or training (e.g. a documentary film) may occur only with separate written informed consent of the participant obtained after study participation is complete.    Maintaining data in a secure environment will prevent the accidental or deliberate examination or removal of data by [CONTACT_35532].  While it is possible that individuals may be identified on audiotape or video recording through means other than their names, restricting access to audio recordings or video recordings to researchers or trainees greatly reduces the risk of a breach of confidentiality.

 13.2 Costs to Participants  There will be no costs to the study participants for any study-related procedures.  The sponsor will cover all costs of study participation, including any assessments or tests performed solely for the purpose of establishing eligibility for participation.  Charges for treatment of the participant’s condition that are unrelated to the research study or any of its procedures will continue to be billed to the health insurance provider of the participant or to the participant him or herself.  It is anticipated that there will not be any charges for treatment that is unrelated to the study except in the case of participants who previously received therapy from the Clinical Investigator and who will continue to receive ongoing treatment that is not related to participating in the study.   13.[ADDRESS_231466] be billed to a participant’s health insurance provider.  The sponsor will cover any direct costs relating to the treatment of a study-related emergency that are not covered by a participant’s health insurance. Some study-related emergencies can be treated by [CONTACT_194999] “Medical Emergencies” (Section 7.5) and within Appendix A.

  Appendix A: Prevention and Response to Possible Serious Adverse Events Risk Mitigation  Information from a considerable body of research indicates that the likelihood of significant toxicity from the doses of MDMA used in a therapeutic setting is very low [43], see also the “Investigator’s Brochure.”  Psychiatrists in the U.S. and Europe reported administering MDMA to at least a thousand patients before the drug was made illegal without any drug-related SAEs occurring during sessions [36, 38, 59, 168, 169].  There have been no unexpected drug-related SAEs during the course of a study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD under the direction of the Clinical Investigator for the proposed protocol, nor in any other ongoing sponsor-supported study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD.    Although serious untoward reactions are unlikely, the researchers will closely and continuously monitor participants during an experimental session.  Throughout all sessions, participants will be attended by [CONTACT_473], a psychiatrist who is board-certified in internal medicine as well as psychiatry and who maintains ACLS certification, and a psychiatric nurse or licensed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194941] (BLS) certification.  The Clinical Investigator and assisting investigator will thus provide a team that is prepared to respond in the unlikely event of a medical emergency.  In the unlikely event of cardiac arrest, they will follow the American Heart Association guidelines for 2-person BLS for Healthcare Providers [including defibrillation with an automated external defibrillator (AED)] until the arrival of EMS, at which time ACLS procedures will be instituted.   The listed means of minimizing the likelihood of any of the SAEs that are reported to  occur in ecstasy users will be similar to the procedures and strategies employed in the  current study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD.  Psychological Distress Reports of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy conducted prior to the scheduling of MDMA indicate that some people receiving MDMA in a therapeutic context experienced periods of increased anxiety and even panic.  In the proposed study, participants will have the intention of confronting and working on their traumatic experiences and accepting and working through difficult and painful emotions.  Hence, signs of psychological distress, panic or other unpleasant psychological reactions are possible.  Psychological distress could arise at any time after the onset of the effects of MDMA until the last effects have dissipated (approximately 3 to 5 hours after drug administration), with anxiety or distress potentially lasting for as little as [ADDRESS_231485] that difficult emotions, including grief, rage and fear or panic, may arise during experimental sessions.  Every effort will be made to help participants resolve difficult symptoms and to arrive at a more comfortable and relaxed state by [CONTACT_148001], including empathic 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231486] 16, 2013 
 listening on the part of the investigators and performance of diaphragmatic breathing by [CONTACT_4317].  Risks will be reduced by [CONTACT_195003] (such as people diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder - 1 or with psychotic disorders), by [CONTACT_195004], by [CONTACT_195005], by [CONTACT_101219], by [CONTACT_147999] a week after the experimental session, and by [CONTACT_148000]-drug integrative psychotherapy sessions.  Subjects will remain in the offices of the Clinical Investigator for the evening and night immediately following each experimental session.  The study site will be staffed by a trained attendant to respond to the needs of the subject. The investigators will offer specialized training for all attendants to prepare them for being supportive but not intrusive as subjects rest and reflect on the day's experience. The attendant will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_195006] a potential adverse event.  The overnight stay in a private room in the study site and the presence of the attendant should further reduce psychological distress. There is also the possibility of psychological distress during the integration period following experimental sessions unrelated to direct effects of the experimental compound. Such distress occurs commonly in Prolonged Exposure, EMDR and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_57589].  At the end of the 6–8 hour experimental session, if the participant is still severely agitated or experiencing any other severe psychological distress, the following measures will be taken:  - If the participant is anxious, agitated, in danger of any self-harm or is suicidal at the end of the MDMA session, the investigators will remain with the participant for at least two more hours.  During this time, the investigators will employ affect management techniques, will talk with the participant to help them express their feelings or gain cognitive perspective of their experiences, and will help them implement the self- soothing and stress inoculation techniques presented during the introductory session.  If this situation should occur during an integrative therapy session, at least one of the investigators will be available to stay with the participant for at least two additional hours.  - If a participant remains severely anxious, agitated or in danger of self-harm or suicide, or is otherwise psychologically unstable at the end of this two-hour  stabilization period the Clinical Investigator will decide between one of two  options:  A.  A psychiatric nurse, therapeutic assistant or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194942].  The investigators will then meet with the subject daily until the period of destabilization has passed.  At any time during this process, the Clinical Investigator may make the clinical judgment to proceed to option B.  B. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194943].  
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231487] 16, 2013 
 Participants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] a severe panic reaction will be suspended from the protocol until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the investigator will carefully evaluate the participant’s emotional status.  The investigators will submit an SAE report to the IRB and the FDA in cases of drug-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  For those subjects engaged in an on-going therapeutic relationship with a psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_194944], the participant’s outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194945].    The investigators have developed a contingency plan for responding to suicidal intent. They will evaluate the degree of suicidal intent and take steps to alleviate psychological distress.   Seriousness of suicidal intent would first be evaluated by [CONTACT_195007] C-SSRS. Depending upon what is learned from evaluation, the investigator might increase support for and discussion with the participant, increase frequency of contact, or if during an experimental session, remain with the subject.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194946] A.   If the participant exhibits signs of suicidality the investigators will also call the contact [CONTACT_195008].  The investigators will use the same procedures for all participants. Increased telephone contact [CONTACT_195009] a viable option for a participant not within easy driving distance of the site. The treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194947].  In the event of a participant’s experiencing severe, persisting emotional distress, such as panic attacks, severe generalized anxiety or insomnia following an MDMA session, the investigator may prescribe a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_147936] a “rescue medication.”  This medication will be captured on a concomitant medications CRF page.   Residual symptoms will be addressed during the frequent follow-up psychotherapy visits with the investigators.    Means of monitoring for and preventing possible risks of MDMA other than the  cardiovascular risks and psychological distress are described in detail below.   Angina or Myocardial infarction  If a participant experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is associated with hypertensive crisis, he or she will receive oxygen and an IV and will be monitored as  described above.  He or she will be given [ADDRESS_231488] pain pending transport to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If further evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194948] (AMI), he or she will be well within the time frame required for definitive 
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231489] 16, 2013 
 therapy.  The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of AMI recommend percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) as the treatment of choice when it can be performed within [ADDRESS_231490] ECG evidence of AMI [170].  Stroke If any participant has neurologic deficits, whether or not they are associated with hypertensive crisis, he or she will receive oxygen and an IV and will be monitored as described above.  He or she will be transported to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a head CT scan and further management.   If evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147937] a non-hemorrhagic stroke, there will be time to administer recombinant tissue plasminogen within the 3 hour time frame recommended in the American Academy of Neurology/American Heart Association guidelines [171, 172].   Hyponatremia History of hyponatremia or detection of hyponatremia on initial laboratory examination will be cause for exclusion from the proposed protocol.  Participants will be given  primarily electrolyte solutions such as Gatorade instead of water in order to decrease the likelihood of dilutional hyponatremia.  They will not be allowed to drink more than 3 L. of fluids, and fluid intake will be appropriately spread out across the session.  If there are any signs or symptoms of hyponatremia, a stat serum sodium will be drawn and fluids will be withheld until the results are obtained.  If the serum sodium is less than 125mEq/L, serum and urine osmolality and sodium will be measured, and the subject will be transported to the East Cooper Medical Center, where further intervention can be  provided.   Hyperthermia Body temperature will be taken every 60 to 90 minutes throughout each experimental session.  If temperature rises more than 1° Celsius (C), attempts will be made to lower it by [CONTACT_120640], decreasing the ambient temperature and, if necessary, directing a fan toward the subject.  If at any time the temperature rises more than 1.5° C above baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], ice packs will be used, blood will be drawn for stat CBC, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, creatine phosphokinase  (CPK), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), platelets and liver  enzymes, and urine will be collected for urinalysis.  If there are significant abnormalities in these tests, if the temperature continues to rise, or if an elevated temperature is  associated with delirium or muscle rigidity the participant will be transferred to the intensive care unit at the East Cooper Medical Center.   
MAPS Study # MP8 [ADDRESS_231491] 16, 2013 
 Appendix B: Audio and Video Recording  Recording to video for psychotherapy sessions will be done with two cameras operated remotely by [CONTACT_195010]-drug psychotherapy sessions.  One camera will be adjusted to capture a fairly tight shot of the subject, including full-face shots and partial or full body shots.  The other will capture a wider view including the subject and the two investigators. Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_194949], one to be stored by [CONTACT_473], and the other by [CONTACT_456]. Both will be kept in secure locations. A third copy of video recording of any experimental or non-drug psychotherapy session can be made for any subject who requests it.    Participants will be asked to read a brief script for a computer program that will enable transcription of audio recordings. Audio recording of experimental and non-drug psychotherapy sessions will be done using a digital recording device controlled by [CONTACT_54858], with control allowing him to stop or start recording.  The recordings will be transferred to an external hard drive that will be kept in a locked cabinet. The recordings will then be burned onto CDs. One copy will be stored by [CONTACT_83196] a locked cabinet, another copy will be sent to the sponsor and will also be stored in a secure location. An additional audio recording can be made of any psychotherapy session.  The purpose of this is to enable the participants to have a recording for themselves at the end of each experimental session, rather than having to wait until the CDs are made by [CONTACT_473].  Part or all of these recordings may be viewed by [CONTACT_195011]-assisted psychotherapy for sponsor-supported studies.  Recording to video of CAPS assessment by [CONTACT_195012].  Full names and addresses will not appear in video or audio recordings. Facial images will not be removed from the copy of the video recording to be viewed by [CONTACT_195013].

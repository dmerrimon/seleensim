1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This phase  II placebo -controlled  study  will evaluate  the effect  of carvedilol,  compared  to placebo,  on 
anthracycline/anti -HER2  therapy  induced  left ventricular  dysfunction  in patients  with HER2 -positive  
breast  cancer  who are receiving  adjuvant  or neoadjuvant  therapy.   Upon  enrollment  and after 
providing  informed  consent,  a saliva  sample  will be obtained  by [CONTACT_206923]  06-107, and banked  
for future  correlative  gene  analysis.   All patients  (minimum  80 patients  to maximum  100 patients)  will 
undergo  routine  cardiac  surveillance  with 2D echocardiograms  per standard  of care at multiple  time 
points,  which  will align as closely  as possible  to the following:  pre-anthracycline  (baseline),  pre-anti- 
HER2  therapy,  and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months  (+/-  4 weeks)  after initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy.  In the 
case  that standard  of care echocardiograms  are not done  at these  time points,  either  due to a delay  
in anti-cancer  therapy  or due to the patient’s  medical  condition,  the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_206909].  Additional   speckle  tracking  strain  analysis  will be performed  on these  echocardiograms,  and 
blood  specimens  will be drawn  at several  time points  for biomarker  analysis.  
After completion  of anthracycline  treatment  and prior to initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy,  32 patients  
with abnormal  myocardial  strain,  defined  as global  longitudinal  strain  < 19% or % change  from 
baseline  by > 11%,  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to carvedilol  versus  placebo.   Carvedilol  will be 
administered  twice  daily for approximately  1 year OR until the end of anti-HER2  therapy,  if it is 
discontinued  prior to 1 year.   Treatment  in both carvedilol  and placebo  groups  will be systematically  
up-titrated  at weeks  3, 6, and 9 (+/- 1 week)  after randomization  to a goal dose  of 25mg  twice  daily.  
The primary  and secondary  outcome  measures  will be evaluated  at months  3, 6, 9, and 12 (+/- 4 
weeks).    In addition,  the prevalence  of subclinical  LV dysfunction  after completion  of anthracycline  
and anti-HER2  therapy  will be estimated.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Aims:  
 
Aim 1: To estimate  the prevalence  of subclinical  LV dysfunction  by [CONTACT_206924]-HER2  therapy  among  consecutive  women  scheduled  to receive  anthracycline  chemotherapy   
and anti-HER2  therapy  for HER2 -positive  early breast  cancer,  as defined  by [CONTACT_206925]  (< 19% or % change  from baseline  > 11%).   Study  participants  will be followed   
with serial  echocardiograms,  ordered  as per standard  of care,  with speckle  tracking  imaging  as close  
as possible  to the following  time points:  pre-anthracycline,  pre-anti-HER2  therapy,  and 3, 6, 9, and  
12 months  (+/- 4 weeks)  after the start of anti-HER2  therapy.  
Aim 2:  To generate  preliminary  evidence  of the effect  of prophylactic  treatment  with carvedilol  on 
anthracycline -anti-HER2  induced  changes  in LV systolic  function.   Patients  with abnormal  
myocardial  strain  at pre-anti-HER2  therapy  imaging  will be randomized  to carvedilol  vs placebo  
starting  at a dose  of 3.125mg  twice a  day and up titrated  to a maximal  dose  of 25mg  twice  a day. 
Hypothesis:   Prophylactic  treatment  with carvedilol  can prevent  the development  of anthracycline - 
anti-HER2  associated  LV systolic  dysfunction.  
Secondary  Aims:  
 
Aim 3:  To explore  the effect  of prophylactic  carvedilol  on  indices  of LV function  and the incidence  
of anti-HER2  therapy  interruption.  
Exploratory  Aims : 
1. To collect  and bank specimens  for future  use in evaluating  the association  between  
echocardiographic  markers  of systolic  function,  specifically  myocardial  strain  imaging,  
with cardiac  biomarkers  of cardiac  injury  and remodeling  (troponin -I) and inflammation  
and candidate  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms.  
2. To explore  the effect  of prophylactic  carvedilol  treatment  on local or distant  breast  cancer  
recurrence,  development  of second  primary  cancers,  and all-cause  death.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_246794]  Cancer:  
 
Breast  cancer  is the most  commonly  diagnosed  cancer  in women,  and the 2nd  leading  cause  of 
cancer  death  in women—an estimated  232,[ADDRESS_246795]  cancer  will be 
diagnosed  this year.[ 1]  However,  earlier  detection  and improved  treatment  have resulted  in steadily  
decreasing  rates  of breast  cancer  related  death.   Women  surviving  breast  cancer  represent  22% of 
all cancer  survivors  U.S.,[ 2, 3] with more  than 2.[ADDRESS_246796]  cancer  survivors  estimated  in the 
U.S. today.[ 4]  The human  epi[INVESTIGATOR_61983]  2 (HER2)  oncogene  encodes  a 
transmembrane  tyrosine  kinase  receptor  that is critical  for cell growth  and survival.   HER2  is over- 
expressed  or amplified  in 20-30% of invasive  breast  cancers  and is associated  with poor 
prognosis. [5, 6]  Trastuzumab  (Herceptin)  is a humanized  monoclonal  antibody  against  the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -099 A(9)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_246797]  cancer  recurrence  by 40- 
50% in several  landmark  clinical  trials. [7-9]  Since  that time,  trastuzumab  therapy  has become  the 
standard  of care among  patients  with HER2 -positive  breast  cancer  and is used  mostly  in 
combination  with adjuvant   chemotherapy.  
 
3.2. Treatment  Associated  Cardiotoxicity:  
 
The benefit  of trastuzumab  therapy  is substantial  although  there  is a small  risk of trastuzumab  
associated  cardiotoxicity.   The concern  over cardiac  safety  of trastuzumab  was first raised  during  
early clinical  trials of patients  with metastatic  disease,  in which  increased  rates  of cardiac  
dysfunction  were  unexpectedly  observed  in 27% of patients  receiving  anthracycline  based  
chemotherapy  plus trastuzumab  compared  to 3-8% among  patients  receiving  trastuzumab  or 
anthracyclines  alone.[ 10]  Subsequent  trials of trastuzumab  therapy  in the adjuvant  setting  have 
shown  fewer  cardiac  events.   In the joint analysis  of the National  Surgical  Adjuvant  Breast  and 
Bowel  (NSABP)  B-31 and North  Central  Cancer  Treatment  Group  (NCCTG)  N9831  trials,  the 
cardiac  event  rate (defined  by [CONTACT_206926])  was < 4% among  the 
trastuzumab  treated  group.[ 11] 
Although  the risk of symptomatic  CHF is low in the adjuvant  setting,  milder  forms  of cardiac  
dysfunction  are more  common.  In the HERA  trial 9.8%  of patients  treated  with trastuzumab  
compared  to 2.9%  in the control  group  had at least one significant  decline  in LVEF  (defined  as a 
decrease  of >10%  from baseline  to below  50%). [12]  Asymptomatic  declines  in LVEF  led to 
discontinuation  of trastuzumab  in 14% of patients  in NSABP  B-31.[13]  However,  in clinical  practice,  
the incidence  of significant  asymptomatic  LVEF  decline  is higher  (17% -23%). [14-16]  As a result  of 
these  studies,  an intensive  cardiac  surveillance  program  was mandated  in order  to detect  signs  of 
treatment  associated  cardiotoxicity.   LVEF  assessment  is performed  most  commonly  by 
[CONTACT_206927]  [ADDRESS_246798]  to anthracycline  mediated  cardiotoxicity,  is 
generally  considered  to be reversible  after discontinuation  of trastuzumab.   It occurs  in a minority  of 
patients,  is not dose  related,  and shows  no identifiable  abnormalities  on endomyocardial  biopsy. [17] 
An early study  by [CONTACT_206928], among  38 patients  with trastuzumab -associated  
cardiotoxicity,  LVEF  improved  in 37 patients  with no evidence  of ultrastructural  changes  on 
myocardial  biopsy  in 9 of these  patients. [18]  However,  this concept  of reversibility  has recently  been  
challenged  in the 7 year follow -up from the NSABP  B-31 study,  in which  36 of 147 patients  who 
discontinued  trastuzumab  for cardiac -related  reasons  had a LVEF  < 50%.[ 11]  The irreversibility  in 
these  patients  is likely due to the anthracycline  chemotherapy,  but it is unclear  on the contribution  
from trastuzumab.   The exact  mechanism  of trastuzumab -induced  cardiotoxicity  has yet to be 
elucidated;  however  several  hypotheses  have been  proposed.   HER2/neu  (also  known  as ERBB2)  is 
known  to be required  for cardiac  development  and is a critical  component  of the stress  response  of 
the heart.   In mice,  inactivation  of ERBB2  was shown  to result  in failure  of ventricular  trabeculation  
during  midgestation.[ 19]  A study  by [CONTACT_206929]2  leads  to 
mitochondrial  dysfunction  and activates  the mitochondrial  apoptosis  pathway.[ 20]  Ventricle  restricted  
ERBB2  knockout  mice  displayed  features  of dilated  cardiomyopathy  and were  more

sensitive  to biomechanical  stress  of volume  overload  and anthracycline  therapy.[ 21]  In clinical  
practice,  the risk of trastuzumab  cardiotoxicity  is most  relevant  among  patients  with prior treatment  
with anthracycline  based  chemotherapy.   This may suggest  a two-hit model  in which  anthracycline  
exposure  first induces  cellular  injury  through  free radical  production.   When  faced  with the loss of 
HER2/neu  signaling  during  trastuzumab  therapy,  cardiomyocytes  are more  susceptible  to the 
adverse  effects  of cardiac  stressors  and at increased  risk for further  cardiac  injury.  
 
3.4. Oncologic  and Cardiac  Implications  of Trastuzumab  Cardiotoxicity:  
 
Although  trastuzumab  therapy  is commonly  interrupted  or discontinued  in 15-25% of patients  when  
there  is evidence  of changes  in cardiac  function,  the impact  of this practice  on breast  cancer  
outcomes  is unknown.   Asymptomatic  LV dysfunction  is a significantly  more  common  adverse  event  
than symptomatic  heart  failure,  and LV dysfunction  can persist  in some  patients  despi[INVESTIGATOR_206910].   Currently,  no data is available  on the association  between  treatment - 
induced  asymptomatic  LVEF  decline  and subsequent  development  of cardiac  events  (i.e. CHF or 
cardiac  death),  and longer  prospective  follow -up is needed  to further  investigate  this.  Based  on long 
term follow -up from the Framingham  Heart  Study,  it has been  shown  that patients  with  
asymptomatic  LV dysfunction  (ALVD)  are at high risk of CHF and death,  even when  only mild 
impairment  of EF is present.[ 22]  Rates  of CHF among  subjects  with normal  LV function  and ALVD  
were  0.7 and 5.8 per 100 person  years,  respectively.    Mild ALVD  (EF 40% to 50%)  was associated  
with a hazards  ratio for CHF of 3.[ADDRESS_246799]  Cancer  Outcome  
 
Trastuzumab  therapy  can be interrupted  or permanently  discontinued  for a significant  decrease  in  
left ventricular  function;  however  the impact  of this practice  on breast  cancer  outcomes  has never  
been  studied  prospectively.   To investigate  this question  further,  we conducted  a retrospective   
cohort  study  to assess  the incidence  of trastuzumab  interruption  in clinical  practice  and evaluate  the 
effect  of trastuzumab  cardiotoxicity  and subsequent  trastuzumab  interruption  on breast  cancer  
outcomes.   Among  [ADDRESS_246800]  cancer,  85 patients  (14.9%)  had 
trastuzumab  treatment  interrupted,  and treatment  associated  cardiotoxicity  was the most  common  
reason  for interruption.  Patients  in the interrupted  group  had a higher  BMI (28.5  vs 26.8,  p =0.027)  
and more  had estrogen  receptor -negative  (49.4%  vs 31.7%,  p=0.001)  and progesterone  receptor - 
negative  (59.8%  vs 45.8%,  p=0.016)  disease.  In terms  of disease -free survival,  the hazard  ratio for a 
first event  in the interrupted  group,  compared  to the continuous  group,  was 2.58 (95 percent  
confidence  interval,  1.848  to 7.059;  p<0.001).   Among  patients  with trastuzumab  interruption  due to 
trastuzumab  cardiotoxicity,  the hazard  ratio for a disease  free survival  event  was 2.37 (95 percent  
confidence  interval,  1.45-7.56,  p=0.004 ).[23]   Patients  in the interrupted  group  had poorer  prognostic  
features  and this could  have accounted  for more  DFS events.  However,  as this was a retrospective  
study,  no definitive  conclusion  can be made  on the association  between  trastuzumab  interruption   
and breast  cancer  outcomes.   Additional  prospective  data are needed.  
 
3.6. ACE-inhibitors  and Beta Blockers  May Reduce  Trastuzumab  Associated  Cardiotoxicity:  
Cardinale  et al performed  a prospective  randomized  trial to study  the effect  of enalapril  treatment  on 
the prevention  of cardiotoxicity  among  high risk patients  receiving  high dose  chemotherapy,  and 
showed  that 43% of control  and 0% in the enalapril  group  had >10%  drop in LVEF. [24]  In a study of 
patients  receiving  anthracycline  based  chemotherapy,  patients  randomized  to carvedilol  12.5mg

daily showed  no change  in LVEF  after chemotherapy  compared  to the placebo  group,  in which  there  
was an absolute  reduction  in LVEF  by 17%.[ 25]  Seicean  et al retrospectively  analyzed  data of 
patients  receiving  anthracycline  and/or  trastuzumab for breast  cancer  and observed  that use of BBs 
was associated  with a lower  incidence  of heart  failure.[ 26]  These  studies  suggest  that ACE-I and 
BBs may effectively  reduce  the risk of trastuzumab -associated  cardiotoxicity.  
3.7. Speckle  Tracking  Strain  Echocardiography  for Early  Detection  of Cardiotoxicity  
Speckle  tracking  strain  imaging  is a new echocardiographic  modality  that measures  myocardial  
deformation  and provides  a more  sensitive  and quantitative  assessment  of cardiac  contractile  
function  than conventional  2D echocardiographic  indices. [27, 28]  Strain  is a highly  reproducible  and 
objective  measurement  that is superior  to EF or fractional  shortening  in the detection  of early 
subclinical  myocardial  dysfunction  and has been  shown  to be useful  in the early diagnosis  of 
trastuzumab  associated  cardiotoxicity.[ 29, 30]  In a prospective  multicenter  study  by [CONTACT_206930], 
global  longitudinal  strain  < 19% was predictive  of subsequent  development  of cardiotoxicity  and 
present  in all patients  who later developed  symptoms of heart  failure.[ 30]  A study  by [CONTACT_206931] 11% reduction  in global  longitudinal  strain  was predictive  of subsequent  
trastuzumab  associated  cardiotoxicity.[ 31] 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
A prospective  observational  cohort  study  design  will be used  to determine  the prevalence  of 
subclinical  LV dysfunction  by 1 year from the start of anti-HER2  therapy,  as defined  by [CONTACT_206932]  < 19% or % reduction  in global  longitudinal  strain  by > 11% from baseline.   All 
patients  with HER2 -positive  early breast  cancer  and treated  with anthracycline  plus anti-HER2  
therapy  will be eligible  for this study,  and serial  echocardiograms  will be performed  with additional  
speckle  tracking  strain  analysis  throughout  the duration  of therapy.    The minimum  planned  accrual  
for this study  is 80 patients,  and enrollment  will continue  to a maximum  of 100 patients  to allow  for 
randomization  of 32 patients  in the treatment  arm. 
After completion  of anthracycline  based  chemotherapy  and prior to initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy,  
study  participants  will undergo  a repeat  routine  transthoracic  echocardiogram.   Thirty -two patients  
with abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  (< 19% or a relative  decrease  in global  longitudinal  strain  by 
> 11% from baseline)  and who do not meet  any exclusion  criteria  (outlined  in section  9.0) will be 
randomized  in a 1:[ADDRESS_246801] day of anti-HER2  therapy  (+/- 1 week),  and administered  twice  
daily for the duration  of the study  period  (approximately  1 year,  or sooner  if anti-HER2  therapy  is 
discontinued  prematurely).   Routine  serial  echocardiograms  with speckle  tracking  strain  analysis  will 
be performed  for the duration  of therapy.   Patients  with normal  global  longitudinal  strain  at the end of 
anthracycline  chemotherapy  will be followed  observationally  and undergo  routine  serial  
echocardiograms  with speckle  tracking  strain  analysis  until 1 year after anti-HER2  therapy  is  
initiated.  
All patients  will undergo  biomarker  testing  as outlined  in the study  calendar  in section  10.0,  and all 
patients  not previously  registered  to protocol  06-107 will be approached  with the consent  and option  
for banking  of an Oragene  sputum  specimen  for future  DNA analysis  at the time of enrollment.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -099 A(9)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_246802]  of care time points,  as previously  
described.   We will perform  additional  speckle  tracking  strain  analysis  on all echocardiograms  using  
these  clinically  indicated  echocardiograms.   A sputum  specimen  will be collected  and banked  from  
all  study  participants  for future  correlative  studies.  In addition,  blood  specimens  will be collected  for 
biomarker  testing  in tandem  with anti-HER2  therapy  administration  and as close  as possible  to the 
following  time points:  baseline,  pre-anti-HER2  therapy,  and at 3 and 6 months  (+/- 4 weeks).  If anti- 
HER2  therapy  is interrupted  or delayed  for any reason,  blood  specimens  for biomarker  testing  will be 
collected  once  treatment  resumes.  Should  anti-HER2  therapy  be interrupted  for a significant  length   
of time,  it will be at the principal  investigator’s  discretion  whether  to “skip”  any given  time point (for 
example,  if there  is a shorter  window  of time between  the 3 month  and 6 month  time points  due to a 
treatment  delay.)  All echocardiograms  will be read by a core lab with readers  blinded  to treatment  
allocation.   For strain  analysis,  a non-sequential  test ID will be assigned  for each  examination,  
identifiers  and clinical  information  removed,  and all will be interpreted  by a single  echocardiographer  
masked  to treatment  allocation,  2D echocardiogram  results,  and prior strain  analyses.   The clinical  
treatment  team  will have access  to results  of routine  2D-echocardiogram  measurements  only (per 
standard  of care).  
A total of 32 patients  eligible  for Aim 2 will be randomized  in a 1:1 fashion  to carvedilol  versus  
placebo  as follows.   After completion  of anthracycline  based  chemotherapy  and prior to initiation  of 
anti-HER2  therapy,  study  participants  will undergo  a repeat  routine  transthoracic  echocardiogram.  
Patients  with abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  (< 19% or a relative  decrease  in global  longitudinal  
strain  by > 11% from baseline)  who do not meet  any exclusion  criteria  (outlined  in section  9.0) will be 
randomized  in a 1:[ADDRESS_246803] day (+/- 1 week)  of anti-HER2  therapy,  and administered  twice  
daily for the duration  of the study  period  (approximately  1 year,  or sooner  if anti-HER2  therapy  is 
discontinued  prematurely).  
The following  parameters  for carvedilol  dosing  will serve  as a guide  for the protocol.  The investigator  
may opt for different  carvedilol  management  at his or her discretion.   Carvedilol  will be started  at an 
initial  dose  of 3.125mg  twice  a day to a target  dose  of 25mg  twice  a day, and treatment  in both the 
carvedilol  and control  groups  will be systematically  up-titrated  at weeks  3, 6, and 9 (+/- 1 week)  after 
clinical  assessment  by a cardiology  investigator.   Criteria  for up-titration  are described  in section  9.0. 
All dosages  will be labeled  by [CONTACT_180196] (1, 2, 3, or 4) and will be otherwise  identical  in appearance.  
 
Dose  level 1 3.125mg  oral twice  daily

to assess  for adverse  medication  effects  and symptoms  of congestive  heart  failure.   Patients  will 
continue  with all preplanned  cardiac  evaluations  irrespective  of anti-HER2  interruption.  
4.4 Future  Use of Samples  
 
Sputum  samples  (Oragene -DNA kit, DNA Genotek,  Kanata,  Ontario,  Canada)  will be collected  and 
banked  at room  temperature  and stored  at the Breast  and Imaging  Center  for future  correlative  
studies  to evaluate  the association  between  anthracycline -anti-HER2  associated  changes  in 
myocardial  function  and candidate  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (i.e. HER2  polymorphisms  
IIe655Val  and Ala1170Pro  and polymorphisms  of carbonyl  reductase  CBPR1  and CBPR3 ).  This 
biospecimen  collection  will be performed  under  protocol  #06-107.  Any projects  outside  of the scope  
of this protocol  will need  to be approved  by [CONTACT_1201]/PB.  An Biospecimen  Research  Protocoldetailing  
the proposed  project  will need  to be approved  by [CONTACT_1201]/PB  prior to the start of the project.  
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  
 
Commercially  available  carvedilol/placebo  is provided  by [CONTACT_206933].   The medication  will be dispensed  at the beginning  of each  treatment  cycle  and 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_206911].   Carvedilol  and placebo  will be supplied  in bottles  
containing  a 4 week  (for titration)  or 12 week  (maintenance)  supply.   Carvedilol  and placebo  should  
be stored  at room  temperature,  not above  25°C  (77°F).   Both carvedilol  and placebo  will be 
dispensed  in capsules  of uniform  shape  and color,  and the packaging  will be identical.

adjuvant/neoadjuvant   therapy.   The patient  will be seen  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yu or [CONTACT_32830] (or other  members  of  
the Cardiology  Service)  timely  for eligibility  and will discuss the study  and the possibility  of  
enrollment  in the research  study  with the patient.  Minorities  and women  are well represented  in the 
breast  cancer  medicine  clinics,  and we expect  that they will be well represented  in the trial accrual.  
The principal  investigator,  [CONTACT_20266], will be available  to all patients  for further  questions  and  
information  through  a contact  [CONTACT_206934].   Given  the annual  
estimate  of ~[ADDRESS_246808]  information  in order  to approach  these  patients  
regarding  the possibility  of enrolling  in the study.  Such  patients  are already  contained  in institutional  
databases  and are part of the sampling  frame.   During  the initial  conversation  between  the 
investigator/research  staff and the patient,  the patient  may be asked  to provide  certain  health  
information  that is necessary  for the recruitment  and enrollment  process.  The investigator/research  
staff may also review  portions  of their medical  records  at MSKCC  in order  to further  assess  
eligibility.  They  will use the information  provided  by [CONTACT_17491]/or  medical  record  to confirm  that 
the patient  is eligible  and to contact  [CONTACT_46443].  If the patient  turns  out to 
be ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will destroy  all information  collected  on the 
patient  during  the initial  conversation  and medical  records  review,  except  for any information  that 
must  be maintained  for screening  log purposes.  
8.1 PRETREATMENT  EVALUATION  
 
All aspects  of the screening  evaluation  should  be completed  within  four weeks  of starting  treatment  
unless  otherwise  noted.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
There  are two components  of this study.   For Aim 1, a prospective  cohort  study  design  will be used  
to determine  the prevalence  of subclinical  LV dysfunction,  as defined  by [CONTACT_206937]  
<19%  or % reduction  by >11% from baseline,  among  all patients  diagnosed  with HER2 -positive  
early breast  cancer  and treated  with anthracycline  based  chemotherapy  plus anti-HER2  therapy.  
These  patients  will undergo  routine  serial  LVEF  assessments  by 2D echocardiography,  per standard  
of care,  as previously  described..  
Conventional  2-dimensional  and Doppler  echocardiography  will be performed  using  a commercially  
available  standard  ultrasound  scanner  (E9, GE Medical  Systems,  Horten,  Norway).   All 
echocardiograms  will be performed  by a registered  diagnostic  cardiac  sonographer  according  to a 
standardized  protocol.   Chamber  quantification  and other  standard  hemodynamic  variables  will be 
obtained  according  to the American  Society  of Echocardiography  (ASE)  guidelines.[ 32]   Diastolic  
function  will be assessed  using  pulsed  wave  Doppler  and tissue  Doppler  imaging.  
During  the standard  2D echocardiogram,  three  api[INVESTIGATOR_206912] (at least 80 frames  per second)  to allow  for offline  speckle  tracking  strain  analysis  (Echopac,  GE 
Medical  Systems).  This analysis  will be performed  independent  of the clinical  interpretation  of the  
2D echocardiogram.   The methods  of image  acquisition  and strain  measurements  with speckle  
tracking  have been  previously  described. [33]  Briefly,  after initial  automated  tracking  of the 
endocardial  border  and software  processing,  manual  correction  will be performed  to ensure   
adequate  tissue  tracking  as needed.   Each  view will be divided  into [ADDRESS_246809] access  
to results  of routine  2D-echocardiogram  measurements  only (per standard  of care).  
If the patient  had an echocardiogram  or multi-gated  acquisition  scan  done  locally  before  enrolling  
onto the study,  the patient  will be asked  to have another  baseline  echocardiogram  with strain  
imaging,  which  will not be charged  to the patient.  This will be covered  by [CONTACT_206938].  
A double  blind randomized  placebo  controlled  study  design  will be used  to accomplish  the goals  of 
Aim 2 (Fig 1).  After completion  of anthracycline  based  chemotherapy  and prior to initiation  of anti- 
HER2  therapy,  study  participants  from Aim 1 with abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  (< 19% or a 
relative  decrease  in global  longitudinal  strain  by > 11% from baseline)  will be eligible  for this study.  
Patients  in the observational  group  who develop  abnormal  strain  after initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy  
will not be eligibile  for randomization.

Prior to initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy,  patients  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to receive  carvedilol  
versus  placebo  through  the MSKCC  Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  system  (see section  
15.2).   Study  drug will be started  on the first day of anti-HER2  therapy  (+/- 1 week),  and 
administered  twice  daily for the duration  of the study  period  (approximately  1 year,  or sooner  if anti- 
HER2  therapy  is discontinued  prematurely).  
Commercially  available  carvedilol  and placebo  will be provided  by [CONTACT_206939].   Study  drug will be prepared  by [CONTACT_206940] (Core  Manager:  
Mark G. Klang,  MS, RPh,  BCNSP,  PhD).  
Dosing: 
 
Carvedilol  will be started  at an initial  dose  of 3.125mg  twice  a day to a target  dose  of 25mg  twice  a 
day, and treatment  in both the carvedilol  and control  groups  will be systematically  up-titrated  at 
weeks  3, 6, and 9 (+/- 1 week)  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_206913].  Criteria  for up- 
titration  will include  the following:  heart  rate > 50 beats  per minute,  systolic  blood  pressure  > 90 
mmHg,  and absence  of dose -limiting  symptoms  suggestive  of medication  intolerance  including  
dizziness,  fatigue,  or weakness.   Toxicity  will be graded  according  to NCI CTCAE,  version  4.0.  All 
capsules  will be labeled  by [CONTACT_180196] (1, 2, 3, or 4) and will be otherwise  identical  in appearance.  If 
a DLT is observed  at dose  level 1, patients  will come  off study.  
 
Dose  level 1 3.125mg  oral twice  daily 
Dose  level 2 6.25mg  oral twice  daily 
Dose  level 3 12.5mg  oral twice  daily 
Dose  level 4 25mg  oral twice  daily 
 
 
Treatment  will be continued  until the completion  of the 1 year course  of anti-HER2  therapy  or earlier  
if anti-HER2  therapy  is prematurely  discontinued.  2D echocardiograms  with strain  analysis  will be 
performed  in all enrolled  patients  for the duration  of the study  period  as described  in Aim 1, 
irrespective  of treatment  interruption.

Figure  1 – Study  Design  
 
For the exploratory  aim, blood  specimens  will be collected  for biomarker  analysis  at baseline  prior to 
anthracycline  treatment  as well as pre- and post- anti-HER2  infusion  at approximately  month  0, 3, 
and 6, per the study design  outlined  in Fig. 1. ). If anti-HER2  therapy  is interrupted  or delayed  for  
any reason,  blood  specimens  for biomarker  testing  will be collected  once  treatment  resumes.  
Leftover  blood  samples  will be stored  for additional  biomarker  analysis  (to be determined),  including  
but not limited  to ultrasensitive  troponin -I which  we anticipate  will be FDA approved  and available  for 
clinical  use in the next year and circulating  markers  of cardiac  inflammation.   Study  participants  will 
also be asked  to provide  an optional  saliva  sample  for DNA extraction  and future  study  under  
protocol  #06-107.  Specimens  will be assigned  a unique  identification  code  that is independent  of  
the patient’s  medical  record  number  to protect  the confidentiality  of the patient,  while  still facilitating  
subsequent  correlation  with clinical  data.  DNA extraction  kits ((Oragene -DNA kit, DNA Genotek,  
Kanata,  Ontario,  Canada)  will be stored  at room  temperature  for future  correlative  studies  to  
evaluate  the association  between  anthracycline -anti-HER2  associated  changes  in myocardial  
function  and candidate  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (i.e. HER2  polymorphisms  IIe655Val  and 
Ala1170Pro  and polymorphisms  of carbonyl  reductase  CBPR1  and CBPR3 ). 
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
Study  drug administration:  
 
Investigators  and patients  will be blinded  and study  agents  will be indistinguishable  from each  other.  
Patients  who cannot  swallow  pi[INVESTIGATOR_206914],  as capsules  may not be opened.   Study  
agent  will begin  on the same  day as anti-HER2  therapy  (+/- 1 week).   Each  study  participant  will self- 
administer  1 capsule  by [CONTACT_206941].   Participants  will document  the number  of capsules  taken  
and any side effects on the study medicine daily log (Appendix A) 
Carvedilol  and placebo  will be started  at an initial  dose  of 3.125mg  twice  a day.  Treatment  in both 
the carvedilol  and control  group  will be systematically  up-titrated  at weeks  3, 6, and 9 (+/- 1 week).  
All capsules  will be labeled  by [CONTACT_180196] (1, 2, 3, 4) and will otherwise  be identical  in appearance.  
The plan outlined  in Section  11.0 “Toxicities/Side  Effects”  will be utilized  to inform  the patient  about  
adverse  events.  Study  drug will be made  by [CONTACT_206940] (Core  Manager:  
Mark G. Klang,  MS, RPh,  BCNSP,  PhD).   Upon  completion  of the study  period,  the principal  
investigator,  treating  cardiologist,  and study  staff will be unblinded  to the patient’s  randomization  
arm, so as to appropriately  plan ongoing  cardiology  care for the patient.  The decision  to continue  
carvedilol  therapy  as standard  cardiac  treatment  can be made  at the discretion  of the treating  
cardiologist  after the patient  is removed  from the study.  
Cardiac  Assessment:  
 
Routine  evaluations  will occur  at each  breast  cancer  medicine  visit per standard  of care.  In addition,  
among  patients  in the randomized  arm, follow -up visits  will be scheduled  with the Cardiology  PI [INVESTIGATOR_206915]-HER2  therapy  and at 3, 6, and 12 months  (+/- 4 weeks)  after randomization  to 
assess  for adverse  medication  effects  and symptoms  of congestive  heart  failure.   Additional  
cardiology  visits  will be scheduled  on an as needed  basis  if further  dose  adjustments  are deemed  
necessary  by [CONTACT_206942].   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_206916]: 14 -099 A(9)

are further  defined  in the study  calendar.  
 
At any point during  this study,  study  participants  and their oncologists  will be notified  of a significant  
decline  in LVEF  (defined  as an absolute  decrease  from baseline  LVEF  of 10-15% to below  50%,  or 
decrease  of > 16%),  and referral  to cardiology  will be recommended.  
 
Biomarker  evaluation:  
 
From  each  patient  at [ADDRESS_246810]  of care,  approximately  ten mL of peripheral  blood  will be collected  (1 green  top tube,  1 
lavender  top tube)  for the measurement  of TnI and high sensitivity  TnI. For the troponin  assays,  
plasma  will be separated  from peripheral  blood  and samples  will be frozen  for analysis  and will not 
be known  to the investigator  until the completion  of the study.  The TnI samples will be evaluated  by 
[CONTACT_206943].    At all MSKCC  sites,  blood  samples  should  be clearly  labeled  
before  transfer  to Main campus.  This labeling  should  include  the study  identifier  (IRB-assigned  
protocol  number),  MSKCC -assigned  patient  identifier  (once  available),  test ("troponin")  and the time 
point of sample  measurement.   TnI concentrations  will be determined  by a fluorometric  enzyme  
immunoassay  analyzer  (Tosoh  Bioscience,  Inc., San Francisco,  CA) with a low end sensitivity  of 
1.6 ng/ml.  Results  will be blinded  to the investigators  until study  is complete.   Any leftover  plasma  
will be stored  at -80oC by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ramanathan  in Laboratory  Medicine  to allow  for additional  biomarker  
analysis  (to be determined),  including  but not limited  to ultrasensitive  troponin -I which  we anticipate  
will be FDA approved  within  the next 12 months  or circulating  markers  of cardiac  inflammation.  
Additional  biomarker  testing  will be performed  either  by [CONTACT_206943], the 
Schmitt  Lab at MSKCC,  or Singulex  (Alameda,  CA).

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
12.1.  2D Echocardiography  and Speckle  Strain  
 
For Aim 1, the primary  outcome  variable  will be the prevalence  of subclinical  left ventricular  
dysfunction  during  anthracycline  and anti-HER2  therapy  as defined  by [CONTACT_206944] < 19% or a change  from baseline  of > 11%.   For Aim 2, the maximum change  in 
global  LVEF  (continuous  variable)  from beginning  to end of anti-HER2  therapy  (approximately  1 year 
or time of anti-HER2  therapy  discontinuation)  will serve  as the primary  outcome  variable.   Markers  of 
LV systolic  function  by [CONTACT_206945],  and 
secondary  outcome  variables  will include  1) incidence  of abnormal  LVEF  (< 50%)  and 2)maximum  
% change  from baseline  in global  longitudinal  strain.  
 
12.2.  Breast  Cancer  Specific Outcomes  
 
Patients  will be followed  for incidence  of anti-HER2  therapy  interruption  (secondary  outcome),  
defined  as > 1 cycle  of therapy  missed  (equal  to or greater  than 6 week  gap between  consecutive

anti-HER2  therapy  treatments).  As per the exploratory  aim, patients  will be followed  for breast  
cancer  recurrence,  development  of second  primary  cancer,  or all-cause  death.  
12.3.  Cardiac  Bioimarkers,  DNA  analysis  
 
Blood  samples  will be drawn  at prespecified  timepoints  as outlined  in previous  sections  of this 
protocol.   From  each  patient  at 7 prespecified  timepoints  approximately  ten mL of peripheral  blood  
will be collected  (1 green  top tube,  1 lavender  top tube)  for the measurement  of TnI (exploratory  
outcome).  For the troponin  assay,  plasma  will be separated  from peripheral  blood  and samples  will 
be frozen  for analysis  and will not be known  to the investigator  until the patient  has completed  the 
study.  The TnI samples  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_206946].    At all MSKCC  sites,  
blood  samples  should  be clearly  labeled  before  transfer  to Main campus.  This labeling  should   
include  the study  identifier  (IRB-assigned  protocol  number),  MSKCC-assigned patient  identifier  (once  
available),  test ("troponin")  and the time point of sample  measurement.   TnI concentrations  will       
be determined  by a fluorometric  enzyme  immunoassay  analyzer  (Tosoh  Bioscience,  Inc., San 
Francisco,  CA) with a low end sensitivity  of 0.06 ng/ml.   Leftover  plasma  will be stored  at -80oC by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ramanathan  in Laboratory  Medicine  to allow  for additional  biomarker  analysis  (to be  
determined),  including  but not limited  to ultrasensitive  troponin -I which  we anticipate  will be FDA 
approved  within  the next 12 months  or circulating  markers  of cardiac  inflammation.   Additional  
biomarker  testing  will be performed  either  by [CONTACT_206943], the Schmitt  Lab at 
MSKCC,  or by [CONTACT_85857]  (Alameda,  CA) 
Saliva  samples  will be collected  under  protocol  #06-107, using  the Oragene -Discover  kit (DNA  
GEnotek,  Ontario,  Canada)  at the time of enrollment,  and banked  at the Breast  and Imaging  Center  
for future  analysis  to assess  the association  between  candidate  polymorphisms  (i.e. HER2  
polymorphisms  IIe655Val  and Ala1170Pro  and polymorphisms  of carbonyl  reductase  CBPR1  and 
CBPR3 ) (exploratory  outcome)  and changes  in myocardial  strain  . 
 
13.0 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  may withdraw  from the study  at any time.  
13.1.  Criteria  for discontinuation  of study  agent  
 
Patients  randomized  to carvedilol  versus  placebo  will be discontinued  from study  agent  should  they 
experience  any of the following:  
• Severe,  unexpected  toxicities  or side effects,  i.e. symptomatic  bradycardia  or hypotension,  
that is not responsive  to dose  modification  per section  11.1.  
• If their treatment  with anti-HER2  therapy  is discontinued.  
• A significant  decline  in LVEF,  defined  by [CONTACT_206947] 10- 
15% to below  50%,  or absolute  decrease  in LVEF  of  > 16%.  
 
After discontinuation,  every  effort  will be made  to continue  with routine  cardiac  surveillance  and 
cardiology  follow -up per protocol.   Participants  will be followed  clinically  until adverse  events  resolve,  
if applicable.  
 
Other  reasons  for study  discontinuation  at the discretion  of the investigator  include,  but are not 
limited  to: 
• Change  in patient  eligibility

• Non-compliance  with the defined  treatment  plan 
• Protocol  violation  
• Investigator’s  decision  based  on patient’s  best interest  
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death  
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
14.1.  Statistical  Analysis:  
 
Aim 1: The proportion  of patients  with abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  values  by [CONTACT_206948]  + antiHER2  therapy  (approximately  14 months  after initiating  treatment  with 
anthracycline  chemotherapy  and 1 year after initiating  anti-HER2  therapy)  will be estimated  together  
with the corresponding  95% confidence  interval  using  all women  enrolled  to this study.  All women  
eligible  for the randomized  study  will be counted  as having  abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  for 
this analysis.  This number  will be added  to the remaining  women  who do not have abnormal  global  
longitudinal  strain  by [CONTACT_206949] a later 
timepoint  to form the numerator  of the estimated  proportion.  The denominator  will consist  of all 
women  enrolled  to the study.  
Aim 2:  The primary  endpoint  of the randomized  study  is the maximum  change  in global  LVEF  from 
the start of anti-HER2  therapy  until [ADDRESS_246813]  as long as data are missing  at 
random  (missingness  is independent  of unobserved  measurements  conditional  on the observed  
data),  allows  participants  with incomplete  data to contribute  information  to the estimated  treatment  
effect,  and is consistent  with the intent -to-treat principle.[ 34, 35] 
Secondary  aims:  Secondary  endpoints  for the randomized  study  that will be described  in an 
exploratory  manner  include  changes  in global  longitudinal  strain  and the proportion  of patients  who 
discontinue  anti-HER2  therapy.  Proportions  will be estimated  with 95% confidence  intervals  
separately  in the two arms.  Although  formal  testing  for differences  between  the arms  for these  
secondary  endpoints  is not a primary  goal of this study,  depending  upon  the data we may further  
explore  differences  between  the arms  using  a Wilcoxon  rank-sum test or linear  mixed  models  with 
an indicator  for treatment  arm in the model  to explore  differences  in changes  in global  longitudinal  
strain  
Exploratory  aims:    The proportion  of patients  with local or distant  breast  cancer  recurrence,  
second  primary  cancer,  and death  will be described  in an exploratory  manner.   We expect  the 
number  of women  who develop  a recurrence,  a second  primary  cancer  or die within  the time frame

of this study  to be too small  to do any type of analysis.  However,  if the data permit  we may estimate  
the cumulative  incidence  of these  events  using  methods  for competing  risks as appropriate.  
General  analysis:  In the observational  cohort,  we will descriptively  estimate  the proportion  of 
patients  with abnormal  LVEF  (< 55%)  at each  time point and the proportion  who discontinue  anti- 
HER2  therapy.  
14.2.  Sample  Size:  
 
Aim 1:  With a minimum  of 80 patients,  we will be able to estimate  the proportion  of patients  with 
abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  to within  + 0.11.  
Aim 2:  The study  is designed  to detect  an intergroup  difference  of absolute  difference  of 10 
percentage  points  (simple  difference)  in the change  in LVEF  between  the experimental  and control  
group.   Ten percent  is the change  in LVEF  that is associated  with differing  degrees  of left ventricular  
dysfunction,  and long-term studies  among  non-cancer  patients  have shown  that outcomes  differ  
among  groups  of patients  who have LVEF  differing  by 10%.[ 22]   Assuming  a standard  deviation  of 8 
(based  on our preliminary  data),  at least 28 patients  (14 patients  per arm) will be needed  to 
demonstrate  this aim with 90% statistical  power  if the data were  normally  distributed  and we were  to 
use a t-test  a two-sided  Type  I error probability  of 0.05.   To account  for the possibility  that the 
maximum  change  in LVEF  measurements  may not be normally  distributed,  we have planned  to use 
a Wilcoxon  rank-sum test for the analysis.  The relative  efficiency  of the rank-sum test compared  with 
the t-test is approximately  95%if  the data are normally  distributed  and is greater  if the data are 
skewed  indicating  that we should  maintain  greater  than 80% power  for this analysis.  [36]  To allow   
for approximately  10% of the patients  to drop out, we plan to enroll  a total of 32 patients  to the 
randomized  study.   Based  on preliminary  data,[ 30] we estimate  that 41% of patients  with early 
HER2 -positive  breast  cancer  treated  with anthracyclines  followed  by [CONTACT_206950]  (or 
other  anti-HER2  regimens)  will develop  abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  (<19%)  at the completion  
of anthracycline  treatment.   To achieve  our target  sample  size of 32 patients  in Aim 2, a minimum   of 
80 patients  will be enrolled  for Aim 1. To account  for the possibility  that some  patients  enrolled  in  
Aim 1 may already  be taking  ACE-inhibitors  or beta blockers  (expected  to be no more  than 10-15%)  
and not be eligible  for Aim 2 we may  enroll  an additional  20 patients  as needed  in order  to reach  our 
randomization  target.   The maximum  accrual  for this study  is 100 patients.  Given  the annual   
estimate  of ~[ADDRESS_246814]  study  accrual  will be completed  in 18 
months.  With 14 months  of follow -up on all patients,  the total duration  of this study  is expected  to be 
approximately  32 months.  
 
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDUR ES 
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility.  
 
Obtain  informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_40136].  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 14 -099 A(9)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_246815]  be registered  through  the Protocol  Participant  Registration  (PPR)  Office  
at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center.  PPR is available  Monday  through  Friday  from 
8:30am  – 5:30pm  at [PHONE_214].  Registrations  must  be submitted  via the PPR Electronic  
Registration  System  (http://ppr/ ).  The completed  signature  [CONTACT_28651]/RA  or 
verbal  script/RA,  a completed  Eligibility  Checklist  and other  relevant  documents  must  be 
uploaded  via the PPR Electronic  Registration  System.  
Of note,  patients  who are eligible  for Aim 2 will be re-registered  through  PPR,  using  a 
separate  (Part  2) Eligibility  Checklist,  before  beginning  this arm, in order  to minimize  risks for 
protocol  violations   regarding  eligibility.  
15.3 Randomization  
 
After completion  of anthracycline  based  chemotherapy  and prior to initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy,  
study  participants  from Aim 1 will undergo  a repeat  routine  transthoracic  echocardiogram.   Patients  
with abnormal  global  longitudinal  strain  (< 19% or a relative  decrease  in global  longitudinal  strain  by 
> 11% from baseline)  and who do not meet  any exclusion  criteria  (outlined  in section  9.0) will be 
randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to receive  carvedilol  vs placebo  prior to initiation  of anti-HER2  therapy.  
After eligibility  is established  and immediately  after consent  is obtained,  patients  will be registered  
with PPR.  Randomization  will be accomplished  by [CONTACT_206951].  
16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the CRC  
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database  (Clinical  Research  
Database  (CRDB).  Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  
record.  The principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_206917]. 
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be 
monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the 
attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.   Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  
compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  at a minimum  of two times  per year,  more  
frequently  if indicated.  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new policies  
set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and

Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/patientsafety/dsm  -guidelines  /page1  
 
The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  
The MSKCC  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://smskpsps9/dept/ocr/OCR%20Website%20Documents/Clinical%20Research%20Quality%20 A  
ssurance%20(CRQA)/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20Monitoring%20Plan.pdf  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_206952].  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  
research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III  clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  
Research  Council  and Institutional   Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level or 
risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industry  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring  
procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

participant.  
Consent  process : All patients  at MSKCC  who meet  the inclusion  criteria  will be eligible.  Participation  
in the trial is voluntary.   All patients  will be required  to sign a statement  of informed  consent,  which  
must  conform  to IRB guidelines.  The informed  consent  procedure  is described  in Section  18.0.  
Possible  Toxicities/Side -Effects :  There  are risks associated  with treatment  as described  in Section  
11.0;  however,  patients  screened  for enrollment  will be deemed  appropriate  for treatment  
independent  of this study.  
Risks  of research  participation:   The greatest  risk is release  of information  from health  or research  
records  in a way that violates  privacy  rights.   MSKCC  will protect  records  so that name,  address,  
phone  number,  and any other  information  that identifies  the participant  will be kept private.   It will be 
stated  to the participant  that the chance  that this information  will be given  to an unauthorized  
individual  without  the participant’s  permission  is very small.  
 
Benefits :  A preventive  treatment  strategy  with beta blockers  among  patients  who are at increased  
risk for cardiotoxicity  due to abnormal  myocardial  strain  may lower  the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_206918]: 14 -099 A(9)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_246817]  cancer  events.  
It is unlikely  that the research  using  collected  biospecimens  will be of any medical  benefit  to 
participants.   Neither  the patient  nor the treating  physician  will be told of the specific  results  of any 
research  tests  on the samples;  except  in the case  of an uncovered  incidental  finding  which  may be 
critical  to the preventive  care of the participant  or their family.   Research  using  blood  or tissues  in 
this study  could  lead to medical  and scientific  products  that could  improve  prevention,  diagnosis  and 
treatment  of disease.  
 
Costs/compensation :  Patients  will be charged  for physician  visits,  routine  laboratory  tests  and 
radiologic  studies  required  for monitoring  their condition.  The patients  will not be billed  for the study  
drug,  carvedilol/placebo.   The participant  is informed  that there  are no plans  to provide  financial  
compensation  for use of their human  biologic  specimens,  nor are there  plans  for the participant  to 
receive  money  for any new products,  tests,  and discoveries  that might  come  from this research.  
Alternatives :  The alternative  to this trial would  be not to participate  in the study  and receive  routine  
standard  of care.  
Confidentiality :  Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93051].  Patients’  names  and any other  identifying  information  will not be used  in 
reports  or publications  resulting  from this study.  Other  authorized  agencies  and appropriate   internal  
personnel  (e.g. qualified  monitors  from MSKCC)  and external  personnel,  its authorized  agents,  the 
FDA,  and/or  other  governmental  agencies)  may review  patient  records  as required.  
Patient  safety :  Patients  are monitored  by [CONTACT_206953].  In the case  of an adverse  reaction,  immediate  medical  attention  is available.  In the 
evenings  and weekends,  we have a 24-hour urgent  care facility  for outpatients.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_206919].  
Monitoring  of data to ensure  safety:   This study  is to be monitored  by [CONTACT_206954]. This 
incorporates  an independent  data and safety  monitoring  board  established  by [CONTACT_206955].  The analysis  of safety  will include  all patients.  Adverse  events,  including    
all toxic effects  of treatment,  will be tabulated  individually,   and summarized  by [CONTACT_206956].  
 
Voluntariness  of research  participation:   It is stated  that taking  part in this study  is voluntary  and 
patients  have the right to withdraw  at any time.  Participation  in the study  will not impact  on the 
clinical  care patients  receive.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
Medical  information  is confidential.   The participant’s  personal  identity  will not be used  in reports  that 
are written  about  the research.   The MSKCC  IRB/PB  will review  all requests  for research  performed  
involving  biospecimens  ascertained  through  this protocol.   Blood  and tissue  samples  will be stored  
with a code  linked  to the patient’s  medical  record.  With the permission  of the IRB/PB,  research  
studies  on cellular,  genetic,  immunologic,  or other  features  of tumor  or normal  samples  may be 
performed  with no names  attached  to the samples  but linked  by [CONTACT_206957].  The 
results  of any research  using  blood  or tissues  will not be placed  in the medical  record.

MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  pursuant  
to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of protected  health  
information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  A 
Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_93052]  (IRB/PB).  
 
The consent  indicates  that samples  and genetic  information  collected  may be shared  with other  
qualified  researchers.  Such  information  will not include  identifying  information  such  as name.  It is 
also stated  in the consent  and Research  Authorization  that research  data (e.g. genomic  sequence)  
may be placed  into databases  monitored  by [CONTACT_154108],  and may be made  
accessible  to investigators  approved  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. government.  
 
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.  SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
[EMAIL_440] .  All other  reports  should  be sent to [EMAIL_2141] . 
 
For all other  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to

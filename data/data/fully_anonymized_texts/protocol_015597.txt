Study  Objectives:  To assess the efficacy and safety of S5G4T -1 compared to S5G4T -1 
Vehicle when  applied  once daily  for 12 weeks  in patients  with 
papulopustular rosacea  
Study  Design:  In this Phase 3, double -blind, vehicle -controlled study, patients will be  
admitted  into this multi- center,  double-blind, randomized, vehicle -
controlled, parallel -group  pi[INVESTIGATOR_534299] a written  informed 
consent has been obtained and after all inclusion/exclusion criteria have 
been met.  Male and female patients at least 18 years of age with 
moderate  or severe  papulopustular rosacea  [Investigator Global  
Assessment (IGA) grade 3 or 4] will be eligible for enrollment for daily  
treatment  with S5G4T-1 or its vehicle  for 12 weeks.  
Study  
Population: Approximately  [ADDRESS_888255] 18 years  of age, who 
meet  the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled  in the study. 
Investigational 
Sites  It is estimated  that up to 28 study centers  in US will participate  in this 
study. 
Dosing: Patients will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_888256] once  
daily for 12 weeks. Patients will use a “pea- size” amount for each area of  
the face (chin, left cheek,  right cheek,  nose, left forehead  and right 
forehead).  The study product will be spread as a thin layer in such a way  
as to provide an even  distribution,  avoiding the eyes,  lips, inside the nose, 
mouth and all mucous membranes.  Patients  will receive detailed  
instructions on the method of application and quantity to use in order to  
assure that treatment is harmonized among all patients to best extent  
possible.

Methodology:  Clinical and  Safety  Evaluations will be  performed  at: 
1. Visit 1/Screening  
2. Visit 2/Baseline,  Day  1 
3. Visit 3/Week 2,  Day  15 (± 3  Days)  
4. Visit 4/Week 4,  Day  29 (± 3  Days)  
5. Visit 5/Week 8,  Day  57 (± 3  Days)  
6. Visit 6/Week 12, Day 85 (± 4 Days)/End of Treatment/End of  
Study)  
Patients  will be admitted  into the study after all inclusion/exclusion  
criteria have been met, including a clinical diagnosis of rosacea and after  
written  informed  consent  has been obtained. Subjects  with  severe rosacea 
who are appropriate  for systemic  treatment  need  to be counseled  regarding 
their treatment options by  [CONTACT_45822]. 
At each visit, a 5 -point IGA scale of rosacea; rosacea erythema, and  
telangiectasia;  and inflammatory  (papules,  pustules)  lesion  counts  will be  
performed  and recorded.  
Safety will be assessed at all visits, and will include monitoring of local  
adverse experiences, Investigator Cutaneous Safety Assessment rating of  
dryness a nd scaling and Local Tolerability Assessment rating of itching 
and burning/stinging on a scale ranging from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe);  
patients will complete a Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) questionnaire  
at Visit 2,  3, 4, 5 and 6 and Rosacea Quality of  Life Questionnaire  
(RosaQoL)  at Baseline and Visit [ADDRESS_888257] site(s).  
In addition to IGA, at each visit, the following safety measures will be  
recorded:  monitoring for any AE including  local  and systemic;  
investigator Cutaneous Safety Assessment rating of erythema, dryness  
and scaling and Local Tolerability Assessments rating of itching and  
burning/stinging on a scale ranging  from 0 (None)  to 3 (Severe).  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on females of child- bearing 
potential  at Screening,  Baseline and every  4 weeks  during study or at early  
termination.  
Regardless of the  duration of the study, patients  that exhibit serious  
adverse event (SAE), will be followed up until the SAE resolves, based 
on investigator’s  medical  judgment. 
Clinical Trial 
Duration  Screening:  -35 to 0 days prior  to Baseline 
Duration of treatment: 12 weeks/[ADDRESS_888258]  
dosage and

Statistical  
Method:  General  Statistical  Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or  
later unless otherwise stated.  Statistical significance will be based on  
two-tailed  tests of the null hypothesis  resulting  in p-values  of 0.05 or less. 
Analysis  Populations  
The intent -to-treat (ITT)  population will consist  of all randomized  patients  
who were  dispensed  study product.  The safety  population will be 
comprised of all randomized patients who are presumed to have used the  
study product at least once and who provide at least one post -baseline 
safety evaluation.  Patients will be considered per protocol (PP) if they  
complete  the 12-week  evaluation  without  noteworthy study protocol  
violations  (i.e., any patient  or investigator  activity  that could have  possibly  
interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the  
precise evaluation of treatment efficacy).  
Patients  that discontinue  from  the study due to an adverse event  related  to 
study treatment  or documented lack of treatment effect  will be included in 
the PP population. Data for these subjects  will not be imputed  by [CONTACT_534368]. Prior to breaking the blind, other  
additional  criteria  may be added  to the list to accommodate for unforeseen  
events  that occurred  during the conduct  of the trial that result  in 
noteworthy study protocol violations  
Evaluations  and Analyses  
Inflammatory lesion count will be recorded for each patient at Baseline  
and at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. The absolute and percent change from  
baseline of inflammatory  lesions  will be derived  for each patient  at 
Weeks  2, 4, 8 and 12.  
The IGA will be recorded  for each patient  at Baseline,  Weeks  2, 4, 8 and 
12. The IGA will be dichotomized into “success”  and “failure” at 
Weeks  2, 4, [ADDRESS_888265]  
Clear.  
The Rosacea erythema assessment, and telangiectasia assessment will be  
recorded  at Baseline, Weeks  2, 4, 8 and 12.  
Patients will be asked to complete a Patient Reported Outcome, PRO  
questionnaire at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 and a Rosacea Quality of  
Life, RosaQoL questionnaire at Baseline and Week 12(or at the early  
termination  visit).  
All assessments will  be conducted for both ITT and PP.

Statistical  
Method  
(continued):  Statistical  Hypothesis  Testing  
Tests  of superiority for the absolute  change  from  Baseline in inflammatory  
lesions will be based on either parametric or non -parametric methods  
consistent  with the statistical assumptions  required  to support  the 
analyses.  Specifically,  the tests of superiority  will be based  on an 
ANCOVA with factors  of treatment  and analysis  center  and the respective 
Baseline lesion count as a covariate or on ranked data submitted to an  
ANCOVA with factors  of treatment  and analysis  center  and the respective 
Baseline lesion count as a covariate.  If the treatment -by-analysis center  
interaction effect is significant at an alpha less than 0.10, then the effect  
will be  included in the  model;  otherwise it will be  removed.  
A skewness test, based on the methods presented by [CONTACT_85215] 1984, will be  
applied  to the residuals  resulting  from  an ANCOVA.  A two-sided  p-value  
for the skewness test significant at 0.01 will imply the use of the non-  
parametric method. If a parametric analysis is indicated, the results of the  
parametric analysis will be considered the primary analysis.  Should a  
non-parametric analysis be indicated, the absolute or percent changes in  
inflammatory  lesions  will be rank-transformed  prior to submitting  them  to 
the ANCOVA.  Results of the rank- transformed analyses then will be  
considered  the primary  analysis;  however,  results  of the non- rank-
transformed analyses will also be  presented.  
The IGA will be dichotomized into “success” and “failure” with a patient  
considered  a success  for those  visits  if the Investigator’s  Global  
Assessment  is at least 2 grades  less than Baseline  and “Clear”  or “Almost 
Clear”.  The analysis of the dichotomized IGA will be based on a logistic  
regression  test with  factors  of treatment  group and  analysis  center.  
Missing  Efficacy  Data  Imputations  
Missing Week 12 data will be estimated by [CONTACT_534369].  Missing lesion count data will be derived fo r the 
analysis  using the method  of Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  
multiple  imputation.  The pattern  of missing  observations  in each 
treatment  group cannot  influence the missing  value  estimation  in the other  
because  the imputation  will be conducted independently for each 
treatment  group.  
Safety  
Evaluation:  Safety  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_658529]  (AEs),  
Cutaneous Safety Assessments for dryness and scaling, assessments for  
scores (erythema and telangiectasia) and Patient Global Impression of  
Treatment  Side-Effects  (PGI- SE) will be presented  with descriptive  
statistics at Baseline and at the scheduled study visits.  Frequencies and  
percentages  for each outcome  category  will be included in these statistics.

 7. INTRODUCTION  AND  BACKGROUND  
S5G4T -1 is an innovative topi[INVESTIGATOR_534314] 5% encapsulated benzoyl peroxide  (E-
BPO) that Sol -Gel is developi[INVESTIGATOR_534315].  If approved, S5G4T -[ADDRESS_888270]  women  more  often  than men at a ratio of 3 to 1 (Jansen and Plewig 1997 and 
McDonnell and Tomecki 2000).  Rosacea usually starts as flushing and subtle redness on the  
cheeks, nose, chin or forehead. Alcohol, hot drinks, spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716], stress, sunlight and extreme heat  
or cold can trigger  the onset  of this disease.  If left untreated,  rosacea  can slowly  worsen  over time.  
As the condition progresses, patients experience inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules), vivid erythema and telangiectasia.  Patients may develop furuncles, cystic nodules, granulomas  
and tissue hypertrophy, sometimes leading to rhinophyma. 
The first report  on the  treatment of rosacea with  benzoyl peroxide  as a single  agent  was described  
by [CONTACT_534371]. in 1983. In this limited study, 5% benzoyl peroxide, after [ADDRESS_888271] of 5% benzoyl peroxide and 1% clindamycin to treat patients having moderate to severe  
rosacea.  The most dramatic effect of the benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin treatment was on the  
reduction of papules and pustules. Side effects included the well -known effects of benzoyl  
peroxi de, burning and itching. 
Yamasaki et al. published a paper in [ADDRESS_888272]  a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of rosacea.  
Rosacea is treated with both systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491].  However, topi[INVESTIGATOR_658508].  
According to the U.S. National Rosacea Society, approximately 16 million people in the U nited  
States  are affected  by [CONTACT_534372].  According to a study commissioned  by [CONTACT_1034], approximately  
4.8 million people in the [LOCATION_002] experience subtype II symptoms and physicians estimate  
that only 20% of the U.S. rosacea population is treated.  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_534317] $392 million in the

 11. OVERALL STUDY  DESIGN  
This study will be a randomized,  double -blind, multicenter,  parallel  group, active - and vehicle-
controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_534321], and safety of S5G4T -1 and its vehicle for the  treatment 
of papulopustular rosacea for 12 weeks. Approximately 350 patients with moderate to severe 
rosacea (rated 3 or 4 on the 5- point IGA scale) will be enrolled at up to 28 sites. Patients  in this 
randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group multi -center study will be  randomly  
assigned  in a 2:1 ratio to S5G4T -1 or vehicle,  respectively.  Subjects  with severe  rosacea  who are 
appropriate  for systemic  treatment  need  to be counseled  regarding  their treatment options  by [CONTACT_11087].  
Patients will receive once daily treatment with S5G4T -1 or vehicle cream fo r 12 weeks. After the  
screening period, qualified patients will be randomly assigned at the Baseline visit and treated for  
12 weeks.  Efficacy  assessments  will include  facial  inflammatory  lesion  counts  and IGA 
assessment ranging from 0 (Clear) to 4 (Severe).  Investigators will be provided with instructions  
for lesion counts to ensure consistency of procedure. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) will be  
assessed with the PAPSS (Patient Assessment of Papulopustular rosacea Signs and Symptoms),  
PAPI  (Patien t Assessment  of Papulopustular  rosacea  Impacts)  and PGI-S (Patient  Global  
Impression of Symptom Severity) that will be administered at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, or  
at early termination.  In addition, the PGI -C (Patient Global Impression of Change), PG I-TS 
(Patient  Global  Impression of Treatments  Satisfaction)  and PGI-SE (Patient  Global  Impression of 
Treatments Side Effects) will be administered at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, or at early termination  
[FDA Guidance 2009]. Rosacea Quality of Life (RosaQoL) quest ionnaire will be administered at 
Baseline,  and Week  12, or at early  termination.  Safety  will be assessed  at all visits  and will include  
monitoring local  and systemic  adverse events  (AEs);  the investigator  Cutaneous  Safety  
Assessment rating of erythema, dryness and scaling and Local Tolerability Assessments rating of  
itching  and burning/stinging on a scale ranging from 0 (None) to 3 (Severe). 
Patients  will return  to centers  for IGA,  lesion  counts, PRO  questionnaire, , Investigator  Cutaneous  
Safety Assessment and Local Tolerability Assessments at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. At Week 12 (or  
at the early termination visit) patients will be asked to complete RosaQoL questionnaire. Adverse  
events and concomitant medications will be assessed thr oughout the treatment period. A urine  
pregnancy  test is required  at Visit 1,  2, 4, 5 and 6 for  all females of  child -bearing  potential.  
Clinical Evaluations  will be performed  at:

 12. STUDY  POPULATION  
12.1. Randomization and Blinding 
It is planned that approximately 350 patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be  
enrolled in this study at up to [ADDRESS_888275] with the study per sonnel. Patients will be  
randomly assigned in a  2:1 ratio as follows: 
• E-BPO  Cream,  5% (S5G4T -1) (234 patients)  
• Vehicle Cream (S5G4T -2) (117 patients)  
Each patient who signs an informed consent, meets inclusion/exclusion criteria, and successfully  
completes the screening procedures, will be enrolled in the study. The patient randomization  
schedule will be a permuted block design stratified by [CONTACT_76537]. Blocks will be  
composed of 3 treatment assignments in a ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_888276] and vehicle, respectively.  
Complete  blocks  from  the randomization schedule  will be allocated  to investigational  sites as they 
randomize  patients  to maintain  the randomization ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_888277], but may determine that unblinding one or all patients may be necessary in the  
case that the safety  of study patients is at risk. In an emergency, the study blind may be broken 
only if: 
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_264629]/or the PI, it is in the patient's best interest to do 
so 
• Knowledge  of the treatment will alter  the clinical  management  of the patient  
In the case of an emergency that requires unblinding, the Investigator can request to unblind the  
patient  without  prior  contact  [CONTACT_658531] -up between  the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor must occur so that all parties are aware of the unblinding.  
Although it is recommended  that the Investigator  contact  [CONTACT_658532], in instances where this is not feasible or advisable the PI [INVESTIGATOR_534322]'s treatment assignment.  In all situations, the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  
will be used to obtain treatment  assignment  information  with limited  access  to only the above -
designated  individuals, and any  unblinding will be  documented as  a protocol  deviation.

 13. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
13.1. Study Patient  Identification  
When the patient signs the informed consent, he/she will be assigned a three (3) -digit patient 
number. The complete patient ID will consist of the 3 -digit site number followe d by [CONTACT_941] 3-digit 
patient  number: e.g., (first  patient  screened  at site . This number will remain  with the 
patient  for the duration of the study and will not be reassigned  to another patient  should the patient  
screen  fail. 
13.2. Screen  Failure  and Discontinuation Criteria  
A screen failure is a patient who is not randomized/enrolled in the study due to ineligibility, after  
signing an Informed Consent Form, and would not have received study product. The Informed  
Consent Form signed by [CONTACT_534379]. The documentation should include identification of the  
eligibility criterion or criteria that were and were not met.  The patient should not be re -screened  
for this s tudy without Sol- Gel’s approval.  
Although encouraged to complete the study whenever possible, patients are free to discontinue  
their participation in this study at any time and for any reason without prejudice. A patient may  
be withdrawn from the study prior to study completion for any of the following  reasons:  
• Investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_534345]’s  best interest  to continue. 
• Patient  Request  /Withdraw  Consent – Whenever  the patient  decides  it is in his/her best 
interest  to withdraw. 
• Lack  of Efficacy/ Worsening  of Condition. 
• Adverse Event – when  the investigator thinks it’s  in the patient’s  best interest 
• Lost to Follow -up – Documentation confirmed at minimum by [CONTACT_534380].  Every  effort  should be made to capture an explanation  for the lost- to follow- 
up event.  
• Protocol Violation  – When  requirements  of the protocol are not respected,  especially  when  
patient safety  is concerned. 
• Pregnancy. 
• Unblinding of study product. 
Study staff should make efforts to encourage patients to complete the study on time. If a patient  
prematurely withdraws during the study, every effort should be made to complete at least the  
Week 12/End of Study assessments.  
In the case of patients who discontinue due to an Adverse Event, the  Investigator will conduct  
follow- up contacts with the patient until the Investigator, Sponsor and Medical Monitor agree the  
event is satisfactorily  resolved and/or stabilized. 
Patients  discontinued early from the  study shall not be replaced. 

SGT -54-02, Ver 4.[ADDRESS_888289] be signed by [CONTACT_534381]. A copy of the  
signed consent  will be given to every  patient  (or legally  authorized  representative)  and the original  
will be  maintained with the patients’ records.  
Patients that require a  wash -out of more than 30 days from their initial informed consent/assent  
signing must be  re-consented before  any further study procedures can begin.  
13.4. Assignment  of Randomization 
The patient randomization schedule will be a permuted block design stratified by [CONTACT_534382]. Blocks will be composed of 3 treatment assignments in a ratio of 2:[ADDRESS_888290] supplied pump in each kit is marked  A (e.g. number  of pump within  a kit is XXXXA),  at 
Visit 4/ Week 4 the patient will return the pump and will be dispensed with the next pump which  
is marked B.  At Visit 5/ Week 8, the patient will return the pump and will be dispensed with a  
pump marked C.  Pump marked as D may be dispensed to patients who lost/damaged/ran- out of  
study product. 
13.5. Demographics/Medical   History  
A demographic profil e and complete medical history will be recorded prior to starting study  
product. The medical history will include a complete review of all current diseases and their  
respective  treatments.  
13.6. Concomitant   Medications  
Concomitant medications and any medications taken in the 30 days prior to signing informed 
consent will be recorded as prior/concomitant medications (using their generic name, if known)  
with the corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded will include prescription and  
over-the-counter (OTC) medications and dietary supplements. All medications taken on either a  
regular or “prn” basis, including vitamins, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_287772], should be recorded on this  
page  prior  to commencing  the use of the study product. 
13.7. Physical  Examin ation  
The investigator, sub- investigator or appropriately delegated and qualified designee will perform  
a brief physical examination, prior to the patient starting study product. The exam will include  
heart, lung, abdomen evaluation as well as recording he ight, weight and vital signs. Vital signs  
are to include sitting  blood pressure, oral temperature, heart rate  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842].

Females  of childbearing  potential  (excluding women  who are surgically  sterilized  or post-
menopausal for at least 2 years), in addition to having a negative urine pregnancy test, must  be 
willing  to use an acceptable form  of birth  control  during the study. An investigator  could repeat  the 
pregnancy test at any time during the study if there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_534346]. Urine pregnancy test will also be conducted starting at Visit 1/Screening and  at each 
visit [Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (End of Study)]. For the purpose of this study, the  
following are considered acceptable methods  of birth  control:  intrauterine  device  (IUD);  
hormonal (injections, implants, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); abstinence; oral contraceptives;  
female  condom;  diaphragm  with spermicides;  cervical  cap with spermicides; contraceptive  
sponge. 
Patients entering the trial that are on hormonal contraceptives must have been on this method for  
at least 3 months (90 days) prior to the trial and continue the method for the duration of the trial.  
Patients who had used hormonal contraception and stopped must have stopped no less than [ADDRESS_888292] 
to ensure  its efficacy.  A sterile  sexual  partner  is not considered  an adequate form  of birth  control.

14.5. Patient  Reported  Outcomes  (PRO) 
There are six PRO questionnaires to be administered in the study and each is summarized below.  
Each will be administered to all patients during the designated study visits with instruction from  
the Study Staff  that they  be completed:  
• Only by [CONTACT_534383]’s response by a  
clinician  or anyone  else. 
• Prior to any other assessments or procedures.  
In the event the patient skips any quest ionnaire items; the Study Staff will ask the patient to  
complete the form.  The PRO questionnaire data will be entered into EDC, and a copy will be  
placed  with the  patient  source at  the site according to the  ICH-GCP  guideline  (4.9.5).  
The PAPSS ( Appendix 2 ): The PAPSS is a 4 -item questionnaire that asks patients to assess the  
severity  of their  rosacea symptoms (burning, itching, redness,  and bumps) in the  24 hours  prior  to 
assessment on an 11- point numeric rating scal e (NRS) ranging from “0=none” to “10=worst  
possible  symptom”. The questionnaire  can be completed  in less than one minute  and is 
administered via pen -and-paper at the Baseline visit and site visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (End  
of Study)  or early  termination.  Items  can be scored  individually as well  as together  to form  a total 
score.  In the present  context, within  visit scores  from  Items  1 (burning), 2 (itching), and 4 (bumps)  
are summed  and averaged to  create a total score  that will be  used to evaluate efficacy  hypotheses.  
The PAPI ( Appendix 3):  The PAPI [CONTACT_832] a 3 -item questionnaire that asks patients to assess the  
papulopustular rosacea related embarrassment, self -consciousness, and frustration in the 7 days  
prior t o assessment on an 11 -point NRS ranging from 0 [“not (concept) at all”] to 10 [“extremely 
(concept)”].  The questionnaire can be completed in less than one minute and is administered via  
pen-and-paper at the Baseline visit and site visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (End of Study) or early 
termination.  Items  can be  scored individually as well as  together to form  a total score.  
PGI-S (Appendix 4):  The PGI -S is a single item questionnaire that asks respondents to describe  
the severi ty of their rosacea symptoms “right now” (i.e., at the present moment) on a five -point  
verbal response scale ranging from “Clear” (face is clear, no redness) to “Severe” (face has  
numerous small and/or large bumps, severe redness). Patients are encouraged to look in a mirror  
to help with their response and the questionnaire can be completed in less than 30 seconds. The 
PGI-S is administered via pen -and-paper at the Baseline visit and site visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and  
12 (End of Study) or early termination. Though data generated from the PGI -C can be supportive  
of efficacy hypotheses, the primary purpose of the tool is to support anchor -based analyses that  
will inform how researchers may interpret the meaning of change in the primary and secondar y 
assessments.  
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  49 of 85  
 PGI-C (Appendix 5 ): The PGI -C is a single item questionnaire that asks respondents to describe  
the change  they  have noticed in their rosacea symptoms  since the start  of the study a  7-point  VRS  
ranging from “Very much improved” to “Very much worse”. Patients are encouraged to look in a  
mirror to help with their response  and the questionnaire  can be completed  in less than 30 seconds. 
The PGI -C is administered via pen -and-paper at the site visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (End of  
Study) or early termination. Though data generated from the PGI -C can be supportive of efficacy  
hypotheses, its primary  purpose  is to support  anchor -based  analyses  that will inform  how 
researchers may  interpret  the me aning of change  in the primary  and secondary assessments.  
PGI-TS (Appendix 6):  The PGI-TS is a single  item questionnaire  that asks respondents  to describe 
how satisfied  they  are “right  now”  with  the rosacea  treatment  administered  as part of the study on 
a 5-point VRS ranging from “I am very satisfied” to “I am very dissatisfied”. The questionnaire  
can be completed in less than 30 seconds and is administered via pen- and-paper at the site visits  
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (End of Study) or early termination. Though data generated from the  
PGI-TS can be used for other purposes, its primary purpose is to support anchor -based analyses  
that will inform  how researchers  may interpret  the meaning  of change in the primary  and secondary  
assessments.  
PGI-SE (Appendix 7):  The PGI-SE is a single  item questionnaire  that asks respondents  to describe  
how bothered they are “right  now”  with the rosacea  treatment  administered  as part of the study on 
a 5-point  VRS  ranging from  “I am not bothered”  to “I am extremely  bothered”. The questionnaire  
can be completed in less than 30 seconds and is administered via pen- and-paper at the site visits  
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (End of Study) or early termination.  Though data generated from the  
PGI-TSE can be used for other purposes, its primary purpose is to support anchor -based analyses  
that will inform  how researchers  may interpret  the meaning  of change  in the primary  and secondary 
assessments.  
14.6. Rosacea Quality  of Life (RosaQoL)  
There is a symptom  subscale with seven  questions  (items  2, 6, 9, 16, 17, 18 and 19 in Appendix  
8) , a functional  subscale with 3 questions  (items  13, 15 and 21 in Appendix 8) and an emotion  
subscale with 11 questions (items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 12, 14 and 20 in Appendix 8) to be  
administered in the study. The questionnaire will be administered to all patients during the  
designated study visits with the appropriate instructions from the Study Staff. The questionnaire  
should be  completed:  
• Only by [CONTACT_534383]’s response by a  
clinician  or anyone  else. 
• After  completion  of the Patient  Reported  Outcomes  (PRO) questionnaires  
In the event the patient skips any questionnaire items; the  Study Staff will ask the patient to  
complete  the form.  The QoL questionnaire  data will be entered  into the EDC  system  by [CONTACT_534384], and a copy will be placed with the patient source documents at the site according to the  
ICH-GCP  guideline  (4.9.5). 
All items should be  scored  for the following answers:  
• Never:  1 
• Rarely:  2 
• Sometimes: 3  
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  50 of 85  
 • Often:  4 
• All the  time: 5  
 
The Site Staff and anyone else provided with a copy of the RosaQoL instrument for the purpose  
of the study will be instructed that the RosaQoL instrument is protected by [CONTACT_534385]. No part of this may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by [CONTACT_61076], now  
known or  to be invented or adapted,  for purpose  of financial  gain or profit.  
An overall total score will be calculated; this score will be the unweighted mean of all RosaQoL  
questions. In addition to the total score, each subscale (symptom, functional and emotion) will  
also have  a score calculated;  these scores  will the unw eighted  mean  of the group of  questions  that 
comprise  the subscale.  Further  details  on the handling of missing  responses  and calculation  of the 
subscale scores will be  detailed  in the Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP).

Application  site reactions  (itching  and burning/stinging)  are not to be recorded  as adverse  events  
unless they result in either: 
• The temporary  discontinuation of the  study product. 
• The discontinuation of  the patient  from the  study.  
• The use of a new concomitant medication  in order  to treat this  event.  
Any other  application  site reaction  not listed  above  should be recorded  as adverse events  in the 
source  document and eCRFs. 
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.[ADDRESS_888297]  the Medical  Monitor  or the Sponsor  by [CONTACT_658537] a written  description 
as soon as possible.  The overseeing IRB should also be  notified. 
17.2. Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this  
treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or  
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered  
related  to this medicinal product. 
A serious adverse  event  (SAE) is an  adverse event that  results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event  (i.e., the patient  was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate  
risk of death  from  the event  as it occurred.  It does not include  an event  that, had it occurred  
in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
• Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658523]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  
conduct  normal life  functions  
• Congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Other adverse events that may be considered serious based upon appropriate medical  
judgment, may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent  one of the  outcomes listed above.  
Immediately Reportable Adverse Events (IRAE) is any serious AE or any AE that necessitates  
discontinuation of  study product, including pregnancy.  
Unexpected Adve rse Event is any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is  
not consistent with the current approved product labeling (package insert) for the study product, the Investigator’s  Brochure,  or as described  in the clinical  protocol  and consent  materials.  
Intensity  of Adverse  Events  are the maximum intensity  of an AE  during a  day should be  recorded  
on the eCRF.  If the intensity  of an AE changes  over a number  of days, then separate entries  should 
be made having distinct onset dates for  the changes in severity.  
• Mild - AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere with  
patient’s  daily  activities.  
• Moderate - AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient  
and may interfere wit h daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_534394].  
• Severe - AEs interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and traditionally require systemic  
drug therapy  or other treatment.  
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.[ADDRESS_888298]:  
Definitely  - The AE: 
• follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  study product administration 
• abates  upon discontinuation of  the study product  (de-challenge)  
• is confirmed by [CONTACT_658538] - The AE: 
• follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  study product administration 
• abates  upon discontinuation of  the study product  (de-challenge).  
• cannot be re asonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s state.  
Possible  - The AE: 
• follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  study product administration 
• but that could readily  be produced by a number  of other  factors.  
Unlikely  - The AE: 
• follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  study product administration. 
• could have  been  produced by [CONTACT_534396]’s  clinical state  or by [CONTACT_658539].  
Not related  - The AE: 
• does not have  a reasonable temporal association  with the  administration  of study product  
• has some  other  obvious explanation for the  event.  
17.4. Eliciting  and Reporting of Adverse  Events  
The investigator will periodically  assess patients  for the  occurrence of  adverse events.  In order  to 
avoid bias in eliciting  adverse events,  the patient  or parent/legally  authorized  representative should 
be asked  a non-specific question (e.g., “How  have  you been  feeling  since your last visit?”)  to assess  
whether any AE has been experienced since the last visit.  All adverse events (as defined in  
Section 17.2), either observed by [CONTACT_410047]/her medical collaborators, or  
reported by [CONTACT_63742], or in response to direct questioning, will be reported and 
documented in the source and the study reporting forms. When reporting an adverse event, the  
Investigator must assign a severity grade to each event and declare an opi[INVESTIGATOR_534353].  Serious or unexpect ed adverse events must be  
reported to the CRO within [ADDRESS_888299] assessment visit (or the Early  
Termination  Visit) must be  recorded on the AE  eCRF  with the  status of  the AE noted. 
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  56 of 85  
 Adverse  event  reporting  begins  from  the signing of informed  consent/assent. Study product -
related adverse events should be followed until resolved or 30 days after the final study  
treatment. Regardless the duration of the study, patients that exhibit serious adverse event (SAE),  
will be followed up until the SAE resolves, based on inves tigator’s medical judgment or are  
considered to be chronic (stabilized for at least 30 days). All events that are ongoing at this time  
will be  recorded as ongoing on the  eCRF.  
17.5. Expedited Reporting Responsibilities  of the Study Center  
For any serious or unexpected adverse event, the Sponsor or its designee must be notified within  
[ADDRESS_888300] -related adverse event(s) or serious adverse event(s)  
should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], events determined to be  
chronic  or the patien t is lost to follow -up. Resolution means  the patient  has returned  to the Baseline  
state of health, or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the  
adverse event.  The investigator should continue to report any significant fol low-up information  
to the sponsor up to the point that the event has resolved. Any serious adverse event reported by  
[CONTACT_534398] [ADDRESS_888301] learns of the occurrence  
of the event.  
When reporting a serious adverse event (SAE) the Investigator (or the Study Coordinator) will  
promptly report  any serious  adverse event  or pregnancy  to the Sponsor  or its designee  by [CONTACT_658540], immediately after the investigator becomes aware of the event.  An SAE form should be  
completed and sent by [CONTACT_6791], email, or overnight courier to the Sponsor or its designee within 24  
hours of knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_779]. In many cases, only pre liminary information will be  
available.  Appropriate follow up information should be sought (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], 
operative reports etc.) and a follow up SAE report form submitted. A designation of causality 
from the study product should always be included with a follow up report. Assess and report the  
causality  of the  event.  
17.6. Submitting  an Expedited Safety  Report  to the IRB 
Once all supporting documentation is received for the reported event, the Medical Monitor, in  
conjunction with Sol-Gel, will determine  if the safety  report  is eligible  for expedited  review.  When  
expedited safety reporting to regulatory authorities is indeed required, the Investigator should 
review and update any newly available materials at once.  Follow -up queries may be se nt to the  
study center to further clarify  the event.  
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  57 of 85  
 The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related  
AEs to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A Guideline and to 
other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, 
or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE  
reports submitted to regulatory authorities. All investigato rs participating in ongoing clinical  
studies will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_264664]  
17.7. SAE  & AEs Requiring Discontinuation of Study Drug, including Pregnancies  
ANY SAE,  WHICH  OCCURS  AFTER  A PATIENT  HAS  ENTERED  THE STUDY,  WHETHER  
OR NOT RELATED TO STUDY PRODUCT, MUST BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR OR  
ITS DESIGNEE  IMMEDIATELY  (WITHIN  24 HOURS)  VIA TELEPHONE,  EMAIL  OR 
FACSIMILE.  IF INITIALLY  REPORTED  VIA TELEPHONE,  THIS  MUST  BE FOLLOWED -
UP BY A FACSIMILE OR EMAIL OF THE WRITTEN SAE REPORT WITHIN  [ADDRESS_888302]  (including laboratory  
abnormalities)  should be reported  to the Sponsor  or its designee  immediately  and within  [ADDRESS_888303] will be discontinued  
from the study, but, regardless of t he duration of the study, patients that exhibit serious adverse  
event  (SAE),  will be followed up until the SAE  resolves,  based  on investigator’s  medical  judgment  
or are considered to be chronic (stabilized for at least 30 days). For safety reporting instructions  
see SAE  and Pregnancy  Form Report  Instructions. 
17.8. Pregnancy  
At the time, Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_403022] a study patient became  
pregnant following study participation, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_534354]/or by [CONTACT_29658] a completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor  
or its designee  within one  working day of being notified of  the pregnancy  report. 
The report  will include  the following elements:  
• Patient  (mother’s) coded study identifier;  
• Date of  patient’s  last menstrual  period;  
• Total  accumulated  dose  of study treatment administered  to date;  
• Date of  study product  administration.  
The investigator will follow the patient until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the  
outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than [ADDRESS_888304] a  
follow -up Pregnancy Report  with any relevant  information  on the present  condition of the fetus  to 
the Sponsor or  its designee, including:  
• Mother’s  coded  study identifier(s);  
• Gestational  age at  delivery, miscarriage or abortion;  
• Birth  weight, gender, length  and head  circumference,  if available;  
• Apgar  scores  recorded  after  birth, if available;  
• Any abnormalities.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g.,  
spontaneous  or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be  
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the  
event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE report form to the Sponsor  or its designee within  
one working day of being notified of the  pregnancy  report.  
If the trial is completed  before  the outcome  of the pregnancy is known,  the Sponsor  or its designee  
will assume  the responsibility  for following up on the pregnancy. The Sponsor  or its designee  will 
contact [CONTACT_534400] -up on the outcome of pregnancy and will also check on the status of the infant [ADDRESS_888305] assessment  visit (or the Early  Termination  Visit)  must  
be recorded on the  AE eCRF  with the  status of the  AE noted. 
17.9.2. Serious  Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events that are identified on the last assessment visit (or the Early Termination  
Visit)  must  be recorded  on the AE eCRF  page  and reported  to Sol-Gel according  to the procedures  
outlined above. Patients with unresolved previously reported serious adverse events, or any new  
serious  adverse  events  identified  on the last assessment  visit,  should be followed by [CONTACT_436135], or the patient is lost to follow -up. Resolution means the  
patient has returned to the baseline state of health, or the investigator does not expect any further  
improvement or worsening of the adverse event. The investigator should continue to report any  
significant follow -up information to Sol -Gel up to the point that the event has resolved. Any 
serious  adve rse event  reported  by [CONTACT_658541],  and are determined  by [CONTACT_658542], should be  reported to Sol -Gel.

 18. STUDY  PRODUCTS / CLINICAL  SUPPLIES  
18.1. Method of Treatment  Assignment  
Patients who satisfy all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to one  
of two treatment arms.  Randomization will be performed  in the IWRS  according to a computer -
gener ated randomization schedule.  The randomization schedule will be generated by  [CONTACT_534403].  The randomization schedule will  be maintained 
securely within the IWRS. Patients will be randomized to Encapsulated Benzoyl  Peroxide  
Cream, 5%, or  Vehicle Cream, once  daily  on a 2:1 basis for  twelve  (12) weeks.  
Once a patient is determined eligible for the study at the Baseline visit, the patient will be  
randomized to study product assignment by [CONTACT_8784]. Each study product carton will contain 
four pumps  of the same product;  The first supplied pump in each  kit is marked A  (e.g. number  of 
pump within a kit is XXXXA), at Visit 4/ Week 4 the patient will return the pump and will be  
dispensed with the next pump which  is marked  B. At Visit 5/  Week  8, the patient  will be dispensed 
with a pump marked C. The pump marked as D is a backup pump. The patient number will be  
added  to both parts  of the kit label (open part  and tear -off label and to the  pump label).

Weeks  4, [ADDRESS_888310]  weight  will be documented in EDC  prior to dispensing and after 
return  of each pump per flow chart ( Section 13.9 and Section 5.2).  
Each Patient will be instructed on the importance of returning his or her study product at each  
designated visit. If a Patient does not re turn his or her study product, he or she will be instructed  
to return it at the next visit.  
The study coordinator will question the patient on history of study product use since the last visit  
and will record any missed doses (as recorded on the patient di ary) in both the source documents  
and the appropriate eCRF. A patient who deviates significantly from the prescribed dosage will  
be counseled.  
Study  product  should be stored  at room  temperature 20 to 25°C  (68 to 77°F).  Excursions  permitted  
between  15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F). Do not freeze or refrigerate the product.  
18.5. Dosing Instructions  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_658524],  for a period of  twelve  (12) weeks.  Study product  will be  applied as  a thin coating  
that is gently  rubbed in to the skin. 
Each patient will receive both verbal and written instructions (see Appendix 1) as to the proper  
dosing and study product  application techniques.  
Patients  will be instructed  to apply the study product  for 12 weeks, once  a day after cleansing. No 
time interval between dosing  and meals or any  other activity  is specified.  
Patients will cleanse their face with the given cleanser or sponsor approved cleanser using only 
the hands and pat dry with a soft clean towel. Patients will use a “pea -size” amount for each area 
of the face (chin, left cheek,  right  cheek,  nose,  left forehead  and right  forehead).  The Patient  should 
gently rub the cream into the skin. This amount of cream should be sufficient to cover the area on the face excluding the mouth, eyes, inside the nose, and lips. The Patient should wash his/her  
hands after application but should not wash face at least [ADDRESS_888311] 30 minutes  before  applying moisturizer/sunscreen  after application  of 
study product to the face. During the trial that investigators remind patients to avoid exposure to  
sunlight  and sunlamps and to wear sunscreen  when  sun exposure  cannot  be avoided.  
The Patients will be instructed to continue using the same supplied/approved facial cleanser and not to change  products  during the study. At each visit,  Patients  are to be asked  if they have changed  
their cleansing routine. The supplied/approved cleanser and moisturizer/sunscreen should be  
applied according to the directions on the pump. Facial makeup (non -medicated) may be applied  
according to the patient’s normal daily routine (but not prior  to [ADDRESS_888312]  
application); however, patients should be instructed not to apply the moisturizer or sunscreen or  
combination of them or wear make -up during study visits as it may interfere with the evaluator’s  
assessments.  No other products should be used on  the face.  
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  62 of 85  
 Pump usage will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_264715] a sample pump at the clinic to help  
assure the patient understands the procedure. The patient will be provided a set of instructions  
(Appendix 1) that includes study reminders and restrictions as described in this protocol. Patients  
will be instructed to bring the study product to each visit and to not apply study product one hour  
prior  to the study  visit.  Patients  should  be instructed  to store  the study product  at room  
temperature,  not in the refrigerator or freezer  and informed  that the test article  may bleach  colored  
fabric.  
18.6. Study Product  Accountability  and Study Records  at Sites  
Upon receipt of the clinical supplies, the study staff will conduct a complete inventory of study  
products and assume responsibility for their storage and dispensing. In accordance with federal  
regulations, the Investigators  must  agree  to keep  all study products  in a secure,  temperature-
controlled location with restricted  access.  
All supplies  sent to the Investigators  will be accounted  for and in no case used in any unauthorized 
manner.  All used and unused study product will be appropriately inventoried by [CONTACT_977], 
and verified by [CONTACT_24653].  
Study product  will be weighed before  dispensing and upon return  and weights  will be recorded  on 
the appropriate  source document and eCRF.  
18.7. Return  and Destruction  of Study Product  Supplies  
Upon completion or termination of the study, all remaining pumps (in kits) must be appropriately 
inventoried and returned to Sponsor or designee by a traceable method.  All missing pumps of  
study products  must  be explained on the completed  Clinical Supplies  Return  Form.  The study site 
must  keep a copy of the  Clinical Supplies Return  Form  in the  study file. 
18.8. Additional  Supplies  Provided by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Regulatory study file system  (Investigator  Binder)

 19. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
19.1. General  Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® version 9.3 or later unless otherwise  
stated.  Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in  
p-values of 0.05 or  less.  These  methods are  intended to analyze the  results  of the study. 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be based on estimation using the  
method of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) imputation. This method provides robust  
estimation when the pattern of missingness is arbitrary.  Additionally, the estimation will be done  
for each treatment group separately so that the pattern of missingness for one group does not  
influence  the estimation  of missing  data for another  group. Groups  of complete  datasets  following 
the estimation will be concatenated to form analysis datasets for the comparative analyses and  
subsequent  imputation  result  inference with SAS PROC  MIANALYZE.  Descriptive  statistics  will 
also be derived  from the  multiply  imputed datasets.  
Additionally, a model -based multiple imputation process will be used as a sensitivity analysis to  
the MCMC imputation.  Finally, the absolute change in lesion count will be analyzed using a  
repeated measures ANCOV A for lesion count data or a repeated measures logistic regression  
model  (generalized  estimating  equations)  for the  dichotomized  Investigator’s  Global  Assessment,  
IGA.  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate  
document. The SAP will be finalized prior  to unblinding of the  study treatments.  
19.1.1. Patient  Disposition  
A tabulation of patient disposition will be provided. The tabulation will include the numbers of  
patients who enter the study, complete the study, and discontinue the study. The reasons for  
discontinuation will be  included.  
19.1.2. Demographics  and Baseline  Characteristics  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_534404], PP, and safety populations. For continuous variables (e.g. age) comparisons among the two  
treatment groups will be conducted using a two- way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors  
of treatment group and analysis center (see Section 19.4.6 for definition of “analysis center”). 
Ethnicity and race will be analyzed with a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_534405].  Past and current medical conditions, as well as history of disease will be presented in a  
data listing.  
19.1.3. Protocol  Deviations  
All protocol deviations will be reported to the sponsor and recorded throughout the study. A 
tabulation  of protocol deviations will be presented in a data listing.  
19.1.4. Analysis  Populations  
Approximately [ADDRESS_888313]  18 years of age with moderate or severe  
papulopustular rosacea with 3 or 4 [moderate to severe] on the IGA scale will be enrolled and  
randomized  in the  study with a  2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page  64 of 85  
 • 234 patients will be randomized to receive S5G4T -1, Encapsulated Benzoyl Peroxide  (E-
BPO)  Cream, 5%  
• [ADDRESS_888314] -baseline safety  evaluation.  
An intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis will be conducted on all study patients. A per-protocol (PP)  
analysis will also be conducted. Patients will be eligible for the PP analysis if they complete the  
12-week evaluation without noteworthy study protocol violations (i.e., any patient or investigator  
activity that could have possibly inter fered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or  
the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy).  The PP population will include patients in the ITT  
population who do not meet any of the following criteria:  
• Failed  any of the  inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Have taken any  interfering  concomitant medications; 
• Did not attend the  Week  12 Visit;  
• Missed  more  than [ADDRESS_888315] baseline  study visit prior  to Week 12  
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., Patients may not miss more than  
five consecutive days of dosing and must take 80 to 120% of expected doses. The number  
of expected  doses  will be determined  for each patient  based  on the length of their 
participation  in the study);  
• Out of visit window (± 4 days) at  the 12-week  Visit.  
Patients that discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or  
documented lack of treatment  effect  will be included  in the PP population. Data for  these subjects  
will not be imputed by [CONTACT_534406]. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional  
criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the  
conduct of the  trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations.  
19.2. Study Product  Evaluations  and  Analyses  
Inflammatory lesion count will be recorded for each patient at the Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8

19.4. Statistical Hypothesis  Testing  
19.4.1. Test of Superiority  for Lesion  Count  Variables  
This section provides the basic model and statistical approach which is used in combination with 
the multiple imputation procedures described in Section 19.4.6. Tests of superiority for the  
absolute change from Baseline in inflammatory lesions will be based on non- parametric methods  
consistent with the statistical assumptions required to support the analyses. Specifically, the tests  
of superiority will be based on ranked data submitted to an ANCOVA with factors of treatment  
and analysis center and the respective Baseline lesion  count as a  covariate.  
For informational  purposes, a skewness  test, based  on the  methods  presented  by [CONTACT_85215] 1984, will be  
applied  to the residuals  resulting  from  an ANCOVA using the untransformed  lesion  count  data. A 
two-sided  p-value  for the skewness  test significant  at 0.[ADDRESS_888317] of Superiority  for IGA  
The IGA will be dichotomized  into “success” and “failure” with a patient  considered a success  for 
those visits if the Investigator’s Global Assessment is at least 2 grades less than Baseline and  
“Clear” or “Almost Clear”.  The analysis of the dichotomized IGA will be based on a logistic  
regression  test w ith factors of  treatment group and analysis  center.  
19.4.3. Test of Superiority  for Secondary  Efficacy  and Control  of Multiplicity  
Appropriate  descriptive  statistics  will be computed for all Secondary Efficacy  parameters.  
Additionally, all inferential testing will follow the methods for the primary lesion count analyses  
as well as those  for the  dichotomized IGA success  rates (as  appropriate).  
The overall Type I error will be controlled by [CONTACT_534407]- primary efficacy endpoints to  
be statistically  significant.  Specifically,  failure  of either  one of the primary  efficacy  endpoints  will 
invalidate  the statistical significance  of the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints. 
SGT -54-02, Ver 4.[ADDRESS_888318] for a step is not significant.  All subsequent tests  
for the remaining steps will be considered not significant. The order of testing is provided in  
Table 6.

19.4.4. Supportive  Efficacy  Analyses  
Appropriate  descriptive  statistics  will be computed for all Supportive  Efficacy  parameters.  
Additionally, inferential testing for the following endpoints will use an ANOVA with factors of  
treatment, analysis center and the respective Baseline score. The overall Type I error will be 
controlled by [CONTACT_492171]- Hochberg method. Missing values will not  be imputed. 
• Mean  change comparison  in PAPSS item 1 (burning)  between  groups  from  Baseline to 
Week 12  
• Mean  change comparison  in PAPSS item 2 (itching)  between  groups  from  Baseline to

 19.4.6. Pooling Analysis  
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with  
the intention of pooling the data for a nalysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in 
study execution at each investigational site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner  
such that a minimum of 5 patients will be enrolled in each treatment arm for any investigator.  In 
the event  that there  are too few patients  in a treatment  arm for an investigator, then this 
investigator's data will be combined to achieve the desired sample size minimum per arm.  The 
combining of investigator's data will be accomplished by [CONTACT_658544].  If there is a further 
need  to combine  data,  then the data of the investigator  with the second  smallest  enrollment  will be 
combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment and so on. This 
process  will continue  for all  investigators  who did not have  a minimum of [ADDRESS_888319] insufficient patients per treatment arm  
will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of statistical analyses. These  
combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses based on  
ANCOVA and stratified  logistic testing.  
Prior to investigating the treatment effect within the analysis centers, the magnitude of the site  
mail effect  will be  investigated  to determine  if the main  site-to-site variability  is such that it could  
mask the analysis center effects.  Thus, if computationally possible, a one -way ANCOVA (for  
lesion count variables) or a logistic regression analysis (for IGA) with a factor of site will be  
conducted prior  to pooling. If the data structure  interferes  with the logistic  regression, a descriptive  
analysis of the site effect will be undertaken.  Conclusions appropriate to the findings of this step  
will be  presented.  
The consistency of treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers subsequent  
to combining the data as described above.  Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there  
are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common statistical and clinical  
conclusions. An analysis center by [CONTACT_534409] 0.10.  Change from baseline in  
inflammatory lesions will be analyzed with an ANCOVA (unranked or ranked) with factors of  
treatment,  analysis  center,  and treatment  by [CONTACT_658545] a covariate.  For the purpose  of testing  consistency  of treatment  response, 
the dichotomized IGA will be analyzed with a logistic regression procedure with factors of  
treatment, analysis center, and treatment by [CONTACT_85219].  Further examination will  
follow for any variables that have a significant ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction term. In the event that the ANCOVA or logistic regression interaction (referred to henceforth as the  
"appropriate  test")  p-value  is less than or equal  to 0.10, a sensitivity  analysis  that excludes  analysis  
centers with the extreme efficacy result will be performed to determine the robustness of the  
treatment effect.  On the other hand, if the outcome of the appropriate test has a p -value greater  
than 0.10, then the conclusions  from  the pooled data will be considered to be  free of the impact  of 
extreme analysis centers.  
The first step in conducting a sensitivity analysis is to identify the extreme analysis center or  
centers that contribute to the statistical significance of the appropriate test.  The process involves  
submitting subsets of analysis centers to the appropriate test and observing the appropriate test  p-
value for the subset. Subse ts with p -values greater than 0.[ADDRESS_888320]-hoc aspects  of the process  will be given  when  the results  are interpreted. Conclusions  will be 
presented  by [CONTACT_658546].  
19.4.7. Missing  Efficacy  Data  Imputations  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lesion  Count Variable  Missing  Data  Imputation  
Missing Week 12 data will be estimated by [CONTACT_85221].  
Missing  lesion  count  data will be derived  for the analysis  using the method of Markov Chain  Monte  
Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group  
cannot  influence  the missing  value  estimation  in the other  because the imputation  will be 
conducted independently  for each treatment group. 
Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis will involve [ADDRESS_888321] phases with these principal  
tasks:  
1. Create  a data set  of patients,  one for each  treatment group, with observed values  and those  
needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing lesion count values in each data set will be  
filled in using the MCMC method 5 times to generate 5 data sets.  The resulting data sets  
for each treatment arm will be combined into one complete data set for each imputation.

[IP_ADDRESS]. IGA Missing  Data  Imputation  
A similar procedure will be used for the analyses based on proportion of IGA successes wherein 
the ANCOVA analysis is replaced with a logistic regression analysis.  Specifically, missing 12  
week IGA values from which the dichotomized IGA is derived will be estimated by (MCMC).  
The pattern of missing observations in each treatment group cannot influence the missing value  
estimation  in the other  because the imputation  is being conducted independently for each treatment 
group. 
The missing 12- week IGA values will be derived for the analysis using the method of Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation.  Multiple imputation and subsequent analysis  
will involve  4 principal tasks:  
1. Create  a data set,  one for each  treatment group, of  patients  with observed  values  and those  
needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing IGA values in each data set will be filled in

19.4.8. Sensitivity  Efficacy  Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity  Analyses  for Absolute  Change  in Lesion  Count  
The first sensitivity analysis for absolute change in lesion count will use a repeated measures  
ANCOVA,  with treatment,  analysis  center,  and visit (i.e., Weeks 2,  4 and 8) as independent  factors  
and a covariate of baseline lesion  count. In this analysis, data  from  all post-baseline visits  will be 
included with no imputation for missing data.  
The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based multiple imputation method to impute  
missing  data for the absolute  change  in lesion  counts  at Week 12. Although the full details  will be 
presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the multiple imputation will involve 4 principal  
tasks:  
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 complete data sets.  The imputation  
model used will be an ANCOVA with factors of treatment group and analysis center, and 
a covariate of baseline lesion count (i.e., the imputation model will be the same as the  
analysis model). Appropriate modifications will be made should the analysis be based on  
a non-parametric method.  
2. Each  complete  data set will be analyzed  with an ANCOVA with factors  of treatment  group,  
and analysis center, and  a covariate of  baseline lesion  count.  
3. Results  from  these analyses  will be  combined into  a single  inference.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sensitivity  Analyses  for IGA 
The first sensitivity analysis for the dichotomized IGA success will use a repeated measures  
logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with dichotomized IGA success as  
the dependent variable and treatment, a nalysis  center,  and visit (i.e., Weeks 2, 4 and 8) as  
independent factors.  In this analysis, data from all post -baseline visits will be included with no  
imputation for  missing  data.

 The second sensitivity analysis will use the model based mul tiple imputation method to impute  
missing data for the dichotomized IGA data. Although the full details will be presented in the  
SAP,  the multiple imputation will involve 4 principal tasks:  
1. Missing values will be filled in 5 times to generate 5 complete data sets.  The imputation  
model  used logistic  regression with factors  of treatment  group and analysis  center  (i.e., the 
imputation  model will be  the same as the analysis model).  
2. Each complete data set will be analyzed with a logistic regression a factors of treatment  
group and analysis center. 
3. Results  from  these analyses  will be  combined into  a single  inference.  
19.4.9. Subgroup Analyses  
Subset analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the subgroups baseline global  
severity, gende r, age, ethnicity, race, and geographic region. Age will be dichotomized to less  
than the median age of patients and greater than or equal to the median age of patients. Subset  
analyses  will be conducted on the variables  absolute  change from  baseline in inflammatory  lesions  
at Week 12 as well as the dichotomized global severity score at Week 12.  These analyses will  
contain only descriptive  statistics.  
19.5. Assessment  of Safety  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_220131] (AEs), Cutaneous Safety Assessments  
for dryness and scaling, assessments for scores (erythema and telangiectasia) and Patient Global  
Impression of Treatment Side -Effects (PGI -SE) will be presented with descriptive statistics at  
Baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_888324]  
usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. All reported treatment- emergent AEs  
(TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_534412], system organ class,  
severity,  seriousness, and  relationship  to study product. TEAEs  are those  AEs  with an onset  on or

Serious  adverse events  (SAEs) will  be tabulated  by [CONTACT_534418]. 
In addition, a list of patients  who discontinued from  the study and a list of patients  who experienced  
SAEs  will also be provided. 
19.6.1. Vital  Sign  Measurements  
Vital signs as well as changes from Baseline in vital sign measurements will be summarized with  
descriptive  statistics for  each treatment group at  all applicable study visits.  
19.6.2. Concomitant  Medications  
All previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_534357].  Previous  therap ies and concomitant  medications  data will be presented

19.7. Sample  Size Determination  
The following power  calculations  are based  on the observed  Week  12 results  of the Phase 2 study,  
SGT -EBP01 -09. This study was a three -arm trial including E -BPO Cream, 1% and 5%, and  
Vehicle in the Treatment  of Rosacea.  Estimates  from  the E-BPO  Cream,  5% arm were  used in the 
power  assessments.  The anticipated  randomization ratio is 2:1 for E-BPO  Cream,  5% and Vehicle,  
respectively.  The computations  were performed  with nQuery  Advisor  Version 7.[ADDRESS_888325] with a  statistical significance  value  of 0.05. 
A sample size of 86 in the E -BPO Cream, 5% and 43 in the Vehicle has group has 95% power to 
detect  a statistically  significant  difference in the proportion of patients  who have  at least a 2-grade  
reduction at Week [ADDRESS_888326]  
Clear  are 53.3%  and 20.0%  for the E -BPO Cream  and Vehicle,  respectively.  
A sample size of 200 in the E -BPO Cream, 5% and 100 in the Vehicle group has 95% power to 
detect  a statistically  significant  difference in inflammatory  lesions. The estimated  absolute  change 
from  baseline in  treatment  means  were  -14.[ADDRESS_888327] deviation of 6.70 and 17.24, respectively.  
The sample  sizes  above  will be increased  to give a planned  enrollment  of 234 in the E-BPO  Cream,

 20.5. Electronic  Case Report  Forms  (eCRF)/Source Documents  
Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) called also electronic data capture (EDC) system, will be  
used for recording all data from source documents for each patient. Source documents are the 
point  of first entry for  all data collected.  Whenever  possible, an original  recording  of an 
observation should be  retained as source document. 
The investigator  will ensure  that the eCRFs  are properly and completely  filled  in. The eCRFs  must  
be completed for all patients who have signed an informed consent form. The eCRFs will be  
monitored against source documents. If data in the eCRF is not duplicated in a source document, 
a source  document  should be created  and maintained  by [CONTACT_534419].  Source  
documentation for patients includes but is not limited to the physician’s patient records, diaries,  
photographs. All source  documents will be maintained at the  study site. 
The Investigator or delegate may enter corrections in the eCRFs, which will create an auditable 
history of all changes and by [CONTACT_264730]. The final eCRF will be approved by [CONTACT_658548].  
20.6. Reports  to the IRB/Ethics  Committee  (EC)  
Before  study initiation,  the investigator  must  have  written  and dated  approval  from  the IRB for the 
protocol, consent  form,  patient  recruitment  materials  /process  (e.g.,  advertisements),  and any other  
written information to be provided to patient. The investigator should also provide the IRB with  
a copy of the Investigator’s Brochure and/or package insert. The investigator should provide the  
IRB with reports, updates, and other information (e.g., safety updates, protocol amendments, and administrative  letters) according  to regulatory  requirements  or Institution procedures.

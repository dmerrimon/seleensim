1 1. OBJECTIVES 
 
We hypothesize that patients in the meloxicam group (G-CSF + meloxicam) will have higher 
numbers of CD34+ cells (above 1.5 fold) in the apheresis product collected on the first day, will 
require fewer apheresis sessions to achieve  4 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for multiple myeloma 
patients and > 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for lymphoma patients compared to patients in G-CSF + 
placebo group and will have faster neutrophil and platelet engraftment compared to patients transplanted with HSC graft mobilized with G-CSF + placebo. 
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_889153] will be randomized to  receive G-CSF + placebo (Arm A) or G-CSF 
+ meloxicam (Arm B) for their stem cell mobilization.  Patients who will have <10/ l CD34+ cells 
in the peripheral blood will be declared as “poor  mobilizers” and be rescued with Plerixafor and 
G-CSF. 
 
1.2 Primary Objectives 
 
1. Determine if meloxicam in conjunction with G-CSF leads to increased numbers of circulating 
CD34+ cells on the first day of apheresis compared to G-CSF + placebo.  
 
2. Determine how many apheresis sessions are required to collect  4 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg 
for multiple myeloma patients and > 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for lymphoma patients in the G-
CSF + meloxicam group compared to the G-CSF group.

3.  To evaluate transfusion support (number of red blood cells and platelet transfusions needed prior to red blood cell and platelet engraftment).  4.  Proportion of patients failing stem cell mobilization. 
 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
 
2.1 Rationale 
 
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation plays an important role in the treatment of many hematologic malignancies and some pediatric cancers.  The utility of current mobilization regimens which use cytokines (G-CSF) after chemotherapy (chemomobilization) or cytokine(s) (e.g. G-CSF) alone, is limited by [CONTACT_659073]34+

2 cells in up to 40% of selected patient population.  Plerixafor (AMD 3100, a CXCR4 antagonist) 
in combination with G-CSF has recently been used as a rescue with (second) successful 
mobilization of HSC in approximately 63% of thes e patients, which still leaves a large number of 
patients without an adequate HSC graft for their potentially curative autologous HSC transplantation.  In addition, current strategies have differing HSC yields, safety considerations, resource utilization and costs.  Novel agents are clearly needed that will adequately mobilize HSC with  few or no toxicities, thereby [CONTACT_144885].  Here, we propose to 
demonstrate that oral meloxicam, an inexpensive, well-tolerated, and widely available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can be  a safe and effective stem cell mobilizing agent.  
Recently, we have shown in a mouse model that meloxicam increases egress of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and the phenotypic HSC-enriched populations Sca-1
+ c-Kit+ lineage- 
(SKL) or the highly purified CD150+ CD48- (SLAM) SKL populations [Nature in press].  When 
baboons were mobilized with a standard clinical regimen of G-CSF, or the combination of G-CSF + meloxicam, in all cases meloxicam resulted in increased numbers of circulating CD34
+ 
cells compared to G-CSF alone, and in addition, meloxicam treatment on its own also resulted 
in significant HSC/HPC mobilization.  In healthy human volunteers, short-term meloxicam treatment resulted in significant increases in CD34
+ cells.  The inhibition of PGE2 signaling 
which is an important positive regulator of HSC CXCR4 and HSC homing to the niche, appears to be one (reduced CXCR4 levels) of the main mechanisms of NSAID-induced HSC 
mobilization and this is a cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway specific effect. Staggered 
administration of meloxicam and G-CSF allowed for restored CXCR4 levels but maintaining enhanced HSC mobilization and, in transplantation models HSC grafts collected this way resulted in significant enhancement in hematopoietic engraftment. Meloxicam inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 and when compared to other dual inhibitors it has much less inhibition of platelet aggregation.  In this proposal, we will address the hypothesis that oral meloxicam - an 
inexpensive, well-tolerated, and widely availabl e non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), 
can be a safe and effective stem cell mobilizing agent.  These studies have the potential to lead 
to the establishment of a novel drug, that is widely available, affordable, easy to administer, 
safe, yet effective in predictably mobilizing CD34+ cells for both autologous and allogeneic HSC transplantation. 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Factors limiting clinical AHSCT.   Autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation 
(AHSCT) provides hematopoietic support after high dose chemotherapy and is the standard of 
care for patients with multiple myeloma, chemosensitive relapsed/refractory Hodgkin’s disease, high- or intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) and relapsed/refractory germ cell 
tumor [1-3].  AHSCT is also used as a salvage treatment in follicular lymphoma and recent data 
suggest that more than10-year disease-free survival is possible after high-dose chemotherapy 
and AHSCT [4].  In addition, AHSCT may lead to long-term progression-free survival in patients with mantle cell lymphoma, when used as part of front-line treatment in first remission [5].  The numbers of CD34+ cells play an important role in the success of AHSCT.  Higher HSC doses 
are associated with faster neutrophil (>0.5 x 10
9/l) and faster platelet engraftment (plt count >20 x 
109/l) and reduction in the need of supportive measures such as blood product transfusions and 
prophylactic antibiotics [6, 7].  Other factors that influence the HSC mobilization and, therefore, the 
success of AHSCT include patient age, gender, degree of exposure to previous chemotherapy and irradiation, disease characteristics such as bone marrow involvement and previous 
mobilization attempts [8].  Unsuccessful initial HSC mobilization often leads to expensive 
additional mobilization attempts and may preclude ASHCT altogether [9-12].   
NSAIDs to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells   
 September 28, [ADDRESS_889155] common HSC mobilization regimens use cytokines (G-CSF) alone or 
cytokines (G-CSF) after chemotherapy (chemomobilization).  While cytokine alone can mobilize adequate HSC, the addition of a myelosuppressive chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_659074] a factor of 2.5 [11] and can reduce the number of 
apheresis required for targeted HSC collection.  The use of chemotherapy in chemomobilization is associated with variable rates of complications due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and, therefore leads to increased resource use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], transfusions and the use of antibiotic therapy [13, 14].  In addition, the variation in chemotherapeutics and individual responses to chemomobilization often results in unpredictable/irregular collection schedules that increase 
resource utilization [15]. Current HSC mobilization regimens also have high fa ilure rates, failing to 
mobilize sufficient HSC to proceed to AHSCT in 5-30% of patients, necessitating additional 
mobilization attempts or preclu ding transplantation [16, 17]. 
 Biology of HSC Mobilization. There has been significant recent advances in specific cellular 
and molecular mechanisms governing the interactions between HSC and BM microenvironment, i.e., HSC/niche interactions. The HSC niche is represented by [CONTACT_166851], endothelial cells, osteoblasts and other matrix components such as collagens, fibronectins and proteoglycans.  HSCs express a variety of ce ll surface receptors, specifically adhesion 
molecules, namely lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1 (LFA-1), very late Ag-4 (VLA-4) and 
Mac-1, the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR2, the cell surface glycoproteins CD44 and 
CD62L and the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit [18, 19]. The BM stroma contains stromal cell-
derived factor-1 (SDF-1), CXC chemokine GRO- , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-
1), kit ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and hyaluronic acid, all of which are 
ligands for HSC adhesion molecules/receptors [18, 19].  Inhibition of these receptor-ligand 
interactions results in HSC and HPC egress from the bone marrow [20, 21].  Human 
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and their precursors, including the majority of HSCs, express the CD34 antigen, despi[INVESTIGATOR_659054]34- cells may have multilineage reconstitution capacity [22, 23].  Therefore, the CD34 surface marker is commonly used as a marker for HSC/HPC collection.  The target dose of CD34+ cells ranges from a 
minimum of 2.0 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg to an optimal dose of 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg [12, 24-26].  
The numbers of CD34+ cells are positively correlated with the pace of neutrophil and platelet 
engraftment following AHSCT.  Higher CD34+ cell doses are more beneficial for patients with myeloma and NHL, with a few studies reporting im provement in overall survival in myeloma 
patients [27, 28].  
 
G-CSF. Under G-CSF stimulation, myeloid cells release active neutrophil serine proteases 
cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase along with stromal metalloproteinase-9.  This results in 
cleavage/degradation of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1, c-kit, CXCR4 and SDF-1 and in release of CD34+ cells [29-32].  G-CSF is the most commonly used HSC mobilizing agent.  When G-CSF alone is used for mobilization of CD34+ cells, it is given at doses varying from 10 
ug/kg s.c. daily to 32 ug/kg s.c. daily, beginning at least [ADDRESS_889156] apheresis session (Neupogen, filgrastim [package insert]. [COMPANY_010] Inc.: Thousand Oaks, CA, 1991-2006) [32].  In many patients with myeloma and malignant lymphoma, mobilization with G-CSF al one results in suboptimal CD34+ cell yields, 
with “mobilization failures”, defined as CD34+ cell yields of <2 x 10
6/kg, in up to 30% of patients.  
Moskowitz et al reported that G-CSF mobilization alone yielded significantly fewer CD34+ cells and was inferior to mobilization with chemotherapy + G-CSF (1.5 x 10
6/kg vs. 6.7 x 106/kg) [33].  
 G-CSF with chemotherapy. It has been speculated that treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY) and G-CSF have a synergistic effect on protease release in marrow microenvironment, because when administered individually, both CY and G-CSF enhance the release of neutrophil 
NSAIDs to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells   
 September 28, [ADDRESS_889157] the adhesion molecules CXCR4, SDF-1 and c-kit [34]. Besides CY, some 
of the other chemotherapeutics chosen from the salvage regimens, that are used in conjunction 
with G-CSF for HSC mobiliozation are ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatinum, etoposide), high-dose 
cytarabine, DHAP and ESHAP (etoposide, cytarabine, methylyprednisolone and cisplatinum), 
etc.  Salvage chemotherapy followed by G-CSF is widely used for mobilization of CD34+ cells because the addition of suppression of the bone marrow to G-CSF results in higher HSC yields with fewer apheresis sessions needed to collect the targeted CD34+ cell dose, which may result in better patient outcomes [35, 36].  While chemotherapy has been noted to reduce the risk of tumor-contaminated cell collections, it has not been proven yet that the cytoreductive effects of 
chemomobilization confer any survival benefit to the patients [37, 38].  
 
The effect of chemomobilization is highly variable and CD34+ cell egress peaks 10-18 days after administration of chemotherapy which generally correlates with rebound of white cell count after a chemotherapy-induced nadir [39].  Following chemomobilization, the length of time 
before the number of CD34+ cells peaks differs substantially between patients resulting in 
unpredictable collection schedules [11, 15, 40].  White cell and CD34+ cell counts, on occasions, must be monitored over the course of many days to determine when to initiate the collection.  Besides, the gains of adding chemot herapy to a G-CSF mobilization regimen may be 
offset by [CONTACT_659075], including higher risk of infection, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], 
the need for transfusion and antibiotic therapy, greater resource utilization with considerably 
higher cost overall [13, 35]. 
 
Plerixafor (AMD 3100). AMD 3100 is a selective and reversible inhibitor of CXCR4 and disrupts 
its interaction with SDF-1, thereby [CONTACT_659076] [41].  Plerixafor in 
combination with G-CSF has been shown to predictably enhance the numbers of circulating 
CD34+ cells [compared to G-CSF alone group, median increase of 4.4 fold in lymphoma 
patients and 3- to 3.5 fold in myeloma patients] [42]. In a study on poor mobilizers, collections of 
 2x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg after administration of G-CSF (10 g/kg s.c. daily, with apheresis 
initiated on day 5, continued until the collection is complete or declared “failed”) and plerixafor 
(240 g/kg s.c. daily, beginning on the evening of day 4, continued every evening until collection 
is complete or declared “failed”) were achieved in 60.3% of patients with NHL, 71.4% of patients 
with myeloma and 76.5% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma [43].  Perixafor is establishing its recognition as a potential HSC mobilizing agent.  However, this is an expensive drug, needs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_659055], nausea, 
vomiting and injection-site erythema/edema.  
PRELIMINARY STUDIES:  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_659056]/niche interactions, little is understood about regulatory function within the intact mammalian hematopoietic niche. Recently, we and others described a positive 
regulatory role for the lipid mediator 
Prostaglandin E
2 (PGE 2) on HSC function 
ex vivo  [44,45]. However, to date, the 
function of PGE 2 produced endogenously 
in mammalian niches in regulation of 
hematopoiesis is unknown. Given the 
known roles of PGE 2 on HSC and the 
abundance of clinically used compounds 
that alter PGE 2 signaling, particularly 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we sought to determine the

5 role of endogenous PGE 2 on systemic niche-HSC regulation.  
NSAIDs increase hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell egress   
Mice were treated with the prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_659058] (50 g/mouse) for 
4 days to reduce endogenous PGE 2 
production. Treatment resulted in a 
significant increase in hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in peripheral blood [46] (Figure 1a), that was not 
accompanied by [CONTACT_659077] (not shown), which likely accounts for lack of previous detection of this observation despi[INVESTIGATOR_659059]. No increase in HPC egress was seen in 
mice treated with the lipoxygenase 
inhibitor baicalein (Figure 1a), 
suggesting a cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway specific effect. When indomethacin was co-administered with the clinically used mobilizi ng agent granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-
CSF), significant enhancement (~2 fold) in HPC mobilization resulted (Figure 1a, right panel). 
NSAIDs with varying COX-1- and COX-2-selectivity demonstrated significant mobilization with 
indomethacin, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], ibuprofen, and meloxicam (Figure 1b). Meloxicam inhibits both COX-1 
and COX-2 within the bone marrow microenvironment and when compared to other dual inhibitors it has a reduced incidence of gastrointes tinal discomfort [47] and inhibition of platelet 
aggregation [48]. Therefore, meloxicam was used in the majority of the described studies below, and is our choice for clinical study in this proposal. Meloxicam, similar to indomethacin, 
increased egress of HPC  (Figure 2, left panel) and the phenotypic HSC-enriched populations 
Sca-1
+ c-kit+ lineage- (SKL) or the highly purified CD150+ CD48- (SLAM) SKL populations 
(Figure 2, right panel). 
 
Enhanced hematopoietic engraftment with G-CSF + NSAID mobilized grafts   W e  t h e n  
explored the hematopoietic engraftment potential of an NSAID-mobilized graft.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_659060], two early attempts at transplant did not show a significant effect on HSC engraftment (data not shown). Since we had previously shown that PGE
2 signaling was an important positive regulator of HSC CXCR4 
expression and HSC homing to the niche 1, we hypothesized that while there was an increase in 
HSC/HPC yield in NSAID grafts, CXCR4 expression might be reduced, accounting for apparent lack of enhancement in engraftment. To test this hypothesis we used a simple treatment regimen modification, staggering the administration of NSAID and G-CSF to allow for hematopoietic mobilization and restoration of normal endogenous PGE
2 signaling pathways 
before transplant (Figure 3a).  As hypothesized, CXCR4 levels were significantly lower on G-CSF mobilized HSC/HPC after NSAID treatmen t, while staggered administration allowed for 
restored receptor levels (Figure 3b), while maintaining enhanced HSC mobilization (Figure 3c).  Using these novel dosing strategies, we competitively transplanted mobilized grafts from G-CSF-mobilized mice, or non-staggered and staggered G-CSF + meloxicam treated mice.  Staggered NSAID administration along with G-CSF resulted in a significant enhancement in LT-HSC engraftment as measured by [CONTACT_659078] G-CSF + NSAID mobilized graft (Figure 3d).  In addition to long-term engraftment, early recovery of blood cell counts, particularly neutrophils and platelets, is important to reduce the duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia associated with Figure 1 .

7 peripheral blood. In addition, as seen in mice, meloxicam treatment on its own resulted in 
significant HSC/HPC mobilization compared to baseline levels (Figures 5 d,e).  In healthy human volunteers, short-term meloxicam treatment resulted in significant increases in CD34
+ 
cells (Figure 5f), determined using the ISHAGE procedure [53], and functionally defined HPC (Figures 5 g, h and i), matching hematopoietic egress seen with meloxicam treatment in baboons and mice. Thus, short-term endogenous PGE
2 inhibition, closely resembling current 
clinical NSAID treatment, results in a previously unappreciated increase in stem and progenitor 
cells in the peripheral blood.

8 macrophage progenitor cells 
(GMP) with HSC showed enhanced reconstitution of tissue 
myeloid cells and protection from 
fungal and bacterial infections [58], and  significantly improved survival in mice receiving lethal doses of radiation [59]. Therefore, not only are the absolute numbers 
of CD34+ cells important in 
determining post-transplant outcome, but the functional repertoire of stem and progenitor cells, as well as their mature 
counterparts, also substantially 
contribute.  We have recently demonstrated that treatment with NSAIDs alone or in combination 
with G-CSF results in an increase in functionally defined myeloid progenitors both in bone marrow and in peripheral blood (preliminary data and [46]). Intriguingly, morphologic and microscopic analysis of myeloid hematopoietic colonies from mice mobilized with G-CSF vs. G-
CSF plus NSAIDs showed a marked shift in multi-centric and monocytic colony formation 
(Figure 6), with many colonies exceeding the field of view (40X) in size (not shown). Histological analysis revealed that these colonies were pr imarily monocytic, and are highly reminiscent of 
multipotent, high proliferative potential colony forming cells (HPP-CFC) [60].

demonstrated an 
increase in CFU-GM in bone marrow following NSAID treatment,

qualitatively more robust 
progenitor population was mobilized by [CONTACT_244402]. To answer this question we performed extensive functional and

analysis of bone marrow of control vs. NSAID treated mice [46] (Figure 7). The striking findings Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells

9 were 1) phenotypic analysis showed no increase in SLAM SKL (highly purified LT-HSC), 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_659064], or phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_659065]-erythroid progenitors (MEP), with a ~2-fold increase in phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_659066]; 2) flow cytometry sorted GMP from NSAID 
treated mice showed 2-fold enhanced colony formation on an equal cell number basis compared to GMP from control mice (Figure 7g,h), and in addition, 3) flow cytometry sorted 
CMP from NSAID treated mice showed 2-fold enhanced colony formation on an equal cell number basis compared to control CMP (Figur e 7d,e). These data clearly demonstrate that 
NSAIDs increase the proliferative potential or  proliferative program of both CMP and GMP, 
resulting in the mobilization of a qualitatively different progenitor subset. In our patient 
populations mobilized with meloxicam, we hypothesize that the CD34+ cells will be qualitatively 
different than those mobilized with G-CSF + placebo.

 September 28, [ADDRESS_889172] apheresis will be regarded as day 0.  Patients in whom the 
numbers of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood are <10/ul, will be declared as 
“poor mobilizers” and they will be rescued with plerixafor.  
The patients will be randomized into two main arms as follows ( A & B).  There will 
also be further randomization according to the type of the disease, i.e., malignant lymphoma vs. multiple myeloma. 
 
A.  G-CSF Alone (+ placebo):
  Patients in this group will receive G-CSF 10 ug/kg s.c. 
daily, beginning [ADDRESS_889173] apheresis [days -4, -3, -2, -1] and continued on 
daily G-CSF for a total of 4 apheresis or until   4 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for multiple 
myeloma patients or > 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for lymphoma patients are collected.  
They will also receive oral placebo for [ADDRESS_889174] 
cyclophosphomide on day -12.   B.  G-CSF + meloxicam:
  Patients in this group will be treated with meloxicam and G-CSF in an 
approximate two-day staggered dose schedule as described in our preclinical studies.  Meloxicam will be given orally at a dose of 15 mg/ day for 5 days (days -6 through -2).  G-CSF at 
10 ug/kg/day subcutaneously will be started on day -4 and continued daily for a total of 4 
apheresis or until   4 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for multiple myeloma or >
2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg 
for lymphoma patients are collected. Multiple myeloma patients opting for mobilization with 
cyclophosphomide will have cyclophos phomide on day -12.     
 
Any patient in any of the above groups who has <10/ul circulating CD34+ cells on day 0 
(poor mobilizer) will be started on daily (eveni ng) plerixafor at 240 ug/kg/day s.c. as a 
rescue, will undergo apheresis on day +1 if circulating CD34+ cells are  10/ul and be 
continued on daily G-CSF + plerixafor for a total of 4 apheresis or until  4 x 10^6 CD34+ 
cells/kg are collected for multiple myeloma patients and > 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for 
lymphoma patients.  Patients who have < 10/ L CD34+ cells on day +1 after the plerixafor 
on day 0 will come off the study.  
     
5.1 Agent Administration  
 
 
5.1.1 Meloxicam: Patients will receive meloxicam 15 mg by [CONTACT_346041] 5 days on 
days -6 through -2.  Please see below “safety concerns of meloxicam”.  
 
5.1.2 G-CSF(Neupogen, Granix, filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim): Patients will receive G-CSF 
10 ug/kg/day S.C. The dose of G-CSF is based on actual body weight. The dose of G-CSF may be rounded as follows:  Patients < 65 kg, receive 600 mcg, patients ≥ 
65<80 kg, receive 780 mcg, patients ≥ 80<96 kg, receive 900 mcg, patients ≥ 
96<110 kg, receive 1080 mcg, patients ≥110kg receive 1200 mcg. The G-CSF is 
used to mobilize stem cells. G-CS F is commercially available.  
5.1.3 Placebo: Patients in Arm A will receive or al placebo for 5 days on days -6 through -
2. 
5.1.4 Cyclophosphamide: Optional and only for multiple myeloma patients. Patients will 
receive cyclophosphamide 2000 mg/m2 intravenously once a day for stem cell

6.1 Anticipated Toxicities 
  
Meloxicam: 
 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been 
associated with adverse effects such as peptic ulcers, gastritis, and 
bleeding.  Meloxicam is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), inhibiting this enzyme with approximately six times the 
potency of COX-1.  Originally approved in 2000, meloxicam has a 
long track record and a favorable side effect profile.  Trials in healthy volunteers showed that this agent did not prolong the bleeding time or affect platelet aggregation in contrast to other NSAIDs tested such as nabumetone and indomethacin [69,70].  Data from these studies 
suggest that even at supratherapeutic doses, meloxicam shows 
relatively low inhibition of thromboxane A2, the eicosanoid that is responsible for platelet aggregation and maintenance of the bleeding time.  With regard to the potential gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs, these almost always occur in the context prolonged use at high doses ; as we will be using the standard dose of meloxicam for 
a total of [ADDRESS_889178] one large-scale cohort study that followed 13,000 patients on meloxicam for three months found only a 0.8% rate of GI adverse events [71] 
 
G-CSF: 
Rare anaphylactic reactions with the first dose; bone pain at sites of active 
marrow with continued administration. Local reactions at injection sites. Constitutional symptoms, increased alkaline phosphatase, LDH, uric acid; worsening of pre-existing inflammatory conditions. Please refer to the package insert for a complete listing of all toxicities.

days on days -6 through -2.  Please see below “safety concerns of meloxicam”.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Availability: Meloxicam tablets are commercially available and will be used in the compounding of meloxicam capsules.  Pharmacy will be ensuring the 
blinding and distributing of both placebo and study drug (meloxicam) 
among the participating patients. "Blinding" will ensure accurate assessments of the toxicities of the "s tudy drug" arm [G-CSF + meloxicam].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation: Meloxicam will be compounded into a capsule formation in order to ensure the blind.  Missed and/or vomited doses should not be made up.  Meloxicam can be taken with or without food.  Capsules should 
be swallowed whole and not crushed, chewed or dissolved.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration: oral 
 
7.1.2 Placebo: In arm A, patients will receive placebo by [CONTACT_346041] 5 days on Days -6 through -2. 
 
Study staff will provide pharmacy with a fund number to purchase and blind study 
drug.  The compounding pharmacy will blind active drug and provide a 
matching placebo.  The placebo will be composed of lactose in a gelatin capsule.  The pharmacy will dispense the blinded study drug to subjects 
free of charge. 
 
7.1.3 G-CSF(Neupogen, Granix, filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim): Patients will receive G-CSF 
10 ug/kg/day S.C. The dose of G-CSF is based on actual body weight. The dose of G-CSF may be rounded as follows:  Patients < 65 kg, receive 600 mcg, patients ≥65<80 kg, receive 780 mcg, patients ≥80<95 kg, receive 900 mcg, patients 
≥96<110 kg, receive 1080 mcg, patients ≥110kg receive 1200 mcg. The G-CSF is 
used to mobilize stem cells. G-CS F is commercially available.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Availability  
 
Commercially available in single use vials containing 480 mcg/vial (300 mcg/ml, 
1.6 mg/vial). Should be stored at 2-8oC (do not freeze and do not shake) and is stable for at 
least 1 year at this temperature.

[IP_ADDRESS] Administration 
 
Filgrastim or tbo-filgrastim will be given by [CONTACT_147612] 10 g/kg/d; 
patient or other caregiver will be instructed on proper injection technique 
 
7.1.4 Cyclophosphamide: Optional and only for multiple myeloma patients. Patients will 
receive cyclophosphamide 2000 mg/m2 intravenously once a day for stem cell 
mobilization on day -12.  
The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 2-[bis(2-chlor oethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-
oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate. The molecular formula is C7H15Cl2N2O2P•H2O. The molecular weight is 279.1. Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent. Following intravenous administration, the eliminat ion half-life of cyclophosphamide ranges 
from 4.1 to 16 hours. There is extensive hepatic metabolism, as 
cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that is c onverted by [CONTACT_409102] 
(cytochrome P450 mixed-function oxidase) to the active form. Specifically, the 
activation pathway of cyclophosphamide involves CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 isoenzymes. CYP3A4 also catalyzes the inactivation of cyclophosphamide to dechloroethylcyclophosphamide. Metabolites include 4-
hydroxycyclophosphamide, aldophosphamide, phosphoramide mustard (believed 
to be the active antineoplastic metabolite of cyclophosphamide), acrolein (believed to cause hemorrhagic cystitis), and a number of inactive metabolites. Excretion of cyclophosphamide is exclusiv ely by [CONTACT_10521]; however, due to the 
non-ionized nature of the intact drug, renal tubular reabsorption is avid, resulting in a large fraction of the dose being eliminated by [CONTACT_171339]. 
   
[IP_ADDRESS] Availability 
Cyclophosphamide is commercially available and supplied as a lyophilized 
powder which is compatible in 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in glass or polyolefin containers and is incompatible with aluminum. 
Reconstituted solutions of lyophiliz ed cyclophosphamide are chemically 
and physically stable for 24 hours at room temperatures or for 6 days in the 
refrigerator. Specific temperatures are not provided by [CONTACT_3455].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation Cyclophosphamide will be prepared per institutional standards.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration 
Cyclophosphamide will be given intr avenously once a day at 2000 mg/m

Characterize the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells mobilized by [CONTACT_659082].  
      Our scientific studies clearly demonstrate the importance of defining and characterizing the 
cellular content and function of grafts mobilized following the novel regimen of G-CSF + 
meloxicam.  1 10 mL EDTA tube of blood will be sampled from patients at the following timepoints: baseline prior to initiating meloxicam or placebo (day -6), and on day 0 (first apheresis day), and on subsequent days of apheresis if no additional mobilization rescue is given. The following assays will be performed on blood samples: 1)  CD34
+ cells will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_1603]-cytometry using the ISHAGE protocol [53] as performed routinely in our 
clinic; 2) Functionally defined hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM and BFU-
E).  Assays will be performed using methylcellulose media with 30% HI-FCS, 1 U/ml Epo, 50 
ng rhSCF and 10 ng rhGM-CSF, and CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-GEMM quantified after 7 days incubation at 37
oC, in 5% CO 2, 5% O [ADDRESS_889180] previously 
described (Figure 5 and _ENREF_40  [46]).  
 
            In addition to the above analysis, the sample collected on the first day of apheresis will also 
be assessed for content of 1) Total CD34+ cells and the most primitive subset CD34+CD38-
CD90+CD45RA-CD49f+ [64-68] 2)  CXCR4 expression on CD34+ cells ; ; and 3) immune cell 
subsets  by [CONTACT_1603]-cytometry. Immune cell s ubsets to be analyzed include B (CD19+) cells, NK 
(CD3-CD56+) cells, total T cell subsets (CD3+CD4+CD8-, CD3+CD4-CD8+), and Treg cells 
(CD45+CD25+FOXP3+). Also, for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, we will determine the proportion of 
naïve cells (CD45RA+CD27+), CD45RA-expressing effector memory cells (CD45RA+CD27-), 
central memory (CD45-CD27+CD62L+) cells, effector memory type I cells (CD45RA-
CD27+CD62L-), and effector memory type II cells (CD45RA-CD27-) cells. As dendritic cell 
(DC) content of the graft may also impact on outcome of allogeneic HCT, we will also evaluate the plasmacytoid (Lin
-DR+CD11c-CD123+) and myeloid (Lin-DR+CD11c+CD123-) DC 
mobilized.

19 10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is 
not considered to be related to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms.  
10.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more sever form. 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279340]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed 
before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or 
 Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
 elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen 
 emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resu lting in inpatient admission 
 respi[INVESTIGATOR_659068] 28, 2016

20 10.1.3  Expectedness 
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those t hat have been previously identified 
as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this 
study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the 
current adverse event list, the Inve stigator’s Brochure, the package 
insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential 
risk.   
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events 
associated with the study agent(s). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered 
unexpected  when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from 
information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
10.1.4  Attribution 
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 Definite – The AE is clearly related
 to the study treatment. 
 Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment. 
 Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
 Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment. 
 Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.

to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141752]. This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 11.1.2, as well as the following:  
 Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are 
unexpected and possibly, probably or definitely related/associated with the intervention. 
 
 All Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) Events – Unless expected AND 
specifically listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting. 
 
 All Grade 5 (fatal) Events – When the participant is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_889186] study intervention.  
 Note
: If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time of 
continuing review.   Grade 4 (life threatening) events are not required to be reported as SAEs if they are expected events related to stem cell transplantation. These include neutropenia, neutropenic fever within 14 days of transplantation, oral 
mucositis, thrombocytopenia, minor bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g. epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]), 
infections in the first 100 days of transplantation (e.g. pneumonia, line sepsis, cellulitis). 
 Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_91394], but not later than 10 
days of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator 
does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_889187] awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 A sample size of 15 patients per group provides 90% power to detect a 1.5 fold increase in the 
number of circulating CD34+ cells on the first day of apheresis with the addition of meloxicam compared to G-CSF + placebo. The fold change is defined as the difference between group means that is expressed as a multiple of the standard deviation assumed to be common in both groups. A two-sided Mann-Whitney test is used at a 1% level, under the assumption of a normal 
distribution for the number of circulating CD34+ cells. The Mann-Whitney test will also be used 
to compare the number of apheresis sessions required to collect ˜ 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg between the patient groups.  To show that meloxicam-treated patients will need 1  less apheresis session to achieve  ˜5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg, 50 patients in each group will be required to achieve 81% power at a one-sided 10% alpha level, assuming an average of two 
sessions will be required to collect ˜5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg in G-CSF-treated patients.   The 
time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment will estimated by [CONTACT_8761]-Meier method and the 
difference between groups compared by [CONTACT_659083]. Cell population numbers and HPC in peripheral and apheresis products will be summarized respectively by [CONTACT_498361], mean and standard deviation.  In peripheral blood
, the difference in cell types following meloxicam and G-
CSF mobilization relative to baseline will be compared to the change following G-CSF alone 
using the Mann-Whitney test or two-sample t-test.   The proportion of patients failing stem cell 
mobilization will be a secondary comparison between the two groups. Fisher's exact test will be used to explore the effect of adding meloxicam but will have limited power.   
 
14. PUBLICATION PLAN 
  
The outcomes of the study including the correlative science studies will be analyzed and hopefully be presented at the professional clinical and scientific meetings.  The results will then be submitted to peer reviewed journals for publication.

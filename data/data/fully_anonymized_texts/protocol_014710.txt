Study Endpoints The primary effectiveness endpoint is to demonstrate that the LFR-260 is within 0.5D (+/-) in measuring sphere and cylinder results and within [ADDRESS_702738] for the purpose of this evaluation.  The accuracy of the acuity measurement obtained by [CONTACT_539277]-260 will be evaluated for both cases (uncorrected, corrected) measured with the conventional phoropter. It will be assessed comparing the LFR-260 acuity measurement to the conventional acuity measurement using a Snellen chart (scored to the letter), with similar analyses used for the refractive components.  For each measurement, the paired difference will be computed.  Good clinical agreement is defined a priori as ≤±0.5 D for sphere and cylinder measurements and ≤±10 degrees for axis measurements for subjects with low astigmatism and ≤±[ADDRESS_702739] in terms of sphere and cylinder measurements.

LFR-260 Investigational Plan_v1.0_18-Feb-2022  17  4.2 Investigational group The LFR-260 is a portable digital refractor which allows for determination of refractive error as well as for fully remote refractions while social distancing. The device offers a solution that embodies all the aspects that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] a refraction evaluation in a mobile approach while giving the practitioner full control, ease of use and patient comfort.  
 Figure 1: Image of the LFR-[ADDRESS_702751] phoropter on the market is comprised of a set of lenses which can be adjusted by [CONTACT_539282] a patient through different settings as in "do you see better now?" format. In contrast, the objective device, LFR-260, achieves the same functionality but relies on a digital approach based on a micro lens array, a high-density embedded display, and a tunable lens. The device was developed taking a different approach that allows a significant reduction in the number of lenses, allowing higher portability and smaller footprint. The lower number of lenses does not compromise functionality compared to other traditional solutions. With these components, the LFR-[ADDRESS_702752] optotypes (Snellen, ETDRS, Landolt C, LEA symbols) such as: • Determining the required spherical correction

The results for both refractions will be recorded separating the components Sphere (S), Cylinder (C) and Axis (A). A calculation of the spherical equivalent will be performed at the end of the visit and both values will be recorded in the study documentation. The best corrected visual acuity for each measurement will be recorded.  4.[ADDRESS_702753] is seating comfortably the examiner will measure the distance between the outer canthus of the eye and the visual acuity to be used. The left eye will be patched while testing the right eye and vice versa. They could be covered with the occlude or using the masking capabilities of the LFR-260.  The following outcomes will be measured (for both eyes):  • Unaided VA • Aided VA • Distance for the test  Evaluation of the refractive state should be performed by [CONTACT_539283] (or equivalent depending on the patient) at 20 feet (or adjusted to the appropriate distance depending on the dimensions of the actual optometric office). The subject should be informed that the chart only includes letters (or equivalent for patient population).  Outcomes will be recorded. If a line was incomplete, the scored letters should be added to the VA. The goal is to obtain best corrected visual acuity (20/20 Snellen) to ensure that the highest level of visual acuity possible for the patient.  Visual acuity testing will be performed without the use of cycloplegic agents and or pupil dilation at all times. To control the potential effect of instrument myopia we will propose starting the examination using the fogging method to relax any potential accommodation.

LFR-[ADDRESS_702754] sequence In the traditional refractor procedure of Snellen charts (or equivalent), if the patient cannot see a letter, the practitioner moves the patient closer to the chart 1m at the time. In the case of LFR-260, the letter sizes will adjust to simulate such movement and change of perceived size and recorded accordingly. Such adjustment should take place until the subject can see the top letters. The smallest letter the subject can see clearly would be considered the VA for distance.  Actual test sequence: a) Screening phase: In which the examiner will initially determine by [CONTACT_539284] (or equivalent) level at which the subject will correctly identify letters. b) Testing phase: the examiner will start presenting letters of the size determined at the screening phase and smaller ones. c) Test continuation: if a letter is missed at a level, one level larger will be added to the testing. If a letter is correct at a level, one level smaller will be added to the mix. d) Acuity determination: Tests of [ADDRESS_702755] level with 5/[ADDRESS_702756] level with 0/[ADDRESS_702757] are determined. e) Quad view: at any time during a refraction, the ECP may provide a patient with a “quad view”.  This mode shows four different prescriptions simultaneously and allows the patient to switch from a memory-based decision to a solely vision-based decision.  4.[ADDRESS_702758] will be asked to read the Snellen chart (or equivalent) emphasizing that each letter will be scored and will ask the subject to take their time in answering in order to achieve best identification. The examiner will record each letter identified correctly on a score sheet. If a letter is not correctly recognized it will not be recorded, each correct letter is a point. The score of each line, even if zero, and the total score for the eye will be recorded right after the examination and recorded in the patient chart and the case report form.   4.[ADDRESS_702759] Screening and Recruitment A study coordinator (e.g. research nurse or staff member) designated specifically for this study, investigator, or sub-investigator at each investigative site will approach each potential subject and inquire about their interest and eligibility in participating in this study. If the patient wishes to participate, a member of the research team will go through the informed consent / assent (where applicable) process, which will explain the purpose of the study, the procedures, the risk/benefits, alternatives to participation, and their confidentiality.  After the consent process, the subject will be screened to confirm eligibility.

LFR-260 Investigational Plan_v1.0_18-Feb-2022  26  7.0 Statistical Analysis  7.1 Study Design and Randomization The LFR-260-101 study is a multi-center, open-label, 2x2 cross-over design with the aim of investigating the effectiveness of the LFR-260 phoropter device compared to the traditional phoropter.  7.2 Analysis Sets 7.2.1 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) All randomized patients will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set according to the group to which they were randomized.  7.2.2 Full Analysis Set (FAS) The Full Analysis Set (FAS) analysis set will be defined similarly to the ITT analysis set except that patients will be analyzed according to the order of devices actually administered. Primary safety analyses will be conducted in the FAS analysis set.  If all ITT patients receive their intended device order, the FAS and ITT analysis sets will coincide and will be referred to as the ITT analysis set.   7.2.3 Per Protocol Primary effectiveness analyses may be repeated in a Per Protocol (PP) analysis set.  The PP analysis set will exclude from the ITT analysis set patients that had clinically significant violations of inclusion or exclusion criteria or post randomization protocol violations that may reasonably be predicted to impact on effectiveness endpoints and those that have missing data.  7.3 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  The primary effectiveness endpoint is to demonstrate that the LFR-260 is within 0.5D (+/-) in measuring sphere and cylinder results and within 10 degrees for axis results among subjects with low astigmatism and within 5 degrees among subjects with moderate to high astigmatism from the traditional phoropter in a very large proportion of subjects.  7.4 Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis  The primary hypothesis for this study is that the probability of simultaneously achieving good clinical agreement for sphere, cylinder, and axis exceeds a performance goal for measurements made by [CONTACT_539277]-260 compared to those obtained using the control device, traditional phoropter.   Symbolically, the null and alternative effectiveness hypotheses are: :

If LB exceeds 0.80, the device will have met the a priori defined performance goal.   7.7 Other Planned Analyses  7.7.1 Bland-Altman Agreement Analysis Supporting analyses will evaluate the distribution of paired differences between LFR-260 and reference for the three dimensions (sphere, cylinder, and axis) using Bland-Altman agreement analysis. This will include determination of the standard deviation of paired differences, the 95% limits of agreement, and an evaluation of systematic bias.  The Bland-Altman plot of paired differences versus the mean of measurements will be provided.  The relationship between bias and the mean of measurements will characterized.  The same analysis will be applied to the vector difference between LFR-[ADDRESS_702775] in terms of sphere and cylinder measurements.  The	vector	differences	is	square	root	of	(X1-Y1)	+	(X2-Y2)	where	the	X1	and	X2	are	measurements	of	sphere	and	cylinder	using	the	investigational	devices	and	Y1	and	Y2	are	the	same	measurements	using	the	gold	standard.			7.7.[ADDRESS_702776] to the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption necessary for the validity of the MI analyses.   7.7.4 Reliability and Repeatability Analysis Reliability of LFR-260 will be conducted in a subset of subjects for which measurements will be obtained twice in an office context.   This analysis will be repeated in a remote context. Reliability will be evaluated using intraclass correlations for each of the continuous measurements, sphere, cylinder, and axis and for the vector measurement of sphere and cylinder.   For a subset of 33 subjects (66 eyes), the LFR-260 device will be measured again approximately 60 minutes after the initial assessment in order to measure the repeatability/accuracy of the device.    8.[ADDRESS_702777] of care procedures.   Trial-specific risks include the risks associated with investigational device (LFR-260) and the risks associated with trial-related investigations and data collection.  Clinical investigations performed in this trial include non-invasive diagnostic methods and interview questionnaires.  These non-invasive diagnostics represent a minimal risk to the subject.   All adverse events regardless of whether they were investigational device- related will be reported and recorded according to current regulations.  See Section [ADDRESS_702778] the study according to the protocol.

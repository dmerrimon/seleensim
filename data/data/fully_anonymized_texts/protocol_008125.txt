evaluable subjects will be enroll ed in this study, and will undergo SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359538] (18F) 
Injection PET MPI, prior to ICA.  
Patients can be consider ed for enrolment if: 
• They are being scheduled via written documentation at the time of enrolment  to undergo ICA , and 
• They have undergone a clinically  indicated SPECT study which meets all study -specified imaging 
and stress test ing (Section 9.3) criteria, or are will ing to undergo SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359539].  
Study Population:  
Five hundred and fifty -two (552)  evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this study. Assuming a 15% drop -
out rate, 650 subjects will need to be enrolled initially.  
While enrolment will not be formally stratified, enrolment will be monitored and the recruitment plan 
may be adjusted during the course of the study to ensure adequate representation of subjects aged ≥[ADDRESS_448626] BMI ≥30 kg/m2, and one-third will be women.

calculated for each of the 3 readers. 
Sensitivity and specificity are defin ed as follows:  
• True Positives (TP): Subjects with abnormal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359558]  
• True Negatives (TN): Subjects with normal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359559]  
• False Positives (FP): Subjects with abnormal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359559]

A dosed subject whose PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359560] (i.e., a miss ing rest and/or stress image) will be 
excluded from the MITT analysis population .  Also, a subject with a missing truth standard will be 
excluded from the MITT analysis population .  A summary of reasons for all miss ing data will be

subject is included in the MITT population, the readers will be ask ed to read SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359561] , regardless of image quality and interpretability .  
To indicate when a diagnosis is forced, t he reader will record in the blind ed-read case report form ( CRF) 
which images are consider ed uninterpretable .  The data on image quality and interpretability will be 
collected separately dur ing the blinded read and will be analysed separately by [CONTACT_359742] .   
The 2 primary efficacy endpoints are calculat ed as follows from different subsets of the population:

To control the false -positive rate at a 1-sided 0.[ADDRESS_448633] ed at a 
1-sided 0.025 level of significance; when a statistical test for a given endpoint fails to reach statistical 
significance in the appropriate direction, test ing on all remain ing secondary endpoints in the hierarchy 
will cease and the study will be consider ed successful on all secondary endpoints up to that point.   
In the secondary efficacy analysis, the criteria for success will be the statistical superiority of sensitivity in 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359569], and the noninferiority of specificity in

specificity analysis includes only the subjects without CAD, the analysis of sensitivity and specificity will 
be separate, as follows:   
Let s1 = sensitivity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI, and s 2 = sensitivity in SPECT MPI;  
Let p1 =specificity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI, and p 2 = specificity in SPECT MPI.  
Therefore, the test of hypotheses will be as follows:

4 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death in modern industrial ised countries.  
CAD is the s ingle largest cause of death in the Unit ed States (US) [Roger et al 2012].  
According to data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) 
from 2011 to 2014, the prevalence of CAD in all adults > 20 years of age was 6.3% (16.5 
million Americans) ; and in 2014, mortality from CAD accounted for 1 in every 7 deaths 
(364,593 directly relat ed to coronary heart disease [ CHD], and there were  530,989 deaths 
where CHD was mentioned) .  In 2017, an estimated [ADDRESS_448647] a new CHD 
event (defin ed as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359578] [ MI] or CHD death) and 325,[ADDRESS_448648] the US healthcare system $ 11.[ADDRESS_448649] 
$10.[ADDRESS_448650] ed to double between 2013 and 2030.  Therefore, prevention, early 
diagnosis, and treatment of CAD are essential to reduce mortality  [Benjamin et al 2017]. 
Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is the definitive procedure for diagnosis of obstructive 
CAD.  It is an invasive examination that involves catheter isation of the heart , allowing an 
anatomical evaluation that defines the presence, location, and severity of stenoses in the 
coronary arteries .  However, limitations exist to the sensitivity and specificity of ICA for 
defining myocardial perfusion.   ICA does not determine whether a stenosis ca uses ischemia . 
ICA is restrict ed to the assessment of large vessels, provid ing no visualisation of arterioles and 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037].  Fractional flow reserve (FFR) assessment , a measure of the decrease in perfusion 
pressure across a stenotic vessel  under hyperaemic  conditions, better defines the 
haemodynamic consequence of a stenosis.   However, FFR analysis does not account for the 
presence of scar, collateral flow, or microvascular  dysfunction of the area subtend ed by [CONTACT_359745]; these limitations may affect clinical interpretation of FFR analysis  [Hussain et al 
2016].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] g uideline recommendation s for its use to define the h aemodynamic 
significance of intermediate stenoses, FFR is perform ed in only 27% of the cases where it is 
indicated [Toth et al 2014].  Cardiac catheter isation, including FFR analysis,  is not without 
risk.  Estimates of the incidence of periprocedural stroke range fr om 0.18% to 0.44%, while the 
incidence of coronary artery perforation range s from 0.5% to 3%.  The overall risk of 
periangiographic death in patients undergo ing catheterisation without intervention is about 
0.08% [Tavakol et al 2012]. 
Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imag ing (MPI) is the most mature cardiovascular imag ing 
technique, with advanc ed quantitative tools and a vast evidence base in over 100,000 patients 
[Shaw and Iskandrian 2004].  Stress MPI [CONTACT_4490] s ingle photon emission comput ed tomography 
(SPECT MPI) and positron emission tomography (PET  MPI) are widely us ed to identify the 
haemodynamic significance of CAD .  However, t he greatest strength of MPI  [INVESTIGATOR_359579] [Shaw et al 2012].  The extent and severity of ischemia and scarr ing 
on SPECT  MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359580] [Shaw et 
al 2012].  MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359581]-effective for the management of CAD .  In patients with stable angina 
pectoris, a noninvasive SPECT -MPI–guided management strategy has been shown to be 
economically  superior to an anatomic approach guid ed by [CONTACT_88622], without significant differences 
in clinical outcomes [Shaw et al 1999].  Radionuclide imag ing of myocardial blood flow has 
been shown to be an indispensable tool for the evaluation and management of CAD [Murthy et GE-265-303 CPR REV A03
Version 1.0 Approved  22 Jul 2021

Page 22 of 142 
al 2011] [Naya et al 2014].  With these unique capabilities, the clinical benefits of an 
appropriately perform ed MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359582] .   
In nuclear cardiology, assessments of r egional myocardial blood flow are perform ed in patients 
under rest and stress conditions with a radiolabell ed MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359583] (using 
tracers labell ed with thallium -201 [201Tl] or technetium -99m [99mTc]) or PET  MPI (using 
tracers labell ed with rubidium-82 [82Rb] or nitrogen -13 [13N] ammonia) .  The continu ed 
success of nuclear cardiology demands ongo ing re-evaluation of imag ing practices to optimise 
patient care.  An important challenge is choos ing the proper imag ing procedure for the 
individual patient.  Tailor ing imaging to the patient is critical for provid ing accurate and 
clinically mean ingful information to the physician.   
There are several integral components to a successful patient -centred imaging approach.  
Patient safety is of paramount importance when one is contemplat ing any diagnostic and/or 
therapeutic medical option .  For MPI, this approach includes not only the risk of the stress 
protocol but also the “risk” of perform ing unnecessary additional procedu res or administer ing 
inappropriate therapy because of a suboptimally perform ed test.  High-quality imag ing limits 
the latter through improv ed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, enhanc ed risk stratification, 
and less intra - and inter-observer variabili ty when interpret ing clinically significant changes in 
serial images .   
Another safety consideration is the risk from radiation exposure , which should be weigh ed in 
each individual case prior to initiat ing a study.  Consequently, a major factor influenc ing the 
choice of MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359584].  This issue is particularly 
relevant to younger patients and women of childbear ing potential.  However, even in older 
individuals and in those in whom the risk/benefit ratio is low, radia tion exposure should be 
limited to that dose requir ed to obtain a diagnostic study.  
Like SPECT  MPI, PET  MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359585] .  PET has several technical advantages over SPECT that account for improv ed 
image quality and therefore improv ed efficacy, includ ing: 
• Higher photon penetration combin ed with routinely measur ed (depth-dependent) 
attenuation correction because the high energy of the annihilation photons and the 
“coincidence detection ” technique of P ET imaging systems result in significant advantages 
in image quality . 
• High spatial and contrast resolution that allows for improv ed detection of small perfusion 
defects. 
• High tempora l resolution that allows fast dynamic imag ing of tracer kinetics . 
• High efficienc y resulting in lower administered radioactivity and therefore lower radiation 
dose to patients .   
A clear advantage of PET imag ing is its use of attenuation correction in all PET systems .  
Initial dedicat ed PET imaging systems us ed rotating line-sources (caesium-137, germanium -GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

68/gallium-68) to generate a transmission attenuation map, whereas currently manufactur ed 
PET systems use x -ray computed tomography ( CT) technology for attenuation correction , 
resulting in an improv ed image quality and  quantification opportunity .  Unlike SPECT, cardiac 
PET allows acquisition of gat ed “stress” data during peak hyperaemic  blood flow , with 
calculation of a peak stress left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) .  This may improve 
identification of high -risk patients or those with multi vessel CAD [Dorbala et al 2009].  
Furthermore, software solutions allow for absolute quantification of regional myocardial blood 
flow from dynamically acquir ed 82Rb and 13N ammonia cardiac PET studies ([Klein et al 2010] 
[El Fakhri et  al 2009]), and this may be particularly important and useful in evaluat ing 
multivessel and small vessel coronary disease, responses to medical therapy, and transplant 
vasculopathy .  When combin ed with the low dose from PET tracers, PET  MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359586] a 
significantly lower radiat ion dose than does SPECT MPI. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_359587] -generation SPECT -MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359588] -MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359589], there is a well -recognised need for the development of 
a new perfusion imag ing agent with more nearly ideal properties.  Both rubidium -82 (82Rb) and 
nitrogen-13 ammonia (13N ammonia) are approv ed by [CONTACT_3133] 
(FDA) for use in PET  MPI.  82Rb offers the advantage of be ing generator -produced on site, 
with a strong dependency upon strontium supply, as oppos ed to 13N ammonia, whose potential 
use is limit ed by [CONTACT_359746] -site cyclotron.   
The ''ideal'' MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359590] a very high first -pass extraction fraction and would track 
regional myocardi al blood flow over a wider range, permitt ing accurate estimation of absolute 
blood flow , particularly under conditions of either physical or pharmacologic stress .  The agent 
should exhibit excellent target -to-nontarget uptake ratios, with high uptake in th e myocardium 
and low uptake or rapid clearance from adjacent organs [Glover and Gropler 2007].   
Most PET -MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359591] .  Exercise PET -MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359592] -lives of the radiotracers .  In addition, a 
PET-MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359593] , as compar ed to agents limit ed to pharmacologic stress .  Thus, the 
opportunity exists for a new PET imag ing agent using Fluorine-18 (18F) that exhibits high 
extraction fraction .  Such an agent would take advantage of the high resolution, quantitative 
power, resistance to attenuation artefacts, and logistical simplicity of unit dos ing of 18F PET, 
and would be expect ed to exhibit improv ed sensitivity overall and specifically in detect ing 
multivessel CAD .  It also has the potential to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and reduce 
radiation dose when compared with studies us ing SPECT agents .   
The objective of us ing PET tracers such as Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) is to take advantage of the high 
extraction of this radiotracer, lead ing to a substantial difference in tracer uptake in normal vs 
underperfus ed regions.  Therefore, the uptake ratio of this tracer between an underperfused  
region and a normal region is expected to be higher than is observ ed with other tracers, which 
have either a low extraction rate or a roll -off phenomenon.  This increas ed ratio could possibly 
lead to an improv ed diagnostic efficacy.  Whereas the current SPECT guidelines tend to 
propose performing stress MPI [CONTACT_22705], for identify ing patients with very low likelihood of CAD 
presenting with normal stress perfusion images, a rest -stress acquisition sequence is GE-265-[ADDRESS_448651] ed with Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection include safety, dosimetry, and 
radiokinetics studies in healthy subjects, as well as [ADDRESS_448652] receiv ed Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection .  The results of these studies are detail ed in 
the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .  Overall, Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection 
was well-tolerated, and no clinically significant safety concerns were noted.  
Two consecutive Phase 1 studies administer ing Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection to healthy subjects 
were conduct ed to assess safety, dosimetry, and radiokin etics.  Safety assessments in both 
studies includ ed adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), laboratory values, and physical and neurological 
examinations.

The organ that showed the largest uptake was the liver (with 19.1% of the inject ed activity), 
followed by [CONTACT_359747] (with approximately 9.4% and 8.3%, respectively, of the 
injected activity).  Therefore, the maximum inject ed Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection dose that may 
be administer ed at rest without exceed ing 5 rem to the critical organ is 21 mCi (760 MBq), and 
the mean ED for Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection i s 0.071 rem/mCi ( 0.019 mSv/MBq).  The

to be 14 mCi (520 MBq).

subjects (Cohort l) underwent 2-day rest and exercise treadmill stress PET imag ing using a 
Bruce protocol, and 6 subjects (Cohort 2) underwent 2-day rest and pharmacologic stress PET 
imaging using adenosine as the stress agent .  Doses of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection were 
administer ed at rest on the first day (Day l ) and during stress on the se cond day (Day 2).   
From the exposure data , the critical organ for Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection follow ing exercise 
stress was determin ed to be the heart wall , with a mean estimat ed dose of 0.15 rem/mCi 
(0.039 mSv/MBq) .  The critical organ for Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection following pharmacologic 
stress was also determ ined to be the heart wall, with a mean estimat ed dose of 0.33 rem/mCi 
(0.090 mSv/MBq) .  Consequently, the maxim um injected dose of the compound that may be 
administer ed following exercise stress without exce eding 5 rem to the critical organ was 
determined to be 35 mCi (1276 MBq).  The maximum inject ed dose of the compound  that may 
be administered following pharmacologic stress without exceed ing 5 rem to the critical organ 
was determin ed to be 15 mCi (554 MBq). GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

6 STUDY DESIGN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, international , multicentre  study of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) 
Injection for PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359537].   
This study will be conduct ed at approximately 60 centres in Europe  and North America 
([LOCATION_002] and Canada).  
The procedure order will not be random ised but will be dependent upon the presentation of the 
patient at the site; however, in all cases SPECT and Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359609] [ADDRESS_448663] ing (Section 9.3) criteria ( hereby [CONTACT_59109]  “Off-study” SPECT exams ) (see Study 
Diagram, Figure 1).  
All subjects will be follow ed up for AEs within 2 days follow ing Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection 
administration, and for AEs and SAEs at approximately 2 weeks (14 to 17 days) follow ing the 
last Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection dose administration  and at the time of their ICA .   
Therefore, study subjects will participate in the study for up to [ADDRESS_448664] 
meets all the inclusion criteria but none of the exclusion criteria.   
Patients can be consider ed for enrolment  if: 
• They are being scheduled via written documentation at the time of enrolment  to undergo 
ICA, and 
• They have undergone a clinically  indicated SPECT study which meets all study -specified 
imaging and stress test ing (Section 9.3) criteria, or are will ing to undergo SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359610].   
ICA represents the regulatory accept ed truth standard for the determination of presence or 
absence of significant coronary stenosis .   
Study Population:  
Five hundred and fifty-two (552) evaluable subjects will be enroll ed in this study.  Assuming a 
15% dropout  rate, [ADDRESS_448665] ed during the course of the study to ensure  adequate 
representation of subjects aged ≥[ADDRESS_448666] BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, and 
one third will be women.   
An overview of study procedures is present ed in Figure 1.   
Figure [ADDRESS_448667] important causes of morbidity and mortality among women [Mosca 
2007].  Although overall cardiac mortality has declin ed on average 3% per year, with rates in 
men having decreased substantially, little change has been report ed in women [Mieres 2005].  
Even though  women reportedly have a lower frequency of clinically significant CAD (> 70% 
stenosis in 1 or more coronary arter ies; adjusted odds ratio  for women vs men , 0.34; P<.0001) 
and a lower rate of sudden cardiac death from coronary events ( 37% for women vs 56% for 
men), the prevalence of angina and mortality associat ed with ischaemic  heart disease is higher 
in women than in men.  Mortality 1 year after MI remains greater than 1 in 5 for women  
[Benjamin et al 2017].  Emerging evidence suggests that coronary microvascular disease, with 
or without obstructive CAD, contributes to the pathophysiology of ischaemic  disease in women 
[Tailor et al 2017]. In women, attenuation of the SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359611] a fixed or reversible perfusion defect , thus lead ing to 
decreased specificity of SPECT  MPI.  Given inherent attenuation correction with PET MPI, 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) PET imag ing may offer  improved diagnostic accuracy  when compared to 
SPECT MPI .   
PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359612]-related signal attenuation. The 
prevalence of obesity has been increasing markedly over the past several decades , with more 
than 78 million adults in the Unit ed States (~35% of the adult population) be ing assessed as 
obese in 2009-2010. Once consider ed a problem only in high -income nations, the obesity 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_359613] , with a dramatic rise in low - and middle -income countries, particularly 
in urban sett ings, even replac ing more traditional problems such as undernutrition .  Obesity is 
associated with numerous comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, heart failure with preserv ed ejection fraction, non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis, certain cancers, and sleep apnoea/sleep-disordered breathing.   
Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cardiac mortality [Jensen 
et al 2014].  As obesity is a major risk factor for car diovascular disease, assess ing ischemia in 
obese patients is clinically important .  The cardiovascular clinical evaluation of obese patients 
is limited by [CONTACT_71411]: rest ECG is influenced by [CONTACT_359750].  Imaging modalities may therefore be of interest in 
the evaluation of ischemia  for obese patients .  SPECT is frequently suboptimal , with 
artefactual myocardial perfusion defects resulting from the mark ed photon attenuation by [CONTACT_359751] [DePuey 1994] [DePuey and Garcia 1989], even with more recent equipment such as 
cadmium-zinc-telluride cameras [Fiechter et al 2012]. 
Since the Fram ingham study report, an increas ed burden of CVD has been observed in patients 
with type 2 diabetes.  The increase in the risk of CVD and mortality from diabetes represents 
an important decrease in life expectancy and in CVD-free life expectancy, given that diabetes 
is still associat ed with approximately an overall 2- to 3-fold increas ed risk of CVD mortality .  
On top of that, the prevalence of obesity has been report ed to be dramatically higher among 
individuals with diabetes than among those without diabetes [Fox et al 2004].  When diabetic GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

patients are compar ed with patients with other medical conditions, the diabetic patients’ first 
ischaemic  events are more frequently silent and more likely to involve the small vessels, as 
opposed to large vessels .  These find ings highlight the ne ed for high sensitivity, to accurately 
detect ischaemic  lesions at an early stage , to improve secondary prevention.  
This study’s safety monitor ing plan is justifiable and adequate from a safety standpoint in view 
of the follow ing: 
• The design of the safety plan permits a comparison of the safety variables in each subject at 
Baseline and after administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP).  
• The design of the safety plan allows a comparison of this study’s safety data set with those 
from other relat ed studies. 
• Consideration of a 2-week safety monitor ing follow-up permits the evaluation of late -
appearing adverse effects that may emerge or prog ress after the administration of IMP.  
• The measures us ed to assess safety are well  defined and reliable, and the propos ed safety 
analyses are adequate to assess the effects of the administration of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) 
Injection.

and BMS -747158-301.  
In 3 Phase I clinical studies of healthy volunteers, there were no adverse events relat ed to 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection.  In the most recent study (BMS-747158-201), 2 separate groups of 
patients (Cohort 1 [n=33] and Cohort 2 [n=143]) with known or suspect ed CAD were studi ed 
while hav ing a stress test. Five patients (2 in Cohort 1 and 3 in Cohort 2) reported a total of 10 
AEs; none of these adverse events were report ed by [CONTACT_359752] , and all were judg ed 
by [CONTACT_359753][INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection dose 
administration.  The AEs in Cohort 1 included pain in extremity ( 1; 3%) and headache ( 1; 3%). 
The AEs in Cohort [ADDRESS_448669] pressure ( 1; 0.6%), bradycardia ( 1; 0.6%), diarrhoea  (1; 
0.6%), nausea ( 1; 0.6%), electrocardiogram ST -segment depression ( 1; 0.6%), metallic taste in 
mouth (1, 0.6%); cough ( 1; 0.6%), and high blood pressure ( 1; 0.6%).  None of these events 
were consider ed serious, and all resolv ed in a short period of time without any complications.  
In the most recent study, BMS 747158-301, a total of 795 subjects receiv ed ≥1 dose of 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection .  Of these, 31 subjects ( 3.9%) did not complete the study.   The GE-265-303 CPR REV A03
Version 1.0 Approved  22 Jul 2021

GE Confidential  
Page 33 of 142 
majority of cases of discontinuation were due to inability to perform all study -mandated 
procedures (SPECT or coronary angiography).   Only 4 (0.5%) discont inuations were due to 
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAE s). In BMS747158 -301, TEAEs were report ed in 555 (69.8%) 
subjects; the majority of TEAEs were associated with either exercise or pharmacological stress 
testing or the underly ing disease.  Forty-four (5.5%) patients experienc ed TEAEs deem ed to be 
related to Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection .  Of these, 41 (5.2%) were subcategor ised as “possibly 
related” and 3 (0.4%) as “related .”  The most common (≥ 0.5%) related TEAEs report ed were 
headache ( 0.9%), angina pectoris (0.6%), dysgeusia ( 0.6%), diarrhoea  (0.5%), dyspnoea  
(0.5%), flushing (0.5%), and nausea ( 0.5%). 
Therefore, we do not expect a significant risk for the subjects enroll ed in the present Phase [ADDRESS_448670] ed diagnostic 
potential of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection should offset this limited risk by [CONTACT_359754][INVESTIGATOR_359614].  Therefore, we consider the 
benefit-risk ratio as positive for conduct ing this trial.   GE-265-[ADDRESS_448671] to undergo an ICA for the assessment of CAD 
because of medical history and/or symptoms call ing for this assessment.   
The population will include patients with intermediate and high pre-test probability of CAD , 
reflecting the spectrum of patients who would be expect ed to undergo nuclear imag ing tests.  
However, enrolment will no t be based on pre-test likelihood of CAD .  The performance of 
other functional stress tests (such as stress echocardiography, exercise stress 
electrocardiography, nuclear stress tests includ ing 82Rb or 13N-ammonia MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359615]) or coronary CT angiography prior to enrolment is permitted.  Recent 
intracoronary angiography (within the last 6 months) prior to enrolment is not permitted.

Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection , the IMP in this study,  is a novel PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359616] -18.  Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) is deliver ed as a sterile solution to be administer ed 
as an IV injection.  This agent is a structural analogue of py ridaben, a known mitochondrial 
complex 1 (MC-1) inhibitor.  However, Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359617]. Mitochondria constitute 20% to 30% of the myocardial intracellular volume.  
Consequently, molecules that target mitochondrial proteins may be enrich ed and retain ed 
selectively in the myocardium.  The isotopic half -life of 18F is 110 minutes.   
All subjects will receive 2 IV boluses of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection in a large peripheral vein: [ADDRESS_448674] and 1 during stress.  The dosages of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection administer ed at rest and 
during stress conditions will not exce ed a total of 14 mCi (520 MBq) for an individual subject.  
• Appearance : Clear, colourless,  and free of visible particulate matter  
• Strength/con centration : [18F]Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] ≥ 70 mCi in a nominal volume of 10 mL 
• Storage and handl ing conditions : Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359618] 15°C to 25°C up to 
a maximum of  [ADDRESS_448675] expi[INVESTIGATOR_359619].

Pharmacological stress agents utilis ed for the purposes of this clinical study will be 
administer ed as per American Society of Nuclear Cardiology or European Association of 
Cardiovascular Imag ing standards and drug labell ing as per package insert; the a dministration 
will be through an IV line.  During pharmacologic stress, the radiopharmaceutical will be 
administer ed during the peak vasodilatory effect accord ing to the respective Package Insert (if 
applicable) of each stressor.  If a pharmacologic stress  is perform ed using adenosine, the 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection and the adenosine must be administer ed via separate lines or via 
separate ports on the same IV line.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_448676] A ccountability  
Each investigator is responsible for ensur ing that deliveries of IMP , other medicinal products 
(specified above),  and other study materials from the Sponsor are correctly received, recorded, 
handled, and stor ed safely and properly in accordance with all applicable regulatory guidelines, 
and used in accordance with this protocol. 
All IMP containers (opened, unopened, or empty) must be destroyed on site after its scheduled 
use in accordance with site policies.  See IMP handling procedures for further details on 
receipt, recording, handling, and accountabilit y procedures  related to IMP .  A list of IMP , other 
medicinal product s, and other materials that were destroyed, must be prepar ed and signed by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  If there are any discrepancies, an explanation for these 
should also be provided.  
The site will be provided with the IB for the IMP . 
8.1.[ADDRESS_448677](s) Complaints  
In the event of an IMP complaint (e.g., breakage, leakage, particulate matter, discoloration), the 
investigator or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_359622] (e.g., ‘Delivery Note for Product ,’ Drug Shipp ing and Receiv ing Form, or 
equivalent form).  This should be promptly forward ed to the person indicat ed on the shipp ing 
documentation.  Once the complaint is received, the Clinical Supplies Manager will register the 
complaint and determine , per Sponsor proced ures, if the complaint is minor or significant.  All 
complaints will be followed  up and the appropriate action will be implement ed, per Sponsor 
procedures.  
8.[ADDRESS_448678] be re -screened for the study after having 
failed to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.   If the inve stigator has any question about any GE-265-[ADDRESS_448679]’s eligibility to participate in the study, the investigator or study personnel should 
contact [CONTACT_359757]’s eligibility.  
Each subject’s identification number will consist of a 3-digit site code plus a 4-digit 
consecutive number.   For example, site “ 999” will assign the number “ 999-0001” to its first 
subject, “ 999-0002” to its second subject, and so on. To preserve the integrity of the study, it is 
crucial that these numbers be assign ed in consecutive numerical order.  
All subjects will receive the same treatment. Therefore, there will be no assignment to 
treatment groups.  
8.3 Selection of Doses and Tim ing 
Duration of Study  
All screen ing assessments will occur within 60 days prior to ICA.  Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection

refrain from consum ing any caffeinat ed substances, dipyridamole -containing medicatio n, or 
methylxanthine -containing medication within [ADDRESS_448703], to allow 
for the use of a pharmacologic stressor in the event that the patient does not reach the protocol -
required minimum 85% of APMHR or does not develop ischaemic  symptoms .   
No food will be allow ed within 3 hours prior to either the pharmacologic stress or exercise 
stress. 
For subjects on beta-blocker therapy, a determination should be made, in concert with their 
treating physician, if there are any condi tions in which discontinuation of beta -blocker therapy 
could be contraindicated (e.g., tachyarrhythmias, uncontrolled or poorly controlled 
hypertension).  If medically safe, beta -blocker therapy should be withheld for 24 hours prior to GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

the PET MPI.  A focused clinical screen for new or worsening symptoms indicative of unstable 
coronary artery disease will be conducted prior to performing any procedures at the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] 
(18F) PET visit.  If the clinical status screening is positive , the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) PET visit can 
either be rescheduled (up to 1 time) after symptoms stabilize or the subject can be discontinued 
from the study.   
During the Rest and Stress Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) PET-MPI [CONTACT_4838], the follow ing will be performed:  
• Blood samples for laboratory test ing will be collect ed prior to the PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] [ADDRESS_448704] occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_359653] (e.g. within 48 hours) , an additional blood 
sample may be anal ysed by [CONTACT_359763] (i.e., serum creatinine, AST, ALT and total bilirubin).  For all subjects, 
blood must be sent for central analysis of all protocol -specified laboratory parameters, 
whether or not blood is sent to a local lab for limited biochemical analysis for screening 
purposes (as noted above).   
• Urine samples for laboratory test ing will be collect ed prior to the PET  MPI. 
• Pregnancy test, for women of child -bearing potential (see the Stud y Schedule of Events 
[Table 1]). 
• Concurrent medications will be recorded.   
• Vital signs will be recorded.   For rest PET -MPI, vital signs will be collected u p to 
20 minutes prior to dose  and 30 (±5) minutes post-dose.  For stress PET -MPI, vital signs 
will be collected u p to 20 minutes prior to dose (if >[ADDRESS_448705] and stress 
injections)  and 30 (±5) minutes post-dose.   
• Pulse oximetry will be recorded.  
• Eight 12-lead ECG record ings will be performed  (See Section 10.2.3). 
• A physical examination will be performed.  
• If neurologic abnormalities are found dur ing the physical examination, a full neurologic 
examination will be performed.   
• During the rest test, all subjects will receive an IV bolus injection of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) 
Injection in a large peripheral vein .  The dose (volume and radioactivity) will be record ed 
in the CRF.  
• A stress test (exercise or pharmacologic) will be perform ed after the rest test, and on the 
same day.   
• The type of stress (exercise or pharmacologic) will be the same type us ed for that 
subject for the SPECT MPI [CONTACT_348244] .   GE-265-303 CPR REV A03
Version 1.0 Approved  22 Jul 2021
GE Confidential  
Page 52 of 142 
• For subjects who received a pharmacologic stressor dur ing the stress SPECT MPI, 
the same agent and dose will be us ed during the stress Flur pi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) PET-MPI 
[CONTACT_348244].  During pharmacologic stress, radiopharmaceutical injection will be 
administer ed during the peak vasodilatory effect, accord ing to the respective 
prescribing information or SmPC (as applicable) of each stressor.  Acceptable 
pharmacologic stress agents are list ed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
• If adenosine is us ed as a pharmacologic stressor, the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) 
Injection and the adenosine must be administer ed through separate lines or 
through separate ports of the same IV line.   Note: Central lines should NOT be 
used for the administration of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection.  The Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] 
(18F) Injection will be administer ed after the administration of the 
pharmacologic stressor.  The administration of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection  will 
be timed to coincide with maximal coronary vasodilation, which depends on 
the vasodilatory agent used.  
• For a subject who underwent exercise stress for SPECT MPI, the investigator is 
required to use the same exercise stress protocol for the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359654] z (18F) Injection 
PET that was used for the SPECT MPI, unless otherwise clinically indicated.  
• During exercise stress, the radiopharmaceutical for both SPECT and PET should be 
administered at peak stress, defin ed as ≥85% of the APMHR or follow ing the 
occurrence of typi[INVESTIGATOR_359655].  Patients should continue to 
exercise for an additional 1 to 2 minutes, as clinically advisable, after the 
radiopharmaceutical  injection.   If a patient cannot reach the study -required 
minimum of 85% of the APMHR or does not develop ischaemic  symptoms, the 
radiopharmaceutical should not be administered.  
• The standard clinical practice should be us ed for determin ing early termination of 
exercise or pharmacologic stress test ing in the presence of any absolu te or relative 
indications, includ ing the presence of isch aemic symptoms ( i.e., angina, or angina 
equivalent) for early termination.   The exercise stress test should be perform ed only by 
[CONTACT_359762].   Detailed 
recommendations for exercise test ing performance must be follow ed as describ ed in 
detail in the 2009 Recommendations for clinical exercise laboratories: a scientific 
statement from the AHA [Myers et al 2009]  
• At 1 hour after administration of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection for the stress exam, a physical 
examination will be performed.  
• If any neurologic abnormalities are not ed during the physical examination, a full neurologic 
examination will be performed.  
• Injection-site monitor ing (immediately prior to the first injection, immediately after the first 
injection of IMP for the rest exam, then immediately after the second injection of IMP for 
the stress exam, and ultimately at [ADDRESS_448706] injection of IMP).  GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

10.2 Safety Assessments  
Subjects will be closely monitored for safety until completion of all study procedures. .  Safety 
monitoring will include adverse events (AEs), medication errors, TEAEs, and SAE 
assessments, vital signs, ECGs, haematology , clinical chemistry laboratory tests,  and 
urinalysis .  All subjects will be follow ed up by [CONTACT_359764] 2 days 
(+24 hours) follow ing Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection administration, and for AEs and SAEs at 
approximately 2 weeks (14 to 17 days) follow ing the last Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection dose 
administration .  For subjects undergoing SPECT for the purposes of this clinical study, their 
safety will be monitor ed as per institutional standards .   
The investigator(s) and the Sponsor/CRO will review the safety data.  The follow ing safety 
data will be collect ed and evaluated:  
• Clinical laboratory parameters: serum biochem istry, haematology , and urinalysis ( Table 
3) 
• Vital signs: systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and intermittent 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_339749]  
• Continuous ECG monitor ing 
• Lead II rhythm strip and 12-lead ECG 
• Physical examination  
• Injection site monitor ing 
• Post-treatment events (AEs and SAEs)  
Prespecifi ed normal limits for vital signs and ECG intervals are provid ed in Section 15.3.

The signed and interpret ed laboratory results will be kept together with the subject’s CRF 
(paper or electronic) as supplemental pages, both centrally and at the site.  
Blood samples will be obtain ed for assessment of serum biochemistry  and haematology  at the 
various pre- and post-treatment time point ranges describ ed in Table 1.  It is anticipat ed that the 
maximum amount of blood taken will not be more than [ADDRESS_448711]’s study participation .  Samples will be analysed at a central laboratory (for 
parameters, see Table 3).  All blood samples will be process ed and handl ed per standard 
laboratory procedures .  All retain ed samples will be destroy ed after completion of the study.   
For the purposes of screening, an additional blood sample may be analy sed by [CONTACT_359765] (i.e., serum creatinine, AST, 
ALT and total bilirubin).  
Urine will be collect ed at the various  pre-treatment time point ranges describ ed in Table 1.  
The time of void will be document ed on the CRF .  Urine void ed will be analysed for 
parameters  listed in Table 3. Any abnormal laboratory find ings that constitute an AE (e.g., any 
abnormal find ings leading to an intervention other than repeat ing the laboratory test) should be 
reported as such and should be follow ed up until the outcome is known .  Also, additional 
diagnostic tests may be indicat ed to determine a more precise diagnosis of the subject’s 
condition (e.g., order ing a WBC differential t o help character ise a high or low WBC count, or 
ordering a determination of r ed cell indices to help characterise a low haematocrit ).   
10.2.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7137] e, temperature ) will be 
monitored at Baseline (prior to IMP administration) and dur ing the in- and out-patient follow -
up periods , according to the Study Schedule of E vents (Table 1).  Before vital signs are 
measured, the subject should rest for ≥5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (if possible) .  The same GE-265-[ADDRESS_448712] 12-lead ECG will be obtain ed at Screening and during Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532]  (18F) MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359664].  The Screening ECG can be obtained on any local ECG machine and will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_1720] a designee at the investigative site. A clinically  indicated 
ECG performed within [ADDRESS_448713] pain 
or instability, can be used as the Screening ECG. The results of this ECG will be captured in 
the eCRF but not submitted to the ECG Core Laboratory for a nalysis.  
Before the administration of the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection for the rest examination, three  12-
lead ECGs , separated by [CONTACT_2669] 5 minutes,  will be obtained with equipment provided by [CONTACT_359766]. ECG clocks should be synchronised wit h imaging equipment .  Note: 
pre-dose ECGs should be obtained within [ADDRESS_448714] measurement.  Three additional ECGs (each 
separated by 30 -60 seconds) will be obtained  starting at 2 minutes (± 30 -60 seconds)  after the 
administration  of the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) injection for the rest examination . Single ECGs will also 
be obtained at [ADDRESS_448715] injection.  These 8 ECGs will be submitted to the ECG 
Core Laboratory  for analysis.  The investigator will be asked to provide a determination of 
clinical significance on the eCRF only for the 3 ECGs obtained at 2, 10, and 30 minutes after 
injection of  Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F).  If the investigator determines that there are any cl inically 
significant changes from the 3 ECGs obtained before Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) injection, those changes 
will be reported as AEs.  
No additional ECGs are required for this study.   However, sites should perform stress testing 
with ECG monitoring as required by [CONTACT_779]’s institutional standards for stress testing. ECGs 
acquired in association with the stress test will not be collected by [CONTACT_359767] a re ported TEAE.   Reports generated during stress testing , including 
ECG analysis and interpretation , will be collected by [CONTACT_1034].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigational Site Responsibilities  
Each 12-lead ECG will be evaluat ed at US sites by a board-certified cardiologist or ad vanced 
cardiac life support (ACLS) -certified licensed physician .  Each 12-lead ECG will be eval uated 
at European sites by a cardiologist .  An ACLS -certified licensed physician read ing ECGs may 
make clinical management decisions as needed .  However, the hardcopy ECG strips will be 
read on the same day or day after the ECG examination by a board -certified cardiologist at the 
site who signs off on the ECG interpretation.  
Subject management decisions may be bas ed on the 12-lead ECG find ings.   
Pre-specified normal limits a nd expand ed normal limits  for 12-lead ECG intervals are provid ed 
in Section  15.3.  Each 12-lead ECG trac ing must be sign ed and dated, and the assessment 
results collect ed in the CRF .  During continuous ECG monitor ing, the investigator or GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

appropriate delegate (concordant with local practice) will observe the real -time ECG find ings 
and take note of any changes in intervals and/or waveforms .  The continuous ECG monitor ing 
need not be 12-lead. 
Each 12-lead ECG at each time point (all intervals, heart rate and interpretation, and identifi ed 
with the subject’s initials, subject’s study number, and date and time of record ing), will be 
retained in the investigator’s study record for each subject.  The investigator will not be 
expected to calculate QTc intervals.   
[IP_ADDRESS] ECG Core Laboratory R esponsibilities  
The ECG data from all time points will be electronically transferr ed and independently read at 
an ECG core laboratory by a board -certified cardiologist  or an internist who will measure the 
QTc interval .  The core ECG laboratory cardiologist will review, interpret, and provide a 
written assessment of the ECGs, determin ing all intervals (e.g., PR, QRS, QT, and RR) and 
wave changes and calculat ing QTc intervals .  The reports will be sign ed and dated .  These data 
will be transmitt ed electronically directly to the Sponsor/CRO. 
10.2.4 Physical Examination  
A qualified physician or a no n-physician medically  certified individual who is certified either 
by [CONTACT_180347]/National law t o perform physical examinations  will conduct physical examinations at 
the baseline time point,  before the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection rest MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359665] 1 hour after 
the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection stress MPI [CONTACT_15233] .  Ideally, the same individual should conduct 
the physical examination at all requir ed time points .  The physical examination will include 
recording an assessment for the presence of abnormalities of the foll owing: general 
appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, cardiovascular system, back and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
abdomen, extremities, injection site, lymph nodes, and neurological exam.  
A full neurological exam will be perform ed if neurologic abnormalities are observ ed during the 
physical neurological examination.  It will include record ing an assessment for the presence of 
abnormalities of the follow ing: level of consciousness, motor function, sensory function, 
proprioception/position sense of extremities, reflexes (biceps, triceps, patellar, ankle), mood 
and affect, cognitive function, cerebellar, speech, orientation, memory, and gait.  
In the event that new abnormal physical find ings and worsening abnormal physical find ings are 
encounter ed during the study,  these terms are defin ed as follows: a new abnormal physical 
finding is defined as one that occurs when a subject’s normal baseline physical examination 
becomes abnormal post -baseline.  A worsen ing abnormal physical find ing is defined as one 
that occurs when a subject's abnormal baseline physical examination becomes worse post -
baseline.  These new find ings will be record ed as AEs. 
10.2.5 Injection Site Monitoring 
The injection site will be evaluat ed at the follow ing time points:  immediately prior to firs t 
injection of IMP, immediately after the first injection  of IMP (for the rest exam ) then GE-265-303 CPR REV A03
Version 1.0 Approved  22 Jul 2021
GE Confidential  
Page 61 of 142 
immediately after the second injection of IMP (for stress exam ) and ultimately at [ADDRESS_448716] injection .   
Abnormal injection site find ings include, but are  not limited to, radiopharmaceutical 
extravasation, bleed ing, haematoma, redness, and infection .  They will be recorded as AEs in 
the CRF. 
10.2.6 Adverse Events 
All AEs/SAEs that occur after informed consent shall be recorded in the AE/SAE report form 
(see the St udy Schedule of Events, Table 1).   
Study personnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs  after administration of IMP 
(see Section 8.1), particularly those that may be life threaten ing.  Personnel who are trained in 
the acute management of anaphylaxis and other emergencies and who have access to 
appropriate clinical supplies must be immediately available for 1 hour after dosing.  Treatment 
of SAEs should be primarily supportive of vital functions.  
AE and TEAE Definition:  An AE is defin ed as any untoward medical occurrence or an 
already present event that worsens either in intensity or frequency .  A treatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that starts on or after the time of the first injection of 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359666] -up visit [ADDRESS_448717] a causal relationship with exposure to the investigational agent .  A TEAE can therefore be 
any unfavourable and unintend ed sign (includ ing an abnormal laboratory find ing), symptom, or 
disease temporally associat ed with the exposure to  the IMP, whether or not consider ed related 
to that product.   
The subjects will be closely observ ed and question ed for any kind of AE dur ing the study 
procedures and at follow -up appointments throughout the study period with non -leading 
questioning (e.g., “How do you feel?”).  The subjects will be instruct ed to immediately report 
any symptoms and signs to the study staff (i.e., between formal observations).  
Both the investigator(s) and Sponsor/CRO will perform a causality assessment on a ny AE, to 
assess whether or not there is a reasonable possibility (evidence to suggest) that the IMP 
caused the event.   
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  A reasonable possibility exists for causality between the IMP 
and the AE . 
Laboratory AE Evaluation  
Interpretation and follow -up of abnormal laboratory test results should be conduct ed in 
consideration of the clinical situation of the subject.  Any abnormal laboratory find ings that 
constitute an AE should be report ed as such and should be follow ed up until the o utcome is 
known.  Also, additional diagnostic tests may be indicat ed to determine a more precise 
diagnosis of the subject’s condition (e.g., order ing a WBC differential to help characterise a GE-265-303 CPR REV A03
Version 1.0 Approved  22 Jul 2021

high or low WBC count, or order ing a determination of r ed cell indices to help characterise a 
low haematocrit) ; see also Section 10.2.8 (Other Significant Adverse Events) . 
10.2.7 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious advers e event (SAE) is defined as any AE that: 
• Results in death.  
• Is life threaten ing (requires that, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, the 
adverse event occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an adverse event or suspect ed adverse reaction that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caus ed death). 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359667].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is another important medical event.* 
*Other important medical events are those that may not result in death, be life threaten ing, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but may be consider ed an SAE wh en, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes list ed above.   
For this Study, it is expected that the follow ing may occur:  
• Observations and find ings (previou sly unknown) discover ed during the ICA, and 
medically assess ed as most likely pre -existing (e.g., coronary artery occlusions).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359668] 24 hours for the ICA (without an AE) may be 
necessary for other reasons (non -AE) e.g., patient -convenience . 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359669] -ICA interventions deem ed necessary follow ing the ICA 
(without an AE) may occur (e.g., patient kept in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_359670] -
existing coronary artery occlusions discover ed during ICA). 
For this study, these types of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131954]/or imag ing findings will not be consider ed 
AEs or SAEs and will not be report ed as such in the CRFs.  
10.2.8 Other Significant Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory abnormalities that qualify as AEs (other than those meeting the defini tion 
for serious) and any events that lead to an intervention (includ ing premature discontinuation of GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

IMP, dose reduction or significant additional concomitant therapy), other than those reported as 
SAEs, will be report ed and evaluat ed as other significant  AEs. 
10.2.9 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse E vent Reporting 
All AEs/SAEs shall be recorded in the AE/SAE report form  using acceptable diagnoses, if 
possible.  If an AE has already been report ed, it is not necessary to report each individual sign 
and symptom of that AE as a separate AE.  For example, if myocardial infarction ( MI) is 
reported as an AE, there is no ne ed to report elevat ed creatine kinase and abnormal ECG, or 
other relat ed signs, sympto ms, or laboratory values as separate AEs.  However, if both 
occurred in isolation and MI was not diagnosed, then each event would be report ed as an AE.  
The intensity of all AEs will be grad ed as mild, moderate, or severe us ing the follow ing 
definitions:  
Mild: Tolerable.  
Moderate:  Interferes with normal activity.  
Severe: Incapacitat ing (causes inability to perform usual activity or work).  
The investigator will be instruct ed to closely monitor each subject who experiences an AE 
(whether ascrib ed to the IMP or  not) until the outcome of the AE has been determined.  
In addition to the investigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encod ed by [CONTACT_429]/CRO accord ing to a well-recognised dictionary of medical codes , e.g., Medical 
Dictionary for Regulat ory Activities ( MedDRA ). 
All AEs/SAEs must be follow ed for a final outcome until the end of the follow -up period.  An 
outcome of “unknown” is not consider ed to be an acceptable final outcome.  An outcome of 
“not yet resolved” is an acceptable final outcome  for non-serious AEs at the end of a subject’s 
participation in a study, and for SAEs at database lock.  
Study centres are instructed to report all SAEs, together with a causality assessment, to 
the Sponsor (or a service provider /CRO acting on behalf of the Sponsor) within [ADDRESS_448718] the Medical Director:

Subjects enroll ed at sites in the European Union will be provid ed with a Clinical Trial 
Participant card at the time of IMP administration .  This card will list contact [CONTACT_359768] (Clinical Trial 
Emergency Contact [CONTACT_359769] [CTECS]) .  The CTECS provides 24-hour, 7-day-a-week 
emergency cover service for Healthcare professionals to seek advice on trial –related medical 
questions or problems should a medical emergency arise and the investigator is not available.  
10.2.10 Urgent Safety Measures 
In accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice ( GCP) as laid out in the 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6, the investigator(s) has/have primary 
responsibility for assur ing subject safety throughout the performance of study proce dures.  An 
urgent safety measure is defin ed as any measure which an investigator may ne ed to implement 
which is a deviation from, or a change in, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
trial subjects without prior IEC/IRB approval/favourable o pi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
The investigator may take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect the subjects of 
a clinical trial against any immediate hazards to their health or safety.  However, the 
investigator must inform the Sponsor/CRO within 24 hours of hav ing taken such measures.  
The Sponsor in turn shall immediately, and in any event no later than 3 days from the date the 
measures are taken, give written notice to the licens ing authority and the relevant IEC/IRB of 
the measures taken and the circumstances giving rise to those measures.  
All urgent safety measures must be report ed to the Sponsor/CRO by [CONTACT_359770] 10.2.9 within 24 hours of hav ing to take such a measure(s) .  Such reports can 
be initiated by [CONTACT_359771] (by [CONTACT_359772]) and must include detai ls of what measures were taken and the circumstances giv ing rise to 
those measures.  
10.2.11 Pregnancy Reporting 
This process is aim ed at ensuring the appropriate monitor ing of the potential risk relat ed to 
IMP exposure of pregnant women and/or foetuses as well as the risks associat ed with exposure GE-265-[ADDRESS_448719] ing congenital abnormalities or birth defects in their offspring.  It also 
ensures compliance with applicable international and local regulations.  
The requirements are applicable to all subjects follow ing exposure to IMP.  
Female trial subjects : The trial subject must be advis ed by [CONTACT_359773]/her 
immediately if she suspects she may be pregnant dur ing 1 month after dos ing.   
Male trial subjects : The trial subject must be advis ed by [CONTACT_359773]/her 
immediately if they suspect their partner became pregnant after the subject was administer ed 
IMP during [ADDRESS_448720] reports a pregnancy (post -IMP administration) to the investigator, a 
pregnancy test should be arrang ed for the trial subject (or their partner) by [CONTACT_249305] [ADDRESS_448721] inform the Sponsor/CRO within [ADDRESS_448722] results by [CONTACT_359774] a copy of the relevant CRF page s (demography , exposure 
to medicinal products,  and/or AE) or via email.  The investigator should include an estimat ed 
date of conception when communicat ing with the Sponsor/CRO.  
10.[ADDRESS_448723] demographic data (date of birth /age, race, ethnicity, sex, weight, and height) will be 
recorded at Screening .  Subject age at the time of enrolment will be calculat ed from the date of 
birth and the date of baseline .  BMI will be calculat ed from height and weight.  If local 
regulations do not permit collection of specific demographic items (e.g., date of birth ), either 
age will be entered on the eCRF or a partial date will be us ed in accordance with local practice.

12.5 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
12.5.1 Efficacy Variables 
[IP_ADDRESS] Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Evaluations  
Three qualified readers (independent from the study) will perform independent reads of all 
MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359552]. The PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359673]-265-[ADDRESS_448729] and stress images will be rated for 
image quality and reviewed.  After the results of each individual MPI (PET or SPECT) are 
locked as the “blinded” read, then clinical information will be provided.  The reader will then 
be given the opportunity to submit a revised assessment of the existence of any perfusion 
defects as a n “unblinded” read . 
The primary efficacy read for MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359674] (18F) PET MPI (rest/stress) us ing perfusion and gat ed assessments from 
independent blind ed reads.  The overall qualitative diag nosis will be scor ed by [CONTACT_359780], ischaemic , ischaemic  + scar, or scar on the basis of the perfusion + 
gated images.  These scores will be dichotomis ed into MPI [CONTACT_117377] (normal) and MPI [CONTACT_95570] 
(ischaemic , ischaemic  + scar, or scar) for each subject and reader.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Coronary Angiography E valuations  
All coronary angiograms will be perform ed within [ADDRESS_448730] 
occurs prior to informed consent .  ICA data for the diagnosis of CAD will be generat ed by 
[CONTACT_13775]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Image Quality 
The data on image quality and interpretability will be collect ed separately dur ing the blinded 
read and will be analys ed separately by [CONTACT_359742].   
12.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints of the study are the sensiti vity and specificity of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] 
(18F) Injection PET MPI  [INVESTIGATOR_359675].  The truth 
standard us ed in this study is the presence of CAD as evidenc ed by [CONTACT_359740] 
≥50% in ≥1 coronary artery or major branch of a coronary artery  as determined by  [CONTACT_359781]. 
For each of the 3 readers, a binary decision will be derived by [CONTACT_359782] -negative or MPI -positive; sensitivity and specificity will then be 
calculated for each of the 3 readers.  
Sensitivity and specificity are defin ed as follows:  
• True Positives (TP): Subjects with abnormal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359676] 
• True Negatives (TN): Subjects with normal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359677]-265-303 CPR REV A03
Version 1.0 Approved  22 Jul 2021

Page 71 of 142 
• False Positives (FP): Subjects with abnormal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359678] 
• False Negatives (FN): Subjects with normal PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359676] 
• Sensitivity: TP/(TP + FN)  
• Specificity: TN/(TN + FP)  
• Accuracy: TN + TP/(TN + TP + FN + FP)  
A dosed subject whose PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359560] (i.e., a miss ing rest and/or stress 
image) will be exclud ed from the MITT analysis population .  Also, a subject with a miss ing 
truth standard will be exclud ed from the MITT analysis population .  A summary of reasons for 
all missing data will be provided, with number and percent in each category .  To eliminate bias 
between modalities, once a subject is includ ed in the MITT population, the readers will be 
asked to read SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359679], regardless of image quality and interpretability .  To indicate when a diagnosis is 
forced, the reader will record in the blinded-read CRF which images are consider ed 
uninterpre table. The data on image quality and interpretability will be collect ed separately 
during the blinded read and will be analys ed separately by [CONTACT_359742].  
12.5.3 Statistical Hypothesis, Model, and Method of Analysis 
The 2 primary efficacy endpoints are calculat ed as follows from different subsets of the 
population:  
• The calculation of sensitivity of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359680], per the standard of truth.   
• The calculation of specificity of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injectio n PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359681], per the standard of truth.   
Let s1 = true sensitivity of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI:  
[INVESTIGATOR_359564] p1 = true specificity of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI:  
[INVESTIGATOR_359682] a threshold of 60% in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI.  To 
meet the criteria for success in this study, both the sensitivity and the specificity of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] 
(18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359567] 60%.  Thus, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
confidence interval for both sensitivity and specificity must exce ed 60%. 
Therefore, the test of hypotheses will be as follows:  
H01 : s1 ≤ 0.60; H02: p1 ≤ 0.60, where s 1 is sensitivity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238] p1 is specificity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI.  GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

Ha1: s1 > 0.60; Ha2: p1 > 0.[ADDRESS_448731] with type 1 error (α)= 0.025.  The test will be bas ed on the 1-sample z-test for 
proportions , using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution .  The analysis will be 
done for each reader and for all readers.  If each null hypothesis is reject ed in the analysis of all 
readers or by [CONTACT_63931] 2 out of 3 readers, the study w ill be consider ed a statistical success .   
There will be no formal interim efficacy analysis for this study. 
A summary of diagnostic efficacy includ ing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive 
predictive value  (PPV), and negative predictive value  (NPV) will be provid ed along with 2-
sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) bas ed on the normal approximation to the binomial 
distribution (for each of sensitivity and specificity, if the null hypothesis above is reject ed by 
[CONTACT_941] z-test, then the lower bound of the  2-sided 95% CI will mathematically be above the 
threshold of 60%). 
12.5.4 Handling of Missing Values/C ensoring/Discontinuations  
Missing values will not be imputed, and only observ ed values will be us ed in data analyses and 
reports, unless otherwise specifi ed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .   
12.5.[ADDRESS_448732] of missing data on the primary 
analysis results (i.e. , patients in the ITT population with incomplete PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359683]). Details will be prov ided in the SAP.  
The summary outlined in Section 12.5.3 will be provided for each modality separately and for 
the following subgroups:  
• Age groups (<65 years and ≥65 years)  
• BMI <30 kg/m2 and BMI ≥30 kg/m2 
• Diabetic and nondiabetic  
• Sex (male and fema le) 
• Race (White, Black or African -American, other)  
• Presence or absence of multivessel CAD  (per the standard of truth)  
• Presence or absence of renal impairment (i.e., serum creatinine level at predose evaluation 
is above normal range)  GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

changed after clinical information was made available will be presented by [CONTACT_359742].  
12.5.[ADDRESS_448733] MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359685]. Intra -
reader reproducibility will be determin ed based on a re-read of images from approximately 
10% of the subjects, select ed at random from all study subjects.  Each reader will re -read the 
same subset of images.  
12.6 Secondary Analys es 
12.6.1 Secondary Efficacy Variables and A nalyses 
The secondary endpoints in this study are the diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity and specificity) of 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359686], when the detection of 
CAD as defin ed by [CONTACT_359737], for the follow ing sets of subjects:

• Female subjects  
• Subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 
• Diabetic subjects  
To control the false -positive rate at a 1-sided 0.[ADDRESS_448734] ed at a 1-sided 0.025 level of significance; when a statistical test for a 
given endpoint fails to reach statistical significance in the appropriate direction, test ing on all 
remaining secondary endpoints in the hierarchy will cease and the study will be consider ed 
successful on all secondary endpoints up to that point.   GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

Page 74 of 142 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothesis Testing for the K ey Secondary Endpoint 
In the secondary efficacy analysis, the criteria for success will be the statistical superiority of 
sensitivity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359569], and the 
noninferiority of specificity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359569], 
when the detection of CAD by [CONTACT_359737] . Since the sensitivity calculation 
includes only the subjects with CAD and the sp ecificity analysis includes only the subjects 
without CAD, the analysis of sensitivity and specificity will be separate, as follows :   
Let s1 = sensitivity in Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI, and s 2 = sensitivity in SPECT MPI.  
Let p1 =specificity in Fl urpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI, and p 2 = specificity in SPECT MPI.  
Therefore, the test of hypotheses will be as follows:  
H01: s1 − s2 ≤ 0, H02: p1 − p2 ≤ −0.1 
Ha1: s1 − s2 > 0, Ha2: p1 − p2 > –0.[ADDRESS_448735] with a 
type l error (α) = 0.025. 
The tests of comparisons are bas ed on paired responses , as the Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET 
MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359687] a within -subject basis, and the images will be read 
by [CONTACT_359783] a cross -over design .  The test of sensitivity comparison between 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359571] a 1-sided 
McNemar's test at α = 0.025.  Similarly, the test of specificity noninferiority between 
Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359571] a paired test for 
noninferiority [Liu et al 2002] at a 1-sided α = 0.025.  The criterion for the demonstration of 
diagnostic efficacy for the seconda ry endpoint s will be meet ing the tests of hypotheses for both 
sensitivity and specificity for the same [ADDRESS_448736] in the targeted population for comparison to Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359688].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothesis test ing for other secondary endpoint s 
The methodology us ed for evaluating diagnostic efficacy within these populations will be 
similar to that used for analysis of the key secondary endpoint .   GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

The sample size was calculat ed to ensure that a sufficient number of evaluable negative and 
positive patients (by [CONTACT_88622]) are enroll ed to achieve 90% power at a 1-sided significance level of 
0.025 for both sensitivity and specificity in the primary analysis.  Assuming the true sensitivity 
and true specificity are both 70%, and test ing the hypothesis that they are both > 60%, 
237 negative and 237 positive patients in the MITT population are required.  Assum ing a 
prevalence of 43%, approximately 552 total patients will be  enrolled to ensure there are

15 APPENDICES  
15.1 Information on Investigational and Register ed Products  
The reference document for  the IMP in  this study is the current IB.  The reference document 
provides up -to-date information on the efficacy and safety of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection and is 
used for assess ing expectedness of Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, in order to determine 
regulatory reportability.  An unexpect ed adverse drug reaction is a reaction for which the 
nature, seriousness, severity or outcome is not consistent with the IB.   
GE Healthcare marketed medicinal products like Myoview (99mTc based SPECT MPI [CONTACT_119944]) 
and Rapi[CONTACT_39710] (a pharmacological stress agent) may be used in this trial.  Reference safety 
information for assessment of expectedness are company core safet y information, and 
approved SmPC or US P ackage Insert in the country of occurrence.  
No expectedness assessment will be performed for other medicinal products.

ECG = electrocardiogram; PTP = pre -test probability; SCAD = stable coronary artery disease.  
a Probabilities of obstructive coronary disease shown reflect the estimates for patients aged 35, 45, 55, 65, 75 and

• Groups in white boxes have a PTP <15% and hence can be managed without further testing.  
• Groups in blue boxes have a PTP of 15–65%. They could have an exercise ECG if feasible as the initial test. 
However, if local expertise and availability permit a non -invasive imaging based test for ischaemia this 
would be preferable given the superior diagnostic capabilities of such tests. In young patients radiation issues 
should be considered.  
• Groups in light red boxes have PTPs between 66 –85% and hence should have a non -invasive imaging 
functional test for making a diagnosis of SCAD.  
• In groups in dark red boxes the PTP is >85% and one  can assume that SCAD is present. They need risk 
stratification only.

16 CLINICAL PROTOCOL AM ENDMENT SUMMARIES  
16.1 Amendment A01  
16.1.1 Reasons for Amendment  
• LVEF <50% has been removed from exclusion criterion (8) .  The purpose of ex clusion 
criterion 8 is to eliminate known/confirmed heart failure.  The inclusion of an EF lower 
limit to specify which patients should be included does not address this aim.  Ejection 
fraction defines different heart failure phenotypes ( e.g. heart failure  with preserved, 
reduced or mid -range ejection fraction)  and as such is not relevant to the aim of 
excluding those with a heart failure diagnosis as a whole.   Even if the purpose was to 
exclude only patients with reduced EF, the EF of 50% corresponds to ‘n ormal’ EF 
when echocardiography is performed but does not correspond to the  appropriate value 
to demark normal and abnormal ejection fractions for other modalities such as SPECT.  
• Clarification of follow -up period for the study.   
• Clarification of medicinal products in the study and update of storage and handling 
conditions for Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) Injection.   
• Corrections to text to ensure recording of concurrent medications to study completion.  
• Removal of requirement for drug and alcohol screening.   Drug and alcohol abuse 
screening is useful to address: (1) unique safety concerns associated with potential 
interactions of IMP with illicit drugs, (2) concerns regarding confounding of an efficacy 
signal, and (3) concerns that follow -up would be compromis ed given occult substa nce 
abuse.   
GE Healthcare  feels that these concerns are minimal, given:  (1) There are no unique 
concerns regarding drug / illicit drug interactions .  This is particular ly the case given 
that Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359692]  (as opposed to repeatedly) at a 
tracer dose. (2) Concerns of confounding the correlation between the anatomical gold 
standard of the QCA and the PET MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359693].  It is possible that 
toxic effects of illicit drugs (such as co caine) could affect the microvascular function 
that in turn could lead to perfusion abnormalities as seen on MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359694].  GE Healthcare  believes 
that these discrepancies are likely to be minimal and encountered infrequently . 
(3) Subjects are already screened for psychiatric conditions which could impair 
participation in all study visits (exclusion #12).  Substance abuse is an axis II disorder 
and investigators are counselled to exclude patients with ongoing drug abuse that may 
lead to poor compliance in the manual of procedures.   Given the short -term follow -up 
of this study, it is unlikely that occult subs tance abuse (missed as part of the medical 
history) would frequently impair patient follow up.  
Since we believe that active substance abuse  is likely to be rare and to have minimal if 
any effect on efficacy, no effect on safety,  and minimal if any effect o n follow-up 
compliance,  the collection of this sensitive health information is not justified . GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

• Guidance regarding use of beta -blocker therapy has been added.   To ensure that the 
PET and SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359695] w ith 
standard clinical care, study sites are advised to withhold the beta -blocker when 
possible for at least [ADDRESS_448753].  Evidence demonstrate s that beta-
blockade at the time of stress testing may reduce the sensitivity of MPI.  GE Healthcare 
acknowledge s that withholding the beta -blocker might not always be possible due to 
clinical concerns such as difficult to control hypertension or arrhythmia (as per the 
guidelines) [Dorbala et al. 2013] .  In patients using beta blockers , the investigator must 
discuss with the treating physician the safety of withholding the beta-blocker.  Subjects 
who require continued beta -blockade during MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359696].  
• Clarification that an additional blood sample at screening may be analysed by [CONTACT_359788].  Dependence on central lab 
results for screening purposes will result in a delay from screening to the earliest 
performance of in study visits (including the PET or on -study SPECT) of at least  
48 hours from the time of the lab draw (in most cases).  This delay adds a significant 
hurdle to patient recruitment and retainment in a study where all study visits must occur 
prior to a prescheduled invasive coronary angiography .  In most cases the window 
between screening and the clinical intracoronary angiography is expected to be less 
than [ADDRESS_448754] scan in a minimal amount of time (or even in the 
same day) with a PET scan following as closely after as doses are available.  Central 
labs results may still be used for screening if local labs are not drawn.  The 
determination of whether to draw local labs for this purpose rests with the investigator 
and will depend on the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_359697] (e.g. if the 
window between screening and ICA is brief, local labs are advis ed, if this window is 
more lengthy than local labs should not be drawn).  
Significant discordance between local and central lab results are unlikely since the 
central and local labs will be drawn in the same sitting at screening.  If they do occur 
the local lab should take precedence for the screening purposes.  The safety data set will 
use the exclusively the central labs to analyse changes in biochemistry, since  all 
patients will systematically have labs analysed centrally at screening and pre - and post-
scan timepoints. Listings and summary tables will describe the local lab data.

Section 9.1, Screening Visit  
Previously read:  
All screening assess ments will occur within [ADDRESS_448771] be mindful 
of the 60-day window between screening and ICA procedures.  The following will be done 
during the screening period:  
• Signed and dated ICF must be obtained from all subjects prior to their entering the study.  
Study informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to the initiation of any 
study-related procedures. Rest and stress SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359710] (i.e., “off -study” SPECT) can be used if the SPECT MPI [INVESTIGATOR_359711] a camera 
that had already been validated for use in the study. 
• Medical and surgical history will be checked and recorded.  This medical history will 
include any significant past or present illnesses, by [CONTACT_6764], as well as a complete 
cardiac history (including 5 -year general medical history) and a pretest l ikelihood of CAD. 
The pretest likelihood of CAD will be derived from the European Society of Cardiology 
(ESC) guidelines on the management of stable CAD [Montalescot et al 2013]  (see 
Appendix 15.4).  In addition, a Seattle Angina Questionnaire [Spertus et al 1995]  (see 
Appendix 15.5) will be administered . 
• Demographic information will be recorded.  
• Subjects will be screened for current illicit drug and/or alcohol abuse.  
• Blood and urine samples will be collected for assessing haematology, abnormal glucose 
metabolism, liver or renal insufficiency, and alcohol  and drug screening.  
• All subjects must satisfy all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed in 
Sections 7.2 and 7.3.   
• For women of childbearing potential, the results of either a urine or serum  human chorionic 
gonadotropin pregnancy test (with the result known on the day of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359532] (18F) 
Injection) must be negative; these subjects must be instructed to practice appropriate birth 
control from time of the screening to 30 days after the Flurpir idaz (18F) Injection.  A 
pregnancy test is not needed for women who are either surgically sterile (has a documented 
bilateral tubal ligation and oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy) or post -
menopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year).   
• 12-lead ECG recording will be performed. (A clinically indicated ECG performed within 
[ADDRESS_448772] pain or instability, can be 
used as the Screening ECG).  
Waivers or protocol exceptions will not be grant ed prospectively by [CONTACT_359760].  Any exceptions to protocol -specified requirements will be considered as

Section 10.2.6, Adverse Events (previously Treatment -emergent Adverse Events)  
Previously read:  
Study per sonnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs, particularly those that may be 
life threatening.  Personnel who are trained in the acute management of anaphylaxis and other 
emergencies and who have access to appropriate clinical supplies must be imm ediately 
available for 1 hour  after dosing.  Treatment of SAEs should be primarily supportive of vital 
functions.  
AE Definition:  An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence or an already present 
event that worsens either in intensity or frequency.  A treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) is an AE which occurs temporally following exposure to the investigational agent.  A 
TEAE is defined as an AE that starts on or after the time of the first injection of Flurpi[INVESTIGATOR_359721] -up visit [ADDRESS_448799] a 
causal relationship with exposure to the investigational agent.  A TEAE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporal ly associated with the exposure to an IMP, whether or not considered related 
to that product.   
The subjects will be closely observed and questioned for any kind of AE during the study 
procedures and at follow -up appointments throughout the study period with non-leading GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

questioning (e.g., “How do you feel?”).  The subjects will be instructed to immediately report 
any symptoms and signs to the study staff (i.e., between formal observations).  
Both the investigator(s) and Sponsor/CRO will perform a causality  assessment on any AE, to 
assess whether or not there is a reasonable possibility (evidence to suggest) that the IMP 
caused the event.   
Adverse Reaction:  An AE that is caused by [CONTACT_2203].  
Suspected Adverse Reaction:  A reasonable possibility exists for causality between the IMP 
and the AE.  
Laboratory AE Evaluation  
Interpretation and follow -up of abnormal laboratory test results should be conducted in 
consideration of the clinical situation of the subject.  Any abnorma l laboratory findings that 
constitute an AE should be reported as such and should be followed up until the outcome is 
known.  Also, additional diagnostic tests may be indicated to determine a more precise 
diagnosis of the subject’s condition (e.g., orderin g a WBC differential to help characterise a 
high or low WBC count, or ordering a determination of red cell indices to help characterise a 
low haematocrit).  
Now reads:  
All AEs/SAEs that occur after informed consent shall be recorded in the AE/SAE report for m 
(see the Study Schedule of Events, Table 1).   
Study personnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs after administration of IMP 
(see Section 8.1), particularly those that may be life threatening.  Personnel who are trained in 
the acute management o f anaphylaxis and other emergencies and who have access to 
appropriate clinical supplies must be immediately available for 1 hour  after dosing.  Treatment 
of SAEs should be primarily supportive of vital functions.  
AE and TEAE  Definition:  An AE is defined a s any untoward medical occurrence or an

Section 10.2.9, Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Previously read:  
All AEs should be recorded using acceptable diagnoses, if possible.  If an AE has already been 
reported, it is not necessary to report each individual sign and sy mptom of that AE as a 
separate AE.  For example, if MI is reported as an AE, there is no need to report elevated 
creatine kinase and abnormal ECG, or other related signs, symptoms, or laboratory values as 
separate AEs.  However, if both occurred in isolati on and MI was not diagnosed, then each 
event would be reported as an AE.  
The intensity of all AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the following 
definitions:  GE-265-303 CPR REV A03

Mild: Tolerable.  
Moderate:  Interferes with normal activity.  
Severe: Incapacitating (causes inability to perform usual activity or work).  
The investigator will be instructed to closely monitor each subject who experiences an AE 
(whether ascribed to the IMP or not) until the outcome of the AE has been determined.  
In addition  to the investigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded by [CONTACT_429]/CRO according to a well -recognised dictionary of medical codes.  
SAEs will be recorded in the CRF if they occurred as follows:  
• After a subject first received an IMP an d throughout the subject’s follow -up period*, 
whether or not considered related to the IMP, and  
• After the subject’s follow -up period, and for which a causal relationship to the IMP 
cannot be ruled out.  
(*Follow-up period is defined as the protocol -stipulated period or, for subjects prematurely 
withdrawn from a study, the duration of a subject’s participation.)  
All serious and non -serious AEs must be followed for a final outcome until the end of the 
follow-up period.  An outcome of “unknown” is not considere d to be an acceptable final 
outcome.  An outcome of “not yet resolved” is an acceptable final outcome for non -serious 
AEs at the end of a subject’s participation in a study, and for SAEs at database lock.  
Study centres are instructed to report all SAEs, to gether with a causality assessment, to

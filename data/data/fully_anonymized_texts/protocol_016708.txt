 Page 5 of 17 Version 1.4 dated 7.13.18  2.0 Objectives  
2.1 The pi[INVESTIGATOR_315204], implement, and evaluate a physical 
activity program in both the school and home setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
3.0 Background  
3.1 COVID-19 has created numerous challenges to children’s ability to engage in healthy lifestyles. The need for physical distancing creates barriers to many types of physical activity children typi[INVESTIGATOR_315205]. The school setting is an essential source of children’s physical activity and the recent move of school education from in-person to online eliminated over half of children’s daily physical activity. Since the COVID -[ADDRESS_387875] major implications for long term health, it is more important than ever to provide safe opportunities for children from low -income families to engage in active lifestyles.  
The 2020-2021 school year in the Kansas City area will create numerous challenges to teachers and other school personnel. Whether classes will be conducted online, in-person, or using a mix of the two approaches is still unknown, but all approaches will substantially limit opportunities for children to engage in healthy lifestyles. Schools will be forced to  constantly adapt to new 
procedures that prevent the spread of infection. These challenges will make it even more difficult for elementary schools to support children’s health and physical activity. 
In addition to supporting health, the activities reenergize students 
and improve attention, learning, and positive behavior in the classroom. Teachers are trained and supported to deliver additional activities throughout the week, but our physical activity leaders minimize burden on the teache rs as we acknowledge that teachers 
are in a particularly challenging situation due to the pandemic. 
 
4.0 Study Endpoints  
4.1 The primary endpoints are daily step counts and daily physical 
activity minutes.  
4.2 The secondary endpoints are parent and teacher perceptions . 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
5.1 This study will be conducted in in -school and out-of-school 
settings.  
5.2 Arm 1 (CBPA):  
SHORT TITLE: Stay Active  
 Page 6 of 17 Version 1.4 dated 7.13.18  •  CBPA: P hysical activity support is provided by [CONTACT_315208] a video conferencing platform in partnership with the classroom teacher. Activities last about [ADDRESS_387876]. The activities will be delivered by a research staff member via video conferencing (using the schools preferred platform). A combination of live activities led by [CONTACT_315209]-recorded vide os will be used  (see example below).  If live videos do 
not work for the teacher, they will have the option to only use the pre-recorded videos or receive a list of resources to promote CBPA 
in their classrooms.  
Teachers will be asked to complete weekly a weekly REDCap 
survey to track the amount of CBPA they offered to their class outside of the time study staff provided physical activity support. Teachers will also be asked to complete one post -study survey and 
interview  to provide their perceptions of the Stay Active program.  
 
Study staff will provide an optional training session for teacher to 
walk through the importance of CBPA, as well as accessing the resources that will be provided to them. This training will be accessible through live videoconference or a PowerPoint presentation sent via email.  
 
 
5.3 Arm 2 (CBPA plus family): 

SHORT TITLE: Stay Active  
 Page 7 of 17 Version 1.4 dated 7.13.18  • CBPA component will be identical to above. 
• Family Component: A newsletter , with supporting handouts and 
resources for the family to use, will be sent to parents or guardians 
once every two weeks over the semester and posted on the study website. The newsletters include physical activity information related to safety/protection, skills building, motivation, overcoming barriers, and goal setting and monitoring. The handouts include optional worksheets and physical activity tracking sheets to support families. As part of the program, children also receive a Garmin wearable physical activity monitor. Parents or guardians will receive text messages with behavior change messages based on the Garmin data. Text messages also contain links to website materials. Parents/Guardians of students 
who receive a Garmin will receive text reminders about wearing the device if no steps or minutes of physical ac tivity are being 
detected.  
Texts will be sent out using the Twilio platform.  
Participants (both parent and child) will be asked to complete two surveys during the study. Surveys ask questions related to general demographics, household physical activity habits, and COVID-[ADDRESS_387877] survey has been submitted in the SmartForm (Baseline Survey_Version_0.02), the second survey will be submitted later as an amendment, as it is still being developed.

13.1 Up to 15 Kansas City school teachers  and classrooms.  
13.2 Up to 250 students (4th and 5th graders ), 250 parent(s)/guardian(s), 
and 15 teachers  
14.0 Screening and Recruitment Methods  
14.1 Classrooms 
• We will work with district contacts to identify schools and 
classrooms to participate.  
• A study information letter will be sent out via multiple modes of 
communication to schools and teachers.  
• Study staff will communicate with the leader in the district who has 
authority to approve the project. The leader then identifies the classrooms and relays what classrooms have been selected  to study staff. 
14.2 Participants 
• A recruitment flyer  will be sent out via multiple modes of 
communication  to all families of 4
th and 5th grade students in 
SHORT TITLE: Stay Active  
 Page 11 of 17 Version 1.4 dated 7.13.18  classrooms of selected teachers that are participating . The 
recruitment flyer will be sent by [CONTACT_315211].   
• The recruitment flyer will describe the CBPA as all students in the 
classroom (even those who do not wear the Garmin device) will be able to participate in the CBPA if desired. The recruitment flyer will explain that such students/families can opt out of receiving the CBPA by [CONTACT_315212]. These students will not complete any study assessments.  
• The recruitment flyer will also describe the Garmin assessment portion of the study and the potential family content that half of the classrooms will be randomized. To enroll in the Garmin portion of the study participants will need to opt in by [CONTACT_315213]. Thus, these are the study participants who will be consented/assented and measured/assessed.  
 
• Research staff will respond via email or telephone to inquiries generated by [CONTACT_315214]. The research team will go over the details of the study with potential participants over the phone or email. If a potential participant says they want to enroll in the study after receiving the study information, having any questions answered by [CONTACT_253475], and being confirmed as eligible, the parent and child will be 
consented and  assented over the phone. E- consent will then officially take 
place over the phone and REDCap.  The participant will receive a copy of 
the P/A/C form and participant instructions by e- mail or  in the mail.

by [CONTACT_315215]. Payment will be issued to the participant when they complete the study and complete the f inal 
survey.  15.[ADDRESS_387888].  
 
17.0 Risks to Subjects  
17.1 Classroom: 
• The primary risk, albeit minimal, is the risk of loss of confidentiality. The use of video conferencing could result in a potential loss of privacy, but study staff will be using the schools video conferencing system to minimize this risk. 
17.2 Participants: 
• The risk to the child’s comfort, albeit minimal, is the wearing of the device daily  on their wrists.  
• There is a risk to the participant of loss of privacy due to the 
Garmin bei ng a consumer device that uploads data to Garmin 
servers.  
• There is a slight risk of loss of privacy due to the use of Twilio as 
the text messaging platform.  
• There is a slight risk of burden to the parents or guardians due to the text messaging frequency. 
18.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
18.1 Participants will benefit from resources and opportunities provided 
on how to be physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic.

1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions 
Protocol Date 
Original 14 February 2014
Amendment 1 25 April 2014
Amendment 2 15 October 2014
Amendment 3 06 May 2015
The purpose of this amendment is to: 
●Revise, clarify and describe in more detail the overall study design and plan.
Rationale:   With more safety data available on Atrasentan and considering the 
study objectives, it was determined the selection criteria can be amended to 
enhance participation in the trial while maintaining subject's safety.
The changes are as follows:
Study Design Changes:
●Broaden the duration of the screening period to up to 4 weeks
Rationale:   Allow time for repeat testing and potential subject schedule
●Redefine visit windows.
Rationale:   Enhance subject compliance to the visit schedule.
●Remove collection of duplicate semen samples at T4/Week 6 visit Rationale:   Align semen sample collection with the spermatogenesis cycle to 
every 13 weeks.
●Remove collection of duplicate semen samples at T6/EOT visit if subjects 
prematurely discontinues study drug as a result of entering the Observational Period
Rationale:   it is determined collection of semensamples from these subjects is 
not necessary as these subjects would be providing two sets of semen samples 
within [ADDRESS_706259] 2016-000722-19
3
●Remove Week 6 visit from the Observational Period
Rationale:   Align semen sample collection to spermatogenesis cycle every 
13 weeks.
●Replace the O5/EOS visit with a phone contact [CONTACT_541517] 15% of baseline or above
Rationale:   Safety can be adequately monitored via a telephone contact.
●Update the following study procedures
○Move Physical Examination to the T1/Day 1 visit from Screening.
○Add measurement of hormone levels to the T1/Day 1 visit
○Remove lipid profile assessments
○Update the requirement for two FMV urine collections to one FMV urine 
collection during the Screening Period
○Update the requirement for limited chemistry to completed chemistry at 
each visit during the Observational Period
○Move Hb A1c and urinalysis to the O1/Week 13 visit from the 
EOS/Week 52 visit 
Rationale:   Ensure appropriate timing of baseline physical examination 
(immediately before first dose administration) and eliminate laboratory tests that have been deemed not necessary based on study objectives.
●Study Design Clarifications:
○Individual tests may be repeated within the screening window instead of a 
full rescreening of all procedures.
○Provide clear direction on when a subject enters the Observational Period
○Provide clear definition of when the follow-up contact [CONTACT_541518]:
●Inclusion Criterion 3:  remove requirement for being on a stable dose of ACE 
or ARB prior to the Screening Period.
Rationale:   Align with scientific objectives of the study while maintaining the 
target study population

●Inclusion Criterion 4:  lowered eGFR criterion to ≥ 35 mL/min/1.73 m2
Rationale:   To expand the study population to subjects that are more closely 
aligned with the target atrasentan population.
●Inclusion Criterion 6:  increase the upper limit of SBP to 180 mmHg
Rationale:   To accept expected fluctuations in blood pressure and align with 
blood pressure targets across atrasentan studies.
●Inclusion Criterion 7:  increase the serum potassium upper limit to 6.0 mEq/LRationale:   To accept expected fluctuations in serum chemistry 
●Inclusion Criterion 10:  streamline description for male contraception 
requirements
Rationale:   details are provided in Section 5.2.4of the protocol
●Inclusion Criterion 15:  redefine acceptable testosterone levels 
Rationale:   subjects with kidney disease have lower levels of testosterone that 
may not correlate with baseline sperm concentration 
●Inclusion Criterion 16:  lessen required duration for being on alpha-blockers to 
at least 2 weeks prior to the initial screening visit.
Rationale:   Two weeks of alpha-blockers is considered stable treatment for the 
purposes of excluding effect on spermatogenesis

treatment.
Rationale:   History of resolved infection is not confounding to the inclusion of 
the target patient population
●Exclusion Criterion 8:  lessen duration of drug, alcohol or substance abuse to 
3 months prior to the initial screening.
Rationale:   Three months of lack of abuse is a reasonable timeframe to 
determine subject's potential compliance with study requirements.

●Exclusion Criterion 11:  only exclude subjects who are currently receiving or 
have received hormone replacement therapy within the 6 months prior to the 
initial screening visit.
Rationale:   Past hormone therapy use is not confounding to the study 
objective; only subjects with current or recent use need to be excluded.
●Exclusion Criterion 15:  remove moderate edema and pulmonary edema and to 
revise the required time frame to 4 weeks prior to the initial screening visit
Rationale:   A subject with a history of pulmonary edema, which would be 
identified as part of the diagnosis of heart failure, would not be allowed into 
the study per Exclusion Criterion 17.  Adequate medical management of 
peripheral or facial edema within the [ADDRESS_706264] eligibility at the initial screening visit. 
●Selection Criteria Clarifications:

1.2 Synopsis
[COMPANY_013] Protocol Number:   M12-919
Name [CONTACT_26323]:   Atrasentan Phase of Development:   2
Name [CONTACT_3261]:  Atrasentan Date of Protocol Synopsis:   08 April 2016
Protocol Title:  A Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of the Effects of Atrasentan on Spermatogenesis and 
Testicular Function
Objectives:   The study objective is to evaluate the effect of Atrasentan on spermatogenesis and 
testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 20 sites.
Study Population:   Subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes and nephropathy (e-GFR ≥ 35 ml/min/1.73 m2
and a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine and < 5,000 mg/g 
(≥3.4 mg/mmol and < 565 mg/mmol)).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 
15 evaluable subjects.
Methodology:
This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study.  Eligible subjects will be treated with 
Atrasentan 0.75 mg once daily (QD) for 26 weeks while remaining on their RAS inhibitors.  Semen samples will be collected at Screening (baseline), Week 13 and Week 26/End of Treatment (EOT) visits.  Semen samples will be collected at two time-points over a 7-day period with each sample being separated by [CONTACT_2669] 2 days (48 hours) for each scheduled collection period.  The average of the 2 semen samples will be used as the value for that collection period.  If at any time during the Treatment Period or at the Week 26/EOT visit, the subjects' sperm concentration drops below 15 million/mL, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and enter into an Observational Period of up to an additional 52 weeks.  If at the end of the 26-Week Treatment Period, there is a ≥ 50% reduction in sperm 
concentration from baseline, the subject will enter into the Observational Period.  During the Observational Period semen samples will be collected (at two time-points over a 7-day period with each sample being separated by [CONTACT_2669] 2 days [48 hours]) every [ADDRESS_706272]'s sperm concentration returns to within 15% of baseline or above, or until the end of the Observational Period.  Subjects who do not meet the criteria to enter the Observational Period will have a follow-up contact [CONTACT_541521] (or designee) [ADDRESS_706273] dose of study drug.  Subjects, whose sperm concentration returns to within 15% of baseline or above during the Observational Period, will have a follow-up contact [CONTACT_541521] (or designee) within 14 days of the collection of the 
second semen sample.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Safety (Continued):
Secondary Safety Measures up to the End of Study:
!The proportion of subjects who enter the Observational Period and do not return to within 15% 
of baseline or above during the 52-week Observational Period.  
!Change from baseline to each visit in sperm concentration.
!Change from baseline to each visit in each of the components of the semen analysis (sperm motility, sperm morphology, sperm count, semen volume).
!Change from baseline to each visit in serum testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, and inhibin B.
Pharmacokinetic:
Atrasentan apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) may be estimated using 
population pharmacokinetic techniques.
Statistical Methods:
Analysis Datasets:
The following datasets will be used for the analysis of safety endpoints:
!The Evaluable Set will consist of all subjects who achieve the following:  1) ≥ 70% overall 
study drug compliance; and 2) having completed the 26-week treatment period and having all 
planned sperm samples collected; or having a sperm concentration value < 15 × 106/mL 
observed by [CONTACT_541522].
!The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of Atrasentan.
Sample Size Justification:
The proportion of subjects with sperm concentration < 15 × 106/mL in an unscreened population of 
healthy male subjects is reported to be approximately 10%.  With [ADDRESS_706277] approximately 80% power to detect a 20% difference between the incidence 
rates in the Atrasentan group and the null hypothesis of 10% at 2-sided significance level of 0.2.
Safety:
Primary Safety Analysis:   
The primary safety analysis will be conducted on the evaluable set for the primary safety endpoint.  The 
simple percentage of subjects and a 2-sided 80% exact confidence interval will be calculated.  When [ADDRESS_706278] a sperm concentration < 15 × 10
6/mL, the 
trial will claim that Atrasentan has a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint.
Secondary Safety Analysis: 
The secondary analysis on the proportion of subjects who enter the Observational Period and do not 
return to within 15% of baseline or above during the 52-week Observational Period will be performed on the evaluable set.  The other secondary safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety population.  For proportion endpoints, the simple percentage of subjects and a 2-sided exact 80% confidence interval will 
be calculated.
The continuous variable of the secondary endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_19462] (N), mean, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Adverse Events (AEs) Analysis:
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Treatment-
emergent AEs (i.e., AEs that begin or worsen in severity after initiation of study drug) throughout the [ADDRESS_706280] dose of the study drug will be summarized in descending order by [CONTACT_6213], as well as by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and MedDRA preferred term.  The incidence rates of treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized.  Additionally, the treatment-emergent AEs will 
also be summarized by [CONTACT_541523].
The adverse events reported as reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.  Serious adverse events 
will be evaluated in a similar manner.
For the Observational Period, the protocol related AEs will be summarized similarly from [ADDRESS_706281] dose of study drug through study completion.  The number and percentage of subjects who report 
protocol-related adverse events in the Observational Period will also be summarized.
Laboratory Data:For each laboratory test, the mean change from baseline to the minimum, maximum, and to each visit 
will be summarized.  Additionally for selected laboratory tests of particular interests, the number and percentage of subjects whose laboratory value has shifted from normal at baseline to abnormally high or low at final will be tabulated.  The mean change from baseline to each visit in vital signs, including 
weight, will be summarized.
Interim Analysis:
An interim analysis will be performed after all the subjects have completed or prematurely discontinued 
from the 26-week Treatment Period.  The database will be formally locked and versioned.  The primary, applicable secondary and other safety analyses will be performed on this version of the clinical database.  There is no need to adjust significance level since the only comparison is in the primary analysis which 
will be conducted using data from the 26-week Treatment Period.

3.0 Introduction
The endothelins (ET), first identified in 1988, are a family of three paracrine/autocrine 
peptide factors (ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3) produced in a variety of tissues.[ADDRESS_706294] 
equal affinity for all ET-related peptides.4,5  ETA receptors are primarily responsible for 
ET-1 mediated vasoconstriction, cell proliferation, and promotion of vascular remodeling.
6  ET Breceptors are thought to provide a mechanism for the removal of 
excessive endothelins; they may also modulate arterial tone, however, when ET-1 concentrations are elevated.
7
The roles for ET Aand ET Breceptor subtypes in renal and cardiovascular (CV) disease are

The drug substance ABT-627 [2R-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4S-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-1-(N,N-
di-(N-butyl)-aminocarbonyl-methyl)-pyrrolidine-3R-carboxylic acid] is an orally bioavailable, potent endothelin receptor antagonist with a high selectivity for the ET
A
receptor.[ADDRESS_706296] demonstrated that ABT-627 (Atrasentan) inhibits 
mitogen and vascular biological responses induced by [CONTACT_35754]-[ADDRESS_706297] to rats with experimental glomerulonephritis showed reduction in mesangial cell proliferation, supporting the hypothesis that ET-1 is a potent mitogen for mesangial cells.
17  In a rat model of diabetic nephropathy, Atrasentan treatment attenuated 
albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in association with reductions in glomerular permeability (and urine TGFb).
17,18  In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 
crossover study in 11 subjects with type 1 diabetes and proteinuria who were not receiving renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, (Study M96-499) Atrasentan 5 mg per day for 42 days resulted in a 65% reduction in urinary albumin excretion.  Mean arterial blood pressure (BP) was also reduced; however, there was only a weak correlation between change in BP and albuminuria reduction.  The most commonly experienced treatment-emergent adverse events in the Atrasentan group were peripheral edema (64%), rhinitis (36%) and headache (18%), whereas in the placebo group the rates were:  peripheral edema (0%), rhinitis (11%) and headache (56%).
In subsequent Study M10-815, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 
89 subjects with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria who were on stable doses of RAS inhibitors, treatment with Atrasentan 0.75 or 1.75 mg per day for 8 weeks resulted in significant reductions in the mean urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline for subjects taking 0.75 mg per day (42% reduction, 1-sided P= 0.023) and 
1.75 mg per day (35% reduction, 1-sided P= 0.073) compared to placebo 
(11% reduction), whereas subjects receiving 0.25 mg per day had a non-significant mean UACR reduction of 21% ( P= 0.291).  The most commonly experienced 
treatment-emergent adverse events were peripheral edema in 9% of placebo, 14% in

0.25 mg Atrasentan, 18% in 0.75 mg Atrasentan and 46% in the 1.[ADDRESS_706299] of which were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation from the study.  There was no statistical significant difference in serum concentration of ET-1 of those subjects receiving Atrasentan as compared to placebo.
In a series of Phase 2b, dose-ranging studies involving 255 subjects who were taking the 
maximum tolerated labeled daily dose (MTLDD) of RAS inhibitors (Studies M11-350,M12-812 and M12-830), the UACR lowering effect of Atrasentan was confirmed.  In Study M11-350 (RADAR), 153 subjects from the US, Canada and Taiwan, were randomized to placebo, 0.75 mg or 1.25 mg daily of Atrasentan for 12 weeks.  UACR reductions of 37.7% and 40.6% were observed with the respective doses (0.75 and 1.25 mg per day), compared to placebo ( P< 0.01).  In Study M12-812, of 54 Japanese 
subjects, doses of 0.75 and 1.25 mg daily resulted in 31.4% and 53.7% UACR reduction, respectively, compared to placebo.  In Study M12-830, of 48 subjects, doses of 0.5 and 1.25 mg daily resulted in 27.6% and 37.4% UACR reduction, respectively.  The most common adverse event was peripheral edema, which was not different among the treatment groups in all three studies.  There were three serious adverse events of congestive heart failure (1 [1.5%] in placebo, 1 [1.2%] in 0.75 mg and 1 [1.0%] in 1.25 mg groups).
The Phase 3 study (Study M11-352) is ongoing to characterize the safety and efficacy of 
Atrasentan in delaying renal disease progression in subjects with type [ADDRESS_706300] residual albuminuria while receiving MTLDD of RAS inhibitors.  The primary endpoint will be the time to doubling of serum creatinine or end stage renal disease (ESRD).
Effect of Atrasentan on Testicular Function in Clinical Studies
Because of the nonclinical findings affecting male fertility, a Phase 2a clinical study, 
Study M10-815, included assessment of the neurohormonal axis in a subset of male subjects.  These assessments evaluated FSH and inhibin B, which were measured at baseline and after [ADDRESS_706301] dose of study drug, mean FSH decreased in all groups during the 
30-day follow-up period, with greater decreases in all Atrasentan groups compared with placebo; the difference between placebo (least squares mean change of –0.03 mIU/mL) and the 0.75 mg Atrasentan group (–1.75 mIU/mL) was statistically significant (P= 0.002).  Mean inhibin B increased in all groups during the 30-day follow-up period, 
with smaller increases in all Atrasentan groups compared with placebo and with no statistically significant differences between groups.
One Phase 2b study, Study M12-812, also included evaluation of testosterone for all male 
subjects.  Mean testosterone levels measured at baseline were at the higher range of normal in all treatment groups (470 ng/dL in the Atrasentan 0.75 mg group, 513 ng/dL in the placebo group, and 584 ng/dL in the Atrasentan 1.25 mg group).  By [CONTACT_10585] 8, there was a decline in testosterone observed in both Atrasentan groups; however, a statistically significant decrease in testosterone from baseline was observed only in the Atrasentan 1.25 mg group (–83 ng/dL, P = 0.020 for difference from baseline) with a further 
statistically significant decline (–120 ng/dL from baseline) at post treatment follow-up visit compared with baseline visit observed only in this treatment group.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_541507] 1.[ADDRESS_706302] the end of treatment and at the follow-up visit, the mean values for all treatment groups remained within the normal range.
A Phase 2 study from the original prostate cancer clinical development program also 
included evaluation of testosterone levels.  Study M01-366 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 10 mg Atrasentan QD versus placebo QD in men with hormone-naïve prostate cancer who had undergone a radical prostatectomy, but had not begun hormonal therapy and who were exhibiting signs of biochemical failure defined as both prostate-specific antigen (PSA) between 0.4 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL and a PSA doubling time ≤ [ADDRESS_706303] 2016-000722-19
25
Weeks 2, 6, 12, and 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter.  One hundred ninety-nine men with 
a mean age of 65 years were enrolled.  Mean testosterone at baseline was within normal range and was similar between the treatment groups (approximately 354 ng/dL in the placebo group [n = 107] and approximately 372 ng/dL in the Atrasentan group [n = 111]).  The mean exposure to Atrasentan was 442 days.  Among all randomized subjects, the testosterone levels with Atrasentan were significantly increased relative to placebo at Week 12, Week 24, and Final Visit.  A subset of subjects enrolled into an open-label extension (OLE) study, during which all subjects received Atrasentan 10 mg, including those originally randomized to receive placebo.  Among those who entered the open-label extension study, in an analysis that compared groups according to their original randomization, at the Final Visit, there was a mean decrease in testosterone levels for the 72 subjects originally randomized to Atrasentan (–54 ng/dL) that was statistically significantly different ( P= 0.008) from a small mean increase for the 75 subjects 
originally randomized to placebo (19.6 ng/dL).  Among all subjects who enrolled into the open-label extension, a mean increase in testosterone was observed at Week 12 (original treatment groups analyzed as one), but testosterone declined compared with baseline at Week [ADDRESS_706304], on 
spermatogenesis, 25% of male subjects experienced a ≥ 50% decrease in sperm count, yet 
their counts remained within the normal range after [ADDRESS_706305] on sperm count; however, a decrease in plasma inhibin B and an increase in plasma FSH not associated with a change in testosterone were observed.

spermatogenesis and testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.  Prior studies in this population have not evaluated the effect of Atrasentan on spermatogenesis and testicular function.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Atrasentan is a highly potent and selective endothelin-A (ET
A) receptor antagonist being 
developed for the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy.  This study will provide 
safety information of Atrasentan administration for 26 weeks on spermatogenesis and testicular function.
Atrasentan has been evaluated in 5 studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy:  
one Phase 2a study in subjects with type 1 diabetic nephropathy who were not receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) inhibitors (Study M96-499), one Phase 2a study in subjects with type 2 diabetic nephropathy who were receiving stable doses of RAS inhibitors (Study M10-815) and three Phase 2b studies (Studies M11-350, M12-830, and M12-812) in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy who were receiving MTLDD of RAS inhibitors.
All studies showed that Atrasentan effectively reduced urinary albumin excretion with 
minimal fluid retention for up to 12 weeks of treatment.
The primary toxicities of Atrasentan in animals are effects on the reproductive system of 
both males and females and teratogenic effects on the fetus.  The effects of Atrasentan on male fertility are similar to those seen with other drugs in this class; seminiferous tubule atrophy as well as reduced male fertility are considered to be class effects of ET antagonists.  Effects observed in animals with Atrasentan are similar to those reported 
Atrasentan

for the –entans bosentan and ambrisentan.  As indicated above, testicular toxicity leading 
to impaired male fertility is a common feature of this class.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 2, prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study designed to evaluate the effect of Atrasentan on spermatogenesis and testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.  Approximately 20 subjects (to complete 15 evaluable subjects) with diabetic nephropathy who are taking RAS inhibitors are planned to be enrolled in the study at approximately [ADDRESS_706310] qualifies.  General laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) will be collected for safety monitoring and semen samples will be collected throughout the subject's study participation.
If at any time during the Treatment Period or at the T6/End of Treatment (EOT) 
(Week 26) visit the subject's sperm concentration drops below 15 million/mL, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and enter into an Observational Period of up to an additional 52 weeks.  If at the end of the 26-week Treatment Period there is a ≥ 50% 
reduction in sperm concentration from baseline the subject will also enter into the Observational Period.  
During the Observational Period, laboratory tests and semen samples will be collected. 
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706311] from the Investigator (or designee) [ADDRESS_706312] up to 4 weeks.  Procedures to be performed during the 
Screening Period are outlined in the Study Activities Table ( Table 1 ).  Subjects will be 
given supplies and instructions for obtaining the first morning void urine sample and scheduled to return to the site within the 4-week Screening Period to return the first morning void urine sample.  In addition, the subject will provide the semen samples according to the specific windows for semen collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) within the 
4-week Screening Period.  Tests for eligibility may be repeated within the subject's 4-week Screening Period.  Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria will be allowed to re-screen at the investigator's discretion.
Treatment Period
Eligible subjects will return for the T1 visit (Day 1) no more than 4 weeks from the initial 
screening visit.  The procedures to be performed at the T1 visit are outlined in the Study Activities Table ( Table 1 ), including initial administration of open-label study drug 
(Atrasentan).
The Treatment Period consists of five additional site visits over a 26 week period.
●The T2 (Week 2) visit will take place 2 weeks (± 7 days) after the T1 visit.
●The T3 (Week 4) visit will take place 2 weeks (± 7 days) after the T2 visit.
●The T4 (Week 6) visit will take place 2 weeks (± 7 days) after the T3 visit.  
●The T5 (Week 13) visit will take place 7 weeks (± 7 days) after the T4 visit.  
At this visit, subjects will be provided with supplies and instructions for the 
collection of the duplicate semen samples and will be scheduled for the collection of the semen samples according to the specific windows for semen 
collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Supplies and instructions for obtaining the 
first morning void urine sample within 1 day of the T6 visit will also be given 
to the subjects.  The site will also call into IVRS/IWRS at this visit and 
dispense study drug to the subject.

If the average of the two semen samples is < 15 million/mL, the subject will 
discontinue from study drug and return to the End of Treatment Visit (EOT) 
5 days (± 3 days) of the last dose of study drug.  For this subject, semen samples will not be collected at the EOT visit.
The T6/EOT (Week 26) visit will take place 13 weeks (± 7 days) after the 
T5 visit.  Subjects will be provided with supplies and instructions for the collection of the duplicate semen samples, and will be scheduled for the 
collection of the semen samples according to the specific windows for semen 
collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  If the average of the two semen samples is 
< 15 million/mL or there is a ≥ 50% reduction in sperm concentration from 
Screening at T6/EOT (Week 26) visit, the subject will enter the Observational Period.
The procedures to be performed at each visit are outlined in the Study Activities Table 
(Table 1 ).

with the remaining visits (O3 [Week 39] and O4 /End of Study [EOS; 
Week 52]) following every 13 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter.
The procedures to be performed at these visits are outlined in the Study Activities Table 
(Table 1 ). 
During the Observational Period duplicate semen samples will be collected until the subject's sperm concentration returns to within 15% of baseline or above, or until the end of the Observational Period.  At each visit, subjects will be provided with supplies and instructions for the collection of the semen samples, and will be scheduled for the collection of the semen samples according to the specific windows for semen collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  If at any time during the Observational Period the sperm concentration 
returns to within 15% of baseline or above, subjects will have completed their participation in the Observational Period.  The visit at which their sperm concentration returned to within 15% of baseline or above will be considered their End of Study visit.  These subjects will also be contact[CONTACT_105564] (or designee) within [ADDRESS_706317] (IRB)/Independent Ethics (IEC), after the nature of

and frequency. 
The [COMPANY_013] study designated physician (listed in Section 6.5) should be contact[CONTACT_135697](ies).
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior Therapy
Subjects currently using alpha blockers should have been on a stable dose for at least 
[ADDRESS_706329] be on a stable dose during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Therapy
If medically necessary, changes to or interruption of ACEi or ARB doses during the 
Treatment or Observational Periods of the study will be allowed.  Plasma levels of Atrasentan may be affected by [CONTACT_541527]3A or OATP inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, gemfibrozil, ciclosporin).  Potent P-gp inhibitors may potentially increase the plasma exposure of Atrasentan.  In addition, plasma levels of sensitive P-gp substrates (e.g., dabigatran) may be affected by [CONTACT_541528].  Caution should be used in patients taking any of these medications during the trial.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Therapy
Subjects should not enter into the study if they are currently receiving or have received 
testosterone or hormone replacement therapy within [ADDRESS_706330] 2016-000722-19

Treatment with hormone suppressive agents, including androgens, estrogens, anabolic 
steroids, glucocorticoids, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, or cancer chemotherapy during the study is prohibited.
Combinations of ACEi/ARB medications and/or concomitant use of aldosterone blockers 
or aliskiren are not allowed.
Use of hot tub/Jacuzzi/sauna are prohibited during the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidance for Managing Edema or Weight Gain
Weight will be measured at each visit during the Treatment Period of the study, preferably 
using the same device and under the same circumstances (i.e., same time of the day, no shoes or coats during measurement).  Results will be compared with the previous visit.  If there is an increase of ≥ 2 kg during the Treatment Period, it is recommended to 
implement the following activities:
●Rule out measurement errors or obvious reasons for the increase (i.e., diet 
transgression, different clothing than previously).
Evaluate for the presence of edema.  This may be indicative of fluid retention as the cause 
for weight gain.
Ascertain whether the subject has exceeded the recommended daily dietary salt intake 
(≤5 grams of sodium chloride).
If the subject is receiving a diuretic and has edema, increase the dose of the diuretic as necessary.  Re-assess the subject's tolerability within [ADDRESS_706331] is not receiving a diuretic, it is suggested to start a diuretic according to 
eGFR stratum and titrate the dose according to the response to the initial dose (see below):

< 15 × 106/mL during the 26-week Treatment Period.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Safety Variables
●The proportion of subjects who enter the Observational Period and do not 
return to within 15% of baseline or above during the 52-week Observational 
Period.   
●Change from baseline to each visit in sperm concentration.
●Change from baseline to each visit in each of the components of the semen analysis (sperm motility, sperm morphology, sperm count, semen volume).
●Change from baseline to each visit in serum testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, 
and inhibin B.
Safety data will be analyzed for the data collected throughout Treatment Period and up to 
[ADDRESS_706362]-treatment.  The following safety endpoints will be collected:
●The incidence of adverse events and the proportion of subjects who are 
discontinued from the study due to adverse events.
●The change from baseline to each visit in chemistry, hematology, and urine measurements.
●The change from baseline to each visit in vital signs.
5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Plasma concentrations of Atrasentan and its possible metabolites will be obtained at the 
times indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Population pharmacokinetic modeling techniques may 
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706363] 2016-000722-19
52
be used to estimate population central values for apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and 
volume of distribution (V/F) and conditional estimate values of these parameters for the individual subjects may also be determined.
Additional pharmacokinetic variables may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of 
the data.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Subjects will be discontinued from study drug immediately if any of the following events 
occur:
●Clinically significant deterioration of the subject's medical status that is 
thought to possibly or probably be related to study drug by [CONTACT_737].
●The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
●Investigator request (for any reason).
●Achievement of the primary study endpoint (sperm concentration 
<1 5×1 0
6/mL).
●Chronic dialysis or renal transplant.
●Subject is lost to follow-up.
If the subject is permanently discontinued from study drug and does not meet the criteria 
to enter the Observational Period, the procedures outlined for the T6/End of Treatment visit must be completed 5 days (± 3 days) of the last dose of study drug.  Additionally, the subject will be contact[CONTACT_108866] (or designee) approximately [ADDRESS_706364] will permanently discontinue from study drug and the procedures outlined for the T6/End of Treatment visit should be completed 5 days (± 3 days) of the last dose of study drug.

53
continue to be monitored during the Observational Period until sperm concentration 
returns to within 15% of baseline or above, or through the O4/EOS visit, whichever occurs first unless the subject withdraws consent.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period for other reasons than 
achievement of the primary study endpoint, will not be replaced unless the discontinuation rate exceeds 25% in the Treatment Period.  Subjects may be added to ensure that [ADDRESS_706366] is permanently discontinued from the Observational Period for other reasons 
than returning to within 15% of their baseline sperm concentration or above, the procedures outlined for the O4/End of Study visit must be completed 5 days (± 3 days) of the discontinuation.  
The date and reason for premature discontinuation in either period will be recorded in the 
subject's source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.   
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The Investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to [COMPANY_013] in advance of the intended termination.

Subjects who have underlying diseases/conditions and/or on medications affecting spermatogenesis or testicular function, history of allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to atrasentan or drugs similar to the study drug will be excluded to avoid confounding factors related to the effects being studied.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose of 0.75 mg was selected following analysis of the results of the Phase 2b trials.  
The rationale for selecting a single dose of Atrasentan is based on the narrow therapeutic index of this drug and the need to balance the efficacy in reducing albuminuria with the safety and blood pressure change parameters.  Subjects that enroll in the study will receive 0.75 mg QD of Atrasentan for up to 26 weeks during theTreatment Period. 
Dose selection for the Phase 2b studies was based on the exposure-response analyses and 
clinical results from Study M10-815.  Statistically significant exposure-response relationships for both the efficacy (UACR reduction) and the incidence of edema were 
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706374] 2016-000722-19
58
then quantified from all Phase 2 studies.  The simulations showed that a proportion of 
subjects achieving a 40% reduction in UACR increase with increasing dose from 0.25 mg per day approximately reaching a nadir in the range of 0.75 to 1.25 mg per day dose.  The simulations, however, also showed that the probability of edema increases with increasing atrasentan exposure with predicted incidences of 32% and 38% at a dose of 1.[ADDRESS_706375] any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706376] 2016-000722-19
59
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_706377]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706378] 2016-000722-19
60
Persistent or 
Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an 
important medical event.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's 
usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706379] 2016-000722-19
61
6.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_26278].

8.[ADDRESS_706385] of Atrasentan (0.75 mg QD) on spermatogenesis and testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.
There are no planned efficacy objectives for this study.  The primary safety endpoint is 
the proportion of subjects who have a sperm concentration < 15 × 10
6/mL by 26 weeks.  
Approximately 20 subjects (to complete 15 evaluable subjects) with diabetic nephropathy who are taking RAS inhibitors are planned to be enrolled in the study at approximately 20 sites.  Subjects will receive 0.75 mg QD of Atrasentan during the 26-week Treatment Period.
In the Treatment Period, semen samples will be collected at Screening (baseline), T5 
(Week 13) and T6/EOT (Week 26).  Semen samples will be collected at [ADDRESS_706386] 2016-000722-19

collection period.  In the Observational Period, semen samples will be collected according 
to the specific windows for semen collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), starting at the O1 
(Week 13) visit and then every 13 weeks thereafter until the sperm concentration has returned to within 15% of baseline or above, or until the end of the 52-week Observational Period, whichever occurs earlier.
General Considerations
Treatment effects will be evaluated based on a 2-sided 80% exact confidence interval.
Unless otherwise specified, for Treatment Period, the baseline observation is defined as 
the last non-missing measurement collected on or before the date of the first dose of study drug.  The final observations are defined as the last non-missing observations taken between the first dose and no more than [ADDRESS_706387] dose of study drug.
Unless noted otherwise, all analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.2 or higher 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC  [ZIP_CODE]) under the UNIX operating system.
8.1.[ADDRESS_706388] will be considered evaluable if the following is satisfied:  (1) the Overall Study 
Drug compliance status is ≥ 70%; and (2) completes the 26-week treatment period and has 
all planned sperm samples collected; or has sperm concentration value less than 15 million/mL observed by [CONTACT_541540].
The Safety Analysis Set includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  
Unless otherwise specified, the safety analysis set will serve as the primary population for the safety analysis in this study.
Atrasentan
M12-[ADDRESS_706389] disposition, completion of study, or discontinuation from the study, will be summarized.  The number and percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study will be summarized for the primary reason as well as for all reasons collected.
Concomitant medications reported by [CONTACT_541541] (WHO) dictionary will be summarized.  For each concomitant medication, the number and percentage of subjects who take this medication will also be summarized.
8.1.[ADDRESS_706390] 70% compliance with study drug at each visit during the Treatment Period will be summarized.  TheOverall Study Drug compliance for a subject (Yes or No) is defined as following:  if the subject has at least 70% compliance with study drug at the end of the Treatment Period, then this subject is considered to be overall compliant to study drug; otherwise, the Overall compliant status will be set to as No.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Safety Analyses
The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of subjects who have a sperm concentration 
< 15 × 10
6/mL during the 26-week Treatment Period.  The simple percentage of subjects 
and a 2-sided 80% exact confidence interval will be calculated.  The primary safety analysis will be conducted on the evaluable set.  When [ADDRESS_706391] a sperm concentration < 15 × 10
6/mL, the trial will 
claim that Atrasentan has a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint.

Protocol Title:   A Single-Country, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of the Effects of Atrasentan on 
Spermatogenesis and Testicular Function
Objectives:  The study objective is to evaluate the effect of Atrasentan on spermatogenesis and 
testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 10 sites.
Study Population:   Subjects that have diabetic nephropathy as defined by [CONTACT_541550].
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 
15 evaluable subjects.
Methodology:
This is a prospective, single-country, multicenter, single-arm study.  Eligible subjects will be treated 
with Atrasentan 0.75 mg once daily (QD) for 26 weeks.  Semen samples will be collected at Screening (baseline), Week 6, Week 13, and Week 26/End of Treatment (EOT) visit.  Duplicate samples will be collected at each time-point over a 7-day period with each sample being separated by [CONTACT_2669] 2 days.  The average of the 2 samples will be used as the value for that time-point.  Subjects will be discontinued from study drug and enter into an Observational Period of up to an additional 52 weeks if sperm concentration drops below 15 million/mL at any time during the Treatment Period or at the Week 26/EOT visit.  If at the end of the 26-Week Treatment Period, there was a ≥ 50% reduction in 
sperm concentration from baseline the subject will also enter into the Observational Period.  During the Observational Period, semen samples will be collected at Weeks 6 and 13 and then every 13 weeks until 
sperm concentration returns to baseline (± 15%) or until the end of the Observational Period.

Criteria for Evaluation:
Primary Safety Endpoint:
The proportion of subjects who have a sperm concentration < 15 × 106/mL by 26 weeks.
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):Secondary Safety Measures up to the End of Study:1. The proportion of subjects who enter the Observation Period and do not return to within 15% of 
baseline by 52 weeks after treatment discontinuation.  
2. Change from baseline to each visit in sperm concentration.
3. Change from baseline to each visit in each of the components of the semen analysis (sperm 
motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, semen volume).
4. Change from baseline to each visit in serum testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH, and inhibin B.
Pharmacokinetic:Atrasentan apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F) may be estimated using 
population pharmacokinetic techniques.
Statistical Methods:
Sample Size Justification:
The proportion of subjects with sperm concentration < 15 million/mL in an unscreened population of 
healthy male subjects is reported to be approximately 10% (Cooper et al 2010).  With [ADDRESS_706428] approximately 80% power to detect a 20% difference between the incidence rates in the Atrasentan group and the null hypothesis of 10% at 2-sided significance level 
of 0.2.
Safety:Primary Safety Endpoint :  The proportion of subjects who have a sperm concentration 
< 15 million /mL by [ADDRESS_706429] will be considered evaluable for the primary analysis if the following is satisfied:  (1) The Overall Study Drug compliance status = YES; and (2) Completes the 26-week TP and has all planned sperm samples collected; or has a sperm concentration value less than 15 million/mL observed prior to the end of treatment period.  The simple percentage of subjects and a 2-sided 80% exact confidence interval will be calculated.  Thus, when [ADDRESS_706430] a sperm concentration < 15 million/mL, the trial will claim that Atrasentan has a statistically 
significant effect on the primary endpoint.
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects who report treatment-emergent adverse events in treatment period will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term by [CONTACT_1570].  The number and percentage of subjects who report protocol-related adverse events in 
Observational Period will be also be summarized.
For each laboratory test, the mean change from baseline to the minimum, maximum, and to each visit 
will be summarized.  Additionally for selected laboratory tests of particular interests, the number and percentage of subjects whose laboratory value has shifted from normal at baseline to abnormally high or low at final will be tabulated.  The mean change from baseline to each visit in vital signs, including 
weight, will be summarized.

Name [CONTACT_26323]:   Atrasentan Phase of Development:  2
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   Atrasentan Date of Protocol Synopsis:   08 April 2016
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of the Effects of Atrasentan on Spermatogenesis and 
Testicular Function
Objectives:  The study objective is to evaluate the effect of Atrasentan on spermatogenesis and 
testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 20 sites.
Study Population:   Subjects with type 1 or 2 diabetes and nephropathy (e-GFR ≥ 35 ml/min/1.73 m2
and a urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g creatinine and < 5,000 mg/g 
(≥3.4 mg/mmol and < 565 mg/mmol)).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled to complete 
15 evaluable subjects.
Methodology:
This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study.  Eligible subjects will be treated with 
Atrasentan 0.75 mg once daily (QD) for 26 weeks while remaining on their RAS inhibitors.  Semen samples will be collected at Screening (baseline), Week 13 and Week 26/End of Treatment (EOT) visits.  Semen samples will be collected at two time-points over a 7-day period with each sample being separated by [CONTACT_2669] 2 days (48 hours) for each scheduled collection period.  The average of the 2 semen samples will be used as the value for that collection period.  If at any time during the Treatment Period or at the Week 26/EOT visit, the subjects' sperm concentration drops below 15 million/mL, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and enter into an Observational Period of up to an additional 52 weeks.  If at the end of the 26-Week Treatment Period, there is a ≥ 50% reduction in sperm 
concentration from baseline, the subject will enter into the Observational Period.  During the Observational Period semen samples will be collected (at two time-points over a 7-day period with each sample being separated by [CONTACT_2669] 2 days [48 hours]) every [ADDRESS_706433]'s sperm concentration returns to within 15% of baseline or above, or until the end of the Observational Period.  Subjects who do not meet the criteria to enter the Observational Period will have a follow-up contact [CONTACT_541521] (or designee) [ADDRESS_706434] dose of study drug.  Subjects, whose sperm concentration returns to within 15% of baseline or above during the Observational Period, will have a follow-up contact [CONTACT_541521] (or designee) within 14 days of the collection of the 
second semen sample.

rates in the Atrasentan group and the null hypothesis of 10% at 2-sided significance level of 0.2.
Safety:
Primary Safety Analysis:   
The primary safety analysis will be conducted on the evaluable set for the primary safety endpoint.  The 
simple percentage of subjects and a 2-sided 80% exact confidence interval will be calculated.  When [ADDRESS_706439] a sperm concentration < 15 × 10
6/mL, the 
trial will claim that Atrasentan has a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint.
Secondary Safety Analysis: 
The secondary analysis on the proportion of subjects who enter the Observational Period and do not 
return to within 15% of baseline or above during the 52-week Observational Period will be performed on the evaluable set.  The other secondary safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety population.  For proportion endpoints, the simple percentage of subjects and a 2-sided exact 80% confidence interval will 
be calculated.

Adverse Events (AEs) Analysis:
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Treatment-
emergent AEs (i.e., AEs that begin or worsen in severity after initiation of study drug) throughout the [ADDRESS_706441] dose of the study drug will be summarized in descending order by [CONTACT_6213], as well as by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and MedDRA preferred term.  The incidence rates of treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized.  Additionally, the treatment-emergent AEs will 
also be summarized by [CONTACT_541523].
The adverse events reported as reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.  Serious adverse events 
will be evaluated in a similar manner.
For the Observational Period, the protocol related AEs will be summarized similarly from [ADDRESS_706442] dose of study drug through study completion.  The number and percentage of subjects who report 
protocol-related adverse events in the Observational Period will also be summarized.
Laboratory Data:For each laboratory test, the mean change from baseline to the minimum, maximum, and to each visit 
will be summarized.  Additionally for selected laboratory tests of particular interests, the number and percentage of subjects whose laboratory value has shifted from normal at baseline to abnormally high or low at final will be tabulated.  The mean change from baseline to each visit in vital signs, including 
weight, will be summarized.
Interim Analysis:
An interim analysis will be performed after all the subjects have completed or prematurely discontinued 
from the 26-week Treatment Period.  The database will be formally locked and versioned.  The primary, applicable secondary and other safety analyses will be performed on this version of the clinical database.  There is no need to adjust significance level since the only comparison is in the primary analysis which 
will be conducted using data from the 26-week Treatment Period.

This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-country, single-arm study designed to demonstrate 
the effect of Atrasentan on spermatogenesis and testicular function in men with diabetic nephropathy.  Approximately 20 subjects (to complete 15 evaluable subjects) with diabetic nephropathy who are taking RAS inhibitors are planned to be enrolled in the study at approximately 15 sites.  Subjects will receive 0.75 mg once daily (QD) of Atrasentan for 26 weeks.  The duration of the study will be up to approximately 80 weeks.  Semen samples will be collected at Screening (baseline), Week 6, Week 13, and Week 26/End of Treatment (EOT).  A duplicate sample will be collected at each time-point over a 7-day period with each sample being separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_706459] 2 days but not more than 7 days prior to semen sample collection.  The average of the 2 semen samples will be used as the value for that time-point.  Subjects will be discontinued from study drug and enter into an Observational Period of up to an additional 52 weeks if sperm concentration drops below 15 million/mL at any time during the Treatment Period or at the Week 26/EOT visit.  If at the end of the 26-Week Treatment Period there is a ≥ 50% reduction in sperm

In addition, the subject will provide the semen samples according to the specific windows for semen collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) within the 
4-week Screening Period.  Tests for eligibility may be repeated within the subject's 4-week Screening Period.  Subjects who fail to meet eligibility criteria will be allowed to re-screen at the investigator's discretion.
Treatment Period
Eligible subjects will return for the T1 visit (Day 1) no more than 4 weeks from the initial 
screening visit.  The procedures to be performed at the T1 visit are outlined in the Study Activities Table ( Table 1 ), including initial administration of open-label study drug 
(Atrasentan).
The Treatment Period consists of five additional site visits over a 26 week period.
●The T2 (Week 2) visit will take place 2 weeks (± 7 days) after the T1 visit.
●The T3 (Week 4) visit will take place 2 weeks (± 7 days) after the T2 visit.
●The T4 (Week 6) visit will take place 2 weeks (± 7 days) after the T3 visit.  
●The T5 (Week 13) visit will take place 7 weeks (± 7 days) after the T4 visit.  
At this visit, subjects will be provided with supplies and instructions for the 
collection of the duplicate semen samples and will be scheduled for the collection of the semen samples according to the specific windows for semen 
collection (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Supplies and instructions for obtaining the 
first morning void urine sample within 1 day of the T6 visit will also be given

If medically necessary, interruption of ACEi or ARB doses during the Treatment or 
Observational Periods of the study will be allowed.  When returning to RASi therapy, the subject should return to the previous regimen of ACEi or ARB therapy that was prescribed prior to the interruption, although it will not be a requirement.  Conversions from one product to another (e.g., ACEi to ARB) must be at equivalent doses.  Combinations of ACEi/ARB medications and/or concomitant use of aldosterone blockers or aliskiren are not allowed.
Plasma levels of Atrasentan may be affected by [CONTACT_541527]3A or OATP 
inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, gemfibrozil, ciclosporin).  Potent P-gp inhibitors may potentially increase the plasma exposure of Atrasentan.  In addition, plasma levels of sensitive P-gp substrates (e.g., dabigatran) may be affected by [CONTACT_541528].  Caution should be used in patients taking any of these medications during the trial.

Subjects who have underlying diseases/conditions and/or on medications affecting spermatogenesis or testicular function, history of allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to atrasentan or drugs similar to the study drug will be excluded to avoid confounding factors related to the effects being studied.
Section 5.6.4  Selection of Doses in the Study
Add:  new first and second paragraph
The dose of 0.75 mg was selected following analysis of the results of the Phase 2b trials.  
The rationale for selecting a single dose of Atrasentan is based on the narrow therapeutic index of this drug and the need to balance the efficacy in reducing albuminuria with the safety and blood pressure change parameters.  Subjects that enroll in the study will receive 0.75 mg QD of Atrasentan for up to 26 weeks during theTreatment Period. 
Dose selection for the Phase 2b studies was based on the exposure-response analyses and 
clinical results from Study M10-815.  Statistically significant exposure-response relationships for both the efficacy (UACR reduction) and the incidence of edema were then quantified from all Phase 2 studies.  The simulations showed that a proportion of subjects achieving a 40% reduction in UACR increase with increasing dose from 0.25 mg per day approximately reaching a nadir in the range of 0.75 to 1.25 mg per day dose.  The simulations, however, also showed that the probability of edema increases with increasing atrasentan exposure with predicted incidences of 32% and 38% at a dose of 1.[ADDRESS_706554] paragraph previously read:

[ADDRESS_706581] Information and Consent
Add:  new second and third paragraph
Information regarding incentives for the subject and provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored samples will 
continue to be used for research and analysis.  In the event a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request their samples be withdrawn.  Once [COMPANY_013] receives this request, the remaining samples will be destroyed.  If the subject changes his consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.

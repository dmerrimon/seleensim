Page  2 of 23SECTION  I: RESEARCH  PLAN
1.Statement  of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  
Unpredictable swings  in post-meal blood glucoses are common for individuals with Type  1 Diabetes  (T1D). 
They have long been  instructed to bolus  rapid-acting insulin (RAI)  15 minutes  before meals to account for 
delays in insulin delivery time and onset of insulin action. The “Quick Bolus”  insulin  delivery feature has been 
introduced as a novel feature  of the new generation insulin pumps  with  a bolus  delivery rate 10 times faster 
than the conventional “Standard  Bolus”.  The impact  of this change  in bolus delivery rate, that can potentially 
change insulin  absorption and action leading to unexpected blood glucose  fluctuations, on RAI 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD)  has not been examined in individuals with T1D.
This study aims to address this gap in knowledge by [CONTACT_269053] 15 adults  (ages 18 – 30, inclusive)  with  T1D by a randomized  order, 
cross-over, single  blinded  insulin action  study. The PKPD properties of a 0.2unit/kilogram  RAI bolus  by 
“Standard Bolus”  and “Quick Bolus” will be compared for each subject using the euglycemic clamp technique 
during two admissions.  The 0.2unit/kg bolus  of RAI is standard for euglycemic  clamps and has been  employed 
many times in previous studies.  
We hypothesize that RAI absorption and action measured by [CONTACT_269054] “Quick Bolus” feature  as compared to the “Standard Bolus” eliminating the impractical need for an 
insulin bolus 15 minutes prior to meals  and consequently, lowering  the risk of hypoglycemia. Moreover, data 
derived from our study  will be essential  to model  insulin PKPD to customize insulin  delivery algorithms of 
future artificial pancreas systems  with  integrated “Quick Bolus” feature  to improve the treatment safety and 
efficacy for individuals  with T1D.
This study is not intended  to be submitted or held for FDA inspection, as it is not a device study,  but rather a 
study of the bolus  speed options available for individuals with Type  [ADDRESS_327253]  of insulin bolus 
speed on RAI PKPD has not been studied  by [CONTACT_269055] (Medtronic).  Of note, the now-defunct pump company Animas Corporation, previously  
offered similar  rapid  speeds on their commercially available  pumps, however there  are no published studies  
on the effect of bolus speed on insulin PKPD using  those older pumps that are no longer being manufactured.
2.Probable Duration  of Project: State the expected duration of the project,  including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
The study is expected to last 5 years.
3.Background: Describe  the background information  that led to the plan for this project.  Provide  references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
Investigators have  previously  demonstrated  that there  are a number of factors that alter insulin absorption 
and action following insulin boluses given by [CONTACT_269056], such as pump site duration (Swan et al., 2009) 
and temperature (Cengiz et al., 2014),  alterations that contribute to unpredictable  swings  in blood  glucose  
concentrations following meals. Thus, it is particularly  noteworthy  that the newest insulin pumps are 
equipped with a “Quick Bolus” option that delivers pre-meal  bolus doses ten times  faster than  the “Standard  
Bolus” option.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_269037], its effect on the pharmacokinetics  (PK) 
and pharmacodynamics (PD) of relatively  large  boluses  of rapid-acting insulin (RAI)  in comparison  to the 
Standard Bolus  have not been investigated in individuals with T1D on insulin-pump treatment.

Page  [ADDRESS_327254] of the faster  speed of bolus delivery (the “Quick Bolus”) on 
the absorption and action of RAI as compared to the conventional bolus delivery rate (the “Standard  Bolus”)  
in individuals with T1D and to determine  whether  alteration in speed of insulin delivery translates in to faster 
lowering of blood glucose concentrations after an insulin  bolus.
Specific Aims are to compare the PK and PD of the same dose of RAI when the dose  is delivered  by [CONTACT_941] “Quick  
Bolus” and by [CONTACT_941] “Standard Bolus” in individuals with T1D during two separate study visits using the 
euglycemic clamp technique. We hypothesize that the RAI absorption and action will be significantly faster, as 
defined by [CONTACT_269057]  25%, 50%  and maximum insulin levels and insulin action as compared  to 
RAI bolus  delivery by [CONTACT_941] “Standard  Bolus”. We also hypothesize that faster delivery of the insulin bolus will 
result in earlier clearance of exogenous insulin; i.e. faster  in and faster out.
The results  from this study have the potential to improve  the safety and efficacy  of daily  insulin  treatment by 
[CONTACT_269058].
The overall goal of insulin replacement in T1D is to mimic the function of beta cells to regulate blood glucose 
values during  everyday activities. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_269038]  (Garg, 2005), 
postprandial hyper-  and hypoglycemia are still common in those with T1D (Boland et al., 2001).  A major 
obstacle in optimizing after meal blood glucose has been  the delay  in insulin  absorption  and action after  an 
insulin bolus that results from the subcutaneous route of insulin delivery.  Previous studies have demonstrated 
that the peak plasma  insulin concentration (CIns  max) achieved after  a 0.2 U/kg bolus  dose of aspart insulin is 
not observed until 50 minutes after the dose  and the peak action is not observed  until 40 minutes later 
(GIRmax) in insulin pump treated patients when bolus is delivered at a rate of 1.5 units/min (Swan et al., 
2008). In addition, the speed of insulin  delivery has been described as “too slow”  by [CONTACT_269059]  
T1D anecdotally,  which is not surprising considering that the average insulin  bolus  delivery (0.2u/kg)  is 
expected to last 8 – [ADDRESS_327255] recent Medtronic insulin pumps 
(630G and 670G models) offer two bolus speed  options:  the “Standard Bolus” default setting  that delivers 1.5 
units of insulin per minute, which is the same bolus  speed  as the OmniPod and Tandem T-slim,  and also a 
“Quick Bolus” option that delivers [ADDRESS_327256]  of accelerated bolus  delivery on 
insulin PK and PD has not been investigated and could  lead to unexpected blood glucose fluctuations or even 
hypoglycemia if the insulin  bolus  is delivered  either 15 minutes prior to the meal or after finishing eating.  On 
the other hand, earlier insulin action could eliminate  the need for the impractical and cumbersome 15 minute  
pre-meal insulin bolus and it may limit the extent of hyperglycemia in patients  who take their meal boluses 
after eating.  Minimizing  extreme variability in blood glucose responses to meals has been  an important  goal 
to optimize  insulin treatment. Therefore, one of the main interests of Diabetes  research in general  has been 
to evaluate  and explore  factors that modulate  the exogenous insulin absorption and action in children and 
young adults with T1D.

insulin levels and a marked  blunting of early insulin action,  as shown  in the Figures below (Cengiz,

In 2014, a study investigating the effect on pump site warming using the InsuPatch  (IP) device on insulin  
absorption (Cengiz  et al., 2014)  was performed.  The  InsuPatch is warming device  used  in conjunction with an 
insulin pump to warm the infusion site to 40 degrees Centigrade to help improve insulin  absorption, as higher 
body temperature has been  previously shown to accelerate insulin  kinetics (Sindelka, Heinemann, Berger, 
Frenck, & Chantelau,  1994).  Results  of the InsuPatch study revealed that warming the infusion site resulted in 
earlier glucodynamic action, as reflected in the time to GIRmax and CIns max.   It is particularly  noteworthy 
that the accelerated rate of absorption with site warming in this study resulted in a time to GIRmax (TGIRmax) 
that was roughly 15 minutes earlier  than that observed without site warming, roughly the time we tell people 
to bolus before eating, as seen in Figure 3 below.

Page  5 of 234.Research Plan: Summarize the study  design and research  procedures  using non-technical language that can 
be readily understood  by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to distinguish between standard of care vs. 
research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits  specifying  their individual  times  and 
lengths.  Describe the setting in which the research will take place.
Study Design: This study will be a cross-over, randomized  order, single  blinded clinical study in subjects  with 
T1D, and will require two separate admissions per subject to the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96051] (one  
admission with use of the Quick  bolus option and one using the Standard  bolus option).  
Study Protocol: The protocol will consist of an outpatient enrollment visit to obtain consent and confirm 
eligibility and two admissions at either the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96051] (HRU) or Church Street Research Unit 
(CSRU). The procedures will be identical during both admissions, except for the speed of the insulin bolus 
delivery that will be used. 
Enrollment visit: At the enrollment visit, the risks and benefits of the study will be explained, the individuals  
will provide  written consent.  History and physical  examination will be performed, hemoglobin A1c will be 
measured by [CONTACT_269060]2000, hematocrit and serum potassium  will be measured and urine will be tested for 
pregnancy in female subjects of reproductive potential.  Subjects who are pregnant  will not be eligible from 
the study.   Pregnancy significantly changes  the way a body uses  glucose  and insulin,  which would be evident  
during the insulin clamp procedure.  For subjects who  are uncomfortable with  pregnancy  testing, we would 
not recommend they  participate in the study.   If all eligibility criteria are met, subjects  will be entered into the 
study. Randomization  with respect to the order of the studies  will also be performed  at the enrollment visit 
but subjects  will not be informed regarding the order  of randomization.  Of  note,  potassium and hematocrit 
will not be measured again during the course of the study,  as they  are used as screening to check for chronic 
causes of hypokalemia  and anemia.  A normal potassium level is important, as insulin drives potassium into 
the cells.  The insulin dose of 0.2u/kg used in the euglycemic clamp is a typi[INVESTIGATOR_269039] 
T1D often administer  at home for meals and is not considered excessive.  The amount of blood drawn  is 
about 40 mL, which is one-tenth  the amount typi[INVESTIGATOR_269040]  a healthy adult is donating  blood.
Preparation for the clamp:  Study subjects will check  blood glucose  at 5 o’clock in the morning and they will 
call or text the on-call investigator  for insulin  dose  adjustments  before they  come in for the insulin action 
study in order to begin  the euglycemic clamp as close to the target blood glucose  of 90 mg/dL  as possible. 
Subjects will be admitted fasting to the HRU  or CSRU the morning of each  clamp and all female  subjects  of 
childbearing potential will be given  another urine  pregnancy test.  A new subcutaneous infusion  set 
compatible with  the Medtronic 670G insulin pump will be inserted in the skin of the abdominal region before 
the clamp  study, as insulin pump wearers are familiar with from their daily diabetes routine. The Medtronic 
670G compatible  infusion sets we will use will be the commercially available Mio and Sure-T infusion sets.  
Subjects will discontinue using  their own  pump and will be switched to the study pump  programmed with  
their delivery settings  in order to accommodate bolus  speed delivery.  Study staff will inspect the reservoir 
retainer ring of the study  pump prior to each use in the study.  It is important  to note that, though the 
Medtronic 670G  insulin pump is part of the only hybrid-closed loop insulin delivery system commercially 
available, we will only be using the pump in this study, not the accompanying sensor and glucose  meter that

Page  6 of 23are used in conjunction with the insulin  pump.  The  subjects  will not be employing the hybrid  closed-loop  
system Study pump will be used in research unit only. Subjects will not take the study pump home.
Clamp (Insulin Time-Action)  Study Procedure: Two  intravenous catheters will be inserted,  one in each  arm 
prior to the start of the study. One of the catheters  will be used for variable rate infusion of dextrose during 
the study and the other will be used for frequent venous blood sampling  for measurements  of plasma glucose 
and insulin. After baseline  glucose  and insulin  samples  are obtained, the subjects  will be given  a 0.20 U/kg  
bolus of aspart  insulin via either Standard or Quick Bolus through  the insulin pump depending on the order of 
randomization. The insulin pump will be suspended after  the bolus and disconnected  from the study subject.      
Subjects will fast throughout the clamp procedure but will receive a variable rate of 20% dextrose solution to 
clamp the plasma glucose at the desired target (90+5 mg/dL) for [ADDRESS_327257] 90 minutes, then  every 15 minutes until 3 hours,  then every 30 minutes for 
the fourth and fifth hour.  After the conclusion of the clamp, subjects  will eat lunch and then be discharged 
from the HRU after receiving  follow-up instructions. Subjects will insert  their usual insulin  set prior to lunch.

This project will provide the first data on the differences in the time/action profiles  of bolus doses  of RAI 
when administered by [CONTACT_269061].  We have  chosen to 
restrict eligibility  for the study to young adults  with  T1D because most patients in this age group  require 
relatively large pre-meal  boluses of insulin, however in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_269041]  T1D generally 
give themselves at home.  Hence, these patients  with T1D are the group  who are likely to receive a benefit 
from the Quick Bolus  feature of new insulin pumps. Moreover, we don’t  anticipate  any problems with 
enrolling a sufficient  number  of subjects because we have many patients and in our practice who have  been 
actively engaged  in past studies. Insulin  aspart  was selected as the RAI to be used in the study  because we 
have a well-established assay for measuring plasma aspart levels and because the time/action  profiles of 
insulin aspart and insulin lispro (the two most commonly used insulins in insulin pumps) are virtually identical.

10.Risks: Describe the reasonably  foreseeable risks, including risks to subject  privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with  subjects  participating in the research. 
The primary  risks associated with the study  are hypoglycemia from the insulin bolus, and potential  discomfort 
and blood loss from the intravenous cannulation  and phlebotomy.
In November2019 the pump manufacturer issued a safety notice describing  a problem with a damaged 
reservoir retainer ring not locking the reservoir in place.  In Feb 2020  (FDA) classified  the November voluntary 
action as a Class  I recall. It is important to note that this classification did not introduce any new issues or 
generate new instructions. Please note  that a “recall”  as defined by [CONTACT_1622] “does not always mean that you 
stop using  the product or return it to the company.” If the pump reservoir properly locks in place  by [CONTACT_269062], the pump  may  continue  to be used.
11.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned  risks  will be minimized.
Hypoglycemia: The major risk associated with  this study is hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a common 
occurrence in individuals with T1D. It is estimated  that, in individuals  with well-controlled  T1D, at least 15% of 
all readings may be in the hypoglycemic range (Boland, et al., 2001). All subjects  will receive a standard  bolus

Page  9 of 23of insulin aspart of 0.2 U/kg during the glucose clamp  procedure.  It should  be noted,  however, that bolus 
doses of insulin of this magnitude are commonly  administered  by [CONTACT_269063]. In this case no meal  will be given. Rather, the blood sugar will be clamped  in the normal range at about 
90 mg/dL by a variable rate of exogenous glucose infusion. Venous  blood glucose  levels  will be checked every 
5 minutes for the duration  of the clamp procedure  by [CONTACT_269064],  available at the patient 
bedside and capable  of returning a value in 2 minutes. In previous studies, we determined that the maximum 
rate of fall of venous blood glucose following intravenous insulin is about 2 mg/dl/min (Tsalikian,  et al., 2003). 
We expect that with subcutaneous administration of insulin, the rate of fall will be far slower, and glucose 
readings every 5 minutes  will be more  than adequate  to monitor for and prevent any hypoglycemia. 
Infusion Site and Insulin  Pump:  The pump reservoir retaining ring will be inspected  to ensure  that the 
reservoir will lock in place.  The risks associated  with the infusion site insertion are all the same as the patient  
encounters during routine diabetes care at home:   bleeding, pain on insertion, and infection.  There  is also 
the risk of pump  site failure, indicated by [CONTACT_269065][INVESTIGATOR_269043].  If  a pump site failure is 
not addressed, within hours  an individual  with Type [ADDRESS_327261] the patient’s own  insulin  settings  programmed 
into the device.  The risk for any insulin pump is mechanical  failure,  which would be evident  with 
hyperglycemia, subsequent ketones, and possible diabetic ketoacidosis.  These  are risks that patients face 
with their own insulin pump and infusion  sets at home and they are mitigated  by [CONTACT_269066].
Phlebotomy: The major risks  associated with  intravenous cannulation and phlebotomy  are pain,  bruising, 
infection, inflammation, blood clot and blood loss. All intravenous lines will be inserted by [CONTACT_269067]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_269044], if requested, to 
minimize discomfort. The IV sites will be monitored during the course of the clamp procedure  for 
inflammation, swelling, or extravasation. The minimum  volume of blood required for the proposed studies is 
78.6 mL for the two clamp  studies: 
Clamp Study:
Insulin antibodies:  1.0 cc x 1 sample = 1.0 mL
Glucose: 0.3 cc x 61 samples = 18.3 mL
Insulin:  1.0 cc x 20 samples = 20.0 mL
Total Blood  Volume per admission = 39.3 mL
The maximum  blood volume  in the blood draws will not exceed 3 mL/kg  (considered  to be less than/equal to 
minimal risk).  This will be accomplished with  the use of three-way stopcock assemblies, so that "waste"  blood  
withdrawn to "clear  the line"  will be reinfused to the patient. We have previously demonstrated the feasibility 
of this procedure in patients with  diabetes (DirectNet 2003)  and can utilize blood volumes as low as 0.3 mL 
for the frequent glucose measurements. Using the 3mL/kg formula,  subjects  must weigh at least 37.9 kg in 
order to participate  in the study.

All adverse events will be carefully  monitored and documented using an adverse event form. The 
investigators will review the adverse event, determine its relationship to participation in the trial, and 
then grade  the severity of the event,  using  standard  definitions.  An adverse event is any adverse  change  
from the study  participant's  baseline condition  that occurs  following the screening  visit, through the end 
of the study period. All adverse events will be documented  in the study  records,  regardless of their 
relationship to the subject's participation  in the study. Adverse events will be documented as a medical

The primary  hypothesis in this protocol  is that the time to reach peak glucose  infusion  rate (TGIRmax),  will be 
significantly shorter when the Quick  bolus option is utilized  compared  to control conditions using a standard 
bolus option on the Medtronic 670G insulin pump. Using previous studies on mechanisms to affect insulin 
delivery speed (Cengiz,  et al. 2014), we have determined that a group size of [ADDRESS_327264] a 
difference with a two-sided  type 1 error  of 0.05  and a power of 80%, detecting a difference between means  
of roughly [ADDRESS_327265] as well as the period  by [CONTACT_269068] (1983).

2. Background Information: Provide  a description of previous  human use, known risks, and data addressing 
dosage(s), interval(s), route(s) of administration,  and any other factors that might influence risks. If this is the first 
time this drug is being  administered to humans, include relevant  data on animal models. 
The study will involve the use of insulin aspart which is FDA approved and  well-established  as a first-line therapy  
in CSII treatment of adults and youth with  T1D. The most common risk of insulin injection is hypoglycemia.  
However, it should be stressed that subjects will have blood  sugar levels  monitored  every 5 minutes for the 
duration of the clamp  procedure, and the dosage  of bolus  chosen for the study,  0.2 U/kg, is of a magnitude 
commonly administered by [CONTACT_269070][INVESTIGATOR_269048].  Blood  glucose levels  will also be 
monitored closely during the study and increased  IV Dextrose  given if the BG level falls below the targeted blood 
glucose of 90 mg/dL during that study.  The Medtronic  670G insulin pump  is FDA-approved for use in individuals 
with Type [ADDRESS_327268]-acting  insulin (aspart or lispro) per 
day.  For  this study, insulin aspart (Novo Nordisk) will be the allowed  medication. Vials of insulin aspart  will be 
provided by [CONTACT_093],  as will the Medtronic 670G  insulin pump. Dextrose is also used as part of the clamp  
procedure.

4.What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of  the identifiable 
study data  and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
Upon enrollment, all study subjects will be assigned a unique study number. The study number-and no personal  
identifiers-will be used as labels for study records and samples and any other related research documentation. 
Any study  obtained information that must be entered in the subject's medical  record will not contain the study 
subject ID number. A key linking the individual study numbers  to the study subjects will be kept by [CONTACT_269074] a separate computer from study information,  which  will be 
password protected and maintained in folder on a secure server.   All electronic  and digital  files will be stored 
on the secure  Yale network and the PC accessing the network will be password protected. Individual identifiable 
data or the key cited above will not be stored  on moveable media [e.g.  laptops, compact discs,  jump drives,  
thumb drives, personal digital assistants (PDA), Blackberry, etc.] unless encrypted. If identifiers are stored  on 
moveable media, then  investigators must use encryption methods to protect access to these  files or other 
methods as appropriate for the types  of information stored  on these devices.  Any research information 
intended for submission to the sponsor will be transcribed onto case report forms (CRF) and will contain no 
identifiers. All paper files will be stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked  office and access is limited to members 
of the study research team.
All portable devices  must contain encryption  software, per University Policy 5100.  If there  is a technical reason a 
device cannot  be encrypted  please submit an exception  request to the Information  Security,  Policy and Compliance 
Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]
5.What will be done with the data  when the research  is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_20913]. If no, describe how  the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured. All people who are involved in the conduct of this research study, including those 
involved in the study design, performance, data acquisition or analysis,  will be trained  on HIPAA regulations and 
will receive  human  subject protection training. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_269051]. In the case that 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_269052], s/he will make appropriate arrangements for the secured transfer of data.  
Research data will be stored  indefinitely following the completion  of the study.  
Research data  containing protected health  information  will be de-identified and archived in Yale approved 
archival storage.  When destroying paper records of research data with protected health information,  it will be 
shredded. All electronic media  will utilize methods for disposal such as zeroing or degaussing to remove 
personally identifiable research  data from electronic sources  as specified in "Disposal of Media Containing 
Confidential or Protected Health Information" under Procedure  1609: Media Controls  found at

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits  that may be reasonably expected to result  from  the research, either  to 
the subject(s) or to society  at large. (Payment  of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
There is no direct benefit to subjects participating in this study,  however, it is possible that the subjects in this 
study may benefit if the study  data reveal an effective  means to increase the rate of absorption  of subcutaneously 
administered rapid-acting insulins. Subjects  may receive pharmacokinetic and/or  pharmacodynamic information 
about insulin action that could improve their own diabetes care.
         SECTION  VI: RESEARCH  ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC  CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other  alternatives are available to the study subjects outside  of the research? 
The alternative to participating in this study is non-participation. Subjects who choose not to participate may 
continue their current  regimen of insulin  pump therapy,  as prescribed  by [CONTACT_269075].  There  are no risks of non-participation.
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments,  and the conditions for receiving  this compensation.
Screening and enrollment visit:   $30 
Clamp study visit:  $100; subjects will undergo  two clamps for a total of $[ADDRESS_327272] for completed  study:  $230, visits  will be paid as milestones using a Bank of 
America debit  card.
3.Costs  for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly  describe the subject’s costs  associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects.  
The inpatient  stay and all associated  study procedures will be provided at no cost to the subject.  The funding 
for the costs  of all study-related procedures, including the supplies and personnel for the clamp procedures,  
is pending. Costs of tests and supplies  that are part of usual  diabetes care, such as the A1c tests ordered as 
part of a regular health visit, will be covered  by [CONTACT_269076]. Patients will pay for 
gas, car mileage and parking or public  transportation fares.  Subjects  will be responsible for travel and may 
need to take off of work, as all visits take place on weekdays.  
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than  minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research that presents  the potential for physical harm (e.g.,  research involving blood draws).
a.Will medical  treatment  be available if research-related injury occurs? In the case of injury, 
medical care will be provided at the Yale-New  Haven  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. However, subjects  will be 
responsible for the costs of such medical care  that is not covered  by [CONTACT_269077].  
Additional compensation will not be provided in the case of injury. Subjects do not waive any of 
their legal rights by [CONTACT_269078].
b.Where and from whom may treatment  be obtained? Yale New Haven  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]
c.Are there any limits to the treatment  being  provided?  N/A

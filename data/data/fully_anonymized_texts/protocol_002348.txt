METHODOLOGY
This is a Phase 4, randomized, open- label, assessor -blind, parallel -group, multicenter 
non-inferiorit y trial with the option for superiorit y.  Approximately  [ADDRESS_935873] protocol at approximately  25-30 infertility  centers in the US w ill be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either MENOPUR® or Gonal -f®.  The primary  endpoint is ongoing 
pregnancy  rate.  
On the second or third day  of spontaneous menses, gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] (either MENOPUR® or Gonal -
f®) will be initiated at [ADDRESS_935874], based on follicular 
response assessed b y TVUS, dosing can be adjusted every day  as needed by  75 IU per adjustment.  
However, the maximum gonadotropin dose will be 300 IU/day ; gonadotropin dosing can continue 
for a maximum of 20 days.
Once the lead follicle measures ≥14 mm and /orserum E2levels are ≥300 pg/mL, the GnRH 
antagonist (ganirelix acetate) will be initiated at a daily  dose of 0.[ADDRESS_935875] start will be recorded in 
the e lectronic case report form.  A single injection of 250 μg hCG ( Ovidrel®) will be administered 
to induce final follicular maturation as soon as 3 follicles of ≥17 mm are observed on TVUS.  I n the 
case of excessive ovarian response (>30 follicles of ≥12 mm each and/or E2 levels ≥5000 pg/mL), 
the hCG trigger will be replaced wit h a GnRH agonist trigger (4 mg leuprolide acetate) and the 
fresh blastocyst transfer cancelled, with cry opreservation of all resultant viable blastocy sts
following biops y.  Oocy te retrieval will take place roughl y 36 hours after hCG administration, and 
oocytes will be inseminated by  [CONTACT_689923] (ICSI) 4±1 hours after retrieval; 
oocyte maturity  will be recorded.  Fertilization (number of pronuclei) will be checked on Day  1 
following oocy te retrieval.  Embry o qualit y will be assessed on D ays 3and 5following oocy te 
retrieval; in the case of late blastulation, assessments will be made on Day [ADDRESS_935876] quality  available will be transferred; all 
remaining blastocy sts wil l be frozen using the vitrification method.  Laser -assisted trophectoderm
biopsy  for preimplantation genetic screening will be done on expanded blastocy sts on Day  5

initiated, only  a single, 100 mg dose of ENDOMETRI N®will be given.  On subsequent 
days, ENDOMETRIN®will be administered 2 times daily , each delivering 100 mg of 
progesterone (200 mg/day).  ENDOMETRIN®will be initiated the evening of the day  after 
oocy te retrieval and will continue until the day  of the second -hCG test (if negative) or if 
pregnancy  is confirmed by  [CONTACT_33160] -hCG test for a maximum of 10 weeks total.
DURATION OF TREATMENT
Subjects are treated with IMPs (either HP -hMG or Gonal -f®) for a maximum of [ADDRESS_935879] 80% power, with 275 subjects per treatment group, to demonstrate the non -
inferiority  of MENOPUR® to Gonal -f®in the ongoing clinical pregnancy  rate at the 1-sided 
significance level of 0.025 with a 12% non- inferiority  margin, b y assuming an ongoing pregnancy  
rate of 50% for both treatment groups ( Yeh et al . 2014). Assuming that 8% of the subjects may  not 
be eligible for the per protocol analysis set, approximately  600 subjects will be randomized (1:1) 
into this study .
Efficacy:
The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate the non -inferiorit y of MENOPUR®versus
Gonal -
f®with respect to ongoing pregnancy  rate in women undergoing COS following a GnRH 
antagonist protocol .  The non -inferiorit y limit for the difference between t reatments ( MENOPUR®
minus Gonal -f®) will be -12% (absolute) .  The non -inferiorit y hypothesis to be tested for the 
primary  endpoint will be:
H0: MENOPUR -Gonal -
f-12% 
against the alternative 
H1: MENOPUR -Gonal -f> -12%, where
MENOPUR and Gonal -fdenote the ongoing pregnancy  rate of subjects treated with MENOPUR®and 
Gonal -f®, respectivel y, in a single fresh blastocyst transfer following a GnRH antagonist protocol.
The null hy pothesis (H 0) will be tested against the alternative by  [CONTACT_2164] a 2-sided 
95% confidence interval for the difference in ongoing pregnancy  rates.  Subjects who do not have at 
least 1 intrauterine pregnancy  with a detectable fetal heartbeat at 10- 11 weeks gestation (8-9weeks 
after blastocy sttransfer in the fresh cy cle), due to missing data, earl y withdrawal, or an y other 
reason will be considered treatment failures (i.e., not having ongoing pregnancy ).  If the lower -limit 
of the 95% confidence interval is greater than the non -inferiorit y limit ( -12%), the null hy pothesis 
will be rejected and it will be claimed that MENOPUR®is non -inferior to Gonal -f®with respect to 
ongoing pregnancy  rate.  The primary  efficacy  analy siswill be conducted for the modified intent-
to-treat population, defined as all randomized (as planned) subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
IMP.  If the lower bound of the confidence interval is above 0%, superiority will be declared.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The Menotrophin vs. Recombinant FSH in vitro Fertilization Trial (MERiT )study was a large, 
randomized, open -label, multicenter, multinational study  comparing treatment outcomes of 
controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) using MENOPUR®(n=363) with those using recombinant 
follicle -stimulating hormone (rFSH ) α (Gonal -f®, [COMPANY_006] KGaA, Darmstadt, [LOCATION_013] , n=368) in in 
vitro fertilization (I VF) cy cles using a long gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist down-
regulation protocol (Andersen, 2006). The results of this study  conducted in 2005 demonstrated 
non-inferiorit y of MENOPUR®to Gonal - f®in ongoing pregnancy  rates.  Meta -analy ses h ave 
indicated that menotropi[INVESTIGATOR_689913] l-f®in the long GnRH agonist
protocol (vanWelyetal.2011).  A randomized, open -label, assessor -blind, parallel -group ,
multicenter trial comparing the efficacy  of MENOPUR®and rFSH (P uregon®: Schering -Plough 
Organon) was condu cted in subjects undergoing COS following a GnRH antagonist protocol; this 
study , called MEGASET, randomized 749 subjects in Europe (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Poland, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey ) (Devroey , 2012 ).  The ongoi ng pregnancy  rates in the 
MENOPUR®and P uregon®groups were 28.9% and 26.7%, respectively , in the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population and 30.0% and 27.0%, respectively , in the per protocol (PP) population.  The non-
inferiority  of MENOPUR®to Puregon®, with re spect to the ongoing pregnancy  rate,was 
demonstrated for bo th the ITT and PP populations.
A retrospective anal ysis of data from both MERiT and MEGASET evaluated the impact of 
gonadotropin treatment on ovarian response and clinical outcome in women at risk of a high 
response and who were undergoing IVF/intracy toplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment (Arce, 
2014). Women at risk of a high response were defined as those with anti -Müllerian hormone 
(AMH) levels >75thpercentile (i.e., equivalent to >5.2 ng/mL [37.4 pmol/L ] in both studies), 
corresponding to 155 women in the 
MERiT study  and 188 women in the MEGASET study .  High 
ovarian response was defined as ≥15 oocy tes retrieved.  Treatment with MENOPUR®versus rFSH 
was associated wit h a lower median number of oocy tes retrieved in women at risk of a high 
response, irrespective of the down-regulation protocol ( Arce, 2014) .  When the data of women with 
high AMH from both protocols were integrated, MENOPUR®treatme nt was associated with a 
significantl y lower incidence of high response (32% versus 49%, p=0.001) and increased live birth 
rate per started cy cle (34% versus 22%, p=0.012) compared with rFSH treatment (Arce, 2014 ).
1.2 Scientific Justif ication for Conducting the Trial
The current study  has a similar design as the MEGASET study  conducted in Europe.  The aim of 
this study  is to demonstrate non- inferiorit y of MENOPUR®versus rFSHα (Gonal -f®) with respect 
to ongoing pregnancy  rate in potential high -responders undergoing IVF/ICSI  treatment, using an 
initial gonadotropin dose of [ADDRESS_935889]- controlled protocol.  Subjects will be 
classified as high ovarian responders based on a serum level of AMH ≥5ng/mL . The AMH

Figure 1 Trial Flow Diagram
3.1.2 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is a Phase 4, randomized, open- label, assessor -blind, paral lel-group, multicenter study  to be 
conducted at approximately  25-30 infertility  centers in the [LOCATION_002] ( US).  Approximately  [ADDRESS_935893] protocol will be randomiz ed to receive 
either 
MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®.  The stud y is designed to demonstrate non -inferiorit y of 
MENOPUR®versus Gonal -f®for ongoing pregnancy  rates in a predefined high -responder subject 
population.  High responders will be defined as subjects who have a serum AMH ≥5ng/mL .  All 
AMH measurement s will be determined at a single reference laboratory  (ReproSource, Inc., 
Woburn, MA), utilizing materials and reagents from Beckman Coulter -
DSL (Chaska, MN).
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to undergo COS with either MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®in a GnRH 
antagonist cy cle.  Gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115] (either MENOPUR®or Gonal -f®) will be started on the second or 
third day of spontaneous menses.  The gonadotropin dose will be initiated at [ADDRESS_935894], based on follicular response assessed by  [CONTACT_684107], dosing 
can be adjusted every  day as needed by  75 IU per adjustment.  However, the maximum 
gonadotropin dose will be 300 IU/day ; gonadotropin dosing can continue for a maximum of 
20days.  Coasting is prohibited.

hCG trigger to draw serum hCG, E2, and P4 levels.  If the hCG level is <50 IU/L  and/or P4 is 
<3.5 ng/mL, then a booster/rescue second dose of hCG must be given on that dayas soon as 
possible.  If the subject received the GnR H agonist trigger, the bl oods drawn will be LH, E2, and P4
levels.  If ,after the GnRH agonist trigger, the LH is <15 IU/L and/or the P4<3.5 ng/mL, a 
rescue/booster dose of hCG (Ovidrel®) should be given as soon as possible.  Delay  of oocy te 
retrieval wil l be left to the clinician’s discretion and will be based on the time at which the rescue 
dose was administered.
Oocy te retrieval will take place approximately 36 hours after hCG administration.  Oocy tes will be 
inseminated using partner sperm b y ICSI 4±1 hours after retrieval ; oocy te maturity will be 
recorded.  F ertilization (number of pronuclei) will be checked on Day  1 following oocy te retrieval.  
Embry o quality  will be assessed on Day s 3 and 5 following oocy te retrieval; in the case of late 
blastulation , assessments will be made on Day  [ADDRESS_935898] quality  available will be transferred; all remaining biopsied blastocy sts will be 
frozen using the vitrification method. Laser-assisted trophecto derm biops y for preimplantation 
genetic screening (P GS) will be done on Day 5; in the case of late blasulation, biopsy  will be 
performed on Day 6or Day  7, as needed. PGS results will not be used to select the blastocy st for 
fresh transfer.   No fresh tran sfers will be done on Day  6 or Day  7 blastocy sts.
The evening 
of the day  after oocy te retrieval, vaginal progesterone inserts (ENDOMETRIN®; 
Ferring) will be initiated for luteal phase support.  On the day  that the progesterone inserts are 
initiated, only  a single, 100 mg dose of ENDOMETRI N®will be given.  On subsequent day s, two

For subjects with no ongoing pregnancy  in the fresh cy cleor for those receiving agonist trigger, 
single frozen blastocy st transfer cy clescan be initiated within [ADDRESS_935902]’s initial date of 
randomization.  Single blastocy st transfer is mandatory .  The PGS results canbe used to select a
euploid blastocy st for frozen blastocy sttransfer.  Frozen- thawed blastocy st transfer cycle data will 
be collected, including blastocy st transfer information (to include embry o grade ,euploid status, 
endometrial thickness, presence of blood/mucus on transfer catheter tip, and whether blastocy st is 
retained in the catheter requiring a second pass), -hCG test results, clinical pregnancy , ongoing 
pregnancy , and live birth .
In women undergoing COS, an excessive response to follicular- stimulating agents may  lead to the 
development of OHSS, which represents a spectrum that can be categorized as mild, moderate, or 
severe . Subjects who have an excessive response to ovarian stimulation ( >30follicles that are ≥ 12 
mmeach and/or serum E2 ≥5000 pg/mL) will have the cy cle cancelled and converted to freez e all 
with GnRH agonist trigger.  That is, the subject will receive 4mg of leuprolide acetate administered 
subcutaneousl y at least [ADDRESS_935903]; TVUS -guided oocy te 
retrieval will be performed approximately  [ADDRESS_935904] and on the AE page in the eCRF.  Severe OHSS that requires medical or surgical 
intervention (i.e., paracentesis, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is considered a serious adverse event (SAE).  
See Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_935905]-trial follow- up extends to collection of delivery  information (live birth and neonatal health to 
include APGAR scores, birth weight, gestational age at birth, presence of congenital anomaly /birth 
defect , and cause of neonatal death, if applicable ), which will be collected for all subjects with an

The cy cle will be cancelled in case of poor ovarian response ( if the Investigator judges that 
≥3follicles of ≥17 mm cannot be reached after a minimum of 10 day s of stimulation) .  
Subjects who have an excessive response to ovarian stimulation (
>30follicles of ≥12 mm and/or E2 
≥5000 pg/mL ) will have the fresh transf er cancelled , and the hCG trigger will be replaced with a 
GnRH agonist trigger (4 mg l euprolide acetate). If leuprolide acetate is administered, a blood 
sample for LH will be collected and analy zed at the local lab. All resultant expanded blastocy sts 
will be vitrified after troph ectoderm biops y, with no fresh blastocy st transfer in order to decrease
therisk of OHSS.  Following oocy te retrieval and blastocy st evaluation ,an End of Trial ( EOT )
Visit will be scheduled or completed and the inf ormation will be documented in the eCRF .
In order to minimize the risk of empty  follicle sy ndrome, the subject will return the morning after 
hCG trigger to draw serum hCG, E2, and P4 levels.  If the hCG level is <50 IU/L  and/or P4 is 
<3.5 ng/mL, then a boo ster/rescue second dose of hCG must be given on that dayas soon as 
possible.  If the subject received the GnRH agonist trigger, the bl oods drawn will be LH, E2, and 
P4levels.  If ,after the GnRH agonist trigger, the LH is <15 IU/L and/or the P4 <3.5 ng/m L, a 
rescue/booster dose of hCG (Ovidrel®) should be given as soon as possible.  Delay  of oocy te 
retrieval will be left to the clinician’s discretion and will be based on the time at which the rescue 
dose was administered.
6.5 Visit 5 - Oocytes Retrieval/Insem ination
A TVUS will be performed and oocy tes retrieved roughl y 36 hours after hCG administration.  
Oocy tes will be inseminated using partner or donor sperm by  [CONTACT_322775] 4±1 hours after retrieval.
  
Oocy te maturity will be assessed at the time of ICSI.  Fertiliz ation (number of pronuclei) will be

is defined as creatinine >1.2 mg/ dL.  Oliguria is defined as urine output less than 500 mL/[ADDRESS_935954] and on the AEpage in the eCRF.  Severe OHSS that requires medical or surgical 
intervention (i.e., paracentesis or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is considered a nSAE (see Section 8.4).
Early OHSS is defined as OHSS with onset ≤9 days after triggering of final follicular maturation.  
Classification of grade is according to Golan’s classification sy stem (Golan, 1989) and all OHSS 
cases will be graded a s mild, moderate ,or severe.  Preventive interventions for early
 OHSS cover 
cycle cancellation due to excessive ovarian response, triggering of final follicular maturation with 
GnRH agonist ,and administration of dopamine agonist (the latter is onl y consid ered as preventive 
intervention in subjects with ≥20 follicles of ≥12 mm).
Late OHSS is defined as OHSS with onset >[ADDRESS_935955] visit.  Any  use of prior medication or concomitant medication will be recorded in the 
source documents and eCRF and include the following information:  name [CONTACT_2100], total

Each of the items in the AE L og is described in detail in the following sections.
Adverse Event
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available.  If not, separate signs and s ymptoms 
should be recorded.  One diagnosis/s ymptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AE more than on ce and the subject recovers in between the 
events, the AEs should be re corded separatel y.  If an AEchanges in intensity , a worst -case 
approach should be used when re cording the event, i.e ., the highest intensity  and the longest

death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, whic h is an 
AE).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or sy mptom(s) were first noted.  If the AE is an 
abnormal clinicall y significant laboratory  test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample wa s taken or the examination was performed.  
Intensity
The intensity  of an AE must be classified using the following 3-point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activit y (disturbing).
Severe: Inability  to work or perform usual activiti es (unacceptable).
                                                
aException: if an AE with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre- treatment AE) changes in 
intensity, thi s must be recorded as 2 separate events.  The initial AE should be recorded w ith outcome “not yet 
recovered” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed.  The second AE should be 
recorded w ith date and time of onset when the intensity ch anged.

Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship 
between the IMP and the AE.  The AE may  occur as part of the 
pharmacological action of the IMP or may  be unpredictable in its 
occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strongl y associated with IMP exposure.
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongl y suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal 
association or the event recurs on rechallenge.
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
Known consequences of the underl ying disease or condition under investigation.
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some 
frequency  during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.
Action Taken to IMP
The action taken to the IMP in response to an AE must be classified as 1 of the following:
No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken).
Withdrawn.
Interrupted.
Dose reduced.
Dose increased.
Other Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well- being of the subject.  Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency  situation.
If medication is administered to treat the AE, this medication should be entered in the Concomitant

The primary  objective of the trial is to demonstrate that MENOPUR®is non -inferior to recombinant 
FSH with respect to ongoing pregnancy  rate in a sin gle fresh treatment cy cle following a GnRH 
antagonist protocol .  Ongoing pregnancy isdefined as presence of at least 1 intrauterine pregnancy  
with a detectable fetal heartbeat at 10 -11 weeks gestation (8 -9weeks after blastocy sttransfer in the 
fresh cy cle).  The non -inferiority  limit for the difference between treatments ( MENOPUR®versus 
Gonal -
f®) is -12% (absolute). The non -inferiorit y hypothesis to be test ed for the primary  endpoint 
is:
H0: MENOPUR -Gonal -f®-12% 
against the alternative 
H1: MENOPUR -Gonal -f®> -12%,

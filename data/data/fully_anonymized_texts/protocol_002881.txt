1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1  Common Warts of Hand and Fingers  
Non -genital warts (verruca vulgaris) are an extremely common, benign, and usually a self -limited skin 
disease. Infection of epi[INVESTIGATOR_433190] (HPV) results in cell proliferation 
and a thickened, round, raised pa pule on the skin ranging in size from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_846289] 10 mm. The 
appearance of warts is determined by [CONTACT_846304]. There are 
several reasons why some individuals are affected by [CONTACT_433210], and other remain trouble free.  Th ese 
include: the type and strength of the viral strain, the health of the exposed person, and the strength 
of an individual’s immune response.  Any area of skin can be infected, but the most common sites 
are the hands and feet. Common warts are most often seen on the hands and present as skin -colored 
papules with a rough 'verrucous' surface.  
 
1.2 Current Care  
Current treatments for common warts involve destruction of the infected cells either chemically or 
physically and treatment depends on the size, loca tion, number, type, age of the patient, risk of 
scarring and patients’ commitment to the therapy.  The clinical management of these warts is 
challenging, and no current treatment is singularly effective, especially against warts that are 
recalcitrant. Thes e include non -surgical, pharmacologic , and surgical treatment modalities: topi[INVESTIGATOR_846290]; immune modulators using contact [CONTACT_846305][INVESTIGATOR_014]; intralesional 
candida antigen or bleomycin; cryotherapy; duct tape occlusion; photodynam ic treatment; pulsed 
dye laser; and general surgical procedures.  
 
1.3 Non-Surgical Approach  
Chemical Destruction:  
Salicylic Acid  
The use of salicylic acid is one of the two most commonly used treatments for warts. Dermatologists 
prescribe chemical destruction treatments where patients apply an over -the-counter preparation, 
usually less than 17% salicylic acid or prescription salicylic acid containing up to 70% salicylic acid at 
home every day.  Treatment response rates of 40 -84% with an ave rage of 61% have been reported 
as an effective therapy for non -genital cutaneous warts.[ADDRESS_1176571], with a cure rate of 75 
percent compared with 34 -48 percent in placebo controls.1,3 Other agents used  for chemical 
destruction are monochloracetic acid, dichloracetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, silver nitrate, glycolic 
acid and 80% phenol in solution.  Complications associated with using chemicals include pain, 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], burnin g sensation and erythema.4    
 
Cantharidin  
Cantharidin is used as an agent in the clinic by "painting" the wart causing oxidative stress by 
[CONTACT_433212] [ADDRESS_1176572] the dead wart.

Page 7 of 41  
Immune Modulators  
This treatment uses the patient’s own immune system to fight the warts.  Forms of immune 
modulators include imiquimod, intralesional immune modulators using Candida antigen or anti -
cancer such as Bleomycin; contact [CONTACT_179475], cimetidine, zinc, and retinoids. Because wart 
proliferation is controlled by [CONTACT_27639], va rious methods have been used to stimulate the 
immunologic response to HPV. This treatment is used when the warts remain despi[INVESTIGATOR_846291]. One type of immunotherapy 
involves applying a chemi cal diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). Among these are topi[INVESTIGATOR_846292], such as imiquimod and intralesional 
interferons5 to the warts. A mild allergic reaction occurs around the treated warts which stimulates 
the body’s innate response to fight the virus.  
 
Physical  Destruction  
Liquid Nitrogen Cryotherapy  
For common warts in adults and older children, cryotherapy is a standard treatment and can be done 
in the physician’s office.  Cryotherapy involves freezing a wart using a very cold substance (usually 
liquid nitrogen). The liquid nitrogen application usually takes less than a minute and most warts 
require [ADDRESS_1176573] up to 3 days. Healing is generally quick (7 to 14 days) with little or no scarring .[ADDRESS_1176574] may numb the wart with an anesthetic injection.   
 
1.4 Surgical Approach  
Electrosurgery and Curettage  
Electrosurgery (burning) is an available treatment f or common warts, filiform warts, and foot warts. 
Curettage involves scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_58448] (curetting) the wart with a sharp knife or small, spoon -shaped tool. 
These two procedures often are used together. The dermatologist may remove the wart by [CONTACT_433213][INVESTIGATOR_846293].  
 
Excision  
The wart may be cut off or surgically excised in combination to using other applications previously 
mentioned.  
 
1.5 Alternative Approach  
CellFX® System  
 
The CellFX System  is intended to clear the skin of benign, undesired skin lesions as an alternative to 
surgery and other more destructive methods for removing non-neoplastic benign lesions. The CellFX 
System  utilizes non -thermal, localized delivery of a timed series of low energy, nanosecond electrical 
pulses that can trigger regulated cell death.  The non -thermal effect on tissue takes place in a very 
shallow depth of skin directly below the sterile treatmen t tip. Histology of skin treated with CellFX 
has demonstrated selective non -thermal effects on  cellular structures, including melanocytes, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_73915] , and sebaceous glands, with no apparent damage to the adjacent acellular dermis.

The device deliver s less energy to tissue, but none of these emit thermal energy unlike laser, electro -
surgery, or electro -cautery equipment.  
 
PRIOR CLINICAL STUDIES SUMMARY  
Twelve (12) clinical studies have been or are currently being conducted using IRB approved non -
signi ficant risk protocols and consent with  the Nano -Pulse Stimulation  (NPS) device . A combined total 
of approximately 3,[ADDRESS_1176575] been reported and they were  resolved 
within days of the procedure.  
 
Previous Wart Studies Using CellFX System  
Nineteen  (19) adult subjects  were  enrolled with  the requirement of having a minimum of [ADDRESS_1176576] NPS session using a 5 -point size scale. At the end of the study, 
all subjects were asked ab out their satisfaction with each treated lesion clearance based on a 5 -point 
scale from 1 equaling highly dissatisfied and 5 being satisfied .7 
 
Six (6) of the nineteen subjects were male (32%) and 13 were female (68%). Subjects ranged in age 
from 23 to 71, with an average age of 47. Fitzpatrick skin types were distributed across Type I (5%), 
Type II (58%), and Type III (37%). Fifty -two percent (52%) of w arts were recalcitrant with 69% 
common warts located on the hands, fingers , and shoulders and the remaining 31% plantar warts. A 
total of [ADDRESS_1176577] -treatment. Fifty -one percent (51%) of treated wa rts (19/37) received 
two treatments and 65% (n=20 common and 4 plantar) showed greater than 50% reduction in size 
with 51% (n=19) rated completely clear at [ADDRESS_1176578] -treatment. Three (3)  out of 16  sham control 
warts (18.8%) showed 100% reduction in size , suggesting a possible immune response involved with 
use of NPS. There were no observations of hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_846294] [ADDRESS_1176579] -treatment were noted that resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 7 or Day 30. Based on 
these initial results of achieving a high rate of wart size reduction, inclusive of recalcitrant warts, and 
with a single NPS session, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_846295] .7

A total of 62 subjects and 267 study warts ( 195 treated and 62 sham controls) with an average of 4.[ADDRESS_1176582] treatment. Forty -two subjects 
were female (68%) and 20 were male (32%) with an average age of 47.3 . Fitzpatrick skin types were 
distributed across Type I ( 5%), Type II (4 4%), Type III ( 32%) and Type IV ( 19%). More than 70% of all 
treated warts were located on the hands, knee, ankle, arm, leg, neck, and torso while the remaining 
30% were plantar warts. Pre -treatment with intralesional injection of sodium bicarbonate buffered 
1-2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epi[INVESTIGATOR_846296] (mean, 1. 0ml). Subjects reported 
a median 4.0 at the time of trea tment based on a 11 -point visual pain scale, with 47.8% reporting a 
score of [ADDRESS_1176583] treatment showing  greater than 90% reduction in size was 
observed in 77.4% of common (72/93) and 43.8% of plantar warts (14/32). Single treatment efficacy 
at [ADDRESS_1176584] treatment showed 81% (51/63) in patients with common warts and 31.6% (6/19) 
with plantar warts. Subject satisfaction at the end of study was reported in 73.7% (98/133)  of 
subjects being satisfied with final res ults. As previously described in the wart feasibility study, there 
were 11 sham control warts ( 17.7%) showing  100% reduction in size. A total of 31 cases of transient 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (22. 8%); 61% mild, 35% moderate, 3% mod/severe and 8 observations of 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371] ( 5.9%) were observed at [ADDRESS_1176585] treatment . No serious adverse events 
were reported however , 9 treatment -related adverse events ( 6 mild  and 3 moderate severity) of 
transient pain , numbness , or infection  were report ed. These AEs occurred on the hands (n=5) or 
plantar area (n= 4) and all  were resolved  with  no associated sequela .[ADDRESS_1176586] application with liquid nitrogen

2.2 Proposed Indication for Use  
The Pulse Bioscience s’ CellFX System is investigational in the U.S. and the system is indicated for 
dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin including the treatment of 
common warts.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1176587] with a metal probe  (spray tip)  held a t liquid nitrogen temperature  until a 2 to 3 mm 
halo is visible around each wart .   All physicians are required to use the same Cryosurgical System.  
 
3.0 PROTOCOL  
3.1 Study Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the  safety and effecti veness of the CellFX System  
to Cryosurgery for the clearance of cutaneous non -genital  common warts on all areas of the body, 
excluding the scalp, nose , within the orbital region of the face , plantar or periungual area  in healthy 
adult subjects .  
The following objectives are to e valuate the overall response to CellFX and Cryosurgery : 
• Wart  response after treatment vs. the pre -treated appearance of the same lesion  
• Wart  response at various points in time over several weeks following the initial treatments  
vs. the same pre -treated wart  
• Overall w art clearance (generally accepted as complete clearance of warts from the 
treated area)  
• Comparisons of reduction from baseline in wart size of treated warts  
• Document the condition of skin in the treatment areas over the course of various time 
periods post -initial CellFX and Cryosurgery , and  
• Document all safety related issues that may be considered as adverse side effects or 
serious adverse events

Page [ADDRESS_1176590] -initial CellFX 
and Cryosurgical  treatments. At the 30 -day or 60-day follow -up visit, if any wart is classified as “not 
resolved” ,  the wart must receive an additional treatment. In case of a second or third retreatment, 
the subject will be evaluated by [CONTACT_846308] 30-days , 60-days , and [ADDRESS_1176591] -
retreatment. Photography of the warts will be captured along with the blinded site investigator 
assessments at all visits.  
 
Numbness  (diminished/altered sensation)  Assessment: The treating investigator will conduct a 
“light touch” exam to all treated areas at  baseline, [ADDRESS_1176592] retreatment(s).  Light touch is tested with a cotton wisp, feather, and/or even light finger 
touch.  The subject will be asked how one area feels compared to another.  
 
Note  1:  
Eligible warts that should be treated and do not receive a retreatment will be considered a protocol 
deviation. The reason(s) for not receiving an additional treatment will be collected on the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). These subjects will remain in the study and will be inclu ded in the ITT 
population.  
 
Additionally, subjects can only receive two additional treatment s or up to a maximum of three CellFX 
or Cryosurg ical procedures . 
 
Non -Treated Wart Criteria : Data will be collected on ineligible or non -treated warts for all enrolled 
subjects. Non -treated warts are defined as  flat, periungual, subungual, mosaic, plantar, filiform 
and/or  common warts that are excluded due to anatomic location. Photography of the  non-treated 
warts will be captured  at baseline  and the last study  visit.   
 
3.3 Randomization  
All enrolled subjects will be randomized  according to the total number of warts and will   receiv e 
either  CellFX or Cryosurgery . Randomization  will be implemented  through the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system  and will be stratified by [CONTACT_846309] (2 -4 warts or 5-8 
warts) .  The randomization assignment  will include the type of treatment  and all  randomized subjects  
will be include d in the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis.  
 
3.4  CellFX Procedure  
The intended CellFX treatment device is described as the CellFX ® System using the skin contact[CONTACT_648982] “tip” ranging in sizes  from 1.5 mm x 1.5 mm  to 10 .0 mm x 10.0 mm in 
length and width and may range from 1.0 to 3.0 mm in depth  depending on the wart location and 
size. Each tip will be used with pre -determined energy settings displayed on the CellFX Console and  
are provided  in Table 1 .  These  energy settings do no t exceed the maximum safe ranges of settings 
previously tested in clinical studies . A local anesthetic will be used to manage potential treatment 
discomfort during the CellFX  treatment.  All subjects will be monitored for muscle “twitching” during 
each Cell FX treatment and the subjects will be asked whether they felt any muscle “twitch” during 
the treatment.

6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATI ONS  
Further details of planned analyses can be found in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
 
6.1 Co-primary Endpoint s 
Clinical acceptance of treatment with the CellFX System for common warts  requires non -inferior 
clearance response (effectiveness) , non -inferior healing  processes and non -inferior rates of adverse 
skin changes (safety) versus cryosurgery . Because these  features are critically important for 
treatment acceptability, this study is designed with [ADDRESS_1176608] correlation. The co-primary safety en dpoint s are the proportion of warts  
with adverse events related to wound healing ( scabbing, swelling, crusting, blister, scar or ulcer ) at 
[ADDRESS_1176609] treatment and adverse skin changes ( the presence of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_846299] ) at [ADDRESS_1176610] treatment. The co-primary effectiveness endpoint 
is the proportion of warts  classified as “resolved” at [ADDRESS_1176611] CellFX or Cryosurgical treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_846320]. The wound healing  safety event is defined as the presence of scabbing, swelling, 
crusting, b lister, scar or ulcer . The timing of the evaluation of this endpoint is wart specific as 
some warts may not require multiple treatments with CellFX or Cryosurgery. Warts will be 
categorized as having a primary safety event if any component ( scabbing, swell ing, crusting, 
blister, scar or ulcer ) is present at the follow -up visit [ADDRESS_1176612] treatment .  
 
The statistical hypotheses to be evaluated for the wound healing primary safety endpoint are:  
H0: pCellFX - pCryo ≥ 15% at [ADDRESS_1176613] treatment, versus  
HA: pCellFX - pCryo < 15% at [ADDRESS_1176614] treatment  
 
Where pCellFX and pCryo are the proportion of wart s with a composite  wound healing  safety event 
(scabbing, swelling, crusting, blister, scar  or ulcer ) in each treatment group.  The null hypothesis 
will be rejected if the upper bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in 
proportions ( pCellFX - pCryo) is less than 15% . This approach is equivalent to a [ADDRESS_1176615] with a 
2.5% type I error rate.  
 
The sk in change safety endpoint  is the presence or absence of a skin change  safety event at [ADDRESS_1176616] CellFX or Cryosurgical treatment as assessed by [CONTACT_648986]. 
The skin change  safety event is defined as the presence of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring. The timing of the evaluation of this endpoint is wart specific as 
some warts may not require multiple treatments with CellFX or Cryosurgery. Warts will be 
NP-WC-015 – CellFX vs Cryosurgery  Wart Study  
                   
   
Page 23 of 41  
categorized as having a skin change  safety event if any component (hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring) is present at  the follow -up visit [ADDRESS_1176617] treatment .  
 
The statistical hypotheses to be evaluated for the skin change primary safety endpoint are:  
H0: pCellFX - pCryo ≥ 15% at [ADDRESS_1176618] treatment, versus  
HA: pCellFX - pCryo < 15% at [ADDRESS_1176619] treatment  
Where p CellFX and p Cryo are the proportion of warts with a composite skin change safety event 
(hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring) in each treatment group. The null 
hypothesis will be rejected if the upper bound of the 2 -sided  95% confidence interval for the 
difference in proportions (p CellFX - pCryo) is less than 15%. This approach is equivalent to a [ADDRESS_1176620] with a 2.5% type I error rate.  
 
6.1.2 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is wart clearance, defined as “resolved” versus “not 
resolved” at  [ADDRESS_1176621] CellFX or Cryosurgical treatment ( [ADDRESS_1176622] 
treatment) based on the classification of the blinded site investigator. The  timing of the 
evaluation of this endpoint is wart specific as some warts may not require more than 1 
treatment with the CellFX System or Cryosurgery. The investigator, blinded to treatment 
assignment, will classify each wart  as “resolved” or “not resolved ”.  
 
The primary effectiveness analysis will be a comparison between CellFX and Cryosurgical 
treatment groups based on 30-day post treatment clearance  rate, defined as the proportion of 
warts classified as “resolved” . This binary outcome classifies warts as completely clear versus 
not completely clear.  The [ADDRESS_1176623] of spontaneous 
wart resolution unrelated to treatment.  
 
The statistical hypotheses to be evaluated for the primary efficacy endpoint are: 
 
H0: pCellFX - pCryo ≤ -15% at [ADDRESS_1176624] treatment, versus  
HA: pCellFX - pCryo > -15% at [ADDRESS_1176625] treatment  
 
Where p CellFX and pCryo are the proportion of wart s classified as “resolved”  in each treatment 
group.  The null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower  bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference in proportions (p CellFX - pCryo) is greater than  -15%, which is equivalent 
to a [ADDRESS_1176626] with a 2.5% type I error rate.  
 
6.1.3  Justificat ion of Non -Inferiority Design and Margin  
The selection of a non -inferiority design for this study is based on the choice of an active 
comparator ( cryosurgery ), the acceptability of the design to subjects seeking treatment for 
common warts , and feasibility considerations11. Although cryosurgical treatment for warts was 
found to have numerically higher efficacy compared to placebo15, the many variations in timin g, 
frequency and delivery of cryosurgery preclude a meta -analysis -based margin derivation for the 
technique selected for this study . Safety outcomes are inconsistently reported in publications, 
and no estimates of the composite endpoint of skin changes pro posed for this study was 
available . Thus, n on-inferiority margins of 15% were selected  based on clinical judgement for the 
primary safety and effectiveness endpoints.  Clinical justifications for this non -inferiority margin 
NP-WC-015 – CellFX vs Cryosurgery  Wart Study  
                   
   
Page 24 of 41  
for safety include existing CellF X safety data that demonstrate no serious adverse events , and  a 
comparable safety profile compared to the predicate devices for this indication with the 
suggestion of faster healing . Clinical justifications for a 15% non -inferiority margin for 
effectivenes s include consistency of treatment and ease of use with the CellFX system . 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1176627] treatment. The 3 observers will classify each wart as “resolved” or “not resolved”  
described in Section 6.1.2 . The wart will be classified as “resolved”  if 2/3 blinded observers 
classify the wart as “resolved” , and as “not resolved”  if 2/3 blinded observers classified the wart 
as “not resolved” . The d ifference in proportion of warts classified as “resolved” will be assessed 
using the GEE model  as described in the statistical analysis plan with the photo review endpoint 
replacing the endpoint derived from the blinded site investigator classification .  
2.   Wart Resolution after Single Treatment  
The proportion in each treatment group and the d ifferen ce in proportion classified as 
“resolved”  between CellFX and Cryosurgery assigned by [CONTACT_846321] 30-
days post initial treatment  (as opposed to the efficacy endpoint, which is [ADDRESS_1176628] 
treatment) will be assessed using the GEE  model described in the statistical analysis plan  with 
the [ADDRESS_1176629] Treatment  
The proportion in each treatment group and the d ifference in proportion classified as 
“resolved”   between CellFX and Cryosurgery assigned by [CONTACT_846322] [ADDRESS_1176630] treatment endpoint based on the blinded 
investigator classification as “resolved” or “not resolved” . 
4.   Within Subject Effectiveness  
The ratio of cleared warts  (classified as “resolved” ) to all treated warts  will be calculated at [ADDRESS_1176631] treatment. The proportion of subjects with complete clearance of all warts (ratio 
1) will be calculated for each treatment group, as well as the proportions with > 50% and > 75% 
of treated warts cleared.  
5.   Change in Wart Size  
The mean difference in reduction from baseline in wart size of treated warts at [ADDRESS_1176632] -squar e mean 
change, difference, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated from this model.

Page [ADDRESS_1176633] treatment between 
CellFX and Cryosurgery .  Lesion  evaluation includes the following:  
• Blister Formation  
• Bruising  
• Crusting  
• Erythema  
• Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  
• Hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  
• Scabbing  
• Scarring  
• Swelling  or Edema  
• Ulceration  
 
The rate of each event individually and a composite of any of these events will be calculated for 
each treatment using the GEE model described in the statistical analysis plan , along with the 
95% confidence i nterval as described for the primary safety endpoint . 
 
8. Satisfaction with Treatment  
A 6-point Treatment  Satisfaction Scale will be used to measure subject’s satisfaction with the 
treatment of each wart.

The proportion with each response will be summarized. An analysis will be performed using the 
binary endpoints of satisfied (“Very Satisfied” or “Satisfied”) versus not satisfied  (“Somewhat 
Satisfied”, “Somewhat Dissatisfied”, “Dissatisfied”, “Very Dissat isfied”) to compare satisfaction 
across treatment groups. As with treatment -level clearance , the counts and proportions of 
warts  categorized as satisfied will be reported. A GEE model to estimate the treatment 
difference in the proportion of warts with sat isfactory treatment will be performed  using the 
methods described in the statistical analysis plan .  
 
9. Acute Pain Assessment  
Face Pain Scale with an assigned numerical rating between 0 (smiling) and 10 (crying) will  be 
used to assess pain immediately after the CellFX and Cryosurgical  treatmen ts at Day 0 , and Days 
30, or 60, if applicable. The face pain scale will be assessed immediately after each wart  
treatment . Please see pain scale chart on the next page .

treatments separately . A histogram of scores will be produced. If the scores are not markedly 
skewed, mixed  models using score as a continuous dependent variable and treatment as a fixed 
covariate (adjusted for within -subject correlation) will be used to compare the least -square 
mean difference in pain scores across treatment groups. A model including all treat ments and 
adjusted for treatment number (initial, first retreatment, second retreatment) may be 
performed for comparison, convergence permitting.

warts.  
 
The efficacy  response rate (classified as “resolved” versus “not resolved”) was approximated using 
the complete clearance rate for common warts , yielding an estimated  CellFX clearance  rate at [ADDRESS_1176636] treatment of 75.5 %. The within -subject correlation for this endpoint was estimated 
to be 0.3. The composite wound healing safety event at [ADDRESS_1176637] treatment was estimated 
to be 37. 6%, and the within -subject correlation was estimated to be 0.[ADDRESS_1176638] treatment was estimated to be 32.5%, and the within -
subject correlation for this endpoint was estimated to be 0.[ADDRESS_1176639] 
treatment clear ance  rate was estimated to be 70%14,[ADDRESS_1176640] treatment safety 
event rate was estimated to be 40% (based on 29% hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_846300] 11% 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_846301] ). 15 The wound healing safety event rate for cryotherapy was assumed 
to be 43%.  The within -subject correlation for warts was assumed to be identical for CellFX and 
cryosurgery. N o type -[ADDRESS_1176641] 88% 
power to test the primary hypotheses using 15% non -inferiority margins, approxi mately 97 warts 
(33 subjects) would be required in each arm. After accounting for within -subject correlation, at 
least 63 subjects ( 189 warts) are needed in each arm. To account for approximately 15% loss to 
follow -up, a total of 150 subjects will be enrol led. 
 
6.4 Populations for Analyses  
The primary analysis dataset for study outcomes will be the intent -to-treat (ITT) population wherein 
data from all randomized wart s will be analyzed based on the intended randomization assignment. 
The intent of this protocol is to apply up to 3 sessions of  each treatment, but no wart s will be

Page [ADDRESS_1176642] one treatment , and the primary efficacy analysis will also 
be calculated for this population for comparison . The modified ITT population will be the analysis 
population for the primary safety endpoint.  
 
Study outcomes will also be  analyzed using a per -protocol (PP) population. The PP population 
includes all subjects who had no pre -specified inclusion and exclusion violations, received either 
CellFX or Cryosurgery , and repeated the treatments per protocol for any wart s classified as “not 
resolved”  at the 30 -day and/or 60-day visit.  
 
6.5 Sub -Group Analyses  
Primary and secondary endpoints will be evaluated for the ITT and PP populations, as well as  
analyzed in strata based on the following sub -groups:  
 
• Number of treated wa rts (2 to 4 or 5-8) 
• Age 
• Prior treatment for treated warts  
• Gender  
• Clinical Site  
• Treatment Energy Level  
• Size of  CellFX Treatment  Tip 
• Total Energy Density  
• Number of Treatments  
 
These analyses are meant to assess consistency of treatment effects only, and this study is not 
powered for inference within subgroups.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1176643] treatment results, and a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -point analysis will be 
performed for the endpoints at 90 days to d etermine whether the missing data could change the 
inference compared to the primary models.

will be provided by [CONTACT_73956], Canfield Scientific, Inc. (Parsippany, NJ) to document 
Investigator selected warts at enrollment,  post treatment and at [ADDRESS_1176649] CellF X treatment or Cryosurgical procedure.   All consenting subjects’ study 
photographs will be captured using the equipment, supplies, and guidelines provided by [CONTACT_846323].   Images will be 
captured, viewed, and uploaded using Canfield Capture software which automatically checksums, 
encrypts, packages, and transfers the data to a secure, validated , and compliant web server hosted by 
[CONTACT_73957].    Detailed instructions for all a spects of the photography procedures will be supplied separately 
in the investigator user manual to be provided by [CONTACT_73957].  
 
9.0 INDEPENDENT PANEL REVIEW  
To meet the  requirements of the secondary endpoint , an Independent Panel  will evaluate  the treatment 
response from  each study device . In order to enhance objectivity and reduce potential for bias, the Panel 
shall be independent of the Sponsor as well as the study sites/investigators.   
 
The Panel  is made up of three   clinicians with pertinent expertise in dermatology who are not participants 
in the study and who do not have any other real or potential conflicts of interest. The Panel will be  
provided photographs of all treated wart s at baseline and [ADDRESS_1176650] t reatment and will be trained 
on specific criteria used to classify the response to treatment as noted in study Section 6.1.2.

methodology .  
 
 
10.0  ADVERSE EVENTS  
Pulse Biosciences will classify each reported Adverse Event according to ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011. All protocol 
specific AEs, whether device -related or not, will be recorded on the AE case report form  and reported . 
Data to be collected will include the descri ption of the AE, onset , and resolution dates (or whether the 
AE is ongoing), severity, management/treatment, outcome, and determination of the relationship to 
the device and/or procedure. All AEs related to a treated wart   should be reported and classified  by [CONTACT_846324].   
All AE information will be collected  at each study visit  from enrollment through [ADDRESS_1176652] 
CellFX and Cryosurgical  procedures. All AEs will be followed until the event has resolved (in the case of 
permanent impairment, the event will be followed until it stabilizes, and the overall clinical out come has 
been ascertained).  
 
When reporting AEs/SAEs, the Investigator should include the following information:  
• Description of event  
• Onset of event  
• Duration of event  
• Severity  
• Relationship to device  or procedure  
• Action taken  
• Subject  outcome  
 
Severity describes the intensity of an event and will be assessed as:  
• Mild : The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning 
level.  
• Moderate : The AE produces some impairment of function but not hazardous to health.  
• Severe : The AE produces significant impairment of function or incapacities and/or it is a hazard 
to the subject.  
 
Relationship to device or procedure will be assessed as:  
• Unlikely : There is no indication that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_118448] l or standard of 
care  device.  
• Possibly : It cannot be excluded that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_746091].  
• Likely : A causal  relationship between the investigational  or standard of care  device and the 
AE is at least a reasonabl e possibility; i.e. there is evidence or argument suggesting a causal 
relationship.

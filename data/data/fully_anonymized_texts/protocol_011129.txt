 1 OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1.1 Primary objective  
 
To evaluate the feasibility and safety  of the use of  antibiotic solution instillation 
following intraoperative diagnosis of complex appendicitis. We will determine 
feasibility by [CONTACT_427531] (1) agree to participate, and 
(2) complete all intervention sessions and measurement time points. Safety will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_427532] -peritoneal antibiotic 
instillation for the treatment of peritonitis caused by [CONTACT_427533].  
1.1.[ADDRESS_540309] icated  
appendicitis: operative tim e, length of stay, post -operative antibiotic use, post -
operative pain medication use, need for post -operative imaging, readmission rates, 
and the development of intra -peritoneal abscess  requiring percutaneous aspi[INVESTIGATOR_182491]/or drainage  within [ADDRESS_540310] common abdominal surgical emergency in children , affecting 
approximately 75,000 children a year .[1, 2]  Mitigating the associated morbidities of this disease 
process is of paramount concern to the pediatric surgeon. [1] In complicate d or complex appendicitis, 
the infectious process  is noted to have progressed beyond the confines of the appendix, which  leads 
to purulent fluid in the intra -peritoneal  space  (diffuse exudate outside of the right lower quadrant  
(RLQ) /pelvis) , a visible hol e (perforation ) of the appendix, an extra -luminal fecalith, or an intra -
peritoneal abscess. Complex appendicitis occurs in up to 20% of all cases of appendicitis and is 
associated with a much higher morbidity and mortality than its simple counterpart. [1, 3-5] 
The ensuing systemic response from complex appendicitis has a significant impact on the 
patient and their families. Complex appendicitis results in significant morbidity , with increased rates 
of intra -peritoneal abscess formation, and surgical site infections, as well as increased length of stay.  
[6, 7]  The increased  inflammation and bacterial insult can result in  urinary retention, diarrhea, 
increased pain, and a high incidence of deep organ space infection . [6] In the peritoneal space, 
infection can progress to form an intra -abdominal abscess , which is treated with intravenous 
antibiotics and often percutaneous or operative drainage. All of these factors  in combination with the 
increased level of systemic insult experienced by [CONTACT_102], correlate with longer and more costly 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], incr eased need for advanced imaging leading to more  radiation exposure , prolonged 
antibiotic use, and increased discomfort and generalized malaise, more time away from school, 
work, and home.  
Current management strategies for intra -operatively diagnosed comple x appendicitis include 
appendectomy with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427508] -peritoneal fluid followed by [CONTACT_427534] -operative 
treatment with intravenous or oral antibiotic therapy. [8] Previous studies have not seen dramatic

 improvements with antibio tic irrigation, large volume irrigation, or prophylactic intra-peritoneal 
drain use to prevent intra -abdominal abscess formation. [9-18] As such, the search continues to find 
an answer to the high rate of deep space infection associated with complex appendicitis, which can  
be as high as  45%. [5, 19]   
Interventions to counter these negative effects currently focus on the aftermath of an intra -
abdominal abscess and how to manage it once it has been identified. Previous studies have 
investigated the use of peritoneal irrigation  solutions (with or without antibiotics)  at the time of 
surgery, in hopes of decreasing  intra-abdominal abscess rates  and length of stay  following 
appendecto my, but the se studies did not show any significant improvement in abscess rates after 
irrigation  compared to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427507] .[5, 18, 20]  These previous studies may not have observed an 
improvement in post -operative complications given that they did  not allow for the antibiotic solution 
to remain in the intraperitoneal space .  
The current  pi[INVESTIGATOR_427509], which would be a significant improvement to the 
existing standard of care.  Currently there is no literature tha t describes utilizing antibiotic instillation 
in the treatment of complicated appendicitis, thus this pi[INVESTIGATOR_427510] a large multicenter trial.  Pending feasibility of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , our project  
will further  study the length of stay, and potential preven tion of intra -abdominal abscess. The 
outcomes of this limited efficacy testing will be an important initial step to designing a larger, 
multicenter trial which is powered to show improved postoperat ive outcomes with decreased 
postoperative abscess formation in complicated appendicitis.  
We believe that after appendectomy and removal of the nidus of disease, the post -operative 
field would benefit from  treatment  with an antibiotic instillation, a solut ion placed in the peritoneal  
cavity in direct contact [CONTACT_427535]. By [CONTACT_427536], the contaminated areas are topi[INVESTIGATOR_427511]  (). This technique will give appropriate temporal contact [CONTACT_427537],  allow ing for bet ter dispersion, and optimize d efficacy.   
In patients with peritoneal dialysis catheters, infection of these catheters can lead to 
peritonitis, or inflammation of the peritoneal cavity, which, in turn can progress to sepsis. Peritonitis 
associated with infected peritoneal dialysis catheters is treated with antibiotic instillation into the 
peritoneal cavity with demonstrated success an d is currently considered the standard of care 
treatment. [21-24] Intra -peritoneal antibiotic instillation is the current standard of care  for treatment 
of peritonitis associated with PD catheters. [25] Given that intra -peritoneal antibiotic instillation is 
the standard of care for PD catheter associated peritonitis, it should also be safe  to use for any type 
of peritonitis, and in this case, peritonitis due to complicated appendicitis.  
Recently, the treatment regimens have shifted away from continuous use of antibiotic 
instillations during PD sessions and have moved towards intermittent antibiotic instillations with 
daily dosing. [26, 27]  The International Soc iety for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) recommends at least a 
6 hour dwell time for intermittent antibiotic instillation to allow for adequate absorption. [25] The 
ISPD guidelines also suggest that cephalospor ins be administered on a daily intermittent basis, or 
continuously (with each exchange), as there is no significant difference in peritonitis treatment 
outcomes with these dosing regimens. [25] Given the  broad coverage , we believe that the intra -
peritoneal use of ceftriaxone will lead to better treatment of complex appendicitis and potentially 
decreased incidence  of intra -abdominal abscesses . This aligns with typi[INVESTIGATOR_427512] a ssociated with PD catheters, which have been successful. [22, 26, 28] Second or  third 
generation cephalosporins are the standard of care  antibiotics used pre -operatively prior to an 
appendectomy.  At our institution pre -operative intravenous (IV)  ceftriaxone  (50mg/kg/day ,

 maximum 2g daily ) and metronidazole  (30mg/kg/day)  therapy is used as pre -operative antibiotic 
treatment prior to pediatric appendectomy . [29] Intravenous ceftriaxone  (50mg/kg/day , maximum 2g 
daily ) and metronidazole (30mg/kg/day) is given post -operatively following the diagnosis of 
complicated appendicitis for a minimum of  [ADDRESS_540311] with the inflamed area of  the RLQ following removal of the 
nidus of infection, or the appendix . A small volume of instilled ceftriaxone (~10ml solution total)  
will be used  so as not to instill a significant amount of additional fluid into the peritoneal cavity.  
The idea of surgic al source control paired with direct antibiotic instillation and application to 
the area of infection is an innovative approach to the tradit ional treatment scheme of complic ated 
appendicitis which could be instrumental in decreasing post -operative complic ations. Antibiotic 
instillation into the peritoneal cavity after appendectomy gives maximal contact [CONTACT_427538], and leads to elevated local antibiotic concentration. To our 
knowledge, no study has ever sought t o use antibiotics as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], retained solution in an i nfected 
peritoneum due to complic ated appendicitis. We believe  that by [CONTACT_427539], 
that the overall response will be better bacterial control and decreased rates of intra -abdominal 
abscess formation and complications. This is a new concept and has not yet been reported in 
pediatric patients with  complicated appendicitis. The long-term goal of the study is to compare 
incidence of postoperative deep organ space infection following our standard of care (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427513]-peritoneal infected fluid only) compared with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427514] -peritoneal infected fluid 
followed by [CONTACT_427540] . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_427515] a larger study to evaluate  the 
effectiveness of this treatment scheme.  
 
2.1 Benefit  / Risk Assessment   
Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical diagnoses in t he pediatric population and 
the most common surgical emergency in children. [1, 2]  In complex appendicitis, the sequelae have 
progressed beyond the confines of the organ, and have led to purulent fluid in the intra -abdominal 
space, spi[INVESTIGATOR_427516] , or gross perforation of the appendix. Complicated appendicitis 
occurs in u p to 20 % of cases and is associated wit h a much higher morbidity and mortality . [5] 
Previous studies have shown that local treatment of peritonitis  associated with PD catheters  with 
intra-peritoneal antibiotics has had significant improvement of outcomes. [22, 23, 26, 28]  The intra -
peritoneal route is preferable as compared to oral and intravenous a ntibiotic administra tion due to  
elevated local levels of the antibiotic  above the minimum inhibitory concentration while avoiding 
venipuncture and systemic side effects .[25, 26]  There is minimal risk associated with involvement in 
this study given tha t we will be screening for any history of allergies to penicillin  or cephalosporins , 
and excluding these patients . Ceftriaxone  is commercially available, has a low risk profile, and is  
generally well tolerated  with minimal side effects .  
 Our treatment period will include a one -time intra -operative dose of intra-peritoneal 
ceftriaxone . Typi[INVESTIGATOR_427517] -peritoneal ceftriaxone  administration occur on a daily 
basis, so our treatment period will also include the 24 hours foll owing intra -peritoneal administration 
of ceftriaxone.  All patients diagnosed with acute complicate d appendicitis intra -operatively, and 
entered into our study, will also receive a minimum 48 hours of intravenous antibiotics as an 
inpatient, allowing for co ntinued observation.   We will be treating pediatric patients who are intra -

the appendix, extra -luminal fecalith, diffuse fibropurulent exudate outside the RLQ/pelvis, or 
intraperitoneal abscess . All patients will have been admitted to Johns Hopkins All Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a diagnosis of acute appendicitis prior to surgical intervention. Patients will then be 
randomized  once diagnosed  with complex append icitis intra -operatively. Patients with allergies to 
penicillin  or cephalosporins  will be excluded pre -operatively, as well as patients who  do not meet the 
weight requirement,  are pregnant, have a history of neurological conditions such as encephalopathy, 
seizures, myoclonus and non -convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] , have a known inability to complete a

Ceftriaxone is a white powder, w hich is soluble in water. In this study ceftriaxone crystalline powder 
will be dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride solution prior to intra -peritoneal instillation.  
 
1g of ceftriaxone will dissolve in 9ml of 0.9% of sodium chloride solution, and  when fully 
withdrawn should  result in a total volume of just about 10ml (9.8ml) for intra -peritoneal instillation.  
 
4  STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Prospective Randomized Open with Bl inding of Endpoint (PROBE)  pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] 2  
study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the use of antibiotic instillation in the treatment of 
complex acute appendicitis. All children equal to or greater than 20kg diagnosed  with acute 
appendicitis and undergoing urgent appendectomy  will be approached for enrollment  for this study. 
As there is poor pre -operative diagnostic accuracy for simple versus complex appendicitis, all  
eligible  patients  presenting with acute appendicitis  and their families will be app roached for consent.  
Intra -operative assessment will diagnose  complex appendicitis . Complex appendicitis will be 
defined as presence of any of the following: visible hole in the appendix, extra -luminal fecalith, 
diffuse fibropurulent exudate outside the ri ght lower quadrant (RLQ)/pelvis, or intraperitoneal 
abscess.  Patients will be e xcluded  if they undergo  non-operative  management of appendicitis, do not 
undergo appendectomy at the time of operation, weigh  less than 20kg, are pregnant, are unable to 
complete a 30day postoperative follow up, have impaired renal function  (CrCl <15mL/min) , have a 
history of neurological conditions (such as encephalopathy, seizures, myoclonus, and non -
convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]), or are allergic to penici llin or cephalosporin s that prohibit  the use of 
the antibiotic intra -peritoneal instillation.  Patients with  a history of  anaphylactic reaction s to 
penicillin or cephalosporins will be excluded from this study.  Patients with a penicillin aller gy who 
have pr eviously received IV cephalosporins without allergic reaction will be considered for inclusion 
in this study.

 Study partic ipants will be randomized in a 1 :1 ratio  using permuted  blocks of 4 and 6 using a 
computer -generated  randomization scheme . The treatment category assignments will be placed in 
consecutive numbered envelopes  concealed from study staff until randomization . In the operating 
room , once the patient is diagnosed with  complicated  appendicitis , then the next sequential envelope 
will be opened and the patient will be assigned to that treatment arm. The surgeon  and team  
administering the treatment will not be blinded; however, patients, their families, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427518] . Post-operative protocols 
will be the same for both groups and includes  continuation  of intravenous antibiotics  (Study Schema, 
and Fig 1 ). Once complex appendicitis is diagnosed, and a successful appendectomy occur s, then the 
patient will be transitioned to intravenous ceftriaxone (50mg/kg/day , maximum 2g daily ) and 
metronidazole  (30mg/kg/day) post-operatively . Both study groups will receive a minimum 
additional [ADDRESS_540313] -
spectrum oral antibiotics or continued on intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole until their 
discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Our standardized discharge criteria inclu des: temperature less than 
38.5ºC  for the previous [ADDRESS_540314] been met, and  at the surgeon’s discretion, the 
patient will be discharged home with routine follow -up (either a clinic visit , telemedicine visit,  or a 
phone call)  within [ADDRESS_540315] -operative day 7 (plus or minus 1 day) related t o 
postoperative care of complicat ed appendicitis, and does not meet discharge criteria as listed, then 
they will undergo  subsequent imagin g studies  (abdominal ultrasound or CT abdomen -pelvis) to 
evaluate  for intra -abdominal abscess  or phlegmon . If patients are found to have an abscess  or 
phlegmon,  they will continue to receive ongoing  antibiotic trea tment with or without percutaneous 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427519]/or drainage at the discretion of the surgeon and interventional radiologist.   
Patients will  undergo teleph one, telemedicine visit,  or in-person clinic  follow -up within [ADDRESS_540316]-operative length of stay .  
An independent clinical endpoint committee will be formed to evaluate for study related 
complications and endpoints.  For consistency and future ease of a prospective multicenter trial, 
definitions of intraoperative findings of complicated appendicitis, postoperative percutaneous 
drainage or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427520], surgical site infection, postoperative sepsis, 
readmi ssion and/or reoperation will be reported according to the National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program Pediatric Operations Manual, January 2022 edition. [31]  
We will evaluate patient retention and recruitment along with the process of instilling 
antibi otic solution into the intra -peritoneal space in this feasibility study. We will primarily focus on 
recruitment, enrollment, and retention rates in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We  will also evaluate patient 
outcomes associated with intra -peritoneal instillation of an tibiotics to determine not only post -
operative complication rates, but also length of stay, pain scores, pain medication use, superficial 
surgical site infections, and adverse events related to the antibiotic instillation. Patients and their 
families will be blinded to their randomized treatment groups, and will be followed for 30 days 
following appendectomy .

7 ANTIBIOTIC INSTILLATION INTERVENTION  PLAN  
7.1 Interven tion Schedule  
 All patients  equal to or greater than  20kg  presenting to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423353] a diagnosis of acute appendicitis and are scheduled to undergo urgent appendectomy  will be 
approached for participation in this study. Intra -operatively their eligibility to participate in the 
study will be determined. If complex appendicitis is found intra -operatively then the patient will 
be randomized into the  control group ( standard of care arm  with intra-peritonea l fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_427522]), or the  study group (intra -peritoneal fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_39870] n and antibiotic solution instillation) . 
Antibiotic instillation will be introduced into the RLQ/pelvis  after the appendectomy i s complete d 
and all intra -peritoneal fluid is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831] . Ceftriaxone solution will be used depending on 
availability and pharmac y stock for use at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The ceftriaxone 
powder ( 1g) will be dissolved in 9 ml of sterile normal saline . The entire contents of reconstituted 
powder will be fully withdrawn  for a total instillation volume of 10ml . This fluid  will then be 
instilled and left to dwell in the area of the peritoneal cavity where the appendix was removed.

8 TOXI CITIES AND DOSE  MODIFICATION  
 
This s tudy will utilize  the CTCAE (N CI Common Terminology Criter ia for Adverse Events) version 
5.0 for adverse events and serious adverse event reporting .  A copy of the CTCAE Version 5 .0 can 
be downloaded:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Refer
ence_8.5x11.pdf  
8.1 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after starting the study intervention  even if the event is not considered to be 
related to study intervention . For the purposes of this study, the terms toxicity and adverse event 
are used interchangeably. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study intervention . Abnormal la boratory 
values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
 
AEs will be collected from the date of the operative intervention (with or without instill ation of 
antibiotics) to [ADDRESS_540324] or other 
means, will be  collected, recorded , and followed as appropriate.  
 
Date: September 2 7, 202 3 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_205219] M. Chandler, MD  
Application Number: IRB00323208  
Page [ADDRESS_540325], or other assessments. As far as po ssible, each adverse event should 
be evaluated to determine  at a minimum : 
1. The severity grade based on CTCAE v. 5 (grade 1 -5) 
2. Its relationship to the study intervention  (definite, probable, possible, unlikely, unrelated)  
3. Its duration (start and end dates or  if continuing at final exam)  
4. Whether it constitutes an SAE  
 
All adverse events are expected to be  treated appropriately. Once an adverse event is detected, it 
will be followed until its resolution . 
 
Information about common side effects already known about the commercial drug ( third 
generation cephalosporin)  is described in the Drug Information (section 3) and the FDA -
approved product labels. This information is included in the participant  informed co nsent and/or 
assent and will be discussed with the participant during the study, as needed.  
 
All adverse events are recorded in the participant  research chart.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Information about all serious adverse events is collected and recorded.  A serious adverse 
event is one  which  meets any of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal or life -threatening  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Causes congenital anom aly or birth defect  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
o Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, (such as  ongoing pain, 
fever, constipation, bowel obstruction, sur gical site infections, or other infections ) 
o Elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug  
o Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
o Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_6534]’s  
general condition  
o Is medically significant (i.e. defined as  an event that jeopardizes the participant or 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above)  
 
Events  that fall within the definitions listed above must be reported as SAEs, irrespective of 
whether  they are judged  to be related to treatment or not. If an event is not an AE per the 
definition in section 9.1 , then it cannot be an SAE, even if serious conditions are met (e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death due to progression of disease etc.).  However, such events may meet JHM  
IRB reportable definitions as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961] (see section  9.3). Toxicities unrelated to treatment that

Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_205219] M. Chandler, MD  
Application Number: IRB00323208  
Page [ADDRESS_540326] simply be documented as AEs in the participant  
research chart.   
 
Collection of serious adverse events will begin after the patient is randomized into the study  
intra-operatively and will end 48 hours after administration of the intra -peritoneal antibiotics. It 
is very unlikely that any serious adverse event will occur given that this study intervention uses a 
commercially available antibiotic that is routinely administered both parenterally and locally . 
Adverse events due to intra -peritoneal antibiotic instillation may be difficult to distinguish given 
that simi lar antibiotics will be given intravenously .  
8.3 Unant icipated Problems Involving Risks to Participants or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_427501])  
JHM IRB defines UPI[INVESTIGATOR_427524], 
severity, or frequency given the research procedures described in the protocol, the informed 
consent form,  and the characteristics of the participant populations AND indicates that 
participants or others are at greater risk of harm (physical, psychological, economic, or social) 
than previously known or recognized.  Events meeting the JHM IRB requirements for UPI[INVESTIGATOR_427525] 
(https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/institutional_review_board/guidelines_policies/organization_
polic ies/103_6b.html ) are reported promptly to JHM  IRB.   
 
8.4 Reporting Requirements  
SAEs will be reported to  the overall PI , and the IRB . 
 
SAE and UPI[CONTACT_58468] O Reporting to the IRB:  
• Events meeting the JHM IRB requirements for UP IRSOs will be  reported promptly to the 
IRB.   
 
The MedWatch report will be submitted to the FDA through the voluntary reporting method by 
[CONTACT_978]. 
A MedWatch 3500A form must be completed and submitted to the FDA as soon as possible, but 
no later than [ADDRESS_540327] knowledge or notification of event (5 days for fatal or life-threatening  
event) .

for categorical variables as appropriate . All statistical analyses will be performed  with SAS v 9.4 or 
a newer version . 
 
 
Analysis for Aim 1 . 
The primary aim of this study is to determine  the feasibility and safety  of the use of antibiotic 
solution instillation following intraoperative diagnosis of complex appendicitis.  We will 
determine feasibility by [CONTACT_427531] (1)  agree to participate, 
and (2) complete all intervention sessions and measurement time points. Safety will be 
determined by [CONTACT_427532] -peritoneal antibiotic instillation 
for the treatment of peritonitis caused by [CONTACT_427544] x appendicitis.  For feasibility, we will report 
the proportions with corresponding 95% confidence intervals  for eligibility, recruitment, 
enrollment, withdrawals and drop outs, and study completion . We will also collect 
information on  barriers and issues o f implementation.  The study will be deemed feasible if  
>50% of  potential participants agree  to participate and at least 75% of  them  complet e all 
measurement time points. These benchmarks are based on a previous similar study 
completed in this population. [ 29]. For safety we will report the incidence of adverse effect 
with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.  
 
  
Analyse s for secondary aims  
We will perform an e xploratory efficacy analysis  to compare the antibiotic solution instillation  group 
and the control  participants  on outcome  measures . We will initially  compare categorical outcomes  
using Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate and independent t -test or Mann Whitney U 
test for continuous variables as appropriate . We will attempt to use logistic or linear regression as 
appropriate for the outcome measure  to adjust for baseline characteristics  that differ between  the 
groups. The main analysis for this aim will be a modified intention -to-treat for the primary analysis. 
For this analysis, pat ients will be compared in the two arms based on how they were randomized and 
it will include all patients that were randomized and received surgery. We will also perform 
supportive  per protocol and as treated analyses . Based on historical data from our institution, we 
anticipate that <1% of patient s who are initially randomized to one arm may switch to the other arm 
during surgery and approximately <1% may not complete the surgery. These patients will be 
considered as a protocol violation  and will be excluded from the per protocol analysis. The as treated 
analysis will group the patients according to the type of surgery they actually received and exclude 
those that did not complete or receive surgery.  The analyses for this aim will be exploratory, as the 
study is not powered to detect clinically important differences between groups using these analyses. 
However, the findings from these analyses will be used to guide the design of a future larger study 
that will include a ppropriate sample size estimations or power analyses.  
 
Attrition and Missing Data :  
We will make every effort to reduce attrition. Missing data will be characterized and 
examined for non -randomness. M issing data will  not be imputed .

Page 22 of 25 
 The primary aim of this stu dy is to assess feasibility  of the proposed intervention to inform a 
future larger  randomized controlled trial. Therefore , the sample size is not based on a power 
analysis . A sa mple size of 36 participants (18 intervention and 18  control) is appropriate to provide 
feasibility data that will help refine our intervention and measurements for a future larger stud y.[30] 
This sample size will allow us to estimate a conservative participation of 70% with a confidence 
interval of 53 -87%. In a similar study conducted by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_427528], 85% of recruited families 
consented to randomization and > 93% of those families completed all study assessments .  
Based on current estimates  in our institution, we anticipate 35 0 appendectomies to be 
performed each year. Assuming the average documented 20% perforation rate , we anticipate [ADDRESS_540334] an eligible pool of 
70 patients with intra -operatively diagnosed complicated  appendiciti s. [29]   
 
Study Monitoring and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] : 
 All patients will be monitored in the post -operative p eriod, particularly the first [ADDRESS_540335] 12 hours of treatment.  At any time in the study, if a 
patient suffer s an adverse event secondary to intra -peritonea l antibiotic instillation, all study activity 
will be suspended until a full investigation is complete d. The study will only be reinstated after 
consultation with the Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39047]. Patients with severe allergies to 
cephalospori ns or penicillin will be excluded from the study.   
 
13 DATA SUBMISSION SCHEDULE  
The Case Report Forms (CRFs) are a set of (electronic or paper) forms for each participant  that 
provide  a record of the data generated according to the protocol.   CRF’s should be created prior to 
the study being initiated and updated (if applicable) when amendments to the protocol are IRB 
approved.   Data capture should be restricted to endpoints and relevan t participant  information 
required for planned manuscripts.   These forms will be completed on an on -going basis during the 
study.   The medical records will be source of verification of the data.   During the study, the CRFs 
may be monitored for completeness , accuracy, legibility and attention to detail by a member of the 
Regulatory  Affairs / Quality Assurance department . The CRFs are completed by [CONTACT_29517] a 
member of the study team as listed on the Delegation of Authority l og. The Investigator agrees to 
allow  Regulatory Affairs / Quality Assurance personnel access to participants’ source documents, 
clinical supplies dispensing and storage area, and study documentation for  the above -mentioned 
purpose.

Study Protocol  
Naloxone for Optimizing Hypoxemia of Lung Donors (NO -HOLDS)  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
 
Date: August 14, [ADDRESS_131451] Goals  
1. Evaluate whether naloxone can improve oxygenation / reverse hypoxemia in lung -eligible brain -
dead (BD) organ donors  
2. Demonstrate feasibility of prospective multi -OPO clinical trials as part of the ODRC  
Study Population  (determined at initiation of OPO management)  
1. Lung -eligible BD donors (age  13-70, no established severe lung disease – e.g. COPD ) 
2. Arterial hypoxemia (P:F ratio < [ADDRESS_131452] ABG after initial OPO stabilization ) 
Study Protocol  
1. All OPO -specific  donor protocols (incl. lung optimization) should be followed  
a. Does not require any other change to practice or donor management  
2. Randomization occurs for eligible donors after initial ABG  (stratified by [CONTACT_384])  
3. Naloxone 8 mg IV  (or saline) given once  
a. Co-administered with a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMB)   
b. Blinding of drug vs. placebo done at each OPO with sequential unmarked syringes (prefilled 
with naloxone or saline and numbered with central code)  
Outcome Measures  
1. Change in P:F ratio  to final ABG  – ABG obtained on 100% FiO2, PEEP 5  
2. Change in P:F ratio to early ABG  
3. Lungs recovered / transplanted  (if not – reason, e.g. hypoxemia vs. COPD, other  RO) 
 
SRTR variables for O:E calculation  (incl. age, race, ABO, smoker)  
 Most of this could be abstracte d post -hoc from OPO database  
 Only study registration (with UNOS & OPO ID) entered into study -specific on -line database  
with syringe # and ABG PO 2 values  (redcap.wustl.edu )

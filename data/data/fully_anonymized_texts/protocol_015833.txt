Amendment 11 (21-Aug-2020 ) 
Amendment Rationale  
As of 17-Jul- 2020, [ADDRESS_620407] received study treatment in 8 countries; Part 1 dose 
escalation has enrolled 27 patients and is closed to enrollment. Part 2 has enrolled 58 pediatric 
patients, and is closed to enrollment. These 58 patients include: 28 patients with High Grade 
Glioma (HGG), 17 patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG), 11 patients with Langerhans Cell 
Histiocytosis (LCH) and 2 patients with other (miscellaneous)  solid tumors. [ADDRESS_620408] been previously 
aligned with EU and US regulatory agencies.   
Note that the trial has enrolled only four patients with miscellaneous tumor types (those that are 
BRAFV600 mutant but are not HGG, LGG, or LCH); two in the dose finding portion, two i n 
the dedicated miscellaneous cohort, over the more than 5 years of  enrollment. The miscellaneous cohort is not required for regulatory obligations, and is not required to meet the aims of the clinical trial.  Hence, the proposed enrollment target for the  miscellaneous cohort is 
modified from ‘at least 10 patients’ to ‘up to ten patients.’   
The protocol is also being amended to add updated RANO criteria specifically for low grade 
glioma (RANO -LGG; Wen 2017) as the basis for independent review. These more recent 
RANO- LGG criteria allow for the identification of measurable target lesions in patients with 
LGG that may not be gadolinium enhancing and are best seen by T2/FLAIR imaging sequences.  These updated RANO - LGG criteria will be utilized in supplementa l independent RANO 
response determination for those patients with LGG.  Note that the independent response determinations  that were  originally intended to be applied using the older RANO criteria will 
be retained for analysis purposes.   Also note that the  response category of ‘minor response’ 
will not be used in this trial.   
Changes in the protocol:  
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the 
protocol using strikethrough red font for deletions and red underline for insertions:

Amendment 10 (04-Apr-2019)  
Amendment Rationale  
As of 06- Feb-2019, [ADDRESS_620409] received study treatment in 8 countries; Part 1 dose 
escalation has enrolled 27 patients and is closed to enrollment. Based on the data from these 27 
subjects, no maximum tolerated dose was established in this pediatric population and the 
recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) for dabrafenib monotherapy were determined based on 
exposure target as 5.25 mg/kg/day for patients < 12 years old and 4.5 mg/kg/day for patients ≥ 12 years old, divided into two equal daily doses, and not to exceed adult dose. 
Part 2 has enrolled 58 pediatric patients, and is closed to enrollment. These 58 patients include: 28 patients with High Grade Glioma (HGG), 17 patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG), 11 patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) and [ADDRESS_620410] completed or discontinued study treatment. 
The purpose of this amendment is to add additional interim analyses of data to support  health 
authority requests. 
Changes in the protocol:  
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the 
protocol using strikethrough red font for deletions and red underline for insertions: 
• Section 5.3.2: Updated to include additional interim analyses to support health authority 
requests.  
• Section 7.1.1: Minor update to the language for female contraception to remove the term ‘hormonal methods’ from the sentence to clarify that oral contraceptives are not considered as  highly effective methods of contraception due to potential drug-drug 
interactions with dabrafenib.   
• Section 8.2: Table [ADDRESS_620411] of prohibited medications during study treatment. Based on the review of the literature, o xcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_482931] a strong CYP3A4 inducer, but more as a moderate inducer. Therefore, significant drug-drug interaction risk between oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_482932].  
• Section 14: Added two references to confirm that oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_235227] a strong CYP3A4 inducer.

mg/kg/day for subjects < 12 years old and 4.5 mg/kg/day for subjects ≥ 12 years old, divided 
into two equal daily doses, and not to exceed adult dose. 
Part 2 has enrolled 57 pediatric patients (27 patients with High Grade Glioma (HGG), 17 patients with Low Grade Glioma (LGG), 11 patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) and 2 patients with other solid tumors). Currently only the HGG and other solid tumor cohorts are open for enrollment in Part 2. [ADDRESS_620413] completed or discontinued

Amendment 8 (19- May-2017)  
Amendment rationale  
As of 04- May-[ADDRESS_620414] received study treatment in 7 countries; Part 1 dose escalation has enrolled 27 
subje cts and is closed to enrollment. Based on the data from these 27 subjects, no maximum 
tolerated dose was established in this pediatric population and the recommended Phase 2 doses 
(RP2Ds) for dabrafenib monotherapy were determined based on exposure target as 5.25

mg/kg/day for subjects < 12 years old and 4.5 mg/kg/day for subjects ≥ 12 years old, divided 
into two equal daily doses, and not to exceed adult dose. 
Part 2 has enrolled 51 subjects (21 pediatric High Grade Glioma (HGG), 17 pediatric Low Grade Gli oma (LGG), 11 Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) and 2 other solid tumor 
subjects). Currently only the HGG and other solid tumor cohorts are open for enrollment in Part 2. [ADDRESS_620415] 6 months of treatment or had discontinued treatment earlier. The interim analysis showed preliminary efficacy in overall response rate for subjects with HGG and LGG 
sufficient for further investigation. 
The main objective of this protocol amendment 8 is  
• To allow the enrollment of additional subjects in the HGG cohort of Part 2 of the study. 
This cohort was originally planned to include approximately 10 subjects and has enrolled 21 subjects in Part 2 to date. In view of the promising efficacy in this otherwise very poor prognosis disease, enrollment will remain open until another pediatric HGG study is open for enrollment of this population across all age groups in the same countries (expected by [CONTACT_5638] 2018 and no later than mid 2019). Enrollment into the LGG and LCH cohorts have not been extended as subjects may be able to enroll into another pediatric study (MEK116540).    
Additional changes were made as follow:  
• The safety monitoring and management sections were revised to distinguish the procedures that are recommended or mandatory and updated to align with the program standard language. The management of renal insufficiency section was clarified  to account 
for the young age population studied and their normal range.  
• The monitoring process of dermatologic lesions was modified to allow local assessment during non- clinic visits or dermatologic assessment only visits to accommodate subjects 
who have to travel from afar.  
• Collection of imaging scans from the most recent prior chemotherapy for subjects with LGG was added to explore the comparison of retrospective data with data collected while on treatment. Tumor shrinkage at a six month time-point of t reatment has been utilized as 
a surrogate for treatment effect in LGG, where durable stability or shrinkage is considered clinical benefit.  Performing a similar comparison in subjects with HGG would be more difficult due to the aggressive nature of the disease and the need to review the entire prior clinical course.   
• The table of time and events schedule was modified to align the assessments to decrease the frequency of visits after one year of treatment.  
• The data analysis and statistical consideration w as updated to align the analysis 
populations with the statistical analysis plan.  
• Two interim analyses were added to explain a past unplanned interim analysis and a future 
interim analysis for decision making of development options. 
• Independent review of HGG tumor histology was clarified in the protocol.  It has been 
shown that LGG can be misdiagnosed for HGG, so the independent review will ensure 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 7 
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
consistent application of the WHO glioma classification scale to allow for more reliable 
comparison to historica l studies. As a sensitivity analysis, the efficacy data will be 
analyzed including only subjects with centrally confirmed HGG. 
• Due to the possible harm to the fetus from dabrafenib exposure, male contraception requirement was added.  
• The permitted and prohi bited concomitant medication section was modified to permit 
immunization and to remove the need to be cautious with medicinal products that increase gastric pH due to the low drug-drug interaction risk.  Co-administration of dabrafenib with the pH elevatin g agent rabeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) did not result in clinically 
meaningful changes to dabrafenib PK (study CDRB436A2103).  
• Editorial changes and text corrections were made for clarification, where required, and to align with [COMPANY_001] terminology procedures and format.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Dabrafenib ([COMPANY_004]2118436) is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity with a 
mechanism of action consistent with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibition. 
Dabrafenib has demonstrated suppression of a downstream pharmacodynamic biomarker (phosphorylated extracellular signal -related  kinase [pERK]) in tumor cell lines, demonstrated 
anti-proliferative activity against multiple BRAF mutation -positive tumor cell lines, achieved 
proximal biomarker suppression and tumor regression in BRAF mutant xenograft models, and has demonstrated signi ficant anti -tumor efficacy in BRAF V600- mutation positive tumors, 
including melanoma, papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686], and non- small cell lung cancer. Dabrafenib is 
currently approved in many jurisdictions for adult subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advan ced or metastatic melanoma, and is being studied in subjects with other BRAF V600 
mutation -positive tumor types. 
As of May, 2012, there were [ADDRESS_620433] -Time -in-Human 
(FTIH) study (BRF112680), a food effect/particle size evaluation study (BRF113468) with 2 different capsule shells (gelatin and hydroxylpropylmethyl cellulose [HPMC]), a human mass balance study (BRF113463), and a microdose absolute bioavailability study (BRF113479), and 1 ongoing clinical pharmacology study, a repeat dose, drug- drug interaction study 
(BRF113771).  There were  ongoing Phase II studies (BRF113710 in subjects with metastatic 
melanoma, BRF113928 in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] and BRF113929 in subjects with  metastatic melanoma to the brain), and one ongoing Phase III study 
(BRF113683) in advanced or metastatic melanoma.  Three pediatric subjects were given 
dabrafenib on a compassionate use basis.  There is an ongoing Phase I/II combination study 
with trametinib ([COMPANY_004]1120212), a MEK inhibitor (BRF113220).  A separate rollover protocol is available for subjects still benefitting from treatment at the end of the Phase I, II or III studies.  
Complete safety, clinical activity and pharmacokinetic (PK) data for clinical and non- clinical 
studies conducted with dabrafenib are provided in the Investigator Brochure (IB).  A summary of safety, clinical activity and PK data are also provided below. Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for the most up to date safety and efficacy data.   
1.1.1  Summary of Safety Data (All Studies) and Available Clinical Activity Data (BRF112680 and BRF113710)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  BRF112680 (FTIH)  
As of [ADDRESS_620434] one dose of dabrafenib.  As of 19 March 2012 all subjects were discontinued from the study.  One hundred and eighty- two 
(99%) subjects experienced an adverse event (AE) of any grade. The most common (>20% of all subjects) AEs of any grade across all dosing cohorts in Part 1 and Part 2 were fatigue ( 42%), 
pyrexia (37%), headache (35%), nausea (34%), hyperkeratosis (33%), diarrhoea (27%), arthralgia (25%), pain in extremity (25%), decreased appetite (24%), alopecia (23%) and rash (23%).  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 39% of subjects.  SAEs occurring in 3% or more subjects were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (12%), pyrexia (7%), and urinary tract infection (3%).  Sixty four subjects are reported to have had study drug interrupted due to 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 22  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
the occurrence of AEs.  Pyrexia was the most common AE leading to a dose interruption.  
Fifteen subjects reported a dose reduction due to the occurrence of [ADDRESS_620435] one dose of dabrafenib.  
PK, pharmacodynamic and clinical activity results supported 1) the conclusion that the 
recommended clinical dose of dabrafenib in adult subjects is 150 mg twice daily (BID) and 2) the conclusion that dabrafenib has demonstrat ed significant efficacy in subjects with BRAF 
V600E or V600K mutant-positive advanced melanoma. 
An investigator -assessed best unconfirmed response rate of 67% was observed in subjects with 
BRAF V600E/K mutation- positive melanoma receiving the recommended dose of 150 mg BID 
(n=45). In addition, data from a small number of adult subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive 
solid tumors other than melanoma, who were enrolled in an expansion cohort in the FTIH study, suggested that dabrafenib may have beneficial effects in these subjects as well [BRF112680].  There were 7 subjects enrolled with colorectal cancer (CRC), [ADDRESS_620436] was enrolled in Part 2 (150 mg BID) and reported an unconfirmed partial response (PR) at [ADDRESS_620437] was enrolled in Part 1 (100 mg BID) and reported stable disease before progressing at approximately 36 weeks.

[IP_ADDRESS]  BRF113710 (Phase II in Metastatic Melanoma)  
As of 20 February 2012, 92 subjects were enrolled in BRF113710 and 87 (95%) of subjects 
experienced at least one AE of any grade.  The majority of all AEs were Grade [ADDRESS_620438] commonly reported AEs (>20% of subjects) were arthralgia (33%), hyperkeratosis (28%), pyrexia (27%), fatigue (23%), headache (23%) and nausea (21%).  SAEs were reported in 29 (32%) subjects.  SAEs occurring in 3% or more subjects were cutaneous SC C (9%), basal cell 
carcinoma (4%), anemia (3%), pyrexia (3%) and vomiting (3%).  Twenty- nine subjects (32%) 
had study drug interrupted and 16 (17%) subjects required dose reduction due to the occurrence of AEs.  One adverse event (pancytopenia, unrelated to dabrafenib) resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug.  No fatal Grade 5 SAEs were reported in the study. 
The primary objective of this study was achieved with an overall investigator -assessed 
confirmed response rate in the BRAF V600E Population of 59% (95% CI:  48.2-70.3%), 
including a 7% complete response rate.  Additionally, 16% of subjects in the BRAF V600E Population experienced stable disease for a minimum of 12 weeks.  Two subjects (13%) in the BRAF V600K Population had a confirmed respon se (95% CI:  0-28.7%).  Seven subjects (44%) 
in the BRAF V600K Population had SD for a minimum of 12 weeks and 5 subjects (31%) had PD as a best response.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  BRF113683 (Phase III in Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma)  
As of 19 December 2011, 187 (75%) subjects randomized to dabrafenib and 59 (25%) subjects randomized to dacarbazine (DTIC) and received at least one dose of study treatment.  The majority of subjects in both treatment arms (99% in the dabrafenib arm and 92% in the DTIC arm) experienced at least 1 AE.   Grade 3 AEs were reported at a similar frequency in both arms 
(dabrafenib: 29%; DTIC: 27%) and Grade 4 AEs were more frequently experienced by 14% of subjects in the DTIC arm compared to the 4% of subjects in the dabrafenib arm.  The most 
common ( ≥20% of  subjects) AEs of any grade reported in the dabrafenib arm were 
hyperkeratosis (37%), headache (32%), pyrexia (28%), arthralgia (27%), skin papi[INVESTIGATOR_81875] (24%), 
alopecia (22%) and palmar -plantar erythrodysaethesia (PPE) syndrome (20%).  Each of these 
events was reported in a greater proportion of subjects in the dabrafenib arm than in the DTIC arm.  AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_482939] (GI) symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and cytopenias (including neutropenia , anemia 
and thrombocytopenia) were more common in the DTIC arm than in the dabrafenib arm.  Fatigue and asthenia were common (≥15%) in both arms of the study.   
A similar proportion of subjects experienced SAEs in both treatment groups (dabrafenib: 43 [23%] subjects; DTIC 13 [22%] subjects).  SAEs reported in more than 1% of the dabrafenib 
arm were cutaneous SCC (5%); reported under the preferred terms of squamous cell carcinoma [4%] and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin [2%]), pyrexia (4%) and malignant  melanoma 
(2%).  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 24  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
The same proportion of subjects (27%) experienced AEs resulting in dose interruptions/delays 
in the 2 treatment arms.  The AEs resulting in dose delays/interruptions in ≥ 2% of subjects in the dabrafenib arm were pyrexia (11%), PPE syndrome  (3%), chills (3%), alanine 
aminotransferase increased (2%), hyperkeratosis (2%) and in the DTIC arm the events were the known events for this compound.  During the randomized phase, AEs resulting in discontinuation of study treatment occurred in 3% of subjects in both treatment groups.  In the dabrafenib arm the following AEs caused a discontinuation: hepatic pain, constipation, mitral and tricuspid valve disease, muscular weakness and myocardial infarction. 
A similar proportion of subjects experienced AEs resulting in dose reductions (dabrafenib: 
18%; DTIC: 17%).  The AEs resulting in dose reductions in ≥2% of the subjects in the dabrafenib arm were pyrexia (9%), PPE syndrome (3%), chills (3%), fatigue (2%), and headache (2%).  
Twenty -one (11%) subjects in the dabrafenib arm and 9 (15%) subjects in the DTIC arm have 
died.  All but 1 death (elective euthanasia, dabrafenib arm) was attributed to the disease under study. 
Preliminary efficacy data from this study have now been published ( Hauschild, 2012). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  BRF113929 (Phase II, Metastatic Melanoma to the Brain)  
As of 28 November 2011, 172 subjects were enrolled into BRF113929 with 89 subjects in 
Cohort A (subjects with no prior local therapy for brain metastasis) and 83 subjects in Cohort B (subjects who received prior local therapy for brain metastasis).  Most subjects (92%) experienced at least one AE.  Most AEs experienced by [CONTACT_483009] [ADDRESS_620439] common AEs (experienced by ≥ 20% subjects) in both cohorts were 
headache (28%), hyperkeratosis (26%), nausea (26%), pyrexia (26%), fatigue (25%) and 
vomiting (20%). 
A total of 51 (30%) subjects experienced SAEs.  Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 68 (40%) 
subjects.   Headache, P PE syndrome, SCC, hypokalemia and hyponatremia were the most 
frequent Grade 3 AEs (3% each), while neutropenia at 2% was the most frequent Grade 4 AE.  
Fifty -five (32%) subjects had an AE leading to dose interruption.  Pyrexia was the most 
common AE leading to dose interruptions in the study (10%).  Other AEs that led to dose 
interruptions in at least 2 subjects in the study were vomiting, chills, hypotension, decreased appetite, and fatigue. 
Twenty -four (14%) subjects experienced AEs leading to dose reductions in the study; pyrexia 
(4%) and hypophosphatemia (2%) were the [ADDRESS_620440] common AEs leading to dose reductions. Few subjects (2%) discontinued study treatment due to AEs.  Two subjects in Cohort A and 1 
in Cohort B died as a result of cerebral hemorrhage unrelated to study treatment; according to the investigator, the primary cause of death for all [ADDRESS_620441] now been published ( Hauschild, 2012).

Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
dabrafenib [ADDRESS_620442] been characterized in multiple studies and compared to 
dabrafenib.  Based on the pre -clinical activity and systemic exposure of the metabolites relative 
to dabrafenib, hydroxy- and desmethyl -dabrafenib are thought to be likely to contribute to 
clinical activity while the carboxy -metabolite is predicted to be inactive.  
1.1.3  Pharmacodynamics  
Analyses of the relationship between dabrafenib exposure and efficacy endpoints were conducted with combined data from the FTIH (BRF112680), the Phase II (BRF113710), and Phase III (BRF113683) studies.  Different measures of exposure were evaluated including average dose, predicted average concentration of dabrafenib (Cavg), and predose concentrations of hydroxy- , carboxy- and desmethyl -dabrafenib to assess contribution of 
metabolite(s) to the activity of dabrafenib.  Predose concentrations of dabrafenib (observed or predicted) were also evaluated.  Predicted concentrations were based on the population PK model. 
Objective response rate at first assessment (dabrafenib doses of 35 mg BID to 300 mg BID) or 
confirmed response (dabrafenib doses of 50 mg BID to 300 mg BID) from different studies were evaluated in the analysis. The probability (P) that the response was CR/PR, stable disease or PD was modeled using an ordered categorical logistic regression model. Across studies, higher exposure was as sociated with greater response rate, until the response rate reached a 
maximum value at dabrafenib Cavg of approximately 300 ng/mL.  Response rate data were related to dabrafenib Cavg using an Emax model with estimated EC50 (95% CI) values of 68.9 (14.9, 159) and 77.4 (21.4, 176) ng/mL, for first assessment and confirmed response, respectively.  
A model of tumor growth kinetics was developed based on the sum of longest diameter over time to demonstrate the effect of dabrafenib on tumor growth.  A total of 392 subjects who received dabrafenib and 58 subjects who received dacarbazine (DTIC) were included in the analysis.  The tumor size model was able to characterize baseline tumor size (BSL), tumor growth dynamics with exponential growth (K
L), dabrafenib drug effect on tumor growth (K D) 
and drug resistance/disease progression ( λ).  Consistent with the analysis of objective response, 
dabrafenib Cavg was a significant predictor of changes in tumor size.  Drug effect was 
significant on the parameter describing dis ease progression/resistance ( λ) using a linear model, 
with subjects with higher dabrafenib Cavg having longer duration of response (lower value of 
λ) than those with lower exposures. 
Administration of dabrafenib 150 mg BID (gelatin) resulted in inhibition (>80%) of tumor 
phosphorylated extracellular signal -related kinase (pERK), a downstream biomarker of the 
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway that has been shown to be associated with clinical response in BRAF mutant tumor models ( Bollag, 2010). 
1.1.4  Relative Bioavailability of Dabrafenib Administered as HPMC versus Suspension and dispersible tablet  
Dabrafenib was administered as a suspension to 4 subjects with BRAF mutation positive tumors in a Phase I study (Study BRF113463) to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of dabrafenib.  Administration of dabrafenib as a suspension resulted in faster 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 27  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
absorption (tmax 1 hr), higher Cmax, but similar overall exposure relative to administration of 
HPMC  capsules.  Based on cross -study comparisons, the bioavailability of dabrafenib as the 
suspension is approximately 85% relative to administration as HPMC capsules. 
Treatment with dabrafenib dispersible tablets resulted in a decrease of AUC and Cmax by 20% 
and 49%, respectively relative to administration of HPMC dabrafenib capsules. Tmax was comparable between the two formulations. This difference in AUC is not considered clinically relevant based on the exposure -response relationship in adult melanoma and therefore no dose 
adjustment will be made for the dispersible tablets in this study. Cmax is not associated with response. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_620443] been positively identified in 50% of pediatric patients with malignant melanoma ( Daniotti, 2009) , 57% of patients with Lange rhans 
cell histiocyto sis (LCH) (Badalian -Very, 2010) , and >10% of patients with certain types of 
gliomas (both low - and high- grade tumors) ( Dougherty, 2010; MacConaill, 2009; Schiffman, 
2010) .  As more childhood tumors are analyzed for the presence of relevant DNA mutations, 
other tumor types with BRAF mutations are likely to be identified.  Given that non- melanoma 
BRAF V600 mutant tumors have been shown to be responsive to treatment with dabrafenib, 
strong rationale exists for exploring the activity of dabrafenib in BRAF V600 mutant pediatric tumors.  A brief overview of pediatric tumors with known BRAF V600 activating mutations is provided below. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant Melanoma  
Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers.  In Europe, 67,400 
incident melanoma cases occur each year, which accounts for app roximately 2.7% of all cancers 
(Ferlay, 2010).  The overwhelming majority of these cases occur in adult patients. 
Malignant melanoma is extremely rare in children <12 years of age, but does occur among adolescents aged 12 -18 years, with approximately 271 new melanoma ca ses were expected to 
occur during 2010 in the European Union (EU), with the most cases in [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) (n=62), [LOCATION_013] (n=54) and [LOCATION_009] (n=47) ( WE[LOCATION_006]BRE5092, 2010) based on an estimation 
made using the incidence rates from the Automated Childhood Cancer Information System (ACCIS) (deVries, 2006) applied to age -specific 2010 m id-year population projections ( United 
Nations, 2010) using an incidence rates across Europe range from 0.04- 0.14 per 100,000 for 
children (0-14 years) and 0.63-1.87 per 100,000 for adolescents (15-19 years) ( deVries, 2006).  
In the [LOCATION_002] (US), the numbers of incident cases were 206 for Stage I, 22 for Stage II, 35 for Stage III and 5  for Stage IV, based on the Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] 
(SEER) stage d istribution for 0-19 year olds ( SEER, 2010). 
Histo pathologically, adult and pediatric melanomas appear to be similar.  According to the 
scientific literature, approximately 50% of cases of pediatric melanoma may involve BRAF V600E mutations, which is a proportion similar to that observed in adults ( Daniotti, 2009).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)  
LCH is a rare proliferative disorder of unknown etiology that primarily affects children.  It is 
distinguished by [CONTACT_483010].  Langerhans cells are bone -marrow derived dendritic cells, 
characterized by [CONTACT_20376]1a, S100 and the production of Birbeck granules.  The pathogenesis of LCH is poorly understood.  Clinical  manifestations are related to the pattern of 
infiltration o r organ involvement ( Stockschlaeder, 2006; Arico, 1998) .  The clinical 
presentation is heterogeneous, can involve single or multiple organs, and can be associated with varying, often unpredictable outcomes ranging from spontaneous regression to multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_482940], long term debilitating sequelae, rapid progression, and death.  
Patients with localized (s ingle system) disease in ‘low risk’ organs typi[INVESTIGATOR_482941] (for example, isolated bone lesion).  On the other 
hand, multisystem disease, especially disease involving key ‘high risk’ organs (hematopoietic, spleen, liver, lung), carries higher risk of poor outcomes and recurrent events (reactivation 
disease) after initial therapy.  
LCH occurs at an estimated rate of 2 to 10 per million children/adolescents under the age of 15 
years ( National Cancer Institute (NCI), 2012; Stalemark, 2008), as compared to approximately 
1 to 2 cases per million in adults.  Approximately 76% of cases occur in children less than 10 years old.  Risk of morbidity and mortality increases substanti ally when multifocal or multi-
organ disease is present ( Satter, 2008). 
In a recent report, which is also the first to show activation of any oncogenic signalling pathway in LCH, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in nearly 60% of a cohort of archival lesion samples obtained from children and adults with LCH ( Badalian -Very, 2010 ).  The identification 
of BRAF V600E mutations in LCH has been confirmed in a recently published second report (Satoh, 2012). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Low-Grade and High- Grade Gliomas  
As compared to adults, where primary brain tumors represent only 1- 2% of new cases of cancer 
in adult, central nervous system (CNS) tumors comprise approximately 25% of all pediatric cancers, and are second only to leukemia in terms of incidence.  Among children in the US, the overall incidence rate for 2004- 2006 for malignant primary brain and CNS tumors was 3.2 cases 
per 100,000 person -years for children 0 -19 years of age ( CBTRUS, 2010) .  Approximately 50% 
of all CNS tumors are astrocytoma s, most of which are low -grade ( Qaddoumi, 2009; 
Dougherty, 2010) .  Specific low -grade tumor types include ganglioglioma, diffuse astrocytoma, 
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, pi[INVESTIGATOR_153471], and pi[INVESTIGATOR_184567]. Glioma 
accounts for 71% of malignant CNS tumors among those aged 0- 14 years and accounts for 74 % 
among those aged 15- 19 years ( CBTRUS, 2010) , resulting in an incidence of approximately 
2.3 cases per 100,000 person- years. The annual incidence of low -grade gliomas (LGGs) in 
general is approximately [ADDRESS_620444] frequently occurring, accounting for approximately 20%  of 
all pediatric brain tumors ( Dougherty, 2010) .  The incidence of pi[INVESTIGATOR_482942] 10 times that in adults (0.5 per million in adults versus 8.3 per million in children).  Conversely, high- grade gliomas (HGGs) are less common in children than adults, 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 29  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
comprising <10% of all pediatric CNS tumors.  Similar rates have been reported for [LOCATION_006] and 
Great Britain ( Cancer Research [LOCATION_006], 2010 ).  Examples of HGGs are glioblastoma multiforme 
and anaplastic astrocytoma.  
BRAF V600E point mutations have been reported to occur in several low - and high- grade tumor 
types in pediatric patients, including approxim ately 50- 60% of gangliogliomas ( MacConaill, 
2009; Dougherty, 2010) , approximately 2- 12% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_422860] ( Forshew, 2009; 
Pfister, 2008; MacConaill, 2009; Qaddoumi, 2009 ; Jacob, 2009; Dias-Santagata, 2011), and in 
as many as 30% of high- grade astrocytomas ( Schiffman, 2010; Basto, 2005) .  While there is 
only limited evidence, it appears that the frequency of BRAF activating mutations may be more 
common in pediatric astrocytomas than in adult tumors ( Knobbe, 2004 ).  This is consistent with 
observations that while grade [ADDRESS_620445] from that seen in pediatric astrocytomas ( Schiffman, 2010). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Papi[INVESTIGATOR_482943] (PTC)  
Thyroid nodules are rare in childhood and adolescence, with a general prevalence of less than 2%; however, they are more frequently malignant than in adults (approximately 20% of cases) (Corrias, 2010) .  Thyroid carcinomas have an average incidence of approximately 5 per million 
in patients under the age of 20 years ( NCI, 2012 ).  Incidence typi[INVESTIGATOR_482944]-frame, such that the m ajority of cases are observed in adolescents 15 to 19 years old 
(approximately 15 per million) ( NCI, 2012) .  PTC currently comprises appr oximately 70% of 
all diagnoses ( NCI, 2012 ). 
Pediatric PTC usually presents at an advanced stage, but still has excellent prognosis, with a 5 -
year survival rate of >99% ( NCI, 2012) .  At presentation, 70% of patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_482945], and 10% to 20% may have distant metastasis, with the most common site  of metastases being the lungs ( Alessandri, 2000) .  Conditions known to increase 
risk of childhood PTC are elevated plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration, Hashimoto’s disease, exposure to radiation, and mutations in RET-oncogene. 
BRAF V600E mutations are common in adult PTC, reported at a rate of approximately 50% 
(Nikiforova, 2009; Melck, 2010) .  In pediatric PTC, the proportion of BRAF V600E -positive 
tumors appears to be slightly lower.  In recent publications, BRAF V600E mutations were identified in approximately 20% of ca ses in patients aged <20 years ( Rosenbaum, 2005;  
Kumagai, 2004).  
1.2 Rationale 
1.2.1  Study Rationale  
The proposed study is a Phase I/IIa, open- label study to determine the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of oral dabrafenib in pediatric and adolescent subjects aged ≥[ADDRESS_620446]- line cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], even in dose -intensive regimens, has 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 30  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
yet to yield significant impact on progression- free survival or overall survival.  Recent data 
identifying BRAF V600 activating mutations in pediatric melanoma, gliomas, LCH, and PTC 
coupled with the recent development of specific BRAF inhibitors may allow for the development of a new therapeutic opportunity for children, and is the primary rationale for this study. 
In addition, BRAF inhibitors such as dabrafenib have a substantially different safety profile 
than cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy, both of which are employed in standard 
of care regimens for advanced pediatric solid tumors.  Moreover, radiation and cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482946]- term effects on the health and developmen t (both physical 
and cognitive) of children.  The Childhood Cancer Survivors Study, a large cohort study conducted in the [LOCATION_002], found that greater than 40% of survivors of pediatric cancers are burdened with long- term adverse health effects ( Hudson, 2002) . Specifically, the individual 
components of current therapy for solid tumors lead to both short and long term morbidities.  Surgical resection can lead to loss of function or disfigurement, or in the case of CNS tumors, long term neurologic and cognitive sequelae.  Cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, especially when administered in dose - or time -intensive manners, can lead to neutropenia and increased risk of 
infection, sepsis, and death, cardiac dysfunction (doxorubicin), infertility (cyclophosphamide), renal injury and hearing loss (cisplatin).  In addition, many of these cytotoxic agents, in particular, DNA alkylating agents and epi[INVESTIGATOR_436399], have long been known to predispose patients to treatment- associated leukemias ( Hawkins, 1992) .  Radiotherapy can also 
have profound effects on skeletal growth and, for patients with CNS tumors, on endocrine function, cognition, vasculopathy and risk of second tumors.  New target ed therapeutics such 
as dabrafenib may offer a way of reducing the need for cytotoxics, or may offer a means by [CONTACT_483011], thereby [CONTACT_483012] -associated 
morbidity and mortality.  
Given the similarity between adult and pediatric melanoma, data from this study will be used 
to support a bridging approach to demonstrate that the PK, and (where available) pharmacodynamic and efficacy data in adolescent subjects are similar to that of adults, using a modelling and simulation approach. 
In summary, it is thought that dabrafenib has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to those 
pediatric patients with advanced solid tumors with BRAF V600 activating mutations.  Due to the scarcity of BRAF mutation positive tumors  in children, and the anticipated favourable safety 
profile of dabrafenib in children (based on adult data), enrolment of different pediatric age groups will not be staggered.   
1.2.2  Dose Rationale  
A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not established in adults for dabrafenib in Study 
BRF112680.  However, relationships between the total daily dabrafenib dose and markers of clinical benefit (reduction in FDG -PET uptake and tumor shrinkage) were determined and the 
PK, safety, pharmacodynamic and efficacy data were us ed to identify a recommended Phase II 
dose of 150mg BID.  As such, in this pediatric study, dabrafenib dose escalation will proceed to the target geometric mean steady -state plasma exposure observed in adults given the 
efficacious Phase III dose of dabrafenib 150 mg BID as HPMC capsules.  It is not anticipated 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 31  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
that a true MTD will be identified given the low incidence of dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
seen in the adult clinical development of dabrafenib. 
The rationale for this pharmacokinetically -based dos e-escalation approach is based on the 
likelihood that therapeutic benefit in children will be achieved by [CONTACT_483013], principally steady- state AUC(0 -τ) following 150 mg BID dabrafenib as HPMC 
capsules.  The geometric mean (95% CI) dabrafenib AUC(0 -τ) after administration of 150 mg 
BID as the HPMC capsule in the Phase III study (BRF113683) was 4341 (3749, 5485) 
ng*h/mL.  These Phase III data were consistent with the preliminary results from the monotherapy arm of study BRF113220 where geometric mean dabrafenib AUC(0 -τ) after 
administration of 150 mg BID as the HPMC capsule was 4648 ng*h/mL.  Therefore, the median population target AUC(0- τ) for pediatric subjects will be approximately 4500 ng*h/mL, with 
the goal of identifying, where possible, a dose for each age groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (12- 18, 6- 12, 2- 6, and less 
than 2 years of age) that results in a median dabrafenib AUC(0- τ) that is within the 95% CI for 
the geometric mean exposure measured in adults in the Phase III study (3749, 5485 ng*h/mL). 
The dabrafenib dose selection will be weight -based according to regulatory guidances 
(European Medicines Agency, 2006; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2000) .  The 
recomm ended adult dose of dabrafenib is 150 mg BID.  This dose corresponds to a 3.75 mg/kg 
total daily dose in an 80 kg adult.  The starting dose in Part  1 will be 3 mg/kg total daily dose, 
approximately 80% of the adult dose adjusted for body weight.  Dose esca lation in Part 1 will 
occur in a stepwise manner until the median AUC(0 -τ) is greater than approximately 4000 
ng*h/mL and does not exceed approximately 5500 ng*h/mL.  Dose escalation in Part 1 also 
will be influenced by [CONTACT_371627] -time analysis of the safety  and other available data obtained 
during the study. 
Based on clinical pharmacology considerations in the pediatric population, the selection of 
suitable dabrafenib doses for ages 2 to <18 years is not expected to be significantly complicated by [CONTACT_483014].  However, given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_482947], distribution, metabolism, and excretion processes in children <[ADDRESS_620447] of the physiology of infants on dabrafenib exposure.  As noted above, since a MT D of 
dabrafenib was not established in adult subjects with cancer, it is expected that dose -limiting 
toxicities also will be rare in children.  Therefore, a starting dose of 80% of the weight -based 
dose in adults will provide an adequate safety margin for infants.  The total daily dose administered in this study will not exceed 300 mg (150 mg BID).  
1.3 Summary of Risk Management 
The assessment of the risk of dabrafenib, and suggestions for management of risk, is based on non-clinical data and clinical data from  an integrated safety population of 578 adult subjects 
with melanoma receiving 150 mg dabrafenib BID. 
Dermatological effects :  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_85783] (acanthosis) and hyperkeratosis of the skin was 
seen in dogs and in rats. In clinical studies hyperkeratosis (29%), skin lesions including actinic 
keratosis (7%) and seborrhoeic keratosis (7%), palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia (PP E) 
syndrome (13%), rash (18%) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cuSCC) including keratoacanthomas (KA) (9%) have been observed.  Most events were Grade 1 with the exception of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, which were predominantly Grade 3. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 32  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
Derm atological changes are being monitored in subjects through interim medical history, 
assessment of adverse events and physical examination including examination of the skin. 
Guidelines on management of hand foot skin reactions (HFSR)/ PPE syndrome and skin rashes have been provided, with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482948], version 4.0 (NCI CTCAEv4.0 or higher) NCI -
CTCAE Grade 2 or Grade 3 HFSR toxicity.  Treatment of SCC, KA and keratotic  lesions should 
occur based upon institutional practice.  Dose interruptions or modifications are usually not required for SCC/KA.  
Ophthalmology effects :  Eye effects including blurred vision (2%), uveitis/iritis (<1%), eye 
pain (<1%), visual impairment (<1%) and reduced visual acuity (<1%) have been observed in clinical studies to date, with all events Grade 1 or 2.  An ophthalmologic consult is required for subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_482949], eye pain or erythema.  
Pyrexia :  In clinical studies, pyrexia was one of the most frequently occurring AEs (27%), most 
of which (64%) were considered to be related to study treatment.  Events were primarily Grade 1 (55%) or Grade 2 (39%) in severity.  The majority of events occurred early during study treatment, with a median time to onset of [ADDRESS_620448] cases (74% of 
first occurrences) were of short duration ( ≤5 days).  The majority of subjects with pyrexia were 
managed without dose interruption or dose reduction. Across dabrafenib studies, all SAEs of pyrexia, influenza -like illness, cytokine release syndrome, and systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome underwent clinical review for the identification of serious non- infectious febrile 
events, with complications of severe rigors, hypotension, dehydration, or renal failure in the absence of another identifiable etiology (i.e., infection).  Subjects should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection and work up considered as clinically indicated.  Dabrafenib must be held for fever of 38.5C or higher, and blood samples for an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and serum creatinine must be drawn in the setting of fever.  Subjects with fever should have a medical evaluation including measurement of blood press ure.  Cases of fever with severe rigors 
or fever with hypotension should be reported as SAEs (regardless of whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124889]). 
Acute Renal Failure:   Acute renal failure/renal failure has been rarely reported (<1%) in 
subjects rec eiving dabrafenib, and a case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis has also been 
reported in a clinical trial.   In some cases complicated pyrexia may be associated with renal 
insufficiency/renal failure, possibly secondary to dehydration or hypotension.  Renal function 
should be monitored carefully, especially in subjects with pyrexia.  Dabrafenib should be 
interrupted in subjects with significantly elevated serum creatinine (creatinine rise >0.5 mg/dL [44 µmol/L] above baseline or creatinine >2.0 mg/dL [177 µmol/L]).   
In juvenile rat studies, dose -dependent effects on kidney (tubular deposits with secondary 
changes, increased incidence of cortical cysts and tubular basophilia, tubular dilation and 
reversible increases in serum urea and/or creatinine concentrations) were observed.  Renal toxicity has not been observed in adult rats, dogs or mice given dabrafenib for up to [ADDRESS_620449]- weaning (postnatal day 22), there was no progression in the severity of renal findings nor

Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
were there any secondary changes. The observation of greater renal toxicity in rats < 22 days 
old suggests a higher risk for tubular injury for human infants <1 years of age based on 
comparison of renal maturation rates, and a correspondingly lower risk for patients between 1 and 4 years of age. 
Pancreatitis:  Pancreatitis (<1%) and/or increased lipase/amylase (2%) have been reported at a 
low frequency with dabrafenib, typi[INVESTIGATOR_117384] [ADDRESS_620450] be 
monitored locally. 
Hypersensitivity:   There has been a report of hypersensitivity (blisters), occurring on the same 
day as the first dose of study drug as well as upon rechallenge.  Grade 1 AEs of blisters on limbs 
(4 subjects) and drug hypersensitivity (rash, [ADDRESS_620451]) have been reported in previous studies with dabrafenib. However, the precise etiology of these events is unclear. 
Embryofetal Development and Reproductive Effects :  In embryofeta l development studies 
in rats, developmental toxicities including reduced fetal body weight, embryo- lethality, cardiac 
ventricular septal defect malformations, delayed skeletal development and variation in thymic 
shape have been observed. Dabrafenib must not be administrated to pregnant women or nursing mothers.  Female subjects of childbearing potential are required to use effective methods of contraception from the time of a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_620452] dose of study medication. In dogs and in rats, testicular degeneration/depletion has been observed in repeat dose studies (up to 13 weeks duration) with no clear evidence of recovery following off -treatment periods of up to 4 weeks 
duration.  Spermatid retention was observed in mice in a 14 day study. Male subjects enrolled or in follow -up in clinical trials are informed of the potential risk for impaired spermatogenesis, 
which may be irreversible.  
Cardiovascular effects : Data from preclinical studies with dabrafenib suggest the potential for 
cardiovascular effects, including cardiac valve effects in the 28 day dog study, coronary vascular effects in the 7 day dog study, hepatic vascular effects in a 10 day rat study, increased incidence of minimal cardiomyopathy in male rats and mild increases in heart rate in single dose studies in dogs and rats. In a 13- week oral toxicity study in dogs right atrial wall thickening 
characterized microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_58015] f ibrovascular proliferation (transmural granulation tissue) was 
observed. In the ongoing monotherapy clinical studies, 3 (<1%) non- serious valvular 
abnormalities meeting stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482950]; two of these subjects had baseline valv ular abnormalities Additionally,  a blinded independent review of available 
echocardiogram results from subjects participating in the phase [ADDRESS_620453] for dabrafenib.  Subjects with clinically significant baseline cardiac abnormalities are excluded from the study.  Safety evaluations include physical examination, 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) monitoring as 
well as AE reporting.

Respi[INVESTIGATOR_482951] :  Lobar bronchoalveolar inflammation has been observed in dogs, with 
shallow and/or labored breathing noted during the treatment phase in [ADDRESS_620454] been no corresponding clinical findings identified in clinical trials to date.

3.1 Study Design/Schematic 
This is a 2 -part, Phase I/IIa, multi-center, open label, study in pediatric subjects with advanced 
BRAF V600 mutation- positive solid tumors ( Figure 3 -1).  Subjects will participate in only 1 
part.  Part 1 will be a dose escalation study in subjects with any BRAF V600 mutation-positive

specific pediatric populations.  Approximately 6 to 18 subjects are estimated  for Part 1, and 
approxima tely 65 subjects are planned for Part 2 (at least 10 evaluable subjects in each of 
4 cohorts; evaluable for the purpose of clinical activity analysis is defined as a subject with a 
pre-dose and at least [ADDRESS_620455] -dose disease assessment). The HGG cohort will continue 
recruitment until enrollment on another pediatric HGG study is available (expected by [CONTACT_5638] 2018 and no later than mid 2019).

The screening visit will be completed within [ADDRESS_620456] dose of 
study medication.  No study specific procedure will start before the signature [CONTACT_56534] (and assent, according to institutional guidelines).  Screening assessments may be carried out over more than one day provided that all required assessments are completed within [ADDRESS_620457] dose of study drug.  Screening assessments may be repeated once at the discretion of the investigator. 
Safety and PK assessments will be performed at regular intervals as outlined in the Time and 
Events Tables ( Table 3 -7 and Table 3 -9).  Overall response will be assessed at regular intervals 
as outlined in the Time and Events Tables according to the appropriate guidelines as determined by [CONTACT_90050](s) under study (see Appendix 2).  Additional details for the conduct of Part 1 and 
Part 2 are provided in Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.2, respectively.  
Guidelines for dabrafenib dose modifications are outlined in Section 3.7.  Dabrafenib treatment may be delayed for up to 7 days to allow for resolution of toxicity.  For treatment delays >7 days due to toxicity, subjects should be withdrawn from dabrafenib permanently (unless the investigator determines that clinical benefit from continued administration of dabrafenib outweighs any risks associated with continued use). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety 
concerns.  Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for study conduct.

mg/kg given as 2 divided doses.  
c. The total daily dose will be split evenly into a morning and evening dose (BID dosing).  The total daily dose will not 
exceed 300 mg (150 mg BID).  
The actual weight- adjusted dose to be administered for a given dose level may be adjusted based 
on safety, tolerability and preliminary PK data at previous dose levels; these dose adjustments 
may involve either an increase or a decrease in the planned dose for a given dose level.  Dosing frequency may also be adjusted based on emerging PK and/or safety data.  Cohorts may be added in order to evaluate additional dose levels.  The study procedures for these additional subject(s) or cohort(s) will be the same as those described for other study subjects. 
Up to [ADDRESS_620459] experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT, see Section 3.3) at the current dose level, and the number of subjects enrolled but with data pending at the current dose level.  Dose escalation schematic is in Appendix 1. 
For example, if [ADDRESS_620460] 28  days (including Day 15 PK) and no DLTs were observed, a fourth subject can 
be enrolled at the next higher dose level (i.e., dose escalation ).  If all [ADDRESS_620461] will be enrolled at the next 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 37  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
lower dose level (i.e., de -escalated ).  Similarly, the process is repeated for the fifth and sixth 
subjects in a cohort. 
Beyond the sixth subject in an ongoing cohort, additional subjects wanting to be enrolled bef ore 
the next cohort is open for enrollment, can be enrolled at the previous lower dose level. 
On Day 1, serial blood samples for PK analysis will be collected in subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_620462] dose of dabrafenib.  A second dose may be administered on Day 1 if the timing is 
in compliance with Section 3.6.  Twice a day dosing will begin on Day 2.  PK samples in 
subjects ≥10 kg in weight will also be collected on Day 15.  For subjects <10 kg in weight, 
blood samples for PK analysis will be collected after repeated administration on Day 15 only. 
Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected throughout the study, and safety, 
tolerability and clinical activity assessments will be conducted according to th e Time and 
Events Tables ( Section  3.8).  
Treatment with dabrafenib will be continued until disease progression, until the subject is no longer obtaining clinical benefit from continued treatment, they develop an unacceptable toxicity, the study is terminated, or the subject withdraws consent or begins a new therapy.  At the end of treatment, a final study visit will occur.  Additional details on subject completion  are 
provided in Section  9.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation  
Dose escalation decisions will take into account all available safety and PK data (from the current and all previous cohorts, if available) and will be documented. 
If a subject is withdrawn before the first [ADDRESS_620463] enrolls in the study.  
The dose in Part 1 will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached (based on toxicity, Section 3.4) OR in the absence of reaching the MTD, the dose in which the median 
AUC(0 -τ) is between approximately 4000 ng*h/mL and approximately 5500 ng*h/mL. The 
proportion of subjects who achieve an AUC(0- 12) ≥ 4000 ng*h/mL also will be considered 
when selecting the dose for Part 2. In the absence of meeting criteria for MTD, if less than 80% of subjects in an age group (≤2 yrs, >2 and ≤12 yrs, >12 yrs) achieve an AUC(0 -12) ≥ 
approximately 4000 ng*h/mL OR if fewer than two subjects in a specific age group have been evaluated at a given dose level, the study sponsor and study team will review all available safety and PK data and determine if further Part 1 evaluation of a specific age group is required before these subjects may enroll in Part 2. Intermediate doses may be explored.

are <6 years of age.  
On Day 1, serial blood samples for PK analysis will be collected in subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_620466] dose of dabrafenib.  A second dose may be administered on D ay 1 if the timing is 
in compliance with Section 3.6.  Twice a day dosing will begin on Day 2.  PK samples in 
subjects ≥10 kg in weight will also be collected on Day 15.  For subjects <10 kg in weight, 
blood samples for PK analysis will be collected after repeated administration on Day 15 only. 
Blood samples for clinical laboratory tests will be collected throughout the study, and safety, 
tolerability and clinical activity assessments will be conducted according to the Time and Events Tables ( Section  3.8).  
Treatment with dabrafenib will be continued until disease progression, until the subject is no longer obtaining clinical benefit from continued treatment, they develop an unacceptable toxicity, the study is terminated, or the subject withdraws consent or begins a new therapy. At the end of treatment, a final study visit will occur.  Additional details on subject completion  are

open to enroll pediatric subjects.  For subjects entering the rollover study, data from the final study visit may be used for the transition visit into the rollover study. 
3.1.4  Follow -Up 
Follow- up care will be offered to subjects from Part 1 and Part 2.  Details are provided in Section 
9.4. 
3.2 Discussion of Study Design 
Dabrafenib is not being developed for BRAF V600 wild- type (non -mutation positive) tumors 
for several reasons: 1) dabrafenib has 10- fold less affinity for wild -type BRAF protein; 2) data 
from the FTIH study showed no evidence of anti -tumor activity in BRAF V600 wild -type 
subjects and no evidence of anti -tumor activity in BRAF non -V600 mutation positive subjects 
(e.g., K601 mutations) and 3) there is pre -clinical data to indicate that inhibition of wild -type 
RAF with BRAF inhibitors could lead to paradoxically enhanced signalling in cells with wild-
type BRAF via transactivation of dimerized RAF ( Poulikakos, 2010) .  This enhanced signalling 
could manifest as cell proliferation in BRAF wild -type tumors. 
Identification of BRAF V600 mutant pediatric tumors will be enabled by [CONTACT_483015][INVESTIGATOR_482952].  In addition, a 
central genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_482953] ([COMPANY_004]), with an external partner, for use in the adult dabrafenib program.  Because this central assay is DN A-
based, it can be employed for any tissue, including those from pediatric tumors.  Sites may enroll subjects based on genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_482954] a local (non- central) laboratory using a 
standardized assay performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendm ents (CLIA)-
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 39  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
approved (or equivalent) laboratory.  Sites without access to local laboratory testing may enroll 
subjects based on genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_482954] a central laboratory.  For enrolled subjects with available archived tissue, BRAF V600 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_6377] a lso be performed at a central 
laboratory. 
With regard to the dose escalation design, employing a modified RSD (as opposed to the 
commonly used 3+3 design) allows for more continuous accrual of subjects into the study and avoids delays in accruing and treating subjects with BRAF V600- mutant tumors as they are 
identified.  In the 3+[ADDRESS_620468] been evaluated for a specified evaluation period (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 28 days or more).  With the modified RSD, suspension of subject accru al occurs less frequently and therefore the enrolment period is shortened.  The 
ability to detect and respond to safety signals is the same in the modified RSD  as in the 3+3 
design ( Skolnik, 2008). 
Exposure-response relationships between plasma dabrafenib concentrations and clinical 
efficacy have been established in adult subjects with melanoma.  Given that the available published data indicates that the histopathology, molecular pathology of melanoma is similar betw een adolescent patients and adult patients, and that the molecular biology of mutant BRAF 
activity is identical between adult patients and patients in the pediatric population, it should be possible to extrapolate adult response data to adolescent patients, if the pharmacologic exposures achieved in adolescent patients are similar.  Also, no maximally tolerated dose has been identified in adult subjects with melanoma.  Therefore, in addition to monitoring for DLTs, systemic exposure to dabrafenib will be us ed to determine the optimal dose in the pediatric 
population.  
In the absence of compelling pre -clinical and clinical data to indicate a similar likelihood of 
response in pediatric BRAF V600 mutation- positive non- melanoma tumors to that seen in adult 
BRAF V600 mutation- positive melanoma, the introduction of new agents such as dabrafenib 
into pediatric oncology treatment regimens typi[INVESTIGATOR_482955].  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_482956], this study will be conducted in subjects who have expe rienced recurrent, 
refractory, or progressive disease after receiving at least [ADDRESS_620469] therapy.  One exception will be for subjects with metastatic melanoma (i.e., subjects with metastatic and surgically unresectable disease can be enrolled as first -line therapy) since there is sufficient clinical data 
from Phase III adult studies with dabrafenib to allow this treatment option. 
The study will use the currently available dabrafenib capsule strengths (50 mg and 75 mg) from 
the adult program for children who are able to reliably swallow capsules.  In addition, two lower strength capsules (10 mg and 25 mg),a powder for oral suspension formulation, and dispersible tablet formulation are available for pediatric subjects who may have difficulty swallowing larger  capsules. In [LOCATION_009], children younger than 6 years and children 6 years and older 
with a risk of choking when swallowing capsules are required to use the oral suspension formulation or dispersible tablet formulation.  
3.3 Dose Limiting Toxicity Definitions 
The DLT evaluable population is defined as those subjects in Part 1 fulfilling the ‘All Subjects’ 
population criteria and having received an adequate treatment in the first [ADDRESS_620470] 28 days 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 40  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
will be defined as having received >75% of planned study drug doses, exclusive of missed doses 
due to treatment -related toxicity.  For those subjects who are either withdrawn or dose reduced 
due to toxicity during the first [ADDRESS_620471] one of the following additional criteria:  
• Grade 4 hematologic AE (specifically neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia); 
• Grade [ADDRESS_620472] supportive measures.  Cutaneous SCC is not considered a DLT; 
• Treatment delay of greater than 7 consecutive days due to unresolved AE 
• Ejection fraction less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) with an absolute decrease of >10% from baseline with confirming assessment within 7 days; 
• A Grade 2 or greater non -hematological AE that in the judgment of the investigator and 
[COMPANY_001] Medical Lead is dose limiting;  
• AEs requiring a dose reduction. 
3.4 Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
An MTD has not been identified for dabrafenib in the adult population.  This does not preclude the identification of an MTD in the pediatric population.  As such, in the current study employing a modified RSD, if dose de -escalation  occurs (due to the occurrence of DL Ts) 
resulting in 6 subjects being entered at the next lower dose level, and there are ≤ 1 DLT in that 
next lower dose level (see Appendix 1), then the MTD will have been defined ( Skolnik, 2008) .  
3.[ADDRESS_620473] numbers can be found in the SPM. 
Treatment will not be randomized; nonetheless, each subject will be assigned a randomization number in accordance with the randomization schedule generated prior to the start of the study, using validated software.

meal resulted in an approximate 30% decrease in exposure and 50% decrease in Cmax compared to administration under fasting conditions. If it is not possible for a subject to tolerate the fasting conditions noted above, dabrafenib can be administere d with a small non -fat meal 
(e.g., small amount of apple juice/sauce, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_482959]). Subjects and their parents should be advised to avoid administering dabrafenib with milk or high-fat, high-calorie foods. 
If a subject vomits after taking study medication, the subject should be instructed not to retake 
the dose and should take the next scheduled dose. 
If a subject misses a dose, subject should not double the next regularly scheduled dose. 
However, subject can take the missed dose immediately if the  next scheduled dose is at least [ADDRESS_620477] should take the next dose at its usual time.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Pyrexia  
Pyrexia has been observed in adult subjects receiving dabrafenib. In a minority of cases pyrexia was accompanied by [CONTACT_483020]/rigors, dehydration, and hypotension, which in some cases can lead to acute renal in sufficiency.  Serious non- infectious febrile events 
have been observed and typi[INVESTIGATOR_482961]. 
Subjects should be instructed on the importance of immediately reporting febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Therapy with dabrafenib should be i nterrupted if the patient’s temperature is ≥38.5ºC or 101.3
○ 
Fahrenheit.  In the event of a fever, the subject should be instructed to take anti -pyretics (e.g. 
ibuprofen or acetaminophen/paracetamol as appropriate to control fever). The use of oral cortico steroids should be considered in those instances in which anti -pyretics are insufficient.  
In subjects experiencing pyrexia associated with rigors, severe chills, dehydration or hypotension, serum creatinine and other evidence of renal function (e.g. creat inine clearance, 
BUN) should be monitored carefully during and following severe events of pyrexia. Pyrexia 
accompanied by [CONTACT_27913], dehydration requiring intravenous fluids, renal insufficiency 
and/or severe (≥ Grade 3) rigors/chills in the absence of a n obvious infectious cause should be 
reported as a SAE.  
Guidelines regarding management and dose reduction for pyrexia considered to be related to dabrafenib are provided in Table 3 -4.

• Palmar Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPES) – Measures for PPES should include: 
• Lifestyle modification:  avoidance of hot water, traumatic activity, constrictive 
footwear, or excessive friction on the skin and the use of thick cotton socks and gloves, and shoes with padded insoles 
• Symptomatic treatments:  apply moisturizing creams frequently, topi[INVESTIGATOR_477365] (e.g. urea 20-40 % cream, salicylic acid 6%, tazarotene 0.1% cream, fluorouracil 5% cream), clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.05% ointment for erythematous areas, topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] 2%, and / or systemic pain medication such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, codeine, and pregabalin for pain. 
• Dose modification may also be required. 
• Pancreatitis – In the event of abdominal pain or suspected pa ncreatitis, amylase and 
lipase laboratory samples should be collected for confirmation of the diagnosis. Patients should be closely monitored when re-starting dabrafenib after an epi[INVESTIGATOR_28547] 
• Uveitis : Treatment with dabrafenib has been associated with the development of uveitis, 
including iritis. Monitor patients for visual signs and symptoms (such as, change in vision, photophobia and eye pain) during therapy. Permanently discontinue dabrafenib for 
persistent ≥ grade 2 uveitis (including iritis and iridocylitis) of > 6 week duration.  
• Hyperglycemia : Hyperglycemia requiring an increase in the dose of, or initiation of 
insulin or oral therapy can occur with dabrafenib. Monitor serum glucose levels as clinically appropriate during treatment with dabrafenib in subjects with pre-existing diabetes or hyperglycemia. Advise patients to report symptoms of severe hyperglycemia such as excessive thirst or any increase in the volume or frequency of urination.

Events Table.  Subjects who have an asymptomatic, absolute decrease of >10% in LVEF compared to baseline and the ejection fraction is below the institution’s LLN should 
temporarily discontinue dabrafenib and have a repeat evaluation of LVEF within 1 week.  ECHO should be repeated every 1- 2 weeks for 4 weeks or until LVEF recovery to above 
institutional lower limit of normal and within 10% of baseline.  
• If the LVEF recovers (defined as ≥ LLN and  absolute decrease ≤10% compared to 
baseline) at any time during the next [ADDRESS_620486] may be restarted on dabrafenib at a reduced dose(s).   For such 
subjects, monitoring of LVEF will then be performed 2 and 4 weeks after rechallenge, and every 4 weeks thereafter for 12 weeks and then per protocol.

probabilities, and the details are provided in Table 5 -1.  For example, if zero responses are 
observed among 10 subjects in a cohort [if the response rate (RR)=5%], the chance of declaring the cohort as having insufficient clinical activity after 10 subjects is 60%.  If the true RR=15% for dabrafenib in high grade glioma subjects, the chance declaring the cohort as having insufficient clinical activity after 10 subjects is approximately 20%.

The HGG cohort in Part 2 will continue recruitment after 10 subjects are enrolled until 
enrollment on another study is available (expected by [CONTACT_5638] 2018 and no later than mid 2019).  The exact number of subjects recruited to the HGG cohort will depend on both the recruitment rate of subjects with HGG and the time it takes to begin recruitment to the new study.

All data will be summarized or listed.  Subjects will be summarized based on the treatment level 
to which they were originally assigned. Additionally, selected analyses and summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_483031]. 
Complete details will be provided in the Statistical and Analysis Plan (SAP).  
5.3.1  Analysis Populations  
Populations will be considered for the analysis as follows: The ‘ All Treated ’ population is defined as all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_620515] treatment schedule or drug administration or an early termination of 
treatment will not result in exclusion of subjects from this population.   
The ‘ Safety’ population consists of all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
All safety data will be analyzed using the Safety population. The ‘ DLT Evaluable ’ population is defined as those subjects in Part 1 fulfilling the ‘All 
Treated’ populati on criteria, and having received an adequate treatment for the first [ADDRESS_620516] 28 days will be defined as having received >75% of planned study drug doses, exclusive of missed doses due to treatment -related toxicity.  Any subject in the ‘All Treated’ population 
who experiences a DLT, as defined in Section 3.3, will also be included in the DLT evaluable population regardless of exposure. 
The ‘ PK Population ’ is defined as those subjects fulfilling the All Treated population criteria 
who contribute PK samples.

this interim. In addition, safety and tolerability will be monitored closely on a continued basis.  
Additional interim analyses may be performed to support any health authority requests as and 
when needed.  No efficacy or futility conclusions will be drawn based on these interim analyses.  
5.3.3  Final Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety and Tolerability Analyses  
All relevant safety data will be summarized or listed based on the Safety population. 
All safety data will be reported according to the initial treatment regimen the subject received 
(initial dose of dabrafenib). Additionally, selected analyses and summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_483031].  AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_483032]. The toxicity grade for laboratory data will be calculated using NCI 
CTCA Ev4.0 or higher ( NCI, 2009) .  The lab data will then be summarized according to the 
subjects’ baseline grade and maximum grade for each cycle of therapy (done for each initial dose level of dabrafenib). 
DLTs will be  summarized.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure of dabrafenib will depend on tolerability of the subjects to the doses 
administered and the course of their disease. The number of subjects exposed to dabrafenib will be summarized for each dose level administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded and grouped by [CONTACT_6764].  AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_483033], event type and body system.  Separate summaries will be given for all AEs, drug- related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading  to withdrawal from the study. 
Adverse events (AEs) and toxicities will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE, Version 4.0.  
Summaries of the number of toxicity grades for both laboratory and non -laboratory data will be 
presented.  If the AE is listed in th e NCI -CTCAE, Version 4.0, the maximum grade will be 
summarized.  Otherwise, the maximum intensity will be summarized.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Hematology and clinical chemistry data will be summarized at each scheduled assessment according to NCI CTCAE grade (version 4.0). For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by [CONTACT_3989] v4.0, results will be categorized as low/normal/high based on laboratory normal ranges . Summaries will include data from scheduled assessments only, and all data will be 
reported according to the nominal visit date for which it was recorded; no visit windows will 
be applied. Unscheduled data will be included in “post -baseline” summaries which will capture 
a worst case across all scheduled and unscheduled visits after the fir st dose of study medication. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP.

 [IP_ADDRESS].4  Other Safety Measures  
Performance status (Karnofsky/Lansky) assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_483034].  Vital signs, ECG, and ECHOs will be summarized at a ll measured time 
points.  A descriptive summary including change from baseline pre -dose will also be presented. 
Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK parameters for dabrafenib and its metabolites for subjects in whom the full blood sampling 
scheme was used will be calculated with standard non -compartmental methods.  The PK 
parameters calculated with non -compartmental methods include; AUC(0 -∞) (single  dose only), 
AUC(0 -t), Cmax, Tmax, C τ, CL/F (dabrafenib only), and AUC (0 -τ) (where τ = 12 hours).  For 
subjects in whom the sparse blood sample collection scheme is used, AUC(0- τ) and the average 
steady -state concentration will be estimated with a population PK model.  Final PK parameters 
will be summarized and will be compared to historical adult data.  
All concentration -time data may be combined and included in a population PK analysis that 
will examine the influence of demographics (especially age and w eight) on pharmacokinetics 
of dabrafenib and its metabolites.  PK parameters estimated in the population PK analysis will include: apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F), volume of distribution (V/F), and absorption rate (ka).  Data may be pooled with PK data from adult studies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analyses  
Anti-tumor activities will be calculated based on clinical evidence and the investigator -
determined response assessment algorithms as described in Appendix 2.  Where appropriat e, 
the lesion data will be listed for each subject.  For subjects with solid tumors, the percent change from baseline and nadir will be calculated for each subject and listed, along with their calculated response [complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease and progression of disease (PD)] according to response criteria in Appendix 2. Response data will be summarized by [CONTACT_483035]. If the data warrant, the response data may also be summarized by [CONTACT_483036]. For the LGG, HGG, and other solid tumors disease cohorts, response will also be assessed by [CONTACT_15034], and this data will be used to provide supportive analyses. 
Additionally, al l efficacy analyses will also be performed on the subset of central laboratory 
confirmed BRAF mutant subjects, excluding subjects who were centrally confirmed to be 
BRAF Wild -Type. In the event that central confirmation of mutation status is not obtained, the 
local laboratory testing result for BRAF mutation status will be utilized.  
Response Rate (RR) with 95% exact confidence intervals will be calculated as the proportion 
of subjects with best overall response of confirmed CR or PR, as defined in Appendix 2, relative 
to the total number of subjects treated in each expansion cohort. In the case of LCH subjects, the RR is the number of subjects assessed to have treatment response relative to the total number of subjects treated in that cohort.  See Appendix [ADDRESS_620518] erior probabilities.  A posterior estimate of RR will be calculated 
for each expansion cohort along with associated 95% credible intervals as calculated on 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 70  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 Medical/medication/alcohol history will be assessed as related to the eligibility criteria listed in 
Section 4.2. 
Additional retrospective data will be collected, if available, on subjects with a diagnosis of LGG 
enrolled in all study parts.  The additional data will consist of efficacy assessments (imaging scans, primarily MRI) from the most recent prior chemotherapy regimen to include the baseline assessment (scan taken just before the initiation of the prior chemotherapy) and a time point closest to 6 months following initiation of that therapy. 
6.2 Critical Baseline Assessments  
6.2.1  Confirmation of BRAF Mutation Positive Status  
Subjects with BRAF V600 mutation- positive tumors as determined by [CONTACT_483037] a CLIA -approved facility (or equivalent) may be enrolled on the study. Archived tumor tissue 
sample will be collected at screening for retrospective confir mation of the BRAF mutation 
status.  If an archived tumor tissue sample is not available, fresh tumor tissue should be collected for the assessment and confirmation of BRAF V600 mutation status in a CLIA approved facility (see SPM for further details on sa mple collection).

Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 evaluate the suspension with the child based on verbal and non- verbal feedback.  Additional 
details (and an example questionnaire) are provided in the SPM. 
6.4 Pregnancy 
6.4.1  Time period for collecting pregnancy information 
All pregnancies in female subjects and/or female partners of male subjects will be collected 
after the start of dosing and until [ADDRESS_620524]'s pregnancy.  The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_001].  Generally, follow- up will be no longer than [ADDRESS_620525] pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  The partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_001].  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported. 
6.5 Pharmacokinetics 
6.5.1  Blood Sample Collection 
Blood samples for PK analysis of dabrafenib and its metabolites, hydroxy- dabrafenib, carboxy-
dabrafenib, and desmethyl -dabrafenib, will be collected at the time points indicated in Section 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 74  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 3.8, Time and Events Table.  The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be 
recorded.  The timing of PK samples may be altered to ensure thorough PK monitoring (but the total number of samples  and total blood volume collected will not change).  Plasma 
concentrations of dabrafenib and its metabolites (hydroxy- dabrafenib, carboxy- dabrafenib, and 
desmethyl- dabrafenib) will be determined from the 2 mL blood samples collected.  Plasma 
concentrations of dabrafenib and certain metabolites (hydroxy- dabrafenib and desmethyl -
dabrafenib) will be determined from the 1 mL blood samples collected. Carboxy- dabrafenib 
will not be determined from the 1 mL blood sample. 
Details of PK blood sample collection (including volume to be collected), processing, storage 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_482968] (SPM). 
6.5.2  Sample Analysis  
Until 31 Dec 2015 plasma analysis was performed under the management of Bioanalytical 
Science and Toxicokinetics, Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Platform Technology and Sciences, [COMPANY_004] and raw data is stored in the GlaxoSmithKline Archives until transfer to [COMPANY_001] archive. Since 1 Jan 2016 plasma analysis is performed under the management of [COMPANY_001] DMPK and r aw data are stored in the archives of the analytical site until transfer to 
[COMPANY_001] archive.  
Concentrations of dabrafenib and its metabolites (hydroxy- dabrafenib, desmethyl -dabrafenib, 
and carboxy- dabrafenib) will be determined in plasma  samples using validated analytical 
methods. Once the plasma has been analyzed for dabrafenib and its metabolites, any remaining plasma may be analyzed qualitatively for other circulating metabolites or quantitatively to perform long term stability e valuation or cross validation and the results reported under a 
separate DMPK protocol.  
6.6 Anti-tumor Assessment 
Disease progression and response evaluations will be determined according to the appropriate guidelines ( Appendix 2).  
See the Time and Events Table ( Section 3.8) for the schedule of assessments.  Assessments 
must be performed on a calendar schedule and should not be affected by [CONTACT_90627] /delays.  For post baseline assessments, a window is permitted to allow for flexible 
scheduling (see Time and Events Table, Section 3.8).  
Confirmation of CR and partial response (PR) are required per protocol.  Complete response/PR confirmation assessments may take place at Week  16 (but not earlier than week 12) if initial 
response was seen at the Week  8 assessments.  Initial responses (CR/PR) that occur at Week  16 
(or after) should be confirmed not less than 4 and not more than 8 weeks after the initial response.  If a confirmation assessment is performed prior to the next protocol schedule assessment, the next protocol scheduled evaluation is still required (e.g. evaluations must occur at each protocol s cheduled time point regardless of unscheduled assessments).  If the criteria 
for a CR or PR are not confirmed, then stable disease can be considered the best response if it has been demonstrated for a minimum of 12 weeks.

Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 b. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without 
hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_104].  
c. Sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) for male partners. The vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.  
d. Placement of a hormonal or non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per  year.  
All menstruating female  subjects (as required per local requirements and/or regulations) must 
have a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_620526] dose of study drug, it does not need to be repeated on Day 1 (pre -dose). All female 
subjects who begin to menstruate during the study must have a negative serum pregnancy test (as required per local requirements and/or regulations) during the study and for [ADDRESS_620527] dose of study drug. 
NOTES:   
• Oral contraceptives are not considered as highly effective methods of contraception due to 
potential drug-drug interactions with dabrafenib. 
• Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/cream/suppository) are not considered highly effective methods of contraception per Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines [Clinical Trial Facilitation Group 2014] 
• Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have 
had 12 months of natural  (spontaneous) amenorrhea with  an appropriate clinical profile 
(i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation  at least  
six weeks  ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,  only when  the reproductive status of 
the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_6592]. 
7.1.2  Male Subjects  
Male subjects (including those that have had a vasectomy)  taking dabrafenib in the study must 
use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and not to father a child during the study and for the period of 4 weeks following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1460]. 
7.2 Meals and Dietary Restrictions 
Subjects no longer need to abstain from ingestion of any food or drink containing grapefruit and grapefruit juice, Seville  oranges (orange marmalade) or pommelos within [ADDRESS_620528] to tolerate the fasting conditions noted above, dabrafenib can be administered with a small non- fat meal (e.g., small 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 77  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 amou nt of apple juice/sauce, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_482959]). Subjects and their parents should be advised 
to avoid administering dabrafenib with milk or high- fat, high- calorie foods. Children that are 
breastfeeding may continue to breast feed on demand.  If child is breast fed during collection 
of PK samples the time of breastfeeding should be recorded. 
If a subject vomits after taking study medication, the subject should be instructed not to retake 
the dose and should take the next scheduled dose. 
If a subject misses a dose, subject should not double the next regularly scheduled dose. 
However, subject can take the missed dose immediately if the next scheduled dose is at least [ADDRESS_620529] should take the next dose at its usual time. 
7.3 Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco  
• On PK sampling days, subjects will abstain from ingesting caffeine- or xanthine-containing products (e.g. coffee, tea, cola drinks, energy drinks) for [ADDRESS_620530] sample.  
• On PK sampling days, subjects will abstain from alcohol for [ADDRESS_620531] sample.  
• Subjects who use tobacco products will be instructed that use of nicotine-containing products (including nicotine patches) will not be permitted while they are in the Clinical Unit.  
7.4 Activity 
Subjects will abstain from strenuous exercise (e.g., competitive sports) for [ADDRESS_620532] dose of study treatment.  Any concomitant 
medication(s), including dietary supplements, taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF.  The minimum requirement is that drug name, dose, and the dates of administration are 
to be recorded.  Additionally, a complete list of all prior surgical procedures will be recorded in the eCRF.   
Subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of blood 
and blood products, and treatment with antibiotics, anti- emetics, anti -diarrheals, and analgesics, 
and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance with their institutional guidelines.  Use of anticoagulants such as warfarin is permitted, however, caution should be exercised and additional International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring is recommended when dabrafenib is used concomitantly with warfarin.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 78  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 Immunization is permitted while on dabrafenib if subject has been on treatment and is deemed 
stable.  
8.2 Prohibited Medications and Non-Drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482969] 28 days or 5 half -lives, whichever is 
shorter, prior to randomization and for the duration of the study will not be allowed.  
The following medications or non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482970]: 
• Other anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  
• Other investigational drugs; 
• Antiretroviral drugs; 
• Herbal remedies (e.g., St. John’s wort); 
• Dabrafenib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_13439] P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4.  Co-
administration of dabrafenib with ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibition, or with gemfibrozil, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, resulted in increases in dabrafenib AUC of 71% and 47%, respectively. Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and CYP2C8 (see list in Table 8-1) may only be used under special circumstances (e.g. as a single use for a procedure) while treatment with study drug is interrupted as they may alter dabrafeni b concentrations; consider therapeutic substitutions for these medications.  
Approval of the [COMPANY_001] Medical Lead is required in these situations. The list may be modified based on emerging data. Refer to the SPM for the most current list.  
Table 8-1  Prohibited Medications  
PROHIBITED – strong inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C8, since concentrations of dabrafenib may be 
decreased

8.3 Medications to be Used with Caution 
The following medications should be used with caution as their concentrations may be altered by [CONTACT_483038]: 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 79  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 • Drugs that are moderate inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and CYP2C8 as they may alter 
concentrations of dabrafenib. 
• Dabrafenib has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 in vivo using midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) and S-warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate).  Dabrafenib is an in vitro inducer of CYP2B6 and other enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C19, UDP-glucuronyl transferases. Transporters may also be affected.  Co -administration of dabrafenib and 
medications which are affected by [CONTACT_483039] (including warfarin) and transporters may result in loss of efficacy.  If co- administration of these medications is 
necessary,  investigators should monitor subjects for loss of efficacy or consider 
substitutions of these medications. A partial list of these medications is provided in Table 8-2 and in the SPM. 
• Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with approval by [CONTACT_483040]/INR by [CONTACT_779]. Warfarin exposure has been shown to decrease (37% decrease) due to dabrafenib -mediated enzyme induction. Conversely, if 
dabrafenib dosing is reduced, interrupted, or discontinued, warfarin exposure may be increased. Thus, warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based on PT/INR during and after treatment with dabrafenib. Prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central catheter patency.

Refer to Section 3.7 for dose adjustment/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]. 
A subject may withdraw from study treatment at any time at his/her own request, at the request 
of his/her parents, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. 
9.[ADDRESS_620535] to follow -up, has withdrawn consent, or at the investigator’s discretion is 
no longer being followed. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_620536] Withdrawal from Study Treatment  
Subjects will rece ive study treatment until disease progression, death or unacceptable AE 
(including meeting stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482975] 3.7.8 or for 
hematologic and other non- hematologic toxicity as described in Section 3.7.2).  Treatment 
beyond disease progression may be considered if the investigator determines that the subject is 
still clinically benefiting from study treatment and the subject or their parent (guardian) is willing to continue study drug, following consultation with the study Medical Lead. In this case, the study treatment as well as the study procedures may be continued until study treatment 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 81  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 discontinuation.  These subjects will be considered as having progressi ve disease (as of the date 
of the scan showing progression). 
Study medication may also be permanently discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
• deviation(s) from the protocol that result in a significant risk to the patient’s safety;  
• request of the subject or parent/guardian’s request 
• investigator’s discretion  
• subject is lost to follow -up 
• study is closed or terminated. 
The primary reason study treatment was permanently discontinued must be documented in the 
subject’s medical records and electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
If the subject voluntarily discontinues from treatment due to toxicity, ‘adverse event’ should be recorded as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation on the eCRF. 
Once a subject has permanently discontinued from study treatment, the subject will not be 
allowed to be retreated.  
All subjects who discontinue from study treatment will have a Final Visit (as defined in Table 10) which should be completed at the time of discontinuation (within [ADDRESS_620537] dose of study drug). Subjects will be offered post study treatment follow -up as specified in Section  9.4. 
If the decision to discontinue the patient occurs at a regularly scheduled visit, that visit may become the EOT visit rather than having the patient return for an additional visit. 
9.3.[ADDRESS_620538]: 
• Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and  
• Does not allow further collection of personal data.  
• In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e-
mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been col lected at 
subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_483042]-up. 
• All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdra wal. A 
final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table.  
[COMPANY_001] will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of a subject’s sam ples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable 
law. 
For US and Japan: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analysis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 82  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 For EU and RoW: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no 
longer be used, unless permitted by [CONTACT_1289]. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements.  
9.4 Treatment after the End of the Study 
After study participation in the current study and for subjects still benefitting from treatment 
with dabrafenib, subjects will be given the option to transition to the rollover study, where 
subjects continue receiving dabrafenib alone as specified in rollover study, provided subjects are still benefiting from dabrafenib.  
Subjects who are no longer receiving dabrafenib will be offered Follow -Up from [COMPANY_001] 
consisting of a visit every 3 months (±15 days) for a period of 2 years.  At each visit, the following assessments will be performed:  
• Brief history and physical exam (a brief physical examination will include assessments of 
the skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen) [and neurological exam as clinically indicated]; brief physi cal exam to also include dermatologic evaluation, 
growth, and sexual maturation); 
• History to review development; 
• History of new malignancies or secondary malignancies, or other significant changes. 
Subjects who discontinued dabrafenib treatment will be followed every [ADDRESS_620539]’s medical condition, whether or n ot [COMPANY_001] is providing specific post -study 
treatment.

to form a suspension. Detailed instructions for the dispersion of the tablets and dosing will be provided in the SPM. 
Study treatment must be dispensed or administered according to procedures described 
herein.   Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study treatment.  Only authorized site 
staff may prepare and supply [administration will be performed by [CONTACT_438182]] study treatment.   All study treatment must be stored in a secure area with access limited to the  
investigator and authorized site staff.   
Dabrafenib capsules are to be stored at room temperature up to 30°C.   Maintenance of a 
temperature log (manual or automated) is required. 
Dabrafenib powder for oral suspension is to be stored at up to 30°C.   Maint enance of a 
temperature log (manual or automated) is required. 
Dabrafenib dispersible tablets are to be stored at up to 25°C.   Maintenance of a temperature log 
(manual or automated) is required. 
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance.  The 
investigator or the head of the medical institution (where applicable), or designated site staff (e.g., storage manager, where applicable) must maintain study treatment accountability records throughout the course of the study.  The responsible person(s) will document the amount of 
study treatment received from and returned to [COMPANY_001] and the amount supplied and/or administered to and returned by [CONTACT_1766].  The required accountability units for this study will 
be number of capsules, number of dispersible tablets, or weight of suspension.  Discrepancies 
are to be reconciled or resolved.   Procedures for final disposition of unused study treatment are 
listed in the SPM.  
Investigational product is not expected to pose significant occupational safety risk to site staff under normal conditions of use and administration.  Take adequate precautions to avoid direct 
eye or skin contact  [CONTACT_23968].  Notify the monitor of any 
unintentional occupational exposure.  A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent 
document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required by [CONTACT_1207], or is available upon request from [COMPANY_001] . 
However, precautions are to be taken to avoid direct skin contact, eye contact, and generating aerosols or mists.   In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, 
medical lead  and/or study manager. 
10.4 Assessment of Compliance 
When subjects are dosed at the study site, they will receive study treatment directly from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision.  The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents.  The dose of study treatment and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person admini stering the study treatment.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 84  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 When dosing occurs outside the clinic, parents/subjects will be provided a supply of study drug 
(powder stickpacks, dispersible tablets, or capsules).  On each return visit to the clinic, the parent/subject will return all unus ed study drug in its dispensed container, and the study site 
staff will note the number of capsules, number of tablets, or number of stickpacks returned in the source documents. 
10.[ADDRESS_620540] for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities.  
Further management should be as clinically indicated or as recommended by [CONTACT_483043], where available.  Haemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of 
dabrafenib as it is highly bound to plasma proteins. 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications should be made by [CONTACT_483044] a [COMPANY_001] Medical Lead based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 
A plasma sample for PK analysis may be requested by a [COMPANY_001] Medical Lead on a case-by-
case basis.   This plasma sample should be collected as soon as possible. 
Information regarding the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing should be documented in the eCRF. 
11 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
(SAE) 
The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that 
meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 
AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment and until the end of the follow-up 
period.  
SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs.  However, any SAEs 
assessed as related to study participation (e.g. study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, 
invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a [COMPANY_001] product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow -up 
contact.  All SAEs will be recorded and reported to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_620541] has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator would promptly notify [COMPANY_001].

Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 11.[ADDRESS_620542]. 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or e xacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE include : 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including eit her an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a s uspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suic idal/self -harming intent.  This 
should be reported regardless of sequelae.). 
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE.  However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting  from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated  with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_99479]’s condition. 
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience ad mission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.

Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 11.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
If an event is not an AE per Section 11.1, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease, etc.). 
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening 
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85264]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complic ation prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE. 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482976].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such event s are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
g. All events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as ALT 
≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥  2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT ≥  3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR 
measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not required and the threshold 
value stated will not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants). NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 87  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 criterion of total bilirubin ≥  2xULN, then the event is still reported as an SAE. If INR is 
obtained, include values on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.[ADDRESS_620543] severe liver injury 
h. Protocol- specific SAEs: LVEF meeting stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]; any new primary cancers and 
treatment emergent malignancies (including squamous cell carcinoma and new primary 
melanoma); basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is required to be reported as a protocol -specific 
SAE for all non- melanoma indications.  
11.3 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended and non-
leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.  Appropriate questions include: 
• “How are you feeling?” or “How does your child seem to feel?” 
• “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” or “Has your 
child had any (other) medical problems or seem to act differently in any way sinc e his/her 
last visit/contact?”  
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact?” or “Has your child needed to take any medicines, other than those provided in this study, since his/her last visit/contact?”  
11.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to the event.  The investigator will then record  all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the appropriate 
data collection tool.  
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records to 
[COMPANY_001] in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_001], AE/SAE data collection  tool.  However, there 
may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_482977].  In this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_482978]. 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
11.5 Evaluating AEs and SAEs 
11.5.1  Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and will assign it to one of the following categories: 
Mild:  An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_3433] e subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 88  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 Severe:  An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE. 
11.5.2  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  A "reasonable possibility" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. 
For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
11.6 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -
up. 
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_483045]/or causality of the AE or SAE.   The investigator is obligated to assist.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professionals.  If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator will provide 
[COMPANY_001] with a copy of any post-mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed data collection tool.  
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to [COMPANY_001] within the designated reporting time frames.  
11.[ADDRESS_620544] all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying [COMPANY_001] of the event and completing the appropriate data collection tool.  The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial report as described in Section 11.5.2, Assessmen t of Causality.  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 89  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 The primary mechanism for reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_001] will be the electronic data collection 
tool.  If the electronic system is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to a Novar tis Medical Lead.  Then the site will enter the 
SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., InForm system) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  If a 
site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, the site 
can repor t this information on a paper SAE form or to their [COMPANY_001] protocol contact [CONTACT_483046]. 
[COMPANY_001] contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the 
Sponsor/Medical Lead Contact [CONTACT_23774]. 
11.[ADDRESS_620545] under clinical investigation.  [COMPANY_001] will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities, IRBs/IECs and investigators. 
Invest igator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requirements and [COMPANY_001] policy and are forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  An investigator who receives an investigator safety repor t 
describing an SAE(s) or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from [COMPANY_001] will file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

 • If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xULN and bilirubin <2xULN, then monitor 
subjects twice monthly until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline values.  
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_620549] 
Drug Restart/Rechallenge Following Liver Events that are Possibly Related to Study Treatment  
Approval by [CONTACT_483049]: 
• The subject is receiving compelling benefit, benefit of drug restart exceeds risk, and no 
effective alternative therapy is available.  Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval of drug restart/rechallenge must be obtained, as required. 
• If the restart/rechallenge is approved by [CONTACT_483050], the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. 
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the study treatment restart/rechallenge.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart.  
• Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by [CONTACT_5343]. 
Subjects approved by [CONTACT_483051]/rechallenge of study treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry tests until stable, liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol.  
Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to Study

 13.6 Records Retention 
Following closure of the study, the investigator or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable) must maintain all site study records, except for those required by [CONTACT_483053], in a safe and secure location.  The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed (e.g., for a [COMPANY_001] audit or regulatory 
inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction with 
assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and staff.   
Where permitted by [CONTACT_1207]/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records 
can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken.  The investigator must assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required.  
Furthermore, the i nvestigator must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions 
and that an acceptable quality control process exists for making these reproductions. 
Essential documents (written and electronic) should be retained for a period of not less tha n 
fifteen (15) years from the completion of the Clinical Trial unless Sponsor provides written 
permission to dispose of them or, requires their retention for an additional period of time because of applicable laws, regulations and/or guidelines. 
The investigator must notify [COMPANY_001] of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, 
but not limited to, archival at an off -site facility or transfer of ownership of the records in the 
event the investigator leaves the site.

 15.2 Appendix 2: Response Criteria 
Response criteria for subjects with solid tumors and measurable disease  
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed based on clinical evidence and the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version  1.1 criteria for solid tumors (Eisenhauer, 2009 ). 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Definitions for assessment of response for target lesio n(s) are as follows:  
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes must be <10 mm in the short axis.  
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a re ference, the baseline sum of the diameters (e.g. percent change from 
baseline).  
• Stable Disease:  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease. 
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in  the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started (e.g. percent change from nadir, where nadir is defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start).  In addition, the sum must have an absolute 
increase from nadir of 5  mm. 
• Not Applicable (NA):  No target lesions at baseline.  
• Not Evaluable (NE):  Cannot be classified by [CONTACT_483055]. 
Note:  
• If lymph nodes are documented as target lesions the short axis is added into the sum of the diameters (e.g. sum of diameters is the sum of the longest diameters for non-nodal lesions and the short axis for nodal lesions).  When lymph nodes decrease to non- pathological size 
(short axis <10 mm) th ey should still have a measurement reported in order not to 
overstate progression. 
• If at a given assessment time point all target lesions identified at baseline are not assessed, 
sum of the diameters cannot be calculated for purposes of assessing CR, PR or stable 
disease or for use as the nadir for future assessments.  However, the sum of the diameters of the assessed lesions and the percent change from nadir should be calculated to ensure that progression has not been documented.  If an assessment of PD cannot be made, the response assessment should be NE. 
• All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) should have their measurements recorded even when very small (e.g. 2 mm).  If lesions are present but too small to measure, 5 mm should be recorded and should contribute to the sum of the diameters, unless it is likely that the lesion has disappeared in which case 0 mm should be reported. 
• If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should continue to be measured.  The response at the time when the lesion reappears will depend upon the status of the other lesions.  For example, if the disease had reached a CR status then PD would be documented at the time of reappearance.  However, if the response status was PR or 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 102  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 stable disease the diameter of the reappearing lesion should be added to the remaining 
diameters and response determined based on percent change from baseline and percent change from nadir. 
Evaluation of Non- target Lesions  
Definitions for assessment of response for non- target lesions are as follows: 
• Complete Response (CR):  The disappearance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes identified as a site of disease at baseline must be non -pathological (e.g. <10 mm short 
axis).  
• Non-CR/Non -PD:  The persistence of 1 or more non- target lesion(s) or lymph nodes 
identified as a site of disease at baseline ≥10 mm short axis.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  
• Not Applicable (NA):  No non- target lesions at baseline.  
• Not Evaluable (NE):  Cannot be classified by [CONTACT_91076].  
Note:  
• In the presence of measurable disease, progression on the basis of solely non- target 
disease requires substantial worsening such that even in the presence of stable disease or PR in target disease,  the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. 
• Sites of non-target lesions, which are not assessed at a particular timepoint based on the assessment schedule, should be excluded from the response determination (e.g. non- target 
response does not have to be "Not Evaluable").  
New Lesions  
New malignancies denoting disease progression must be unequivocal.  Lesions identified in follow-up in an anatomical location not scanned at baseline are considered new lesions. 
Any equivocal new lesions should continue to be followed.  Treatment can continue at the 
discretion of the investigator until the next scheduled assessment.  If at the next assessment the 
new lesion is considered to be unequivocal, progression should be documented.   
Evaluation of Overall Response  
Table 15 -1 presents the overall response at an individual time point for all possible 
combinations of tumor responses in target and non- target lesions with or without the appe arance 
of new lesions for subjects with measurable disease at baseline.

Note:  
• Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having "symptomatic deterioration." Objective response status is determined by [CONTACT_91077]. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuat ion of treatment.   
• In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the CR. 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence and will be determined programmatically by [CONTACT_483056].  
• To be assigned a status of stable disease, follow- up disease assessment must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after first dose of study medication at a minimum interval of 
12 weeks.  
• If the minimum time for stable disease is not met, best response will depend on the 
subsequent assessments.  For example if an assessment of PD follows the assessment of stable disease and stable disease does not meet the minimum time requirement the best response will be PD.  Alternative subjects lost to follow -up after a stable disease 
assessment not meeting the minimum time criteria will be considered not evaluable.  
Confirmation Criteria:  
• To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment  should be 
performed at Week  16 if initial response was seen at the Week  8 scan.  Initial responses 
(CR/PR) that occur Week  [ADDRESS_620556] met.  
Response Assessment in Neuro -oncology (RANO) criteria (Glioma Subjects ) 
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed based on clinical evidence and the Response Assessment 
in Neuro-Oncology (R ANO) criteria for solid tumors ( Wen, 2010).  
NOTE: As part of Protocol Amendment V11, the revised RANO criteria for LGG (RANO -
LGG; Wen, 2017) will be used for central independent review.  This review is in addition to 
the previously performed review using RANO ( Wen, 2010).  These criteria are noted in 
section 15.2.   
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 104  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 All measureable and nonmeasureable lesions should be assessed using the same techniques as 
at baseline.  Ideally, subjects should be imaged on the same  MRI scanner, or at least with the 
same magnet strength, for the duration of the study to reduce difficulties in interpreting changes. 
Measurable disease is defined as bidimensionally contrast enhancing lesions with clearly 
defined margins by [CONTACT_28842], with two perpendicular diameters of at least [ADDRESS_620557] or surgical cavity represents  a particularly 
difficult challenge. In general, such lesions should be considered nonmeasurable unless there is a nodular component measuring ≥[ADDRESS_620558] tumor measurements at either pretreatment baseline or after initiation of therapy should be used for determination of progression.   
• Complete response (CR): Complete disappearance of all enhancing measureable and 
nonmeasureable disease on contrast enhanced MRI scan sustained for at least 4 weeks, no new lesions, and stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. In addition, subject must be off steroids or only on physiologic replacement doses.  In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this response will be considered only stable disease. 
• Partial response (PR): Greater than or equal to a 50% reduction, compared to baseline, in the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters for all measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks, no progression of nonmeasureable disease, no new lesions, and stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions.  In addition, subject must be on a corticosteroid dose not greater than the dose a t the time of baseline scan and be stable or improving clinically.  
In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this response will be considered only stable disease.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Greater than or equal to a 25% increase in sum of the pro ducts 
of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids, OR a significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids comp ared with 
baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, not due to comorbid events, OR the appearance of any new lesions, OR clear progression of nonmeasurable lesions, OR definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from tumor, or to decrease in corticosteroid dose.  Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating condition should also be considered as progression.  
• Stable disease: If subject does not qualify for CR, PR, or PD and has stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan and clinically stable status.  In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 105  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging 
and subsequent follow-up imaging shows that this increase in corticosteroid dose was required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
Increase in corticosteroid dose alone, in the absence of clinical deterioration related to tumor, will not be used as a determinant of progression. Subjects with stable imaging studies whose corticosteroid dose was increased for  reasons other than clinical deterioration related to tumor 
do not qualify for stable disease or progression. They should be observed closely. If their corticosteroid dose can be reduced back to baseline, they will be considered as having stable disease; i f further clinical deterioration related to tumor becomes apparent, they will be 
considered to have progression. The date of progression should be the first time point at which corticosteroid increase was necessary.  
The definition of clinical deterioration  is left to the discretion of the treating physician, but it is 
recommended that a decline in the KPS from [ADDRESS_620559] significantly increased in 
size and become measurable (minimal bidirectional diameter of ≥ [ADDRESS_620560], 5 mm apart with 0 -mm skip) will also be considered 
to have experienced progression. The transition from a nonmeasurable lesion to a measurable lesion resulting in progression can theoretically occur with relatively small increases in tumor size (e.g., a 9 X 9mm lesion [nonmeasurable] increasing to a 10 X 11mm lesion [measurable]). Ideally, the change should be significant (>5 mm increase in maximal diameter or ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions).   
In general , if there is doubt about whether the lesion has progressed, continued treatment and 
close follow -up evaluation will help clarify whether there is true progression.  If there is 
uncertainty regarding whether there is progression, the patient may continue on treatment and 
remain under close observation (e.g., evaluated at 4- week intervals). If subsequent evaluations 
suggest that the patient is in fact experiencing progression, then the date of progression should be the time point at which this issue was firs t raised.  
Response assessment in neuro -oncology (RANO) criteria for low -grade gliomas (LGG) 
(RANO -LGG) .   
During the course of the trial, revised RANO criteria specific for LGG have become available (RANO- LGG; Wen, 2017). These criteria will also be used for central independent review per 
Protocol Amendment v11. This review is in addition to the previously performed review using RANO ( Wen, 2010 ). 
According the updated RANO -LGG criteria, the definition of measurable disease is modified. 
Measurable disease is defined as bidimensionally visible lesions on T2 weighted f luid-
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans with clearly defined margins, with two perpendicular diameters of at least 10 mm (or at least two slice thicknesses with no gaps 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 106  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 between slices), visible on two or more axial slices that are preferably, at m ost, 5 mm apart with 
0mm skip. 
Non-measurable disease includes all other lesions, including: 
• unidimensionally measurable lesions 
• lesions with maximal perpendicular diameter  that is both < 10mm and less than two 
slice thicknesses with no gaps between slices  
• lesions with borders that cannot be reproducibly measured 
• dural, bony skull metastases  
• cystic or necrotic lesions (without a nodular component) 
• other measurable lesions that cannot be considered as target lesions 
Lesions composed of a tumor around a cyst or a surgical cavity are considered non- measurable 
unless there is a nodular component that measures [ADDRESS_620561] stable disease for the purposes of this trial.

A lesion not present at baseline and appearing at any follow -up evaluation timepoint (TP)  is 
considered a New Lesion.  
The Investigator/local reader will characterize each new lesion as either equivocal or 
unequivocal (progressive disease). If unsure of a new lesion, the Investigator/local reader will mark it as equivocal and assess at the nex t timepoint if the lesion is present. Appearance of an 
equivocal new lesion does not lead to a determination of PD. If repeat scans confirm the lesion is unequivocal, progression should be retrospectively assigned back to the first observation of the lesio n.  
The evaluation of overall lesion response at each assessment is a composite of the target lesion response, non-target lesion response, the presence of new lesions, corticosteroid use relative to baseline, and clinical status as assessed by [CONTACT_483057]/Karnofsky

Complete Response (CR):  
All of the following criteria must be met: 
a. Complete disappearance of the lesion of T2 or FLAIR imaging. . In the absence of a 
confirming scan at least [ADDRESS_620562] be on no steroids or on physiologic replacement doses only. 
d. Stable or improved clinically, for clinical signs  and symptoms present at baseline and 
recorded to be disease related  
Partial Response (PR):  
All of the following criteria must be met: 
a. Greater than or equal to 50% in the product of perpendicular diameters of the lesion on T2 
or FLAIR imaging sustained for at least 4 weeks compared with baseline.  
b. No new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with radiation effects, and no new or increased size of enhancement  
c. Patients should be on a corticosteroid dose that should not be greate r than the dose at time 
of baseline scan, and should be stable or improved clinically. 
Stable Disease (SD):  
All of the following criteria must be met: 
a. Does not qualify for CR, PR, MR or progression. 
b. Stable area of non -enhancing abnormalities on T2 or FLAIR imaging  
c. No new lesions, no new T2 or FLAIR abnormalities apart from those consistent with 
radiation effects, and no new or increased size of enhancement

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 109  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  
a. A 25% increase of the T2 or FLAIR non- enhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of 
corticosteroids compared with nadir, not attributable to radiation effect or to com orbid 
events  
b. Significant and unequivocal increase of the non-measurable lesions on T2/FLAIR 
c. Development of new lesions or increased size of enhancement 
d. Definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor, or

e. Failure to return for evaluation because of death or deteriorating condition, unless caused by [CONTACT_398156]- related disorders.  
If there is uncertainty regarding whether there is progression, the patient may continue on treatment and rem ain under close observation (e.g., evaluated at 4 -week intervals). If 
subsequent evaluations suggest that the patient is in fact experiencing progression, then the date of progression should be the time point at which this issue was first raised. 
Response Status Unknown: Not Evaluable (NE):  
a. Progressive disease has not been documented and one or more target or non- target lesions 
have not been assessed.  
b. Change in method or technique for assessing target and non- target lesions as that used at 
baseline regardless of the justification of the change; e.g. if a participant develops a 
contraindication to MRI intravenous (IV) contrast media during the trial, a non- contrast 
MRI of the brain can be used (if possible); the participants response should only be recorded as not evaluable or progressive disease.

children younger than 6 years and children older than 6 years with a risk of choking when 
swallowing capsules from inclusion in the study in [LOCATION_009] (pending availability of an oral suspension formulation).  In addition, Amendment 02 changes the QTc stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482934] 500 msec for French subjects (as compared to 530 msec) and adds cardiac monitoring by [CONTACT_6751] (ECHO) at Week 4 as requested by [CONTACT_483062] [the Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de San te (ANSM)].  It is noted in the 
Study Procedures Manual, and highlighted in this country- specific amendment, that ECHOs 
are to be performed by [CONTACT_483063], where possible. 
List of Specific Changes  
Change #1, Section 3.2, Discussi on of Study Design:  in response to ANSM review of the 
protocol. 
Previous Text (last paragraph in Section)  
The study will use the currently available dabrafenib capsule strengths (50 mg and 75 mg) 
from the adult program for children who are able to reliably swallow capsules.  In addition, two lower strength capsules (10 mg and 25 mg) and an oral suspension formulation are available for pediatric subjects who may have difficulty swallowing larger capsules.  The suspension will only be available at those sites that are capable of and meet the applicable regulatory requirements to prepare the suspension.

Section 1.1. Background 
Previous text: 
Dabrafenib ([COMPANY_004]2118436) is a potent and selective inhibitor of BRAF kinase activity with a 
mechanism of action consistent with adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibition.  Dabrafenib has demonstrated suppression of a downstream pharmacodynamic biomarker (phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase [pERK]) in tumor cell lines, demonstrated anti-proliferative activity against multiple BRAF mutation -positive tumor cell lines, achieved 
proximal biomarker suppression and tumor regression in BRAF mutant xenograft models, and has demonstrated significant anti-tumor efficacy in BRAF V600-mutation positive tumors, including melanoma, papi[INVESTIGATOR_6686], and non- small cell lung cancer.  Dabrafenib is 
currently being developed in adult subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced or metastatic melanoma, and is being studied in subjects with other BRAF V600 mutation -
positive tumor types.

Section 1.3. Summary of Risk management 
The following paragraph has been deleted: 
Glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase:   Subjects with a history of known glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency are excluded from clinical trials as they may 
develop nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to dabrafenib which contains a sulfonamide, a potential risk factor for subjects with this deficiency.  No cases of hemolytic anemia have been reported to date in dabrafenib clinical trials.  
 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Escalation

The dose in Part 1 will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached 
(based on toxicity, Section 3.4) OR  in the absence of reach ing the MTD, the dose in which 
the median AUC(0 -τ) is between approximately 4000 ng*h/mL and approximately 5500 
ng*h/mL. The proportion of subjects who achieve an AUC(0- 12) ≥ 4000 ng*h/mL also will 
be considered when selecting the dose for Part 2. In the a bsence of meeting criteria for MTD, 
if <80% of subjects in an age group (≤2 yrs, >2 and ≤12 yrs, >12 yrs) fail to achieve an AUC(0 -12) ≥ approximately 4000 ng*h/mL OR  if fewer than two subjects in a specific age 
group have been evaluated at a given dose level, the study sponsor and study team will review all available safety and PK data and determine if further Part 1 evaluation of a specific age group is required before these subjects may enroll in Part 2. Intermediate doses may be explored.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Skin Toxicity (Rash, Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthaesia syndrome) 
Rash and Palmar -Plantar Erythrodysesthaesia Syndrome (PPES) are frequently observed in 
subjects receiving dabrafenib therapy. Guidelines for management are based on experience 
with other MEK inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors [Balagula, 2010; Lacouture, 2012] and include: 
• Prevention/prophylaxis: promote sunscreen use and avoidance of unnecessary sun exposure, use alcohol- free emollient creams, topi[INVESTIGATOR_482984].  
• Pruritic lesions:  cool compresses and oral antihistamines  
• Fissuring lesions:  Monsel’s solution, silver nitrate or zinc oxide cream 
• Desquamation: thick emollients and mild soap  
• Paronychia:  antiseptic bath, local potent corticosteroids, antibiotics, surgery as needed  
• Infected lesions:  topi[INVESTIGATOR_482985]: 
• Lifestyle modification:  avoidance of hot water, traumatic activity, constrictive footwear, or excessive fr iction on the skin and the use of thick cotton socks and 
gloves, and shoes with padded insoles 
• Symptomatic treatments:  apply moisturizing creams frequently, topi[INVESTIGATOR_477365] (e.g. urea 20-40 % cream, salicylic acid 6%, tazarotene 0.1% cream, fluoroura cil 5% 
cream), clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 0.05% ointment for erythematous areas, topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242] 2%, and / or systemic pain medication such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, codeine, and pregabalin for pain. 
Dose modification may also be required (refer toTable 5 - General Dose Modification Guidelines).  
 
Section 3.7.4. Dose Modification for General Toxicities to Section  3.7.9. Liver

General guidelines regarding management and dose reduction for adverse events that are 
considered by [CONTACT_483068] 5.  These guidelines are intended pr imarily for 
toxicities not easily managed with routine supportive care.  For example, alopecia is not an indication for dose modification, nor is grade 2 nausea and vomiting that can be easily managed with anti- emetics.   
Investigators should always err on the side of caution in these settings if treatment- related 
toxicity is a possibility.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Renal insufficiency  
Cases of renal insufficiency have occurred in adult subjects receiving dabrafenib.  Prior to 
start of study treatment, concomitant medications should be reviewed for the potential risk of inducing nephrotoxicity and concomitant medications should be modifi ed if clinically 
possible.  
Guidelines regarding management and dose reduction for renal insufficiency considered to be 
related to study treatment by [CONTACT_301178] 7. 
TABLE 7  RENAL INSUFFICIENCY GUIDELINES  
For subjects with creatin ine rise  ≥50% from baseline :  
1 st  occurrence  • If subject has fever: treat pyrexia as per Table 6 (please  note NSAIDs can 
induce renal insufficiency, especially in subjects with dehydration); 
consider IV hydration  
• Pediatric nephrology consult is recommended  
• Re-check within 24 hours  
• If creatinine rise is < 25% from baseline:  
• Continue dabrafenib at current dose  
• Monitor creatinine weekly for 4 weeks to ensure levels 
remain within 25% of baseline

New appendix added: 
15.6. Appendix [ADDRESS_620629] enrolled in [LOCATION_009] only.  
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cuSCC) and New primary melanoma  
Dermatological examinations should be performed prior to initiation of study treatment, 
monthly during treatment, and monthly for [ADDRESS_620630] clinical practice.  
Non-cutaneous secondary/recurrent malignancy
 
Prior to initiation of study treatment subjects should undergo a head and neck examination with minimally visual inspection of oral mucosa and lymph node palpation, as well as chest/abdomen Computed Tomography (CT) scan. During treatment subjects should be monitored as clinically appropriate which may include a head and neck examination every [ADDRESS_620631]/abdomen CT scan every 6 months. Anal examinations and pelvic examinations  are recommended before the start of and at the end of treatment or when 
considered clinically indicated. Complete blood cell counts should be performed as clinically indicated. Following discontinuation of dabrafenib monitoring for non-cutaneous 
secondary/recurrent malignancies should continue for up to [ADDRESS_620632]. Any non- cutaneous 
secondary/recurrent malignancy should be reported as a protocol- specific SAE and treated 
according to standard clinical practice.

Footnote added: 1Subjects who are approved for intra-subject dose escalation must provide PK 
samples on day 15 at the higher dose level. 
Section 4.4 Withdrawal from Study and Missing Visits  
New section added: 
Should a subject fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit, the site should attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_131993] -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also 
counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain 
whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance.  
In cases where the subject does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] ([ADDRESS_620637]’s last known mailing address) so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study. These contact [CONTACT_9300]’s medical record.  
Should the subject continue to be unreachable, then and only then will he/she be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow- up”. For all other 
subjects withdrawing from the study, an alternative reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the eCRF.

Section [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation Previous text 
SUMMARY OF AMENDMENT CHANGES WITH RATIONALE  
Amendment [ADDRESS_620640] OF SPECIFIC CHANGES  
Sponsor Information Page (page 4) 
The  monitor was changed from , MD to , MD, 
PhD.  
Section 3.1.1, Part 1 – Dose Escalation  
The following changes were made to the [ADDRESS_620641] paragraph: 
On Day 1, a single first dose will be administered, followed by [CONTACT_483074] ≥ [ADDRESS_620642] dose of 
dabrafen ib.  A second dose may be administered on Day 1 if the timing is in compliance 
with Section 3.6.   
Section 3.1.2, Part 2 – Tumor- Specific Expansion  
The following changes were made to the 2nd paragraph: 
On Day 1, a single first dose will be administered, followed by [CONTACT_483074] ≥ [ADDRESS_620643] dose of 
dabrafenib.  A second dose may be administered on Day 1 if the timing is in compliance 
with Section 3.6.   
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Pyrexia 
Updated recommendations for any occurrence and aligned footnotes: 
• Consider  clinical evaluation for infection and hypersensitivity if clinically warranted  
• Laboratory (local lab) work -up: CBC with differential, chemistry with creatinine, UA with microscopic  
• Hydration as requiredd 
• Blood sample for cytokine analysise 
 
Section 3.8, Time and Events Schedule 
Added the following clarification to comment on tumor tissue for V600 testing: 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 180  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 Local testing for inclusion in the study; can be from archival tissue or if no archival tissue is 
available, from fresh biopsy; the local BRAF test result will be subject to retrospective central confirmation. BRAF testing may be completed prior to the [ADDRESS_620644] dose . 
Added the following clarification to comment on brain MRI: 
If an MRI of the brain was obtained within [ADDRESS_620645] allowed only if brain MRI is contraindicated). Glioma patients are not required to have CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis unless clinically indicated.  
Added the following clarification to comment on study medication: 
Dispense a [ADDRESS_620646] dose 
reductions, dose interruptions/delays, and/or dose escalations. Two doses may be 
administered the first day if the time between doses is in compliance with protocol sectio n 
3.6. 
Section 4.2.1, Inclusion Criteria 
Added refractory disease to inclusion criterion #3: 
Recurrent disease, refractory disease, or progressive disease after having received at least one 
standard therapy for their disease 
Section 8.1, Permitted Medications and Non- drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482996]: 
Use of anticoagulants such as warfarin is permitted, however, caution should be exercised 
and additional International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring is recommended when dabrafenib is used conc omitantly with warfarin . 
Section 8.2, Prohibited Medications and Non-drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482997]: 
[COMPANY_004]2118436 is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_13439] P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4.  Co -
administration of dabrafenib with ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibition, or with 
gemfibrozil, a CYP2C8 inhibitor, resulted in increases in dabrafenib AUC of 71% and 47%, respectively . Drugs that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A and CYP2C8... 
Inserted anti -retroviral agents Ritonavir, Saquinavir, Atazanavir  to Table 12. 
Section 8.3, Medications to be Used with Caution 
Clarifications to second bullet: 
Dabrafenib has been shown to induce CYP3A4 and CYP2C9  in vivo using midazolam 
(CYP3A4 substrate)  and S -warfarin (CYP2C9  substrate).  [COMPANY_004]2118436 is an in vitro i nducer 
of CYP2B6 and other enzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C19, UDP -glucuronyl transferases. 
Transporters  may also be affected.  Co -administration of dabrafenib and medications which 
are affected by [CONTACT_483039] (including warfarin) and trans porters  may 
result in loss of efficacy... 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 181  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)   Protocol No. BRF116013  
 
 New information to third bullet: 
Therapeutic level dosing of warfarin can be used with approval by [CONTACT_483075]/INR by [CONTACT_779]. Warfarin exposure has been shown to decrease (37% decrease) due to dabrafenib -mediated enzyme induction. Conversely, if dabrafenib 
dosing is reduced, interrupted, or discontinued, warfarin exposure may be increased. Thus, warfarin dosing may need to be adjusted based on PT/INR during and after treatmen t with dabrafenib.  Prophylactic low dose warfarin may be given to maintain central 
catheter patency  
New fourth bullet: 
Dabrafenib solubility is pH -dependent with decreased solubility at higher pH. Drugs such 
as proton pump inhibitors that inhibit gastric a cid secretion to elevate gastric pH may 
decrease the solubility of dabrafenib and reduce its bioavailability. No clinical study has 
been conducted to evaluate the effect of pH on dabrafenib pharmacokinetics. In an ad-hoc analysis, no differences in Cmax
 and AUC were noted between subjects who reported 
taking pH -elevating products relative to other subjects. Due to the theoretical risk that 
pH-elevating agents may decrease oral bioavailability and exposure to dabrafenib, these 
medicinal products that increas e gastric pH should be used with caution when 
administered with dabrafenib.

 Amendment 03  
WHERE  THE AMENDMENT APPLIES  
Amendment 03 applies to all sites conducting the study.   
SUMMARY OF AMENDMENT CHANGES WITH RATIONALE  
To take into account potential renal effects, Amendment 03 changed the lower age limit of 
inclusion criterion #2 from subjects 1 mo nth old to ≥12 months old, adjusted criteria for 
adequate renal function in inclusion criterion #7, added guidelines for renal insufficiency and additional laboratory testing.  Information on the new suspension formulation was incorporated. The section on dose modification was re -organized for consistency. The Time and Events Table 
was adjusted to include assessments on Day 21, Week [ADDRESS_620647] es for subjects <25 kg and ≥[ADDRESS_620648] OF SPECIFIC CHANGES  
Sponsor Information Page (page 4): 
The  medical monitor was changed from , MD to , MD. 
The IND No. was changed from 105, 032 to 117,898. Section 1.2.2, Dose Rationale Units corrected from µg*h/mL to ng*h/mL. Section 1.3, Summary of Risk Management Added the following paragraph to the section on acute renal failure: In juvenile rat studies, dose -dependent effects on kidney (tubular deposits with secondary 
changes, increased incidence of cortical cysts and tubular basophilia, tubular dilation and 
reversible increases in serum urea and/or creatinine concentrations) were observed.  Renal toxicity has not been observed in adult rats, dogs or mice  given dabrafenib for up 
to [ADDRESS_620649] -weaning (postnatal day 22), there was no 
progression in the severity of renal findings nor were there any secondary changes.   The observation of greater renal toxicity in rats < 22 days  old suggests a higher risk for tubular 
injury for human infants <1 years of age based on comparison of renal maturation rates, and a correspondingly lower risk for patients between 1 and 4 years of age. 
Section 3.1.1, Part 1 – Dose Escalation  
Revised text : 
Beyond the sixth subject in an ongoing cohort, additional subjects wanting to be enrolled before 
the next cohort is open for enrollment, can be enrolled at the previous lower dose level (this is 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 183  
Amended Protocol Version 11 (Clean)  Protocol No. BRF116013  
to ensure that any subject eligible for enrolment is given a place in the study but is not de
escalation ). 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Dose Escalation 
Units corrected from µg*h/mL to ng*h/mL. 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], Selection of Final Dose(s) for Part 2 
Previous text: 
After the selection of the dose to be administered in Part 2, consideration may be given based 
on the age of subjects (subjects younger than 2 years of age, subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_620650] older 
than 6 years of age, and subjects ≥ 6 years of age) enrolled in Part 1.  That is, if the dose level 
for Part 2 is identified based on data from fewer than 2 subjects in an age group, Part 1 can 
remain open in an attempt to enrol subjects in a different age group to confirm the previously 
selected Part 2 dose (i.e., Part [ADDRESS_620651] not been evaluated in Part 1).  This will allow for selection 
of a different Part 2 dose for subjects in that particular age group, if necessary. 
Revised text:  
Data from all enrolled subjects will be considered at the time o f Part 2 dose selection. 
However, if there are insufficient data in a specific age category at the time of Part 2 dose 
selection, additional patients in that age category may continue to be enrolled into Part 1. Age categories are ≥1 year but ≤5 years of a ge and ≥6 years but <[ADDRESS_620652] two subjects at the Part 2 dose in each age category before Part 1 of the protocol is considered fully enrolled for that age category.  Once sufficient data are available for subjects from a given age category, all subsequent subjects in that age group should be enrolled into Part 2 of the protocol.  With this approach, it is possible that the Part 2 dose will not be identical across age groups. 
Section 3.1.2, Part 2: Tumor- Specific Expansion  
Previous text:  
Treatment with dabrafenib will be continued until disease progression or until subjects are no longer obtaining clinical benefit from continued treatment, until they develop an unacceptable toxicity, or until they withdraw consent or begins a new therapy.   
Revised text:  
Treatment with dabrafenib will be continued until disease progression, until the subject is no 
longer obtaining clinical benefit from continued treatment, they develop an unacceptable toxicity, the study is terminated , or the subject withdraws consent or begins a new therapy.

can induce renal insufficiency, especially in subjects wit h dehydration); 
consider IV hydration  
• Pediatric nephrology consultation recommended  
• Re-check within 24 hours  
• If creatinine increase of ≥100% or eGFR decrease of >50% is confirmed, permanently discontinue dabrafenib  
• If creatinine increase ≥50% or eGFR decre ase >25% from baseline and 
≤50% from baseline, continue to hold dabrafenib and follow guidelines 
above  
• If creatinine increase <50% or eGFR is ≤25% decrease from baseline may restart dabrafenib

SUMMARY OF AMENDMENT CHANGES WITH RATIONALE  
Amendment No. 01 corrected Inclusion Criteria #6 to ensure consistency with the contraception 
requirements as outlined in Section 7.1.1.  In addition, the  dose escalation procedure table 
provided in Appendix 1 was changed to ensure that escalation of dose when 6 subjects are enrolled occurs only if there are ≤[ADDRESS_620659] O F SPECIFIC CHANGES  
Section 4.2.1, Inclusion Criteria (#6) 
Rationale for change:  The requirement for male contraception was deleted since the risk of 
embryofetal developmental toxicity as a consequence of exposure to female pregnant partners 
is very low.

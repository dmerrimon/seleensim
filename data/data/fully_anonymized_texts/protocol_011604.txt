STU2019-1363, Armendariz, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 04-22-20 (3)  Introduction and Purpose  
 
Nurs es and apheresis technician s caring for patients requiring  therapeutic apheresis 
procedures (TAP) utilize a wide ra nge of intravenous catheters to obtain the access required  to 
perform their procedures( Kalantari, 2012), ( Golestaneh & Mokrzycki, 2013). The standard of 
care for our facility is to use an 18-gauge apheresis needle (Medisystems ®) for the access site  
and an 18-gauge autogard catheter for the return site. Unfortunately , there is minimal  literature  
defining best practice s for catheter  size selection (Salazar et al., 2017).  At UT Southwestern 
Medical Center , our goal is to provide  peripheral therapy to reduce the need for central access, 
such as a med ical ports or tunneled catheter s(Spi[INVESTIGATOR_182695]., 2018).  However, t he requirement for 
an 18 gauge catheter for  an adequate return site, at times, rules out the patient for peripheral 
therapy( Putensen, Leverett, Patel, & Rivera, 2017).  This  requires  central venous access to be 
obtained, which can delay the start of the procedure.  
The lack of scientific evidence to support the use of smaller peripheral return 
catheters has increase d the use of implanted  ports in our institution (Putensen et al., 2017).  
The objectives of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_182696]- centered and include analyzing the safety of using 
smaller peripheral return catheters without increas ing the  risk of hemolysis.  
Background and Significance  
TAP  treats a wide range of disease processes and, in all cases, requires inlet  and return 
venous access to perform the procedure. The goal of TAP  is to return the patient to baseline and 
maintain independence and function. A larger needle (18 gauge ) can cause more discomfor t to 
the patient as well as additional scarring.  A smaller needle may present less discomfort and 
scarring to the patient. Our goal in our outpatient clinic is to minimize disruption to the patient’s routine and help them maintain normal activities  of daily living.  
To accomplish these goals, our outpatient clinic is open Monday thru  Friday offering [ADDRESS_215792] receive a 
vein evaluation to see if the patient is a candidate for peripheral IV therapy.  At our clinic, approximately 68% of our TAP’s  are performed peripheral ly. This eliminates the risk of a central 
line infection and any alteration in activities  of da ily living , such as bathing( Kramer, 2016), 
(Shang, Ma, Poghosyan, Dowding, & Stone, 2014),( Keller et al., 2018 ; McDiarmid, 2015).

STU2019-1363, Armendariz, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 04-22-20 (3)  Our hypothesis , is that the 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics catheter  provide s the same 
efficacy as current practice with no increase in adverse events for patients undergoing 
therapeutic apheresis.   The results from our study will be significant because if the [ADDRESS_215793] catheter (control group) which 
will be compared to the 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics  (intervention).  
P – patients who require therapeutic apheresis procedures (TAP)  
I – use of 20G BD diff usics catheter during apheresis  
C – use of [ADDRESS_215794] of care IV catheter during apheresis  
O – no difference in efficacy and no increase in safety events  
Concise Summary of Project  
This is a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_182697] (SOC) 
vs the BD Nexiva Diffusics Catheter . It is a single  blinded, randomized study . Data will be used 
to refine and power a full randomized control trial . For this study, a sample of 33 encounters in 
each group (total of 66 encounters). Our specific aim is to test the hypothesis that the 20-gauge 
BD Nexiva Diffusics Catheter provide s the same efficacy  and lower pain level with no increase 
in adverse events fo r patients undergoing apheresis treatments.  
 
Randomization Procedure  
After an eligib le participant is consented to the study the patient will be randomized 
without replacement to the use of one of the two catheters. Using a random number generator, numbers between (1- 66) were randomly divided into two groups: SOC Control group and BD 
Intervention  group (Figure 1). A s tudy identification number (SID) key will be saved on a 
UTSW approved secure device and only the research coordinator will have access to the SID key  
showing which SID coordinates with each group. This will ensure that unblinding can occur is 
necessary and there is a backup to randomization.   
The research coordinator will have 66 randomized envelops without replacement. Half of 
the envelops wil be assigned to  18G catheter SOC (control) and the other half  be assigned to

randomized after they have consented to the study.  Participants’ will then be randomized to one of the two groups again at each encounter (i.e., SOC visit). Inside the envelope it will tell the investigator if the patient is in the control or intervention group of the study.    To promote a more representative sample, each patient may participate a maximum of 10 times .  
 Study procedure : 
Each enrolled patient will 
participate in the study will be randomized at each  encounter. 
During each encounter the following information will be captured: 
1. CBC  
2. Patient discomfort level with placement of catheter  
3. Inlet rate  
4. Return line pressures  
5. Procedures alarms  
6. Procedure total time  
7. Post procedure sample   
 
Treating nurse (RN)  will start the TAPs procedure with one of the [ADDRESS_215795] the study data collection form (DCF, Appendix1).  
The RN will complete the pre -assessment including a pain assessment to establish pain level 
prior to procedure that is currently documented in the electronic medical record. The p atient will 
be asked to self -report the  pain level after the return line has been started on the visual analog 
scale ( VAS ) Scale from 0mm to 100mm “[ADDRESS_215796]/ no pain, 100mm being the highest Figure 1. REPLACE study desig n

the pain level when starting the return line. The RN will collect a CBC before the start of the 
procedure which will be used in the programing of the TAP procedure.  The  RN will start 
recording the “inlet rate, return line pressures, and alarms” every 15 minutes until the procedure is complet ed.  
Before patient disconnects , and after the completion of procedure sing the same therapeutic 
apheresis procedure access site, a blood sample will be drawn by [CONTACT_101035]  2 lavender top tubes 
(4ml) for plasma hemoglobin test. The plasma hemoglobin test will be sent to the UTSW lab for 
analysis of hemoloysis and results will be sent back directly to the PI. Blood sample results will be collected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_182700] (CRF) that will be saved on a secure drive on the UTSW campus.  
Hemolysis is defined as the destruction of red blood cells which leads to the release of 
hemoglobin from the red blood cells into the blood plasma. Each patient will be tested for hemolysis by [CONTACT_182707]. This will be collected in a two lavender tops (4ml) The cost for this test is covered by [CONTACT_182708].. There is no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_182701] 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics Catheter will increase this risk. Hemolysis will be scored dichotomously as present or absent for each 
encounter.   
Pain is defined as any increase discomfort experienced by [CONTACT_182709]. The current standard of care is to ask the patient “are you having pain” and 
then ask them to rate the pain from 0 to 10. For this study, one additional question will be asked after the patient’s vein has  been accessed (IV catheter in place). The patient will self -report their 
pain using a 100 mm VAS scale. “ The VAS has been used by [CONTACT_182710]”( Klimek et al., 2017) 
Currently, all peripheral apheresis patients have some pain/discomfort while having a treatment, however; it is usually tolerated with minimal complaints.  
Measures of Quality of Apheresis will include inlet rate, and return pressures, 
procedure time. These measures are all readily available in the electronic medical record (EMR) and are all currently recorded as standard of care.

STU2019-1363, Armendariz, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 04-22-20 (3)  The inlet rate is defined as the percent of patient inlet ra te divided by [CONTACT_182711]. Because inlet rates are different for each type of TAP has a different 
maximum inlet rate, this will allow standardization across procedures. The max inlet rate for Photopheresis is 50ml/sec, the max inlet for plasma exchange is 100ml/sec inlet for red blood cell exchange is 55ml/sec.  In addition, the inlet rate for each participant  in the intervention arm 
will be compared to the average of their  last 5 procedures. This measure will compare the 
efficiency  of the SOC verses the intervention.

Sources of Research Material  
There are t hree sources of data for this study: electronic medical record (EMR) and 
paper-and- pen data collection from the patient’s bedside (Data Collection form), and lab results 
provided by [CONTACT_182712] .  The EMR data that will b e collected will include 
demographic information  such as: age, sex, race, ethnicity, and admission diagnosis.  The paper-
and pen- data collection will include the patient self-reported  pain level (VAS Scale), CBC 
collection, procedure data (minutes, inlet rate, return line pressures and alarms) total procedure time and post procedure sample. The paper-and- pen data collection form ( Appendix 1) will

STU2019-1363, Armendariz, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 04-22-20 (3)  Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process  
For this study, patients will be recruited from the Apheresis Unit at UT Southwestern 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182702] a member of the research team. A member of the research 
team will screen the electronic medical record to deter mine a patient’s eligibility.  If a patient 
appears eligible for the study a member of the research team will discuss eligibility criteria with a member of the clinical team (nurse manger, nurse , physician, resident, fellow, social worker). 
The researcher will communicate with the clinical team to ensure eligibility: adult (≥18 years old), speaks and reads English, admitted to the Apheresis Unit at UT Southwestern University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182703]. All patients in this study will be able to provide self-consent (read and speak English).  
When a patient is deemed eligible, a member of the research team will discuss consent 
and study procedures with that patient, in a place that is comfortable for the patient. After being approached by a m ember of the research team, patients will have up to next visit to consider 
participation in the study. The study team expects recruitment of [ADDRESS_215797] approximately 8 months. (Table 1) 
Potential Benefits  
There may or may not be a direct bene fit to the participants in this study. Any additional 
blood test result that seems out of the norm will be shared with the nurse on duty or treating 
physi cian. We would also hope to share this with the greater research and clinical community in 
hopes of finding an alternative way for apheresis patients to have therapeutic apheresis procedures with less pain and no increase in adverse events. 
Potential Risks  
Risks associated with BD Cather:  
  Longer procedure time might occur if the inlet rate of the treatment is slower.  The patient 
will be informed of this during the ICF process. With smaller catheters there’s a risk of not 
obtaining the appropriate return rate for the patient.  When the return rate is out of the SOC 
parameters the SOC apheresis equipment  (Optia or Cellex) will alarm.  If the alarm sounds 3 times 
the RN will decrease inlet rate by 5 ml/sec until the minimum threshold is reached (if needed), 
which is 50 ml/sec for plasma exch ange and 35 ml/sec for RBC exchange and 20 ml/sec for 
photopheresis . If the alarm continues to when the minimum threshold is reached the catheter will 
8 
 
STU2019-1363, Armendariz, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 04-22-20 (3)  be replaced with the SOC 18-gauge catheter.  Obtaining blood samples may cause some discomfort, 
feeling li ghtheaded, fainting, bruising, clotting, and bleeding from the site of the needle stick and, 
in rare cases, infection . The risks are mitigated by [CONTACT_182714]  a line  that has already been 
established as part of SOC.  
There is a low risk of breach in c onfidentiality. Subjects will be assigned individual study 
identification (SID) numbers and no personal identifiers will be included in the final summary.  
Patients who are randomized to the [ADDRESS_215798] of care needle. At the patient’s next visit, the patient will  once 
again be randomized. If the patient is randomized into the 20- guage needle arm and fails the 
intervention a second time, the patient will be removed from the study.  
 
Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality  
Study participants will be given a study identification (SID) number. Only the approved 
study personnel and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_182704]. This database i s kept on a protected drive on a password protected computer. Paper 
or hard copy participant records will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office. If any identifying information is transmitted, it will be done so via secure e -mail and/or dedica ted fax 
machines.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
All data will be first collected  on the DCF ( Appendix I) and then entered into an 
electronic  spreadsheet  (e.g., MS Excel ) which will be converted to SAS v 9.[ADDRESS_215799] measures of central 
tendency (mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range) f or each variable. These 
will be examined to support the assumption of being approximately normally distributed. Baseline characteristics will be summarized using appropriate parametric  and non- parametric 
measures.  
The primary hypothesis is that the 20-gauge BD Nexiva Diffusics catheter provides the 
same efficacy of current practice with no increase in adverse events for patients undergoing therapeutic apheresis. This will be examined in [ADDRESS_215800], ANOVA will be  used to explore 
9 
 
STU2019-1363, Armendariz, FormA-ResearchProtocol, Mod_3, 04-22-20 (3)  efficacy wherein efficacy is represented by 1) the plasma hemoglobin value, and 2) the amount 
of time (minutes) required to complete a TAP. Hence models will be constructed to compare the mean plasma hemoglobin values by [CONTACT_19313], and to compare the mean number of minutes to complete TAP by [CONTACT_19313]. Second, ANOVA will be used to compare the mean number of adverse events subjects experience in each group (intervention vs control).  
Finally, a planned secondary analysis is to examine if the percen t of lumen occupi[INVESTIGATOR_182705]. The suggested standard is that a catheter occupi[INVESTIGATOR_014] < 45% of the inner- lumen diameter (measured with ultrasound). Return pressures > 400 
mm Hg are considered problematic. Chi-square analysis will be used to explore the odds of experiencing a return pressure > 400 mm Hg when the return catheter occupi[INVESTIGATOR_014] <45% of the inner- lumen diameter.

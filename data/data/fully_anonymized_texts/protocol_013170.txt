BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
 
Cigarette smoking among sexual and gender minority (SGM) groups in the [LOCATION_002] is 
higher than heterosexual and cisgender individuals [1]. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) define SGM as an umbrella term that includes individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, asex ual, transgender, Two- Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17040], queer, and/or intersex. It also includes individuals with same - 
sex or - gender attractions or sexual behaviors and those with a difference in sex development, 
as well as those whose sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex development is characterized by [CONTACT_105]- binary constructs [2]. The high rate of cigarette smoking among SGM 
groups is attributed to several factors, including stress due to stigmatization and discrimination, as well as targeted tobacco marketing [3]. Therefore, this population is at an increased risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_253468]- related health conditions such as cancer.  
 
It has been suggested that targeted and tailored interventions could be more effective among 
SGM smokers because they assure a safe, v alidating environment that enhances receptivity to 
cessation [4,5]. The few reported smoking cessation interventions for SGM smokers are 
minimally tailored, lack a control group, lack objective verification of self -reported quit rates, 
and/or are based on group interventions [6- 9]. Mobile health (mHealth) programs that use text 
messaging have been found effective for smoking cessation and other behavioral change interventions. These programs are appealing to marginalized groups who experience barriers to smoking cessation interventions and who have high rates of mobile phone and text messaging 
use because they allow for self -management and discretion [10- 13]. Although the number of 
people enrolled in text messaging programs for smoking cessation is increasing, no study has  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   evaluated their feasibility among SGM smokers.  
 
 
SmokefreeTXT is an automated, personalized, and interactive mHealth program for smoking 
cessation developed by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) that sends text messages 2 weeks before and up to 6 weeks after a smoker’s quit date. Similar programs have been found to be effective and SmokefreeTXT has been tested among the general population as well as subgroups (i.e., pregnant smokers) [10,14 -16]. However, theoretically -based sm oking cessation 
treatments delivered via text messaging and focused on the specific needs of SGM smokers are needed.  
 
 
The rapid increase in the number of people, including SGM individuals, owning a mobile telephone has led to the development of new applic ations in the self -management of behavioral 
change interventions [17]. The proposed text -based smoking cessation intervention will include 
motivational messages or content specifically tailored to SGM participant characteristics to 
distract from cravings and will be sent based on participants’ needs. While there is strong 
evidence that text -based tobacco cessation interventions help smokers quit smoking, no similar 
intervention has been conducted specifically for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and/or transgender smokers [18- 20]. Reducing smoking prevalence among SGM individuals by [CONTACT_67940] a 
cost-effective and tailored text -based smoking cessation intervention is a powerful cancer 
prevention strategy for this population.  
 
 
OBJECTIVE  
 
The objective of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of SmokefreeSGM, an SGM - 
tailored version of the SmokefreeTXT text messaging program developed by [CONTACT_37152].  
 
 
STUDY DESIGN  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/[ADDRESS_308372] a randomized controll ed trial among 100 SGM smokers living in the United 
States randomized to the original SmokefreeTXT program (control arm = 50) or the 
SmokefreeSGM program (intervention arm = 50). Data collected will be used to examine 
recruitment, retention, and smoking abstinence rates at 1- , 3-, and 6 -months follow -up. 
Additionally, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 32 participants (control arm = 16, 
intervention arm = 16) to evaluate the acceptability of both programs among SGM smokers.

IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/[ADDRESS_308373] 2 months, ongoing angina, peptic ulcer disease, arrhythmia, or uncontrolled blood pressure. Potential contraindications include: strok e in the past 6 
months, insulin therapy, and a current diagnosis of liver, kidney, or heart disease. Study 
participants reporting a potential contraindication will require approval from their primary 
care provider and/or other treating physician (e.g., psy chiatrist) to use nicotine patches. 
If the request is denied or not returned in 2 weeks, potential study participants will be excluded from the study.

Study Procedures.  
 
Recruitment Procedures  
 
Active efforts will be made to identify subjects who are suitable for enrollment into this part of 
the study. Flyers (Appendix B) offering help to SGM individuals interested in quitting smoking will be distributed at local community organizations and healt h care facilities working for SGM 
groups. We will also advertise through the Health Equity Research Group’s (HERG) social 
media accounts (i.e., Twitter and Facebook).  
 
 
Screening Part A and B  
 
Interested individuals will contact [CONTACT_5051]. The screening process will take place over 
the phone, through telehealth (i.e., Microsoft Teams, Webex, or Zoom), or in- person, and will be 
divided into two parts. Part A of the screening will collect demographic information in addition to 
an assessment of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Appendix C). Study participants who are  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   eligible to participate will be invited to complete Part B of the screening (through telehealth or in-  
person) at a later date and time where their self -reported smoking status will be verified by a 
saliva cotinine test. The informed consent (Appendix D) and an electronic copy of the saliva test 
instructions will be delivered electronically to study participants  via email after they complete 
Part A of the screening. In an attempt to limit in- person visits, potential study participants will be 
mailed a saliva test kit (Alere or NICDetect) and a physical copy of the instructions in advance  of 
their session. In- person visits will only be conducted for study participants with inadequate 
equipment/devices to participate in telehealth sessions. Study participants will conduct the 
saliva test by [CONTACT_253473] -by-step instructions provided by [CONTACT_253474] . 
This procedure will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_253475]. The test results will be available when the colored band appears, which takes approximately [ADDRESS_308374] 
the research team after that time will be given the option to be enrolled in the SmokefreeSGM 
text-messaging program only. These individuals will not complete the screenings or 
assessments and will not be provided with nicotine patches or compensation.  
 
 
Baseline Assessment  
 
Immediately after confirming a person’s eligibility to participate in the study, they will complete the Baseline Assessment (Appendix E), which will ask additional demographic and tobacco use 
questions: sexual ori entation and gender identity, race/ethnicity, work status, marital status, 
number of children in household, and smoking behaviors (e.g., number of cigarettes smoked per day, past attempts to quit), among others.  
 
Nicotine dependence will be measured using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence 
(FTND), which is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   nicotine related to cigarette smoking. It contains six questions that evaluate the quantity of 
cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence. Yes/No items are scored from 0 to 1 and multiple- choice items are score from 0- 3. The higher the to tal score, the more intense 
the study participant’s physical dependence to nicotine. For study participants that also use 
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) also known as electronic cigarettes, vape pens, 
vapes, eHookahs, JUULS, etc; their dependence will be measured using the Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index, a 10 -item scale with scores ranging from 0 to 20. The 
higher the total score, the more intense the study participant’s dependence to ENDS.  
 
 
The study participant will then set a quit date in 15 days and be enrolled in the text messaging program. Study participants will either be assigned to the control group (SmokefreeTXT) or intervention group (SmokefreeSGM) through the randomization function in REDCap. Following 
completion o f the assessment, the study participant will be sent a $[ADDRESS_308375] via email and 
mailed a 6 -week supply of nicotine patches. The dosage of nicotine patches will be dependent 
on whether the study participant identified as a light smoker (≤ 10 cigarettes /day) or a heavy 
smoker (smoke > 10 cigarettes/day). Light smokers will receive 3 boxes of 14 mg nicotine 
patches and heavy smokers will receive 3 boxes of 21 mg nicotine patches.  
 
 
1-Month Assessment  
 
Study participants will complete the 1 -month assessmen t (Appendix F) via phone, telehealth, or 
in-person and be asked a series of demographic and tobacco use questions similar to the 
baseline screening: changes to contact [CONTACT_3031], sexual orientation and gender identity, smoking behaviors, and nicotine pat ch use. The research team member will conduct a FTND 
and/or Penn State Electronic Cigarette Dependence Index for those study participants that have 
not quit smoking. The research team member will also pose the question: “As an LGBTQ+  
smoker, do you feel that the content of the text messages was tailored to your needs? Can you  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   explain why or why not?" Following completion of the assessment, the study participant will be 
sent a $[ADDRESS_308376] via email and mailed a 2-  or 4-week supply of nicoti ne patches depending 
on if they identified as a light smoker (smoke ≤ 10 cigarettes/day) or a heavy smoker (smoke > 
10 cigarettes/day) during the baseline assessment. Light smokers will receive 1 box of 7 mg 
nicotine patches and heavy smokers will receive 1 box of 14 mg and 1 box of 7 mg nicotine 
patches.  
 
 
Individuals living in the Greater Houston Area will be given the opportunity to complete the 1-  
month assessment in- person at the University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center at Houston 
School of Public Health (RAS E515). In doing so, they will be able to complete an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) test (coVita Smokerlyzer) for additional compensation ($[ADDRESS_308377]) and 
a voucher for parking in or public transportation to the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center. Unlike saliv a 
cotinine tests, which will produce positive results for individuals who both smoke traditional 
cigarettes and use electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), the CO test will only produce 
elevated results for traditional cigarette smokers. Implementing this procedure will also allow us 
to test its feasibility before launching a larger -scale efficacy trial for the SmokefreeSGM 
program.  
 
 
3- and 6- Month Assessments  
 
Study participants will complete the 3 - and 6 -month assessments (Appendix G & H) via 
telehealth and will conduct the saliva cotinine test to verify their smoking status. Individuals 
living in the Greater Houston Area will be given the opportunity to comple te these assessments 
in-person at the University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health 
(RAS E515). In doing so, they will be able to complete an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) test 
(coVita Smokerlyzer) for additional compensation ($[ADDRESS_308378] at each assessment) and a  
voucher for parking or public transportation to the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center.  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/[ADDRESS_308379] a FTND and/or Penn State Electronic Cigarette 
Dependence Index. Following completion of the 3 - and 6 -month assessments, the study 
participant will b e sent a $20 and $[ADDRESS_308380] via email respectively.  
 
 
Semi -structured Interview  
 
32 study participants, 16 from the control group and 16 from the intervention group, will be 
invited to participate in a semi -structured interview (Appendix I) to evaluat e the acceptability of 
the programs and capture feedback that can be used to improve the design and functionality of 
SmokefreeSGM. We will ask the following questions:  
1) In what ways did your participation in the text messaging program influence your current  
smoking behaviors (i.e., currently smoking or  smokefree)?  
2) Prior to your enrollment in the text messaging program, did you use electronic nicotine 
delivery systems (e.g., electronic cigarettes, vapes, e -Hookahs, mods)? If not, what are 
your thoughts about these products? If yes, do you currently use them and how has your 
participation in this program influenced your decision to do so? 
3) What are some things that you liked about the text messaging program?  
 
4) Were there specific text messages that you liked and still resonate with you? Which 
one(s) and why? It is okay if you do not remember the exact text  message(s).  
5) What are some things that you did not like about the text messaging program?  
 
6) Were there specif ic text messages that you did not like and you believe should be 
modified or eliminated? It is okay if you do not remember the exact text  message(s).  
7) Were the response instructions in the text messages clear? Why or why  not? 
 
8) Did you find that the bidirect ional text messages, meaning the two -way conversations  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   between you and the program, were satisfactory? Why or why not?  
 
9) Was the content of the text messages clear? Why or why  not? 
 
10) After participating in this text messaging program, would you suggest it to other LGBTQ+ 
smokers interested in quitting? Why or why  not? 
11) Based on the text messages you received, do you believe that you were enrolled in the 
SmokefreeTXT program developed for the general population or the SmokefreeSGM 
program tailored to LGBTQ+ smokers? Why or why  not? 
12) Do you think that receiving text messages tailored to LGBTQ+ smokers helped or would 
have been helpful in your efforts to quit smoking? Why or why  not? 
13) Is there anything more you would like to share with me, whether about the text 
messaging program or the study?  
 
 
Following completion of this interview, study participants will be sent a $[ADDRESS_308381] via email.  
 
 
DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING  
This is a min imal risk study. The risks of using either text -based platforms, completing the 1- , 3-, 
and 6- month assessments, and participating in the structured interview are minimal and may 
result in: (1) emotional discomfort due to discussion about sensitive issues,  and (2) breach of 
confidentiality. Distress will be minimized by [CONTACT_253476]/or answer any questions during the assessments and the one -time 
individual interview that they do not feel comfortable answering and may withdraw from the 
study at any time without repercussion. Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_253477] -protecting computer files. Data will be stored on a secure server with a 
firewall to protect the data and to prevent unauthorized access. Data on the server will also be 
password protected and only accessible to research team members who have met UTHealth 
IRB’s requirements for training in Human Subjects’ Protection. All study participants will be

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/[ADDRESS_308382] (coVita Smokerlyzer) 
during the 1- , 3- and 6- month assessments,  the device mouth pi[INVESTIGATOR_253469]. No biological samples will be taken from the study participant. Results will be 
recorded from the device into the corresponding REDCap form. Additionally, the devices will be 
appropriately cl eaned and disinfected before and after each use.  
 
 
STATISTICS  
 
Quantitative data collected via text messages will be downloaded from Mosio as an Excel, SPSS, R, SAS, or STATA dataset. These software packages will be used for analysis purposes. 
Study variables will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics. The distributional characteristics of relevant variables will be examined using box plots and histograms to ensure 
normality assumptions. Routine descriptive statistics, including proportions, m eans, and 
standard deviations as well as graphical methods will be reported to explore distributions for all 
variables.  
 
Recruitment rates will be defined by [CONTACT_253478] -based program. Retention rates will be defined by [CONTACT_253479]: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   number of SGM smokers who remained in the text -based cessation program and completed the 
3- and 6- month assessments by [CONTACT_253480]. The recruitment and 
retention rates will be calculated along with confi dence intervals (CIs) for specific arms and 
combined arms.  
 
 
We will use t -test/Mann -Whitney or chi -squared/Fisher’s exact test to compare baseline 
demographic variables between SGM smokers and those who refuse to participate or drop out 
from the study. Sm oking abstinence outcomes will be defined as 7- day smoking abstinence 
along with negative saliva cotinine tests. Because abstinence is a binary variable (yes, no) the 
primary method of analysis will be a simple post -test analysis among SGM smokers with a 
generalized logistic mixed model, using a random intercept to incorporate the intra -subject 
correlation. Important covariates that will be used to adjust for potential baseline differences 
include age, level of education, biological sex, gender identity/sex ual orientation, race/ethnicity, 
marital status, working status, years smoking, nicotine dependence, use of other tobacco 
products, and living with other household members who smoke. Odds ratio (OR) of smoking 
abstinence in the intervention group (SmokefreeSGM) relative to the control group 
(SmokefreeTXT) will be used to estimate effect size. Using logistic regression, abstinence will 
be regressed onto a dummy coded SmokefreeSGM vs. SmokefreeTXT group indicator, with the 
exponentiated coefficient of the group indicator yielding the OR.  
 
Once the smoking cessation intervention concludes and in order to quantitatively assess 
engagement, a series of [ADDRESS_308383] STOP, which is used for unsubscr ibing from the program. The percentage of  
IRB NUMBER: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/[ADDRESS_308384]/Mann -Whitney to compare the average numbers 
of text messages between the two arms.  
 
 
Qualitative data from each individual interview will be analyzed for assessing feasibility and acceptability. Audio recordings from the [ADDRESS_308385]. Analysis of the transcripts will be based on data groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007], creation of a code guide, and identification of themes from the narrative text. The coding guide will be drawn on the domains shaped by [CONTACT_253481]. Data analysis will be performed using computer software (ATLAS.ti or  NVIVO).  
 
 
ETHICS  
 
This study involves no more than minimal risk to subjects. The risk of breach of confidentiality 
will be addressed by [CONTACT_253482], and that while the findings of the 
study  may be published,  they will not be identified.  Nevertheless,  this study  may benefit  others 
since this work may contribute to a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the 
acceptability of mobile health (mH ealth) smoking cessation interventions among SGM groups. 
Results will contribute to the design of interventions targeting this underserved population of smokers.  
 
 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORDING KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_253470]: HSC -SPH-22-0717 
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 07/25/2023   Study participants will be assured that information collected will be kept confidential and that 
their name [CONTACT_253483]/or publications. All data collected through REDCap instruments will only be available to research team members who 
are knowledgeable of all human subjects’ protection guidelines. Electronic datasets will be 
password protected on secure drives and only accessible to research team members.  
 
 
QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
 
Research team members involved in the study will be trained in human subjects’ research and 
good clinical practice. Research team members will be available to answer any questions that 
the study participant may have via phone, email, or telehealth. Data collection instruments (e.g., 
screening forms) from each enrolled study participant will be checked to verify that inclusion and exclusion criteria have been respected.  
 
 
PUBLICATION PLAN  
 
The data collected from this study will help address the high prevalence of cigarette smoking and tobacco -related health disparities among SGM individuals. Additionally, our findings will 
help inform future text -based smoking cessation programs for SGM groups and other 
marginalized populations as well as contribute to the body of evidence for mHealth behavioral change interventions. At least one manuscript with findings from this randomized controlled trial 
is expected to be published in a peer -reviewed journal.

Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) prosthetic joint infection is a devastating and somewhat unique
complication to shoulder arthroplasty.  It is a very slow-growing, aerotolerant anaerobic, non-
spore forming, gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria that takes up to 2-[ADDRESS_627097] peri-operative measures
typi[INVESTIGATOR_488072] - pre-operative prophylactic
antibiotics, pre-operative skin cleanse/wash, topi[INVESTIGATOR_488073] (povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine,
etc.), and intra-operative antibiotic powders.  The overall infection rate of shoulder arthroplasty
has been cited to be between 0.9-2.9%, with C. acnes being the most common bacterium in
shoulder arthroplasty periprosthetic infections.  Morbidity and cost associated with shoulder
prosthetic joint infection is extremely high, requiring multiple surgeries and months of treatment

to overcome the infection.
One of the main issues with C. acnes is its preferred location within the body, residing within
the sebaceous glands of the hair follicles, deep to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_488074]. These glands are
commonly found around the shoulder and upper back, and lead to acne.  C. acnes, along with
other common prosthetic joint infection bacteria, quickly create a biofilm which is impenetrable
to most antibiotic agents, further stressing the importance of prevention.  Recently there have
been studies analyzing the effects of Benzoyl Peroxide (BPO) on C. acnes as it relates to
shoulder arthroplasty in an attempt to reduce this bacterial burden prior to surgery.  There have
been promising results with multi-day preparation skin cleansing with benzoyl peroxide.
However, there are no studies looking at intra-operative skin incision preparations targeting the
region of skin where the C. acnes bacteria resides.  In vitro studies show SURGX antimicrobial
gel (Next Science, Jasksonville, FL) results in a marked reduction of C. acnes in addition to
other common bacteria affecting prosthetic joints.  This gel uses citric acid to chelate the
metallic bonds of biofilm.  The bacteria are then destroyed by a combination of a high
osmolarity environment coupled with a surfactant.
The first purpose of the study is to evaluate if a dermal layer preparation will reduce positive
cultures of C. acnes after primary shoulder arthroplasty.  There will be a control group
consisting of no skin preparation.  There will be two additional comparative groups.  The
second purpose of this study is to compare the use of standard povidone-iodine swab versus
SURGX antimicrobial gel as an application into the dermal layer after the skin incision has been
made with a skin knife to see if there is a reduction in bacterial burden in the superficial and
deep tissues at the end of a primary shoulder arthroplasty.  Superficial and deep cultures will be
obtained at the conclusion of the shoulder replacement surgery.  These cultures will be held in
the lab for [ADDRESS_627098] frequently

Primary objective: skin incision preparation solution intraoperatively after the skin incision has
been made will reduce the number of positive cultures after primary shoulder arthroplasty
versus no intraoperative skin incision preparation.  A control group with standard preoperative
skin prep will be included.  All patients will receive standard of care preoperative antibiotics and
preoperative skin cleansing preparation prior to drapi[INVESTIGATOR_488076].
Hypothesis: the use of skin incision preparation solution will be more effective at reducing
positive cultures compared to the control group and the SURGX antimicrobial wound gel will
result in decreased C. acnes growth from intra-operative cultures when compared to the use of
povidone-iodine.

This is a prospective, sequential assignment study in which patients will be blinded to the
intervention.  Patients will be sequentially allocated based on enrollment ID number (alternating
consecutive fashion) with every third patient in the control group (no skin incision preparation)
beginning with patient #1.  The treatment group #1 (betadine) will be every third patient

tables, charts, etc., attach those files in the Attachment section (#16).
All patients must be undergoing a primary anatomic or reverse shoulder arthroplasty.  Patients
will be screened for iodine allergies and excluded from participation if they have this allergy.
Patients will be recruited and consented preoperatively in the office prior to surgery.  There is
no standard of care in regards to which topi[INVESTIGATOR_488078], if any, in shoulder
arthroplasty.  Common agents that are frequently used for surgical preparation include
chlorhexidine and betadine (povidone-iodine).  No additional procedures will be required of the
study subjects.  All patients will receive standard pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics.  They
will all receive the same preoperative external skin preparation with Hibiclens (chlorhexadine)
and ChloraPrep (2% chlorhexadine gluconate / 70% isopropyl alcohol solution) prior to drapi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
Intra-operative irrigation will be standardized with Irrisept (chlorhexidine gluconate 0.05% in
sterile water). At the time of the surgery, after the skin incision has been made with a skin knife,
the dermal layer will either be not prepped or be prepped with povidone-iodine (treatment group
1) or SURGX antimicrobial wound gel (treatment group 2).  At the conclusion of the case, five
total cultures will be obtained.  Two will be superficial and three will be deep cultures, one of
which will be an implant swab.  These cultures will be held in the lab for [ADDRESS_627099]
completed the number of patients (20) in each group and final [ADDRESS_627100] information from medical records, as outlined in the data collection sheet.
 
      c)   If the proposed study is a clinical trial where a drug, vaccine, device or other treatment is
compared to a placebo group or comparison treatment group, what are the guidelines or
endpoints by [CONTACT_488099]? For
example, it may be reasonable to stop enrollment on a study when efficacy has already been
clearly demonstrated, to avoid unnecessary enrollments of additional subjects. Alternatively, it
may be reasonable to stop enrollment when it is clear that efficacy will never be demonstrated,
given the statistical power of the study as designed. Describe the guidelines that are in place to
assist in making these determinations, if relevant to the proposed study.
It has been reported in the literature that standard preoperative antibiotics and skin preparation
prior to drapi[INVESTIGATOR_488079].  It is not known if this will lead to an increased risk of infections long
term or if this is an incidental finding. No studies have looked at preppi[INVESTIGATOR_488080].  Theoretically, if the
bacterial burden is reduced at the time of surgery, this may reduce the risk of late term infection
if it were to occur. The control group will receive standard pre-op skin cleansing. Since the
study endpoint is presence/absence of C. acnes in the cultures, and we only plan to enroll [ADDRESS_627101] to cease enrollment early.

analysis. If none, please justify.
Statistics will be run through standard statistical programs, involving analyses that compare two
groups of results - T-test, Chi-square etc.  Our decision of sample size is based upon the
literature with prior studies including comparative treatment groups of roughly 20 patients in

deception, an alteration of consent must be justified in the Informed Consent section of the

    f)  Is there an accepted standard of care and/or standard practice at SLU for the
condition/disease/situation being studied? This information will assist in comparing
the risk/benefit ratio of study procedures relevant to usual care that would be
received outside of the research context. *?HELP?*Y
 
            If yes, please describe the standard of care and standard practice at SLU for the
condition/disease/situation being studied.
There is no standard of care in regards to skin/dermis preparation for shoulder arthroplasty at
SLU or in the field of shoulder replacement surgery.  Common skin/dermis preparations include
preoperative skin cleansers, betadine preparation, chlorhexidine skin preparation, and intra-
operative irrigation with various solutions. All patients will receive standard pre-operative
prophylactic antibiotics.  They will all receive the same preoperative skin preparation with
Hibiclens (chlorhexadine) and ChloraPrep (2% chlorhexadine gluconate / 70% isopropyl alcohol
solution) prior to drapi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Intra-operative irrigation will be standardized with Irrisept
(chlorhexidine gluconate 0.05% in sterile water).  During the study, the control group will not
receive a skin incision prep after the incision is made while the other treatment groups will
receive either povidone-iodine skin incision prep or SurgX gel prep.  We are only looking for the
presence of bacteria at the conclusion of the study.  It is not known if this bacteria is clinically
important but if present could potentially present as a late term infection.  These infections may
not present themselves for 2-[ADDRESS_627102] of care follow up
appointments with their physician which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] 2-weeks, 6-weeks, 3 months, 6 months,
and yearly (no end date) following shoulder arthroplasty. These are not part of the research
study.
 
   g)  Does this study involve any diagnostic imaging, labwork or genetic testing that could
result in clinical discovery (diagnoses, genetic mutations, etc.)? Note that this could
include discovery that is expected (related to the research) or incidental (not related
to research aims, but possible, like a mass/shadow found in imaging despi[INVESTIGATOR_488081]).Y
 
            If yes, please describe and include whether there are plans to share findings with study
participants.
We will be collecting 5 cultures per patient.  These will included 2 superficial cultures and 3
deep cultures including one of the implant.  We will hold these cultures for 2 weeks to
determine the presence of Cutibacterium acnes.  This bacteria is commonly present after
shoulder replacement surgery (up to 73% of cases), although the clinical significance is not
known.  Presence of this bacteria does not mean that the patient will develop a clinical infection
or indicate that antibiotics are needed. The purpose of the study is to see if this bacterial burden
can be reduced for the potential reduction in the risk of late term infection if they were to occur.

a) Outcome and adverse event data will be collected by [CONTACT_488116]. Any AEs/SAEs observed will be collected on the date of the patient’s surgery by [CONTACT_488117]. This would include any reaction to the application of the product
such as skin irritation, rash, or burning.  This would be treated at the time of surgery with irrigation of
the wound to flush the area and dilute the product.  If a severe case were to happen then steroid
medication would be administered.  There are no follow up appointments or study procedures after the
date of surgery included in the research study. AEs or SAEs will be recorded in a spreadsheet with
severity and causality noted. The spreadsheet will be kept on a SLU-managed computer with

10. Benefits/Alternatives
a) Benefits. Describe the potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_488119]/or society in general.  Indicate if there is no direct benefit to the
participants.
It is known that bacteria (Cutibacterium acnes) is present in up to 73% of cases after shoulder arthroplasty
is performed.  It is not known if this bacteria will increase the risk of infection late term.  The goal of this
study is to see if this bacterial presence can be reduced by [CONTACT_488120][INVESTIGATOR_488091].  The potential benefit is that if the bacterial presence is reduced or eliminated by [CONTACT_488120][INVESTIGATOR_488092] (for those subjects in treatment groups), the potential development of late term infection may be
reduced. An individual subject may or may not benefit from participation in the study. Society may benefit
from the potential knowledge gained regarding skin incision preparation as a result of this study, improving
practices for patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty.
 
b) Alternatives. Describe any alternative treatments and procedures available to the subjects should they
choose not to participate in the study. If no such alternatives exist, please state that the alternative is
nonparticipation. For some studies, such as record reviews, a description of alternatives would not be
applicable.
There is no standard skin preparation, the alternative would be nonparticipation.  Of note, povidone-iodine
and SurgX gel are available for all patients and is stocked on the shelf at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
 
11. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality and Privacy
        
Federal regulations require that research materials be kept for a minimum of three (3) years and HIPAA
documents be kept for a minimum of six (6) years after the closure of the study. For FDA-regulated or
sponsored projects, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_488093] a longer time period.
 
Confidentiality
 
         To determine whether adequate provisions for confidentiality of data are in place, the IRB must ensure that

14. Assent
     
Complete this section if your study includes minors. The Assent Form Templates (For
children and For adolescents) provide guidelines for writing the assent document.
 
       1. Will minors be asked to give assent, then consent once they reach adulthood? If not, please justify. If
not capable to provide assent initially, please address whether assent will be obtained as the minor
gains capacity. Note: children who reach the age of adulthood during participation should be given
the opportunity to provide consent as parent/guardian consent no longer applies. If obtaining consent
would be impracticable (e.g., this is a registry with data/specimen obtained long ago), a waiver of
consent should be added for IRB review. See SLU Guidelines for Research Involving Minors for
additional detail.
 
       2. If minors are asked to assent and do not wish to participate, will they still be accrued in the study? If
yes, justify.
 
       3. How will the minor's ability to give assent be assessed? (Consider the age and maturity of the minors
as well as their physical or mental condition). If capacity is fluctuating, please explain how capacity
will be assessed throughout the study.

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE  
Study purpose  To assess the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A -DP in the treatment of glabellar 
lines in comparison with placebo, including efficacy after repeat treatments and 
long term safety.  
Primary Objective  To assess the efficacy of BoNT /A-DP in reducing the severity of glabellar  
frown lines  following treatment (compared with placebo) based on investigator  
and subject  assessment  at week 4 (of the first treatment cycle) . 
Secondary Objective(s)  1. To assess the proportion of responders at maximum frown  and at rest at 
various time points after each treatment, based on investigator  and subject  
assessments . 
2. To assess onset of effect and the duration of effect (at maximum frown ) after 
a single treatment with BoNT/A -DP compared with placebo (first treatment 
cycle) , based on investigator  and subject  assessments.  
3. To provide long term safety data of BoNT/A -DP based on multiple treatment 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777578] of BoNT/A -DP treatment on subject s (in 
terms of emotional  and social functioning  and concerns relating to their 
glabellar lines ) in comparison with placebo after a single treatment.  
5. To assess subject  perceptions of effect of, and satisfa ction with, treatment in 
comparison with placebo (first treatment cycle), and during the open -label 
extension phase.  
STUDY DESIGN  
Study Type/  
Classification/ 
Discipline  Efficacy and safety  
Control Type  Concurrent (placebo)  
Study Indication Type  Treatment  
Intervention model  Parallel for first cycle, followed by [CONTACT_590272]/Masking  Double blind for first cycle, followed by [CONTACT_590273] a parallel -group, randomized, double blind , placebo -controlled 
study followed by [CONTACT_338967].  
The first treatment cycle of the study will comprise two treatment groups as 
follows:  
 Group A (active): BoNT/A -DP (20 units, 0.5 m L) 
 Group B (placebo control): sterile, 0.9% sodium chloride, (0.5 m L). 
Eligible subject s will be randomized at baseline  (day 0) to Group A or B to 
receive the first treatment in a 3:[ADDRESS_777579] 
treatment (BoNT/A -DP or placebo) and attend for visits at 1, 2 and 4 weeks 
after treatment and at 4 weekly intervals thereafter for evaluation of efficacy 
and safety (primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints are evaluated in the 
first treatment cycle in comparison with placebo).   
The first treatment cycle will last at least [ADDRESS_777580] s qualify for re -treatment (in accordance with the "eligibility for re -

treatment criteria"). After the first treatment cycle is completed, all subject s 
may enter the open label extension phase  and will be dosed with BoNT/A -DP 
(20 U) for subsequent re -treatme nts.   
Evaluation for re -treatment takes place at the earliest at [ADDRESS_777582]/previous treatment. Subjects who do not qualify for re -treatment at 
week  [ADDRESS_777583] the option (pending eligibility) of re -treatment at a later visit 
(at 4 weekly intervals thereafter) until they are eligible for re -treatment  or until 
a total of [ADDRESS_777584].  According to the study schedule ( Section 2.1 and Section 2.2), a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_777585]  (4 treatment cycles) is permitted during 
the study time frame, with treatments separated by a minimum of [ADDRESS_777586] 's 
qualification for re -treatment ; however, the last opportunity for re -treatment is 
at week 48. 
Planned Duration of  
Subject Participation  Participation is anticipated to last up to [ADDRESS_777587] s among BoNT/A -DP and 
placebo groups with a Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS) score of 0 or 1 and an 
improvement  of ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown ) at week 4 visit 
(of the first treatment cycle) relative to baseline  (responders ), based on both the 
investigator s’and the subject s’in-clinic assessments . Thus, the primary endpoint 
is a composite endpoint comprising investigator  and subject  assessments of 
treatmen t effectiveness.  
Secondary Outcome 
Measure(s)  Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Applicable for first placebo -controlled 
cycle only)  
1. The percentage of responders at maximum frown  (as defined above) at 
week 12 (after the first treatment with BoNT/A -DP or placebo).  
2. The percentage of responders at week 16 (after the first treatment).  
3. The proportion of subject s with a ≥ [ADDRESS_777588] treatment cycle, based separately on the 
investigator s’and the subject s’in-clinic assessments (applicable only for 
subject s who have a FWS score at rest ≥ 1 at baseline ). 
4. The percentage of responders at week 20 or later (after the first treatment).  
5. The extent of change in psychological impact (emotion al and social 
functioning and concerns relating to their glabellar lines ) at week 4 after 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777589] treatment, in the BoNT/A -DP group in comparison with placebo, 
relative to baseline , as assessed by [CONTACT_590274] -16 (Glabellar

6. The p roportion of responders among BoNT/A -DP and placebo groups with 
a FWS score at maximum frown  of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥ 2 points 
in FWS score (at maximum frown ) during the first treatment cycle visit 
relative to baseline , based on both the investigator s’ and the subject s’in-
clinic assessments (composite endpoint, at weeks 1, 2 and 8).  
7. The proportion of subject s with ≥ 2 -point  reduction in FWS score (at 
maximum frown ) in the BoNT/A -DP and placebo groups during the first 
treatment cycle visit relative to baseline , based on the independent rater ’s

addition, onset of effect will be assessed by [CONTACT_590275] [ADDRESS_777592] of, and satisfaction with, 
treatment in the BoNT/A -DP and placebo groups, during each treatment 
cycle, as assessed by [CONTACT_241887] -Q Satisfaction with Outcome Scale . 
10. The proportion of subject s with a > [ADDRESS_777593]

treatment cycle, based on the independent rater ’s assessment of photos.  
11. The percentage of subject s with a FWS  score of 0 or 1 and an 
improvement ≥ 2 points  in FWS score at maximum frown  (investigator  
and subject  assessment) at 4 weeks after re -treatment relative to the rating 
at the preceding end of cycle visit.  
Secondary Safety Endpoints  
1. Frequency, severity and causal relationship of adverse events (AEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest 
(AESIs) during the entire study period.  
2. Antibody formation, evaluation pre -dose before each treatment, at 4 weeks

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Sample Size Calculation  Primary Analysis:  
The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint comprising investigators  and 
subject  sassessments  of treatment effectiveness using the FWS.  Composite 
endpoint treatment success (CETS) is defined as  a ≥[ADDRESS_777601]  is a CETS “Responder” only if both investigator - and subject -rated 
success criteria are satisfied at the week 4 visit after baseline .  
The primary analysis of efficacy is the proportion of responders in the 
BoNT/A -DP treatm ent group compared with the placebo treatment group. For 
superiority testing of BoNT/A -DP compared with placebo, the following 
assumptions for the sample size calculation will be used:

Based on these assumptions, [ADDRESS_777603] s in the BoNT/A -DP arm and 14 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777604] s in total. This is a very 
small sample size and not sufficient for a detailed evaluation of the data, 
including subgroup analyses. Furthermore, the response rate could not be 
estimated with sufficient precision. A two -sided confidence interval (CI) of 
95%, and a distance from the CI limit of about 8.3% could be achieved with a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_777605] s in the BoNT/A -DP group. We propose a 3:1 
randomization of BoNT/A -DP ([ADDRESS_777606] s) to placebo ( [ADDRESS_777607] s), which 
we believe is adequate for a precise estimate of response rate and for post -hoc 
sensitivity analyses (i.e. treatment -by-center and other subgroup analyses), also 
taking into account a drop -out rate.  
In total, [ADDRESS_777608] s will be enrolled. Applying a 10% drop out rate 
would result in a total number of completing subject s of about 180. 
Analysis Data Sets  Safety Analysis Set (SAF):  
All randomized subject s who received at least one injection with study 
medication (independent of whether it is BoNT/A -DP or placebo) will be valid 
for the SAF. Within the SAF a subject  will be considered for the treatment 
actually received and not for the treatment assigned by r andomization, if 
different. The SAF will be used for the evaluation of the safety assessments.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  
The FAS includes all subject s included in the SAF . Within the FAS a subject 
will be considered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_590279], if different, i.e.  following the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
principle. The FAS will be used for the evaluation of the efficacy assessments. 
The FAS serves as the primary efficacy analysis set.  
Modified  Full Analysis Set ( MFAS):  
The MFAS includes all subject s included in the SAF who had a baseline  visit [ADDRESS_777609]  will be considered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_590280], if different, i.e . following the intent -to-treat 
(ITT) principle. The MFAS will be used for the evaluation of t he efficacy 
assessments.  
Per-protocol Analysis Set (PP):  
The PP includes all subject s who had no significant protocol deviations and an 
in-clinic assessment with the FWS by [CONTACT_590281]  (day 0) and at the  week [ADDRESS_777610] s will be 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777611] s in corresponding categories.  
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765].  
For responder analyses on the week 4 and week 12 visits, missing  in-clinic 
assessments (by [CONTACT_590282] ) with the  FWS at baseline  or at 
week [ADDRESS_777612] method, and a t ippi[INVESTIGATOR_590256].  
For patient reported outcome (PRO) instruments, missing data will be imputed 
per developer guidelines,  where these are available.  
Evaluations of subject s who started the first injection with placebo but then 
switched for further injections to BoNT/A -DP will be excluded from primary 
efficacy analyses.  
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summa rized by [CONTACT_29974] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) ( using current version of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  [MedDRA ]). The number of events, as 
well as the number and rate of affected subject s, will be reported. TEAEs (SOC 
and PT) will also be summarized by [CONTACT_12917], severity, relationship to study 
medication, and relationship to procedure.  
TEAEs will be separately analyzed as events observed on or after first 
treatment up to before the open l abel extension (first cycle), and events starting 
on or after re -treatment until end of study (open label phase). Events in subject s 
who started the first treatment with placebo but then entered the open label 
extension for re -treatment with BoNT/A -DP, will be considered to placebo for 
the first cycle and to BoNT/A -DP for the open label phase.  
Further aspects of statistical analyses will be detailed within a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP).  
Planned Statistical 
Analysis  Primary Analysis:  
The proportion of subject s (responders ) meeting the primary endpoint  with a 
FWS score of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS (at maximum 
frown ) at visit week [ADDRESS_777613]  in-clinic assessments will be analyzed using Cochran -Mantel -
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777614] (with stratification variable site) using a significance level ( ) of  
0.025. The hypothesis to be tested is:  
 H0: pBoNT/A -DP≤ p Placebo  
 H1: pBoNT/A -DP>pPlacebo  
The FAS will serve as  the primary analysis set.  
Subjects with missing  investigator s’ or subject s’ in-clinic assessments with the  
FWS at baseline  or week 4 visit will be assigned as being non -responder s. 
Additional Analyses on the Primary Endpoint Variable:  
Further analyses on the primary endpoint variable are exploratory.  
A one -sided Pearson  2-test will be applied . 
Two-sided CI of 95% for the responder rates in the BoNT/A -DP and the 
placebo treatment groups will be calculated using Wilson scores. Treatment -
by-center  interaction will be tested using the Breslow -Day test for homogeneity 
of the odds ratios. The CIs will also be calculated for the additional analyses as 
listed in the following : 
 The primary endpoint measure using the observed values only, 
i.e. missing  investigator  or the subject  in-clinic assessments with the  
FWS at baseline  or week 4 visit will be excluded from analysis , but 
not assigned as being non -responder . 
 The primary endpoint measure using the MFAS and PP. 
 The primary endpoint measure applying the LOCF for week 4 
visit.  
 Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_3725]  
 Subgroup analyses will be conducted for site s. Sites with less than 3 
placebo subjects will be combined. The 2-test will be applied for 
each subgroup. In case of a total number of observations below 30, or 
in case of at least one cell frequency below 5, Fisher’s exact test will 
be used instead of the 2-test. Stratified analyses  applying the 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test will also be conducted  using facto r 
geographic region . Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_590283]ïve subjects . 
o Subgroup analyses w ill be c onducted for subjects with 
treatmen t with any serotype of botulinum toxin for any 
indication versus naïve subjects. The 2-test or Fisher’ s exact 
  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777615] (see above corresponding criteria t o use Fis her) will be 
applied for each subgroup. No stratified analysis using factor 
pre-treated/ naïve subjects  is currently planned.  
Key Secondary Analyses:  
The testing of the [ADDRESS_777616] in the 
order showed a confirmatory resu lt at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. If 
the one -sided p -value is larger than 0.025 for any of the tests, the results of the 
subsequent tests will only be considered exploratory, and not confirmatory. The 
application of this hierarchical approach keeps the global significance level to 
0.025 one -sided and requires no further adjustment of the significance level.  
The following order of tests will be defined:  
 Primary endpoint (composite endpoint)  
 Key secondary endpoint 1  
 Key secondary endpoint 2  
 Key s econdary endpoint 3  
 Key secondary endpoint 4  
 Key secondary endpoint 5  
The same analyses, inclusive the additional exploratory analyses, as described 
for the primary endpoint , will be conducted.  
Additional Secondary Analyses:  
The additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed applying the 
appropriate statistical method for the comparison of both treatment arms. For 
proportions, t he Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test (with stratification variable site) 
as well as the  2-test will be applied. In case  of a total number of observations 
below 30, or in case of at least one cell frequency below 5, Fisher’s exact test 
will be used instead of the 2-test. The modified Skindex -16 (GL-QoL) and 
FACE -Q scale s will be analyzed according to the foreseen analysis approach of 
these tools.  
Beside s the FAS population for the analysis with multiplicity control, the 
analyses of these endpoints will also  be based on the MFAS and the PP 
population. For all analyses, a one -sided significance level of 0.025 will be 
used, if not stated otherwise .

neural transmission by [CONTACT_322538], causing muscle paralysis, 
howe
ver only serotypes A and B are used clinically1 2. The toxins are released from the 
bacteria as part of a noncovalent multimeric complex, associated with up to six auxiliary 
proteins, including haemagglutinins and a nontoxin, nonhematuglitin3.Botulinum 
neurotoxin A is synthesized as a single-chain polypeptide with a molecular weight of 
approximately 150 kDa, comprising a 100- kDa heavy chain joined by a disulfide bond  to a 
50-kDa light chain4. The heavy chain targets the toxin to specific types of axon  terminals, 
after which the toxin can be taken into neurons by [CONTACT_249426]5,6. The light chain of the 
toxin, which has zinc-dependent endoprotease activity, is then released from the 
endocytotic vesicles and reaches the cytoplasm . The light chain blocks the release of the 
neurotransmitter acetylcholine, causing dose-dependent weakening of the target muscle. 
The type A toxin proteolytically degrades its target SNAP-25 protein , which is essential for 
exocytosis of acetylcholine vesicles located in the peripheral motor neurons3,7,8. By 
[CONTACT_590286]/fusing with the nerve synapse plasma 
membrane and inhibiting acetylcholine release, the toxin interferes with nerve impulses 
and causes muscle paralysis3,[ADDRESS_777647] range of medical indications for botulinum toxin includes 
treatment of movement disorders (e.g. spasticity, cervical dystonia), urological disorders 
(e.g. overactive bladder), dermatological conditions (e.g. axillary hyperhidrosis),chronic 
migraine, as well as cosmetic applications (glabellar lines, canthal lines).  
Glabellar lines, which appear as vertical lines between the eyebrows , are caused by 
[CONTACT_322541]. These glabellar frown lines 
often become more prominent with age and can project negative emotions 
unintentionally11,12,13. In addition, the persistent presence of glabellar frown lines can be 
s
uggestive of an older than actual age, affecting an individual’s self-perception, emotional 
well-being, and perception by [CONTACT_2312], in some cases contributing to depression14,15.

in the treatment of glabellar lines in comparison with placebo for one treatment cycle and 
to evaluate long term safety and efficacy following repeated injections in the subsequent 
open label extension phase. 
4.2 Clinical Condition/Indication 
Hyperfunctional facial lines (mimic wrinkles) are common aesthetic deformities involving 
the glabellar area, forehead and perorbital area. Glabellar lines occur as a result of the pull 
on the skin on the underlying facial musculature, predominantly the procerus muscle and 
the corrugator supercilli23; the latter muscle has no essential function other than to express 
emotion. Although fine wrinkling on the upper lip and cheeks, and crow’s feet, as well as 
the deeper lines in the nasolabial area are a sign of aging, wrinkling in the glabellar area is 
associated with the expression of frowning. Excessively prominent lines in this area (which 
appear as vertical lines between the eyebrows) are often misinterpreted as anger, anxiety, 
fear, fatigue and melancholia, causing the subject considerable distress24. As a result, 
glabellar lines can negatively influence self-perception, perception by [CONTACT_590287]25,26. Although treatments are available for such lines (including topi[INVESTIGATOR_590257]), there are several disadvantages to currently available 
treatments and most facial rejuvenation procedures do not address the underlying 
musculature responsible for facial lines.  
Studies with botulinum toxin have shown that the toxin weakens the overactive underlying 
muscle contraction, causing a flattening of the facial skin and improved appearance. The 
effect of the neurotoxin on facial lines was first reported in the early 90’s.  Subsequent 
widespread use has supported its efficacy and safety for several therapeutic indications 
including facial aesthetics 10,27. Lewis and Bowler (2009)[ADDRESS_777651] BoNT/A- DP

systemic toxicity following long-term treatment has not been evaluated for the IMP. 
Reproductive toxicity was investigated in an embryo-foetal development toxicity study in 
the SD rat model, where animals were dosed at 1 to 8 U/kg for 12 days. Clinical signs

luded paralytic gait in all treatment groups, which is considered to be due to 
exaggerated pharmacologic effects of BoNT/A- DP. The NOAEL was less than 1 U/Kg. 
No 
standard pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic studies were performed with CROMA 
Pharma GmbH’s  BoNT/A- DP, since the chemical nature of the drug is a protein and the 
expected consequence of metabolism of proteins is the degradation to small peptides and

[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 3 Study HG-11-01: Indication; Glabellar Lines 
P
hase 3 study HG-11-01 was a comparative non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety and 
e
fficacy for improvement of glabellar lines of BoNT/A-DP compared to  in subject s 
with moderate to severe glabellar lines. Study HG-[ADDRESS_777656] s receiving BoNT/A-DP and [ADDRESS_777657] 
was 
administered at a dose of 20 U (0.5 mL). 
The
 primary endpoint was the response rate of physicians' assessment using the Facial 
Wrinkle Scale (FWS) at week 4. Secondary endpoints included the response rate according 
to investigator at weeks 8, 12 and 16, photographic assessment (3 independent blinded 
raters) at weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16, subjects' improvement assessment and subjective 
self-satisfaction levels. 

  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777658] and control groups at 6 and 24 weeks after administration and comparison of 
changes in PRS, Passive Range of Motion Scale (ankle dorsifelxion [ DF], knee flexion), 
Gross Motor Function Measure-88, Gross Motor Function Measure-66 and Modified 
Tardieu Scale (ankle DF) between the test and control groups at 6, 12 and 24 weeks after 
administration. 
The responder rate was 60.27% (44/73 subjects) in the BoNT/A- DP group compared to 
61.43% (43/70 subjects) in the group. Moreover, the lower limit of 95% CI for the 
between-group difference in responder rates (-1.15%) was 17.16%, which was higher than 
the non-inferiority margin of-24.00%, demonstrating that BoNT/A- DP was not inferior to 
. Among the secondary endpoints, no statistically significant difference was noted 
between the BoNT/A- DP group and the  group.  
A 
total of [ADDRESS_777659] s (73.97%) in the BoNT/A- DP group and 
[ADDRESS_777660] s (64.29%) in the  group, with no statistically 
significant difference between groups.  
A total of five SAEs were reported in four subject s in the BoNT/A- DP group (including 1 
case of severe intussusception and moderate cases of tonsillar hypertrophy, asthma, 
bronchitis and pharyngotonsillitis), all of which were unrelated to BoNT/A- DP and 
recovered without sequelae. In the  group, nine SAEs were reported in six subjects , 
(including one case of acute tonsillitis, osteochondrosis and meningitis and six cases of 
moderate pneumonia), all of which were unrelated to  and recovered without 
sequelae. Antibody formation test results pre- and post-dose were negative. 
Therefore, for the treatment of equinus foot deformity in children with cerebral palsy,the 
r
esponder rate in the BoNT/A- DP group was comparable to that of the  group; 
BoNT/A-DP was not inferior to  and there were no statistically significant 
differences in AE frequency between both treatment groups.

the control group. The difference in variation between treatment groups was -0.06 (95% 
2-sided CI [-0.23, 0.12], hence the upper limit of the 95% 2-sided CI (0.12) was below the 
non-inferiority margin set for this study (0.5), thus verifying that BoNT/A- DP was not 
inferior to the comparator, . The inter-group difference in MAS variation at all time 
points (all p>0.05) was not statistically significant. Also, there was no statistically 
s
ignificant difference in the distribution of global assessment of improvement between 
treatment groups at each time point (p>0.05). In both groups, the Caregiver Burden Scale 
sc
ore decreased significantly from baseline after treatment (p< 0.01).  
The proportion of subjects who experienced an AE after IMP administration was 20.00% 
(19/95 subjects, 23 events) in the test group and 25.00% (23/92 subjects, 28 events) in the 
 control group, while adverse drug reactions were reported at a frequency of 2.11% 
(2/95 subjects, two events) in the test group and 1.09% (1/92 subjects, one event) in the 
c
ontrol group. A total of six SAEs were reported in six subjects, three in the BoNT /A-DP 
group (branchial cyst, oedema peripheral and back pain) and three in the  group 
(tuberculous pleurisy, facial injury and muscle spasticity), which were mild or moderate in 
severity and were considered unrelated to the IMP . No clinically significant difference s 
were observed between treatment groups with respect to laboratory tests, vital signs or 
physical examination and no antibody formation was reported. 
The study therefore demonstrated that BoNT/A-DP was not inferior to  for muscle 
tone improvement efficacy in subjects with post-stroke upper limb spasticity. Comparative 
equivalence in safety was also demonstrated, indicating that BoNT/A-DP is safe and 
effective for the treatment of post-stroke upper limb spasticity. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 4Study HG-BTBPS-[ZIP_CODE]: Indication; Blepharospasm 
S
tudy HG-BTBPS-[ZIP_CODE] was a P hase 4 open -label, single -group, multi -cente r trial which 
was conducted after the approval of BoNT/A -DP (Botulax) in Korea.  Subject s were 
included who were diagnosed with essential blepharospasm  and had a spasm severity of 
2~4 (according to Scott’s method). The f ull analysis set comprised [ADDRESS_777666]  and was adapted based on the 
s
everity of spasms and symptoms.  

  
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777667] s with an improvement of one grade in 
severity of spasm (Scott’s method) at week [ADDRESS_777668] treatment and included the following: the duration of treatment 
effect, changes of severity of spasms, rate of subject s with grade [ADDRESS_777669] s with an improvement of one grade in 
severity of spasm (Scott’s method) at week4 post-treatment was met by 87 of 91 (95.6%) 
subject s in the per protocol data set. Response to BoNT/A-DP treatment was non-inferior 
to results from other botulinum toxin A products, assuming a reference value of 92.28%, a 
non-
inferiority margin of -10% and a 95% CI. Of the [ADDRESS_777670] s included in the per 
protocol (PP) analysis, [ADDRESS_777671] s (89.01%) were retreated with the IMP. The mean 
duration of drug effect was 108.53 (±1.65) days. A total of [ADDRESS_777672] s (75.82%) showed 
an improvement to grade 0 or 1 and an improvement in severity of spasm of up to two 
grades.  
Among the full analysis set (FAS), which included [ADDRESS_777673] s (40.59%). Among these,[ADDRESS_777674] s (22.77%) were classified as 
related to the study drug. Only 1 AE (1.64%) was evaluated as grade 2 in severity, while 
the remaining 60 AEs (98.36%) were judged as grade 1. Physical examination showed [ADDRESS_777675] suffered abdominal pain 
and was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590260]. 
The results of this Phase 4 study confirm the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP in 
treatment of subjects with blepharospasm, consistent with the results of the Phase 3 study 
(HG-06-01) and the extension study (HG-01-08).

Safety data from Korea for the period March 17th [ADDRESS_777697] -marketing drug 
use investigation and phase 4 clinical trials. All subjects fulfilled the minimum data 
requirements for case safety reporting (identifiable patient and reporter, suspected 
drug product, adverse event suspected to be due to drug product). These safety data 
include eighteen unexpected adverse events (2 cases of back pain, 1 case each of 
mouth corner droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], surgical site reaction, skin ulceration, blepharospasm, 
conjunctival diso rder, purpura, blepharitis, asthenopia, photopsia, sepsis, joint 
crepi[INVESTIGATOR_332], joint lock, dyspepsia, food poisoning, joint dislocation, and Meig's 
syndrome) were reported. In addition, unexpected adverse drug reactions (3 cases 
each of bruise and visual im pairment and 1 case each of skin disease, eyelid skin 
disorder, skin ulceration, and Asthenopia) were observed. For this unexpected adverse 
event of mouth corner droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], a causal relationship was not assessed, but it is 
known that careful selection of ad ministration sites can prevent such mouth corner 
droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Causal relationship between bruise and administration of this product was

4.5 Study Rationale 
As outlined in the Clinical Summary (Section 4.4.2 ), BoNT /A- DP should be a 
valuable option for the treatment of glabellar lines and other indications. BoNT/A-DP 
ha
s been shown to be safe and well tolerated when administered at doses up to 360 U, 
which is well a
bove the 20 U dose planned for use in this study. The current Phase 3 
stud
y is designed as a randomized double blind study to assess the efficacy and safety 
of BoNT/A-DP in the treatment of glabellar lines in comparison with placebo, 
followed by [CONTACT_590297]. Data obtained from this study (and from BLESS I) will provide 
evidence of efficacy and subject safety in a controlled clinical trial and will be used 
for registration purposes. The dose rationale for this study is described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Design Ju
stification 
This will be a multicenter, double blind, placebo-controlled study, followed by [CONTACT_590298]. The study will take place in the US.  
To 
allow all subject s to profit from treatment and to obtain adequate safety data for 
BoNT/A-DP treatment, the study will be comprised of two  parts. The first part will 
comprise a double blinded treatment cycle comparing BoNT/A-DP with placebo 
(ratio 3: 1 respectively) and will be used for the determination of primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints. The 3:1 ratio was selected to increase the number of 
subjects on active IMP, thus extending the safety database and still providing a 
sufficient number of placebo subjects for relevant comparisons in efficacy and safety. 
The second part of the study will be an open label safety extension, in which all 
subjects (regardless of initial treatment group assignment) will receive BoNT/A-DP, 
to assess long term safety of the treatment and efficacy after repeat treatments. 
A 
total of [ADDRESS_777702]-hoc sensitivity analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Justification for Schedule 
The study schedule includes a maximum of four permitted treatments per subject(four 
treatment cycles), separated by a minimum interval of [ADDRESS_777703] has been 
reported to be 85 days (12.1 weeks)31and this treatment interval has been evaluated in 
several repeat treatment studies32,33.  
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777704] 2016 
 
 
 
 
  
 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
However, since treatment duration of 120 days34, 17.1± 6.[ADDRESS_777705] s can obtain 
re-treatment when they qualify (according to the "Eligibility Criteria for Re-
treatment" Section 7.3), which can be at week [ADDRESS_777706] of BoNT/-DP will be evaluated in 
the first treatment cycle compared with placebo. The duration of effect of BoNT/-DP 
after repeat treatment will be assessed in the open label extension study. The duration 
of effect has been reported to increase with repeat treatment37. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Justification 
The dose selected is 20 U, where 1U is defined as "the calculated median 
intraperitoneal lethal dose (LD 50) in mice". Study HG-11-01 performed in 
South Korea demonstrated that a dose of 20 U BoNT/A-DP per treatment was safe 
a
nd highly efficacious in the treatment of glabellar lines, with reported responder rates 
similar to those of 
the  comparator product administered at the same dose 
(20 U). The potency units of botulinum toxins for injection are specific to the 
pr
eparation and assay methods utilized and are not interchangeable with other 
preparations38(historical data with similar products have confirmed the efficacy of a 
20 U dose and current safety recommendations favour the use of such small 
doses39;FDA Guidance for Upper Facial Lines). 
4.[ADDRESS_777707] 
The
 benefit of participation in this study is the expected reduction in the severity of 
glabellar frown lines after treatment with BoNT/A-DP. Since the subject s recruited 
are also negatively impacted psychologically by [CONTACT_590299], it is anticipated 
that treated subject s will benefit in terms of quality of life (emotional and social 
functioning; improved self-perception). Subjects receiving placebo for the first 
treatment cycle will benefit from free medical screenings and follow-up provided to 
a
ll study subject s and will benefit from treatment when they enter the open label 
study.  
4.6.2 Possible Risks/Inconveniences for the Subject 
B
otulinum toxin drug products present a unique set of safety concerns related to the 
potential for local and distant spread of toxin effect. Therefore, an active evaluation of 

. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777708] (AESIs , please see 
Section 11.1). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], speech or swallowing difficulties can also result, which 
c
ould be life threatening, however no definitive SAE reports of distant spread of toxin 
effect associated with cosmetic or dermatologic use of botulinum toxin at the labeled 
dose of 20 U (for glabellar lines) or 100 U (for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis) 
have been reported to date. Baseline physical examinations will also be conducted to 
rule out pre-existing neurological or muscular deficiencies. In addition, key safety 
measures such as vital signs and pregnancy tests (where appropriate) will be 
conducted at suitable intervals to ensure no participating subjects are pregnant. 
As is the case with all injected products, injection site reactions such as pain, 
tenderness, redness, induration and/or swelling may occur after administration. In 
a
ddition, a number of other symp toms have been experienced by [CONTACT_590300] s 
including pruritus, hypertonia, ptosis, headache, diplopia, edema and blurred vision. 
The
 most frequently observed injection site reactions were injection site pain and 
swelling. The vast majority of AEs were rated as mild. 
In addition, as with any IMP, there may be unforeseeable risks associated with the use 
of BoNT/A-DP or placebo control. As a side effect of drawing blood, pain, 
he
matoma, and in very rare cases an infection at the venipuncture site may occur.

5.1
 Study Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP in the 
treatment of glabellar lines in comparison with placebo, including efficacy after repeat 
treatments and long term safety. 
5.2 Primary Objective 
To assess the efficacy of BoNT/A-DP in reducing the severity of glabellar frown lines 
following treatment (compared with placebo) based on investigator and subject 
assessment. 
5.[ADDRESS_777710] (at maximum frown) after a 
single treatment with BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo (first treatment cycle), 
based on investigator and subject assessments. 
3. To provide long term safety data of BoNT/A-DP based on multiple treatment 
cycles and to establish a sufficient safety database to support regulatory approval. 
4. To a ssess the psychological impact of BoNT/A-DP treatment on subject s (in terms 
of emotional and social functioning and concerns relating to their glabellar lines ) 
in comparison with placebo after a single treatment. 
5. To assess subject perceptions of effect of, and satisfaction with, treatment in 
comparison with placebo (first treatment cycle) and during the open-label 
e
xtension phase.

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777711] part of the study is 
a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase which aims to demonstrate 
efficacy and safety of BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo. The second part is an 
open label extension phase to evaluate efficacy after repeat treatments and long term 
safety.  
Subjects can receive a maximum of four treatment cycles over the duration of the 
study, a single treatment in the first cycle compared with placebo, and up to three 
subseque
nt treatments in the open label extension study. 
Based on historical data with similar products, it is anticipated that there will be a 
significant difference in responder rates between BoNT/A-DP and placebo in the first 
treatment cycle11,40,[ADDRESS_777712] treatment cycle of the study will comprise two treatment groups as follows:  
 Group A (active): BoNT/A-DP (20 units, 0.5 mL). 
 Gr oup B (placebo control): sterile, 0.9% sodium chloride(0.5 mL ). 
Eligible subject s will be randomized at baseline (day 0) to Group A or B to receive

 Randomization and Blinding 
6.5.1 Randomization 
This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety clinical 
study followed by [CONTACT_338967]. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 
receive either BoNT/A-DP or placebo at a ratio of 3:[ADDRESS_777738] 
treatment cycle. The 3:1 ratio in favor of active treatment versus placebo has been 
se
lected to increase the safety data base. 
Randomization will be performed per study site via interactive web response system 
(IWRS). One unique randomization code will be assigned to each subject. 
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777739] placebo controlled treatment cycle (the double-blind cycle of this trial), 
BoNT /A-DP and placebo will be provided to the sites in glass vials. Since 
BoNT/A- DP-vials contain a pellet of lyophilized BoNT/A- DP, they can be discerned 
fr
om placebo-vials (empty vials).However, after reconstitution by [CONTACT_590303]
m member at the site, both will look identical (clear solution, comparable volume), 
thus maintaining the blind. The unblinded study team member preparing the IMP at 
the 
study site must not, by [CONTACT_61076], be involved in any other study data collection 
activities including AE assessment, case report form ( CRF ) completion, diary 
collection etc. IMP will be assigned to the subjects by [CONTACT_590304] 
(blinded medication number and batch/lot number during the double-blind phase of 
the study at the given site). Once a subject has entered the open label extension, this 
unblinded study team member can then be involved in data collection activities with 
regard to that particular subject. The assigned vial will be reconstituted and will be 
forwarded to the investigator for injection. Specific Blinding Plans will be created at 
e
ach study site during the Study Initiation visits, defining the Unblinded Study Team 
a
nd the process of maintaining the blind by [CONTACT_590305]. 
6.5.3 Unblinding 
The decision to unblind lies fully with the investigator. The randomization assignment 
should not be revealed before the study has been completed and the database has been 
cleaned and closed. The study will be unblinded using the Study Specific Unblinding 
Procedure (an unblinding module is standard on all blinded studies; also it is possible 
to grant access to regulatory unblinding users so that they can monitor the safety of 
the study, if required). 
In case of emergency, the IMP administered to the subjects c an be revealed using 
the unblinding function of the IWRS. 
In rare emergencies , unblinding may be necessary for the clinical management of an 
AE. Investigators should consider unblinding only if knowledge of the administered 
product will have an influence on the further treatment of the AE. In such events, the 
investigator should make every attempt to inform the Sponsor before breaking the 
blind or as soon as possible after unblinding has been performed. The  or 
CROMA medical team is available to discuss any unblinding need. However, such 
discussion is not mandatory. The investigator can always unblind as per his/her 

.

the study, IMP can be handled by [CONTACT_590310]. IMP 
must be dispensed only at the study site as specified in the protocol (see Section 8.3). 
R
ecords will be maintained that include the subject identification code (SIC), the 
dispensation date and amount of IMP dispensed. The IMP must be dispensed only at 
the 
institution specified for each site. After reconciliation by [CONTACT_24653], all 
remaining unused unreconstituted IMP will be returned to the Sponsor, or destroyed 
a
t site with the permission of the Sponsor, in accordance with applicable law and 
study site procedures. Partially used reconstituted IMP will be destroyed after use 
(e.g. autoclaved, treated with hypochlorite or discarded in appropriate containers and 
disposed of as medical biohazardous waste). If unused unreconstituted IMP is to be 
de
stroyed by [CONTACT_779], the investigator will provide documentation in accordance with 
S
ponsor’s specifications.

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777760] who provides informed consent (i.e. signs and dates the ICF ) and has 
been proven eligible during screening will be considered enrolled in the study. Study 
procedures cannot commence until the subject has undergone the informed consent 
process and signed th e ICF. 
Ef
forts will be made to include subject s with a diversity of Fitzpatrick skin types.

A SIC will automatically be assigned by [CONTACT_590311], which will 
comprise B2 (denoting the Bless II study), followed by a single digit country 
identific
ation, a two digit site identification and a three digit subject identification 
number. All study documents (e.g. CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, 
drug accountabili
ty logs, etc.) will be identified with the SIC. An abbreviated SIC 
containing only the 3-digit subject number is acceptable, when the country identifier 
a

9.3 Screening and Study Visits 
The
 study site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes 
all subjects screened. The log will also serve to document the reason for screening 
failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of 
screening outcome. 
The overall study design is illustrated in Section 2.2. Details on the procedures to be 
performed at each study visit, including screening are listed in Table 9-1 be low and 
are listed in Section 2.1 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and in 
Section 11.15 Clinical Laboratory Tests.

10. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
10.1 Assessment of Glabellar Line Severity: Facial Wrinkle Scale 
In accordance with FDA Guidelines for Upper Facial Lines, efficacy will be 
determined using well defined, valid and reliable clinician-reported and 
subject-reported assessments, capable of measuring the critical outcomes that 
contribute to a conclusion of overall success or failure. For both investigator and 
subject assessment,  measurements will be made at maximum frown (which represents 
the worst appearance of upper facial lines with maximum load on the muscle) and at 
rest (which represents the best appearance of upper facial lines with the least load on 
the muscle), which allows one to impute benefit when the face is in dynamic motion 
(variable load on the muscle).  
The scale used most frequently in clinical studies is the FWS, which is a four-point 
rating scale
 as follows: 0 = no facial wrinkles; 1 = mild facial wrinkles; 2 = moderate

tra
ining before trial initiation and will receive training certification. Investigators will 
also have an FWS completion manual: ‘Glabellar Line Scale – Investigator: 
C
ompletion Manual’. Subject FWS assessment must be performed independently of 
the investigator and ideally before the investigator FWS assessment, to rule out any 
influence or bias from the investigator. The date and time of assessment will be 
recorded for each visit in the double blind cycle and for the week 4 visits during the 
open label cycles.

11.5.1 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator is obliged to assess the relationship between the IMP as well as study 
procedure and the occurrence of each AE/AESI/SAE. This relationship will be classed 
as not related, unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely related as follows: 
 Not r elated (both circumstances must be met): 
 Is due to underlying or concurrent illness, complications, 
concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs. 
 Is not associated with the IMP or study procedure (i.e. does not 
follow a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of 
IMP or has a much more likely alternative etiology). 
 Unlikel y related (either one or both circumstances are met): 
 Has little or no temporal relationship to the IMP or study 
procedure. 
 A more likely alternative etiology exists.  
 P ossibly related (both circumstances must be met): 
 F
ollows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of 
IMP. 
 An alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to the IMP or study procedure. 
 P robably related (both circumstances must be met): 
 Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of 
IMP, which may include but is not limited to the following: 
o Reappearance of a similar reaction upon re-administration 
(positive re-challenge). 
o P
ositive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc.). 
o Toxic level of the IMP as evidenced by [CONTACT_590320]. 
 Another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely 
 De finitely related:

 Has clear and undoubted relationship to the administration of IMP. 
The investigator will use his/her clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alter
native causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to IMP 
administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult 
the IB in the determination of his/her assessment. 
F
or the purpose of expedited regulatory reporting, events assessed as possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to IMP or study procedure will be considered as drug 
related.  
11.5.2 Assessment of Severity 
The following definitions for rating severity will be used: 
 Mi ld:  
 The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity. 
 Moder ate:  
 The AE interferes with daily activity but the subject is still able to 
function. 
 S evere:  
 The AE is incapacitating and/or requires medical intervention.

for any SAEs. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations may be performed 
to ensure that an AE has fully resolved.  
 
AEs, AESIs, and SAEs ongoing at End of Study will be followed up until the event is 
resolved or stable.  
 
Adve
rse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Whenever possible, a specific disease or syndrome, 
rather than individual associated signs and symptoms, should be identified by [CONTACT_941] 
i
nvestigator and recorded on the CRF. However, if an observed or reported sign or 
symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_1275], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF.

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777814] medical terminology should be used in order to 
avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see Section 11.1 ). Each 
AE will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1732]:

 Outc ome. 
 Ac tion taken  with study drug. 
If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the AE 
will be reported in an additional row in the AE log (or additional AE page) with 
complete information (i.e. start and stop date, severity, relationship, outcome etc.).

minimal information to include in the initial SAE/AESI report to CROMA Pharma 
GmbH, or their representative. However, it is very important that the investigator 
always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to transmission of the 
SAE/AESI report form. Minimum criteria are identifiable subject (number), a suspect 
product (i.e. IMP or concomitant medication), an identifiable reporting source 
(investigator/study-site identification) and an event or outcome that can be identified 
as serious or as an AESI. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_590265]-up information, amending the SAE/AESI report form accordingly.

be administered. Pregnant subjects will be followed-up until the end of the current 
injection cycle and will then be withdrawn from the study. At the end of the injection 
cycle, an End of Study visit will be conducted. Following detection of pregnancy, no 
invasive assessments must be conducted in pregnant women including no blood 
sampling for e.g. safety laboratory assessments or antibodies. The treatment code for 
pregnant women will be unblinded.

Full physical exam will include neurological assessment (including extraocular 
moveme
nts and cranial nerves) as well as assessment for muscle weakness.  In 
addition, if the subject reports an Adverse Event of Special Interest (as detailed in the 
AESI Manual) a focused p hysical examination by [CONTACT_099], to evaluate these 
symptoms will also be undertaken. Any clinically relevant abnormal finding will be 
documented in the CRF as AE/medical history.

and urine dip-stick pregnancy tests will be performed before re-treatment. 
Pregnancy tests may be performed at more regular intervals per local regulatory 
requirements. 
11.13 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include pulse rate (beats/min), and systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure (mmHg). Vital signs will be measured at screening, at each visit involving 
IMP administration (to be recorded before IMP administration, i.e. baseline for the 
first treatment cycle and end of cycle visit before re-treatment), at the visit 4 weeks 
after treatment and at the end of the study. Vital sign values will be recorded on the 
CRF .

aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, gamma glutamyltranspeptidase, creatinine, 
cholesterol and glucose (random). Testing of the blood samples will be performed at 
the central laboratory.  
11.15.[ADDRESS_777825] 
Serum samples will be tested for the presence of antibodies to botulinum toxin using 
an Anti Drug Antibody (ADA) ELISA assay; initially only the last sample obtained 
from each study subject will be analyzed together with the pre-dose baseline sample. 
If a sample tests positive for anti-drug antibodies, the other samples from the subject 
will be analyzed to determine when antibodies developed. Serum samples which test 
positive for binding antibodies will subsequently be tested for neutralizing activity. 
Blood serum for ADA tests will be collected at screening, at the visit 4 weeks after 
tre
atment and at the end of cycle visit for each treatment cycle and will be stored for 
future analysis should the need arise, based upon the presence of ADA at the end of 
the study. Sample storage at -80°C is preferable, but samples can be stored at -20°C at 
sites if -80°C storage is not available. Samples will be stored (at .) until 
completion of the trial and will be destroyed thereafter.

12. STA TISTICS 
12.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
Primary Analysis: 
The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint comprising investigator and subject 
assessments of treatment effectiveness using the FWS.  Composite endpoint treatment 
success (CETS)  is defined as ≥[ADDRESS_777829] is a CETS 
“Responder” only if both investigator- and subject-rated success criteria are satisfied 
at the visit 4 weeks after baseline.  
The primary analysis of efficacy is the proportion of responders in the BoNT/A-DP 
treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group. For superiority testing of 
BoNT/A-DP compared with placebo, the following assumptions for the sample size 
calculation will be used: 
Item  Assumption  Comme nts 
Underlying test  Fisher’s Exact Test  Standard test for a response parameter 
for small numbers

Based on these assumptions, [ADDRESS_777831] s in the BoNT/A-DP arm and [ADDRESS_777832] s in total. This is a very small sample size 
and not sufficient for a detailed evaluation of the data, including subgroup analyses.

Furthermore, the response rate could not be estimated with sufficient precision. A 
two-sided CI of 95%, and a distance from the CI limit of about 8.3% could be 
achieved with a sample size of [ADDRESS_777834] s in the BoNT/A-DP group. We propose a 
3:1 randomization of BoNT/A- DP (135 subj ects) to placebo (4 5 subjects), which we 
believe is adequate for a precise estimate of response rate and for post-hoc sensitivity 
analyses (i.e. treatment- by-center and other subgroup analyses), also taking into 
account a drop-out rate. 
I
n total, [ADDRESS_777835] s will be enrolled. Applying a 10% drop out rate would

 Data Sets and Analysis Cohorts 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF): 
All randomized subject s who received at least one injection with study medication 
(independent of whether it is BoNT/A-DP or placebo) will be valid for the SAF. 
Within the SAF, a subj ect will be considered for the treatment actually received and 
not for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_17628], if different. The SAF will be used for 
the evaluation of the safety assessments. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): 
The FAS includes all subjects included in the SAF. Within the FAS, a subject will be 
c
onsidered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_590324], if different, i.e. following the intent- to-treat (ITT) principle. The 
FAS will be used for the evaluation of the efficacy assessments. The FAS serves as 
the primary efficacy analysis set. 
Modified Full Analysis Set (MFAS): 
The FAS includes all subject s included in the SAF who had a baseline(visit 1 at 
day 0) and at least one post-dose in-clinic assessment with the FWS by [CONTACT_590325] 1, [ADDRESS_777836] 
will be consi
dered for the treatment assigned by [CONTACT_590279], if different, i.e. following the intent- to-treat (ITT) 
principle. The MFAS will be used for the evaluation of the efficacy assessments.  
. 
BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777837] 2016 
 
 
 
 
  
 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
 
Per-protocol Analysis Set (PP): 
The PP includes all subject s who had no significant protocol deviations and an in-
clinic assessment with the FWS by [CONTACT_590326] (day 0 ) 
and at the week [ADDRESS_777838] s will  be assigned to the treatment 
actually received. The PP will only be analyzed for main efficacy outcome measures. 
Data Review Mee
ting: 
Subject s will be assigned to the SAF, FAS, MFAS and PP during a data review 
meeting (DRM). Further details on the analysis sets, criteria for the PP, and the DRM 
will
 be specified within the statistical analysis plan (SAP).Details for and decisions on 
protocol deviations will be specified in a classification meeting taking place between 
database lock and unblinding. Corresponding documentation should be held outside 
of the SAP. 
12.3 Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data 
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_765]. For responder analyses on visits at week 4 and 
w
eek 12, missing in- clinic assessments (investigator or the subject ) with the FWS at 
baseline or week 4 and week 12 visits will be assigned as being non-responders. 
As 
sensitivity analyses, the following additional approaches for handling of missing 
values will be applied: 
 Ana lysis on observed values only, i.e. missing values will be excluded from 
a
nalysis.

12.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
Primary Analysis:

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777839] s (responders) meeting the primary endpoint with a FWS 
score of 0 or 1 and an improvement ≥ 2 points in FWS score (at maximum frown) at 
we
ek [ADDRESS_777840] (with 
stratification variable site; small sites with less than 3 placebo subjects will be 
combined ) using a significance level ( ) of 0.025. The hypothesis to be tested is: 
 H 0: pBoNT/A- DP≤ p Placebo  
 H 1: pBoNT/A- DP>pPlacebo 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test will be applied using SAS procedure Proc Freq. 
(using
 the General Association Statistic ). The one-sided p-value will be derived by 
[CONTACT_590327]-sided p-value delivered by [CONTACT_590328]. Superiority of 
B
oNT/A- DP over placebo will only be concluded if, besides statistical significance 
(one-sided p-value ≤0.025), the proportion of responders in the BoNT/A- DP treatment 
group is higher than for the placebo treatment group. 
The FAS will serve as the primary analysis set. 
Subjects with missing investigator or subject in-clinic assessments with the FWS at 
baseline or visit week 4 will be assigned as being non-responders. 
Add
itional Analyses on the Primary Endpoint Variable: 
Further analyses on the primary endpoint variable are exploratory. A one-sided 
Pearson 2-test will be applied. Two-sided CI of 95% for the responder rates in the 
BoNT/A- DP and the placebo treatment groups will be calculated using Wilson scores. 
Treatment- by-center interaction will be tested using the Breslow-Day test for 
homogeneity of the odds ratios.The CIs will also be calculated for the additional 
analyses as listed in the following: 
 The  primary endpoint measure using the observed values only, i.e. missing 
investigator or the subject in- clinic assessments with the FWS at baseline or 
week 4 visit will be excluded from analysis but not assigned as being 
non-responders. 
 The primary endpoint measure using the MFAS and the PP. 
 The  primary endpoint measure applying the LOCF for week 4 visit. 
 S ubgroup analysis by [CONTACT_3725].  
o S ubgroup analyses will be conducted for sites. Sites with less than 3 
placebo subjects will be combined. The 2-test will be applied for each

BoNT/A- DP Page [ADDRESS_777841] one cell frequency below 5, Fisher’s exact test will be 
used instead of the 2-test.  Stratified analyses applying the Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test will also be conducted using factor geographic 
region.  . 
 S ubgroup analysis by [CONTACT_1130] s with previous use of botulinum toxin versus 
naïve subjects. 
o S ubgroup analyses will be conducted for subjects with treatment with 
any serotype of botulinum toxin for any indication versus naïve 
subjects. The 2-test or Fisher’s exact test (see above corresponding 
criteria to use Fisher) will be applied for each subgroup. No stratified 
analysis using factor pre-treated/naïve subjects is currently planned. 
12.4.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
Key Secondary Analyses: 
The testing of the [ADDRESS_777842] in the order showed a 
confirmatory result at a one-sided significance level of 0.025. If the one-sided p-value 
is larger than 0.025 for any of the tests, the results of the subsequent tests will only be 
considered exploratory, and not confirmatory. The application of this hierarchical 
approach keeps the global significance level to 0.025 one-sided and requires no 
further adjustment of the significance level. 
The following order of tests will be defined: 
 P rimary endpoint (composite endpoint) 
 Ke y secondary endpoint 1 
 Ke y secondary endpoint 2 
 Ke y secondary endpoint 3 
 3.1: The investigator’s in-clinic assessments 
 3.2: The subject’s in - clinic assessments

Analysis of key secondary endpoint 5: The extent of change in psychological impact 
(emotional and social functioning, and concerns relating to glabellar lines) at week [ADDRESS_777849] treatment, in the BoNT/A-DP group in comparison with placebo, 
relative to baseline, as assessed by [CONTACT_590274]-16 (GL-QoL) and the FACE-

praisal of Lines Between Eyebrows and FACE- Q Age Appraisal VAS. 
The modified Skindex-16 (GL-QoL) and FACE-Q Appraisal of Lines Between 
Eyebrows scale and FACE-Q Age Appraisal VAS will be analyzed according to the 
foreseen analysis approach of these tools, as described below. 
Emotional and Social Functioning 
The modified Skindex-16 (GL-QoL) Emotional and Social Functioning domains and 
overall scores will be derived in accordance with the Skindex-16 manual, adapted for 
the GL-QoL. The scores will be standardized on a scale from 0 (no impact) to 100 
(maximal impact); a scale score is the average of responses to items addressing a 
construct. Domain and overall scores will be calculated if at least two of each of three 
domain items are present. The absolute change from baseline (measured on the 
screening visit) will be calculated for the domain and overall scores and statistically 
compared between the treatment groups using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (or t-test). 
Estimates of ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, and ‘severe’ psychological impact, and of the 
minimal clinical important difference, will be used to aid interpretation of scores.  
The
 analysis will be conducted with respect to the hierarchical order of key secondary 
endpoints; the analysis using the Emotional domain first, the Social Functioning 
domain second, and the overall score third. All analyses will be conducted on 
obser
ved values only, i.e. missing domain and overall scores will be excluded from 
analysis; no imputation of missing domain and overall scores will be performed.

Subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_3725], or by [CONTACT_590330]ïve subjects will not be conducted. 
Add
itional Secondary Analyses: 
The additional secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed applying the appropriate 
statistical method for the comparison of both treatment arms. For proportions, the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (with stratification variable site) and the Pearson 2-
test will be applied. In case of a total number of observations below 30, or in case of 
at least one cell frequency below 5, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead of the 2-
test. Two-sided 95% CIs for response rates will be calculated, where appropriate. 
Additionally the cumulative proportions of effects at weeks 1, 2, and 4 will be 
calculated. 
All endpoints, with exception of “responder” [ADDRESS_777851] treatment cycle only. The analysis of “responder” [ADDRESS_777852] (using

will be separately analyzed for each open label extension cycle. 
Besides the FAS population for the analysis with multiplicity control, the analyses of 
these endpoints will also be based on the MFAS and the PP population. For all 
analyses, a one-sided significance level of 0.025 will be used, if not stated otherwise. 
Additional exploratory subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_3725], or by [CONTACT_590283]ïve subjects, will not be conducted for additional secondary 
analyses. 
Secondary Safety Endpoints: 
No statistical testing methods will be applied to statistically evaluate the differences 
on safety variables between treatment groups. Safety endpoint variables will be 
analyzed descriptively only. 
Analysis of secondary safety endpoint 1 (adverse events): 
Adverse events will be separated to pre-treatment AEs and TEAEs. TEAEs are 
defined as all AEs with onset or worsening (increase in severity) after receiving first 
dose of study medication (independent of whether it is BoNT/A-DP or placebo).  If it 
cannot be determined whether an AE is treatment-emergent due to a partial onset date, 
then it wil
l be counted as such. 
TEAEs will be analyzed overall (for BoNT/A-DP or placebo), and for BoNT/A-DP 
treatment group additionally separately per first treatment cycle or open label 
extension phase: events starting on or after first treatment up to before open label 
extension (first cycle), and events starting on or after re-treatment until end of study 
(open label phase). If it cannot be determined whether an AE started during the first 
treatment cycle or the open label extension phase due to a partial onset date, then it 
will be counted as having started during first treatment cycle. 
Events of subject s who started the first treatment with placebo but then entered the 
open label extension for re-treatment with BoNT/A-DP will be considered to placebo 
for the first cycle and to BoNT/A-DP for the open label phase.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) 
and preferred term (PT) (MedDRA). The number of events, as well as the number and 
rate of affected subject s will be reported. TEAEs (SOC and PT) will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_12917], severity, relationship to study medication, and 
relationship to procedure. Treatment-emergent AESIs will be tabulated separately.

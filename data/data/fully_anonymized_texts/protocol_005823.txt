1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_460492] -operative, single -dose 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab and cryoablation in patients with early  stage/resectable breast cancer. 
The central  idea for this project  is to make  a major  advance  for women  with early  stage  breast 
cancer by [CONTACT_460571]’s immune response to their recently diagnosed, 
resectable  breast  cancer  prior  to definitive  surgical  management,  thereby  [CONTACT_460572]-term 
immunity to the primary breast tumor, and ulti mately, cure.  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_460493]-operative,  single -dose ipi[INVESTIGATOR_103966]/or  cryoablation  in patients 
with early stage/resectable breast cancer was recently completed at MSKCC and met the 
primary endpoint of safety/tolerability.  In this study we are building on the success of this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_460494], to further evaluate the safety of a therapeutic strategy whereby [CONTACT_28045]’s 
immune system is stimulated to recognize and respond to the specific features of their own 
tumor. Our strategy combines two interventions: first  we induce activation and maturation of 
dendritic cells and tumor -specific T cells by [CONTACT_12783] -presentation of tumor antigens via local 
destruction of tumor tissue by [CONTACT_101352]. Second, we administer ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a CTLA4 
blocking  antibody, and nivolumab, an  antibody  against programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1), 
that together enhance the magnitude and potency of the tumor specific T cell response.  
One study arm of 6 patients will be enrolled. At the time of the initial surgical consultation, 
potentially eligibl e candidates will be identified by [CONTACT_460573] ([CONTACT_460611]) or a consenting medical 
oncologist and an appointment with consenting professionals from radiology, if feasible, to 
evalu ate eligibility  for cryoablation.  Prior  to protocol  intervention,  consent  will take place  at 
the first available  appointment  with a consenting  professional.  Consenting,  eligible  women 
will then be registered to receive single -dose ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460495]. 
All study  interventions (including  the cryoablation, drug administration, and imaging  dates) 
will be defined by [CONTACT_7416] -determined, non -study surgical date.  
The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of pre -operative ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], nivolumab 
and cryoablation in patients with biopsy  proven resectable breast cancer. If at least 5 of the 6 
patients  are without  an adverse  event  (AE)  necessitating  delay  in surgery,  the regimen  will be 
considered safe/tolerable for further study. Secondary aims of this study are to explore and 
characterize pre - and post -intervention peripheral and tumor responses to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
nivolumab and cryoablation.

Primary  Objective  
• To assess  the safety  and tolerability  of pre-operative  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  nivolumab  and intratumoral 
cryoablation in patients with resectable breast cancer.  
 
Exploratory  Objectives:  
To evaluate  the effect  of cryoablation  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab  administration  on intratumoral  and 
serum lymphocyte phenotypes, intratumoral and serum dendritic cells (DCs), serum cytokines, 
disease related biomarkers, antibody responses to selected antigens, and humoral and cellular 
responses to tumor antigens and recall non -tumor a ntigens.  
• To assess  the effect  of treatment  on ratios  of specific  intratumoral  and serum  T cell populations 
including CD4+FOXP3+ T -regulatory cells (Tregs) and CD8+Effector cells.  
• To explore  T cell diversity  and clonality  changes  by [CONTACT_223883]  
• To assess  the pharmacodynamic  effects  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  nivolumab  and cryoablation  on Absolute 
Lymphocyte Count (ALC) and absolute T cell count (see below).

and ultimately, cure.  
 
Breast cancer is a global public health burden with more than [ADDRESS_588465] cancer 
represents  both an advance  (better  targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460497])  and a challenge 
(ever smaller subsets make drug development difficult).  Therefore, a therapeutic stra tegy that  
simultaneously  utilizes  the individual  (and possibly  unique)  aspects  of each patient’s  tumor  combined 
with greater generalizability (to the entire patient population) could represent a significant advance.  
Our goal is, therefore, to combine the b iological promise of personalized therapy  (via stimulation of 
the effected  individual’s  immune  system)  with a standard  therapeutic  intervention  (cryoablation  with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab  administration)  thereby  [CONTACT_460576].

T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) resulting in immuno -stimulation. Treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460499], including 
prostate, bladder, and renal cell carcinoma. However, it has been most extensively studied in 
malignant melanoma with overall response rates of 10 -20% demonstrated in multiple studies and 
significant survival benefits when compared with a gp100 vaccine.11,12 The agent is generally well 
tolerated with few grade 3/[ADDRESS_588467] been observed in untreated metastatic melanoma with the combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460500].61 
 
The combination of tumor cryoablation and immunomodulation has been shown in animal models,  
by [CONTACT_460577], to generate such a systemic anti -tumor response.4 Specifically, local tumor 
destruction  with cryoablation  can lead to exposure  of DCs with suffic ient quantities  of tumor  antigens 
to ultimately lead to DC maturation and activation. Recently, our collaborators ([CONTACT_460612]’s 
group at MSKCC) showed that combination therapy with cryoablation and CTLA4 blockade 
successfully mediated rejection of m etastatic prostate cancer lesions and prevented the growth of 
secondary tumors in preclinical murine models.4 Furthermore, in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_460501] -dose pre - 
operative ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164]/or cryoablation in women with early stage breast cancer completed at 
MSKCC, the combination of CTLA4 blockade with cryoablation was safe and tolerable  
Cryoablation and single dose ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 10mg/kg were safe/well tolerated alone and in 
combination. The primary endpoint of this trial was reached, with all [ADDRESS_588468] - 
of-care surgical mastectomy  without delay. No treatment -associated grade III/IV adverse events, and 
one unrelated grade III/IV adverse event, were recorded on study. One subject from group C (cryo+ 
ipi) developed a grade 3maculopapular rash originating at the site of the mastectomy drain, which 
erupted hours after mastectomy and spread to involve the face, neck and chest. Based upon the 
timing, appearance, and distribution of the rash, the treating dermatologist concluded that the rash 
was re lated to peri -operative anti -septic wash and/or cephalexin administration, rather than the study 
intervention. Skin biopsy revealed mixed -pattern dermatitis with eosinophilic infiltrate, consistent 
with a hypersensitivity reaction. Combination therapy was also associated with sustained peripheral 
elevations  in Th1-type cytokines,  proliferating  CD4+  and CD8+  T cells,  and ICOS  expression  as well 
as post -treatment proliferation of T -effector cells relative to T -regulatory cells within the tumor.56

This project directly translates the pre -clinical data developed at our institution demonstrating that 
cryoablation combined with CTLA4 blockade synergize to mediate tu mor rejection into clinical 
practice, and the clinical data generated at our institution demonstrating the safety of single dose 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460504] -operative setting. We hypothesize that by [CONTACT_460578] i mmune system of the effected individual, that this strategy will confer

pre-operative cryoablation in combination with single dose ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460505]. Because of 
toxicity  observed with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460506], each 
drug will be administered at a conservatively low dose of 1 mg/kg in women with early stage breast

Principles  of the Proposed  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460508]:  
Thermal ablation treatments s uch as cryoablation emerged as an alternative to surgical resection and 
as treatment for many inoperable tumors including breast, prostate, kidney, liver, adrenal and lung.13 
Cryoablation, or tissue destruction by [CONTACT_338747], involves percutaneous placement of a needle -like 
probe(s) through the skin and into the tumor under image guidance whereby [CONTACT_460579]. The treatment success is dependent on achieving adequate freezing margin of the ice ball 
containing the tumor. The temperature necessa ry for reliable cryoablation induced cell death is - 
20oC.[ADDRESS_588471] using thermal mappi[INVESTIGATOR_460509]. Cryoablation zones were larger in kidney than lung and l iver and felt to represent variations  
in vascular perfusion relative to the tissue density of these different organs producing the  
phenomenon commonly referred to as the “thermal sink” effect, described by [CONTACT_460580].[ADDRESS_588472] damage to the cell membranes 
and cellular organelles through the formation of the ice crystals. Thereafter, thrombosis of small 
vessels is observed in the ablation bed within hours to days followin g the procedure. Cryoablation, 
unlike  other  ablative  tools such  as radiofrequency  ablation (RFA), allows  the operator  to visualize  the 
complete ice ball on intra -procedural images. This permits greater confidence that the tumor is 
confined within the treatment zone. Additionally, when comparing our institutional experience with 
cryotherapy  versus  RFA, it was noted that the procedural  pain was significantly  less with

 cryotherapy.19 This experience primarily reflects renal ablation models; however, it is reasonable to 
expect that these advantages also apply in the ablation of the breast.  
 
The ice ball from cryoablation is w ell visualized on MR images as an area of low signal. This can 
allow intra -procedural monitoring of the treatment to ensure adequate coverage of the tumor and 
ensure avoidance of injury to nearby  [CONTACT_460581].  Breast cancer lesions are also well  seen 
on MR images allowing an ideal target for cryoablation needle placement. The same devices that are 
used in the MR environment to allow breast biopsy and localization will be available to guide 
cryoablation probe placement.  
 
In addition to its effect on the localized tumor, it has been hypothesized that cryoablation can induce 
systemic anti tumor response that results in regression of distant metastatic lesions. Following 
ablation the necrotic tumor remains within the body, the vigorous inflammatory re sponse to the 
necrotic tissue with the sustained release of tumor antigens from the dying cells, which are captured 
by [CONTACT_460582] (APCs), subsequently this will lead to maturation activation and 
migration of the APCs to the draining lymph  nodes (LNs) where eventually the activation of tumor 
specific T cells occurs.16,[ADDRESS_588473]. James Allison’s laboratory has demonstrated that the combination of cryoablation and 
immune modulati on (such as with CTLA4 blockade) can lead to rejection of tumor in murine models 
of prostate cancer (see below section on the rationale for the combination).[ADDRESS_588474] cancer, indicate that these procedures 
are safe and well tolerated procedures.21 
Preclinical data from mouse models of mammary carcinoma showed that adoptive transfer of T cells 
from cryo -ablated tumor draining lymph nodes generated a si gnificant increase in the fraction of 
tumor specific T -cells and anti -tumor activity. This increased activity ultimately translated into 
significant reduction of pulmonary metastases when compared to adoptive transfer of T -cells from 
mouse lymph nodes afte r surgical tumor excision or no treatment. These data demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the “cryo -immunotherapy” approach in the adjuvant treatment in breast cancer17 
Utilizing more modern techniques, researchers in Japan demonstrated the ability to manage locally 
advanced breast cancer with cryosurgery. In [ADDRESS_588475] tumors such as fibroadenomas.23

Cryoablation successfully destroyed 100% of cancers <1.0 cm. For tumors between 1.0 and 1.5 cm, 
this success rate was achieved only in patients with invasive ducta l carcinoma without a significant 
ductal carcinoma -in-situ (DCIS) component. Morin et al explored the use of MRI -guided  
cryoablation in 25 patients.25 Complete pathologic ablation was achieved in only 13 of 25 patients; 
however, this study included much la rger tumors, ranging from 1.2cm to 6cm (mean = 2.8cm). The 
authors were able to accurately predict success using a combination of MR images and post - 
procedure  scinti -mammography  and no delays  in scheduled  mastectomies  where  reported.  Both  of the

Rationale  for Immune  Therapy  with  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460510] T cells requires not only stimulation of the antigen receptor by [CONTACT_79336] /major 
histocompatibility  complexes, but also by [CONTACT_3252] -stimulatory signals.27 These signals are provided by [CONTACT_460583]28, which is constitutively expressed on T -cell surfaces, with CD80 and CD86 
molecules, which are present on APC. CD28 -B7 co -stimul atory signals are critical for the induction 
of T -cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and effector functions which ultimately translate into 
clinical effects (Kearney 1995).  CTLA4 is an activation -induced T -cell surface molecule that binds 
CD80 and CD8 6 with greater avidity than CD28. CTLA4 ligation down -regulates T -cell responses, 
which results in an abrogation of the clinical effects provided by T -cell activation.29 Blockade of 
CTLA4/B7 interactions results in an increase in T -cell activation.  
Perhaps the most convincing demonstration of the down -regulatory role of CTLA4 came from 
examination of mice with a null mutation.[ADDRESS_588478] 
spontaneously activated T cells evident at approximately 1 week after birth, follo wed by [CONTACT_460584].31 These mice die at approximately 3 weeks of age, either 
as a result of polyclonal T cell expansion and tissue destruction or as a result of toxic shock resulting 
from lymphokine production by [CONTACT_941] T c ells. Since thymocyte differentiation and selection proceed 
normally in CTLA4 -deficient mice, the rampant T cell expansion that occurs in the mice indicates  
that CTLA4 plays a critical role in down -regulating T cell responses in the periphery.32 Many 
precl inical studies demonstrated that treatment with anti -murine CTLA4 monoclonal antibody 
resulted in tumor rejections, for example CTLA4 blockade led to rejection of immunogenic colon 
carcinoma and fibrosarcoma murine models.33 However, rejection of less immu nogenic tumors, such 
as murine melanoma B16, was achieved only  when CTLA4 blockade was combined with vaccines or 
radiation therapy.

 phase  3 study  showed  that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  either  alone  or with gp100  vaccine,  improved  overall  survival 
compared with gp100 alone in previously treated metastatic melanoma.11 Specifically, a 3.8 month 
increase in overall survival and a doubling of the 1 year survival rate was demonstrated in favor of 
the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated group.  
PD-1 (or CD279) is a member of the CD28 family of T -cell costimulato ry receptors that include 
immunoglobulin super family members CD28, CTLA -4, inducible co -stimulator (ICOS), and B and 
T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). PD -[ADDRESS_588479] been identified: PD -L1 (also known as B7 -H1 or CD274) and PD -L2 
(also known as B7 -DC or CD273). PD -L1 and PD -L2 have been shown to down -regulate T -cell 
activation upon bi nding to PD -1 in both murine and human systems.69 The interaction of PD -1 with 
its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, that are expressed on antigen -presenting cells (APC) and dendritic 
cells (DC), transmits negative regulatory stimuli to down -modulate the activated  T-cell immune 
response. The absence or inhibition of PD -[ADDRESS_588480] genetic factors, PD -1 deficiency  or inhibition 
is not accompanied by a universal loss of toler ance to self antigens.  
Tumors can express tumor -specific antigens as a result of mutational burden and ongoing immune 
surveillance is believed to control the development of many tumors. Tumor progression may depend 
upon  acquisition  of mechanisms  which  permit  them  to evade  an effective  immune  response.  One such 
mechanism of evasion may be the expression of ligands which engage inhibitory receptor(s) on anti - 
tumor T -cells of many tumors. PD -L1 expression has been found on a number of tumors including 
breast cancer, and may be a me chanism by [CONTACT_426409] -1 to evade an 
effective anti -tumor immune response.70 Expression of INF -γ by T -cells is known to induce PD -L1 
expression in tumors. PD -L1 expression has been associated with poor prognoses multiple cancers, 
and binding of PD -L1 to PD -1 on T -cells may limit effective immune responses. Co -localization of 
lymphoid cell infiltrates and PD -L1 staining has been observed in human melanoma.71 
Studies in multiple tumor models using a chimeric murine anti -mouse PD -1 anti body showed that 
PD-1 blockade has anti -tumor activity. Blocking PD -1 in PD -L1+ tumors may reverse the  
inactivation of tumor -specific effector T -cells at the tumor site as well activate anti -tumor responses 
that are limited by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 expression on “host” DC  or APC. The anti -tumor effects of anti -PD-[ADDRESS_588481] that both PD -L1+ and PD -L1- tumors may be targeted 
using this approach. In addition, in several tumor models in which anti -PD-1 has proved ineffective, 
PD-1 blockade can  be combined with vaccines, tumor -destructive modalities, or other 
immunomodulatory antibodies for improved therapeutic efficacy.72,73

Possible  toxicities  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460514]:  
- Infusion reactions: Fever, chills, sweating, shakes, itching, rash, hyper - or hypotension, 
difficulty breathing, flushing, nausea, vomiting. It is likely that most infusion -related adverse 
events will occur within the first 24 hours after beginning the infusion, and may be treated by 
[CONTACT_460585], or with supportive treatment as indicated in Section 
11.3.  
 
- Immune -related Adverse Events (irAE): Many of the adverse events considered related to 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460515] a consequence of the intrinsic biological 
activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In prior ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79257], an irAE was defined as any 
adverse event associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune -mediated event . 
Disease progression, infections and other etiologic causes were ruled out or deemed unlikely 
as contributing to the event. Supportive data, such as autoimmune serology tests or biopsies, 
were considered to be helpful but not necessary to categorize an ev ent as an irAE. Events of 
unclear etiology which were plausibly immune mediated were conservatively categorized as 
irAEs even if serologic or histopathology data were absent. These irAEs likely reflect a loss  
of tolerance to some self -antigens or an unchec ked immune response to gut or skin flora. 
Some breakthrough of immunity may be inseparably linked to the clinical antitumor activity 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Immune -related adverse events predominately involve the GI tract, endocrine 
glands, liver or skin. Experienc e with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460516] -limited, with few exceptions; irAEs were clinically manageable and reversible with 
supportive care or corticosteroids (see treatment algorithm Appendix 2 -6). Notably, IrAE

cases of diarrhea began as mild and became very severe (Beck 2006).  Serious GI irAEs 
mostly involved diarrhea or colitis (e.g. hemorrhagic colitis that was unresponsive to medical 
management  and necessitated  colectomy,  bowel wall  perforations  associated  with and without 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -induced colitis). Diarrhea/colitis is one of the most serious AEs and must be 
evaluated in a timely fashion (see diarrhea management algorithm in Appendix 4).  All 
patients with diarr hea will be seen by  [CONTACT_460586] a CT Scan/colonoscopy  if 
necessary.

- Gastrointestinal perforation in association with narcotic use: Isolated cases of intestinal 
perforation in association with narcotic use have been reported. The use of narcotics may 
potentially mask GI symptoms or delay detection of their relevant complications, such as 
bowel perforation.  
 
- Inflammatory Hepatotoxicity:  Immune -related hepatic dysfunction, including hepatitis or 
abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) attributed to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224], has been reported. 
Subjects may develop elevations in LFTs in the absence of clinical symptoms. Inflammatory 
hepatotoxicity i ncludes non -infectious hepatitis (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis). Hepatic irAEs  
generally occur in the first 12 weeks of treatment and are primarily reversible  (see 
hepatotoxicity management algorithm in Appendix 5).  
 
- Hypophysitis/Hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_460521]: 
Hypophysitis/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297],  clinically  manifested  by [CONTACT_29429],  has been  reported.  Most

 Possible  toxicities with  Nivolumab may  include:  
CA209003 is a Phase [ADDRESS_588487] 
previously  treated advanced solid tumors, including  melanoma, RCC, NSCLC, colorectal cancer, and 
hormone -refractory prostate cancer. Subjects received nivolumab at  doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 
mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, up to a maximum of 2 years of total therapy. As of 18 -Mar- 
2013, a total of 306 melanoma subjects were treated with nivolumab in the dose range of 0.1 - 10 
mg/kg.  
 
No maximal tolerated dose was identified in CA209003. The incidence, severity and relationship of 
AEs were generally similar across dose levels and tumor types. Nivolumab related AEs of any grade 
occurred in 75.2% of subjects. Of the 306 treated subjects, 303 (99.0%) subjects have at least [ADDRESS_588488] frequently reported AEs were fatigue (54.9%), 
decreased appetite (35.0%), diarrhea (34.3%), nausea (30.1%), and cough (29.4%).  
 
Treatment -related AEs were reported in 230 (7 5.2%) of the [ADDRESS_588489] frequently 
reported treatment -related AEs were fatigue (28.1%), rash (14.7%), diarrhea (13.4%), and pruritus 
(10.5%). Most treatment -related AEs were low grade. Treatment -related high grade (Grade 3 -4) AEs 
were reported in 52 (17.0%) of subjects. The most common treatment -related high grade AEs were 
fatigue (2.3%) and diarrhea (1%).  
Drug -related SAEs occurred in 11.5% of subjects. Grade [ADDRESS_588490] 2 
subjects included: diarrhea (3 subjects, 1.0%), pneumonitis (3 subjects, 1.0%), pneumonia (2  
subjects, 0.7%) and lipase increased (2 subjects, 0.7%). Select AE categories (events with a potential 
inflammatory mechanism requiring more frequent monitoring and/or unique intervention such as 
immunosu ppressants and/or endocrine replacement therapy) include: GI AEs, pulmonary AEs, renal 
AEs, hepatic AEs, skin AEs, and endocrinopathies. In addition, Select AEs include a category for 
infusion reactions.  
 
Each category is composed of a discrete set of pref erred terms, including those of greatest clinical 
relevance. These Select AEs are considered events of interest based on the mechanism of action and 
were previously referred to as immune -related AEs or immune -mediated AEs. The 10 mg/kg cohort 
had numerical ly greater frequency of high -grade select AEs including the subcategories of 
endocrinopathies, GI, pulmonary, and infusion reactions (Table 11.1.3 -1) Most high grade events 
resolved following the treatment guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary events, GI events, hepatic 
events, renal events, and endocrine events, respectively.  
 
Treatment -related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 32 (10.5%) of the [ADDRESS_588491] frequent  of these  were  pneumonitis  (8 subjects; 2.6 %) and colitis  (3 
subjects; 1.0%).There were 3 (1%) drug related deaths; each occurred after development of

24, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251369] 12 weeks for 8 doses. The three initial 
dose escalation cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 (nivolumab 0.3  mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 
14), Cohort 2 (nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 17) and Cohort 3 (nivolumab 3 
mg/kg plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg; n = 6). The study was subsequently amended to include Cohort 2a 
which evaluated nivolumab 3 mg/kg  plus ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg (n = 16). Safety data were pooled to 
summarize the overall findings.  
 
At least one AE, regardless of whether they were attributed to the therapy, has been reported in 81 
(94.2%) of the 86 subjects (Table 11.2.1 -1). A numerically hi gher number of subjects in the 
combination therapy treatment groups experienced severe AEs, regardless of causality and treatment 
related, than those in the monotherapy treatment group.  
 
In the combination  treatment  groups,  the following  DLTs  were  observed  during  the dose 
escalation in the combination cohorts:  
• Cohort  1: Grade  [ADDRESS_588494]/ALT  ([ADDRESS_588495]);  
• Cohort  2: Grade  3 uveitis  ([ADDRESS_588496])  and Grade  [ADDRESS_588497]/ALT ([ADDRESS_588498]);  
• Cohort  3: Grade  4 elevated lipase  (2 subjects)  and Grade  3 eleva ted lipase  ([ADDRESS_588499]).  
Based  on these  data,  Cohort 2  was identified  as the maximum  tolerated dose  (MTD) and 
Cohort [ADDRESS_588500] frequent treatment related AEs were rash (54.7%), pruritus

Immunotherapy  and Breast  Cancer:  
The interrelationship between the tumor, the tumor microenvironment and the function of infiltrating 
immune cells at the tumor site, is important for generating efficacious anti -tumor immune response 
(Naito 1998). It is also well established that the magni tude of the tumor burden leads to local 
suppression  and apoptosis  of the infiltrating  T-Cells.[ADDRESS_588502]  cancer,  the influence  of tumor  burden 
on the generation of tumor antigen -specific cytotoxic T -lymphocytes (CTLs) was investigated in a 
phase I/II cli nical trial in the metastatic setting. The study evaluated the cytotoxic function in an 
adoptive immunotherapy model in 2 patient study  arms, one with macroscopic disease and other with 
a complete remission (CR). The  results revealed that the cytotoxic fun ction was sustained in only  one 
CR patient, suggesting that tumor burden had an inverse effect on the function of the generated 
CTLs.[ADDRESS_588503] of T regs, a subse t of CD+ T cells. These cells have a potent ability to suppress immunity by

numbers  of T regs were  present  in patients  with higher  risk tumors including high -grade  tumors,  tumors

numbers  correlated  with relapse rates and even overall  survival.  [ADDRESS_588505] cancer and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460528] a promising opportunity for therapeutic

The presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has recently demonstrated prognostic  (and

Rationale  for Combined  Therapy  with  Cryoablation  and Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460529] a cytoreductive modality (i.e. intra -tumoral cryoablation) with 
immune -modulation are promising strategies for the management of tumors. For example,

successfully me diated rejection of metastatic prostate cancer lesions and prevented the growth of 
secondary tumors in mice (Figure 1).

As part of the completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_143393] -operative ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164]/or cryoablation, immunologic 
correlatives were conducted on both PBMCs and TILs. Tumors treated with combined ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460530] a higher ratio of C D8+Ki67+ proliferating T eff cells to 
CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg cells suggesting that combined therapy may favorably shift the 
effector/regulatory  T-cell ratio.  [ADDRESS_588506] was not seen with Ki67 -negative T eff cells. One possible 
explanation is that cryoablat ion depletes both T eff and T reg cells, and that concurrent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460531] T eff cells.  We also demonstrated that cryoablation 
and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460532] (as measured by [CONTACT_20129]γ and ICOShi T-cells by

 At the time of the initial MSKCC surgical consultation, potentially eligible candidates will be 
identified, informed consent forms provided, and surgery -related dates requested/set per standard -of- 
care. As soon as possible, potentially eligible patients will be evaluated by 1) the principal 
investigator ([CONTACT_460611]), a designated consenting medical oncologist for a medical 
oncology assessment or the referring surgeon and 2) consenting professionals from radiology for 
assessment  of amenability  to cryoablation,  if feasible.  All available  (per the standard  of care)  imaging 
(MMG +/ - breast US +/ - breast MRI) will be reviewed to determine eligibility for cryoablation and 
thus, study particip ation. Whenever feasible, the radiology evaluation will be arranged prior to the 
presurgical testing date so that baseline research bloods may be collected after the patient is 
confirmed eligible and together with  the non -study presurgical bloods. Prior to  protocol intervention, 
consent will take place at the first available appointment with a consenting professional.  
 
Consenting, eligible women, with tumors amenable to MRI or US -guided cryoablation will be 
enrolled. All study interventions (including the cryoablation, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab administration, 
and imaging dates) will be defined by [CONTACT_7416] -determined, non -study surgical date. Research study

Most patients will have an outside biopsy  confirming the diagnosis of breast cancer at the time of the 
initial surgical consultation. However, because the cryoablation proce dure will cause near complete 
tumor destruction (that in turn will cause immunologic effect and antitumor response), pre - 
cryoablation  breast  biopsies  will be performed. At  least three  18G MRI  or US-guided  core biopsies  of 
the primary  breast tumor will be obtained (together with core biopsies of any  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_460536]) if feasible. Two core breast specimens will be provided to 
the MSKCC Breast and Imaging Center (BAIC) pathology department for routine (standar d of care) 
testing. Additional core biopsy specimens will be sent to the immune monitoring facility (IMF) for 
research purposes as detailed in section 12. If not all three core biopsies can be performed, this will 
not make the patient ineligible.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNO STIC  AGENTS  
5.1 Cryoablation  
Cryoablation has been successfully  adopted for  the treatment of  solid tumors for  many years. Initially 
it was an intraoperative procedure, but with advanced engineering devices for percutaneous 
cryoablation has been made possible. In addition the use of imaging to guide the ablation provides 
increased confidence of appropriate targetin g of the tumor. The cryoablation will be performed 
percutaneously under MRI or US image guidance. Once the probes are properly placed in the tumor 
freeze -thaw cycles will be performed. The probes will then be removed. The patients will be  
observed for a sh ort time prior to expected same day discharge.  
 
 
5.2 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460539]:  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (BMS -734016), a fully human monoclonal antibody that recognizes CTLA4, is 
considered an immunotherapeutic drug and is currently in development as an anti -cancer agent. Th e 
proposed mechanism of  action for  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460540]4  with CD80 
(B7-1) and CD86 (B7 -2) molecules expressed on antigen -presenting cells (APC), with subsequent 
blockade of the inhibitory modulation of T -cell activation pro moted by [CONTACT_102429]4:CD80/CD86 
interaction.  
 
Nivolumab (BMS -936558), a fully human monoclonal antibody that recognizes PD1, is considered  
an immunotherapeutic drug and is currently in development as an anti -cancer agent. The proposed 
mechanism of action for nivolumab is interference with the interaction between PD1 and PDL1. T  
cell influx into tumors results in the release of IFN -γ, which up -regulates PD -L1 expression by  [CONTACT_453638]. PD -L1 binds to PD -1, which is expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T cells, generating a n egative signal that 
causes T cell exhaustion (inhibiting the ability of T cells to recognize and kill their targets). During 
antigen presentation by [CONTACT_405], PD1 can also act as a checkpoint inhibitor where a negative 
signal can be sent by [CONTACT_460591] -L1 or the closely related (and dendritic cell –specific) 
negative regulatory ligand PD -L2.68 
 
Concomitant  Medications  
Participants will be advised not to take steroids, immunosuppressants, or anti -inflammatory 
medications such as NSAIDS fro m the day of trial entry and until 30 days after surgery unless 
recommended by [CONTACT_34355] (or co -investigators) for the treatment of immune 
related adverse events (irAEs) or adrenal insufficiency.

Research tests: Blood (4 CPT tubes) for immune response studies will be sent to the IMF  (currently 
located on the 15th floor of the Zuckerman building) for exploratory studies. These baseline blood 
samples  may be drawn  on the day of the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/Nivoluma b injection  (if applicable),  but should 
be drawn prior to the injection.  
All other  screening  assessments  should  be performed  within  14 days prior  to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab 
administration:  
• Medical  history,  demographic  data,  adverse  events,  physical  examination,  ECOG  PS, 12-Lead

No delay  in surgery  will be made to  accommodate  participation in the  protocol.  
9.0 TREATMENT/ INTERVENTION  PLAN  
Patients will undergo breast biopsy with cryoablation 7 -10 days prior to the planned surgery, and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460543] 1 -5 days before cryoablation. All patients will undergo 
surgery  at the pre-determined  day defined at  the initial  surgical  consultation  as detailed  in section  4.1. 
9.1 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460539]:  
Women  will receive  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_411302]  1-5 days prior  to US  or MRI -guided  core biopsy  and 
cryoablation date. Intravenous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195679] a single 1 mg/kg dose to be 
infused intravenously over 90 minutes in the chemotherapy suite of the BAIC. Intravenous 
nivolumab  will be administered  as a single 3  mg/kg  dose to be infused  intravenously  over [ADDRESS_588526]. Wolchok  of various  doses  of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460544], there was a 98% AE rate, a 93% treatment related AE rate, a 72% grade 3/4 
AE rate, a 53% treatment related grade 3/4 AE rate and a 49% serious AE rate.61 Toxicity  with both 
drugs administered at 3mg/kg was considered unacceptable, a nd nivolumab at 1mg/kg with  
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460545] 3mg/kg  was considered  the maximum  dose with an “acceptable”  level  of AEs - a 
threshold  which  is unlikely  to be “acceptable”  in the curative  setting.  Thus,  combination  therapy  with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79214] 1mg/kg and nivolumab administered at 3mg/kg was recommended and 
will be the dose we will administer for this study.  
9.1.1 Dose  Calculations  
Calculate  Total Dose  as follows  for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645]:  
Patient  body  weight  in kg x [1 mg/kg]  = total dose in mg 
Calculate Total Infusion Volume as follows:  
Total dose in mg  ÷ 5 mg/mL  = infusion volume in  mL 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Protocol #: 16 -495 A(5)  
Approved:  3-MAY -2017  
Page  27 of 55  
 Calculate  Rate of Infusion  as follows:  
Infusion volume  in mL  ÷ 90 minutes =  rate of  infusion in mL/min.  
For example,  a patient weighing  114 kg (250 lb) would  be administered 114  mg of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (114 
kg x 1 mg/kg = 114 mg) with an infusion volume of 22.8 mL (114 mg ÷ 5 mg/mL = 22.8 mL) at a 
rate of approximately .25mL/min (22.8 mL ÷ 90 minutes) in 90 minutes.  
9.1.2 Storage,  Preparation,  and Administration 
Identification  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460546] 5 mg/m L single -use vials  (10 mL  or 40 mL).  The sterile  solution  in the 
vial is clear  and colorless  to pale yellow.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460547].  
 
Nivolumab is available in 10 mg/mL  single -use vials (10  mL). The sterile solution in the vial is clear 
and colorless to pale yellow. Nivolumab is administered via intravenous infusion only.  
 
Packaging  and Labeling  
BMS will provide ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460548]. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460549] -label  containers.  The labels  will contain  the protocol  prefix,  batch  number, 
content, storage conditions, and dispensing instructions along with the Investigational New Drug 
(IND) caution statement. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_460550] a con centration of 5 mg/mL in vials 
containing  10 ml or 40  mL solution. Nivolumab will be supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL  in

(obtained on the same day of, and prior to, the infusion).  
Nivolumab is to be administered as an IV infusion with a 0.2μm or 1.2 μm in -line filter using a 
volumetric pump, at the 3 mg/kg dose, to complete the infusion in [ADDRESS_588530] weight 
(obtained on the same day of, and prior to, the infusion).  
Separate  infusion  bags and filters  must  be used for each infusion.  Nivolumab  is to be administered 
first. The nivolumab infusion must be pr omptly followed by a saline flush to clear the line of 
nivolumab before starting the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182].  
9.2 Pre-cryoablation  core biopsies:  
At least three 18G MRI or US -guided core breast biopsies will be obtained at the core biopsy 
appointment for all participants, if feasible. If not all three core biopsies can be performed, this will 
not make the patient ineligible. Core biopsies of clinica lly or radiographically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_460556].  Two core breast  specimens  will be provided  to the MSKCC 
BAIC pathology  department for  routine  (standard of  care) testing. Additional core  biopsy  specimens 
will be sent to th e IMF for research purposes as detailed in section 12. The MRI or US -guided 
biopsies  will be performed  by [CONTACT_460595].  
9.3 Cryoablation:  
Percutaneous, MRI or US -guided cryoablation will be performed with a multiple freeze -thaw cycle. 
Freeze -thaw cycle strategies will be individualized to the patient a nd their tumor. Generally two 
cycles  will be performed  with each cycle  being  approximately  10 minutes  of freeze  time.  Intermittent 
imaging will guide the procedure to ensure the ice ball does not encroach on critical structures, 
including skin. The number of probes used will depend on the lesion size and location.  
Prior to the procedure the operator will rate the level of technical difficulty. Immediately after the 
procedure  the operator  will rate the expectation  of completeness  of therapy.  This information  will be

9.4 Blood  samples:  
All participants  will undergo  4 research  blood  draws  as indicated  in the protocol  schema  in Section  1 
(at ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab administration, cryoablation/biopsy, surgery, and 30 (+/ -10) days after 
surgery). Detailed collection/processing instructions are included in Section 12.  
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/I NTERVENTION  
The focus  of the evaluation  during  the treatment  will be directed  to assess  the safety  of the procedures 
described above.  
 
All patients will be observed for 30 minutes after drug injection to monitor for acute allergic 
reactions.  All participants  will be observed  in the PACU  after cryoablation  and/or  image  guided  core 
biopsies for a couple of hours prior to expected same day d ischarge if sedation or anesthesia is 
required.  
No additional  testing,  treatment,  or intervention  will be performed  on patient  accrued  to the protocol.  
Efforts  should  be made  to synchronize  post procedure  pain management,  and to try to avoid  NSAIDs 
(specifically COX -2 inhibitors) given their potential for immune modulation.  
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
In routine care for breast cancer, multiple cores are taken to insure adequate material for diagnosis. 
The potential complication associated with t hese procedures, such as bleeding and infection are the 
same  as those  associated  with these  procedures  when  done  as part of routine  care. Refer  to Appendix 
[ADDRESS_588532], skin injury, and pain at the ablation site. Other potential complications 
include paresthesias.  
11.2 Infusion Reactions  
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164]/or nivolumab may induce inf usion or hypersensitivity reactions. If such a 
reaction were to occur, it may manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, 
arthralgias, hypo or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. Infusion reactions 
should be graded according t o Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE,

 modified based on clinical judgment, local treatment standards and guidelines, and/or specific 
symptoms,  as appropriate:  
 
For Grade 1 symptoms: Mild reaction [e.g., localized cutaneous reactions including mild 
pruritus, flushing, rash] requires infusion rate to be decreased; intervention may be indicated.  
 
• Decrease  the rate of the  study  drug infusion until recovery  from  symptoms.  
• Remain at bedside  and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Diphenhydramine 50 mg may be administered at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
• When  symptoms  resolve,  restart the  infusion  at the original  infusion  rate. 
For Grade 2 symptoms: Moderate reaction [i. e., any symptom not listed above (mild 
symptoms) or below (severe symptoms) such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, 
hypotension with systolic blood pressure > 80 mm Hg], requires infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic tre atment [e.g., antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti 
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, i.v. fluids]; prophylactic pre -infusion 
medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours.  
 
• Discontinue  the study  drug infusion.  
• Begin  an i.v. infusion  of normal  saline,  and treat the subject  with diphenhydramine 
50 g i.v. (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen).  
• Remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid  
therapy may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
• When symptoms resolve, restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate; if no 
further  complications ensue  after 30 minutes,  the rate may be increased to 100%  of the 
original infusion rate.  
• Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, immediately d iscontinue the infusion; no 
further study drug will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_588533] until resolution of symptoms.

i.v. (or equivalent), as needed.  
• Remain  at bedside  and monitor  subject until  recovery  from symptoms.  
• Subject  should  be monitored  until the treating  physician  is comfortable  that the 
symptoms will not recur.  
• Treating  physician  should  follow  their institutional  guidelines  for the treatment  of 
anaphylaxis  
In the case of late-occurring  hypersensitivity  symptoms  (e.g.,  appearance  of a localized  or 
generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment m ay be given 
(e.g., oral antihistamine or corticosteroids).  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
12.1 Safety:  
Safety/tolerability  is the  primary  end point for  this project.  
 
Safety will be evaluated for all treated subjects using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE). Safety assessments will be based on 
medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign m easurements, physical 
examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. The incidence of observed adverse events will be 
tabulated  and reviewed  for potential  significance  and clinical  importance.  The reporting  period  for 
safety data will be from the date of fir st on -study dose to 12 weeks after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab 
administration.  
 
If there  are no clinical  signs  or symptoms  of toxicity , safety  bloods  will be done  every  2-3 weeks  and 
will include the following:  
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (COMP): aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase  (ALT),  albumin,  alkaline  phosphatase  (ALP),  total bilirubin,  calcium, 
creatinine, glucose, total protein, BUN, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate  
- Complet e blood  cell count  with differential and  platelet  count (CBC)  
- Thyroid  stimulating  hormone (TSH)  
 
If 5 of the 6 study  patients  are without  an AE necessitating  delay  in surgery,  the regimen  will be 
considered safe/tolerable for further study.  
 
12.2 Efficacy:  
Although not a primary endpoint, exploratory correlative studies will be performed to evaluate anti - 
tumor and immunological response pre - and post -treatment in individuals. Comparisons with other 
study participants will also be conducted. Breast cancer tissue specimens, axillary lymph nodes 
specimens where available and peripheral blood samples will be studied. The planned exploratory 
correlative studies currently include:

 Immune  response: 
The phenotypic and functional impact of the treatment will be explored by [CONTACT_460596]; peripheral blood (post treatment only).  These tests will be done at the IMF 
(currently located in the Zuckerman building).  
The explorator y objectives  of this study  are: 
1. To evaluate the effect of cryoablation and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab administration on: lymphocyte 
phenotype and serum cytokines, disease related biomarkers, antibody responses to selected 
antigens, and humoral and cellular respo nses to tumor antigens and recall non -tumor antigens.

including (but not limited to) the abundance and characteristics of inflammatory infiltrates (e.g., 
CD8 and CD4 cells and expression of some molecules on lymphocytes and tumors, respectively), 
and, 
3. To evaluate  serological  and cellular  immune correlates  of toxicity  and/or  clinical activity  
 
To this end, the specimens  to be  collected  for IMF  evaluation include:  
• At least 1 core  biopsy  sample (collected on the  core biopsy  date)  
• Surgery  specimen  
• Four  research  blood  samples:  
1. Baseline  blood  on the day of pre-surgical  testing  or on the day of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]/nivolumab 
injection prior to drug administration  
2. Blood on day  of core biopsy/cryoablation  
3. Blood on the  day prior  to or day of surgery  
4. Blood  30 (+/-10) days after  surgery . 
For the each  blood draw,  4 CPT  tubes  will be collected.  
• Flow  cytometric  analysis : 
1) T-cells:  activation  and memory  markers  
2) Dendritic  cells:  activation  and maturation  markers  and markers  of 
inhibitory/tolerogenic DCs  
• ELISA:  to identify  relevant  peripheral  blood cytokines  
• CBC:  to quantify  Absolute  lymphocyte  count (ALC).  
Pathology : Pre (core biopsies) and post (surgical tissue) treatment evaluation of the tumor will be 
performed for each study participant. The planned exploratory studies to evaluate treatment response 
include:  
 
• Evaluation  of T cell proliferation  as measured by  [CONTACT_15915]-67. 
• Expression  of the B7 -H1 inhibitory  molecule  (Ghebeh 2007)  
• Lymphocyte  infiltration  including  perivascular  infiltration.  
• Specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to further define particular 
lymphocytic population s such as T -regulatory cells (Tregs) (CD4+CD25+FOXP3+), 
effector T cells (Teff) (CD4+/CD8+) and the ratio between Tregs and Teff.

13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
Subjects  participating  may withdraw from the study  at any time and for  any reason.  
Subjects may  be removed from  the study  at any time due to severe  unacceptable  side effects,  life- 
threatening  events,  (as described  in Section  11), patient’s  non-compliance  with the defined  treatment 
plan,  the patient becomes  pregnant or  the patient’s  request  to withdraw  consent.  
For all participants,  failure  to have  the planned  surgery  at MSKCC  will result  in removal  from  the 
study.  
Patients  will be replaced  if they withdraw  from  the study  after signing  consent  but prior  to 
completing all study assessments.

imperative that any experimental pre -operative therapeutic innovation not undermine the timing of 
curative -intent surgery. Consequently, the primary endpoint for this study is safety/tolerability, as 
defined  by [CONTACT_460598]  3 or 4 adverse  events  that necessitates  a 
delay in surgery. Therefore, if 5 or 6 of the 6 patients are without an AE necessitating delay in 
surgery,  the regimen  will be considered  safe/tolerable  for further  study. The  probability  of observing 
5 or 6 patients (out of 6) who for whom therapy  is safe/tolerable is 0.53 if the true  safety/tolerability 
rate is 0.75, 0.65 if the true safety/tolerability rate is 0.8 0, and 0.89 if the true safety/tolerability  rate 
is 0.90. This rule is based on the time period from start of the investigation regimen to the date of 
surgery, which is estimated to be approximately 15 days.  Safety data up to 12 weeks following 
surgery wil l also be evaluated and reported.  
Study  design  and analysis  of the data will be performed  with the assistance  of Sujata  Patil,  PhD,

formal  statistical  analysis  or sample  size calculation  for this study.  All analysis  will be descriptive  in 
nature and the sample size is dictated by [CONTACT_460599].  
We have several exploratory secondary analyses.  As noted above, all analyses will be evaluated 
descriptively  and graphically.  Serum  and tumor  biomarker levels  (including  lymphocytes  and DC’s) 
and serum  cytokines  will be  plotted  over the study  timepoints. The  ratio of specific  intra-tumoral  and 
serum t cell populations (i.e. CD4+FOXP3+ T -regulatory cells (Tregs) to CD8+Effector cells) will 
also be plotted over study  timepoints. Other endpoints that will be summarized descriptively  include 
ALC, and absolute T cell count.

16.2 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan Ketter ing Cancer Center were 
approved by  [CONTACT_30589]  2001.  The plans address the new policies set 
forth  by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer Institute  for Data  and Safety 
Monitoring of Clinical Trials”  which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The MSKCC Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148],  safety  and 
quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assuran ce (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring, 
compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on clinical research 
QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus there are two institutional committees that 
are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.  The committees:  Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and 
Institutional Review Board.  
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its level of 
risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g. NIH sponsored, in -house 
sponsored, industrial sponsored , NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed and the monitoring 
procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
 
17.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS

17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154073]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an

17.2.1  Additional  Information  on Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
Collection  of Safety  Information  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any  new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre - 
existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigational  (medicinal)  product  and that does not necessarily  have  a causal  relationship  with this 
treatmen t. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigation al product.  
Although  overdose  and cancer  are not always  serious  by [CONTACT_52252],  these  events  should  be 
reported on an SAE form and sent to BMS in an expedited manner. An overdose is defined as the 
accidental or intentional ingestion or infusion o f any dose of a product that is considered both 
excessive and medically important.  
Note that all pregnancies, regardless of outcome, must be reported to the sponsor on a Pregnancy 
Surveillance  Form, not an SAE form. All pregnancies must be reported and fol lowed to outcome, 
including  pregnancies  that occur  in the female  partner  of a male  study  subject.  See Section  8.4 for 
instructions on reporting pregnancies.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Protocol #: 16 -495 A(5)  
Approved:  3-MAY -[ADDRESS_588538]  
All adverse  events,  including  those  that are serious,  will be graded  according  to the National  Cancer 
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0.  
The following  categories  and definitions  of causal  relationship  to investigational  product  as 
determined by a physician should be used for adverse events:  
• Definite:  The AE is clearly  related to the intervention.  
• Probable:  The AE is likely  related to the  intervention.  
• Possible:  The AE may  be related to the  intervention.  
• Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully  related to  the intervention.  
• Unrelated:  The AE is  clearly  NOT  related to  the intervention.  
Collection  and Reporting  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination,  or evaluation  of a subject.  (In order  to prevent  reporting  bias, subjects  should  not be 
questioned re garding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its 
individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, 
intensity , seriousness,  relationship  to investigational  product,  action  taken,  and treatment  required.  If 
treatment for the AE was administered, it should be recorded in the medical record.  
The investigator  shall  supply  the sponsor  and Ethics  Committee  with any additional  requested 
information, notably for reported deaths of subjects.  
Collection  and Reporti ng for Serious  Adverse  Events  
The investigator  should  notify  BMS  of any SAE  occurring  after the previously  specified  time period 
that is believed to be certainly, probably, or possibly related to the investigational product or 
protocol -specified procedure.  
All SAEs whether related or unrelated to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], must be immediately reported to BMS 
Worldwide  Safety  (by [CONTACT_26546])  within  [ADDRESS_588539] be kept on file at the study site.  
All SAEs  should be  faxed or  emailed to  BMS at:

For studies  conducted  under  an Investigator  IND, any event  that is both serious  and unexpected  must 
be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 7 days (death or life - 
threatening  event)  or 15 days (all other  SAEs)  after the investigator’s  or institution’s  initial  receipt  of 
the information. BMS will be provided with a sim ultaneous copy  of all adverse events filed with the 
FDA. SAEs should be reported on the MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be accessed at:

Serious  adverse  events,  whether  related  or unrelated  to investigational  product,  must  be recorded  on 
the SAE page and reported expeditiously to BMS (or designee) to comply with regulatory 
requirements. An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its 
status of seriousness . 
All SAEs  must  be immediately  reported  by [CONTACT_460601]  (fax)  and mailing  of the 
completed SAE page. In some instances where a facsimile machine is not available, overnight 
express mail may be used. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up report s are 
required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially 
reported.) In selected circumstances, the protocol may specify conditions that require additional 
telephone reporting.  
If the investigator  believes  that an SAE  is not related  to the investigational  product,  but is potentially 
related  to the conditions of  the study  (such  as withdrawal  of previous  therapy,  or a complication  of a 
study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE page.  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Protocol #: 16 -495 A(5)  
Approved:  3-MAY -[ADDRESS_588541], a follow -up 
SAE  report  should  be sent immediately  to the sponsor.  As follow -up information  becomes  available  it 
should be sent immediately  using  the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All 
SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
Handling  of Expedited  Safety  Reports  
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify  investigators of all SAEs that are suspected 
(certainly, probably, or possibly related to the investigational product) and unexpected (i.e., not 
previously  described  in the Investigator  Brochure).  In the European  Union  (EU),  an event  meeting 
these  criteria  is termed  a Suspected,  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse  Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R).  investigator 
notification of these events will be in the form of an expedited safety report (ESR).  
Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_460602]: increased 
frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE conside red associated with study 
procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard 
to study  subjects,  clinically  significant  safety  finding  from  a nonclinical  (eg, animal)  study,  important 
safety recommendations  from a study data monitoring committee, or sponsor decision to end or 
temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons.  
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with the 
Investigator  Brochure.  Where  required  by [CONTACT_460603] a central  IRB/IEC  for the 
study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC 
will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with 
the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
In addition,  suspected  serious  adverse  reactions  (whether  expected  or unexpected)  shall  be reported 
by [CONTACT_460604] t o local 
regulations (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
Nonserious  Adverse  Events  
The collection  of nonserious  AE information  should  begin  at initiation  of investigational  product. 
Nonserious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in period or 
other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
If an ongoing nonserious AE worsens in its intensity, or if its r elationship to the investigational 
product changes, a new nonserious AE entry for the event should be completed. Nonserious AEs 
should  be followed  to resolution  or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they become  serious.  Follow - 
up is also required for n onserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of investigational 
product, or those that are present at the end of study participation. Subjects with nonserious AEs at 
study completion should receive post -treatment follow -up as appropriate.  
All identified  nonserious  AEs must  be recorded  and described  in the medical record.

Appendix 2:   General Recommendation for Management of 
Suspected  Immune  Related  Adverse  Events  (irAE)  
A general  principle  is that differential  diagnoses  should  be diligently  evaluated  according  to standard  medical 
practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be consider ed and appropriately treated.  
 
Corticosteroids  are a primary  therapy  for immuno -oncology  drug-related  adverse  events.  The oral equivalent 
of the recommended  IV doses  may be considered  for ambulatory  patients  with low-grade  toxicity.  The lower 
bioavailability of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account when switching to the equivalent dose of 
oral corticosteroids.  
 
Consultation  with a medical  or surgical  specialist,  especially  prior  to an invasive  diagnostic  or therapeutic 
procedu re, is recommended.

GI ADVERSE  EVENT  MANAGEMENT  ALGORITHM  
Rule  out non-inflammatory  causes.  If non -inflammatory  cause  is identified,  treat accordingly  and continue 
therapy. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]/narcotics may mask symptoms of perforation. Infliximab should not be used in cases of 
perforation or sepsis.  
 
 
 
 
 
Patients  on IV steroids  may be switched  to an equivalent  dose of oral corticosteroids  (e.g. prednisone)  at start 
of tapering or earlier, once sustained clinical improvement is observed. Lower bioavailability of oral 
corticosteroids should be taken into account when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.

Study Description  The purpose of this study is to identify a tolerable dose for 
postpartum ketamine infusion using a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) 3+[ADDRESS_766866] that ketamine side 
effects occ ur with the loading dose.  
Study Population : Patients having  cesarean delivery (CD) who  are either: 1) 
planning not to breastfeed; or 2) are receiving ketamine as part of 
clinical care,  will be enrolled.  Ketamine will be started in  
postpartum patients, after cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Planned Sample Size:  The projected sample size will be a maximum of 12 patients with 
complete primary outcome data within the MTD 3+3 design.

3 v.7.0   05/29/2024  2 Background and Rationale  
 
2.1 Background  
 
A lack of data on new pain treatments in pregnancy  and lactation puts  1.2 million  US women  having 
cesarean delivery  (CD) every year  at risk for poor pain control, depressed mood, and poor recovery7,8. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_583350]6,9, current CD  treatments ignore  the 
multidimensionality of  pain, including  the influence  of mood  on pain. NMDA receptor antagonists like 
ketamine significantly reduce postoperative pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_583351] 40%10.  In addition to its 
analgesic effects, a single dose of IV ketamine has been shown to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_583352] 50% and remission rates 43- 77%
[ADDRESS_766867]-surgical acute pain management, with long-
lasting analgesia. Many trials (non-obstetric) have shown ketamine effectiveness for post-operative analgesia
94-96. Available postpartum ketamine studies have focused on various doses  (ranging  0.1-0.5 
mg/kg,  single  doses, infusions)  for efficacy16-18,[ADDRESS_766868] not emphasized side effects. Although high 
doses of ketamine induce psychomimetic  effects,  low doses,  such  as in the current proposal,  can reduce  
pain  without side effects10,78 and potentially reduce pain intensity for 1 year after a single dose (effect 
size 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 – 0.80)97.  
 In addition to its analgesic effects, ketamine use for depression treatment promotes fast, effective depression symptom reductions, a robust effect occurs from 4-[ADDRESS_766869]- infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 
40 min) in patients with MDD; this dose is commonly used for depression
87. The antidepressant effect 
lasts beyond psychotomimetic symptoms, which peak during the infusion and return to baseline within [ADDRESS_766870] traditional antidepressants whereby [INVESTIGATOR_13701] 1/3 of patients 
become symptom -free after 7 weeks of treatment with SSRI.85 A widely cited trial of 205 ketamine 
doses (0.5mg/kg, 40 min) for depression concluded ketamine was, “safe and well - tolerated” but did 
not probe patient acceptability of side effects33. Dose- dependent side effects are common, with a high 
incidence of vertigo, nausea, sedation, and dissociation in intranasal dosing to plasma levels similar to an IV dose of 0.5 mg/kg over 40min
88. These dose -dependent side effects preclude widespread use in 
the peripartum population. Identifying ketamine dose tolerability in a post -CD population has the 
potential to improve treatment of postoperative pain as well as mood- related outcomes of chronic pain 
such as comorbid onset of [COMPANY_003]. This work will  
 
Defining postpartum ketamine PK is critical to understanding the potential role of ketamine for [COMPANY_003] 
prevention, and to understanding the plasma ketamine concentration time profile with its maximum tolerated dose. There are no PK/PD models for ketamine -indu ced side effects or  analgesia, although  
there  are isolated reports  of ketamine  side effects  with  plasma  concentrations. Available trials that 
conclude ketamine is “well tolerated” did not query patient perspectives in acceptability
33. The 
duration of ketamine exposure may be important as well, given that subcutaneous administration may 
have greater antidepressant duration than intravenous administration of the same dose, despi[INVESTIGATOR_583353] 
4 v.7.0   05/29/2024  peak plasma concentrations in subcutaneous administration19. These knowledge gaps are significant 
because they limit patient -centered acceptability of ketamine and a finer understanding of its potential 
effective utility for [COMPANY_003] prevention. Because ketamine is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A and CYP2B6 
(increased activity in pregnancy and immediately after delivery)34, and because pregnancy induces 
sensitivity to anesthetics, it is critical in this project to identify a tolerable dose of postpartum ketamine and the pe rioperative factors impacting its PK. 
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
Defining postpartum ketamine  tolerable doses and ketamine PK is critical to understanding the 
potential role of ketamine for [COMPANY_003] prevention, and to understanding the plasma ketamine 
concentration time profile with its maximum tolerated dose. There are no PK/PD models for ketamine -

19. These knowledge gaps are significant because they limit patient-
centered acceptability of ketamine and a finer understan ding of its potential effective utility for [COMPANY_003] 
prevention. Because ketamine is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A and CYP2B6 (increased activity in pregnancy and immediately after delivery)
34, and because pregnancy induces sensitivity to anesthetics, it is 
critical in this project to identify a tolerable dose of postpartum ketamine and the perioperative factors impacting its PK.  
3 Hypotheses, Objectives and Endpoints  
 
3.1 Hypotheses  
3.2 Primary Hypothesis  
The purpose of this study is to identify a tolerable dose for postpartum ketamine infusion using a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 3+[ADDRESS_766871] that ketamine side effects occur with the loading dose. 
 
Our working hypothesis, based on our preliminary PK and safety data and that of Loo et al [19], is 
that a 12-hr IV ketamine infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/hour is the MTD. 
 
3.3
 Objectives  
3.3.1 Primary Objective: 
Quantify maximum  tolerable dose of postpartum ketamine infusion post-cesarean delivery. 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_766872] acceptability of low- dose ketamine infusion in peripartum people . 
5 v.7.0   05/29/2024   
3.3.3 Exploratory Objectives  
Measure maternal pain  and depression in this cohort before and  after cesarean delivery until  
12weeks postpartum. 
 
3.4 Endpoints  
 
3.4.1 Primary Endpoint  
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).   The MTD will be defined as the dose at which fewer than 
33% of patients experience  a DLT defined by [CONTACT_583410].  
 
Tolerability (dichotomous Yes/No)  
Tolerability  (YES) will be defined  as: lack  of adverse events (adverse event defined 
as: severe unresolved hemodynamic effect: systolic blood pressure <80 or >160, heart 
rate <40 or >120).33 
Lack of Tolerability will be defined as presence of any adverse event (i.e., severe unresolved hemodynamic effect: systolic blood pressure <80 or >160, heart rate <40 or >120).
[ADDRESS_766873] 
acceptability ratings by [CONTACT_4676], OR the experience of an  intolerable event as defined above. The 
escalation of dosing will be as noted in Figure 2 and is based on a modified Fibonacci sequence
101,102  with smaller proportional increases in dose in the escalation scheme. Escalations 
occur until 2 in a cohort of 3 to 6 experiences DLT (i.e., until ≥33% of patients experience DLT at 
that dose). The dose below  this level estimates the MTD. 
 
Participants will be classified as having had a DLT if any of the following conditions are met:  
• Persisting (i.e., unresolved after 3 consecutive measurements within a 15-minute interval) hemodynamic side effects defined as below  and despi[INVESTIGATOR_583355].   
o Systolic blood pressure <80 or >1 60  
o Heart rate <40 or >120   
• Complete infusion cessation due to intolerable side effect acceptability ratings by [CONTACT_583411] a minimum of every 4 -hours  from  the start of the 
ketamine infusion (t = 0) for 24 -hours  (12-hours post infusion cessation). Additional assessments 
will be administered between the [ADDRESS_766874] acceptability ratings, defined below 
Peripartum pain scores, defined in Appendix 1  
6 v.7.0   05/29/2024  Peripartum depression scores, defined by [CONTACT_583412] (EPDS)  
 
Side Effect Acceptability Ratings  
Any reported side effects  are rated by [CONTACT_1962]. Patient reported side effects (i.e., dizziness, 
lightheadedness, bad dreams, nausea, vomiting, itchiness, and hallucinations: all dichotomous outcomes) will be evaluated based on patient-specific reports of how “acceptable” or “unacceptable” the side effects are for continued or future use of the study medication. Patient-
reported acceptability is defined based on theoretical framework of acceptability
103 and focused 
on constructs of Burden (“Would experiencing side effects keep you from participating in this 
intervention (ketamine) again?” yes/no) and Affective Attitude (“Based on your experience 
with this medication, would you be willing to participate in this intervention (ketamine) 
again?” yes/no).  
1. Acceptability is the absence of patient- centered unacceptable side effects. Patients with 
side effects who report that the side effects were “acceptable” on digital diary will be counted as having confirmed side effect acceptability ratings, regardless of the presence 
of any side effects to the ketamine dose. Patient-reported acceptability is defined as a 
“yes” to Affective Attitude with a “no” to Burden. 
2. Unacceptability is any patient report of unacceptable side effects, defined as any 
positive response on the digital side effect diary rated unacceptable by [CONTACT_102]. 
Either  a negative response  to Attitude, or a positive response to Burden, will  define 
patient unacceptability.  
4 Research Design  
This is an open-label maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 3+[ADDRESS_766875] trimester of pregnancy, within 
approximately one  week of scheduled cesarean delivery , until 12 -weeks postpartum. 
 Preoperative weight and vital signs will be measured, and baseline inventories completed (Figure 1; refer to section 1.1). After delivery, cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_583356] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]~5-15 min after delivery; ±30 minutes), a loading infusion of ketamine 0.05 
mg/kg/hour will  begin for the first 3-patients in the study. Vital signs  and side effect symptomology  will 
be measured 15, 30, and 60 minutes (±5 minutes) after infusion start, and  at 4, 8, 10, 12 , 16, and  24 hours 
(±30 minutes) after infusion start. Plasma samples will be collected at 1, 6, 10, and 12 hours  (±30 minutes) 
after infusion . Any  report of adverse events or side effects will trigger a blood draw for analysis and 
correlation of these symptoms to plasma levels of ketamine within the [ADDRESS_766876] three patients will proceed based on the MTD protocol in Figure 2; refer to section 
1.1. 
 
MTD dosing protocol .  
7 v.7.0   05/29/2024  A loading dose and maintenance infusion  strategy will be used  (Figure 2 ; in section 1.1). MTD to be 
tested will focus  on the initial  loading dose used to achieve a higher plasma concentration in a brief 
period. Ketamine dose will not exceed sub -anesthetic ranges (≤0.2mg/kg/hr78). The maintenance rate of 
0.05mg/kg/hr is based on our preliminary data suggesting tolerability, and on data suggesting that this 
rate might yield adequate plasma concentrations necessary for the treatment of depression. The first 
set of 3 patients will receive a loading infusion of ketamine 0.05 mg/kg/hr for the first data. The decision to escalate the loading infusion dose, enter 3 more at the same level, or stop, will not occur 
until  3 patients  complete  the 0.05 mg/kg/hr  protocol. A  DLT  event  is defined  in section 3.4.1.

questions of sedation, LSD short form, dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hallucinations.  
 
6 Study Drug  
 
Ketalar (Ketamine) (C13H16ClNO, 2-(2-chlorophenyl) -2-(methylamino) cyclohexan -1-one) is a 
cyclohexanone derivative with known analgesic and anesthetic properties. It inhibits biogenic amine 
uptake, binds opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328], and inhibits N- methyl D- aspartate (NMDA) receptors. 
 
Ketamine will be used for post -cesarean delivery analgesia. Specifically, it will be evaluated for its role 
in pain reduction, opi[INVESTIGATOR_187481], and improved pain outcomes. In the non-obstetric surgical 
population, modalities such as intravenous ketamine are well -recog nized as effective adjuncts in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
reduction strategies for postoperative pain. Ketamine is used off-label as standard clinical care in 
perioperative pain management for patients with a history of complex pain such as people with chronic 
10 v.7.0   05/29/2024  pain (treated or untreated), a history of or current symptoms of depression and anxiety, current 
smokers, and women with opi[INVESTIGATOR_583359].  
 
Ketamine is an approved drug or biologic being  evaluated for a new indication, population, route of 
administration, or dosage level not specified in the FDA approved labeling.  
 
6.1
 Dose Selection  
 
Safety and Efficacy: Preclinical studies, including studies on animals, and clinical studies, including 
studies on non -pregnant women, have been conducted and provide reassuring data on minimal 
potential risks to postpartum women . [45 CFR 46.204 (a) ]. The selected reference list below demonstrates 
experience with this drug in dosing regimen s matching or exceeding the currently proposed dosing,  in 
both pregnant and postpartum people . The data support low risks to this population . In the dosing 
regimen that w e describe which is "sub -anesthetic" (i.e., ≤0.2 mg/kg/hr,  lower than the anesthetic dosing 
regimen s), we expect that the risks are sufficiently low to justify studying it in this fashion.

11 v.7.0   05/29/2024  6.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing  
 
The study drug, ketamine, will be sourced by [CONTACT_583414] (IDS) Pharmacy at UPMC  Magee Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The infusions will be packaged and labeled for use in the clinical research study per pharmacy 
protocols and guidelines. Ketamine will be prepared by [CONTACT_583415]. There will 
be no blinding.  
 
For on -site preparation and dispensing of the study drugs, the following procedures will be followed. 
The pharmacist of record will: maintain adequate records confirming receipt, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], or other 
disposition information on the investigational drug; they will record the name [CONTACT_583448], date, quantity, and batch number. They will secure the drug in a locked 
storage area and monitor to ensure proper storage conditions; they will also complete regular inventory 
to assure accurate indication of stock on hand, as well as proper recording of stock received, dispensed, 
and returned. For the patients  enrolled for open label pharmacokinetic studies, the pharmacist will 
generate a label prior to dispensing the study drug, including the date dispensed, quantity and 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_29605], drug strength and dose; they will affix the label to the dispensed drug. For 
dispensing and drug disposition recording, they will record the date dispensed, patient initials or other 
identifiers, drug treatments, quantity dispensed, initials of dispenser, date and amount of patient 
returns documented in study records (i. e., returned drug that cannot be re-dispensed). Filing and all 
drug documentation will occur within study records, medical records,  and logs.  
 
Following the cesarean delivery, the initial drug administration (via IV infusion) will begin 15 minutes 
(± 30 minutes) after cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_583362]/  hemodynamic stability by [CONTACT_583416].  The maintenance dose will start 60 min (range: +15min) after the initial 
loading dose. The infusion will be completely stopped [ADDRESS_766881] dose not tolerated . Our preliminary data suggests that only 1/8 (12.5%) of 
individuals received an  infusion  rate lower  than 0.05mg/kg/hr  due  to side  effects. However, these  data 
are not representative of our study population, so it is conceivable that PK or PD for side effects may 
differ in the immediate postpartum setting, and that the lowest loading dose may not be tolerated. If loading dose of 0.05mg/kg/hr is not tolerated, we will  follow the dose adjustments in Table  1 and Figure 
3 below.  
12 v.7.0   05/29/2024   
Event s that Trigger Dose Adjustment Procedures:  
• Persisting unresolved hemodynamic side effects defined as Systolic blood pressure <80 or >160, 
Heart rate <40 or >[ZIP_CODE]     
o Unresolved after 3 consecutive measurements within a 15-minute interval 
• Persisting (i.e., unresolved within 1 hour of onset) side effects sedation, dizziness, 
lightheadedness, persistent itchiness, bad dreams, hallucinations, or other side effects that are 
reported as not acceptable to patients or clinicians, despi[INVESTIGATOR_583363]. 
• Table 1 includes procedures for dose adjustments. 
 Patient Reported Side Effects Dose Delays or Adjustments  
• Side Effect Acceptability ratings are defined in section 3.4.2. Patient reported side effects (i.e., 
dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, nausea, vomiting, itchiness, and hallucinations: all are dichotomous outcomes). These side effects will be evaluated based on patient-specific reports of 
how “acceptable” or “unacceptable.” Patients reporting side effects and rating them as “unacceptable” will follow the dose delay or adjustment described in the Table  1. If side effects 
are rated “acceptable” then no dose delays or adjustments will occur.

6.4 Study Drug Storage and Accountability  
 
For on -site preparation and dispensing of the study drugs, the following procedures will be followed. 
The investigational drug (IDS) pharmacist of record will: maintain adequate records confirming receipt, 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], or other disposition information on the investigational drug; they will record the name 
[CONTACT_583449], date, quantity, and batch numb er. They will secure the 
drug in a locked storage area and monitor to ensure proper storage conditions; they will also comp lete 
regular inventory to assure accurate indication of stock on hand, as well as proper recording of stock 
received, dispensed, and returned. For the [ADDRESS_766885] will generate a label prior to dispensing the study drug, including the date dispensed, 
quantity and expi[INVESTIGATOR_29605], drug strength and dose; they will affix the label to the dispensed 
drug. Pharmacist will generate a label prior to dispensing the study drug, including the date dispensed, 
quantity and expi[INVESTIGATOR_29605]; they will affix the label to the dispensed drug; they will record but 
not disclose on the label the drug strength and dose. For dispensing and drug disposition recording, 

15 v.7.0   05/29/[ADDRESS_766886] the date dispensed, patient initials or other identifiers, drug treatments, quantity 
dispensed, initials of dispenser, date and amount of patient returns documented in study records (i.e., 
returned drug that cannot be re -dispensed). Filing and all drug documentation will occur within study 
records and IDS logs.  During the infusion, the ketamine will be stored in a lockbox and all Magee 
standard of care procedures for the safety of controlled substances will be in place for the use of 
ketami ne from the start of infusion through the end of the infusion in the postpartum unit.

7 Research Activities  
 
Figure 1 (section 1.1) illustrates all encounters for measurements at the preoperative baseline, during the 
intraoperative period, ketamine infusion period, in the postpartum hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (or until patient 
discharge), and the [ADDRESS_766888] 1 week apart, prior to delivery. The baseline 
measures are repeated weekly in the postpartum period until 12-weeks postpartum.   
 
16 v.7.0   05/29/2024  During the ketamine infusion, blood samples will be taken at 1-, 6-, 10- , & 12-hours post-infusion start, 
as well as at the time of any adverse side effect report to assess ketamine/metabolite levels at the time of 
event.   
 
Baseline (Preoperative) Procedures.   
a. Demographic Data and Medical History.  Demographic data will be collected through self -
reported questions through the RedCap interface.   Data from the medical record will be 
extracted and recorded by [CONTACT_583418]. 
Individual surveys are transposed into RedCap for ease of patient use either on a tablet or paper when patients are in person, and via text or email-linked surveys for remote responses. Survey 
measure timepoints are described in  the Appendix . 
b. Surveys .   Patient-reported measures will occur by [CONTACT_583419], 
tablet (in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), or via Mosio text-based interface with data integration via REDCap. Texting and email will be used via patient- preferred cellular phone numbers and emai l addresses for 12-
weekly  postpartum assessments. Each weekly assessment will occur within ± [ADDRESS_766889] between 15- and 20-minutes, except for the postoperative timepoints which are expected to 
take less than 15-minutes to complete. Specific surveys and timeline of surveys will be as follows and as indicated in Table 1 and Figure 1.  
 Intraoperative Procedures: Day of S urgery   
 
Standardized Surgical, Anesthesia and Analgesia Protocols   
Surgical personnel role will be recorded (e.g., titles such as private vs faculty obstetricians, 
resident, or physician assistant). Standardized spi[INVESTIGATOR_583365]. Intraoperative medications include current clinical standards of prophylactic 
phenylephrine infusion to reduce hypotension and related intraoperative nausea/vomiting; ondansetron at the time of delivery for postpartum nausea/vomiting prophylaxis; and ketorolac 
15-30 mg at the time of facial closur e. Rescue analgesia and antiemetics will follow our existing 
clinical protocols.   
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227] m edications: bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.75% 1.6mL with fentanyl 10- 15mcg and morphine 
100-150mcg.  
 
Co-medications :  
• Per clinical routine, prophylactic phenylephrine infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min (37.5mL/hr 
at standard concentrations) will be started at the beginning of spi[INVESTIGATOR_583366]. 
• Supplemental vasopressor boluses are delivered at the full discretion of the managing 
anesthesi ology tea m. 
• Ondansetron 4mg IVP for PONV prophylaxis  
• Dexamethasone 4mg IVP for PONV prophylaxis unless contraindications  
• Acetaminophen 1000mg either orally pre -operatively or  IVPB at f acial closure  
17 v.7.0   05/29/2024  • Ketorolac 15 -30mg IVP at facial closure 
 
Rescue intraoperative antiemetic:  Ondansetron 4mg IVP as a rescue dose as needed x1 dose; 
dexamethasone 4 -6mg IVP as needed x1 dose; after this, additional rescue antiemetic can be 
given at the full discretion of the managing anesthesia team. 
 
Postpartum Analgesia Protocol 
Postpartum analgesia protocols will be aligned with routine clinical practice at UPMC Magee-
Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Specifically, ketorolac 30 mg IV q6h x24 hours (total of 4 doses) will be administered. After all doses of ketorolac have been given, ibuprofen 600mg q6h x24 hours will 
be delivered, not to be given within [ADDRESS_766890] dose given on postoperative day 0. For 
severe breakthrough pain rated 7-10 on VAS, the Investigator will be called to assess the need 
to order oxycodone 5 -10mg if necessary, as n eeded for severe breakthrough pain. The 
Investigator may also assess the need for parenteral rescue agents, namely hydromorphone. 
 Discharge Analgesia Regimen  
Consistent with current routine clinical practice at UPMC Magee, subjects will be discharged 
with a prescription for oxycodone 5 -10mg q6h #12-[ADDRESS_766891]  (Table 3) . Surgeon s will complete the Surgeon Operative Survey (Table 2) described

Preoperative weight and vital signs will be measured, and baseline inventories completed 
(Figure 1). After delivery, cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_583368] ( approximately 5-15 min utes after delivery , ± 30 minutes),  a loading infusion of 
ketamine 0.05 mg/kg/hr will begin for the first 3-patients in the study. Vital signs  and Richmond  
Agitation  Sedation Scale  (RASS) , and self-reports of side effects will be measured 15, 30, and 60 
minutes (±10 minutes) after infusion start, and at 4- 8- 10- 12 - 16- 24- hours (± 30 minutes) after 
infusion start. Plasma samples will be collected at 1- 6-, 10- and 12- hours  (±30 minutes) after  
infusion  start via a n indwelling IV catheter to facilitate ease of access. Plasma samples at 1- 6-, 10- 
and 12- hours  after infusion  start will be used to calculate Cmax, AUC, and Css and to correlate 
DLTs with these PK parameters. Any report of adverse events or side effects will trigger a blood draw for analysis and correlation of these symptoms to plasma levels of ketamine. All assessments have been timed to coincide with timing intervals of typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396] -CD clinical care 
interventions. Patient dosing after the first three patients will proceed based on the MTD protocol in Section 1.1. 
 
MTD Dose Adjustment Procedures.  
Figure 2  (section 1.1) outlines the dosing approach. Dose adjustment procedures are outlined in 
section 6.3. 
 
 
Side Effect Acceptability Ratings.  
Our existing and previously tested digital diary will automate alerts for questions about side 
effects after infusion start at 15- , 30-, 60- minutes, and every [ADDRESS_766898] 24 hours after 
infusion start (Figure 1 , section 1.1). The diary has been tested and used by [CONTACT_583420]; alerts coincide  with RASS assessments and similar timing of clinical 
assessments for routine CD nursing care and monitoring (i.e., is not more burdensome or 
intrusive to patients than routine clinical post-CD care). The digital diary will assess side effects 
19 v.7.0   05/29/2024  (i.e., dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, nausea, vomiting, itchiness, and hallucinations: 
all dichotomous outcomes). Any positive response to any item will trigger the subject to rate 
their acceptability of side effects in the following way. Patient- reported acceptability is defined 
based on theoretical framework of acceptability103 and focused on constructs of Burden (“Would 
experiencing side effects keep you from participating in this intervention (ketamine)  again?” 
yes/no) and Affective Attitude  (“Based on your experience with this medication, would you be 
willing to participate in this intervention (ketamine) again?” yes/no). Either  a negative response 
to Attitude, or a positive response to Burden, will  define patient unacceptability.  
 Side Effects .  
Monitoring during the infusion will follow our clinical standards of perioperative ketamine  
monitoring.  A maternal side effect  digital  diary  will also be used. The digital diary has been 
previously  developed  and tested in our  preliminary  lactation volunteer study. The diary alerts 
questions to patients includ e the Richmond agitation -sedation scale (RASS)
104, dysphoria (LSD 
short form105), and side effects. Automated alerts for abnormal responses  go to clinical and 
research  staff for immediate  action. Any report  of side effects  will trigger a blood draw for 
analysis and correlation to measured plasma levels.  
 Postpartum 12 -week Follow -up Procedures.  
Figure 1 (section 1.1)  outlines weekly follow- up procedures. Participants will receive weekly 
surveys containing the questionnaires that are specified in Appendix 1. Surveys focus on pain and depression symptoms  throughout the postpartum period.  
 
7.1 Screening Procedures  
Per our existing research procedures, patients will be screened from the Magee -Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583369]. Screening will be completed using the “Core 
Surgical PowerChart” and “Epic” Electronic Health Record ( EHR) systems. All procedures will follow 
existing  processes with clinicians for patient enrollment in research. Patients scheduled for CD are 
contact[CONTACT_583421], explain the study protocol, and 
provide consent.  Patients who are eligible within the prenatal  clinics will be contact[CONTACT_583422] , via a MyUPMC message or u sing videoconferencing to explain the study and obtain consent.  
 7.[ADDRESS_766899] has declared hemodynamic stability (i.e., infusion starts approximately 5- 15 
minutes after delivery, ± 30 minutes ). The infusion will be completely stopped at 12 hours after the start 
of infusion. The same infusion pump will follow the patient throughout the postoperative period for 12 
hours until completion of the study drug. No manipulation of the infusion pump wil l occur by [CONTACT_941] 
20 v.7.0   05/29/[ADDRESS_766900] 
orders from the study team.  
 
7.4
 Safety Assessments/Procedures During Treatment  
Maternal monitoring during the infusion will follow our clinical standards perioperative ketamine 
monitoring and the standard Magee system safety precautions for administration of a controlled 
substance will be in place to protect from any misuse. A licensed and qualified anesthesia provider  
(resident, fellow, nurse anesthetists, or anesthesiologist) will be present during the first [ADDRESS_766901] the option to treat blood pressures >180/100 mm Hg or heart rate >110 bpm. 
The study infusion will be discontinued if 3 consecutive measurements within a 15-minute interval 
remain above protoco l-defined limits despi[INVESTIGATOR_369473] (section 6.3). Maternal side effect 
symptomology monitoring will occur throughout the  ketamine infusion. Automated alerts for 
maternal side effect responses go to clinical and research staff for immediate action. Any report of side 
effects will trigger a blood draw for analysis and correlation to measured plasma levels.  
 
An independent DSMB will define frequency of monitoring of tolerability  and DLT data.  The severity 
of adverse events are classified in section 10.1  
 
7.5
 Safety Assessments/Procedures After Ketamine Infusion Stop  
Maternal side effect monitoring following the infusion will continue at 4-hour intervals for 12-
hour s after the cessation of ketamine infusion. Monitoring will occur via clinical staff monitoring 
and via patient self -report indices of side effect symptomology (Figure 1; section 1.1).  
After the study drug infusion is complete, safety and efficacy assessments consist of the following. 
D
igital diaries will assess self-reported side effects according to the study schematic Figure 1; 1.1, until 
12 hours after infusion discontinuation. Vital signs will be monitored during that same period.  
 
 
7.6 Safety Assessments/Procedures During Postpartum Surveys  
Efficacy assessments, exploratory in nature, will consist of pain and depression symptom screening at 
regular intervals from one week postpartum until 12 weeks after delivery, according to the time 
intervals indicated in the study schematic F igure  1; 1.1. Positive screens for depression will be initiate  
an immediate response to the study team. The protocol for positive depression screens is presented in Appendix 4. All patients who screen positive for depression (EPDS total score > 14 or positive answer 
to question #10) will be contact[CONTACT_583423].  
 After all study procedures are complete [ADDRESS_766902] access to their 
primary care physicians and emergency services.  
 
8 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
21 v.7.0   05/29/2024  8.1 Reasonably Foreseeable Risks Related to Study Drug 
 
Common side effects of ketamine are sedation, dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, hallucinations, euphoria,  dysphoria,  nausea, vomiting. These risks are minimized by [CONTACT_583424][INVESTIGATOR_583370]. Seriousness: mild  to moderate.  
 Uncommon effects of ketamine include hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, or bradycardia. These 
risks are minimized as much as possible by [CONTACT_583425][INVESTIGATOR_583371]. If these effects are noted, the drug will be stopped until the effects dissipate. Should the effects not dissipate, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_583372]. If these 
uncommon effects are experienced, an SAE log will be completed and the IDSMB and IRB notified. 
Seriousness: mild to  moderate

9.2 Management of research related risks 
 
23 v.7.0   05/29/2024  All research interventions/activities will be conducted in private patient care areas. The collection of 
sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of the 
research, so that no unneeded sensitive information is collected .  
  
All demographic and clinical information about the subject will be stored in an electronic password-
guarded study database under the supervision of the Investigator for this protocol. The electronic system REDCap has features that can enable its use as cer tifiably compliant with the DFTA regulations 
at [ADDRESS_766905] proection on computers in locked areas, with access to the database manager. Access to the database will be limited to the data manager and staff under the supervision of the Investigator.  
  
All staff involved in this study are properly credentialed and instructed in the areas of testing, confidentiality, and safety.  All study team members will be properly trained on protocol requirements , 
trained in HIPA A/privacy procedures, and GCPs . Research procedures performed for study purposes 
will be performed by [CONTACT_583430], experience, and/or training.  All members of the study team will have the required human subjects and confidentiality training, which 
includes information about maintaining data integrity and security. Confidentiality will be guarded 
using established procedures such as storing data in locked cabinets within locked offices or locked data rooms, coding CRFs and research specimens by [CONTACT_583431], and aggregating data across 
participants. The key linking names and study identification numbers will be kept separately from the data sets with limited access by [CONTACT_3462]. Only study personnel will have access to the data sets 
on protected servers. 
 The Investigator will retain the data for the entire period of this study and will retain the specified 
records and reports for up to seven years after the study’s publication. The Investigator may continue to 
use and disclose subjects’ de -identified infor mation for the purpose of this study for a minimum of 
seven years after final reporting or publication of the study. If the subject and/or legal representative 
decide to withdraw or be withdrawn from study participation, they may request in writing that th e 
study data and samples be destroyed. Subject names or other directly identifiable information will not 
appear on any reports, publications, or other disclosures of clinical study outcomes.  
  
Clinical data recorded on the electronic database will include intraoperative obstetrician case report forms completed by [CONTACT_583432], and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583373].  
 
10 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
24 v.7.0   05/29/2024  The proposed clinical trial will use the FDA definition of an adverse event (AE). Adverse event means 
any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether considered 
drug related.   
 
The proposed clinical trial will use the FDA definition of SAE.  A serious adverse event is any untoward 
clinical event that is thought by [CONTACT_583433]: 
 
1. Death 
2. A life -threatening adverse event  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] 
4. A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5. A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
6. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient, or subject, and may require medical, or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above. 
 
Adverse events will be assessed on each participant at stated intervals in Figure 2 section 1.1, both during infusion, and for 12 hours after infusion discontinuation. Duration of monitoring is based on known pharmacokinetics of ketamine.  
 When an adverse event is discovered, the event will be assessed for severity, relatedness, and expectedness.  All adverse events will be documented in the research records and followed until 
resolved or back to baseline grade.  
 
10.1 Severity 
 
The severity of adverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be classified as follows: 
 • Grade 1 (Mild ): asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation only; 
intervention not indicated. 
o e.g., sedation, dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, hallucinations, euphoria, dysphoria,  nausea, vomiting 
• Grade 2 (Moderate):  minimal, local,  or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate ADL.  
o e.g., dysphoria, vomiting  
• Grade 3 (Severe):  medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self- care/ADL.  
o e.g., hypertensive urgency or emergency requiring escalated or inpatient treatment 
• Grade 4 (Life -threatening):  consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
o e.g., stroke from uncorrected severe hypertension  
25 v.7.0   05/29/2024  • Grade 5 (Death):  event is a direct cause of death.   
 
An independent DSMB will define frequency of monitoring of the tolerability and DLT data.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_766906] to the following criteria to determine the 
relatedness of the experienced event to the research study, protocol, and/or drug.  
 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event occurs in a plausible time relationship to 
study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the drug is  clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitiv e. 
 
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concur rent disease or other drugs or chemicals 
and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal of the study drug.   
 
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the study medication). However, other factors may 
have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). 
Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more infor mation and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as 
appropriate.  
 
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event  whose temporal relationship to study intervention 
administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments). 
 
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is related to another etiology. There will be an alternative, definitive 
etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
10.3 Expectedness 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_118631].  
An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the  information previously described (sections 8.2 and 9.1). Note that the risks listed in Section 8.1 
are considered expected and would not  require reporting unless  the frequency or severity is greater than 
expected.  Events not listed in Section 8.1 but that are listed in the FDA -approved packa ge insert , should 
26 v.7.0   05/29/[ADDRESS_766907] be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of discovery of the incident with subsequent follow-up submission of a detailed written report. The IDSMB and IRB will be notified by [CONTACT_497563] a human adverse event that is fatal or life-threatening no later than 7 calendar 
days after receiving the respective human adverse event information, followed by [CONTACT_583434] a written IND Safety Report. Serious and unexpected adverse events associated with the use of the study drug or procedures will be reported to the IRB with subsequent follow -up submission 
of a detailed written report in accordance with the respective p olicies and procedures of the IRB. A 
summary report of the findings will be prepared and submitted to the regulatory agencies.  A written 
IND Safety Report (i.e., Form FDA 3500A) will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no 
event, later than 15 calendar days following the investigator-sponsor’s receipt of the respective adverse event information.  
 
A summary of the SAEs that occurred during the previous year will be included in the FDA annual 
progress report as well as in the annual IRB continuing review.

DSMB will review all events pertaining to participant withdrawals. An independent decision will be 
made regarding trial discontinuation based on risk assessment for current and future trial participants. 
 Withdrawn participants will be replaced at a proportion of 1:1. Procedures are as follows:  
• Study personnel, investigators, and pharmacy will be informed of the need for replacement due to participant withdrawal.  
• Subsequent data to be collected from the withdrawn participant will be restricted to the 
minimum amount necessary to continue to monitor safety, i.e., side effect diary including 
questions of sedation, LSD short form, dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hallucinations.  
  
11.2 Other Criteria Requiring Discontinuation  
 
Withdrawal of Subjects for reasons other than Non- compliance or Adverse Events:   
• Protocol non -adherence: incorrect dosing strategy or other non -adherence points at the 
judgement of the PI   
• Incomplete side effect diary data, defined as missing 20% or more responses   
Withdrawn participants will be replaced at a proportion of 1:1. Procedures are as follows:  
• Study personnel, investigators, DSMB will be informed of the need for replacement due to participant withdrawal.  
28 v.7.0   05/29/2024  • Subsequent data to be collected from the withdrawn participant will be restricted to the 
minimum amount necessary to continue to monitor safety, i.e., side effect diary including 
questions of sedation, LSD short form, dizziness, lightheadedness, bad dreams, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hallucinations.  
 
11.3 Clinical Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_583374] , or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. DSMB 
will review all events pertaining to participant withdrawals. An independent decision will be made 
regarding trial discontinuation based on risk assessment for current and future trial participants. 
 Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by 
[CONTACT_206092],  or terminating party to study participants, investigators, funding agency, the IND 
sponsor,  and regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_583375], the IRB, and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of 
changes to t he study  visit schedule. 
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: 
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
• Determination that the primary endpoint has been met 
• Determination of futility  
 
Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, and data quality are addressed, 
and satisfy the sponsor, IRB and/or FDA. 
 
12 Statistical Analysis  
By [CONTACT_583436], the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 3+3 design encompasses a minimum 
number of 6 and maximum number of 12 patients enrolled in this trial. The results identify the drug dose at which ≥33% of patients experience dose limiting toxicity,  which we have defined by 
[CONTACT_583437]. The number of subjects at each dose is dictated by [CONTACT_583438] 3+[ADDRESS_766910] experiences in greater than 66% of patients. 
  
29 v.7.0   05/29/2024  12.2 Sample Size Determination  
The number of subjects (minimum of 6; maximum of 12) at each dose is dictated by [CONTACT_583438] 3+3 
design, balancing the risks associated with the study drug and the assessment of adverse event rates. A 
formal power calculation was not performed.  
 
12.3 A
nalysis of Primary Endpoint  
 
Maximum Tolerated (Ketamine) Dose (MTD): The MTD will be defined as the dose at which fewer 
than 33% of patients experience  intolerable effects.  
Tolerability (dichotomous Yes/No)  
• Tolerability  (YES) will be defined  as: lack  of serious  adverse events (serious adverse event 
defined as: severe unresolved hemodynamic effect: systolic blood pressure <80 or >160, heart 
rate <40 or >120).33 
• Lack of Tolerability  will be defined as presence of any serious adverse event (i.e., severe 
unresolved hemodynamic effect: systolic blood pressure <80 or >160, heart rate <40 or >120).[ADDRESS_766911] (IDSMB) will be convene d prior to initiation of the studies and administrated 
by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_583376]. The study will be reviewed a minimum of quarterly in the first year and twice yearly on an annual basis (or more frequently as deemed necessary) by [CONTACT_68401]. The IDSMB will determine the actual frequency of meetings and monitoring, including convening of 
emergency meetings when necessary.   
  
The Institutional Review Board (IRB) will approve the Statement of Informed Consent for the study and 
provide institutional oversight of data and safety issues. The study protocol will be approved by [CONTACT_583439] y participants.   
  
30 v.7.0   05/29/[ADDRESS_766912] the required human subjects and confidentiality training, which 
includes information about maintaining data integrity and secu rity. Confidentiality will be guarded 
using established procedures such as storing data in locked cabinets within locked offices or locked data 
rooms, electronic data stored behind UPMC/university firewalls and/or use of REDCap with attendant 
compliance with data safety standards, coding by [CONTACT_583440], and aggregating data across participants. The key linking names and study identification numbers will be kept separately 
from the data sets with limited access by [CONTACT_3462]. Only study personnel will have access to the 
data sets on protected servers. Oversight of all aspects of data management will occur with the Investigator.  
 
13.2 Parameters to be Monitored  
 
The following progress will be monitored throughout the course of the research to ensure the safety of subjects as well as the integrity and confidentiality of their data.  
• An evaluation of the progress of the research study, including subject recruitment and retention, and an assessment of the timeliness and quality of the data.  
• A review of collected data (including adverse events, unanticipated problems, and subject 
withdrawals) to determine whether there is a change to the anticipated benefit -to-risk 
assessment of study participation and whether the study should continue as orig inally designed, 
should be changed, or should be terminated (see section 10.1) .  
• An assessment of external factors or relevant information (e.g., pertinent scientific literature 
reports or therapeutic development, results of related studies) that may have an impact on the safety and study participants or the ethics of the research study.  
• A review of study procedures designed to protect the privacy of the research subjects and the confidentiality of their research data.  
31 v.7.0   05/29/[ADDRESS_766913] safety data as it is generated. The Investigator and the research staff 
will meet on a weekly interval – and more frequently as necessary – to review data coding and capture, 
documentation and identification of adverse events, complaints or other issues, and subject confidentiality issues. There will be an evaluation of the progress of the research study, including 
assessments of data quality, timelines, participant recruitment, accrual, and retention. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_583377]-to-risk ratio of study participation and whether the study 
should continue as originally designed or should it be re- evaluated and changed.

32 v.7.0   05/29/2024  14 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight  
 
14.1 IRB Approval  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_562666], from the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_68348], prospective approval of the clinical protocol 
and corresponding informed consent form(s); modifications to the clinical protocol and corresponding 
informed consent forms, and advertisements (i.e., directed at potential research subjects) for study 
recruitment.     
The only circumstance in which a deviation from the current IRB- approved clinical protocol/consent 
form(s) may be initiated in the absence of prospective IRB approval is to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to the research subject(s).  In such circumstances, the Investigator will promptly 
notify the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187588].  
 The IRB will review and approve the Informed Consent Document for the study and provide 
institutional oversight of data and safety issues. The study protocol will be approved prior to recruiting 
or obtaining consent from any participants. Moreover, the stu dy will be reviewed at a minimum of 
annual basis (or more frequently as deemed necessary) by [CONTACT_187602].   Each participant will 
sign the approved Informed Consent Form prior to participating in the study.

14.2 Informed Consent Procedures  
 
Details of Participant Recruitment:  
Subjects approached for enrollment in this study are patients being seen during normal clinical care or 
by [CONTACT_583441]. Screening will occur by [CONTACT_583442], or obstetric operating room schedule, or in the labor and delivery suite. After review, potential patients 
scheduled for elective cesarean delivery will be approached after clinical staff confirm it is appropriate 
to do so. For scheduled elective cesarean deliveries, participants will be contact[CONTACT_583443], within 0- 21 days prior to the scheduled delivery, to disclose eligibility in the study 
and to assess their desire to speak to the study team to learn more about the study. The anesthesia team will see all patients presenting for cesarean delivery. During this visit, the anesthesia team typi[INVESTIGATOR_583378]’s medical history, explains the anesthetic plan, and obtains consent for anesthesia. In 
this study, for eligible participants, investigators will also use this visit to explain the availability of the 
study to the patient meeting eligibility criteria , when the anesthesiology consult occurs . Should the 
patient wish to hear more, researchers will discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to study 
participation. Questions will be answered, and time will be afforded to patients per the Informed 
consent Procedures outlined below, minimizing risks of coercion or undue influence.   
 
Recruitment will also occur using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]+Me ( https://pi[INVESTIGATOR_583379].org/ ) and study fliers within the OBGYN 
clinics at Magee Womens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Interested individuals will contact [CONTACT_116194]. Screening 
33 v.7.0   05/29/[ADDRESS_766916] in participating in the study. For women wi th 
scheduled cesarean delivery, a phone call with the investigator 0-21 days ahead of time will disclose eligibility and to assess their desire to speak to the study team to learn more about the study. Face-to-face (video and audio) virtual informed consent will be permitted if acceptable to both patient and 
investigator team, and will follow existing procedures, security and protection protocols that are 
currently used in our other research protocols.    
 
Patients will be offered additional time to consider the study and their desire to participate - the amount 
of time for them to consider will be determined by [CONTACT_583444]. They will be informed that they do not need to make any decisions in that encounter and will 
be encouraged to take time to consider and discuss the study with their support persons without the 
presence of study personnel. Blank informed consent documents and study brochures will be made available to the subjects and their support people, to support their deliberations.    
 
Individuals will be provided with full explanation of study -related goals and procedures. Questions will 
be answered for the patient as well as their support people. Patients will be given as much time as they 
desire to read the consent form and materials and ask questions. If desired, patients can take materials 
home for review and will be consented to participate via videoconferencing software and electronic consent via REDCap. 
 
Informed consent procedures will be followed and written informed consent will be obtained. No elements of informed consent will be waived.   
 
14.[ADDRESS_766917] the study 
protocol, applicable regulations and relevant GCP principles. Deviations in the study protocol will be identified  verbally and in writing to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or study coordinator as they occur. In addition to 
deviations noticed during completion of study protocol procedures, deviations may be identified through routine monitoring visits or audits of the clinical research records , as the research team will 
meet weekly to review the study recruitment, procedures, and retention . All deviations will be verified 
and presented to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187590], if warranted. Any deviation, regardless of severity, will be recorded in the Non -compliance/deviation log  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_583380]. Protocol deviations that do not meet the definition of IRB repo rting requirements will be 
subject to yearly review and evaluation during the continuing review period.  
34 v.7.0   05/29/2024   
Deviations determined to be reportable to the IRB include Unanticipated Problems involving risk to 
p
articipants, Serious Non- compliance with study protocol, and/or Continuing Non -compliance of study 
protocol. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_583381] -compliance within 10 working days of the Investigator becoming 
aware of the Reportable New Information.  Unanticipated Problems involving risk to participants  include 
adverse medica l occurrences that are: 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency; AND 
• Related, or possibly related, to a subject’s participation in the research; AND  
• Places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Any protocol deviation that results in an Adverse Events which are unexpected, fatal, or life-
threatening, and related or possibly Related to the Research Intervention will be immediately reported 
to the PI, Clinical Research Coordinator, and reported to the IRB within 24 hours of learning of the 
event. (All other internal Adverse Events that meet the definition of an Unanticipated Problem 
Involving Risk to Human Subjects or Others will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_766918] of the study, and any conclusions or 
changes to the study necessary for continuation, modification, or termination of the study.  
Reportable incidence of Non -c ompliance includes any protocol deviation that:  
• Significantly adversely affects the safety, rights, or welfare of the research participants; OR 
• Significantly compromises the quality or integrity of the research data (i.e., negatively impacts 
the ability to draw conclusions from the study data); OR 
• Represents Continuing Non -compliance (i.e., has been previously reported or represents a 
pattern of ongoing non -compliance).  
Incidents of Non- compliance that do not meet the IRB reporting requirements  will be documented in 
a Non -compliance/deviation log and managed as part of the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. The  Non -
compliance/deviation log will be kept throughout the study and the  documentation will be made 
available upon request.

  Appendix 1 – Surveys Measures  
 
Item  Description, Rationale and Evidence  
Demographic information  Age, gravidity, parity, estimated gestational age at delivery, weight (kg), height (cm), BMI (kg/m2) 
Estimated blood volume on day of surgery (calculated by [CONTACT_583447]):  
     EBV = 65ml x weight (kg)      non- obese  
     EBV = 50ml x weight (kg)     obese BMI ≥30  
Smoking status (yes/no), number of prior cesarean deliveries, race/ethnicity, highest level of education, and household income will be self -reported by [CONTACT_1766]. These items relate to social correlates of health that are not 
otherwise obtainable by [CONTACT_150499]. If differences in these characteristics are observed between  groups, a regression 
model will control for these factors (see statistical analysis plan).  
Edinburgh Postnatal 
Depression Scale  
(EPDS)  The EPDS is self -completed, 10 -item scale specifically for women in the perinatal period. It has been shown to be 
an effective means of identifying patients at risk for depression138,139.  
PROMIS Inventories  PROMIS inventories assess core aspects of pain. PROMIS -PI: [INVESTIGATOR_583405] s external 
manifestations of pain including social role participation and pain interference (i.e., pain behavior) . They are 
valid and reliable for the constructs that they assess (143 -145).  
Pain intensity 
(numeric rating scale)  This question assesses the somatic pain experience.  
 
Question: Over the last 24 hours, how intense has your pain been? Please rate on the scale below.  
0-10 numeric rating scale where 0 is “no intensity at all” and 10 is “the most intense pain I can imagine”  
Pain unpleasantness 
(numeric rating scale)  This question assesses the emotional pain experience, the emotional valence of pain.  
 
Question: Over the last 24 hours, how unpleasant has your pain been? Please rate on the scale below  
0-10 numeric rating scale where 0 is “not unpleasant at all” and 10 is “the most unpleasant pain I can imagine”  
McGill Pain 
Questionnaire, Short 
Form (SF -MPQ)  The McGill Pain Questionnaire Short Form measures multiple dimensions of pain experience including sensory 
and affective aspects140,141. The instrument is psychometrically sound, valid, reliable, and has good 
discriminative capacity142. These measures are necessary to better understand the role that these factors play in pain intensity, quality, and duration.  
Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS)  Psychological stress/distress affects pain, post -operative recovery, and depression. It will be measured in these 
populations using the validated Perceived Stress Scale.   
Daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_583406], daily average (avg) and maximum (max) p ill use counts  
“Over the last week, how many opi[INVESTIGATOR_583407]?”  
“Over the last week, what was the highest number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_583408]?”  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (milligram 
morphine equivalent, 
MME)  We will measure oxycodone, hydromorphone and morphine (mg) totals  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . These medications will be 
converted to a single variable, milligram morphine equivalent (MME), per information from the Center for 
Disease Control

 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Title:   Nudges and Incentives to Enhance the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_466373] [ADDRESS_597996] er, but many 
require special training beyond a professional degree.  In addition,  
the complex comorbidities and life circumstances faced by [CONTACT_466396][INVESTIGATOR_466374] a nd treat 
individuals needing these services. To date, of North Carolina’s 
8087 primary care physicians, 4669 nurse practitioners, and 4237 
physician assistants, only 785 (<5%) have undergone the waiver 
training required to provide medication assisted treat ment (MAT) 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], a miniscule number of North Carolina’s 
primary care workforce. Many waiver -trained providers are not yet 
prescribing, due in part to the lack of on -going education or  
support, so the effective rate of treatment provision  is substantially 
lower than 5%. Further, only one -fifth of NC’s zip codes have a 
waiver -trained provider. ECHO is an evidence -supported hub -and-
spoke model of professional development that uses video 
conferencing technology to bring experts into even the most rural 
areas to support primary care providers. ECHO for MAT is program 
in NC that uses the ECHO model to develop a provider workforce 
that is equipped to provide MAT to those in need of treatment, 
preventing further accidental deaths from overdose. Th e time 
commitment required to develop MAT proficiency can prove to be 
a barrier to take up since provider time participating in ECHO may 
represent lost revenue from not seeing patients. This challenge can 
especially prohibit participation from small and ru ral practices, 
often where treatment is most needed.  This research project will 
conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_466375] a provider’s 
community into recruitment materials (Aim 1) and  financial 
incentives (Aim 2) affect participation in ECHO MAT by [CONTACT_242447]. Through these estimates, this study will contribute 
much -needed information on the incentives that can be used to 
create a behavioral health workforce that is ready t o meet the 
challenges of  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].

Study Phases  
Screening  
Study Treatment  
Follow -Up   (1) Recruitment : recruitment materials (l etters or emails) sent 
once randomized to 1 of 4 conditions.  Once participant 
enrolls, then  
(2) Randomization  to 1 of 3 study arms:   enrolled participants are 
re-randomized to 1 of 3 levels of reimbursement to estimate 
the influence of financial incentives in participation in learning 
collaboratives to address the opi[INVESTIGATOR_466378].   
Participation in learning collaboratives over 6 months will be

 tracked.   Participation in learning collaboratives will be tracked 
over 9 months for participants who did not complete as of 
3/9/[ADDRESS_598000] of eligible NC providers generated from the 
NPI [CONTACT_66082], limiting to primary care providers identified through  
taxonomy codes, which gives more than 90% power to detect a ten  
percentage point difference in the binary outcome, response to 
study recruitment. We will use binary models (logit, linear 
probability models) to examine response to recruitment as a 
function of study arm, controlling for provider type and county  
fixed effects.    
For Aim 2, we will randomly recruit up to [ADDRESS_598001] 20 providers per arm  enrollees for this phase of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (20 providers per arm).   The outcome to b e monitored for 
Aim [ADDRESS_598002] a negative binom ial or other 
count data model (depending on statistical tests) of the number of 
sessions as a function of financial incentive arm to estimate the 
effect of financial incentives on participation.  
DATA AND SAFETY 
MONITORING PLAN The risk to participants is minimal, and this does not meet the 
definition of a clinical trial, thus there is no data safety monitoring 
plan.  
 
  
Nudges and Incentives to Enhance the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_466365]  
 
[ADDRESS_598003] are:  
Aim 1: To estimate the influence of informational nudges on the engagement of primary care providers 
in an opi[INVESTIGATOR_466379]. Primary care 
providers in North Carolina, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, will be 
randomly assigned to receive either a pro -social recruitment approach for participating in the UNC 
ECHO MAT intervention or standard recruitment practice. Treatment assignment will provide pro -social 
informa tion, including customized figures on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_466380]’s region and the 
degree of the provider shortage in their region. The comparison arm will include a standard approach to 
recruitment that does not contain a pro -social recruitmen t message. Analysis of this data will provide 
estimates of the degree of responsiveness of providers to informational nudges.  
Aim 2: To estimate the influence of financial incentives on the participation intensity of primary care 
providers in an opi[INVESTIGATOR_466381]. At the 
second stage, providers agreeing to enroll in the program will be re -randomized to one of three levels of 
reimbursement for time spent participating in the UNC ECHO MAT interventi on. Analysis of this data will 
provide causal estimates of the degree of responsiveness of provider participation intensity to financial 
incentives. A sub -aim will examine whether the effect of incentives on participation intensity varies 
between the pro -social recruitment group and status -quo recruitment group. The results from this study 
will inform the feasibility and design of a full -scale trial testing the effects and cost -effectiveness of 
approaches to address the shortage of adequately trained primar y care clinicians, providing urgently 
needed information on best practices in developi[INVESTIGATOR_466382].  
1.[ADDRESS_598004] seeks to examine a critical barrier to op timizing the health care workforce for  the treatment 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537]. Without a dramatic increase in the number of primary care providers trained 
and comfortable with the many nuances of prescribing medication -assisted treatment (MAT), the 
staggering increases in opi[INVESTIGATOR_466383]. However, Drug Addiction 
Treatment Act (DATA) 2000 waiver training alone is not enough to facilitate prescribing for patients who 
desperately need services; an estimated 40% of physicians with waivers do not initiate MAT 
prescrip tions. To address this problem, North Carolina developed a learning collaborative framework to 
promote MAT training.   Learning collaboratives have been shown to be an efficacious approach to 
increase utilization of MAT, but engagement among providers in No rth Carolina has been low. To date, 
the need to encourage provider collaborative participation at scale has not been addressed. This is the       
critical problem focused on in this study .        
The death rate from accidental opi[INVESTIGATOR_466384], with       
overdose deaths in [ADDRESS_598005] five times the number from 1999. The daily death rate from opi[INVESTIGATOR_466385] U.S. alone is now estimated at 115, so every day that evidence -based treatment is not 
available leads t o more preventable deaths. North Carolina is one of the  states with both an opi[INVESTIGATOR_466386] (11.9 vs 10.4 deaths per 100,000, age -adjusted) 
Nudges and Incentives to Enhance the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_466365]

 and a rate of increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_466387] (19% vs. 16%). North 
Carolina is also one of four states with an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) funded 
Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) MAT learning collaborative available to primary 
care practices,  but eng agement among providers is low. While the main barriers to engagement are 
incompletely understood, recent evidence from provider interviews conducted by [CONTACT_466397] [ADDRESS_598006] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_466388] m a provider’s community into recruitment materials (Aim 1) and 
financial incentives (Aim 2) affect participation in ECHO MAT by [CONTACT_21108]. Through these 
estimates, this study will contribute much -needed information on the incentives that can be used to 
create a behavioral health workforce that is ready to meet the challenges of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].  
2.1 Primary Objective  
Aim 1: To estimate the influence of informational nudges on the engagement of primary care providers 
in an opi[INVESTIGATOR_466379]. Primary care 
providers in North Carolina, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, will be 
randomly assigned to receive either a pro -social recruitment approach for participating in the UNC 
ECHO MAT intervention or standard recruitment practice. Treatment assignment will provide pro -social 
informa tion, including customized figures on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_466380]’s region and the 
Nudges and Incentives to Enhance the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_466365]  
 
[ADDRESS_598007] approach to 
recruitment that does not contain a pro -social recruitmen t message. Analysis of this data will provide 
estimates of the degree of responsiveness of providers to informational nudges.  
Aim 2: To estimate the influence of financial incentives on the participation intensity of primary care 
providers in an opi[INVESTIGATOR_466379]. At the 
second stage, providers agreeing to enroll in the program will be re -randomized to one of three levels of 
reimbursement for time spent participating in the UNC ECHO MAT intervention. Analysis of this data will 
provide causal estimates of the degree of responsiveness of provider participation intensity to financial 
incentives.  
2.[ADDRESS_598008] of incentives on participation intensity varies between the 
pro-social recruitment group and status -quo recruitment group.  
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  (brief overview)  
3.[ADDRESS_598009] in participating in the ECHO 
MAT learning co llaborative (up to 80 of the providers), we will obtain consent to participate in the 
second level of the study, where providers will be randomized to one of three levels of financial 
reimbursement for their time in the ECHO sessions. This is the intervent ion for the second level of  the 
study.  We will monitor the number of sessions attended over 6 months from enrollment  (9 months from 
enrollment for participants who did not complete as of 3/9/2020) . This is the outcome for the second 
level of the study. We will send a letter to inform participants on how  much they have participated and, 
if applicable, their incentive amount.  
 
We may ask up to 44 of the study participants to participate in key informant interviews once their 
participation in the study has end ed (6 months after enrollment). We will also contact a few individuals 
who initially indicated they were interested in participating, but then did not complete the consent 
process. We hope to learn why they did not complete the enrollment process.  
 
We will  contact [CONTACT_466398] 2000 status (this is  
available through the DEA and  publicly available on SAMHSA's website). We will not post or publish 
individual provider specific  information  on Waiver status .

behavior, or their participation i n ECHO MAT learning collaboratives.   
 
Recruitment:  Primary care providers will receive recruitment letters  and may receive emails and 
phone calls based on the recruitment condition they are assigned to.        
Randomization:   
Phase 1: Primary care provide rs will be randomized by [CONTACT_466399] [ADDRESS_598011] an 
equal chance of being randomized to each study arm.        
Phase 2: Eligible participa nts will be randomized to the Phase [ADDRESS_598012] an equal chance of being  randomized to each study arm.   
3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding (if applicable)  
Participants are randomized t o receive [ADDRESS_598013]’s participation will last s ix month s (nine months for subjects who did not complete as of 
3/9/2020  due to the complex practice environment experienced by [CONTACT_466400] -19 pandemi c). 
The entire study is expected to last up to t wo years .  
Total number of subjects will be up to [ADDRESS_598014] 20 subjects in each of the 3 
financial reimbursement groups.

 4 STUDY PR OCEDURES  (what will be done)  
Once a provider is enrolled a schedule of weekly online live UNC ECHO clinic sessions will be sent  from 
the UNC ECHO study team .  Attendance is noted at each session and a summary of the prior months’ 
attendance record is sent  to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_78384] , indicating the number of hours spent in 
training and the reimbursement for those sessions.  The appropriate dollar amount will be paid to the 
participant through a reloadable Visa gift card.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_598015] Completion/ With drawal procedures  
A primary care provider (subject ) can participate in as many or as few ECHO MAT sessions as they like 
during the six -month enrollment in the Nudges study  (nine month  enrollment for participants who do 
not complete as of 3/9/2020) , and can continue to participate in ECHO MAT even after completing the 
Nudges enrollment period. Nudges enrollment is based only on time since initial enrollment. A subject 
may withdraw (or b e withdrawn) from the Nudges study for any reason. The reason for subject 
withdrawal from the study will be recorded.  
 
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS (how measurements will be made)   
See Table [ADDRESS_598016] , limiting to primary care 
providers identified as primary care through their provider type , which gives more than 90% power to 
detect a ten percentage point difference in the binary outcome, response to study recruitment. We will 
use binary models (logit,  linear probability models) to examine response to recruitment as a function of 
study arm, controlling for provider type and county fixed effects.    
For Aim 2, we will randomly recruit at least 60 enrollees (and up to [ADDRESS_598017] 20 providers pe r 
arm of this phase ).   The outcome to be monitored for Aim [ADDRESS_598018] a negative binomial or other 
count data model (depending on statistical tests) of the number of sessions as a function of financial 
incentive arm to estimate the effect of financial incentives on participation.

 7 STUDY INTERVENTION  
See Table 2 in Appendix  
8 STUDY INTERVENTION ADMINISTRATION   
Phase 1 recruitment letters are designed in a 2 (prosocial mention of need for primary care providers 
trained in opi[INVESTIGATOR_466389]. none) x 2 (mention of additional financial  supports available 
for participation in training vs. none). This y ields 4 study  conditions for recruitment letters:  
1) Letter including prosocial messages and additional mention of practice supports available for 
participation,  
2) Letter including prosocial messages but no additional mention of financial  support availa ble for 
participation,  
3) Letter  including an additional mention of financial  support available for participation but no       
prosocial messages, and  
4) Recruitment as usual letter that does not include prosocial messages or an additional mention of 
financial  support available for participation.        
Phase 2 examines participation in the learning community by [CONTACT_19313]. Participants will be  randomly 
assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The investigators are not disclosing the Phase 2 conditions  until  the end of the 
study, as approved by [CONTACT_11604]'s  institutional review board (IRB).  
At the end of data collection, we will send a debriefing form to all participants to share the information 
that we withheld from them at the beginning of the study.  
 
[ADDRESS_598019] information stripped off, but containing identified information on 
providers using a  unique identifier (NPI) allowing linkage to data sources such as Medicaid prescribing 
information . This file will remain with the PI; the other research staff will access only files without patient 
names, addresses and other  direct  identifiers.

providers currently participating in ECHO MAT, available to study investigators, to exclude the providers 
currently participating in ECHO (n=24).  Once the denominator of eligible providers has been determined, 
the ECHO Nudges study te am will randomly select providers in groups of 600 to randomize for pro -social 
or recruitment as usual invitations to participate in ECHO Nudges (and therefore ECHO MAT). From the 
group who decide to participate (outcome for Aim 1), we will re -randomize to  one of the three arms of 
financial incentives. Effort to recruit providers for the Aim 2 analysis will follow immediately from the Aim 
1 retention effort (e.g., providers must agree to participate in ECHO to be randomized to Aim 2). The 
number of sessions  of participation within six months of engagement will be the Aim [ADDRESS_598021] coordinator and/or the study team will give study information in both verbal and written  
form to each potential (provider) participant. Potential research participants are primary care providers 
in NC (MDs, DOs, NP, PAs). No patient identifying information will be collected through this effort. The 
consen t form generated for enrolling PCPs by [CONTACT_466401] (along with the protocol) 
by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB.  Consent will be documented by [CONTACT_466402]’s 
legally authorized representative. The signature [CONTACT_466408].  Each participant’s signed informed consent form will be kept on file by [CONTACT_466403].  
Since it is not possible to consent befo re recruitment  to Aim [ADDRESS_598022].gov #. This is because the aim of the second phase of the study is 
to test the hypothesis that compensating providers for time spent in MAT training increases the time 
they spend training. If we disclose that partici pants are randomly assigned to receive study incentives or 
not, and different amounts. That knowledge alone could lead to differential involvement in the study, 
which would make it impossible to test the hypothesis.

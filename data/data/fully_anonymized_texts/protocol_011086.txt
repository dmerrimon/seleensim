 Page 9 of 57 1.0   Introduction  
 
1.1. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a relatively new brain imaging modality.  Rather 
than imaging parts of the brain that are activated when performing certain tasks, TMS non -
invasively stimulates an area of the brain, and when evoki ng a response, establishes a causal 
relation between brain activation and behavio ur.  
 
TMS when given in form of pulse trains (rTMS) can be used modulate cortical activity by 
[CONTACT_605112] -regulating or down -regulating  cortical excitability  depending on rTMS p arameters 
used. The motor cortices in the left and right hemispheres of human brain are strongly 
interconnected, with each side naturally inhibiting the activity  of the other side – and achieving 
a natural balance. If one side is lesioned as in stroke, how ever, its activation is decreased and 
its inhibition to the other side is reduced, leading to increased activation in the non-lesioned 
side. Additionally, the non-lesioned side still provides inhibitory signals to the lesioned side, 
even more than in the prior healthy balance situation. This mismatch leads to a condition  where 
the lesioned hemisphere  cannot easily deliver action potentials  to the lower motor neuron  and 
the c orresponding muscles. As result, the ability to participate in motor training which is 
necessary for recovery of function  is severely challenged.  
 
Still, there is ample evidence that rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task 
practice (task -oriented therapy) results in long -term functional recovery .  Both animal models 
(Kleim and Jones, 2008) and human clinical trials ( Leipert 2000, Wolf  2006) support a use -
dependent relationship between  task-oriented therapy, neuroplasticity and functi onal 
performance.  Unfortunately, despi[INVESTIGATOR_605017] -oriented therapy 
approaches in clinical rehabilitation, functional  recovery of arm and hand function is limited 
to about 50% of persons with stroke  and full recovery is achieved in l ess than 20% (Kwakkel 
G 2003) .  Adjuvant treatments that enhance response to task -oriented motor training are 
needed.  
 
 A recent discovery is to use repetitive TMS to modulate  regional excitability  of the motor 
cortex  (Hummel and Cohen, 2006). Two potentia l roles have been described for rTMS in stroke 
recovery: (1) inhibit, i.e., down -regulate, the non-lesioned  side (using 1 Hz rTMS), or (2) excite 
the lesioned side (using 10 Hz rTMS). In the present study 1Hz rTMS will be utilized to down -
regulate  the non-lesioned hemisphere  with the goal of improving response to  motor training  
by [CONTACT_605113].  
 
Previously  at least  [ADDRESS_801226] been performed in 2598  
patients with stroke in 2005 -2016  [Boggio PS 2006, Mally J and Dinya E,2008, Dafotakis M

 Page [ADDRESS_801227] on motor function in patients with 
stroke (Hsu, 2012) . This meta -analysis found a significant effect size of 0.55 for motor 
outcome (95% CI, 0.37 –0.72). Further subgroup analyses demonstrated more prominent 
effects for subcortical stroke (mean effect size, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.44 –1.02) and in studies that 
applied  low-frequency (1Hz) rTMS (mean effect size, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.42 –0.95). The meta -
analysis concluded that rTMS has a positive effect on motor recovery in patients with stroke, 
especially for those with subcortical stroke.   
 
However, the studies have not been  designed to demonstrate clinically relevant efficacy and 
only some of them combined rTMS with specific rehabilitation training. Importantly, all 
previous studies have been performed with investigational TMS devices without the aid of 
neuronavigation. Thus , therapy delivery has been performed “blindly” relying on observed 
motor responses. The device operator has not been able to confirm targeting of stimulation to 
a specific neuroanatomic site corresponding to the motor cortex and, importantly, has not been  
able to keep the location of therapy delivery constant during the delivery lasting several 
minutes.  
 
Nexstim has developed a Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) system that uses TMS with a 
software based Navigational System that provide  spatial accuracy  for targeting stimulation to 
specific  areas in motor cortex . The system integrates individual patient’s head MRI pi[INVESTIGATOR_605018]. An integrated E MG allows online detection of MEPs caused by [CONTACT_7712]. 
As an end -result the motor cortical areas commanding a certain muscle or muscle group can 
be targeted and the possible presence of a functioning corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_605019].   
 
The high a ccuracy of the Nexs tim’s NBS has been validated  in studies comparing NBS to 
intraoperative direct electrocortical stimulation (DCS) in patients underg oing neurosurgery .  
The mean di stance  between NBS and DCS has been  6 mm in 81 patients reported  in 6 
publications [Takahashi,  2013] . Nexstim’s NBS technology is FDA approved for pre -
procedural localization of functional motor and language cortex and routinely used by [CONTACT_605114] U.S.  
 
Nexstim’s NBS system overcomes the problems of targeting and repeatability associated with 
non-navigated rTMS in post -CNS injury therapy. In healthy subjects and in patients with 
chronic stroke the effects of 1Hz rTMS were greater when NBS was used to targ et an optimal 
cortical location [ Bashir 2010a and Bashir 2010b ]. Further, in a 30 patient Phase II clinical 
trial, 84% of patients with sub -acute stroke receiving 1Hz contralesional NBS -guided -rTMS 
as adjunct to task -oriented rehabilitation attained clinic ally important improvement of at least  
5 points on the upper extremity Fugl -Meyer scale while in the sham -rTMS group 50% did the 
same [ Harvey 2014 ]. The mean point increase was 13.[ADDRESS_801228] multi -center trial (NICHE trial, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) performed with 
the same NBT trial device  as in the present trial , similar trial protocol and in a patient 
population otherwise identical to that of the present trial protocol, with the exception that 
NICHE trial enrolled patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke while the present trial is

improvement of motor function (>5 points) on UEFM [Harvey, RL et al, manuscript in

between the active NBT -rTMS (67% of all subjects , 72% of subjects with ischemic stroke  
improved at least 5 points on UEFM) and sham -rTMS (65% improved) trial arms. The mean 
improvement on UEFM was 8.[ADDRESS_801229] likely

 Page 12 of 57 1.2. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
 
In the present trial t he Nexstim Navigated Brain Therapy (NBT) System is used for rTMS 
delivery. The NB T system is CE-marked for adjunct therapy for upper extremity rehabilitation 
in patients with stroke in the European Union .  
The Nexstim NBS technology provides navigational accuracy  for the NBT system . NBS 
technology is FDA approved for localization of primary motor cortex [K091457] and language 
function [K112881].  
The Nexstim NBS  Technology  consists of three subsystems. The NBS technology is integrated 
into the TMS software.  
1) TMS Stimulator  
2) NBS Technology  
3) EMG  
 
 
TMS Stimulator : 
The TMS stimulator provides non -invasive stimulation of the central nervous system (CNS).  
The stimulation can be delivered as single pulses, or repetitive TMS (in trains). The stimulator 
provides precise stimulation as the design of the Coil and electroni c components enable focal 
bipulse delivery.  The stimulator is designed to allow the practitioner to have precise control 
of the stimulus location and strength.  It also enables the practitioner to accurately record and 
review which structures have been st imulated, and the level of stimulation delivered.  The 
Nexstim TMS Stimulator will be used in the study to perform the rTMS -therapy in 1Hz rTMS 
mode and the diagnostic evaluations using single -pulse TMS paradigms.  Both paradigms are  
considered to have a n on-significant risk associated with the use of the device  (see section 2.2) .  
 
NBS Technology  
The Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) technology provides navigational accuracy. The 
software uses structural MRI images to control strength and location of TMS s timuli. The 
software presents the predicted reactions of various brain areas when stimulated with TMS 
pulses.   NBS technology is non -invasive and poses no risk to the patients.  
 
EMG Technology  
Surface EMG has been designed for simultaneous use with TMS equipment. Amplifiers are 
protected from the magnetic pulse by a dedicated design. The software allows free transport of 
data between integrated EMG and NBS software.

 Page 13 of 57 2.0   Benefits/risks  
 
2.1. BENEFITS  
 
 
Navigation -guided TMS used in the present study enables accurate targeted delivery of long trains 
of stimulation and modulation of neuronal activity in the brain. The system also makes possible 
the stimulation of the exactly same cortical location on different days. The beneficial effects of 
1Hz rTMS ob served in previous studies are hypothesized to be enhanced by [CONTACT_605115] T system. Combining NB T-rTMS to an established task -
oriented rehabilitation therapy treatment may result in improved functional ou tcomes for the 
patients.  For a summary of previous and supporting investigation, see section 1.0 above.  
 
2.2. RISKS 
 
Single -pulse TMS  
Localization of the muscle representation area which will be subsequently the target location 
for delivering 1Hz rTMS therapy will be performed using the NB T device in a single pul se 
mode. Single pulse TMS has been studied extensively and been established to be safe in 
practically all subjects [Bridgers 1991; Bridgers and Delaney 1989] .  It was judged by a panel 
of experts with FDA representation at an NIH Consensus Conference in June 1996 to be a non-
signifi cant risk application [Hallett et al. 1999; Wassermann 1996].  No serious adverse 
events related to single -pulse stimulation have been reported to Nexstim by [CONTACT_605116].  
 
1Hz rTMS  
In the report of the NIH Consensus Conference cited above [Wassermann 1996] rTMS was 
recognized to be associated with potentially more frequent (although still rare) adverse effects 
than single -pulse TMS. The frequency of adverse effects was noted to increase in parallel with 
the frequency (Hz) and intensity (% of motor threshold) of the rTMS trains used. The workshop 
issued safety guidelines where for 1Hz rTMS trains of >1800 pulses given at 100 or 110% of 
motor threshold were considered safe . These guidelines have been reassessed  and updated with 
no change to the evaluation of safety of the 1Hz rTMS paradigm  [Rossi 2009] . In the present 
study 1 Hz trains of 900 pulses at 110% of motor threshold  targeting the healthy brain 
hemisphere  will be utilized  in patients at least [ADDRESS_801230] been reported in 
the 27 studies in 2598  patients  with stroke in 2005 -2016  (Boggio [ADDRESS_801231] EM 2008, Kirton A   2008, Liepert J   2007, 
Mansur CG  2005,  Nowak DA  2008, Takeuchi N  2005, Takeuchi N  2008(a), Takeuchi N  
2008(b), Khedr EM 2009, Emara T, 2010, Kakuda W 2011 (a), Kaku da W 2011 (b), Thielig S 
2011, Kakuda W 2011 (c) , Kakuda W 2012, Sung W 2013, Abo M 2013 , Higgins 2013, Kim, 
2014. Rose 2014 Cha H 2015, Zheng C 2015,  Kakuda W 2016).  
 
Further, no serious adverse events have occurred in the studies where NBS -guided rTMS has been 
used (a total of 3813  rTMS sessions in 224 patients with stroke)  [Bashir S 2010 (b), Harvey RL , 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 14 of 57 2013 , Harvey RL, manuscript in preparation ].This includes the use experience in the NICHE 
multicentre trial in which no device related SAE occurred in the [ADDRESS_801232] (DSMB) monitoring the NICHE trial identified no 
safety related concerns during the trial.  
 
Based on the fact that the rTMS train used in the present clinical trial falls comfortably and with a 
wide margin (50%) within the consensus safety guidelines and the lack of side -effects in the 
relatively extensive literature specific to the study population in the present trial the rTMS 
paradigm of the present study can be considered a non -significant risk application.  
 
Potential adverse effe cts 
There are, however, potential risks of seizures, hearing loss, immunological and 
neuropathological changes, as described below.  
 
Microvascular Changes  
Studies of prolonged exposure to TMS were performed in animal models.  Microvascular 
changes in the c ortex were found in rats exposed to over 100 pulses at 2.8 Tesla, but these 
findings were not evident in  rabbits exposed to 100 - 200 pulses per day at 2.4 Tesla over 30 -
42 days [Nishikiori 1996] , nor were they seen in  rabbits exposed to 1000 pulses at 2.0 Tesla 
over a period of months [Counter 1993] .  Furthermo re, rats exposed to 50 -60 1.9 - Tesla pulses 
delivered over 15 minutes had no significant changes in blood -brain barrier permeability 
[Ravnborg et al. 1990] . 
 
Seizure Activity  
Seizure activity is a theoretical risk of TMS.  Althou gh, single pulse TMS has not caused 
seizure activity in healthy volunteers, seizures have been produced by [CONTACT_25505] -pulse TMS in 
several patients with large cerebral infarcts or other structural lesions [Fauth et al. 1992; 
Homberg and Netz 1989; Kandler 1990] .  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_605020] a minor degree of risk from single pulse TMS.   For example, in a se ries of studies by 
[CONTACT_605117], single -pulse TMS was occasionally able to induce seizures or 
activate epi[INVESTIGATOR_605021] (EEG) foci [Hufnagel et al. 1990a; Hufnagel et al. 
1990b; Hufnagel et al. 1990c] .  In this study slow frequency trains of stimulation were used. 
In the current study we propose to use single pulse stimuli with a variable interstimulus 
interval. However, these results may not apply in patients in whom epi[INVESTIGATOR_605022]. To wit, Tassinari et al [Tassinari et al. 1990]  found that TMS did not incite seizure 
activity in a cohort of  patie nts receiving  anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_132392]. Subjects with a personal 
history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_605023].  
 
rTMS has been reported to cause seizures in at least [ADDRESS_801233] been utilized [Wassermann 19 96].  
 
In the clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of rTMS paradigms similar to the one 
used by [CONTACT_605118], no seizures have been reported in the 27 studies 
in 2598 patients with stroke in 2005 -2016 (Boggio [ADDRESS_801234] EM 2008, Kirton A   2008, Liepert J   2007, Mansur CG  2005,

Cha H 2015, Zheng C 2015,  Kakuda W 2016).  
Further, no seizures ha ve occurred in the studies where NBS -guided rTMS has been used (a total 
of 365 rTMS sessions in 25 patients with stroke) [Bashir S 2010 (b), Harvey RL , 2013 , Harvey , 
RL, manuscript in preparation ]. Similarly, no seizures occurred in the NICHE multicentre trial in 
the 3448 therapy sessions performed in 199 patients using the same trial device and protocol as the 
present trial.  
 
 
Auditory Changes  
During TMS there is a loud clicking sound from the coil (up to 120 -130dB).  Single -pulse TMS 
induces permanent increases of the auditory threshold [Counter et al. 1990]   in animals and 
transient increases in humans [Pascual -Leone et al. 1992], but these changes can be prevented 
with the use o f foam earplugs [Pascual -Leone et al. 1993].  
 
Immunological Changes  
Single -pulse stimulation may induce changes in T lymphocyte subset [Wassermann 2000].  In 
general, these changes have been short -lived (<48 hours) and comparable to changes seen with 
stress, menstruation or circadian cycles [Wassermann 2000].  
 
Psychiatric changes  
Treatment -emergent mania has been reported for low and high frequency rTMS in patients  
with uni - and bipolar depression [ Xia 2008, Rossi 2009]  after stimulation of the left prefrontal 
cortex.  Mania has not been reported in any patients or subjects in whom motor cortex has been 
stimulated as in the present study.  
 
Neurocognitive Changes  
A number of studies have examined the effect of TMS on cogni tive function.  In general, both 
transient and short -term studies of TMS have failed to demonstrate consistent effects on 
cognitive function following TMS [Pascual -Leone et al. 1993; Little et al 2000; Wassermann 
et al. 1996]. TMS can produce desired and u ndesired, usually within the frame of the  
experimental design but potentially long lasting, changes. Such effects, which generally follow 
a single application of rTMS, can be produced by [CONTACT_605119] (Harris 2008), are sm all and, are considered  not to raise particular safety issues by 
[CONTACT_605120] (for review see Rossi et al., 2007c and 
Rossi 2009).   
 
EMG  
There may be a small amount of irritation of the skin from the electrode paste (less than 5% 
chance). There is no known risk involved in recording EMG activity from these sensors and 
electrodes.  
 
Headaches  
Another risk that has been cited is a higher frequency of experiencing mild headaches, which 
resolve soon after the procedure.  I t is speculated that the headaches may be a result of 
maintaining a fixed position  of the head and neck  for the duration of the procedure.

Primary outcome measure: Upper -extremity Fugl -Meyer score.  
The benefici al effect of 1Hz NBS guided rTMS will be established if a statistically 
signicantly greater proportion of patients receiving NBS -rTMS attain clinically important 
improvement  in the primary outcome measure than patients receiving sham -rTMS 
between baseline  and [ADDRESS_801236] -treatment.  
 
 
 
3.2      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
 
Secondary outcome measures for the study are:  
Absolute change in points on UEFM  
Action -Research Arm Test (ARAT)  
NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS)  
 
The changes on these scales between baseline and [ADDRESS_801237]-treatment will be determined 
for both therapy groups and the groups compared to each other  to establish effects of therapy .   
Quality of life  outcomes:  
In addition to the other secondary outcome measures above the patients’ quality of life will be 
assessed using the EQ-5D questionnaire.  The change  on this scale  between baseline and [ADDRESS_801238] -treatment will be determined for both therapy groups and the groups compared to 
each other to establish effects of therapy on quality of life.  
 
Assess ment of  safety : 
To assess safety of study device use,  all Serious Adverse Events , Unanticipated Adverse 
Device Events and Device Related Adverse Events will be recorded and compared between 
therapy groups..

approved informed consent document prior to participation.  Failure to provide informed 
consent renders the subject ineligible for the study.  
 
 
5.0   study procedure s 
 
5.1 BLINDING AND SHAM -CONDITION .  
 
5.1.1. Blinding  
Blinding is achieved as follows:  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 20 of 57 Study staff: only the person responsible for randomization and the person (s) administering 
rTMS at the study site(s) will be aware of whether the patient is receiving NBS -rTMS or sham -
rTMS. Neither of these persons is all owed to discuss randomization with the patient or study 
staff. Neither of these persons will direct or perform task -oriented rehabilitation with the 
patient nor will they perf orm any outcome measure testing thus ensuring that these tasks are 
not influenced  by [CONTACT_605122].  
  
All other members of the  study staff will be unaware of randomization. The reason for the 
person administering rTMS is unblinded is that since a supra -motor threshold protocol of rTMS 
is delivered to the patients healthy m otor cortex, this will cause muscle activation and visible 
muscle movement in the patients hand which the person administering rTMS can not avoid to 
observe. Since sham rTMS condition by [CONTACT_605123] g the rTMS would become unblinded by [CONTACT_605124].  
 
Patients:  
Each individual patient will be blinded to randomization by [CONTACT_49392] (s)he has no prior 
experience of rTMS and therefore can’t assess whether an active or sham cond ition rTMS 
(through the use of sham coil for rTMS) has been used in her treatment. Further, of the staff 
that the patient meets only the person administering rTMS will be aware of the randomization. 
Since that person will be explicitly forbidden to discuss  that issue, the patient will be unable to 
obtain information on randomization.  The effectiveness of the blinding will be assessed at the 
end of the study asking the patient what group they thought they were in.  
 
5.1.2 Sham condition:  
Sham condition will b e delivered by [CONTACT_605125] T system to navigate and localize a sham 
TMS coil to the same position on the patients head as the active TMS coil would be located if 
active NB T-rTMS would be delivered. The sham coil will cause an auditory sensation and a 
mecha nical  scalp sensation similar to the active TMS coil  but will not induce an intracranial 
electric field  capable inducing neuromodulation . The s ham coil will be used to deliver an rTMS 
train of equal frequency and length as the active coil (900 pulses at 1H z). 
 
  
The study will consist of 24 study visits  with the possible addition of 5 additional visits as 
needed to complete outcome assessments.   
 
 
5.2. VISIT SCHEDULE  
 
The study will be performed over 24 to 29 sessions:  
1) Visit 1(Screening visit): Baseline = 3-12 months after the stroke. The purpose of this 
visit is to obtain informed consent for the study (if not previously obtained) and to 
screen subjects for inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
2) Visit 2: Baseline assessment . The purpose of this visit is to es tablish the baseline of 
injury, motor status and NBS parameters  (Localization of cortical motor representation 
area of the target muscle to which therapeutic rTMS will be subsequently delivered , 
see appendix A).  Subjects will also undergo a structural MRI .   The subject will then 
be randomized to either rTMS or to sham treatment.  The baseline visit may if necessary 
take place on 2 separate days.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 21 of 57 3) Visits 3-20: During these visits the patient will undergo standardized task -oriented 
motor rehabilitation of the  hand. In addition the patient will receive the rTMS therapy 
according to the protocol of the group she/he was randomized into during visit 1. The 
visits will take place during a [ADDRESS_801241] on consecutive days.  
4) Visit 2 1: End of the task -oriented motor rehabilitation. The purpose of the visit is to 
establish the extent of recovery that has occurred during the rehabilitati on. The visit 
will take place 5-[ADDRESS_801242] rTMS/rehabilitation session and includes 
functional motor testing ).1-2 visits may be needed to complete assessment.   
5) Visit 2 2: 1month (+5 days) after the end of the rehabilitation therapy. The purpose of 
the visit is to determine whether any changes in motor function have occurred within 1 
month of ending therapy. The assessment includes functional motor testing .  1-2 visits 
may be needed to complete assessment.   
6) Visit 23 : 3 months  (+5 days)  after end o f the rehabilitation therapy.  The purpose of 
this visit is to determine whether any changes in motor function or NBS parameters 
have occurred within 3 month of ending therapy. The assessment includes functional 
motor testing . In patients experienc ing a new stroke, only the data prior to the event  
will be used in the analysis.   1-2 visits may be needed to complete assessment.   
7) Visit 24:  6 months  (+5 days)  after end of the rehabilitation therapy. The purpose of 
this visit is to determine the long -term reha bilitation success. The assessment includes 
functional motor testing . In patients experienc ing a new stroke, only the data prior to 
the event  will be used in the analysis. 1 -2 visits may be needed to complete assessment.  
 
5.2.1  Screening and informed consent  
 
Eligibility will be confirmed through a series of steps as follows (see inclusion/exclusion 
criteria for details).   
 Medical history and medications.  
 The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) assessed by [CONTACT_605126].  
 The Modified mini mental exam (MMSE) [Teng and Chui 1987] is a series of questions 
(approximately 5 minutes) to assess orientation (e.g. date, place) and ability to follow 
commands.    
 Spasticity will be measured using the Modified Ash worth Spasticity (MAS) Scale  
[Bohannon and Smith 1987]. The MAS is a 6 -point ordinal rating scale for measuring 
muscle tone, with ratings from 0 (no increase in tone) to 4 (limb rigid in flexion or 
extension).   
 The National Institutes of Health Stroke Sc ale (NIHSS)  is a measure of neurological 
functioning, with higher scores reflectin g greater deficit (maximum 42).  
 Chedoke -McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) [Gowland et al. 2003] includes an 
impairment inventory and an activity inventory.   The Impairment i nventory includes 
staging assessments of shoulder pain, postural control, recovery of arm and hand, and 
recovery of leg and foot.  Only arm and hand impairment will be assessed which stages 
each between 1 and 7 with higher score indicating better motor per formance  
 The possible presence and severity of depression will be assessed using the Patient 
Health Questionnaire (P HQ9) [Graves & Bobardier 2008].  The P HQ9 has nine 
inquiries about the frequency of symptoms associated with depressed mood over the 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 22 of 57 previous 2 weeks, each scored between 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).  The 
maximum score is 27 points.  Scores that equal 10 or greater are associated with 
clinical depression.  The P HQ9 has been tested and validated in stroke populations 
with good  sensitivity for detecting depression [de Man -van Ginkel, et al. 2012; 
Janneke, et al. 2012].  
 
Structural MRI  
Unless already existing, a n MRI will be acquired using a high resolution  (1.5T or more)  T1 
weighted image of the subject’s brain on any standard magnetic resonance system. MRI 
acquisition parameters and instructions are shown in the NBT System User manual.  
 
The subject’s structural MRI sliced images will be loaded into the Nexstim NBT system .  
 
5.2.2 Baseline assessment  
 
The following functional tests will be administered by [CONTACT_605127] . Training and 
certification of the researchers to perform these tests is described in a separate Outcome 
Assessment Training and Certification Plan  
   
 The Fugl Meyer (FM)  will measure functional movement. The FM offers impressive 
test-retest reliability (total=.98 -.99; subtests=.87 -1.00), and construct validity [Duncan 
et al. 1983; DiFabio and Badke 1990]. The upper extremity (UE) FM movement scale 
is a measure of upper li mb function, with higher scores reflecting greater function.  
 
 The Action Research Arm  Test (ARAT) [Lyle 1981]  is used to determine whether fine 
motor skill changes occurred in the affected hand and fingers . The ARAT is a [ADDRESS_801243] divided into four cat egories (grasp, grip, pi[INVESTIGATOR_820], and gross movement), with each 
item graded on a 4 -point ordinal scale (0=can perform no part of the test; 1=performs 
test partially; 2=completes test but takes abnormally long time or has great difficulty; 
3=performs test norma lly) for a total possible score of 57. The test is hierarchical in 
that, if the patient is able to perform the most difficult skill in each category, he/she 
will be able to perform the other items within the category and, thus, they need not be 
tested. The  ARAT has high intrarater ( r = .99) and retest ( r = .98) reliability and validit y  
[Lyle 1981; Van der Lee et al. 2001]  
 
 The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale  (NIHSS) will be repeated at baseline 
visit.  
 
 
 EQ-5D 
The EQ -5D questionnaire is a standardized, well validated instrument for 
assessing patients ’ health and quality of life. The questionnaire will be utilized to 
establish the overall impact of stroke on the patients ’ quality of life and used to assess 
possible changes during the trial p eriod.

5.2.3 Randomization  
 
 
Randomization will occur using a random number generator programmed to randomize 
patients to rTMS vs Sham TMS in a 1:1 ratio such that approximately  30 patients will be 
randomized to treatment and 30 patient s randomized to sham . Randomization will be done 
separately for each participating site so that the 1:[ADDRESS_801244] suffered stroke 
more than 6 months (maximum 1 2 months) earlier.  
 
The groups differ only as to the rTMS protocol they receive during the study. The groups are 
: sham rTMS  (900 pulses at 1Hz frequency) , and active NBS -rTMS (900 pulses at 110% of 
motor threshold , 1Hz frequency ).

3. [ADDRESS_801246]  
 
4. 1Hz navigation guided rTMS  (For detailed description see appendix A) 
For patients randomized to receive rTMS , the stimulation will be delivered in  a single 
pulse train 900 pulses given at 110% of motor threshold . The motor threshold will be 
determined at each visit. The train will be targeted on the motor representation of the 
m.EDC on the healthy brain hemisphere determined at the basel ine visit (NOTE: the 
rTMS delivery location will thus be the same at each visit). 
 
OR 
 
Sham rTMS  
For patients randomized to receive Sham rTMS , the sham stimulation will be delivered  
in a single 1Hz pulse train of 900 pulses given using a Sham coil. The train will be 
targeted on the motor representation of the m.EDC on the healthy brain hemisphere 
determined at the baseline visit (NOTE: the rTMS delivery location will thus be the 
same at each visit).

5.2.6 Occupational therapy, physiotherapy and home exercise program during the 
active treatment and follow -up periods of the trial 
 
Occupational therapy:  
During the 6 weeks active treatment period of the trial (visits 3-20) the patients are not allowed 
any other occupational therapy except that provide in the trial. After the active 
treatment period during the 6 month follow -up period of the trial, patients are allowed 
occupational therapy. The hours of therapy will be documented. Patients will be 
queried once every 2 weeks until the final outcome assessment visit at 6 months after 
end of active trial treatment, either when they visit the study site or they will be called 
and queried . 
Physical therapy:  
Patients are  allow ed participation in physical therapy for the full trial duration including during 
the active treatment period of the trial (visits 3 -20). However, the hours of therapy 
and time of  use of t he affected upper extremity in  treatment sessions will be 
documented . Patients will be queried once every 2 weeks until the final outcome 
assessment visit at 6 months after end of active trial treatment, either when they visit 
the study site or they will be called and queried.  
Home exercise program:  
During the 6 weeks active treatment period of the trial (visits 3 -20) the patients are not allowed

Primary outcome measure for the trial is the Upper -extremity F ugl-Meyer score.  
The beneficial effect of 1Hz NBS guided rTMS will be established if a statistically signi ficantly 
greater proportion of patients receiving NBS -rTMS attain clinically important improvement

6.1 POWER ANALYSIS  AND BORROWING DATA FROM  NICHE -TRIAL  ACTIVE TRIAL ARM RES ULTS  
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 26 of 57 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 30 patients of whom 20 were randomized to active NBS -rTMS and 10 to 
sham -rTMS, 8 4% of the active NBS -rTMS group and 50% of th e sham rTMS group attained 
clinically significant improvement of at least 5 points on the Fugl -Meyer score [Harvey RL 
2009, Harvey RL, unpublished].  
Similarly, in the completed multi -centre trial (NICHE -trial, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) of 199 subjects 
using the same trial device but different sham coil design, 72% of subjects with ischemic stroke 
receiving active NBT -rTMS attained clinically significant improvement of at least 5 points on 
the Fugl -Meyer score [Harvey RL, manuscript in preparation] while the average expectation 
of NICHE trial site principal investigators of subjects improving was 36%.   
 
Based on this data and sample size calculations utilizing significance level of 0.05 for p, we 
estimate that enrolling  60 patients need  to be recruited to the present study to rule out the null 
hypothesis that there is no difference between active NB T-rTMS and sham -rTMS with 81% 
power. This assumption is based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_605029] 33% difference in responder rate 
between groups i n favour of the NBS -rTMS group  and 36% difference in the actual vs expected 
responder rate in patients with ischemic stroke in NICHE . However, since the active treatment 
arm of the present trial and the active trial arm of NICHE are treated in a completely  identical 
manner (the same NBT device, same active rTMS protocol, the same standardized 
occupational therapy protocol as in NICHE, the same number of therapy sessions in the same 
schedule at the same trial sites, etc) this allows pooling of the data obtai ned in the NICHE 
active trial arm to the data obtained in the active trial arm in the present trial. As in NICHE 
there were 88 subjects with ischemic stroke receiving active NBT -rTMS. Combining their data 
with that of the present trial will lead into a tri al population of approximately 118 subjects 
receiving active treatment (88 from NICHE + 30 from the present trial) and approximately 30 
subjects receiving sham treatment (all from the present trial). The study power in this 
population is sufficient to rule  out the null hypothesis with 96% power.  
 
The statistical analysis of the present trial will be performed in two phases.  The Bayesian 
analysis of the E -FIT data combined with  data borrow ed from the active trial arm of the 
previously completed NICHE trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  will be the primary efficacy analysis. 
Non-Bayesian analysis of the E -FIT trial data only will be performed to demonstrate 
robustness of the result. Detailed methodology for the analyses is described in a separate 
statistical analysis plan (Document NX103 [ADDRESS_801253] 2018 ).

6.3 ANALYSIS  POPULATIONS  
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
 
The ITT population will consist of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT population 
will be summarized and analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized, 
regardless of the treatment they actually received.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 27 of 57  
Per Protocol (PP) Population  
 
The PP population will consist of all subjects who were randomized, received study 
treatment, and had no major protocol vio lations.  
 
If a subject suffers a new stroke during the trial and the new stroke affects the motor function 
of the limb being treate d in the study, only the outcome assessment data collected prior to 
the new stroke will be used for PP Popu lation analysis. The sponsor will review the new 
strokes and determine if it affects the motor function of the limb.  
 
Safety Population  
 
The Safety population will consist of all subjects who received study treatment. Subjects in 
the safety population will be summarized and analyzed according to the treatment they 
actually received, regardless of whether or not they were randomized to receive that 
treatment.  
 
6.4   STRATA AND COVARIATES  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_605129] (3 -6 months 
vs. 6 -12 months).  
 
Additional covariate analyses will model the primary endpoint (a binary response of UEFM 
score improvement ) , absolute changes (in points) in the tests of motor function (UEFM,  
and ARAT ) using hours of occupational therapy outside the trial and overall hours of 
therapy (occupational, physical, and home exercise ) as covariates  during treatment phase 
and over the entire 6 months of follow -up.  
 
All covariate analysis will be performed for both ITT and PP population.  
 
 
6.5  SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL  
 
Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analyses will be conducted with a significance level 
(α) of 0.[ADDRESS_801255] has potential to be used for labelling purposes, a Bonferroni adjustment 
will be employed. A significance level (α) of 0.025 will be used for th is secondary analysi s 
only. All other secondary analyses will use α = 0.05 as they are not to be used for any 
labeling purpose.  
 
 
6.6 DATA  HANDLING  METHODS  
 
6.6.1 Missing Data  
[IP_ADDRESS] Date Values  
In cases of incomplete dates (e.g., AE, concomitant medication, medical history start and/or 
stop dates), the missing component(s)  will be assumed as the most conservative value(s) 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_801256] day of the month 
will be imputed for study day computations (i.e., treatment -emergent status, etc.) unless it 
is the same month and year (only day missing) or year (day and month missing) as the start 
date of treatment. In this case, start date of treatment will be used, which assumes treatment 
emergence.  If day is missing for an end date, the last day of the month will be imputed .  A 
similar imputation will be used for missing month dates.  
Date imputation will only be used for computational purposes e.g., treatment -emergent 
status, etc.  Actual data values as they appear in the original CRFs will be shown in the data 
listings.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Date Values  
Every effort will be made to obtain the protocol -required data for all study assessments that 
are scheduled for each visit for all enrolled subjects.  Missing values for the primary 
endpoint of Fugl -Meyer scores for post -baseline visi ts will be imputed using Last 
Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) for ITT analyses. Subjects with a six -month Fugl -
Meyer score but no baseline score will have their six -month Fugl -Meyer score imputed 
backwards to serve as their missing baseline Fugl -Meyer s core.  Subjects with no baseline 
or six -month Fugl -Meyer score will have the mean baseline Fugl -Meyer score for their 
treatment arm imputed for both their baseline and six -month score.  
These same imputation methods will be used for secondary endpoints as w ell. 
 
6.7 SAFETY  ANALYSES  
 
The Safety Population will be used for all analysis, summaries, and listings of safety data.  
 
Adverse Events  
 
All reported terms (investigator descriptions) for AEs will be coded using the most recent 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA v16.0) and summarized 
with frequencies and percentages by [CONTACT_1570], system organ classific ation, and 
preferred term.   
Note that subjects experiencing AEs are counted at most one time per preferred term and at 
most one time per system organ class, at the highest recorded severity and causality. Events 
without recorded relationship or causality are summarized as severe or definitely related.  
The number and percentage of subjects in the following categories will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_229380]: subjects with AE, TEAE, SAE, TESAE, UADE, DRAE, TEAE resulting in 
study discontinuation, and deaths.  
 
The following tables will also be presented:  
- All TEAEs  
- SAEs and TESAEs

A UADE is defined as any AE that is definitely related to the study device. All UADEs will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_39960]. A listing of UADEs will also be 
provided.  
 
Device -Related Adverse Events (DRAE)  
 
A DRAE is defined as any AE that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study 
device. All DRAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_39960]. A listing 
of DRAEs will also be provided.  
 
6.7.[ADDRESS_801257] blinding Success  
 
The patients will be asked at the end of the baseline visit (Visit 2), at the end of the first 
treatment visit (Visit 3), at the end of the last treatment visit (Visit 20 and at the 6 month follow -
up visit (Visit 24) whether they think they were in the active group or in the sham group. The 
data will be summarized with frequency and percentage by [CONTACT_147246]. Chi -
square test will be used for this assessment of subject blinding success.  
 
Outcome Assessmen t Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605030] -up visit (Visit 21) and at the 6 
month outcome assessment visit (Visit 24) whether they think the subject was in the active 
rTMS group or in the sham rTMS group or they didn’t know. The data will summarized with 
frequency and percentage by [CONTACT_605130]. Chi -square test will used for 
assessment of outcome assessment therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605031].  
 
In addition, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605032] f revealed group randomization and if 
the subject told them what group they believed they were in. The data will be summarized for 
those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605033]’t know which group the subject was in and those who think the 
subject was in either the active or sh am rTMS group separately. The data will used for 
background information to explain the results of assessment of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605031].  
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 30 of 57 7.0  Monitoring and quality assurance    
 
INDEPENDENT MONITORIN G OF SOURCE DATA  AND SAFETY  
 
The data will be col lected by [CONTACT_114377] (PI, co -investigators and study staff) familiar with 
the protocol and the TMS technology.  The care, safety, and comfort of the subjects will be 
under the supervision of a physician and  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605034]) . 
 
 
Clinical monitoring  
The study sponsor  will be responsible for Clinical Monitoring of the study. The Clinical 
Monitor's responsibilities include maintaining regular contact [CONTACT_605131] -site visits, to ensure that:  
 
- the trial is conducted according to protocol ; 
- the Investigational Plan is followed;  
- study staff is trained and capable of performing the tasks required from them in a uniform 
manner at each trial site .  The central site (R ehabilitation Institute of Chicago ) will provide 
training for all assessors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  At the beginning of the study and every 6 months 
during the study all assessors will be trained, certified and/or re -certified for their role .  
Additional training will be provided to study staff w ho do not pass the review. Staff members 
will only be permitted to perform study duties if they have successfully passed their most recent 
evaluation.   
- complete, timely, and accurate data are recorded and submitted;  
- problems with inconsistent or incomp lete data are addressed;  
- complications and unanticipated adverse effects are reported to the IRB and Sponsor;  
- the site facilities continue to be adequate to meet the requirements of the study.  
 
The Clinical Monitor will initiate the Study during an on -site visit and will continue to perform 
on-site monitoring visits as frequently as deemed necessary.  The first monitoring visit will 
usually be made as soon as possible after enrollment has been initiated.  At this visit and all 
monitoring visits, the Cli nical Monitor will compare the data entered onto the CRF's with the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source documentation).  At a minimum, source documentation must 
be available to substantiate proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol 
procedure s, adequate reporting and follow -up of AEs.  Findings from the review of CRFs and 
source documents during a monitoring visit will be discussed with the PI.  Completed pages of 
the CRFs will be collected for evaluation at each visit.  The dates of the monit oring visit will 
be recorded in a Log to be kept at the clinical site.  During monitoring visits, the Sponsor  
expects that the study coordinator and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_5915] (as needed), the source 
documentation will be available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of 
Study related documents.  
 
 
Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
The study will be performed under the supervision of an Independent Data Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) that will consist of clinician who  are not I nvestigator(s) in the study, and one 
independent statistician.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 31 of 57 Details of the DSMB composition and operational activities will be described in detail in a 
separate DSMB charter.  
Briefly, the DSMB responsibilities are to:  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including assessments of data quality and timeliness, 
participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance 
of trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  
• consi der factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as 
scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the 
participants or the ethics of the trial;  
• protect the safety of the study participa nts;  
• report on the safety and progress of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the Sponsor , the PI, and, if required, to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) concerning continuation, 
termination or other modif ications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse 
effects of the treatment under study;  
•  
• ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring; and,  
• assist Sponsor by [CONTACT_57018], enrollment, and sample 
size and/or data collection.   
 
All subjects will be monitored by a member of study staff during the study visits.  All cases 
performed during a calendar month will be reviewed at the end of that month to monitor for 
any poten tial adverse effects from the subjects’ participation in the study.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTI NG GUIDELINE  
 
Serious  adverse events will be reported to the IRB and the sponsor verbally within 24 hours, 
followed by a full written report within 10 working days.  All other adverse events will be 
summarized in the progress report at Continuing Review  by [CONTACT_605132] .  All 
adverse events will be assessed for their relationship to the study device or procedure  by 
[CONTACT_32622] . 
   
Throughout the study, adverse eve nts and concomitant medications will be monitored and 
recorded.  All Serious Adverse Events will be captured and assessed.  All Serious Adverse 
Events will be reported as event and patient based count.  
 
 
ADVERSE EVENT  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirab le clinical experience (any sign, symptom, illness, 
abnormal laboratory value or other medical event) that occurs in a subject (or an event that 
worsens during the course of the study) and that could possibly be associated with the 
investigational product,  procedure or medications required by [CONTACT_3181].  An adverse event 
may result from a device failure if an undesirable clinical event occurs.  In this study, subjects 
should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page [ADDRESS_801258] decide whether an adverse event meets the definition of a 
“serious” adverse event.  The regulatory definition o f a serious adverse event (SAE) is an event 
that is fatal or life -threatening, results in persistent or significant disability, requires 
intervention to prevent permanent impairment, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or resu lts in congenital anomaly or malignancy.   
 
Any serious adverse event or subject death occurring during the study follow -up period must 
be reported within one working day after the investigator learns of the event.  
 
 
 
Device Failure, Malfunctions and Near Incidents  
Investigators are instructed to report all possible device failures, malfunctions or near incidents 
observed during the course of the trial.  These incidents will be documented in the case report 
form provided as follows:  
 
 Device Failure:   A dev ice failure has occurred when the device is used in compliance 
with the study protocol , but does not perform as described in device manual  and also 
negatively impacts treatment of the study subject.  
 
 Device Malfunction:   A device malfunction occurs when an unexpected change to the 
device that is contradictory to the device manual  is observed, which may or may not 
affect device performance.  
 
Device Misuse:  Any use of the investigational device by [CONTACT_605133].

MRI  TO HEAD CO-REGISTRATION  
Using the nasion  and the crus of hel ix of the ear s, landmarks that are visible on both the 
subject’s MRI and the head, the 3D -locations of landmark are measured using a digitizing pen 
with an optical tracking system. This registration will allow real time monitoring of the coil 
position wit hout restraining the subjects head during the TMS experiment.  The optical tracking 
system uses a camera to measure the 3D -location of infrared reflectors attached to the coil and 
subject’s head.

Identifying the rough location of hand motor area  
This identification of the rough location of hand motor area  is used in determination of the 
initial motor threshold and as  a referenc e for the actual motor  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
1) Identify the hand knob at pri mary motor cortex, if possible.  
a) Peel the 3D head to a depth where the gyral patterns of neuroanatomy are clearly visible 
(approximately 20 -25 mm ) 
b) For reference utilized during mappi[INVESTIGATOR_605043] a stimulation target on the motor cortex. 
The position of the marker is on the medial end of the so called “motor knob” on the 
central sulcus.  
2) Set initial stimulation intensity  
a) Adjust stimulator output so that the software displays stimulation intensity between 80 
and 100 V/m (at 25 mm peeling depth).  
b) Give a preparing stimulus pulse on the marker and check the response of the target 
muscle m.EDC  
c) Give two stimuli are on the target and check m.EDC response latencies (normal 15 -
25ms) and amplitudes .  
i) IF YOU GET EMG RESPONSE >500uV : Lower the stimulation intensity 1 – 2 
% of stimulator output and repeat stimulation until the m.EDC peak -to-peak 
response is in the range of 100 -500uV.  
ii) IF YOU GET EMG RESPONSE <100uV : Increase the intensity of stimulus u ntil 
the m.EDC amplitude is 100 -500uV.  
3) Using the intensity defined in the previous step, continue stimulation by [CONTACT_605137]. Stimulation is ended when there 
is no response. This is most likely to happen about 2 cm from the marker. NOTE:  Make 
sure that you stimulate also directly over the precentral gyrus. Return to the marker and 
continue stimulation by [CONTACT_605138]. Expand the stimulated 
area until MEP’s disappear.  
4) Select the largest m.EDC response and set is as Repeat S timulus.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 40 of 57 5) Testing coil  orientations:  
a) The first stimulus is given on the repeat stimulus target. This is the zero degree position.  
Check the EMG response amplitude which is now the reference. Turn off location 
controlled stimulation. Using the aiming tool to repeat stimulus on the marker, the 
stimulation on the marker is continued so that after each stimulus the coil is turned 20 
degrees left. The m.EDC response amplitude (µV) is checked  after each given stimulus. 
The stimulation is terminated when the response is less than  100µ V. 
b) Return to the original orientation on the marker and continue stimulation on the marker 
so that after every stimulus the coil is turned 20 degrees right.  After every stimulus the 
response amplitude  (µV) is checked.  Stimulation is terminated when t he response is 
less than 100µV.   
c) The coil orientation giving the best motor response is selected for defining the motor 
threshold.  
Initial motor threshold measurement  for defining intensity for motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] :  
The motor threshold (MT) is defined as the lowest stimulation intensity producing a response 
in the target muscle (m.Extensor Digitorum Communis, m.EDC) at least in 50% of trials. The 
presumption is that the motor threshold varies due to the functional state of the brain which 
may be altered by [CONTACT_605139].  
 
1) Start the MT determination tool from the stimulus defined in the previous step.  
2) Stimulate guided by [CONTACT_605140], leaving 
3-5 seconds between each stimulus .  
3) In the end of the iteration, the software displays the patient’s motor threshold value as a 
percentage of the maximum stimulator output.  
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_605044] m.EDC hotspot  
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_605045]  a 
stimul ator intensity that generates ~ 100 -300µV MEPs repeatably at the location where 
resting motor threshold is determined. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_533610]  110%  of the resting motor 
threshold.  
 
The overall goal is to find a stimulation location, on or near the motor strip, t hat elicits 
the largest amplitude EDC MEP during mappi[INVESTIGATOR_605046].   
 
1) Set the stimulator output to 110% of the motor threshold defined previously  
2) Once the stimulation intensit y is determined, the rMT determining location should be set 
as the active stimulation t arget to overlay a stimulation G rid on cortex.

stimuli while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_605047]. Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_605048] 3 stimuli per  grid location, deli vered with 3 -4s between pulses, until 
stimulation at locations around the “rim” or outer edge of the map do not produce 
reproducible MEPs  (=at least 2/3 stimuli to location do not elicit a MEP >50  µV). 
4) Expand the stimulated area as long as reproducible motor responses emerge.  
5) Identify the location giving rise to the largest m.EDC EMG response  - the target for rTMS  
5.[ADDRESS_801283] strong, repeatable MEPs.  
5.3 NOTE: The location  chosen may not be the absolute highest amplitude MEP from the 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  We are trying to find a location that represents the strong center of activation 
for hand and finger muscles, shown by [CONTACT_605141].  We want to avoid 
selecting an isolated a ctivation center for EDC far from M1, or one that represents a 
transient high fluctuation in cortical excitability.  
 
6) Test coil orientations in this location as done in initial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_605049] m.EDC and will be used as the target location for subsequent 
MT determinations and delivering [ADDRESS_801284] m.EDC response from

3) In the end of the iteration, the software  displays the patient’s motor threshold value as a

RTMS stimulation  
1) Select the stimulus corresponding to the largest m.EDC response from refined motor 
mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (same stimulus as used as reference during refined M T determination) and set it 
as Repeat Stimulus  
2) Position therapy coil using coil positioning holder to location guided by [CONTACT_605143]  
3) Select rTMS sequence containing 900 stimuli at 1 Hz (15 minute duration)  
4) Check that the intensity corresponds to 110 % of t he refined m.EDC MT defined in 
previous step  
5) Start rTMS sequence and monitor coil position  
OFF-LINE ANALYSIS  
1) From details of the therapy rTMS sequence review statistics for accuracy of pulses in 
relation to the reference pulse / first pulse of sequence, i. e. how well the coil stayed in 
place during the sequence run.  
2) From motor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], identify optimal m.APB and EDC locations (the stimulus location 
evoking the largest EMG responses, respectively).   
3) Define coil coordinates, coordinates on the chosen stimula tion surface (3D -MR image), 
and coordinates at fixed depth (25 mm from the scalp surface). Review MEP traces and 
correct the amplitudes and latencies if needed.  
4) Capture all stimuli eliciting muscle responses with normal latencies and greater than or 
equal to 50 µV in relaxed muscles.

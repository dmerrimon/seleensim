 May 13, 2016 Synopsis  
Title  Systems Bi ology of Inactivated Influenza V accine (IIV) in healthy 
adults with or without use of broad spectrum antibiotics  
Short Title  Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics  
Rationale  Use of antibiotics can significantly impact the microbiota of patients. 
The status of the intestinal microbiome may impact the immune 
responses to vaccinations and alter functional protective immunity in 
humans. Here we hypothesize that the changes in the fecal 
microbiome induced by [CONTACT_599978]  (HAI) titers.  
Clinical Phase  N/A  
Mechanistic Study  Yes 
Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_470849], MD (PI)   
Participating Site(s)  The Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center  
The Hope Clinic is a community -based vaccine research clinic and is 
the clinical arm of the Emory Vaccine Center at Emory University.  
Accrual Objective  N=50 total (age 18 -40) 
Primary Study Objective  To compare HAI titers after vaccination with IIV in adults with or 
without use of antibiotics  
Study Design  Single center, open mechanistic study in which subjects will be 
randomized to receive IIV per label at day 4 of a 5 day course of a 
specific antibiotic regimen (Group A) or IIV  alone (Group B)  
Blood samples for immunologic testing will be collected at screening  
(from D -21 to D -1), on D0 (at vaccination), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day), 
D30 (+/ - 5 days) , D90 (+/ -14 days) , D180 (+ -/14 days) , D365 (+/ -28 
days)  post vaccination for both groups to study innate and/or 
adaptive immune responses.  
Stool samples will be collected in both groups at screening (from D -
21 to D -1), on vaccination (D0), D1, D3, D7 (+/ - 1 day) and D30 (+/ - 
5 days ), D90 (+/ -14 days) , D180 ( +/-14 days) , D365 (+/ - 28 days) to 
study the gut microbiome  in both groups . For Group A, additional 
visit on D -6 to D -3 will occur with stool and blood sample s collection.   
Study will be conducted outside the 2014 -2015 and 2015 -2016 
influenza season s.

 May 13, 2016 Antibiotics received by [CONTACT_26374] A will be started 3 days prior to 
vaccination (D -3) and continued on day of vaccination (D0) and for 
one day after vaccination (D1) for a total of 5 days  
 Flagyl® 500 mg po tid  
 Vancocin® 125 mg po qid  
 Neomycin sulfate ® 500mg po tid  
The dosage of each antibiotic is taken from their respective package 
inserts and does not exceed the maximum dose allowed for each 
antibiotic.  
The antibiotic regimen is a broad spectrum regimen covering all types 
of fecal flora (anaerobes, gram pos itive, and gram negative bacteria); 
has a good safety record; has poor systemic absorption for part of the 
regimen (Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate® ); and  part of the 
regimen is used to treat Clostridium difficile infections (Vancocin® and 
Flagyl®).   
Subjects in Group A a re asked to avoid all ethanol and any ethanol -
containing drugs while taking antibiotics and for 48h before and after 
taking the antibiotics.  
Blood samples for safety laboratory testing (including CBC with 
differential, creatinine, pota ssium) will be collected at screening (from 
D-21 to D -1) and D 7 (+/ - 1 day) for both g roup s.  
For Group A, stools will be screened for Clostridium difficile  carriage 
by [CONTACT_365138] (from D -21 to D -1).  
Study Duration  Approximately  [ADDRESS_794654] vaccination in both groups  
Secondary Endpoints  
 Frequency, severity, and causality of all adverse events in Group A 
subjects.  
Exploratory Endpoints   Analyses of microbiome at D0, D1, D3, D7,  D30 , D90 , 
D180 , D365  and comparison to baseline screening in 
both groups  
 Analysis of the repertoire and monoclonal antibodies from 
plasmablasts in a subset of vaccinees at D7 in both groups  
 Identification of innate immune signatures (traditional 
immune parameters measurements + array -based gene 
expression) at D1 , D3 and D7 in both groups  
 Correlation of innate immune signatures at days D1 , D3 and D7 
with HAI titers at D30 in both groups  
 Comparison of HAI titers at D90 , D180  and D365  post vaccination 
in both groups .

VAX-[ADDRESS_794671] cells by a factor of ten (1). They inhabit barrier surfaces 
of major organs (e.g. skin) and tissues (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) and have evolved beneficial 
properties for the host that permits a symbiotic relationship to be maintained with the host (2). 
These include an array of functions ranging from enhancing digestion and metabolism to 
occupying a niche that competes against colonization with invasive pathogens (3-7). Moreover, 
associations between alterations or dysbiosis of the microbiota and susceptibility to metabolic and 
pro-inflammatory diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel diseases in 
humans have been widely reported (8-10). Thus, interactions between the host and microbiota 
are crucial factors supporting the balance of their symbiotic relationship. 
Evidence emerging from the past decade highlights additional roles for the microbiota, most 
notably in influencing the development and homeostasis of the host immune system. Studies of 
germ-free animals, which are devoid of any detectable microorganisms, have revealed that 
commensal-derived signals are critical for maintaining a balance of pro-inflammatory and 
regulatory immune mechanisms (11-16). Germ-free mice exhibit reduced capacity of T cells to 
mount IL-17A and IFNg responses in both gut-associated tissues and the skin. Furthermore, 
these mice also exhibit increased frequency of regulatory CD4 T cells. Recent studies using 
animal model systems have also identified specific commensal species that can either promote 
pro-inflammatory or immunoregulatory pathways in the host. For example, colonization of mouse 
gut with segmented filamentous bacteria results in enhanced levels of Th17 cells in the gut (17), 
while Bacteroidetes fragilis or Clostridium subspecies results in the induction IL-10 responses and 
regulatory CD4+ T cells (18-20). Also, previous studies in mice have empi[INVESTIGATOR_599948] – via orally administered broad-spectrum antibiotics can 
influence the development and homeostasis of the immune system (11-13, 17-19, 21-25). 
Together, these observations indicate that specific composition of microbiota is an important 
factor influencing the host immune system. Thus, it also suggests that any alterations to the gut 
microbiota can influence the capacity of the host immune system to mount or regulate responses 
against pathogens appropriately. Accordingly, several reports using mice suggest that in the 
absence of the microbiota, host susceptibility to infection is enhanced and the capacity to control 
the infection is compromised. 
VAX-[ADDRESS_794672] vaccine efficacy. Currently, there is no published information in both 
humans and animal models whether the microbiota impacts the magnitude and/or quality of 
vaccine-induced immune responses. Examining the relationship between microbiota and vaccine 
immunogenicity is a novel concept, and understanding how such a phenomenon operates is a 
critical field to study. In this regard, the seasonal influenza vaccine would be an important area to 
focus upon given that it is one of the most widely and frequently administered vaccines worldwide. 
The goal of our study is to determine whether alteration of microbiota by [CONTACT_599979], and to assess the innate and adaptive immune 
mechanisms responsible for that phenomenon. 
 
 
1.2 Immune Response to IIV Given With Antibiotics 
Recent work from our group at the Emory Vaccine Center (Pulendran Laboratory) on the systems 
biology of the influenza vaccine has revealed a network of genes centered around TLR5 (26), 
which were found to be induced robustly in humans [ADDRESS_794673]-spectrum antibiotics (Neomycin, Ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312], Vancomycin,

 May 13, 2016 Metronidazole) via their drinking water to eliminate the microbiota as previously described (12, 
13, 20, 21, 25). Antibiotics were administered for [ADDRESS_794674] vaccination, mice treated with antibiotics exhibited greater than 
50% reduction in antigen-specific antibody titers in the serum when compared to untreated mice 
.We observed differences in antibody titers over periods exceeding [ADDRESS_794675]/recall antibody responses are also reduced in 
antibiotic-treated mice. 
In addition, we conducted longitudinal microbiome sampling in both untreated and antibiotic-
treated animal groups to determine whether the impact of antibiotics on the humoral immune 
response can be attributed to compositional differences in the gut microbiota. The microbiome 
was analyzed using bacterial genomic DNA extracted from fecal samples and the 454 
pyrosequencing platform to identify specific bacterial communities. A sequence clustering 
software originally developed by [CONTACT_599980]'s group was used to determine the composition of 
the microbiota as previously described (27). The details of analysis methods are highlighted in 
9.2.3.Analysis of exploratory endpoints. Our characterization of the microbiota in mice revealed 
that antibiotic treatment indeed reduced the bacterial load in the gut by a factor greater than ten 
and caused dramatic shifts in major bacterial communities of the gut. Specifically, greatest 
changes were observed in bacterial phyla, Fermicutes and Proteobacteria. The microbiota of 
untreated mice exhibited a greater presence of bacterial communities belonging to the Fermicutes 
phylum; whereas in treated mice, majority of these communities were eliminated and instead 
exhibited a predominance of species from the Proteobacteria phylum. 
This indicated to us that the effects antibiotics and the status of the microbiota around the time of 
vaccination significantly impacted the antibody response. Collectively, our studies demonstrate 
that antibiotic treatment dramatically alters the composition of the host microbiota and results in 
dramatic reduction of antigen-specific antibody titers similar to the phenotype we previously 
observed in TLR5-deficient mice. 
It is unclear how antibiotic exposure affects the human microbiota. Historical evidence on the 
effects of antibiotics in vivo is largely based on biologic assays that require culturing microbes. As 
the majority of microbial communities in the gut are anaerobes and, thus, difficult to culture, the

 May 13, 2016 accuracy of our understanding of the microbiota remains limited (2). However, recent advances 
in pyrosequencing technologies are enabling a more detailed analysis of the human microbiome 
to be assessed (28-30). A few reports suggested that some antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin do 
alter the human microbiota, but revealed that only as little as a third of the bacterial taxa in the 
gut were affected by [CONTACT_599981] (31, 32). Moreover, analyses of the microbiome in these 
studies were limited to only an examination on the relative abundance of microbial communities 
and lacked quantifiable information such as overall bacterial load in the gut. Thus, given the 
relatively nascent stage of our capacity to characterize the human gut microbiome, our 
understanding of how it is influenced by [CONTACT_599982]. 
Using the data generated from our series of clinical flu vaccination trials (21), we found that the 
early induction of TLR5 expression (Day0 vs Day3 post vaccination) positively correlated to the 
levels of HAI titers measured on Day28 post vaccination. We have since demonstrated a causal 
link between TLR5 signaling and induction of antibody responses to IIV in mice. Determining 
whether a functional link can be established in humans is very challenging to address. However, 
one potential approach is to determine whether polymorphisms within the TLR5 gene contribute 
to responsiveness of a given individual to vaccination. We are specifically interested in the 
commonly-known TLR5 stop codon polymorphism (Hawn et al., 2003. J. Exp. Med.). This 
polymorphism refers to a SNP at nucleotide position 1174 (C -> T) resulting in a stop codon 
replacing arginine at amino acid position 392. This allele has been characterized as a dominant 
loss- of-function mutation as humans that are heterozygotes fail to respond to flagellin. Therefore, 
this is a highly intriguing and relevant SNP that will enable us to address a role of TLR5 expression 
in humans to vaccine-induced antibody responses. 
In summary, the data from our experiments in mice suggest a novel role for commensal microbiota 
in enhancing vaccine-elicited immunity. Determining whether these effects are seen in humans 
after vaccination is vital to improve and optimize vaccine efficacy. Thus, we propose to apply our 
experimental data from mice to examine whether exposure to antibiotics given around vaccination 
in humans will negatively impact the ensuing immune response.

 May 13, 2016 1.3 Rationale for Selection of Study Population 
Twenty two healthy adults with no co-morbidities between the ages of 18-40 years will be recruited 
from the general population of metro Atlanta and enrolled at the Hope Clinic, located in downtown 
Decatur. In previous studies done at the Hope Clinic, 60% of subjects were female and 40% were 
male with good racial representation (55% Caucasian, 35% African American and 10% Asian). 
We chose the above age range to avoid the effect of immune senescence on vaccine efficacy 
since immune responses to IIV are known to decrease with age (33). Additionally, discharge rate 
for Clostridium difficile  infection (CDI) from US short-stay hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599949] 18 to 44 and is less than 2.5 cases per 1000 discharges (42). This rate does 
not seem to be affected by [CONTACT_599983] a hypervirulent strain of Clostridium difficile  
(NAP1/BI/027) resistant to quinolones (40). Therefore our study subjects will be healthy adults 
between the ages of 18-[ADDRESS_794676](s)/Intervention (s) 
The vaccine used in the study will be the seasonal 2014-2015 and 2015- 2016 Fluzone ® 
manufactured by [CONTACT_35346] (Swiftwater, PA  [LOCATION_003])(34). Subjects in the study will receive the 
routine adult dose of 0.5 ml given by [CONTACT_125620] (IM) route. Fluzone® will be obtained from 
the Emory University pharmacy. 
The antibiotic regimen will be given 3 days prior to vaccination, on the vaccination day, and one 
day after vaccination for a total for 5 days.  The regimen will include the following antibiotics: 
Flagyl ®(35) [COMPANY_007], [LOCATION_001], NY) 500 mg po tid 
Vancocin® (36) (ViroPharma , Exton, PA) 125 mg po qid 
Neomycin sulfate® (37) (X-Gen Pharmaceuticals, Big flats, NY) [ADDRESS_794677](s)/Intervention(s) and Regimen 
The majority of studies demonstrating that antibiotic-mediated depletion of host microbiota 
influence the development and homeostasis of the immune system employed a specific cocktail 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 of antibiotics consisting of Ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312] (1 g/L), Neomycin (1 g/L), Vancomycin (0.5 g/L), and 
Metronidazole (0.5 g/L).  
The basis for using this particular combination of antibiotics is to enable a wide spectrum of 
microbial communities to be targeted for depletion. Indeed, at the indicated doses, this cocktail 
has been shown to effectively deplete more than 90% of the existing flora in the gut and drastically 
alter the composition of the microbiota (22, 25). Specifically, the greatest changes were observed 
in bacterial phyla, Fermicutes and Proteobacteria as seen also in our independent experiments.  
For this study we will use a broad spectrum antibiotic regimen affecting all bacteria in the gut flora 
based on our mice experiments that includes:  Vancocin® (with activity against gram positive 
bacteria), Flagyl® (with activity against anaerobes) and Neomycin sulfate® (with activity against 
gram negative bacteria).  
Additional characteristics of antibiotics selected in the regimen include: 
- Poor systemic absorption for Vancocin® and Neomycin sulfate® (3%) when given orally 
which should result in less systemic side effects. 
- Good safety profile for all 3 of these antibiotics used for more than half a century 
(Flagyl® was developed in 1960, Vancocin® in 1953 and Neomycin sulfate® in 1949). 
- Although any antibiotic can cause Clostridium difficile -associated colitis, the current 
regimen includes Vancocin® and Flagyl®, both used at the same cumulative daily 
dosage to treat Clostridium difficile  infection but administered in a shorter course of 5 
days. For Neomycin sulfate®, the cumulative daily dosages are less than half of the 
minimum daily dosage used to treat adult hepatic encephalopathy and a 5-day course is 
same as that required for treating adult hepatic encephalopathy. 
This antibiotic regimen (Vancocin®, Flagyl® and Neomycin sulfate®) will be administered three 
days before vaccination with IIV, on the day of vaccination and one day post-vaccination in 
subjects randomized to Group A (subjects in Group B will only receive IIV). This short course 
reduces the potential risk of bacterial and fungal superinfection, as well as preventing the 
development of antibiotic resistance.

IIV 
Routine influenza vaccination is now recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months.  Fluzonex® 
is an FDA approved IIV manufactured [COMPANY_011] Pasteur (Swiftwater, PA  [LOCATION_003]) and indicated for 
active immunization of persons [ADDRESS_794679] common (>10%) local 
adverse reactions and general adverse events observed with Fluzone® when given to adults were 
pain and redness at the injection site, and muscle aches, fatigue, and headache, respectively 
(34).  
Acute and potentially life-threatening allergic reactions are also possible, especially in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_599950] a history of severe egg allergy (34). As noted in the exclusion criteria, 
for safety considerations, individuals with an allergy to eggs will be excluded from this study. In 
addition, vaccinations will be administered per label and in clinical settings equipped to manage 
any potential allergic reactions that may occur following vaccine administration. 
Associated with the [ADDRESS_794680] individuals who develop Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
recover completely, although the recovery period may vary from weeks to a few years. Of those 
who develop Guillain-Barré Syndrome, approximately 30% continue to exhibit residual weakness 
after 3 years, and approximately 3% suffer a relapse of muscle weakness and tingling sensations 
years after the initial attack. Intensive surveillance of Guillain-Barré Syndrome following 
administration of inactivated influenza vaccines since 1976 has shown a slight increase in risk 
over background cases (more than one additional case of Guillain-Barré Syndrome per million 
persons) following vaccination, typi[INVESTIGATOR_99927] 6 weeks after vaccination (38). 
Interestingly, although vaccination rates have increased in the last [ADDRESS_794681] declined (39). 
Randomized, controlled clinical trials of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine in patients with

vaccination.

in ICU admissions, colectomy, and deaths, mostly occurring in elderly patients or patients with 
co-morbidities (41).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599952]-stay hospi[INVESTIGATOR_599953] 18 to 44 and is less than 2.5 cases per 1000 discharges 
(42). This rate does not seem to be affected by [CONTACT_599983] a hypervirulent strain of

be healthy adults between the ages of 18-[ADDRESS_794683] frequently associated with the epi[INVESTIGATOR_498310] (43).   
Flagyl®  
The most serious adverse reactions reported in patients treated with Flagyl® have been 
convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy (35).  
Peripheral neuropathy is characterized mainly by [CONTACT_599984] (35). 
The most common adverse reactions reported have been referable to the gastrointestinal tract, 
particularly nausea, reported by [CONTACT_3450] 12% of patients, and can be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_12704], anorexia, and occasionally vomiting; diarrhea; epi[INVESTIGATOR_22624]; and abdominal 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (35).  
Vancocin®  
Nephrotoxicity (renal failure, renal impairment, blood creatinine increased) has occurred following 
oral VANCOCIN therapy in randomized controlledclinical studies, and can occur either during or 
after completion of therapy. The risk of nephrotoxicity is increased in patients >65 years of age 
(36). 
Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin (36). It may be transient or permanent, 
but has been reported mainly in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who 
have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic 
agent, such as an aminoglycoside (36). 
VAX-[ADDRESS_794684] common (>10%) adverse reactions associated with the use of Vancocin® in clinical 
trials included nausea (17%), abdominal pain (15%) and hypokalemia (13%). Other adverse 
events (>5%) included peripheral edema, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, flatulence, urinary 
tract infection, back pain and headache. Also important/life-threatening side effects are rare (<1%) 
and include vasculitis, thrombocytopenia, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity (36).  
Neomycin sulfate®  
Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuromuscular blockage have been reported with the use of 
Neomycin sulfate® (37). Manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, 
muscle twitching, and convulsions (37). The risk of hearing loss continues after drug withdrawal 
(37). Subjects concurrently receiving other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs may have can 
have a possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of neomycin (37). 
Concurrent or serial use of other aminoglycosides and polymyxins may enhance neomycin’s 
nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate neomycin sulfate’s neuromuscular blocking 
effects (37). 
The most common adverse reactions to oral neomycin sulfate are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea 
(37).  
All three antibiotics in this regimen can lead to the overgrowth of non-susceptible bacteria. 
1.6.2 Risk of Study Procedure 
The discomforts of this study include having blood drawn, intramuscular (IM) injection, and 
possible allergic reactions to the components of IIV and the antibiotics.  
Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting. Bruising at the blood draw 
site may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_599985]. Intramuscular injection may also cause transient discomfort. The use of aseptic 
technique will make infection at the site where blood will be drawn or where the vaccination is 
given extremely unlikely. Vaccines used in the study will be a single dose syringe preventing the 
risk of over or under dosing and the potential risk of contamination.

 May 13, 2016 6 OTHER MEDICATIONS 
6.1 Concomitant Medications 
In accordance with exclusion criteria, subjects expected to receive prohibited medications (see 
section 6.4) will be considered ineligible for the study. All medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or vaccines 
administered to study subjects after study entry will be documented at each visit. 
6.2 Prophylactic Medications 
Prophylactic medications will not be administered before vaccination or any other study 
procedures. 
6.3 Rescue Medications 
We do not anticipate the use of any rescue medication; however, should anaphylactic or 
hypersensitivity reactions occur, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000) and diphenhydramine injections are readily 
available at the Hope Clinic during vaccine use. 
When facing a medical emergency, the clinic staff will follow the institutional SOP by [CONTACT_3379] [ADDRESS_794701] after vaccine administration. 
6.4 Concomitant Study Medications 
All medications and vaccines received by [CONTACT_599992].  This includes, but is not limited to, the 
following: 
• blood products, chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy (including anti-INF 
therapy), and radiation therapy (administered at any time after study vaccination)  
• inactivated vaccines (administered before the day 30 blood draw) 
• live-attenuated vaccine (administered before the day 30 blood draw) 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 • any antibiotic aside from the study antibiotic (taken before the day 30 blood draw). 
• any probiotics and prebiotics (taken before the day 30 blood draw). 
• any proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers, or antacids (taken before the day 
30 blood draw). 
Any of the above medications could affect the innate and adaptive assay results and should not 
be used unless medically indicated.  
Upon the discretion of the PI, subjects receiving concomitant medications may still continue with 
scheduled study blood draws. Subjects receiving concomitant medications and early terminated 
subjects may be replaced as needed to preserve the statistical power needed to substantiate the 
primary endpoint. (Refer to section 9.1.). 
VAX-[ADDRESS_794702] will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any screening study procedures. 
Subjects who are deemed eligible for the study (see sections 4.1 and 4.2) will be enrolled and 
assigned a unique subject number. Enrollment will occur over an approximate 6-month time span.  
The duration of participation for each subject is approximately 1 year 
Twenty-two subjects will be randomized to Group A (receiving antibiotics) or to Group B (not 
receiving antibiotics) in a 1:1 ratio. All eligible subjects will receive IIV at D0. 
7.2 Screening Visit(s) (From D-21  until D-1) 
Subjects responding to study ads will call the Hope Clinic for a telephone screening where the 
eligibility criteria of the subject will be reviewed. If the subject is found to be eligible and continues 
to be interested in participating after reading the informed consent (emailed or mailed to him/her), 
a screening and enrollment appointment will be scheduled. Study staff will review the informed 
consent form with the subject and will answer all questions related to the study.  
Once the subject signs the informed consent, a study participation number will be assigned. The 
volunteer will be asked to provide demographic information and information related to his/her 
medical history, including current medication use and vaccination history. The subject’s vital signs 
will be recorded, and a targeted physical exam will be conducted as indicated, based on review 
of the subject’s health status. For female volunteers who are of childbearing potential, a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed. Only females with a negative urine pregnancy test will be 
enrolled in the study. All subjects will have a stool sample collected from them. A stool kit will be 
mailed prior to the visit. 
The subjects will be randomized to be in Group A or Group B in a 1:[ADDRESS_794703] blood 
drawn (to measure CBC with differential, creatinine, and potassium) and immunologic assays .  
This visit will last approximately 60 minutes.

8.2 Adverse Events 
This section defines the types of adverse events that may occur, and outlines the procedures for 
appropriately adverse event collecting, grading, recording, and reporting.   
Information in this section complies with 21CFR 312; ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice; and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [Published: May 28, 2009; revised 
version 4.03; June 14. 2010, http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html] 
These criteria have been reviewed by [CONTACT_599995]. 
8.2.1 Safety Reporting 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events (AE) 
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An adverse event can 
arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from 
any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.  
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
SARs after vaccine administration may include: 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 • Local reactions: hardening of the skin at the injection site, injection site redness, 
injection site swelling, pain at the site of injection, bruising of the skin at the 
injection site. 
• Systemic reactions: aching muscles, headache, joint pain, fatigue, fever, and 
shivering.   
[IP_ADDRESS] SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) OR SERIOUS SUSPECTED 
ADVERSE REACTION 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of the 
investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Life-Threatening Adverse Event or Life-Threatening Suspected 
Adverse Reaction 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life-threatening’’ if, in the view of 
the investigator, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  
VAX-[ADDRESS_794713] caused death. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
Reaction 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if the Summary of Product Characteristics is not required or available, is not 
consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in 
the current application, as amended.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
‘‘Unexpected,’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Independent Safety Monitoring 
The ISM is a physician with relevant expertise in vaccine trials whose primary responsibility will 
be to provide independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion and to provide recommendations 
regarding the safe continuation of this study.  
The ISM will evaluate safety data generated from study subjects including all SAEs against the 
known safety profile of the study vaccine to assess for possible changes to the overall risk of the 
study.   
Contact [CONTACT_599996] [ADDRESS_794714] 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_599966]. The study has provisions for a back-up ISM to ensure that independent safety 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 monitoring happens at all times during the study. Additional roles and responsibilities of the ISM 
are described in section 8.2.4 below. 
8.2.2 Collecting and Recording Adverse Events and Pregnancy 
 
Adverse events may be identified during this study through any of these methods: 
1.  Examination of the subject during study visits. 
2.  Questioning the subject during study visits. 
3.  Receiving a safety report from the subject at any time during the study  
Note: subjects will be asked to call the site if they develop any of the following: 
• Illness or treatment from a physician or emergency department the entire duration of 
the study; 
• Any adverse event that limits self-care activities of daily living (e.g.  bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed ridden) 
even if he/she decides not to seek medical care; 
• Local REs and/or systemic REs of grade 3 or higher severity after the previous visit 
(only until Day 7 Visit). 
4. Receiving a safety report from subject in Group A if they: 
• Develop any symptoms while on antibiotics  
• Develop any of the following until D90: 
o diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools/24h) for more than 72h with either fever or 
abdominal pain 
o tinnitus 
o vertigo* 
o decrease hearing 
o numbness/tingling 
 
A complete recording of safety events in the CRF will include event term, date(s) of onset and 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 resolution/stabilization, assessment of severity, relationship to study vaccine or 
procedures/intervention(s) such as phlebotomy, expectedness, determination of whether the AE 
qualifies as serious or non-serious, treatment required, action taken with study participation, and 
outcome. AEs qualifying as serious also require a narrative of the event. Updates in safety events 
will be recorded as additional information becomes available. 
Adverse events will be followed until they are resolved. Resolution of an AE is defined as the 
return to baseline status or as stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain 
chronic. 
Information on pregnancies will be collected from the time a subject signs the consent until the 
subject completes study participation.  Cumulatively monthly reports of safety data will capture 
any pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes at least on a quarterly basis. 
 If a subject becomes pregnant after study entry, the investigator will discuss with the subject 
and/or the treating physician the known possible risks to the fetus. 
Subjects becoming pregnant after study entry will be withdrawn from the study and followed until 
the end of the pregnancy.  A pregnancy resulting in congenital anomaly/birth defect will be 
considered a SAE. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will also be reported a nd 
assessed as an SAE as needed. 
8.2.3 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Grading Criteria 
Adverse events will be graded according to the criteria set forth in the National Cancer Institute’s 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 [May 28, 2009;revised version 
4.03; June 14. 2010,  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html] 
This document (referred to herein as the NCI-CTCAE manual) provides a common language to 
describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance 
of all adverse events.   
All adverse events whether or not listed in the NCI-CTCAE will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 
according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual (A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within 
the description of the grade): 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL*. 
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**. 
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5 Death related to AE. 
*Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
**Self-care  Activities of Daily Living (ADL)   refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 
 
Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs; therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than five 
options for Grade selection.  
Anaphylaxis is a disorder characterized by [CONTACT_599997]-like substances from mast cells, causing a hypersensitivity 
immune response. Clinically, it presents with breathing difficulty, dizziness, hypotension, cyanosis 
and loss of consciousness and may lead to death. 
Severity grading of anaphylaxis as per the NCI-CTCAE manual is as follows: 
Grade 1= not applicable 
Grade 2= not applicable 
Grade 3= Symptomatic bronchospasm, with or without urticaria; parenteral intervention 
indicated; allergy-related edema/angioedema; hypotension 
Grade 4= Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 Grade 5= Death  
Severity grading of AEs of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed as per the NCI-CTCAE 
manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Attribution 
The site investigator will initially determine the relationship of an adverse event to the study 
vaccine or study procedures (blood draw). The investigator’s determination of causality will be 
used for FDA reporting purposes.  
The relationship of an AE to study participation will be determined using definitions in the table 
below:

The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_311028], including SAEs 
requiring expedited review by [CONTACT_599998], to the IRB in accordance with IRB regulations and guidelines. 
8.3 Protocol Deviations 
Deviations occur when the Investigator, site study staff, or subjects fail to adhere to protocol 
requirements or when there is non-adherence to (GCP) as delineated in ICH E6 (R1) guidelines.   
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the study staff will a) notify the 
Principal Investigator, and b) will complete the Protocol Deviation form. There could be a 
discussion between the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599969]/her further study participation, the effect of the protocol 
deviation on the overall study, and corrective actions.   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_599970], per IRB regulations.   
Identification of protocol deviations will be done through the quality manager at the study site. 
Reviewing and reporting of minor protocol deviations will be discussed at the Hope Clinic monthly 
meetings. Major protocol deviations will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_470880].  
All study deviations will be captured in monthly reports along with safety data and forwarded to 
the ISM.

 May 13, 2016 9 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS AND STATISTICAL 
PLAN 
9.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
Based on previous studies performed at the Hope Clinic, the rate of subjects that become 
ineligible during the study (i.e. do not meet exclusion/inclusion criteria anymore, lost to follow-ups, 
unable to have blood draws) is between 5 to 10%. Assuming a 10% attrition rate, 50 healthy 
adults will be recruited for the study, resulting in an expected 10 subjects per arm for data analysis. 
In the case that the sample size of subjects missing any of the 2 draws required for the primary 
endpoint [meaning draws at days 0 and day 30] is higher than 10% of the 50 subjects to be 
recruited for the study, we will recruit extra patients to maintain the target sample size of 10/group 
and the statistical power to prove primary endpoint. 
9.1.1 Primary and Secondary Endpoints 
The comparison of HAI titer will be conducted in three ways: direct comparison of HAI titers, 
comparing seroprotection rate, and comparing seroconversion rate. 
For the comparison of the mean log2 HAI titers between the two groups, with [ADDRESS_794719] the null hypothesis of equal means with 80% power 
if the true effect size ((mean0-mean1)/sigma, assuming equal variance) is 1.[ADDRESS_794720]. 
Based on a previous study of Fluzone® in a large cohort, we expect 98% of subjects without 
antibiotics treatment will reach seroprotection, i.e. HAI titers of ≥1:40. Our null hypothesis is the 
two groups have equal proportions of subjects who will reach seroprotection, and the alternative 
hypothesis is the antibiotic treatment lowers the proportion of subjects reaching seroprotection. 
The sample size of 10 subjects per treatment group will allow us 80% power to detect a difference 
in proportions of 0.[ADDRESS_794721] of two proportions using a significance level of 
0.05.  
Based on a previous study of Fluzone® in a large cohort, we expect 65% of subjects without 
antibiotics treatment will achieve seroconversion, i.e. ≥four-fold increase in HAI titers over 
baseline. The sample size of 10 subjects per treatment group will allow us 80% power to detect 
VAX-[ADDRESS_794722] of two proportions using a 
significance level of 0.05. 
9.2 Data Analysis 
Data from the study will be analyzed using the statistical software R .  High-throughput data will 
be analyzed using appropriate methods, either by [CONTACT_599999]-alone software or modules in leading 
statistical softwares, e.g. the Bioconductor in the R framework (44). For cytokine data, missing 
values will be dealt with using multiple imputations. For microarray data, nearest neighbor method 
and local least squares may be used to fill missing values. Unsupervised learning techniques 
such as PCA, PLSDA, clustering, and factor analysis will be used for the visualization and 
identification of global patterns (45). For descriptive endpoints, we will generate summary 
statistics, and visualize the data using histograms and boxplots when applicable. For the 
identification of innate signatures, the two treatment groups will be analyzed separately. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_794723] is directly comparing HAI titers between the treatment groups; 
the second is comparing the proportions of subjects achieving seroprotection from each group; 
and the third is comparing the proportions of subjects achieving seroconversion from each group.  
The first data analysis route is directly comparing the means/medians of the HAI titers between 
the two groups at D 30. We will first log2 – transform the HAI titers for each subject. The log2 HAI 
titers of each group will be summarized and presented using histograms and strip charts for visual 
comparison. We will use the t-test to compare the mean log2 HAI titers between the two groups. 
The Wilcoxon test may also be used depending on the distribution of the data.  
In addition, we will compare the two groups based on the proportion of achieving seroprotection 
and seroconversion. For seroprotection, we will dichotomize the outcome into D 30 HAI titer ≥1:40 
or D30 HAI titer <1:40. For seroconvertion, we will dichotomize the outcome into D 30 HAI titer 
≥four-fold or <four-fold rise relative to baseline titer. If a subject has negative titer at D0, we will 
consider the subject a seroconverter if his/her HAI reaches 1:40 at D 30. We will then compare 
the two treatment groups by [CONTACT_14664] a Fisher’s exact test on the 2×2 contingency table of 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 treatment versus dichotomized HAI titers. We will also report the estimated proportion of 
seroprotection/seroconversion and its 95% confidence interval for each group. 
9.2.2 Analyses of Secondary Endpoint 
9.2.3 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
Exploratory Endpoint 1: Analyses of microbiome at D0, D7, and D30 in Group A and 
comparison to baseline Screening 
Sequence results will be analyzed using the open source software package called Quantitative 
Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) (46). Primary objective of our analyses will be to 
characterize the composition of microbiota samples and to identify specific microbial communities 
significantly associated with an experimental group. 
Prior to analysis, sequences will undergo quality filtering using QIIME and the sequence quality 
scores annotated to each raw sequence data. The 16s gene sequences will be aligned and 
clustered using UCLUST, which is based on a pair-wise identity threshold of 97% (47). Clustered 
sequences will be assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (48). A single representative 
sequence for each OTU will be aligned using PyNAST   to enable taxonomic classification and 
generation of phylogenetic trees for subsequent analyses (46, 49, 50). 
OTUs with taxonomic assignments will allow QIIME to assemble a matrix of OTU abundance in 
each sample. This matrix will then be used to summarize communities by [CONTACT_600000], which can be visualized together as area/bar graphs or heatmaps. Information 
from phylogenetic trees will be used to compute distances or levels of dissimilarity between 
microbial communities using Unifrac (51). This tool will enable compositional comparisons 
between samples (beta diversity) to be conducted. For this purpose, we will use the OTU matrix 
to calculate distance or dissimilarity of samples between experimental groups using weighted and 
unweighted UniFrac metrics. QIIME will then generate [ADDRESS_794724] of Independence to identify OTUs that are differentially represented across experimental 
groups. This tool will also be conducted and applied to the beta diversity Principal Coordinate 
Analyses to help explain which OTUs are significantly associated with a particular experimental 
group.

Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 For longitudinal analyses of samples within each group, semivariogram plots will be generated 
using dissimilarity metrics over time (Euclidean) plotted against community dissimilarity (UniFrac) 
(46,52). 
Exploratory endpoint 2: Analysis of the repertoire and monoclonal antibodies from 
plasmablasts in a subset of vaccinees at D7 in both groups 
The repertoire and monoclonal antibody levels will be presented as descriptions of the actual 
values. Summary statistics, boxplots and histograms will be used to summarize the data. 
Exploratory endpoint 3: Identification of innate immune signatures (traditional immune 
parameters measurements + array-based gene expression) at D1, D3 and D7 in both 
groups 
We will take the measurements on the day of vaccination as baseline. For traditional immune 
parameters, we will test if an immune parameter shows significant change over baseline at day 
1, 3, and [ADDRESS_794725]. Fold-change (ratio between the 
mean values of the two groups) will be combined with the test p-value in a selection criterion as 
appropriate. Based on previous studies similar in nature, the tentative selection criterion is p-value 
≤ 0.01 and fold change ≥ 3.  
For the gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) 
with paired design to find differentially expressed genes (53). False discovery rate (FDR) will be 
used as selection criterion (54). The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1. 
Exploratory endpoint 4: Correlation of innate immune signatures at days D1, D3 and D7 
with HAI titers at D30 in both groups 
For traditional immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the 
immune parameter and the adaptive immune response (HAI titers at D30) he p-values associated 
with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune parameters that are 
associated with the respective adaptive immune responses. The tentative selection criterion is p-
value ≤ 0.01.  
For gene expression data, we will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) 
with quantitative outcome to identify genes that are significantly associated with the respective 
VAX-002 CONFIDENTIAL Page 57 of 73 
  
Responses to IIV in adults with or without antibiotics .          Version 6. 0
 May 13, 2016 adaptive immune responses (HAI titers at D30 ). False discovery rate (FDR) will be used as 
selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 0.1. 
Exploratory endpoint 5 : Comparison of HAI Titers at D30 Post-Vaccination in Both Groups 
Analysis similar to 9.2.1. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_794726] Baseline Characteristics and Demographics 
A summary of descriptive statistics for baseline and demographic characteristics will be provided 
for all enrolled subjects. Demographic data will include age, race, sex, and medical history, 
including current medication use and vaccination history.

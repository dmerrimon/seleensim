I. Aims of the Study: Describe the aims/objectives of the research and/or the project’s research questions or 
hypotheses.  
 
“Advancing stated -preference methods for measuring the preferences of patients with type 2 diabetes” focuses on 
advancing methods for patient and community engagement in patient- centered outcomes research (PCOR) and 
has three objectives. First, we will demonstrate good practices for patient and community involvement in PCOR 
projects by [CONTACT_16299] -based participatory research (CBPR) to engage an advisory board, the 
Diabetes Action Board (DAB), comprised of community - and national -level stakeholders. Second, we will address 
methodological gaps pertaining to the use of stated -preference methods in PCOR. These include identifying the 
best methods for identifying patient priorities (Aim 1 ), the best method for designing a preference study (Aim 2), 
and comparing stratification versus segmentation strategies for analyzing preference heterogeneity (Aim 3). We also seek to assess the relevance of stated preference methods to patients and stakeholders using both qualitative 
and quantitative methods (Aim 4). Third, we will demonstrate good practices for applying stated -preference 
methods by [CONTACT_16300] 2 diabetes. This will provide an important 
case study for future researcher wanting to apply these methods in PCOR.  
 Research can be segmented into three phases:  
 
Phase 1: Qualitative interviews and focus gro ups with community members (n=50 ) to develop the survey, which 
will be used in part [ADDRESS_15566].  
Phase 2: Local (n=10) and national (n=50) pi[INVESTIGATOR_16281], implemented in the first year of the project.  The p ilot 
surveys will guide the national survey (n=1000), implemented during the second year of the project.  
Phase 3: Local pi[INVESTIGATOR_16282] a follow -up survey (n=20) to assess research subjects’ attitudes towards the importance 
and validity of survey results and ther eafter a national follow -up survey (n=300).  Part [ADDRESS_15567].  
 
While the work in parts 2 & [ADDRESS_15568] on both local and national levels, the general survey design and 
implementation methods will be similar . The main difference is the mode of survey delivery (local surveys will be 
primarily paper surveys, while national surveys will be electronic surveys) and appearance (GfK’s KnowledgePanel’s® online survey will have a slightly different format than the sur veys used with the local 
community).

II. Background and Rationale: Explain why this study is bein g done.  Summarize briefly what is already known about 
the issue and reference previously published research, if relevant.  
 
This project aims to address gaps in the understanding and applications of methods to conduct patient -centered 
outcomes research (PC OR) and is focused on advancing methods for engaging patients and community 
stakeholders in PCOR. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_16283], current PCORI methodology guidelines give little detail on how this s hould be done.  
 Based on current international best practices, there are two main strategies that can be applied to identify and measure the values of patients and stakeholders (Facey et al, 2010). First, patients and stakeholders can be actively 
engaged through consultation or included in decision -making panels (Barham, 2011; Vogt et al, 2006). Second, 
qualitative and quantitative research methods can be used to scientifically study what factors patients and 
stakeholders value the most (Rotter et al, 2012 ; Bridges 2006; Bridges & Jones, 2007; Lee et al, 2008). Such 
methods are often referred to as stated -preference methods as they aim to document the priorities and 
preferences of patients and stakeholders (Bridges, 2003).  
 Stated -preference methods can be qualitative, using interviews, focus groups, direct observation or meta- synthesis 
methods to document priorities and preferences (Kinter et al, 2009; Bridges, Gallego & Blauvelt 2011; Hansen et al, 
2011). Stated -preference methods can also incorporate quantitative survey approaches including rating and 
ranking (Phillips et al, 2002; Bridges, Lataille et al. 2012), willingness -to-pay (Johnson, Manjunath et al, 2006), 
conjoint analysis (Casciano et al, 2011), and best -worst scaling (Louviere & Flynn, 2010). O f these, choice -based 
conjoint analysis (also known as discrete -choice experiment) has become the most common (Ryan & Gerard, 2003; 
Bridges et al, 2008; Marshall et al 2010), and clear guidelines have emerged for utilizing them (Bridges, Hauber et 
al, 2011; Viney et al, 2002; Lancsar & Louviere, 2008).  
 
While the active engagement of patients and stakeholders and the application of stated-preference methods to 
measure the values of patients and stakeholders are both important (Facey et al, 2010) and complementary 
(Bridges, 2003), stated -preference methods have several important advantages. First, stated -preference methods 
can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data on priorities and preferences. Second, stated-preference 
methods can include large,  diverse, and often hard to reach patients and stakeholders. Third, the validity, reliability 
and generalizability of the priorities and preferences of patients and stakeholders can be evaluated statistically. 
Fourth, the preferences of different sub -group s of patients and stakeholders can be identif ied and compared using 
stratified analysis. Fifth, stated-preference methods can be used to identify groups/clusters of individuals with similar preferences and descriptive statistics can be used to describe the  membership of these groups.  
 
III. Study Design 
A. Provide an overview of your study design and methods.   
 Phase [ADDRESS_15569] (“DAB”) and will follow community based 
participatory research principles.  The DAB is comprised of [ADDRESS_15570] 
instruments. Phase 1 will involve focus groups held with people  with diabetes 2. Thes e sessions will be audio -
recorded and the recording will be destroyed after transcription.  If a participant does not wish to be recorded 
they will not participate in the focus group.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16284] 2  of the study will involve a preliminary administration of the survey instrument to 
participants with type 2 diabetes. With permission of the participants, these preliminary sessions will be audio -
recorded (after transcription, the recording will be destroyed).  The objective is to solicit feedback on the level of 
understanding of the purpose of the instrument and its structure as well as the accessibility of the language 
used.  This feedback will then be used to revise and finalize the survey instrument, which will be administered by [CONTACT_16301]’s KnowledgePanel®. Four types of conjoint analysis surveys will be utilized.    
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16284] 3  of the study will again solicit feedback on the level of understanding of the purpose of 
the follow -up study and it’s structure and language.  The results from thes e pi[INVESTIGATOR_16285]’s KnowledgePanel®, which aim to engage participants to evaluate the relevance of stated-preference methods.  
 
This application will describe only the work to be done in Phase 1. Amendments will be submitted for Phases 2 and 3 as preparations for them are developed.  
 
B. Provide a sample size and a justification as to how you arrived at that number.  If you use screening procedures to arrive at a final sample  a table may be helpful.

1. Describe the procedures that participants will undergo.  If complex, insert a table below to help the reviewer 
navigate.    
 During phase 1, semi -structured inte rviews in the form of focus groups will be conducted in person. Focus 
groups will take place at JHSPH and appropriate locations in the community as identified by [CONTACT_16306]. 
The interview will be audio recorded and will be attended by 2 study staff, the interviewer and a note-taker. When they arrive, each participant will be handed an information sheet that they can read before the start 
of the focus group and can take home. T he interviewer will begin the session by [CONTACT_16307]. They will then proceed by [CONTACT_16308]’  background s and 
experiences in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the priorities of participants with typ e 2 diabetes  (see 
Qualitative Protocol  and Information sheet).   
 
2. Describe the number and type of study visits and/or contacts between the study team and the participant , 
how long they will last, and where/how  they will take place.

3. Describe the expected duration of the study from the perspective of the individual participant and duration 
overall. 
 
The study duration is 3 years.  Phase 1 will be completed between 9/1/2014 and 12/31/2014.  From the perspective of individual participants the duration of phase 1, in the form of focus group meetings and individual i nterviews, will last between 1  – 1.5 ho urs.  
 
4. Provide a brief data analysis plan and a description of variables to be derived.  
 Phase 1 will identify the priorities of patients with type 2 diabetes.  This component will gather basic baseline information about demographic (age, gender) and disease characteristics (diagnosis of T2D given by a physician, time since diagnosis, severity of disease symptoms). Information gathered in phase 1 of the 
study will guide the formation of a national survey regarding the preferences and priorities of pati ents with 
type 2 diabetes. 
 
5. Describe whether you are collecting or storing personal identifiers, and if yes, why you need them, and 
when and how you plan to dispose of them.  Signatures on consent forms are considered to be identifiers.  
 
Personal identifie rs (in the form of first name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031])  will be stored in order to schedule 
focus group meetings. These identifiers will not be used during the focus group , will not be used in any data 
collection, and will be destroyed immediately after the  focus group.  
 
 
6.  Answer the following if they  are relevant  to your  study  design : 
 a.  If the study has different arms, explain the process for assigning participants (intervention/control, 
case/control), including the sequence and timing of the assignment.  
b. If human biospecimens (blood, urine, saliva, etc.) will be collected, provide details about who will collect the specimen, the volume (ml) and  frequency of collection, how the specimen  will be used, stored, 
identified, and disposed of when the study is over.  If specimens will be collected for use in future 
research (beyond this study), complete the Biospecimen Repository section below.  
c. If genetic/genomic analyses are planned , address  whether the data will be contributed to a GWAS or 
other large dataset.   Address returning unanticipated incidental genetic findings to study participants.  
d.  If clinical or laboratory work will be performed at JHU/JHH, provide the JH Biosafety Registrati on 
Number . 
e. If you will perform investigational or standard diagnostic laboratory tests  using human samples or data , 
clarify whether the tests are validated  and/or the lab is certified (for example is CLIA certified in the 
U.S.).   Explain the failure rat e and under what circumstances you will repeat a test.  For all human 
testing (biomedical, psychological, educational, etc.), clarify your plans for reporting test results to 
participants and/ or to their families or clinicians.  Address returning unanticip ated incidental findings to 
study participants.  
f. If your study involves medical, pharmaceutical or other therapeutic intervention, provide the following 
information: 
• Will the study staff be blind  to participant intervention status ? 
• Will participants rece ive standard care or have current therapy stopped?  
• Will you use a placebo or non-treatment group, and is that justifiable?

 VI. Data Custody, Security, and Confidentiality Protections  
The sections below describe types of data sources and how they will be protected. For the type(s) of data you will 
have, put an “X” in the appropriate box to the left of the section that best describes how you will minimize the risk of a breach of confiden tiality for your study.  Note, as appropriate, how you will record/store data.  These 
descriptions represent MINIMAL measures; you may add more stringent protections and other relevant information in B.  
Confidentiality:  The LOSS OR THEFT  of 1) original/duplicate version of physical data collection instruments (forms, 
tapes, etc) or 2) physical devices containing electronic data (i.e. laptop/mobile device, external flash drive(s), is a 
threat to subject confidentiality.   Risk of such a loss/theft is increased during movement/transport of data (in any 
format), such as in a vehicle or other move.   Be sure to train anyone (co -investigators, staff, students, etc.) who might 
be engaged in the oversight of data handling/storage about this problem.   Some typi[INVESTIGATOR_16288] -mitigation strategies 
would include : 
• minimizing the physical movement of data and/or devices containing data  
• encrypting electronic data (especially when stored on any mobile device, including flash memory tools, 
phones, tablets, etc, or when transferring across networks)  
• making use of reliable courier services (FedEx, DHL, etc) when physical transport of bulk data forms is 
necessary  
• minimizing the transfer of identifiable data in physical or electronic form (i.e. removing/separating/destroying 
identifiab le data, when physical transfer of data is necessary)

the self- management of their diabetes a bit distressing. There will be no questions about sensitive, personal or 
private topi[INVESTIGATOR_16294].   
 
B. Describe the anticipated frequency and severity of the harms associat ed with the risks identified above; for 
example, if you are performing “x” test/assessment, or dispensing “y” drug, how often do you expect an “anticipated” adverse reaction to occur in a study participant, and how severe do you expect that reaction to 
be?   
 
Distress about the topi[INVESTIGATOR_16295].  
 
C. Describe steps to be taken to minimize risks.  Include a description of your efforts to arrange for care  or referral  
for participants who may need it.  
 Focus group participants will be informed they needn’t answer any questions they don’t want to. Additionally, every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of participants during phase 1, including assigning 
identification numbers and the use of nicknames and first names in lieu of full names of participants.  
 
D. Describe the research burden for participants, including time, inconvenience, out -of pocket costs, etc.

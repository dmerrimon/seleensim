Title:  Development  of a Health -Related  Symptom  Index  for Spanish -
Speaking Persons  Diagnosed with and either  Treated  or Monitored 
for Anal  High -Grade  Squamous  Intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_366768]  (HSIL)  
Phase  of Study:  Observational  
Participating  Institutions:  This protocol  will be conducted  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  
Center  (MSKCC)  and will be open  for participant  referrals  to MSK  
from  participating  ANCHOR  sites . 
Accrual  Target:  Up to 40 participants  
Population:  Participants  who are Spanish -speaking  with limited  English  
proficiency  (LEP),  and who have  been  diagnosed  with HSIL  within  
the prior  nine months  will be recruited  for all phases  of ANCHOR  
HSIL  HRQoL  Index  (HQI)  development.  
Regimen:  Procedures  in this trial will be similar  to the AMC -A02 protocol  to 
validate  the HQI instrument  (anal  Health -Related  Symptom  Index, 
or aHRSI)  in the Spanish language , repeating  phases  4-6 (cognitive  
interviews)  with fluent  Spanish speakers . This study will employ a 
translation  of the current instrument  being studied in English-
speaking participants.  
• Cognitive Interviews in Spanish (Round 1): We plan to consent 
20 Spanish speaking participants in order to com plete 20 
cognitive interviews  for feedback on the initial Spanish-
language aHRSI d raft. 
• Cognitive Interviews in Spanish (Round 2): We  will recruit up 
to 10 parti cipants for this round with revised  items  tested  in a 
second  round  of cognitive  interviews  with a smaller  new cohort  
of HIV+  eligible  participants.  
• Cognitive Interviews in Spanish (Round 3): We  will recruit up 
to 10 participants for this round, if further refinements  to the 
Spanish- language  aHRSI  are indicated  from  the second round.  
Duration:  One interview  session  (approximately  45-60 minutes)  
Primary  Objective:  To develop  a Spanish -language  version  of the ANCHOR  HSIL  
HRQoL  Index (HQI) using state-of-the-art measure development  
methodology that captures  the most  important  HRQoL  symptoms  
and concerns  of those  persons  diagnosed  with anal HSIL  and either  
treated  or untreated  for anal HSIL.

AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   11 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  2.0 BACKGROUND 
2.1 Study  Disease  
Anal  cancer  is a growing  problem  in the United  States.  In the U.S.  general  population, the  
incidence of anal cancer  from  2006- 2010, was 1.5/100,000 among men and 1.9/100,000  
among women. Human  papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597]  (HPV)  infection  is causally  associated  with the 
development  of anal squamous -cell carcinoma.  Anal  HSILs  are also associated  with 
persi stent  HPV infection,  and HPV DNA has been  identified  in 35 to 61% of squamous  
neoplasms  of the anus, whereas  nonmalignant  anal epi[INVESTIGATOR_366770].  More  than [ADDRESS_458444]  been  detected,  of which  about  30 types  cause infection  of 
genital mucosal  sites.  These  are generally  characterized  as “high -risk”  types  (primarily  
HPV 16 and 18, but also 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, and 52), which  are associated  with low-
grade  squamous  intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184]  (LSILs),  HSILs,  and invasive  cancer.  
Compare d with the general  population, the standardized  incidence ratio (SIR)  of anal 
cancer  has increased  more  than 100-fold among some  risk groups  of HIV-infected  persons  
who are successfully  treated  with combination antiretroviral  therapy  (cART).  Among men 
in the general  population, the  incidence  is highest  among Black  men,  at 1.9/100,000.[ADDRESS_458445]  recent  data with actual  number  of cases  were  available from  
2009. There were 2,210 cases  of cancer  of the anus, anal canal,  and anorectum  among  
males  and 3,624 cases  among females.  There were  302 deaths  among males  and 516 among  
females  from  these cancers.  The incidence  of anal cancer  is largely  concentrated  among  
several  groups  well-known to be at increased  risk: men who have  sex with men (MSM)2; 
HIV-infected  men and women;  men and women  immunosuppressed for reasons  other  than 
HIV infection, including solid  organ transplant3,4; women  with a history of HPV- related 
cancer  or high- grade  squamous  intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184]  (HSIL)  elsewhere  in the anogenital  
tract;  and those  with a history of genital  warts.  Of all the groups  listed  above  the highest  
incidence of anal cancer  is among HIV-infected  men and women, particu larly MSM5,6. 
Overall  it is estimated  that the proportion of individuals  with anal cancer  who are also 
infected  with HIV increased  from  1980- 1984 to 2001- 2005, rising  from  1.1%  to 28.4%  
among males,  and from  0% to 1.2%  among females.  From  1980- 2005, the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_366771],  among whom  the incidence  
has been  increasing  annually  by 3.3%. 
However,  the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_366772] a strong impact  on the trends  in anal cancer  incidence  
among males,  with an annual  increase of 1.7%  among men without  HIV infection  and 3.4%  
among men with HIV infection. The risk of anal cancer  was elevated  52-fold in HIV-
infected  men who have  sex with men (MSM),  32-fold in HIV-infected  men,  and 24-fold in 
HIV-infected  women  compared  with  the general  population. 
Several  studies  show  an increase in the incidence of anal cancer  since cART  became  
available.  While  it is possible  that better  control  of HIV infection  with earlier  initiation  of 
cART  may moderate the increased  risk of anal cancer,  the long- term effect  of cART  on 
anal cancer  risk has not yet been  studied. Moreover, among HIV-infected  individuals, the 
great  majority  of people  currently  living  with HIV were begun on cART  later in the course  
of their HIV infection  than is currently  recommended. A recent  meta -analysis  estimated  
that 1 in 377 HIV-infected  MSM with anal HSIL  progress  every  year to anal cancer  since  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   12 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  the introduction of cART7, and since current  cART  has extended  the life spans  of HIV-
infected  individuals, this  may result  in a 10%  lifetime  risk of anal  cancer  or higher  among  
HIV-infected  MSM if  nothing is  done8. 
Taken  together, these data highlight  two important  points:  HIV-infected  men and women  
are disproportionately affected  by [CONTACT_241217],  and the impact  of HIV infection  on anal 
cancer  will likely  continue  to increase.  Second,  most  of the cases  of anal cancer  in terms  
of absolute  numbers  occur  among HIV-uninfected  men and women, and thus the results  of 
the ANCHOR  study (Anal  Cancer/HSIL  Outcomes  Research  Study;  AMC  #A01;  Joel 
Palefsky,  M.D., ANCHOR  PI, University  of [LOCATION_004],  San Francisco),  will impact  on 
both HIV-infected  and HIV-uninfected populations. In the absence of active intervention, 
the number  of cases  of anal cancer  will likely  continue  to grow  in the general  population  
in the U.S. with varying degrees  of contribution by [CONTACT_241218]-risk groups  described  above. Data  
on the global  incidence  of anal cancer  are not as reliable  but it is certain  that there are many  
thousands  more  cases  and deaths  from  anal cancer  each year worldwide. Combined with 
the possibility  that anal cancer  is preventable,  the incidence  of anal  cancer  is unacceptably  
high and  calls  for urgent  intervention. 
2.[ADDRESS_458446]  HSIL  (metachronous  lesions). Below  are described  the 
treatments  for HSIL.  
Ablative  treatments.  These  treatments  include  Infrared  coagulation (IRC),  an office -based  
procedure  using a therapeutic device  that delivers  short  pulses  of a narrow  beam  of visible  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   [ADDRESS_458447]  tip applicator applied  directly  to the target  tissue,  
transmitted  down the rigid  quartz glass  of the light guide. The tungsten- halogen  lamp  (150 
watts  of power) is the light source.  This light causes  thermal  coagulation, which  results  in 
tissue  necrosis.  The depth  of coagulation is determined  by [CONTACT_366805],  and depth of tissue  destruction is directly  proportional to the duration of infrared  
impulses.  The device is cleared  by [CONTACT_366806], tattoo  removal,  chronic rhinitis,  and anal condyloma. The 
procedure typi[INVESTIGATOR_366773] [ADDRESS_458448]-
procedure. The sequence  of events  is similar  to t hat  seen with cryosurgery: hemorrhagic 
blistering  and necrosis of the treatment site followed by a shallow erosion and ulcer,  and 
then healing  over several  week s. There is a small risk of infection  from  the procedure.  The 
risk of serious bleeding prompting emergency  room  evaluation  is <1%.  
Hyfrecation/electrocautery  is an ablative technique with a long history of use in the 
operating room and the office  for the t reatment  of HPV- associated  anal lesions. A recent  
publication showed no statistically  significant differences  between  electrocautery  and IRC  
in their efficacy  and safety  profile.  In the ANCHOR  study, clinicians  may use 
electrocautery  interchangeably  with IRC. The choice of therapy  typi[INVESTIGATOR_366774].  
Non-surgeons in the U.S. who treat anal HSIL  were primarily  trained  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Palefsky  and 
his group to use IRC,  but those with a surgical  background may prefer  electrocautery.  The 
main  advantages  of electrocautery  are that it is faster  than IRC to perform  and the 
electrocautery  probe tip can be more precisely  applied  to the lesion  than the IRC probe tip, 
which  is larger in diameter.  The main  disadvantage of electrocautery  is that it generates  a 
smoke plume, requiring a smoke evacuator  and mask  protection from  smoke for providers 
and patients  in the room. 
Other  a blative  treatments  include use of surgical  lasers.  These modalities  are less 
commonly used for anal HSIL,  but patients  treated  with these techniques will be eligible  
for the HRQoL  study. 
Treatment  unde r anesthesia (TUA)  is a procedure performed  by [CONTACT_366807][INVESTIGATOR_366775].  It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_366776]. Combined with post- procedural  IRC,  it has been  shown to be effective in 
treatment  of HSIL  for patients  with disease too widespread  to treat with targeted  ablation  
therapy9. TUA is  usually  required  for only a small percentage of  patients  being treated  for 
anal HSIL.  These  include 1) disease  that is so extensive that  it cannot be treated  by [CONTACT_366808],  or 2) if a lesion  is so large that it cannot be 
sufficiently  biopsied in the office  to establish  or exclude a diagnosis of cancer  to the 
satisfaction  of the clinician.  The disadvantage of TUA is that it is expensive compared  with 
the other methods. In addition, TUA is only done when  more  extensive excision  is required  
and patients  typi[INVESTIGATOR_366777]-procedure side effects,  including pain, 
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   14 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  bleeding, and infection  after TUA  when  compared  with less aggressive treatment  
modalities.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_366778].  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  5% fluorouracil cream  (5-FU) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_366779].  It is given with the intent to clear  as much of the lesion  
as possible, and while  it is unusual for a large  lesion  to clear completely,  it may be 
particularly  useful to “debulk” a lesion  to the point where it can them  be treated  with a 
targeted  ablative  approach such as IRC or electrocautery.  Among 20 patients  with 
extensive HSIL  who were  treated  with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  5-FU at UCSF  by [CONTACT_978]’s team,  complete  
response was seen in only 3 and no response was seen in one, but 16 had a significant 
decrease  in volume of disease to 25-50% that allowed  for in-office  IRC.  At UCSF,  the 
protocol for use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5- FU is for the patient  to apply intra-anal or perianal  5-FU twice  
daily  for [ADDRESS_458449] period. This cycle can  be repeated  eight times.  
Like 5 - FU, 5% imiquimod  cream  is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_366780] a targeted  ablative  modality  such as 
IRC or electrocautery.  Imiquimod  has been  used for treatment of external  genital  
condyloma since 1997. It is a synthetic  compound that exhibits antiviral activity  by [CONTACT_25764]-
regulating the immune  response, at least in part through toll-like receptors.  It may lead to 
a Th1 cytokine response that activates  HPV- specific cell-mediated  immunity  and clearance  
of lesions. Imiquimod  has been  used for treatment of HPV- associated  mucosal  disease  
including vulvar, penile , and anal  SIL.  The advantage of  imiquimod  is that,  like topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  5-
FU cream  it can be used to treat extensive disease  that is too large for targeted  ablation. It 
has a long safety  record  for treatment  of condyloma, including in the setting  of HIV 
infection . The disadvantages of imiquimod  are side effects  may be severe,  particularly  
when  patients  are experiencing a robust clinical  response. These may be local  irritation  or 
pain, or may be systemic  flu-like symptoms. Another disadvantage is that there are 
relatively  few randomized study data on the efficacy  of imiquimod  in treatment of perianal  
or anal disease.  Imiquimod has not been  studied formally  in the U. S.  The AMC  HPV 
Working Group was recently  approved by [CONTACT_366809]  a randomized  trial of 
imiquimod  vs. 5- FU vs. observation for extensive  HSIL  in HIV-infected  men and women. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_366781],  imiquimod  is on the list of treatment modalities  available to 
ANCHOR  study clinicians  but that may change pending the outcome of the AMC  study 
described  above or other study data as they become available.  The treatments  described  
above are used routinely by [CONTACT_366810].  Except  for TUA,  which  
is expected  to be necessary  for only a very small  percentage of participants  with HSIL,  
each is readily  available for use in the office  setting  by a wide  variety  of medical  
professionals, including physicians, nurse practitioners,  and physician assistants.  
Active  m onitoring or observation is the control arm of the ANCHOR  study, and this 
approach  is used clinically  in a small percentage of cases.  Given  the diversity  of treatments  
for anal HSIL,  it is important that the participant  sample  recruited  for the development of 
a symptom index measure include representatives  of all the treatment  modalities,  including 
those not treated  but actively  monitored. It is expected  that some participants  will have 
been  treated  with multiple  modalities; thus, these  participants  will be inclu ded in the 
HRQoL  study as  well.  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   15 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  2.3 Study  Design  and Rationale  
The ANCHOR  study  presents  a unique  opportunity for the measurement  of health -related  
quality  of life (HRQoL)  among those  diagnosed with HSIL,  as no measure currently  exists  
that captures  the symptoms  and related  experiences  of living  with or being treated  for 
HSIL.  HRQoL  is a “multi- domain concept  that represents  the participant’s  general  
perception  of the effect  of illness  and treatment  on physical, psychological, and social  
aspects  of life.”[ADDRESS_458450] the more  complex  subscale structure  of existing  HRQoL  
measures11. An index has the benefits  of being briefer  than existing  HRQoL  measures  (e.g.,  
< 20 items  vs. 40+ items)  more  focal,  quicker  to implement,  and is supported by 
[CONTACT_366811]. Cella’s  research  team12. The 
AMC -A02 study developed  a HRQoL  Symptom  Index  for HSIL  and its treatment  in the 
HIV-infected  population.18 This trial seeks  to develop a Spanish- language  version of the 
HRQoL  Symptom  Index , the anal Health -Related  Symptom  Index  (aHRSI),  among 
Spanish- speaking persons  with  limited  English proficiency  (LEP).  
There is  a paucity  of data  on symptoms  and concerns  of persons  diagnosed and treated  for 
anal HSIL.  In one prospective  study from  the ANCHOR  PI’s research  team13, a small  
sample  (n=37;  29 of whom  were HIV-positive ; mean  age of 45.8 years)  of persons  
diagnosed with HSIL  were  treated  with surgical  excision and followed  every  3-6 months  
for a mean  of 32 months. The primary  aim of the study was to demonstrate  the safety  and 
efficacy  of high- resolution anoscopy and surgical  treatment  for diagnosed HSIL.  A specific  
set of symptoms  and concerns  were  assessed:  Uncont rolled  pain, persistent  bleeding,  
perianal  abscess  formation,  late development  of anal stenosis,  and alteration  in anal 
continence  or sexual  function. Approximately  half of the patients  (16/29)  reported  
uncontrolled pain after the procedure  that lasted  for a mean  of 2.9 weeks  (range  1 to 120 
days). Most  of the pain experienced  was associated  with bowel  movements.  No patients  
required  reoperation  for abscess  or bleeding, or experienced  clinically  significant  stenosis  
or incontinence  to formed  stool. Twenty -four (83%) of  [ADDRESS_458451]  that HRQoL  concerns  
are substantial  after treatment for anal HSIL.  It is important  to assess physical  symptoms  
and concerns  in those  living  with or treated  for anal HSIL,  as these may be important  
considerations  in treatment decision -making for patients  and their physicians, especially  in 
the context  of an ANCHOR  finding of equivalent  effectiveness  of active treatment vs. 
activ e monitoring at  the trial’s  end.  
A second  study examined  psychological  symptoms  associated  with anal cancer  screening  
(high resolution anoscopy)  in [ADDRESS_458452] ized measures  of psychological  
distress at  four  time  points  during the  study:  time  1 (within  a week  before  the initial visit),  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   16 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  time 2 (within  a week  after the initial visit),  time 3 (within  a week  after receiving results),  
and time 4 (within  a week  before  the follow -up visit (usually at 6 months ). Only  a small 
proportion of the sample  (11%) was found to have  HSIL,  and these were treated  with either  
IFC or imiquimod.  The study found that being  screened  for precursors  of anal cancer  was 
not associated  with high levels  of adverse psychological  consequences  in most  patients.  
The time of greatest  negative  impact  was immediately  after having the screening  tests.  The 
proportion of patients  experiencing  higher  levels  of negative impact  tended to diminish  
over the four time points,  and the positive  effects  of being screened  seemed  to increase as 
time went  on. Younger  patients  and those  who had more  HIV symptoms  and higher  
psychological  distress scores  at baseline were  more  likely  to experience higher  levels  of 
negativ e psychological  impact  from  screening. There were  too few patients  with HSIL  to 
perform  meaningful  adjusted  analyses,  but there was a tendency  for such patients  to 
experience higher  levels  of negative  impact  just before  returning for follow -up, but not 
after receiving  their results.  The increased  stress may be a result  of the treatment  for HSIL,  
which  patients  would have received  between  times  [ADDRESS_458453]  also assess 
psychological  symptoms. 
In consultation with the AMC’s  expert  clinicians  who treat anal HSIL,  the research  team  
has learned  that not only modality  of treatment  can impact  peri- and post-treatment  
symptoms, but volume  of disease can as well.  A larger  volume  of disease may mean  a more  
intensive  treatment,  leading  to prolonged  or more  severe physical  and 
behavioral/psychological  symptoms. Thus, this study  will incorporate  low vs. high volume  
of disease,  defined  in the ANCHOR  Study protocol  as anal HSIL  that occupi[INVESTIGATOR_366782] 
50% or 50% or more  of the anal circumference,  as a parameter  of recruitment  of the 
participants  for this study in order  to assure  that both levels  of disease  volume  are 
represented.  
AMC -A02 aimed  to develop a symptoms  index (a more  focal  type of health -related  quality  
of life (HRQoL)  measure)  for persons  diagnosed  with,  and either  treated  or monitored for,  
anal high grade  squamous  intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_12184]  (HSIL).  Once developed, the measure will 
be implemented  within  the NCI-funded,  AIDS  Malignanc y Consortium's  ANCHOR  trial 
(AMC  #A01;  Anal  Cancer/HSIL  Outcomes  Research  Study;  Joel Palefsky,  M.D., PI, 
UCSF)  to confirm  validity  and reliability.18 In the ANCHOR  trial, persons  infected  with 
human immunodeficiency (HIV)  are the sample  population, as HIV-positive  persons  are at 
significantly  elevated  risk for HSIL  and anal cancer.  The primary  aim of the ANCHOR  
trial is  to determine  the effectiveness  of treating  anal  HSIL  to reduce the  incidence of  anal  
cancer  in HIV-infected  men and women. The ANCHOR  trial opened to accrual  in 
September  2014, and the NCI CTEP  review  has recommended  the development  of a 
HRQoL  measure appropriate to the ANCHOR  trial's  target  population and treatment  or 
active monitoring study arms.  No such measure  currently  exists;  hence,  it is important  to 
devise  such a measure,  especially  if the ANCHOR  trial supports  the effectiveness  of HSIL  
screening  and treatment in reducing the risk of anal cancer.  Given  the short  time frame  of 
funding made available to conduct  the measurement  developme nt, imminent ANCHOR  
recruitment,  and minimal risk from  study participation, the MSKCC  research  team  and 
recruitment  sites are dedicated  to assuring the privacy  of the non-MSKCC  participants  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   17 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  participating  in this study. 
To th is  end, we conducted a multi-pha se, methodologically rigorous, qualitative  data 
collection  and analysis  scheme involving: 1) Phase 1, Expert Consultation: Identification  
and listing  of important symptoms and concerns of HSIL  participants  from  the perspective 
of expert clinicians  within  the AIDS  Malignancy  Consortium (AMC);  consultation  with 
[CONTACT_366840],  author of the FAC IT HRQoL  measures,  regarding study methodology and 
use of existing  items  from  the FAC IT item bank that have been  validated  so as to assess  
domains identified  by [CONTACT_125726]; 2) Phase 2, Concept Elicitation: Independent 
elicitation  of important symptoms and concerns  from  eligible  HIV-positive participants  
referred  from  five ANCHOR/AMC  sites (Weill  Cornell Medical  College/NYPH;  
Montefiore Medical  Center;  Laser  Surgery  Care  Center ; UCSF  and the Anal  Dysplasia 
Clinic  Midwest ), as well as their responses to symptoms and concerns identified  by [CONTACT_366812];  3) P hase 3, Initial Measure  drafted  of an HRQoL  measure  
based  upon the expert  and partici pant feedback  from  Phases  1 and 2; 4) Phase 4: Cognitive 
interview  round 1 with a second  cohort of eligible  HIV-positive participants  for feedback  
on the initial HRQoL  Draft  from  Phase 3; 5) Phase  5: Cognitive interviewing  round 2 , 
w
ith revised  items  tested  in a second  round of cognitive interviews  with a smaller  new 
cohort of HIV -positive eligible  participants; and  6) Phase 6, Cognitive interviewing  round 
3, a final round of cognitive interviews  with a small  new cohort of HIV-positive  eligible  
participant s if further refinements  are indicated  from  the second  round.18 
This study adds a seventh  phase to the development paradigm conducted with protocol 
AMC -A02, which  will use the translated  aHRSI  in Spanish to complete  cognitive 
interviews  of Spanish- speaking  participants.  We will be conducting cognitive interviews  
(see Appendices  VI and VII) of the finalized  measure in Spanish ( see Appendices  XI and 
XII) to establish  the content validity  of the measure in Spanish. In addition to the cognitive 
interviews,  we will collect  a brief demographic form , and collect  information  on the 
participants  preferred  language and  language proficiency  (see Appendices IX, X, XIII , and 
XIV) for each participant.  We will enroll up to 40 eligible  HIV-positive participants  from  
participating  ANCHOR  sites using the same eligibility  criteria  as AMC -A02 phase 2 
(except  the age limit is lowered  to [ADDRESS_458454] 
language as per self-report) over three  rounds of cognitive interviewing , as was done for 
the English language version in  AMC -A02 phases  4-6.18 
• Cognitive Interviews  in Spanish (Round 1): The process  for conducting the cognitive 
interviews  will be the same  as for the English ones outlined above in  Phase 4. We will  
plan to consent 20 Spanish speaking participants  in order to complete  20 cognitive 
interviews.  
• Cognitive Interviews  in Spanish (Round 2): We will complete  Phase [ADDRESS_458455]  same method as we did for the English version if it is necessary.  If necessary,  
we will recruit  up to  10 participants  for this  Phase 5 round.  
• Cognitive Interviews  in Spanish (Round 3): We will complete  Phase [ADDRESS_458456]  same method as we did for the English version if it is necessary.  If necessary,  
we will recruit  up to  10 participants  for this  Phase 5 rou nd. 
  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   [ADDRESS_458457] been  diagnosed with HSIL  within  the prior  nine months  will be 
recruited  for all phases  of this protocol . The target  population is volunteers  who meet  all 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria , and who are presumed  eligible  for the ANCHOR  study.  
Recruiting  sites will be responsible  for referring  participants  into the HRQoL  Index  study 
who meet  the eligibility  criteria  listed  below . 
3.1 Eligibility  Criteria  
3.1.1 HIV-1 infection  
3.1.2 Age 18 years  or older. This age restriction  is intended to enrich  the study population 
at risk for cancer  since anal cancer  occurs  only rarely  under  this age even  among  
HIV-infected  individuals. Less than 1% of anal cancers  occur  under  the age of [ADDRESS_458458] nine months. If the 
participant’s  treatment  plan is “observation,”  the participant  must  have been  
diagnosed with  anal  HSIL  in the last nine  months. 
3.1.5 Life expectancy  of greater  than  5 years  
3.1.6 Fluent  in Spanish with  limited  English proficiency, per  self-report  
3.2 Exclusion  Criteria  
Participants  who do not fulfill the criteria  as listed  in Section  3.1 above,  are ineligible.  
Additionally , the presence of any of the following conditions  will exclude  a participant  
from  study enrollment: 
3.2.[ADDRESS_458459] e size 
This study will enroll  a minimum of  20 participants  and a maximum of  40 
participants.  
3.3.2 Accrual  rate 
Approximately 5 participants  per month. 
3.4 Participant  Referral  and  Enrollment  Procedures  
This study will be recruiting  from  any sites particip ating  in AMC -A01 as long as this 
protocol  is determined  to be exempt  by [CONTACT_366804]. Each  recruitment  site PI [INVESTIGATOR_366783].  Upon MSKCC  IRB approval, the 
exempt  protocol  will be provided to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_366784].  
Once each site’s  IRB approval  is obtained,  each site will be provided with instructions  on 
the referral  process  and a list of site-specific unique  identification  numbers  that will be 
used for each patient  referral.  Referring  sites will not collect  any data;  they will only be 
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   19 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  responsible for assuring eligibility  of all patient  referrals.  After  confirming a patient's 
eligibility,  the site physician or designee  will provide an Information  Sheet  about the study 
containing the MSK  RSA  contact  [CONTACT_3031],  financial  and transportation compensation 
information, and the unique identification  number. The Information  Sheet  will have a gray 
box on the top stating  “This  box for Clinician  Use Only. Clinician,  please circle  appropriate 
letter .” The appropriately circled  letters  will create the unique identification  number. It will 
be up to the patient  to initiate  a call to the MSK  RSA,  although one or more  sites may 
provide telephone access  within  their clinics  for referred  patients  to call the MSKCC 
contact.  The unique identification  number will have encoded  information  regarding from  
which  site the patient  has been  referred,  which  of four treatment  modalities  the patient  
used, and the volume of disease.  The encoding will not be interpretable  by [CONTACT_366813].  For example,  Laser  Surgery  Center  will be 
given Information  Sheets  with referral  numbers 100-199, Einstein  Montefiore  will be given 
Information  Sheets  with referral  numbers 200-299 and 400-499 ([CONTACT_16551]’s  clinic),  and 
Weill  Cornell will be given  Information  Sheets  with r eferral  numbers 300-399. Treatment  
modality  will then be indicated  by [CONTACT_366814].  
For example,  a participant who is being observed without treatment  will be represented  
with a circled  “O,” Ablative  with a circled  “A,” Topi[INVESTIGATOR_366785] a circled  “T,” and Surgery  
with a circled  “S.” If the patient  has undergone multiple  treatment  modalities,  the referral  
staff will select  the most recentl y received  treatment.  Next,  disease volume will be 
indicated  by [CONTACT_366815]  L or H.  L will correspond with  HSIL  lesion  size covering Less  
than or equal  to 50% of the anal canal/perianal  region and H will correspond with HSIL  
lesion  size covering Higher than 50% of the anal canal/perianal  region. An example code 
could then be 100- AL; this indicates  the patient  was referred  from  Laser  Surgery  Center,  
has received  ablative  treatment,  and has HSIL  lesion  covering less than 50% of the anal 
canal/perianal  region. It is important that the referral  site indicate  via the treatment  code 
how each patient  was treated,  and the volume of disease,  because patients  may not 
accurately  report treatment  modality.  The sampling strategy  must be monitored  by [CONTACT_366816] s taff in order to  assure  proper patient sampling. 
3.4.[ADDRESS_458460]  any data and they will only be responsible for assuring eligibility  of 
all participan t referrals.  
After  confirming  a participant's eligibility,  the site physician or designee will 
provide an Information  Sheet  (Appendices  I and II) about the study containing the 
MSK  RSA  contact  [CONTACT_366817].  
It will be up to the participant to initiate  a call to the MSK  RSA,  although one or 
more  sites may provide telephone access  within  their clinics  for referred  
particip ants to call  the MSKCC  contact.  
When  a referred  patient  calls the MSK  RSA  and expresses  interest  in participating  
in the study and all questions are answered,  the patient  will be asked  to provide the 
unique study ID and her/his name [CONTACT_41319](s) for the purpose of 
scheduling matters  only. The patient  will be offered  an appointment date/time  for 
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   20 
NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  the interview  to be held at MSK  or completed  over the phone. Once the scheduling 
is done but before  the date of the interview,  the RSA  will call the referring  site for 
that patient  to confirm  patient  eligibility  in cases  where the referred  patient  is not 
calling  directly  from  the referring  site clinic.  This is to assure  verbally  that the 
referred  patient  meets  the eligibility  requirements  and is the same  person r eferred  
by [CONTACT_366818].  
The MSKCC  screening  log for each participant will be destroyed once the 
participant  has completed  the interview,  declined  to participate  further,  or after 
three follow-up telephone calls when  a missed  or rescheduled  interview  
appointment occurs  for those participants  agreeing  to participate.  
3.4.2 Participant  visit procedures 
When  the patient  is seen or contact[CONTACT_366819],  the RSA  will 
review  the Information  Sheet  [see Appendi ces I and II] with the patient,  solicit  
questions, and ask for verbal  agreement  to participate  in the interview.  We will not 
collect  documented informed  consent in an effort  to maintain  the participant’s  
anonymity. If the patient  does not wish  to participate,  the session  will be ended , and 
no further contact  [CONTACT_366820].  If the patient  agrees  to 
participate,  then the RSA  will ask for gender identity,  age, education, and 
race/ethnicity  in order to be able to describe the sample  of patients  for this study. 
No name  [CONTACT_366835],  only 
the study- assigned  ID#. A digital audio recording  of the session  will commence 
once the interview  begins for the purpose of generating  a summary  report of the 
interview  by [CONTACT_366821].  These recordings will be destroyed within  48 business hours 
of the interview  and will only be examined  by [CONTACT_366822].  No transcripts  will be generated  from  the audio-recordings. The RSA  
notes and summary  will be identified  only with the unique identification  number of 
the referral.  No names,  telephone numbers, or ot her identifying information  will be 
associated  with  any study data.   
All patients  will be offered  $50 in  cash  or money order.   
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   [ADDRESS_458461] translate d the a HRSI  to Spanish  and will 
complete  cognitive interviews  in Spanish. We will be conducting cognitive interviews  (see 
Appendices VI and VII) of the finalized  measure  in Spanish ( see Appendices XI and XII) 
to establish  the content validity  of the measure  in Spanish. In addition to the cognitive 
interviews,  we will collect  a brief  demographic form  and collect  information  on the 
participants  preferred  language and  language proficiency  (see Appendices IX, X, XIII , and 
XIV) for each participant.  We will enroll  up to 40 eligible  HIV-positive participants from 
enrolling ANCHOR  sites . 
  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   [ADDRESS_458462]  involving survey measures  and cognitive  interviewing, no formal  
statistical analysis  plan is required. Respondents’  interviews  will be abstracted  and coded

is responsible  for compi[INVESTIGATOR_366786].  
  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   [ADDRESS_458464]  (IRB)  approval  and informed  consent  described  in the 
Department  of Health  and Human  Services  (DHHS)  regulations  for the Protection  of 
Human  Subjects  regulations  (45 CFR  Part 46). Each  participating  institution  will be 
required  to provide  written  confirmation  from  the IRB  of record  for this  exemption before  
initiating  participant  enrollment.  The sponsor’s  designee  (ANCHOR  DMC)  will maintain  
this record.  The IRB must  also approve  any significant  changes  to the protocol  and 
document ation  of this approval  must  be sent to the ANCHOR  DMC.  
Records  of all study review  and approval  documents  must  be kept on file by [CONTACT_366824]. The IRB  
should receive notification  of completion  of the study and final report  within  [ADDRESS_458465]  access  to these audio recordings. Audio recordings  will not be 
transcribed;  rather,  they will be referred  to when  drafting  the summary  report  of each 
participant  to ensure  accuracy  of the report.  Names  will not be used (only  a study  ID 
number). The recording  will be deleted  from  the server  within  48 business  hours  of its 
creation . Data collected  and created  on paper  (i.e., semi -structured  interviews  and summary  
reports) will also be saved  on the secure MSKCC  server  and only identified  through their 
ID number.  
The specific  health  data that will be collected  for this study includes  treatment modalities  
used and binary data on the extent  of anal HSIL.  Because it is important  to sample  
participant  experiences  across  the four treatment  modalities,  including  active monitoring,  
in a way proportional  to the treatment  practices  of clinician  experts  informing the study, 
we will record  the treatment modality  used  for each  participant's  anal  HSIL.   
PHI collected  will be limited  to name,  telephone  number s, and audio recordings  (voice  
print).  Once participant s have  been  referred  to the study by [CONTACT_366825],  we will ask for their name [CONTACT_366836]. The participant  
will be offered  an appointment  date/time  for the interview  to be held at MSK.  Once  the 
scheduling is done  but before  the date of the interview,  the study staff will call the referring  
site for that participant  to confirm  eligibility.  This is to assure  verbally  that the referred  
participant  meets  the eligibi lity requirements  and was referred  by [CONTACT_10867]. As sites will 
vary in their facilitation  of referrals,  no call will be made when  participant s are calling  
directly  from  the referring  clinic,  per prior arrangement  with the study staff.  The contact  
[CONTACT_3031] (name  [CONTACT_366837])  for each participant  will be destroyed  once the 
participant  has completed  the interview,  declined  to participate  further,  or after three

NCI Version  Date  08NOV2022  follow -up telephone  calls  when  a missed  or rescheduled  interview  appointment  occurs  for 
those participant s agreeing  to participate.  
This PHI will be stored  in the clinic’s  records  and will only be accessible to the following  
staff at MSKCC  until destruction:  Thomas  Atkinson, PhD; Yuelin  Li, PhD, Department  of 
Psychiatry  and Behavioral  Sciences,  Behavioral  Sciences  Service.   
Participant  PHI (name,  phone  number)  will only be retained  until the interview  has been  
completed  or the participant  has been  lost to follow -up due to non- response  to rescheduling  
the interview,  which  is [ADDRESS_458466]  documented informed  consent  as this could pose a 
threat  to the participants'  anonymity, which  we are trying to maintain.  Each  potential  
participant  will be referred  to this study by [CONTACT_366826]'s  clinical  staff.  It 
will be up to each potential  participant  to contact  [CONTACT_366827].  If they are 
interested,  MSK  study staff will ask for their name  [CONTACT_366838].  We will then contac t the referring  site to confirm  eligibility.  Once 
their participation  in the study is complete  we will destroy all contact  [CONTACT_366828]. If we 
collected  documented  infor med consent, we  could  not assure  each  participant of  this level 
of anonymity. 
This research  could not practicably  be conducted  without  a waiver  of HIPAA  authorization. 
Because HIV-positive  persons  are a vulnerable  population, we have  taken  great  care in 
protecting  their  privacy  while  assuring sound measure development  methodology. As  part 
of this protection, we will NOT  collect  documented informed  consent  as this could pose a 
threat  to participant's  anonymity, which  we are trying to maintain.  Each  potential  
participant  will be referred  to this study by [CONTACT_9682]. It will be up to each potential  
participant  to contact  [CONTACT_366827].  If they are interested,  MSK  study staff will 
ask for their name [CONTACT_366839].  We will 
then contact  [CONTACT_366829],  unless  other  arrangements  have  been  
made in advance,  such as calling  the participant  directly  from  the referring  clinic.  Once  
their participation  in the study is complete,  we will destroy all contact  [CONTACT_366830], after  which  each  participant  in the study will be  completely  anonymous.  
If we collected  documented  informed  consent, we could not assure  each participant  of this. 
The research  could not  practicably  be conducted without  access  to PHI because  the PHI is 
needed  to identify  eligibility  for the study. As part of the eligibility  criteria  for participation  
in the study, we need  HIV -positive  participant s being  treated  for HSIL.  We have designed  
a recruitment  method based  on referrals  from  site physicians  who will be well trained  in 
the eligibility  criteria.  This referral -based  recruitment  method is being used to protect  the 
potential  participants,  as PHI is needed  to determine  eligibility.  The PHI is also needed  to 
answer  the research  question, by [CONTACT_366831]’s  gender, age, ethnicity,  
education, and  HSIL  treatment modality.  
 
AMC  #A04 (Version  5.0) 08NOV2022   [ADDRESS_458467]  be validated  and will be done  so in the ANCHOR  
Study;  thus, there are no data to  be shared  until  the end of the ANCHOR  Study. 
The procedures  outlined above  in this minimal risk study offer comprehensive  protection  
of the privacy  of participants.  All resulting  qualitative  data (handwritten notes  and 
summaries)  will be completely  de-identified,  and all screening  logs will be destroyed so 
that no PHI is linked to the data.  Data collected  in the study will only be used and reported  
in the aggregate for the purpose  of describing the study sample  and devising items  that 
assess the symptoms  and concerns  related  to HSIL  diagnosis  and treatment.  Furthermore,  
none  of the information  collected  through interviews  presents  any risk to the participants.  
The final measure  resulting from  the above  process  will then be implemented  into the

Furthermore,  until study- specific records  containing PHI and are destroyed by [CONTACT_30588],  
those  records  will be maintained  in compliance  with existing  local  standards  for data 
security  and confidentiality to prevent  unauthorized access  to confidential  participant  
information. In accordance with the AMC’s  Certificate  of Confidentiality,  clinical  
information  will not be released  without  the written  permission  of the subject,  except  as 
necessary  for monitori ng by [CONTACT_366832]/AMC , the IRB,  the NCI,  the OHRP,  or 
designee.  
7.4 Study  Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_229345],  IRB,  NCI,  OHRP,  or other  
government  agencies  as part of their  duties  to ensure  that research  subjects  are protected.

This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_6812]-sponsored AIDS  Malignancy Consortium  
(AMC).  As part of their contractual  obligations, each participating  site within  the AMC

¿Cuál es el propósito de este estudio? 
El propósito de este estudio es desarrollar un cuestionario que pueda ser entendido por hispanohablantes, que mida 
los síntomas e inquietudes relacionados con la salud para las personas diagnosticadas con lesiones intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_366793] (en adelante HSIL según sus siglas en inglés), que han sido o tratada s o monitoreadas.  
¿Quién pude participar? 
Buscamos alrededor de 40 pacientes VIH+ que hayan sido tratados o monitoreados para HSIL anal y para quienes el 
español sea su primer idioma. Reclutaremos participantes de 14 centros de derivación aprobados por AN CHOR en 
los Estados Unidos. Debido a que el HSIL anal se trata por medio de métodos diferentes, buscamos participantes 
que estén recibiendo cada método de tratamiento.  
¿Qué debo hacer como participante en este estudio?  
Si desea ser parte del estudio, usted participará en una entrevista privada e individual por teléfono o en persona que 
durará aproximadamente 60- [ADDRESS_458478] (Calle 54).

Introduction (Read to Participant)  
 
• It is important to understand the experiences of people who are diagnosed with Anal HSIL 
(pre-cancer lesion in the anus) (and any treatments they receive – IF APPLICABLE). That is 
why we are asking for your help today. We would like you to answer some questions for the 
next hour. We will be asking you to use some of the new questions we are developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and then to tell us your experiences answering these questions, such as how easy or difficult the questions were to answer. Some of these questions will ask you about your symptoms related 
to Anal HSIL (and treatment – IF APPLICABLE). Some questions will ask about how Anal 
HSIL (and treatment – IF APPLICABLE) has impacted parts of your everyday life. With your 
help, we will be able to have a better understanding of what people who have Anal HSIL are 
experiencing.  
• The information that you provide today will be used for research purposes, and will help 
people in the future.

Now let’s go back and discuss any of those areas where you indicated that the statement was hard to understand.  Putting aside issues that you have already told me about, what were the issues or problems that came up for you in those places?    (Some of the issues raised during this portion may probe specific issues that we are targeting, please make note of these to work toward not repeating these issues again in the interview)  Cognitive Interviewing Probes – Instructions

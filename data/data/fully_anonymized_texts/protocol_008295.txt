Interviews of NH administrators and staff who participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_437456] a process evaluation will be used to identify and develop supports for implementation and sustainability in preparation for future CHATO testing. 2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus The population afflicted with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias will expand from 5 to 16 million by 2050, increasing dementia care costs from $259 billion to $1.1 trillion.1 Of today’s 1.4 million nursing home (NH) residents, 61% have moderate to severe dementia, and up to 90% of them exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) such as physical and verbal aggression, agitation, and wandering.2-4 These behaviors are associated with depression as well as reduced quality of life and lower survival rates in persons with dementia (PWD).3  BPSD also stress family caregivers and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_437457].5,6  In the NH, BPSD increase time to provide care, and NH staff, primarily Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) who provide most direct care, report that BPSD represent the most stressful aspect of their job.7-9 Considering additional costs for CNA burnout and turnover, It is estimated that  BPSD increase costs of dementia care by 25 to 35%.10  With national NH rates for a semi-private room of $82,[ADDRESS_554333] up to $20,000 per resident annually.11   As cognitive and communication abilities decline due to dementia, NH residents become unable to convey care preferences and needs and staff communication becomes infantilizing, impersonal, and task-oriented resulting in BPSD. As verified in our research using behavioral coding and sequential analyses of video-recorded care, staff elderspeak (communication that sounds like baby [CONTACT_225155]) is linked to resident resistiveness to care (RTC), a subset of BPSD that disrupt nursing care. In our study, NH residents were more than twice as likely to be resistive to care when staff used elderspeak compared to normal communication.[ADDRESS_554334], despi[INVESTIGATOR_437458],23 an FDA black box warning of increased mortality for older adults with dementia,21 and a recent Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) mandate to reduce off-label prescribing of antipsychotics.24 CMS and the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care target reductions in psychotropic drug use as top priority.25 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_437459] (one type of psychotropic medication) ranging from 3 to 12% from 2011-2016, up to 20% of NH residents received inappropriate antipsychotic medication in 2017.[ADDRESS_554335] care providers in behavioral interventions to control BPSD also reduces psychotropic drug use (antipsychotics, hypnotics, antidepressants, antianxiety, sedative, anticonvulsant and mood stabilizers),27-29 although evidence is limited by [CONTACT_437486].27   Our recently completed R01 clinical trial that tested Changing Talk (CHAT) communication training (NR011455) provides preliminary data for the proposed research. CHAT decreased staff elderspeak that reduced resident RTC.30 On average, elderspeak declined from 34.6% (SD = 18.7) at baseline by 13.6 percentage points (SD = 20.00) post-intervention and 12.2 percentage points (SD=22.0) after 3 months (see Figure 1). RTC declined from 35.7% (SD = 23.2) by 15.3 percentage points (SD = 32.4) post-intervention and 13.4 percentage points (SD=33.7) at follow-up. Linear mixed modeling determined that change in elderspeak was predicted by [CONTACT_437487] (b = -12.20, p = .028) and baseline elderspeak (b = -0.65, p < .001), while RTC change was predicted by [CONTACT_437488] (b = 0.43, p < .001), baseline RTC (b = -0.58, p < .001), resident communication disability, and comorbid illnesses.                        Figure 1. CHAT effects on elderspeak & RTC.  CHAT increases staff awareness of elderspeak’s negative effects and guides practice of more effective communication. CHAT includes three, hour-long sessions, with replicated effects on communication in three studies among staff (N=89) and residents (N=194) in over [ADDRESS_554336] sizes ranged from η2 = .35 to .62 for reducing elderspeak diminutives (inappropriately intimate terms of endearment) and collective “we” pronoun substitutions; effects were maintained 

      5 over 2 months. Person-centered (vs task-focused) communication also increased.30,[ADDRESS_554337] participants (N=217); mean program ratings ranged from 4.5 to 4.8 on a 1(low) to 5 (high) scale.[ADDRESS_554338] of CHAT on psychotropic medication use, we extracted CMS NHQM data for use of antipsychotics for the 10 CHAT NHs for which data were available. We compared each NH’s rates for two quarters before and two quarters after each participated in CHAT. The percentage of residents prescribed antipsychotics decreased by [CONTACT_5554] 4.9 percentage points, from 20.7% (SD=8.5) to 15.8% (SD=9.0) after CHAT. We used state average rates of antipsychotic medication use for the same time periods to control for changes that may have occurred due to the CMS mandate and other factors.47 The state benchmark for prescribed antipsychotics averaged 25.4% across quarters before and declined to 24.9% for quarters after CHAT, a decrease of 0.5%. The average decrease in CHAT NHs (4.9%) compared to the other state NHs (0.5%) was significant (p=0.[ADDRESS_554339]).48  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_437460], we found challenges to educating NH staff that limited participation in CHAT including turnover, absenteeism, heavy workloads, and personal conflicts.35,36 37 Each CHAT session was held multiple days and times. Still, as few as 44% of staff in one NH completed at least two of the three sessions,[ADDRESS_554340] evaluated online web conference training with multiple NHs as an alternative format for increasing access and dissemination.41 However, engagement of individual staff was limited with this approach. To facilitate dissemination, online CHAT modules (CHATO) were developed to provide the same CHAT content with asynchronous and independent access for busy NH staff.[ADDRESS_554341] problem communication in the transcript, type their improved communication, and compare it to suggested corrections. Moderated online discussions are included in the modules that are supported on Training-Source.org, a free and publicly available learning portal.  IT functionality and content equivalency of the newly developed CHATO online modules was demonstrated by a convenient university-affiliated sample of nurses, CNAs, and students (N=9) with NH experience. They rated the online modules at 4.7 to 5.0 on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree) for increasing their knowledge, usefulness, clarity, and satisfaction. CHATO was rated as easy by 57%, while 43% found it somewhat challenging but not too difficult.  All reported moderate to great improvement in recognizing and understanding ineffective communication and developi[INVESTIGATOR_437461].[ADDRESS_554342] scores improved from M = 82.4% (SD 10.62) to M = 91.21% (SD 8.22). Effect sizes for pre-post changes for identifying ineffective, appropriate, and person-centered communication in a video clip were greater for CHATO participants compared to past CHAT participants (N = 217).34,[ADDRESS_554343] the effects of improved staff communication (from CHATO) on resident BPSD, using available clinical Minimum Data Set (MDS) data. Effects on psychotropic medication use, measured by [CONTACT_437489] (NHQM) data, will also be evaluated. This research will address the gap in rigorous trials testing nonpharmacological interventions to decrease BPSD that also identify strategies to improve intervention dissemination.27The goal is to increase access to CHATO training, as a tool to reduce BPSD and inappropriate psychotropic medication use to improve dementia care.  3 STUDY DESIGN The R61 will prepare for the R01 pragmatic trial by [CONTACT_437484]. The research design is a randomized clinical trial. One NH will provide initial feasibility testing.  Any modifications to the modules will be made. Then 6 nursing homes (estimated N=150 staff) will be randomly assigned to intervention or wait-list control groups. The primary outcome will be knowledge gain for staff completing CHATO training. Additional outcomes include resident quality measures related to behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) on both resident and facility levels and facility level data related to inappropriate use of psychotropic medications to control BPSD.  Staff Knowledge Gain. At time 1, nursing home staff in both groups will complete baseline pre-tests of knowledge and rating of communication. The immediate intervention group will then complete the online CHATO modules within a one-month period.  This includes assessments of post-test knowledge, communication rating, program evaluation, and diffusion of innovation surveys at Time 2. Also, at Time 2, the wait-list control group will repeat the pre-tests of knowledge and communication rating and will then complete the CHATO online module training over a one-month period, followed by [CONTACT_91241] [ADDRESS_554344] control groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training. Changes in knowledge from Time 1 (baseline) to Time [ADDRESS_554345] groups using model estimates obtained with a linear mixed model (LMM) approach to account for repeated measures and clustering within nursing homes.  Next, pre- to post-training changes in knowledge will be combined for immediate and wait-list groups and also tested using LMM approach. The models will be adjusted for covariates, such as staff role (RN, LPN, CNA, other), experience, and whether the nursing home has a SCU or not.   TABLE 1.

Resident outcomes data will be compared between the intervention and wait-list control groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training. Seven months of data will be plotted to examine changes in nursing homes and resident outcomes.   Implementation Strategies and Process Evaluation. An Implementation Toolkit for NHs and a CHATO Training Manual (See Appendices) have been created to provide support and implementation suggestions to pi[INVESTIGATOR_437462]. Several consultants provided feedback and additional resources to be included in these materials. Each NH will be given a three-month period to complete the CHATO training. One month for orientation, team development, and planning, one month to complete the three-week training, and one month for staff recognition and follow up. The CHATO Research Team will meet with the NH leadership at the beginning and end of this three-month period, manage CHATO training virtual discussion board, and provide technical assistance as necessary. The process evaluation includes an online implementation survey (See Appendices) which identifies the strategies NHs used to implement the training and includes the Artifacts of Culture survey. The survey uses the Diffusion of Innovation framework and mirrors the Implementation Toolkit. Additional process evaluation activities include: Leadership phone interviews completed by [CONTACT_437490]-ended questions asked of direct care staff in the CHATO virtual discussion.  TABLE 2.

      [ADDRESS_554350] already been screened for eligibility and/or ineligibility. Letters of agreement will be collected from each NH as well as executive leaders from Presby[CONTACT_437493]. All staff at these sites will be invited to participate and will read and accept an exempt statement prior to taking the CHATO training.  [ADDRESS_554351] Internet module adaptation of the CHAT program, developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_437465]. Standards for online education were used to transition to the module format. CHAT(and CHATO) have interchangeable content and are conceptually based on the Communication Predicament of Aging 16 that describes how stereotypes of older adults as incompetent prompt younger persons (NH staff) to alter their communication with older adults (NH residents). The exaggerated simplification and clarification strategies of elderspeak result in speech that sounds like baby [CONTACT_437494], contributing to isolation, depression, assumption of dependency, and BPSD.16,62 CHATO alerts NH staff to elderspeak and its negative effects, involves them in taking the older adult’s perspective, and guides self-evaluation and practice of effective communication.[ADDRESS_554352] three modules. Both CHAT and CHATO target adult learners using applied strategies tailored to improve specific aspects of elderspeak that are described in the literature and are modifiable. Limiting content and complexity minimizes burden to staff and their NH employers and increases the likelihood of skill enactment.64  CHAT was developed step-wise and iteratively through the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development.65 Early Stage 1 development led to Stage III testing of CHAT in controlled NH (community) settings to establish efficacy.  After additional Stage I modification of the original CHAT content to online module format, CHATO is now positioned for effectiveness testing (Stage IV) with NH (community) providers to maximize external validity in preparation for future Implementation and Dissemination research (Stage V).66 The CHATO program is presented in three modules.37,63 Session 1 introduces effective versus ineffective communication. Participants identify communication issues in video vignettes. Session 2 focuses on identification and negative effects of elderspeak, using video-recorded 
      9 examples. Session 3 includes strategies for improved communication based on assessment of each resident’s abilities. Participants critique communication in videos and correct transcripts to eliminate elderspeak. Training is limited to three, 1-hour sessions to assure feasibility in busy NHs. The modules include interactive exercises that must be successfully completed to advance through the program, assuring delivery of content fidelity and dose of the intervention. CHATO is provided to as many staff as possible to achieve facility-wide effects of reduced elderspeak.[ADDRESS_554353] three months to complete all three modules. The modules contain pre and posttests (scenario-based questions and rating of staff communication in video clips) to evaluate knowledge gain from CHATO. The Modified Duke Diffusion of Innovation58 survey provides information about CHATO participant intentions to use learned skills in practice and the likelihood for translation.  During the R61, the instructional designer will assure that data for identifying each participant’s NH and metrics including time spent in each module are collected for analyses.34,37 5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  The study intervention is the Changing Talk Online (CHATO) training. The goal of course is to increase awareness of the importance of effective communication with older adults and to use evidence-based person-centered communication during interactions with older adults in nursing homes and other health care settings. The course is designed for staff in nursing homes, independent and assistive living, and health care settings in the community that include registered nurses, nursing assistants, nursing home dieticians, direct care professionals, other administrations and support employees. The total program is approximately 3 hours, split into 3 modules. Each module is approximately an hour, depending on the individual user. Upon completion of all three modules and 70% on a posttest, a certificate of completion ([ADDRESS_554354] hours) will be awarded.  Treatment 1:  CHATO Training Module 1 This module contains information on the importance, benefits, and components of effective communication. This module covers the overarching goals and objectives, the benefits and components of effective communication, communication challenges of aging, and identification of effective communication (Videos).  Learning Outcomes • Recognize the importance of communication to older adults. • Identify barriers to communication in care of older adults. • Distinguish between effective and ineffective communication strategies  Treatment 2:  CHATO Training Module 2 This module contains information on common communication barriers and challenges, elderspeak communication, and effective and ineffective communication strategies.  It reviews benefits and components of effective communication and introduces Elizabeth Layton paintings and thought exercises. The module also covers communication barriers and nursing home communication, ignoring talk vs. task talk vs. interpersonal talk, the Communication Predicament Model and elderspeak, and the identification of elderspeak and ineffective strategies (Videos).  Learning Outcomes • Identify elderspeak and its potential negative messages. 
      10 • Contrast effective and ineffective communication strategies. • Revise transcripts to reduce elderspeak and ineffective communication.  Treatment 3:  CHATO Training Module 3 This module contains information on common problems during communication, guidelines for improving communication, and characteristics of person-centered communication. The modules review nursing home communication, ineffective strategies, and elderspeak and discusses the Communication Enhancement Model. Affirming and effective communication and evaluating communication are practiced (Videos and Rewriting of Scripts).  Learning Outcomes • Identify affirming communication. • Critique communication in video recordings of nursing home staff-resident communication. • Rewrite transcripts to reduce elderspeak and ineffective communication. The course content is presented by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kristine Williams, RN, PhD. There are learning activities, discussion forums, list of resources, pre and posttests, and evaluations at the end of the course. The practice activities were designed to provide opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills presented in the course and a virtual discussion forum is available to share experiences and reflect with others. 5.3 Concomitant Interventions NHs will agree not to participate in other communication education programs during study involvement. Monitoring and technical assistance will be provided to each study site to ensure adherence. 5.4 Adherence Assessment  Monitoring of user statistics including: staff demographics, time spent in the modules, completion rate and program evaluation will be done by [CONTACT_437495]. Technical assistance including CHATO discussion boards will be provided by [CONTACT_437496].

Accordingly, all data will be handled as confidential by [CONTACT_437501], not including names, from the point of archiving through data analyses. The original data files and file linking data identification codes to participants will be stored in locked secure files or on secure KUMC servers. Data access will be controlled by [CONTACT_316923].  7.[ADDRESS_554361] (DSMB) will provide oversight to assure the safety of participants and integrity of the data. The members of the DSMB include a team of interdisciplinary professionals who are not a part of the research team. The DSMB members includes clinical and research experts on NH dementia care and NH staff education as well as a statistician.   The DSMB will meet twice yearly and additionally if needed at the request of the PI (due to issues arising in study conduct or major changes in study protocols). The DSMB will review reports of the research team concerning data quality and timeliness, adherence to study protocols, participant recruitment and accrual, and consenting procedures.  The research team (under the direction of the PI) will report accrual, retention figures, and all adverse and other events and outcomes.   The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety daily and will monitor participant safety, evaluate progress of the study, and assure confidentiality, data management, and analysis. This includes continuous active review of research activities that will be completed with assistance of the Project Director (PD).      The PI [INVESTIGATOR_437469] (including minutes of annual and any additional DSMB meetings) to the funder. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_437470] a) any unanticipated problems or unexpected adverse or serious adverse events that are determined to be related to the study protocol, b) IRB-approved revisions to the study protocol that indicate a change in risk for participants, c) a summary of recommendations made by [CONTACT_437502], and d) notice of any actions taken by [CONTACT_437503].   To assure data control and safety for participants, each research team member will be trained and supervised by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or PD, including instruction in all research activities, data handling, and in reporting subject complaints or other behaviors indicating a negative response to participation in the study immediately to the PI. Research team staff will be supervised during direct interactions with research study participants and provided with feedback.    All data identifiers will be removed for secured computer storage; a code will be assigned to each subject for data storage and the key linking the code number to subject identification will be kept secure by [CONTACT_358865]. All data will be deidentified prior to dissemination outside the research team.  7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  The OHRP Unanticipated Problem and AE Guidance definitions will be used for this study. Adverse Events (AE) will be documented on the Adverse Event Form and unanticipated events that are not adverse events will be recorded on the Unanticipated Problem form. Adverse events and unanticipated problems (Ups) will be reported to the IRB, DSMB and NIH Program Officer 
      15 as required. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_437471], whether it was expected or unexpected, and will determine relationship to participation in the study.  A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) occurs when an unanticipated event which may result in death, life threatening or places participant at risk of death, requires of prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or otherwise is judged to represent a significant hazard. SAE are not expected in this minimal risk exempt pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], however, the Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis and will monitor participant safety. 7.4 Reporting Procedures When SAEs occur that are unanticipated and are related to the intervention, they will be reported to the NIA Program Officer and to the DSMB Chair or designee, within 48 hours of the research team’s knowledge.   Ups involving risks to study participants or others will be reported to the NIA program officer within 48 hours unless they are also SAEs  7.5 Follow-up for Adverse Events A summary of all SAEs will be reported to the NIA Program Officer and to the DSMB quarterly.    7.6 Safety Monitoring The DSMB will initially review and approve the written study protocol; data collection and storage protocols, intervention materials, informed consent procedures, and the plan for data and safety monitoring. Any outside agreements with vendors and subcontractors will be reviewed.  The DSMB will also review the general reporting guidelines based on the study procedures approved by [CONTACT_1744]. Reporting rules will be established taking into consideration the population under study and anticipated adverse outcomes (reflected in the human subjects’ consent documents).   The DSMB will meet twice annually, either in-person or by [CONTACT_31523], data quality, and participants safety. Safety reports are sent to the SO if necessary twice a year and will include a detailed analysis of study progress, data and safety issues. The content of the data and safety monitoring report will include: (e.g., study status, participant descriptive information, safety information, study quality). Blinded reports will be produced for open sessions and unblinded reports for closed sessions. 8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  This is a low risk study consisting of pi[INVESTIGATOR_437472]. Thus, it is difficult to anticipate specific, a-priori stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. If the research team, IRB, NIA program officer, and/or DSMB identify a pattern to these events, an interim analysis of safety data will be conducted to inform a decision for premature stoppage of study. Since this is a low-risk, short (six-month) pi[INVESTIGATOR_437473], no interim analyses on the primary study outcomes are planned. 
      16 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  9.1 General Design and Outcomes  Primary Objective  AIM 1. Establish acceptability and preliminary efficacy of online CHATO modules through pi[INVESTIGATOR_437454].  Staff Outcomes: Knowledge gain and communication rating data will be compared between the intervention and wait-list control groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training.  Resident Outcomes: The BPSD and medication reports will be provided for the one-month period before baseline data collection and for each month thereafter until the post-training assessment of the wait-listed nursing homes is completed (a total of seven months for both groups). Resident outcomes data will be compared between the intervention and wait-list control groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training.   Secondary Objectives  AIM 2. Develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_437474]. Interviews of NH administrators and staff who participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_437456] a process evaluation will be used to identify and develop supports for implementation and sustainability in preparation for future CHATO testing.   Implementation Outcomes: We will analyze NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (approach, motivation, incentives). Strategies will be described, categorized, and correlated with participation rates. A survey for CHATO group NHs, will describe how CHATO was implemented and concurrent activities that may have influenced BPSD and psychotropic use rates. The Artifacts of Culture Change Tool will describe the NH care environment and practices, leadership and workplace practices, staffing outcomes, and occupancy.[ADDRESS_554362]-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for the cost associated with hypothesized BPSD reductions will be calculated. 9.[ADDRESS_554363] controls using a random number generator.  We estimate a CHATO training sample size of 150 participants.  9.3 Interim analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_437475] a low risk study consisting of pi[INVESTIGATOR_437472]. Thus, it is difficult to anticipate specific, a-priori stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. If the research team, IRB, NIA program officer, and/or DSMB identify a pattern to these events, an interim analysis of safety data will be conducted to inform a decision for premature stoppage of study. Since this is a low-risk pi[INVESTIGATOR_437473], no interim analyses on the primary study outcomes are planned. 9.[ADDRESS_554364] control groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training. Changes in knowledge from Time 1 (baseline) to Time 2 will be compared between immediate and wait-listed groups using model estimates obtained with a linear mixed model (LMM) approach to account for repeated measures and clustering within nursing homes. Next, pre- to post-training changes in knowledge will be combined for immediate and wait-list groups and also tested using LMM approach. The models will be adjusted for covariates, such as staff role (RN, LPN, CNA, other), experience, and whether the nursing home has a SCU or not. Distributions of residuals will be evaluated for normality and variance homogeneity and variables will be transformed as needed or statistical analyses for non-normal data will be utilized.  The BPSD and medication reports will be provided for the one-month period before baseline data collection and for each month thereafter until the post-training assessment of the wait-listed nursing homes is completed (a total of seven months for both groups). Resident outcomes data will be compared between the intervention and wait-list control groups and within nursing homes before and after the CHATO training. Seven months of data will be plotted to examine changes in nursing homes and resident outcomes.   We will analyze NH strategies used to engage staff in CHATO (approach, motivation, incentives). Strategies will be described, categorized, and correlated with participation rates. A survey for CHATO group NHs, will describe how CHATO was implemented and concurrent activities that may have influenced BPSD and psychotropic use rates. The Artifacts of Culture Change Tool will describe the NH care environment and practices, leadership and workplace practices, staffing outcomes, and occupancy.[ADDRESS_554365]-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for the cost associated with hypothesized BPSD reductions will be calculated.  Scores for each engagement strategy category will be calculated, summarized using means and standard deviations, and correlated with participation rates. Strategy categories (approach, motivation, incentives) will be summarized using frequencies and percentages and examined in relation to participation rates using ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on the distribution of participation rates. Participation rates will be calculated using data from the NHs (eligible staff) and from the modules (CHATO participants). Data describing CHATO participant time spent on each module and completion rates, all collected by [CONTACT_437504], will also be analyzed. We will also evaluate NH attrition and within-NH dropout/completion rates for CHATO participants. We will also evaluate CEA differences for the three typi[INVESTIGATOR_437476].[ADDRESS_554366]. She will serve as the data coordinator for the study.

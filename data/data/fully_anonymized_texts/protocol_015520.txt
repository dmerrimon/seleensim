1.4.     * Abstract: Provide a simple explanation of the study and briefly address (in 1 to 2 sentences) each of the 
following points: rationale; intervention; objectives or purpose; study population or sample characteristics; 
study methodology; description of study arms (if appropriate); study endpoints or outcomes; follow -up; 
statistics and plans for analysis.  
Chronic pain affects over 100 million adults in the US, resulting in disability, loss of work productivity, and overall 
reductions in health, making chronic pain a major public health problem with an economic burden estimated at $[ADDRESS_1270569] frequently prescribed class of drugs to control pain, lack evidence supporting their 
long-term efficacy and carry a 15 -26% risk of misuse and abuse among pain patients, highlighting a critical need to 
develop effective non -pharmacological  interventions for pain. Guided imagery (GI), a cognitive -behavioral technique for 
guiding patients to create multisensory, imagined scenes to increase well -being, is an effective non -pharmacological 
intervention for reducing pain. However, its effectivene ss is limited by [CONTACT_1962] � imaging abilities. The long -term objective 
of this project is to reduce chronic pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_905109] -home virtual reality (VR) -GI intervention to 
improve chronic pain management using the Limbix VR Kit. Given t he enhanced immersiveness and interactivity of VR, 
VR-GI is expected to reduce pain and reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], as well as improve functional outcomes and mood, compared 
to traditional audio -only GI and usual care. Specific aims of this Phase I application ar e to: 1) develop and add VR -GI 
intervention prototypes for chronic pain management to the existing Limbix VR platform, and 2) evaluate feasibility and 
usability of an at -home VR -GI intervention in a 2 -week clinical trial and prepare for a larger subsequent  clinical trial. Two 
15-min VR -GI experiences that guide patients through psychoeducation, relaxation exercises, and interactive virtual 
worlds that allow them to control their experience of pain will be created and added to the Limbix VR platform for the 
intervention. To assess feasibility of an at -home VR -GI intervention, 36 patients with chronic pain (chronic back pain, 
CBP or complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS) will complete a 2 -week intervention with at -home daily practice of VR -GI 
(n = 24) or audio -only GI (n = 12). Pre -post treatment measures of pain intensity, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], functional outcomes, and 
mood will be collected. Intervention feasibility and patient satisfaction will be evaluated post -treatment via questionnaire 
and qualitative interview. Ba sed on Phase I results, a Phase II randomized clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy of VR -GI 
in reducing pain and reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_905110]/or CRPS patients. This research directly addresses the need to 
improve pain treatment to prevent opi[INVESTIGATOR_218294].

Children and adolescents under 18 years of age will not be included as this study is specifically designed to 
address adult chronic pain. Changes to the intervention design beyond the scope of the present study would be 
warranted for children and adolescen ts due to cognitive and developmental differences between children and 
adults. These differences preclude the applicability of the proposed intervention to children. A separate, age -
specific study on virtual reality (VR) guided imagery for c hronic pain in patients under 18 years old is preferable 
to their inclusion in the present study. Additionally, the long -term effects of extended VR exposure on children 
and adolescents are largely unknown and thus these groups are excluded from the presen t study to mitigate 
possible risks.  
    
 
    
 
  11. Research Objectives and Background    
  11.1.  Describe the specific objectives or aims of the study and hypotheses or research questions.  (Refer to specific 
sections of the protocol/grant, if applicable ) 
Specific Aim 1. Develop and add VR -GI prototypes for chronic pain management to the existing Limbix VR platform. VR -
GI prototype development will involve creating narrative scripts and audiovisual content. VR -GI experiences will guide 
patients through pain  management education and relaxation exercises within interactive virtual environments that allow 
them to control their experience of pain. A protocol for the VR -GI intervention will also be created. SA1 Milestone: 
Completion  and addition of two 15 -minute VR -GI prototypes and a VR -GI intervention protocol to the Limbix VR platform.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility and usability of at -home VR -GI intervention in a 2 -week clinical trial and prepare for 
larger subsequent clin ical trial. 36 patients (chronic back pain or complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS) will be 
recruited to complete 1 -2 online clinic training sessions followed by 2 weeks of daily at - home VR -GI (n = 24) or 
traditional audio -only GI (n = 12) practice. Inter vention feasibility will be evaluated via questionnaires and via informal 
interviews with providers. Pre - and post -intervention measures of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], pain ratings, functional outcomes, mood, 
and quality of life will be collected. Daily pre - and post -GI practice pain ratings will be collected to evaluate potential 
habituation effects of VR -GI over time. SA3 Milestone: Using a confidence interval approach, demonstrate that the VR -GI   
 
intervention is feasible, defined as meeting an 80% threshold for feasibility metrics (i.e., enrollment feasibility, 
intervention tolerability, and compliance). Efficacy, defined as a 30% reduction in pain ratings and standardized effect 
sizes between 0.3 - .05 on opi[INVESTIGATOR_905122], will also be evaluated to prepare for a Phase II 
clinical trial.  
  
  11.2.  Provide a summary of the background of the study, and  explain how this research will contribute to existing 
knowledge.   Describe previous work that provides a basis to show that  the proposed research can be carried 
out without undue risk to human subjects.   Include relevant citations.  (Refer to specific sections of the 
protocol/grant, if applicable ) 
Public health impact of chronic pain  
Chronic pain, typi[INVESTIGATOR_905123] [ADDRESS_1270571] 
work productivity and healthcare is estimated at $560 -635 billion annually [1], with the average chronic pain patient 
seeking treatment for 7 years [2]. Chronic pain increases the incidences of anxiety and depression and is a major 
predictor of decreased quality of life and increased disability [1]. The chronic pain problem in the US is inextricably linke d 
to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], as opi[INVESTIGATOR_905124]. The goal of  this research is to develop, 
evaluate, and ultimately, commercialize a novel non -pharmacological virtual reality (VR) guided imagery (GI) intervention 
for reducing chronic pain. It is anticipated that effective non -pharmacological pain management will red uce reliance on 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_905125].  
 
The research proposed in this application will capi[INVESTIGATOR_135814] a research foundation that supports the effectiveness of non -
pharmacological interventions, in general, and GI, specifically, f or chronic pain management, as well as on existing 
evidence that VR enhances the efficacy of cognitive -behavioral treatments and is effective in managing pain. Below, this 
research is summarized and the unique contributions of the proposed project to impro ving chronic pain patient care and 
managing opi[INVESTIGATOR_905126].  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_905127]. Up to 80% of individuals prescribe d 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_905128] [3], including nausea, decreased cognitive function, and decreased psychomotor 
coordination [4]. Long -term use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905129], including 
cardiovascular eve nts, fractures, and sexual dysfunction, which are costly in terms of increased length of stay, 
readmissions, and inpatient mortality [4]. Perhaps most seriously, opi[INVESTIGATOR_669811] a high risk of misuse and abuse; 15% -
26% of chronic pain patients misuse or abuse  prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [5] and an estimated 70% of all prescription drug 
overdoses in the US are due to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [6]. Recent reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_905130], resulting in an increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_905131] [7]. Up to 80% of 
new heroin users previously misused prescription painkillers [8].  
 
Equally troubling is a lack of evidence demonstrating the long -term effectiveness of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75163] [9, 10]. Even 
in studies rep orting reductions in chronic pain by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438], the average reduction is only ~32%16. At the same time, long -
term use can lead to tolerance or even hyperalgesia17, which often result in increased prescribed or consumed dosages. 
However, increasing dosages do  not increase pain relief [9] but do increase overdose risk18. The lack of support for 
long-term efficacy and the concomitant risks of opi[INVESTIGATOR_905132] a need for alternative or 
complementary interventions to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_905133]. Indeed, CDC guidelines for 
prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_905134]: �nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopi[INVESTIGATOR_905135]. � 
 
Non-pharmacological interventions effectively reduce chronic pain  
Government agencies have advocated for the use of non -pharmacological interventions for chronic pain management 
[11, 12]. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such interventions, w hich include acupuncture, yoga, 
meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy, for reducing chronic pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and improving functional 
outcomes [13, 14]. Interdisciplinary pain management strategies, incorporating pharmacological and non -
pharmaco logical interventions are cost -effective, reducing emergency room and primary care visits, pain medication use, 
and the number of sick days from work [15, 16]. Compared to pharmacological interventions, non -pharmacological 
interventions also have fewer adv erse effects [13, 14].    
 
 
Though the evidence supporting non -pharmacological interventions for chronic pain is promising, the widespread 
adoption of such interventions has been limited due to the low quality of investigations into non -pharmacological 
interventions for chronic pain [13, 14] and limited access to non -pharmacological interventions, as such interventions 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_905136]. The development of easily delivered, at -home 
solutions for pain management, requiring mi nimal staff or clinician training and time, would be of great value in advancing 
chronic pain management and reducing the risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554].  
 
Guided imagery is an effective non -pharmacological intervention for chronic pain  
GI is a cognitive -behavioral t echnique in which individuals are instructed through guided narration to create sensory -rich 
images in their mind to alter their psychological and physiological states with the goal of reducing their experience of 
pain. The advantages of GI for chronic pai n management are numerous. GI interventions have shown medium to large 
effect sizes for pain reduction and functional outcomes [17 -21], indicating that such interventions are a promising 
treatment option. GI has also been shown to improve mobility [22], qu ality of life [17, 20, 23, 24], mood [18, 20], and self -
efficacy for managing pain [25, 26]. It has been shown to reduce pain medication use [22, 27] and visits to care providers 
[17]. Though not all non -pharmacological interventions are efficacious or app ropriate for all subpopulations of pain 
patients [13, 14], there are few, if any, contraindications for GI and its acceptability and effectiveness has been 
demonstrated across disparate pain populations, including patients with osteoarthritis [22, 28], chr onic tension type 
headaches [29], fibromyalgia [25, 26, 30, 31], abdominal pain [17, 32], and cancer pain [18, 23, 33 -36]. Adverse events, 
both serious and minor, are rarely reported. GI is also a cost effective and accessible form of long -term pain 
manage ment, as it has traditionally been practiced at home with audio recordings. It thus doesn �t take up valuable 
clinician or staff time and is easy for patients to practice with little equipment necessary. Finally, recent neural evidence  
indicates that GI reduces pain via an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -independent mechanism [37], indicating that GI could provide addit ive pain 
reduction over and above that of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. This evidence also supports the use of GI for patients for whom opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
mediated pain pathways are compromised, as m ay be the case for individuals who have developed opi[INVESTIGATOR_905137].  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_905138], limitations in present GI approaches exist. Critically, GI 
depends on the ability of patients to imagine vi vid experiences in their mind. Individual differences in imaging abilities can 
therefore affect the success of GI in reducing pain [23, 33 -35, 38], increasing variability in treatment response and 
reducing the potency of this intervention for many patients . Additionally, when GI is performed at -home, it has 
traditionally been delivered via audiotape or CD. Such delivery methods make it difficult for physicians to adequately 
track patient compliance. Furthermore, meta -studies of GI indicate that research tri als have lacked scientific rigor in 
terms of small sample sizes, lack of proper control conditions, and failure to report effect sizes [39 -43]. Given the critical 
need for easy to deliver, effective non -pharmacological interventions for chronic pain across  large and diverse 
subpopulations of patients, more rigorous evaluations of GI and its generalizability across pain populations are 
warranted.  
 
VR is effective and advantageous for reducing psychological symptoms  
Existing research supports the efficacy of VR for changing attitudes and behaviors [44 -46], supporting the potential for 
VR to change attitudes/behaviors around opi[INVESTIGATOR_905139]. VR is also effective in reducing psychological 
symptoms of behavioral health disorders, as evidenced by [CONTACT_905165], wherein patients are virtually exposed to the things they fear, equivalently reduces psychological symptoms 
compared to in vivo exposure in patients with anxiety, phobias, and PTSD [47 -50]. Available e vidence also shows that 
VR experiences generalize more readily to the real world [51] and are more effective [51, 52] in reducing symptoms 
compared to imaginal exposure, supporting the superiority of VR over therapi[INVESTIGATOR_905140]. These 
benefits of VR are thought to derive from a greater sense of presence -- the feeling of �being there �-- driven by 
[CONTACT_905166] [53, 54].  
 
VR interventions are superior to alternative treatments in a number of other ways as well. Patients have reported 
preferring VR interventions [55, 56] and providers have indicated that they are simpler and more practical [57] than other 
forms of treatment. VR treatments can also be effectively delivered at home [58, 59] and thus, if appropriately scaled, 
could increase accessibility of mental health resources and reduce burdens on clinician time, particularly in areas where 
mental health resources are limited or in high demand. VR is thus likely to be an effective medium for improving the 
efficacy of cognitive -based pain solutions and effecting behavioral change.  
 
VR interventions are effective in reducing pain  
VR seems particularly effective for pain -related interventions. Theoretical perspectives suggest that VR reduces pain via 
top-down modulation of pain pathways by [CONTACT_905167] [60]. Pa in perception requires attention, 
which is a limited cognitive resource, thus diversion of attention from pain is believed to mechanistically account for how 
distraction reduces pain [61]. Evidence that active VR experiences more effectively reduce pain t han passive VR 
experiences [62] supports this idea, as active VR experiences engage more attentional resources than passive ones. 
Immersive, multisensory VR experiences that heighten the sense of presence in a virtual environment also engage 
emotional regi ons of the brain. Given evidence that positive emotions decrease pain [63], the influence of emotional 
regions on pain pathways may be a second mechanism by [CONTACT_905168]. Preliminary 
neuroimaging evidence supports modulation of pain -related brain activity by [CONTACT_905169] [64].  
 
VR has mainly been used as distraction from acute pain such as in burn victims [65], cancer patients [66], and dental 
pain patients [67]. A recent meta -analysis found large effect sizes for immersive VR distra ction in acute pain reduction 
[68]. During acute pain, VR distraction has also been shown to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] [69], anxiety [70], time spent thinking 
about pain [71], and estimates of elapsed time [66]. Cost analysis models suggest that VR therapy for pai n can be cost 
effective, particularly if it reduces length of stay [72]. Importantly, the effects of VR on acute pain do not appear to 
habituate across multiple sessions [73, 74], suggesting that VR interventions can effectively modulate pain over time and  
thus supporting the potential for VR in chronic pain management.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a large and growing literature on VR and acute pain, little research has focused on the effects of VR on chronic 
pain, though preliminary evidence is promising. After single session s of VR, chronic pain patients, including those with 
chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and back pain, have reported reductions in pain up to 60% [75 -78], as well as 
increased motor function [76, 77]. Few studies have examined multisession VR protocols or long -term effects of VR 
interventions for chronic pain, but, for example, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_905141] [79] found that interactive VR completed over 
5-8 weekly sessions resulted in >50% reductions in pain intensity in [ADDRESS_1270572] or reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].

and those that are experimental.  (Refer to specific sections of the protocol/grant, if applicable. Describe any 
differences between the protocol and the local site.  ) 
Specific Aim 1: Develop and add VR -GI prototypes for chronic pain management to the Limbix VR platform.  
R&D efforts will include creation and integration of the VR -GI prototypes to the existing Limbix VR platform. This process 
will be overseen by [CONTACT_905170], [CONTACT_905202]. A number of ideas for content development will be created by [CONTACT_905171]. Steven Richeimer and [CONTACT_905203] at USC. From this list, two ideas will be 
chosen and developed further to create two [ADDRESS_1270588] with their 
virtual environment during the VR -GI experiences. Narrative scripts for an audio -only GI active control condition for the 
clinical t rial proposed in SA3 will also be developed. These will mirror those of the VR -GI prototypes, guiding participants 
to imagine the actions, imagery and sounds that will be directly experienced in the VR -GI intervention.  
 
Virtual scenes will take participant s on adventures through aesthetically pleasing environments that provide patients with 
the opportunity to visualize their pain and, critically, give them the ability to control (i.e., reduce) their pain. The exer cise 
of imagining a reduction in their pain will be accompanied by [CONTACT_905172]. As an example, a VR -GI 
experience might involve searching for a magic wand that, when found, can be pointed at the part of a virtual body where 
patients feel pain; patients will see a visual representation of their pain and will watch it change in VR after using the 
magic wand. Another VR -GI experience might involve entering the �brain�s control room � where patients can choose 
a lever to turn down their pain level, which will be represented in the virtual environment and altered by [CONTACT_905173]. Users will be able to navigate and interact with VR content using a controller, head motion, g aze control, 
and/or voice control to manipulate elements of the virtual environments. All of these methods of  interacting with virtual 
scenes have been tested and are functional on the existing Limbix VR platform.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate feasibility and usability of VR -GI experiences based on patient and provider feedback.  
After the two VR -GI prototypes have be en developed and integrated onto the Limbix VR platform, 4 chronic pain patients 
(2 with chronic back pain, CNBP, and 2 with complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS) will be recruited for initial feasibility 
and usability testing of the experiences. Four prov iders from the USC Pain Center will also be informally recruited to give 
feedback on the VR -GI experiences. Patients and providers will view both VR -GI experiences (each 15 minutes long) 
and complete a qualitative interview conducted by a trained USC resea rch coordinator. Patient views on feasibility and 
usability will be evaluated via questions pertaining to ease of use, comfort, willingness to use again, enjoyment of the 
experience, and perceived feasibility of the proposed at -home intervention protocol a nd integration in daily routine. 
Provider views on feasibility and usability will be evaluated via questions pertaining to ease of use and willingness to use 
in their practice, perceived potential for the proposed intervention to improve patient outcomes, and perceived feasibility 
of integrating the proposed intervention into their workflow. Feasibility questionnaires will be developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lake in 
collaboration with [CONTACT_905204]. Iterative changes to VR -GI prototypes and intervention protocol will be ma de according 
to feedback received. Additional feedback will be sought, if necessary, until the VR -GI experiences and proposed 
protocol are deemed acceptable to providers and patients and project PIs. Patients will be compensated for their time.  
 
The Limbix  VR Kit was initially designed such that a clinician would use the tablet to select content and relevant settings 
for a patient to experience in VR. Patients � abilities to use the Limbix VR Kit without the help of research staff will also 
be evaluated to e nsure that the VR -GI intervention can be easily delivered at home. Changes to the user experience will 
be made to improve usability, if necessary.  
 
Specific Aim 3: Evaluate feasibility, usability, and preliminary efficacy of a 2 -week VR -GI intervention cli nical trial.  
Participants & Procedures: 36 chronic pain patients (18 with chronicback pain, CBP, and 18 with complex regional pain 
syndrome, CRPS) with no significant movement problems will be recruited from the USC Pain Center by [CONTACT_905174]. Chr onic pain will be defined as an average pain level of 5 or greater on a 0 -to-10 pain intensity scale for 
greater than 3 months. Patients will be individually randomized to the VR -GI condition (n = 24, 12 CBP and 12 CRPS) or 
the audio -only GI active control  condition (n = 12, 6 CBP and 6 CRPS). After informed consent and eligibility screening, 
all patients will complete pre -assessment questionnaires, an individual training session for completing VR -GI using the 
Limbix VR Kit or audio -only GI using an mp3 pla yer, and their first session of GI. Patients will be instructed to practice GI 
at home once per day for [ADDRESS_1270589] data collection.  
 
Potential Problems: The Limbix team has extensive experience in product development and thus has first -hand 
knowledge of the problems that may be faced during the development of this product. Limbix has already solve d many 
feasibility issues inherent in delivering a VR intervention for patients, as ascertained through extensive user research, via  
the development of the commercially available Limbix VR Kit. The usability and feasibility testing outlined above have 
been  explicitly designed to expose issues early in the development process to help avoid unanticipated problems in 
product development.  
 
One potential issue we foresee is whether patients will comply with at -home GI practice. Tracking compliance via the VR 
Headset will allow for the evaluation of this possibility. If compliance is found to be an issue with early study participant s, 
strategi es could be employed to encourage compliance, such as sending reminders, discussing with patients how to 
better integrate practice into their daily routines, or having patients directly report daily practice to the research 
coordinator to increase account ability. Tracking compliance objectively, rather than relying on subjective report, will not 
be possible for the audio -only GI group. Though this represents a limitation in the study design, it nevertheless reflects 
an advantage of using VR for delivering GI. Another potential problem is that patients may not return loaned equipment. 
To limit this possibility, participants will be financially incentivized to return equipment at the conclusion of the study. 
Patients will receive the equipment by [CONTACT_905175] r address along with a pre -paid envelope to return the equipment. 
Finally, participants will be asked to use online surveys to report pain ratings before and after at -home GI practice, 
requiring that they have internet access at home. We expect that this w ill not be problematic for most participants. If 
necessary, participants can keep written logs of daily practice.  
 
  
  12.2.  Describe the statistical considerations for the study, how the sample size was determined, and how the results 
will be analyzed, if applicable.  (Refer to specific sections of the protocol/grant, if applicable ) 
Given that the goals of this study are primarily to demonstrate feasibility and to evaluate efficacy outcomes insofar as to 
prepare for a larger clinical trial, the sample size of this planned pi[INVESTIGATOR_905146]. Guidelines suggest that [ADDRESS_1270590] to enroll 36 patients with chronic pain (18 C NBP and 18 CRPS) of which 24 (12 CBP and 
CRPS) will be randomized to receive VR -GI and 12 (6 CBP and 6 CRPS) will be randomized to receive audio -only GI. 
Given that the goals of this study are primarily to demonstrate feasibility and to evaluate efficacy o utcomes insofar as to 
prepare for a larger clinical trial, the sample size of this planned pi[INVESTIGATOR_905146]. Guidelines suggest that [ADDRESS_1270591] sizes are expected to be medium to large.  
 
To evaluate feasibility, outcomes of enrollment feasibility, intervention tolerability, and compliance will be qualitatively 
assessed. Additionally, confidence intervals will be calculated for each outcome measure using varying levels of 
confidence to evaluate the strength of preliminary evidence that the true value of the feasibility metric includes an 80% 
threshold. An 80% threshold for each outcome will be considered a conservative measure of feasibility. Feasibility and 
acceptability of the intervention will also be qualitatively evaluated based on post -assessment interviews with patients. 
Post-intervention patient interviews are expected to demonst rate that the at -home VR -GI intervention was feasible for 
patients to integrate into their daily routine, easy to use, and deemed acceptable and efficacious for pain management.  
 
For efficacy measures, means, variability, and effect sizes for differences b etween pre - and post -intervention changes in 
pain intensity, pain medication use, functional outcomes, quality of life, and mood will be calculated. A confidence 
interval approach, using multiple levels of confidence to evaluate the strength of preliminary  evidence, will be taken to 
evaluate whether the mean treatment difference is above zero and whether confidence intervals include a clinically 
important difference for each outcome. Pain intensity ratings will serve as the primary outcome measure in a foll ow-up 
Phase II clinical trial. The clinical significance for pain reduction will be considered 30%. For all other measures, clinica l 
significance will be defined as a standardized effect size between 0.[ADDRESS_1270592] sizes for the VR -GI experience. To evaluate the generali zability of VR -GI, whether there are notable differences in 
feasibility or efficacy between the two pain populations, CNBP and CRPS, using a confidence interval approach will also 
be evaluated. No such differences are anticipated. A larger subsequent Phase  II randomized clinical trial will allow for   
 
statistical comparisons between conditions (VR -GI and audio -only GI) and pain populations (CNBP and CRPS).  
 
As the extant literature has yet to evaluate whether the short -term effects of VR on chronic pain are sustained across 
repeated sessions, the time c ourse of daily pain intensity ratings pre - and post -GI practice will be plotted and assessed 
for evidence of habituation effects over time (accounting for anticipated changes in pre -practice pain ratings over time).  
 
As per recommendations for pi[INVESTIGATOR_197820] s, formal hypothesis testing will not be prioritized in data analysis, as the small 
sample sizes in this proposed project would only allow for the detection of large effects. The sample size and planned 
data analysis, which will rely on qualitative and con fidence interval approaches, are appropriate to accomplish the stated 
objectives of this clinical trial. A larger subsequent Phase II clinical trial will allow for a statistical comparison of VR -GI 
relative to active control conditions, such as audio -only GI, VR relaxation or distraction, and usual care over a longer 
intervention duration.  
 
Measures & Analyses: Feasibility outcome measures will include enrollment feasibility (i.e., proportion of recruited 
participants ineligible to participate and/or who de cline to enroll), intervention tolerability (i.e., proportion of enrolled 
participants who discontinue intervention, are lost to follow -up, or experience adverse events), and compliance (i.e., 
proportion of at -home daily practice completed). Compliance can  be tracked via the VR Headset, which will log the time 
and duration of practice. Measures of pain ratings, pain medication use, functional outcomes, quality of life, and mood 
will be collected before and after the [ADDRESS_1270593]. Richeimer. Due to the small sample size of this feasibility study, statistica l 
analyses will not be prioritized. Instead, qualitative analysis and confidence interval approaches will be taken (see 
Protocol Synopsis) to evaluate feasibility of the VR -GI intervention and to prepare for a larger Phase II clinical trial to 
evaluate efficacy. Exploratory qualitative analyses will assess whether daily reported pain reductions habituate over time, 
whether one of the VR -GI prototypes was preferred over the other, whether VR -GI differentially affected CNBP and 
CRPS patients, and whether sex, ethnicity or race affected outcomes. All data analysis will be conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lake 
and supervised by [CONTACT_905176].

 The informed consent process will begin with a concise and focused presentation of the key information that is 
most likely to assist a prospective participant in understanding the reasons why one might or might not want to 
participate in the research  
 They will not be forced, threatened or coerced in any way to participate in this research, and no undue influence 
or other form of constraint will be used to recruit individuals to participate in this research or to retain currently 
enrolled subjects. (Not e: "Coercion" is the use or threat of the use of force to gain compliance. "Undue 
influence" is when an individual who is in a position of authority (e.g., physician, teacher, employer) exerts 
inappropriate or excessive manipulation to gain power and compl iance over a vulnerable individual (potential 
research subject). "Constraint" means force, obligation, or pressure.)    
 They will not be punished or denied something which they would normally receive (e.g., threatening to withdraw 
health services to which an individual would otherwise be entitled) if they choose not to participate in this 
research or choose to withdraw early from participation.  
 They will be given an adequate amount of time to consider participation in the study relative to the initiation of 
study procedures.  
 The information presented to individuals during recruitment and consent will reflect that provided in the 
informed consent document/informed consent script.  
 The recruitment and consent process will not promise them a certainty of cure or benefit beyond what is 
outlined in the informed consent document/informed consent script.  
 The recruitment and consent process will take place in an area in which it is possible to maintain privacy and 
confidentiality.  
 They will be given the opportunity to take the informed consent document home in order to discuss participation 
with their family, friends and/or others before making a definitive decision.  
 They will receive payment for their participation, but the amount of payment will be commensurate with their 
participation (not an inducement for participation), and receipt of the payment will not be contingent upon the 
individual's completion of the study. (Note: The specific method, sched ule, and amount of payment must be 
outlined in the payment section of the application.)

  27. Risk/Benefit Assessment - Risks    
  27.1.  Risks, Discomforts and Potential Harms: Describe the  risks associated with each research  intervention.   Include 
consideration of physical, psychological, social, and other factors.  (check all that apply)  
 Discrimination based on genetic findings.  
 Some people may find it upsetting to learn that they have certain mutations or errors in genes that could lead to future 
health problems for themselves or their children.  
 Some of the questions may make the participant feel uneasy or embarrassed.  
 There is a small risk that people who are not connected with this study will learn a participant �s identity or 
their personal information.  
 The participants are providing highly sensitive, personal information in this study. If people not connected with the 
study learn this information, they could have problems getting a new job, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_905153], finding housing, or 
getting insurance (health, disability, or life insurance). In highly unlikely situations, they could be charged with  a crime.  
 Biomedical risks, including drug, device, biologics, radiation, surgery or other research procedures (please specify).  
 The research includes the risk or disclosure that a participant may engage in self -harm or attempt suicide.  
 Venipuncture risks including: mild discomfort (or pain), bruising and swelling around the puncture site, dizziness or 
fainting, or infection (rare).  
 Other (specify below)  
 
27.1.1
. Describe the biomedical or other possible risks and discomforts participants could experience during 
this study:  (HSC:  refer to specific sections of the protocol, grant, investigator's brochure or product 
labeling,  if applicable ) 
There are minimal risks associated with VR. Some individuals may experience cybersickness or nausea during 
VR use. Some participants may also find the VR headset uncomfortable. GI may sometimes increase frustration 
and self -blame if participants do not experience reductions in pain commensurate with guided narration. Th ese 
risks are considered minimal. Both VR -GI and audio -only GI experiences will be specifically designed to guide 
patients to reduce their experience of pain rather than fully turn their pain off to reduce this risk. There are 
minimal risks in the administ ration of questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Some participants may 
experience boredom or discomfort during the completion of these procedures. If any participant feels distressed 
during any research procedure, participation will be immediately term inated at his or her request.  
   
 
  27.2.  Describe the precautions that will  be taken to minimize risks/harms.  (check all that apply)  
 We will use our best efforts to keep the findings in this study as confidential as possible.  
 Subjects can choose to skip or stop answering any questions that make them uncomfortable.  
 Data will be coded and identity stored separate from data.    
 
 Data will be collected anonymously.

27.2.1
. Other precautions (including biomedical precautions) that will be taken to minimize risks/harms 
include:  (HSC:  refer to specific sections of the protocol/grant, if applicable ) 
To decrease the risk of cybersickness, VR content will be run at the highest possible refresh rate and will be 
explicitly designed to minimize virtual movement that the user does not have control over, as this can create a 
disconnect between an individual �s visual experience and vestibular system which can increase the likelihood 
of cybersickness. The prevalence of cybersickness will be evaluated during initial feasibility testing and the VR -
GI experiences will be adjusted accordingly, if necessary. VR -GI will be discontinued for any participant who 
experiences cybersickness. To minimize the discomfort in wearing a VR headset, the duration of time 
participants spend in VR will be limited to ~15 minutes at a time. Participants may discontinue the intervention  if 
they find the headset uncomfortable.  
 
Headsets will be cleaned and sanitized before being given to the patients.  
 
To minimize the psychological risk of frustration or self -blame due to participants not experiencing reductions in 
their experience of pai n, this possibility will be explicitly addressed during the consenting process. It will be 
emphasized that changes in the experience of pain will likely happen gradually, rather than all at once. 
Additionally, participants will be guided during the VR -GI experiences to reduce their pain intensity, rather than 
turn off their pain entirely to appropriately set participants � expectations and to minimize the risk of frustration 
or self -blame. The extent of pain reduction visualized in VR -GI may be increased at the discretion of the 
participant throughout the intervention. Participants will be able to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Richeimer or [CONTACT_142863] during 
the intervention if they experience frustration or self -blame.

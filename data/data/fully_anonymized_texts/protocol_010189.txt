Purpose of Study : Please describe:  
Uterosacral ligament suspension is a commonly performed procedure to support the vaginal 
apex at the time of pelvic reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_179799] 
a well established durable option for patients, there is little research describing ligament 
suspension suture location in the living model.  The available literature is limited to cadaveric 
studies, which suggest suture placement is in close proximity to vital structures such as the 
ureter, blood vessels, rectum and nerves.  
 
Hypothesis or Research Question  
We, therefore, seek to describe suture location in relation to the surrounding anatomy in post-
operative patients following high uterosacral ligament suspension.  Our secondary aim is to 
determine safe zones for suture placement.  
 
Background  
High uterosacral ligament suspension is a common procedure performed for the treatment of 
pelvic organ prolapse. It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_667724]. The technique involves affixing the vaginal apex to the 
bilateral uterosacral ligaments using either permanent or delayed-absorbable sutures.  
 
Although considered a safe and minimally invasive procedure, complications from suture 
placement have been well documented and can cause significant morbidity for the patient . 
Ureteral occlusion has been reported to be as high as 4.5-11% [1, 3, 4]. Other risks include 
injury to major blood vessels and nerve entrapment.  
 
Cadaver studies have evaluated suture location relative to the ureter, rectal lumen and sacral 
nerves. In one study using 15 cadavers, sutures were noted at a mean distance of 14 mm from 
Study ID# 15-092     2  
 
Pauls the ureter with a range of 0-33 mm [2]. Additionally, sutures were a mean distance of 10 mm 
from the rectal lumen [2]. Vascular perforation by [CONTACT_667726] 
4.1% in another model [2]. Nevertheless, cadaveric studies have inherent limitations due to 
nature of tissue fixation and lack of dynamic function of nerves, vessels and the ureter.  
 
Postoperative pain, numbness and weakness from nerve injuries during uterosacral ligament 
suspension may occur in up to 1.6- 6.8% of patients [5,6,7].   Nerve entrapment by [CONTACT_667727] [8 ,9].  However, current imaging 
techniques prohibit characterization of the pelvic nerves accurately.  Clinical information 
regarding nerve function pre and post operatively will inform regarding anatomic placement of 
these sutures.  
 
A more thorough understanding of the postoperative location of the sutures placed during 
uterosacral ligament suspension will be valuable to pelvic surgeons.  Characterization of the 
surrounding anatomy in a living model will enhance surgical technique. This in turn may allow 
us to delineate safer suture locations and decrease the incidence of morbid complications for 
patients.  
 
Research Plan  
● Study Design  
o Prospective cohort  
● Setting for the study  
o Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates and Good Samaritan and Bethesda North Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]  
 
● Participants  
o Describe  
▪ Seventeen women (aged 18- 85) under the care of Cincinnati Urogynecology 
Associates who have chosen vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament 
suspension (USLS) as their treatment choice for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) will be 
approached for enrollment. 
▪  At the time of surgery, a titanium vascular clip (size small) will be applied to the 
base of each delayed absorbable suture placed at the vaginal apex on the internal 
vaginal side to help in identification by [CONTACT_9661].   
▪ All patients will undergo intraoperative cystoscopy with documentation of ureteral 
patency as per stand ard surgical technique.  
▪ All patients will undergo a postoperative CBC and BMP on postoperative day #[ADDRESS_901920] protocol for the division.  
▪ On POD#1, patients will undergo CT scan of the pelvis. The CT scan will involve 
administration of IV contrast for imaging of the ureters and vascular structures.  
▪ The clip will fall off when the sutures dissolve at 12 week postoperatively.  
▪ All patients will be asked to complete a lower extremity neurological questionnaire 
preoperatively and postoperatively  
Study ID# 15-092     3  
 
Pauls ▪ All patients will undergo a preoperative and postoperative lower extremity 
neurological physical exam by [CONTACT_50501]  
 
o Inclusion criteria  
▪ Women, aged 18- [ADDRESS_901921] elected USLS  for treatment  
o Exclusio
n criteria 
▪ Contraindication to computed tomography (CT), or intravenous (IV) contrast  
▪ Those with claustrophobia  
▪ Previous POP surgery  
▪ Previous pelvic surgery to the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], ovaries, or rectum  
▪ Previous pelvic radiation  
▪ Known pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis  
▪ Those with preexisting ureteral or vascular pathology or sacral anatomic abnormality 
▪ Those with connective tissue disorders 
▪ Those with preexisting neuropathy, chronic lower extremity pain disorders, or 
neurological disorders 
▪ Those with renal anomalies such as pelvic kidney, duplication of the collecting 
system, prior nephrectomy 
▪ Those with allergy to titanium 
▪ Removal of the uterosacral sutures due to ureteral obstruction intraoperatively 
o This is a one-group pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], therefore a sample size calculation was not performed; 
all participants will undergo the same radiographic procedures  
A sample size of 15 women was felt to be representative, we will enroll 17 to 
allow for possible exclusions.  
 
● Data Collection 
o Basic demographics, surgical procedure data and laboratory results will be collected 
(Appendix A)  
o We will collect data on the exact location of the uterosacral sutures including its 
relationship to the vasculature, ureters and rectum using computed tomography.  Exact 
imaging protocols have been standardized by [CONTACT_667728].  
(Appendix B)  
o Both sutures on each side will be measured at the midsection of 
the clip relative to structures 
o Distances (in mm) between the sutures and surrounding structures such as the bilateral   
ureters and rectum will all be measured.  
o The PI [INVESTIGATOR_667725]-investigator will review all images for measurements.  
These will be taken using standard radiologic techniques.   
o We will collect data on the preoperative and postoperative neurological physical exam 
findings (Appendix C)  
 
Study ID# 15-[ADDRESS_901922] data from the preoperative and postoperative neurological questionnaire 
(Appendix D, E)  
o We will collect data 6 weeks postoperatively regarding any complications during the 
postoperative period  
 
● Intervention or experimental aspect of the study  
o This is a descriptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]; no intervention  
 
● Statistical Analysis  
o Descriptive statistics will be calculated for demographics and all measurements. Mean 
(SD) values will be used for data meeting the assumptions for normality; median (IQR) 
values will be used for data not meeting the assumptions for parametric procedures.  
 
Ethical Considerations  
● Informed consent  
o Following study recruitment in the offices of Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates, the 
informed consent process will be administered by [CONTACT_667729]. Informed consent statements will be kept in a locked file drawer in 
the office of the principal investigator, which will be locked when unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_530]. They will 
be kept for three years following study closure, and then shredded.  
● Privacy information  
Patients will be identified by a unique study ID.  Patient names will be used solely for the 
purpose of recruitment for the study.  Data sheets will be identified with the study ID number.  
This information will not be kept with the data, nor will any participant’s name [CONTACT_667730].  The study records will be stored -for 2 years after completion of the study, and 
then deleted/purged.  Paper data sheets will be kept for [ADDRESS_901923]/Budget

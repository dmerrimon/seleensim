Sponsor Sangamo BioSciences, Inc. 
Investigational Products SB-728-T (Autologous CD4+ T-cells gene tically modified at the CCR5 gene 
by [CONTACT_144493]-728). 
Objectives Primary:  
To evaluate the safety and tole rability of escalating doses of 
cyclophosphamide administered up to 3 days prior to SB-728-T infusion. 
Secondary:  
1. Evaluate the effect of escalating doses of cyclophosphamide on SB-728-T 
engraftment 
2. Evaluate the effect of SB-728-T on  plasma HIV-1 RNA levels following 
HAART interruption 
3. Evaluate long-term persistence of SB-728-T in peripheral blood as 
measured by [CONTACT_144494] 
4. Evaluate change in CD4+ T-cell count s in peripheral blood after treatment 
with SB-728-T 
5. Evaluate the change in HIV reservoirs  as part of exploratory research 
Study Population Up to 40 aviremic HIV-infected s ubjects on stable HAART may be enrolled 
and treated in 5 dose cohorts.  
Main Inclusion 
Criteria HIV diagnosed  men and women >  18 years of age on HAART with 
undetectable viral loads for the preced ing 3 months and peripheral blood 
CD4+ T-cell counts > 500 cells/µL at screening. 
Study Design Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation, multi-center study. 
Treatment Plan Up to 40 subjects will be enrolled and treated in one of five treatment cohorts: 
Cohort 1: Intravenous cyclophosphamide 200 mg 
Cohort 2: Intravenous cyclophosphamide 0.5 g/m2 
Cohort 3: Intravenous cyclophosphamide 1.0 g/m2 
Cohort 4: Intravenous cyclophosphamide 2.0 g/m2 
Cohort 5: Intravenous cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 
 
Within each cohort, treatment will be staggered so that each subsequent 
subject cannot be infused with cyclophosphamide until at least [ADDRESS_164374] within a cohort develops  a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) defined

Grade 4 hematological AE related to  cyclophosphamide, 3 additional subjects 
will be enrolled and treated in that cohort.   If no DLT develops in 3 s ubjects in Cohort 5 (1.5 g/m
2), additional subjects 
may be enrolled into that cohort.   Upon evaluation of data from Cohort 5 (1.5 g/m
2), the sponsor may elect to 
enroll  additional subjects into  Cohort 3 (1.0 g/m2). 
 Subjects with aviremia and CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/µL will have their anti-
retroviral treatment stop ped [ADDRESS_164375] 16 weeks.  
During the 16-week treatment interrup tion, HAART will be reinstituted in 
subjects whose CD4 cell counts drop to  <500 cells/µL an d/or whose HIV-
RNA increases to >100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL on three consecutive measurements 
tested every 2 weeks. 
At the end of the 16-week treatment interruption:  
• HAART will be reinstituted in subjects with HIV RNA levels >10,000 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and/or CD4 <500 cells/µL.  
• Subjects with HIV RNA levels ≤10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and CD4 count ≥ 
500 cells/µL may elect to remain  off HAART and undergo extended 
TI (subjects with HIV RNA levels below limit of detection will remain 
off HAART).  
During extended TI, HAART will be reinstit uted in subjects when one or both 
of the following criteria are met:  
• HIV RNA levels > 10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, confirmed by [CONTACT_144495] 
• CD4 count < 500 cells/µL, confirmed by [CONTACT_144496] [ADDRESS_164376] s treated in that cohort. The primary focus of this 
study is to evaluate the safety of  escalating doses of cyclophosphamide 
administered prior to the SB-728-T infusion.  As such, if no adverse events are 
observed in a group of three evaluable s ubjects, we can be 95% confident that 
the true adverse event rate is less th an 70%. Expansion of each cohort to 6 
subjects will decrease the rate to 46%.Th ere will be limited statistical power to

The advent of potent anti-retrovi ral agents has changed HIV inf ection from a nearly universal 
fatal disease to a chronic viral infection. However,  in response to selection pressures associated 
with the use of antiretrovirals, the virus is developi[INVESTIGATOR_144449]. Thus, 
there is a need for new therapeutic approach es that can eradicate HIV such as T-cell 
immunotherapy. The objectives of this therapy are to augment HIV-specific T-cells and to 
reverse or decrease the progressi ve destruction of CD4+ T-cells that leads to clinical AIDS. 
However, these CD4+ T-cells remain susceptible to infection with HIV. Sangamo BioSciences, 
Inc. (Sangamo) has developed a process to modify autologous CD4+ T-cells ex vivo  at the CCR5 
gene by [CONTACT_144497] (ZFN) encoded by  [CONTACT_144498]-728 in a replicatio n deficient adenoviral 
vector. Since CCR5 is an importa nt co-receptor for HIV entry, it is hypothesi zed that disruption 
of CCR5 in CD4+ T-cells with zinc finger nucl eases will offer a survival advantage to these 
cells.  
SB-728-T is the name [CONTACT_144555]. SB-728-T consists of autologous enrich ed CD4+ T-cells that have been transduced ex 
vivo with SB-728 resulting in modification of the CCR5 gene. SB-728 is a replication deficient 
recombinant Ad5/35 viral vector encoding th e CCR5 specific ZFNs (SBS8196z and SBS8267) 
which through transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_144450]. The 
two ZFNs bind to a composite 24-bp sequence fo und specifically in the re gion encoding the first 
transmembrane domain of the CCR5 gene, just upstream from the naturally occurring CCR5 delta 32 mutation. Expression of the CCR5-specifi c ZFNs induces a double stranded break which 
is repaired by [CONTACT_144499] ~30% of cells 
transduced with SB-728. These insertions and deletions di srupt the CCR5 coding sequence 
leading to frameshift mutation and termination of CCR5 protein expression. Additional human 
pre-clinical information can be found in the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure for SB-728-T.

sponsored by [CONTACT_3374] (protocol number 806383) and the other two by 
[CONTACT_144500]
o (SB-728-0902 and SB-728-1002). SB-728-[ADDRESS_164379] enrolled a 
total of 21 aviremic subjects on HAART to date ; 6 immunologic responde rs (IR) with CD4 > 450 
cells/µL and 15 immunologic nonre sponders (INR) with CD4 < 500 cells/uL. Subjects were 
infused with 5 to 30 billion cells. The mean  CD4 and SB-728-T count increased by 1533/µL 
(range 216-3025) and 83/µL, respectively, on day 7 in IR and by 820/uL (range 133-4467) and 
19/µL, respectively, in IN R from the 2 studies. Increases in  CD4 over time correlated with SB-
728-T engraftment ( г=0.78, p<0.0001). SB-728-T was detected in the gut mucosa of all 18 
subjects biopsied (median 6%).  
A HAART treatment interrupti on (TI) was performed 4 weeks after SB-728-T infusion (5-10 
billion cells) in the 6 IRs. HIV-RNA dropped ~0.8- 2.1 log from their peak levels in 3 of the 6 
subjects ( Figure 1.1-1 ). In one CCR5 delta [ADDRESS_164380] with a viral setpoint of

The results to date suggest SB-728-T infusion increases CD4 counts that persist over time. SB-
728-T expands rapi[INVESTIGATOR_144451]. Pr eliminary data suggest that SB-728-T may 
decrease proviral DNA. In one subject with th e highest level of CCR5 modification, VL was 
controlled (< limit of detection) without HAART . There have been no serious adverse events 
(SAEs), associated with SB-728-T, reported to da te. SB-728-T infusions were well tolerated with 
only mild reversible infusion related adverse even ts (AEs). The most common AEs were a garlic

markedly within these tissues with the thymus reaching normal numbers by [CONTACT_4475] 14 and twice 
normal by [CONTACT_4475] 21. The bone marrow and spleen were normal by [CONTACT_4475] 7 and 11, respectively but the lymph nodes were only at 30% of normal by [CONTACT_4475] 21 (Willers and Sluis, 1975). These data demonstrate that the lymphodepleting effects of  cyclophosphamide are readily reversible with 
rapid repopulation of lymphoid organs  when the drug is discontinued.

cell growth factors such as type 1 IFN, 2) de ndritic cell expansion and activation with antigen

and 5) elimination of regulatory T-cells.  
Lymphodepletive treatment to enhance engraftmen t of adoptively transferred T-cells has been

in these studies consisted of antigen specific or  chimeric T cell receptor -transduced autologous 
cells. Recently there has been significant clinical success with this approach, with 
lymphodepletion an important contributing factor . Dudley and Rosenber g at the NCI treated 
melanoma subjects with cyclophosphamide and fluda rabine prior to adop tive cell transfer of 
expanded tumor infiltrating lymphoc ytes and showed a 51% objective  clinical response rate of 
tumor shrinkage (Dudley et al., 2005; Dudley  and Rosenberg, 2003). More recently, the 
beneficial effect of a non-myeloablative ly mphodepleting regimen on adoptive T-cell therapy 
was demonstrated in chronic lymphocytic leukemi a patients treated with low doses of chimeric 
antigen receptor CD19 (C ART19) transduced autologous T-cel ls (Porter et al., 2011). These 
results demonstrate that nonmyeloablative lymphode pletion prior to adoptiv e transfer of T-cells 
results in greatly enhanced in vivo expansion.  Furthermore, the expanded cells retain their 
immunologic function.

diseases including  Goodpasture's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, 
Wegener's granulomatosis, and membranous glom erulonephritis. Adverse effects and toxicities, 
including hemorrhagic cystitis  and gonadal dysfunction are dos e dependent and are uncommon 
with total cumulative doses below 10 g. The risk of malignancy w ith oral therap y is proportional 
to the cumulative dose and increases substant ially at cumulative dose s greater than 30 g. 
Treatment with cumulative doses of 10 g or less has been shown to be associated with incidence 
of malignancy similar to that of a control population (Baker et  al., 1987). Importantly, unlike 
other cytoreductive agents, cyclophosphamide has no cumulative bone marrow toxicity. 
Table 1.2.2-1  is reproduced from a paper detaili ng the side-effects of cyclophosphamide in 
subjects with autoimmune disease (Martin et al , 1997). A total of 329 subjects with a variety of 
autoimmune diseases received intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide in nine studies. The mean 
cumulative dose ranged from 1.[ADDRESS_164385]

cyclophosphamide that was administered in these two studies was 4.7 and 10 grams.

ide on HIV cellular reservoir in subjects receiving HAART was 
evaluated in Clinical Study ACTG 380 (Bartlett et al., 2002). Ten treatm ent naïve HIV subjects 
were treated with stavudine, lamivudine and nelf inavir. When the subjects became aviremic on 
two serial tests, they were randomized  equally to HAART al one or HAART plus 
cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide was administer ed every 6 weeks at three escalating dose 
levels (750 mg/m2, 1.2 g/m2 and 1.8 g/m2, or a cumulative dose of 3.75 g/m2 over 12 weeks). 
Total lymphocyte counts decreas ed by a mean of 709 cells/mm3 (p<0.02 compared with control 
patients), and CD4 counts were not significantly  affected. HIV proviral DNA decreased similarly 
in both groups but HIV RNA increased in th e cyclophosphamide group, an observation that was 
attributed to non-compliance with HAART. The study demonstrated that the use of 
cyclophosphamide was lymphodepleting, did not significantly reduce total CD4 counts, and was 
adequately tolerated. Toxicity included transien t nausea following the infusion; one subject with 
Grade [ADDRESS_164387] with Grade 2 thrombocytopenia. Additional information on the safety of cyclophosphamide is discussed in Section 9.2.  
1.3 HAART Treatment Interruption 
HAART TI was initially advocated  to enhance antiviral immune response in acute HIV infection 
(Paton, 200
8) and in the setting of virologic fa ilure and multidrug resistance (Lawrence et al., 
2003). However, studies conducted to date have failed to demonstrate a clinical bene fit in either 
setting. In subjects with successfully  treated chronic HIV infection, TI  is associated with inferior 
clinical outcomes (Oxenius et  al, 2002). However, TI has been successfully deployed as an 
analytical method to assess the effectiveness of different imm unologic/immune-modulatory 
interventions, especially during vaccine tr ials. The kinetics of viral rebound are well 
characterized, typi[INVESTIGATOR_144453] [ADDRESS_164388] that TI  can be safely performed in  the currently proposed study 
(Section 9.3 ).

the infusion of CCR5 disrupted CD4 cells. However, the correlation of in vitro  testing to immune 
protection in vivo  is largely unknown (van Lunzen et  al, 2007). By [CONTACT_2163], plasma HIV 
RNA level is an excellent biomarker for assessing th e antiviral activity of a test agent in patients 
with chronic HIV infection. Therefore, sustai ned suppression of plasma HIV-[ADDRESS_164389] of an immunologic intervention such as SB-728-T. 
In the current study, only subjects with aviremia and CD4 cell counts ≥ 500 cells/µL at the 
initiation of the TI will have HAAR T interrupted. In addition, subjec ts will be monitored closely 
during the TI period and HAART will be reinstitut ed in subjects in whom CD4 cell counts drop 
to <500 cells/µL and/or whose HIV-RNA incr eases to >100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL over a sustained 
period (defined as three consecutive measurements tested every 2 weeks). 
At the end of the 16-week TI: 
• HAART will be reinstituted  in subjects with HIV RNA levels >10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
and/or CD4 <500 cells/µL.   
• Subjects with HIV RNA levels ≤  10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µL 
may elect to remain off HAART and under go extended TI (subjects with HIV RNA 
levels below the limit of detection will remain off HAART).  
 
During extended TI, HAART will be reinstituted in  subjects when one or both of the following 
criteria are met: 
• HIV RNA levels > 10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, confirmed by [CONTACT_144503]. 
• CD4 count < 500 cells/µL, confirmed by [CONTACT_144504].

subjects were randomized to receive a single in fusion of CD3/CD28 stimula ted T- cells, either 
12 or 100 days after stem cell transplantation (Rapoport et al., 2005). T-cells were infused two 
days after stem cell infusion in the subsequent study (Rapoport et al., 2011 and Stadtmauer et al., 
2011). There was a rapid reconstitution of lymphocyt es with normal circulat ing levels achieved 
by [CONTACT_4475] 5. A lymphocytosis was observed in ~30% of the patients that persisted for up to 8 weeks.

T-cell infusions in these studies were well tole rated with chills/rigors, nausea and low grade 
fevers the most common AEs. Similarly, cyclophos phamide has been safely administered to 
patients with a variety of conditions including autoimmune diseases and infection with HIV 
(Section 1.2) . At the non-myeloablative doses of  cyclophosphamide (200 mg to 2.0 g/m2) that 
will be administered in this study, the adverse effects are read ily managed by [CONTACT_144505] ( Section 9.2 ). The top dose of 
cyclophosphamide selected for this study, 2.0 g/m2, is below the total cumulative dose of 3.75 
g/m2 that had been safely administered to HIV infected patients in a previous study ( Section 
1.2.3). Collectively, these data suggest that the potential benefit of expanding HIV-1 resistant 
CCR5 modified T-cells may be  greater than the potential adverse effects of low dose 
cyclophosphamide. 
1.5 Study Hypothesis 
The objectives of T-cell imm
unotherapy in people infected with  HIV, are to augment HIV-
specific T-cells and to reverse or decrease the progr essive destruction of CD 4+ T-cells that leads 
to clinical AIDS. SB-728-T has been safely ad ministered to over 60 HI V-infected subjects in 
three clinical trials conducted to date. The level of engraftment has varied from negligible to 
~10% of the CD4+ T-cells in the vascular compartment. Preliminary analyses of HAART TI in the UPENN study suggest that an anti-HIV effect may correlate  with the level of SB-728-T 
engraftment. Concurrently, non-myeloablativ e lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide has 
been demonstrated to enhance engraftment of a doptively transferred T-ce lls through a variety of 
mechanisms ( Section 1.2 ). The current study is being undertaken to increase SB-728-T 
engraftment through the administ ration of low non-myeloablative doses of cyclophosphamide.

This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalati on, multi-center study. Subjects who satisfy all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Section 4 ) are eligible to participat e in this study. Within each 
cohort, treatment will be staggered so that ea ch subsequent subject cannot be infused with 
cyclophosphamide until at least [ADDRESS_164392] CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/µL will undergo a minimum 16 week TI 
beginning 6 weeks after infusion of SB-728-T. TI  may be extended beyond 16 weeks for subjects 
whose HIV RNA levels ≤ 10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µL at the end of the 16-
week TI. Subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_164393] ion and/or an optiona l leukapheraesis may be performed during

3.2 Number of Subjects 
Up to 40 avirem
ic HIV-infected subjects on stable HAART will be enrolled  and treated in 5 dose 
cohorts (3-6 subjects/cohort).  
3.3 Dose Escalation 
The decis

(SMC). Safety data through Week [ADDRESS_164394] within a cohort develops a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) defined as a Grade 3 
non-hematological AE excluding alopecia or Grade 4 hematological AE (all deemed related to cyclophosphamide), 3 additional subjects will be en rolled and treated in that cohort. Dose 
escalation to the next cohort may proceed if th ere is no more than one DLT in a cohort of 6 
subjects. 
3.4 Cohort Expansion  
If no DLT develops in 3 subjects in Cohort 5 (1.5 g/m

All subjects with aviremia and CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/µL will undergo a minimum 16-week 
TI. Subjects will be seen every other week (+/- 3 days) for th e first 8 weeks (weeks 6, 8, 10, 12, 
14) and then every month (+/- 1 week) for the remaining 8 weeks of the TI (weeks 18 and 22). 
(Section 8.3 ) 
Subjects will discontinue HAART under the supe rvision of the principal investigator. Non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase i nhibitors (NNRTI) such as Rescri ptor, Sustiva, Intelence, and 
Viramune have been reported to have a longer half life than nucleosid e reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors (NRTI). Therefore, to avoid s uboptimal drug exposure which may promote drug 
resistance, subjects on a NNRTI containing regimen should discon tinue the NNRTI seven days 
before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144459] (Taylor et al., 2007). The time of medication 
interruption is noted in medicati on records and CRFs. The TI begins  for an individual subject on 
the day that all antiretrovirals agents have been discontinued.  
The following procedures will be performed at each visit during the TI: 
1. Begin TI (discontinue all HAART) (Week 6) 
2. AE assessment 
3. Assessment of concomitant medications 
4. Vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pr essure, and weight) (Weeks 6 and 22 only) 
5. Chemistry (Weeks 6, 8, 12, 18, and 22 only) 
6. CBC with differential an d platelet count  
7. CD4+ T-cell (during the initial [ADDRESS_164417] will be repeated every 2 weeks for 
3 consecutive measurements for values <500 cells/µL) 
8. HIV-1 RNA (during the initial [ADDRESS_164418] will be repeated every 2 weeks for 
3 consecutive measurements for values >100,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL)

12. Research blood (Weeks 6, 14, and 22 only) 
At the end of the 16-week TI at Week 22: 
• HAART will be reinstituted in subjects w ith HIV RNA levels >10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and/or 
CD4 <500 cells/µL.    
• Subjects with HIV RNA levels ≤ 10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and CD4 count ≥ 500 cells/µL may 
elect to remain off HAART and undergo ex tended TI beyond 16-weeks (subjects with a 
VL that is below the limit of detection will remain off HAART). ( Section 8.3 )

g/m2), Cohort 3 (1.0 g/m2), Cohort 4 (2.0 g/m2), and Cohort 5 (1.5 g/m2).   
Subjects may be pre-medicated with acetam inophen 650 mg by [CONTACT_144519] (Benadryl) 25-50 mg by [CONTACT_144520] , prior to the infusion of cyclophosphamide. 
These medications may be repeated every 3-4 hours as needed.  
Antiemetics 
Recommended antiemetics such as Aloxi 0.25 mg IV and Emend 125 mg PO should be given 60 
minutes before cyclophosphamide followed by [CONTACT_144521] 80mg PO once a day for the following 6 days. Other antiemetic regimens may be given at  the discretion of the investigator and with 
sponsor consultation, if possible.  Subjects may be prescribed with an antiemetic (IV, oral or suppository) if nausea and vomiting develops during cyclophosphamide administration.  
Filgrastim 
After cyclophosphamide administrati on, if neutrophil count drops to ≤ 750/mm

level of expected CCR5 specific ZFN activity and is below the level induced by [CONTACT_104125], which 
blocks topoisomerase II leading to DNA breaks during cell division. No T cell transformation 
has been detected in a soft agar transformation a ssay, or in multiple animal biotoxicity studies in 
which each animal received greater than the equi valent of a human dose, and over all animals a 
log equivalent of a human dose was evaluated. Ta king this data together, there is currently no 
indication that SB-728 modifi ed T-cells is unsafe and may cause T-cell tumors.  
9.1.3 Replication Competent Adenovirus (RCA) 
The A5/F35 SB-728 vector used in this study is derived from the common cold adenovirus. SB-
728 is tested for presence of RCA and m
eets FDA specification of less than 1 RCA in 3 x 1010 
vector particles. The tropi[INVESTIGATOR_144468] v ector is that of Type B adenoviruses, and it is 
more efficient at transduci ng hematopoietic cells than th e more commonly used Type C 
adenovirus (Ad5).  
Previous experience has shown th at systemically distributed re plication competent adenovirus 
vectors (Ad5) induce elevated liv er enzymes at the dose of 6x1012 vector particles and that the 
lethal dose is 1x1014 vector particles when administered systemically (Small et al., 2006a). The 
current protocol will use approximately 6x1012 viral particles to transduce T-cells ex vivo.   
However, at the completion of the ex vivo T- cell culture expansions, there is a significant 
reduction of the level of adenovirus in the T-cells. Preclinical data indicate s that during the [ADDRESS_164441].  Previous studies with the intentional systemic administration of replication competent but 
selective adenovirus has shown ci rculating virus for up to 29 days at IV doses of  3 x10
 12 and 6 
x10 12 vector particles and, with the concomitant deve lopment of high levels of  neutralizing anti-
adenoviral antibodies in all subjects by [CONTACT_4475] 28. This was asso ciated with self limited and 
asymptomatic increases in liver function tests (Small et al., 2006b). There has been no evidence 
of hepatitis in the 35 subjects treated to date. N onetheless, subjects participating in the study will 
be monitored carefully for liver function abnormalitie s and signs or symptoms of hepatitis.  
Subjects in this study will be ev aluated for replication competen t adenovirus (by [CONTACT_1629] E1 gene 
PCR assay), as well as adenovi rus neutralizing antibody titers. Th e clearance of any adenovirus 
(whether replication deficient or  competent) should be quite rapid since most subjects will have 
preexisting antibodies to the Ad 5 penton base and hexon proteins.  
9.1.4 Immunogenicity 
The Ad5 fiber 35 vector util izes AD5 hexon and penton capsi d proteins and the AD 35 fiber 
capsid protein (Nilsson et  al. 2004). Pre-existing neutralizing anti bodies to Ad5, which is the 
most prevalent adenoviral serotype antibody in  m
an, could be reacti ve to SB-728-T (Aste-
Amezaga et al. 2004). After infusion of SB-728-T, all of the pati ents tested to date have 
developed elevated neutralizing adenovirus anti bodies.  There were no associated AEs.  In 
general, subjects with higher pre-existing antibo dy titer had a lower level of engraftment of SB-
728-T in peripheral blood as measured by [CONTACT_144525] a common CCR5 modification 
(pentamer assay, units = number of copi[INVESTIGATOR_144469]/1e6 genomes) compared to the subjects 
with low pre-existing antibody levels.

Cyclophosphamide is associated with a variety of si de effects. The adverse effects that occur at a 
frequency of >10% includes alopecia, infertility, nausea and vomiting, hemorrhagic cystitis and 
bone marrow suppression. Antiemetics will be given prophylactically and as needed for nausea 
and vomiting. Leukopenia is more common than thrombocytopenia and anemia with the onset [ADDRESS_164442] additional testing of CBC (with differential) , platelet count, and 
ANC on Day 5 and Day 12. After cyclophosphamide ad ministration, if neutrophil count drops to 
≤ 750/mm
3, administration of Filgrastim is recommended. Filgrastim can be discontinued when 
neutrophil count is ≥  1000/mm3. Subjects will be monitored, as needed, post cyclophosphamide 
administration. The majority of the adverse effect s require the administration of high cumulative 
doses of cyclophosphamide  (Section 1.2.2) . 
Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potential untoward effect of cyclophosphamide therapy with the metabolite acrolein implicated as the major urothelial toxin. The incidence of hemorrhagic 
cystitis was reported to be 6% among subj ects who received cyclophosphamide (1.0-1.2 g/m
2) 
for ovarian cancer. At these low doses, the Americ an Society of Clinical Oncology recommends 
administering fluids to induce a diuresis. In this study, subjects in Cohorts 1-[ADDRESS_164443] the study 
center immediately if hematuria (either  micro or macro) is detected.  
Cyclophosphamide is a carcinogen and has been associated with malignancies. The risk depends upon the dose administered, other co-administered chemotherapy, use of radiotherapy, treatment 
intensity and duration of therapy. Cumulative dose s totaling 10 g or less has been shown to be 
associated with an incidence of malignancy that  is similar to that of the normal untreated 
population (Baker et al., 1987). Therefore, the low doses (200 mg to 2.0 g/m
2) that will be 
administered in this study ar e unlikely to be  carcinogenic. 
9.3 HAART Treatment Interruption (TI) 
The efficacy and safety
 of HAART interruption for HIV patients has been reviewed by [CONTACT_144526] 
(Paton, 2008). Data indicates that th ere is no clinical benefit to pa tients with acute HIV infection 
or those with virologic failure due to multidrug resistance. Indeed, TI may be harmful in patients 
with chronic successfully treated infections. Therefore, TI is currently only recommended in the context of clinical trials. 
The safety of TI has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_144527]. In that study, 
six subjects had HAART interrupted beginning 4 weeks after receiving SB-728-T ( Table 9.3-1 ). 
Five of the subjects have completed the TI. HI V-RNA which was below the limit of detection at 
the time of the TI became detectable at 2 to 6 w eeks, peaking at 6 to 8 weeks and then declined 
at 12 weeks. In subjects 1, 2 and 6, the VL dropped 0.5- to 2- log within 4 to 6 weeks and 
declined after reinstitu ting HAART. The TI was halted in S ubjects 3 and 4 as per the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144470], Inc.

CD4 count drops to <500 cells/µL,  the tests will be repeated every 2 weeks for a total of 3 
consecutive measurements. HAART will be reinstitu ted in subjects whose CD4 cell counts drop 
to <500 cells/µL and/or whose HIV-RNA increases to >100,000 on three consecutive 
measurements. During extended TI, additional monitoring will be performed as needed for safety.  CD4 T-cell count will be repeated monthly for a total of 2 consecutive measurements if CD4 count <500 
cells/µL and HIV-1 RNA will be repeated monthly for a total of 3 consecutive 
measurements if HIV-1 RNA levels > 10,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/m L. In addition, all subjects infected with a 
CXCR4 virus will resume HAART. The effectivene ss of these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_144471] 3 and 4 in the PENN study cited above. 
It is possible that some patients could experien ce symptoms compatible with retroviral rebound 
syndrome, or rarely, other clinical events that occur before use of HAART (e.g. immune 
thrombocytopenia). The kinetics of viral rebound are well char acterized, typi[INVESTIGATOR_144472] 2 to 4 weeks following di scontinuation of drug, and viral replication is routinely re-
suppressed with resumption of therapy. 
The psychological risks associated with TI appear to be minimal.  In a survey reported at the 
2002 International AIDS Conference in Barcelon a, study investigators quizzed enrollees about 
their experience in the Spanish Swiss Intermittent  Treatment Trial, and found that the majority 
"viewed their experience positively." Only two stated they would not participate in a similar TI 
trial, compared to [ADDRESS_164447] initiated (Le Braz et 
al., 2002).

edical occurrence associat ed with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. The term “adverse event” could include any of  the following 
events which develop or increase in severity during the course of the study. Examples include: 
• Any sign, symptom, or physical examination fi nding that worsens in nature, severity, or 
frequency compared to baseline. Whether th ought to be related or unrelated to the 
condition under study 
• Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality  or laboratory abnormality that requires 
medication or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• All reactions from study drug, incl uding those occurring as a resu lt of an overdose, abuse, 
withdrawal phenomena, sensitivit y, or toxicity to study drug 
• Concurrent illness 
• Injury or accident 
A pre-existing condition is one that  is present prior to or at the start of the study and is to be 
reported as part of the subject’ s medical history.  It should be reported as an AE only if the 
frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition wors ens during study treatment. 
The term AE also applies to laboratory findings or results of other diagnostic procedures that are 
considered to be clinic ally relevant (e.g., that required un scheduled diagnostic procedures or 
treatment measures, or resulted in withdrawal from the study). 
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
Unexpected AE or Unexpected Suspected Adve rse Reaction:  An AE or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered “unexpected” if  it is not listed in the inves tigator brochure or  is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that  has been observed; or, if an i nvestigator brochure is not required 
or available, is not consistent with the risk in formation described in the general investigational 
plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  For example, under this definition, 
hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_144528]) if the investigator brochure 
referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or he patitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and 
cerebral vasculitis would be unexp ected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator 
brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  “U nexpected,” as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that  are mentioned in the investigator brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated  from the pharmacological properties of the drug, 
but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular dr ug under investigation.

Severity will be categorized by [CONTACT_144529] e according to the Division of AIDS Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), 
Version 1.0, December 2004, Clarification 1.0, August 2009 with the exception of the following: nausea or vomiting will be a Grade 3 non-hematolo gical AE if IV fluids are required for more 
than 24 hours.  AEs not listed in the DAIDS Clinical Trial Toxi city Criteria with the exception of noninfective 
cystitis will be evaluated by [CONTACT_88550]:  
• Grade 1, Mild: Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social & 
functional activities  
• Grade 2, Moderate:  Symptoms causing greater  than minimal interference with usual 
social & functional activities  
• Grade 3, Severe:  Symptoms causing inabilit y to perform usual social & functional 
activities 
• Grade 4, Potentially Life-threatening: Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions OR medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent 
impairment, persistent disability, or death  
• Grade 5: For any AE where the outcome is death. 
Noninfective cystitis will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 with the following criteria:  
• Grade 1: Microscopic hematuria; minimal in crease in frequency, urgency, dysuria, or 
nocturia; new onset of incontinence   
• Grade 2:  Moderate hematuria; moderate  increase in freque ncy, urgency, dysuria, 
nocturia or incontinence; urinary catheter placement or bladder irrigation indicated; limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
• Grade 3:  Gross hematuria; transfusion, IV medications or  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374]; 
elective endoscopic, radiologic or operative intervention indicated  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urge nt radiologic or ope rative intervention 
indicated 
• Grade 5: Death 
The relationship of the AE to the investigat ional drug will be determined by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_144475]:  
• Not Related : Any AE that does not meet the defi nition of a suspect ed AE reaction.

11.2 Definitions of a Serious Adverse Event 
Any AE or
 suspected adverse reaction is consider ed “serious” ” if, in th e view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results  in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• A life-threatening AE 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed patient 
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator, or sponsor, its occu rrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspec ted adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death).

 APPENDIX II: DIVISION OF AIDS TABLE FOR GRADING THE SEVERITY OF 
ADULT AND PEDIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
Version 1.0, December, 2004; clarification August 2009 
 
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS AE Grading Table”) is a descriptive terminology which can be utilized for Adverse 
Event (AE) reporting. A grading (severity)  scale is provided for each AE term. 
 
This clarification of the DAIDS Table for Grad ing the Severity of A dult and Pediatric AE’s 
provides additional explanation of the DAIDS AE Grading Table and clarifies some of the parameters.  
 
I. INSTRUCTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS  
Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs
 
The DAIDS AE Grading Table includes parameters  for grading both Adult and Pediatric AEs.  
When a single set of parameters is not appropr iate for grading specifi c types of AEs for both 
Adult and Pediatric populations, separate sets  of parameters for Adult and/or Pediatric 
populations (with specified respec tive age ranges) are given in th e Table.  If there is no 
distinction in the Table between Adult and Pediatric values for a type of AE, then the single set 
of parameters listed is to be used for grading th e severity of both Adult and Pediatric events of 
that type.   
Note: In the classification of advers e events, the term “severe” is not  the same as 
“serious.” Severity is an indication of the intensity  of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe chest pain).  The term  “serious” relates to a participant/event 
outcome or action criteria , usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
participant’s life or functioning.  
 
Addenda 1-[ADDRESS_164479], male genital 
area or rectum, strong considera tion should be given to using Appendices I-III as the primary 
grading scales for these areas. The protocol would need to specifically state that one or more of 
the Appendices would be primary (and thus take precedence over the main Grading Table) for items that are listed in both the Appendix and the main Grading Table. 
Addendum 1 - Female Genital Grading Ta ble for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF
 
Addendum 2 - Male Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF  
Addendum 3 - Rectal Grad ing Table for Use in Microbicide Studies - PDF  
 Grade 5
 
For any AE where the outcome is death, the sever ity of the AE is classified as Grade 5.  
 Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Table
 
In order to grade a c linical AE that is not  identified in the DAIDS AE grading table, use the 
category “Estimating Severity Grade” located on Page 3.

Page 52 of 70                                                                                   Version: January 30, 2014 
  
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters “Between Grades”  
If the severity of a clinical AE  could fall under either one of two grades (e.g., the severity of an 
AE could be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select  the higher of the two gr ades for the AE. If a 
laboratory value that is graded as a multiple of the ULN or LLN falls between two grades, select 
the higher of the two grades for the AE. For example, Grade [ADDRESS_164480] (which is between the two grades), the 
severity of this AE would be Gr ade 2, the higher of the two grades. 
 
Values Below Grade [ADDRESS_164481].  For example: Phosphate, Serum, Low, Adult and Pediatric > 14 years Grade 1 range is 2.50 
mg/dL - < LLN. A particular la boratory’s normal range for Phos phate is 2.1 – 3.8 mg/dL. A 
participant’s actual lab value is 2.5.   In this case, the value of 2.[ADDRESS_164482] for the local 
lab, but will be graded as Grade 1 per DAIDS AE Grading Table.

 4.0 Introduction  
 Study  Disease  
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) consist of a spectrum of malignancies that can arise from 
neuroendocrine cells throughout the body. They  are currently classified as well differentiated 
(low-grade to intermediate -grade) NETs and poorly differentiated or HGNET based on 
morphology and the proliferation rate. [1] NETs are rare tumors with an incidence of 3.5 -
5/100000 per year [2] and HGNETs account for about 10% to 20% of malignant digestive 
NETs. [3] HGNETs are defined as tumors with poorly differentiated morphology and a higher 
proliferation rate (Ki67 > 20%) than well differentiated NETs. They are characterized by  a 
high proclivity for metastatic dissemination even among patients with clinically localized 
tumors. [4] Well and poorly differentiated NETs are grouped together in the general class of 
NET only because of generic neuroendocrine marker expression (ie, detection of 
synaptophysin and/or chromogranin by [CONTACT_9064]). [5]  
Recent molecular discoveries have led to therapeutic advances in well differentiated NETs 
with the approval of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626009]. [6] In contrast, much 
less is known about HGNETs, and no prospective studies have evaluated HGNETs 
originating outside of the lung. These are aggressive carcinomas that typi[INVESTIGATOR_93177] a 
late stage and have a dismal median overall survival of only 10 mon ths.[2] To date, and even 
for the current standard of care regimen, no  prospective trial has been conducted to guide 
treatment for this disease and current treatment recommendations are extrapolated from the 
small cell lung cancer literature .[7] These  are generally managed with platinum -based 
chemotherapy with a modest PFS (4months) and OS (11 months) benefit. [7-11] After first -
line treatment, no further standard therapy has been established for HGNETs. No prospective 
trials have been conducted and a few small, retrospective, studies with chemotherapy 
(temozolamide, oxaliplatin, taxanes etc.) have quoted a response rate between 0-20% in the 
second line setting and <5% in the third line setting [11-14]. The responses, however, are of 
short duration. Data p ertaining to histologic classification and tumor biology are also 
extremely limited making the care of patients with this disease entity a significant challenge. 
Prospective studies evaluating potential treatment options with associated correlative studies  
to better understand the histologic and molecular features of these carcinomas are therefore 
desperately needed.  
 
  Agent under Investigation/intervention  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic  
transformation has been known for decades [15]. Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation b etween tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable 
prognosis in various malignancies [16-20]. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and 
the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to cor relate with 
improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors.  
 
The PD -[ADDRESS_834134] hijacked by [CONTACT_532774]. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
Tcells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune  
responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig

11 
 superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively  
regulate ant igen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) 
[21, 22]. The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [23]. PD-1 and family members 
are type I transmembrane glycop roteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of 
signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling 
motifs, an immunorece ptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine based switch motif (ITSM). Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the 
tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, 
leading to the dephos phorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 
which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [22, 24-26]. The mechanism by 
[CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_834135] from that of CTLA -
4 as both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [27, 28]. PD-1 was 
shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -
cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells [29, 30]. Expression has also been shown 
during thymic development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of 
macrophages and dendritic cells [31]. The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -
hematopoietic tissu es as well as in va rious tumors [28, 32-34]. Both ligands are type I 
transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular 
regio n and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of 
either PD -[ADDRESS_834136] notab ly on 
vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments. PD -L2 is 
thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to 
dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues [28]. Although healthy organs 
express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant 
levels of this T -cell inhibitor. PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell 
expansion in subjects with renal cell carcinoma [35]. This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway plays a cri tical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Pembrolizumab  (MK-3475 ), previously 
known as SCH 900475 , is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) of the IgG4/kapp a isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 
and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.

  Study Rationale   
Immune checkpoint blockade i s a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_626010] -oncology and treatment with investigational agents targeting this mechanism has

(AEs) are gener ally manageable in patients. They have shown activity in wide range of

12 
 malignancies including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and lung cancer, and more data is 
emerging by [CONTACT_253898]. [36-38] No published studies have evaluated PD -L1 expression in high 
grade NET. In SCLC,  PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is reported to be low (0 -27%) b ut 
18.5% show PD -L1 expression in tumor -infiltrating macrophages a nd 48% harbor PD-1 
positive lymphocytes. [39, 40] Immune checkpoint blockers  have not been studied in NETs 
but are being actively investigated  in SCLC  and Merkel Cell Carcinoma  with promising 
results . In a recently reported int erim analysis of a study using Nivolumab+/ - Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_626011], researchers reported a partial response in 15% 
and stable disease (SD) in 22.5% patients. In the combination arm, complete response was 
seen in 5%, partia l response in 20% and stable disease in 30% patients. [41] In the 
KEYNOTE -028 study, rate of PD -L1 positivity in small cell lung  cancer was found to be 
around 27%. In the cohort of 17 evaluable patients treated with pembrolizumab, there were 
no treatment -related deaths or discontinuations due to AEs. 25% patients had a partial 
response and 7% had stable disease, resulting in a dise ase control rate of 31%. [40] 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) In the initial phase I  study of Pembrolizumab, a patient  with Merkel cell 
carcinoma experienced complete responses of 56+ weeks' duratio n[42]. This led to the phase 
II study  in advanced merkel cell carcinoma  where the objective response rate with 
pembrolizumab was 71%, which included a complete response in 2 of 14 patients [43]. The 
drug is currently being investigated  as a first line therapy for patients with locally 
advanced/metastatic merkel cell carcinoma. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Both t hese tumor types (small 
cell lung cancer and merkel cell carcinoma) are thought to be of neuroendocrine lineage and 
are treated similarly with frontline platinum/etoposide combinatio ns, just like other high 
grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. The impressive a ctivity of pembrolizumab in these 
tumors, presents a strong argument for investigating its role in HGNETs.  
 
Snyder et.al.described the importance of tumor genetics in defining the basis of the clinical 
benefit from checkpoint blockade. In their study, muta tional load correlated with improved 
overall survival and response to immunotherapy [44]. Preliminary d ata from our in -house 
IRB approved study, that utilized an NGS platform to detect somatic mutations in 50 cancer -
related genes on archived tissue, found a staggering 77% (16/21) rate of mutations in the 
HGNETs with 44% of the tumors having more than one mu tation (on the limited 50 gene 
panel). We enrolled 21 patients with HGNETs over 15 months in this study. [45] This 
provides anothe r rationale for testing pembrolizumab in HGNETs.  
 
As discussed in section 4.1, after first -line treatment, no further standard therapy has been 
established for HGNETs. Several  small, retrospective, studies with chemotherapy 
(temozolamide, oxaliplatin, taxanes etc.) have quoted short lived responses  after the first line 
setting.  
In summary, t he lack of second line treatment options for HGNETs highlights the unmet 
need for drug development in this rare tumor type. The higher mu tational load exhibited by 
[CONTACT_626028], a highly selective, 
humanized monoclonal antibody against PD -1, in HGNE Ts with respect to efficacy  and 
toxicity. Therefore, we propose a phase II, open -label study of pembrolizumab monotherapy

Version Date 03/03/[ADDRESS_834137] an acceptable safety 
profile when given as a single agent to patients with metastatic, HGNETs.  
 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regi men/Modification  
Previously, an open -label Phase I trial ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) was conducted to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent Pembrolizumab (MK -3475).  The dose escalation portion 
of the trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/ kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 
2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of 
pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engag ement and objective evidence of tumor size 
reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been 
identified to date.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the pembrolizumab program 
has shown that a lower dose of pembr olizumab and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient 
for target engagement and clinical activity.  
  
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer t o IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale 
for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacoki netic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time 
data from [ADDRESS_834138] a wide 
therapeutic  range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 
mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated 
to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab in 
the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy 
and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W 
(i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed t hat there was 
no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was  similar 
between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes 
in exposure between different indication settings.  
 
The rationale for  further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of  Pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors was  based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of Pembrolizumab when dosed at 
either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response 
relationshi ps of Pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg 
Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution

14 
 behavior of Pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption  
that the dynamics of Pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with 
tumor type.  
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulations performed using the population PK model of Pembroli zumab showing that 
the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally 
consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain 
individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in me lanoma as associated 
with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the 
exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenie nt for 
physicians and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also 
reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 
 Rationale for endpoints  
4.6.1.  Primary endpoint  
The primary efficacy objective of this trial is to evaluate the anti -tumor activity of 
pembrolizumab (MK -3475) (200 mg Q3W) monotherapy in subjects with previously 
treated metastatic high grade neuroendocrine tumors. Objective response rate (ORR) based 
on RECIST 1.1 will be used as the pri mary efficacy endpoint.  Secondary endpoints in this 
study is progression free survival (per RECIST 1.1) , and overall survival.  
 
4.6.2.  Safety  Endpoint  
The safety endpoint in this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of 
Pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated metastatic  high grade neuroendocrine 
tumors . Adverse events and laboratory test values observed in this study are also safety 
endpoints. The primary safety ana lysis will be based on subjects who experienced toxicities  
requiring discontinuation of therapy  as defined by [CONTACT_760] (section 7.0). Safety will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_626029] (MK -3475), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and events 
of clinical interest (ECIs).  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_626030], Version 4.0. The  attribution to drug, time -of-onset, duration of the event, its 
resolution, a nd any concomitant  medications administered will be recorded. AEs will be 
analyzed including but not limited to all AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes. 
Furthermore, specific immune -related  adverse events (irAEs) will be collected and 
designated a s immune -related events of clinical interest (ECIs) as described in Section

 Rationale for Correlative Testing  
We will a ssess the expression level of PD -1, PD -L1 and PD -L2 and Tumor Infiltrating 
Lymphocytes  (TIL) content  in tumor samples and its co rrelation with response to 
investigational therapy . Initial studies suggest that baseline PD -L1 tumor cell expression

Version Date 03/03/[ADDRESS_834139] strongly correl ated with response to PD -1 blockade. 
Biopsy specimen analysis will endeavor to serve this question in HGNETs. We will utilize 
archived tumor tissue to perform the analysis and patients without available archived 
tissue;  may undergo a n optional fresh biopsy  at enrollment . Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) will be evaluated by H&E immunohistochemical staining.  Guided by [CONTACT_626031] (section 4.4 -study rationale) [45], mutational analysis of tumors using 
next gen sequencing platform will be conducted to identify predictive biomarkers and 
guide future therapy beyond checkpoint inhibitors.  
 
Additionally, using peripheral blood samples, we will asse ss PD -[ADDRESS_834140] in identifying patients likely to respond 
to PD -1 blocking antibodies.

 Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.5 –
Rationale.   
Details  on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab (MK -3475) are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual .  
 
 Dose Administration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/  
assessments have been completed as detailed on the study calendar  (Section 10.0).  Trial 
treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle 
due to administrative reasons.  All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Pembrolizumab  will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion (treatment cycle intervals 
may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 7.0).  Sites should make every effort 
to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given th e

 variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -10 minutes and +10 minutes is 
permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -10 min/+10 min).  
 
The following infusion set materials are compatible with (pembrolizumab):  
•      PVC Infusion set  that is plasticized using DEHP  
•      PVC and tri -(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TOTM) infusion set  
•      Polyethylene lined PVC infusion set  
•      PVC Infusion set that is plasticized using Di -2-ethylhexyl Terephthalate (DEHT)  
•      Polyurethane set.  
 
A sterile, non -pyrogenic, low -protein binding 0.2 to 5 µm in -line filter made of 
polyethersulfone (PES) must be used during administration to remove any adventitious 
particles.  If the infusion set does not contain 0.2 to 5 µm in -line filter, it is recommen ded to 
use 0.2 to 5 µm add -on filter which may contain an extension line.  Attach the infusion line 
to the pump and prime the line, either with normal saline (at least 25 mL) or with infusion 
solution as per local SOP, before starting the infusion.  Infuse p embrolizumab (MK -3475) 
over approximately 30 minutes, with a window of -10 and +[ADDRESS_834159] ing to institutional guidelines for saline 
flushing.  Document volume administered according to data entry guidelines.  Vital signs will 
be monitored every 15 minutes during the infusion and at 60 minutes after completion of 
each infusion. In case of infusio n reactions, infusion rate may differ; refer to protocol for 
specific instructions.  
  
Whenever possible, the lowest infusion rate should be used that will allow completion of the 
infusion within the 30 minutes. Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6. 7 mL/min. 
through a peripheral line or indwelling catheter. However, when it is necessary to infuse a 
larger volume (i.e. 250 mL), the flow rate may go as high as 10 mL/min (maximum) in order 
to keep the infusion within the window as defined above  
 
 Concomi tant Medications, Supportive Care, Excluded Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626012]. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccinati on 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may 
be required. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the  
investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
 
6.4.1.  Acceptable Con comitant Medications  
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be  
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] w ith the community standards 
of medical care. All concomitant medication  received within [ADDRESS_834160] dose of trial treatment,  will be recorded on the case 
report form (CRF)  including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements,

 and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of 
drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. Patients may 
receive supportive blood products or antibiotics when appropriate.  Patients requiring other 
support ive or adjunctive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including but not limited to percutaneous drainage or 
biliary or genitourinary stent placement, may be considered on an individual patient basis to 
be permitted to hold investigational therapy for up to 42 days. Palliative radi ation therapy is 
permitted for irradiating small areas of painful metastases (bony, or otherwise) or bleeding 
from a solitary site that cannot be managed adequately using systemic or local analgesics, as 
long as the treating clinician feels the patient is otherwise clinically benefitting and would 
more likely than not continue to garner benefit at the conclusion of this localized therapy.  
 
Concomitant medications administered after [ADDRESS_834161] dose of trial treatment 
should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 9.0. 
6.4.2.  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626013]:  
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
 Radiati on therapy   
Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion .   
 Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_834162] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial.   Examples  of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, 
the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, 
and typhoid vaccine.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical  interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  
Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be medically 
necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this trial.

 6.4.3.  Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_78017].  Suggested supportive care measures for the man agement of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in 
appendix  (section 1 7.3). Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or 
intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses 
of stero id tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is 
decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as 
metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportiv e 
care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines 
the events to be related to Pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator may 
follow the AE reporting g uidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as 
outlined in appendix  17.3). Refer to section 7.0 for dose modification.   
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of ev aluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as 
appropriate, can be found in the ECI guidance document.  
Pneumonitis :  
• For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
• Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolo nged 
steroid administration.  
Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal s igns and ileus).   
 
• All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
• For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis  that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
• For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1 week, treat with i ntravenous steroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.

 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or  ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis 
(DKA)  
 
• Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus  and for Grade 
3-4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
• Evaluate  patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
Hypophysitis : 
 
• For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and contin ued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones 
may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated 
based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
 
• Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 3 -4 hypothyroidism):  
o In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are suggested as 
initial therapy.  
o In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or 
liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of c are. 
 
• Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
o Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued 
over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate  hormones may be required 
as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
Hepatic : 
• For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
o Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
Renal Failure or Nephritis :

 • For Grade 2  events, treat with corticoste roids.  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion 
of infusion.  Table 2 below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an 
infusion reaction associated with administration of Pembrolizumab.

 Diet/ Activity /Other Considerations  
6.5.1.   Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE 
such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
 
6.5.2.  Contraception  
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not known 
if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of s perm.   
For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non -reproductive potential if they 
have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).   
 
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproducti ve potential if they are either:  
 
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 
months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR 
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy,  bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176715]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prio r to screening;  
OR 
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
 
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming  pregnant 
or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for  [ADDRESS_834164] dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:   
(1) practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR 
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.   
 
Acceptable m ethods of contraception are‡: 
  
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
  
Combination method (requires use of two of t he following):

 • diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap w ith spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot  be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870] -
only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contrace ptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous 
contraceptive injection  
  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual life style and 
if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.   
  
‡If a contraceptive  method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it 
does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites 
in this country/region.  
 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to 
participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception 
requirement (described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior 
to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up 
to [ADDRESS_834165]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated.  The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_006] without delay and 
within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006]  if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, 
abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the 
mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the ou tcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to  [COMPANY_006] .   If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately 
and the pregnancy reported to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described above and in section 9.2. 
6.5.4.  Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are 
excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the 
nursing infant, subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.

 Participant Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Participants may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial 
at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur .  In addition, a 
participant may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_626034], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  
Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal are p rovided in section 8.4 – Other 
Procedures.  
A participant must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
 The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws 
consent.  
 Disease progression (for definition s ee Section1 2 ) 
 Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 7.0 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
 Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
 The participant has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
 Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
 The subject is lost to follow -up 
 Completed 3 5 cycles of treatment with pembrolizumab   
Note: Subjects who stop pembrolizumab  after 3 5 cycles may be eligible for up to 18 
cycles of additional study treatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_626014] 8.5.4 . 
 Administrative reasons  
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedur es are listed in Section 10 (Study 
calendar ) and Section 8.5 (Visit Requirements).  After the end of treatment, each subject will 
be followed for 120 days for adverse event monitoring (events of clinical interest will be 
collected for 120 days after the en d of treatment).  Subjects who discontinue for reasons other 
than progressive disease will have post -treatment follow -up for disease status until disease 
progression, initiating a non -study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent or becoming lost 
to follow -up.  After documented disease progression each subject will be followed by 
[CONTACT_80075], withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, 
whichever occurs first. 
 Discontinuation of Study Therapy after CR  
Discontinuation of trea tment may be considered for subjects who have attained a confirmed 
CR that have been treated for at least [ADDRESS_834166] two 
 
Copyright© 201 6 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Clinical Trials Operations.  All rights reserved.  
Version Date 03/03/[ADDRESS_834167] meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion 
criteria, and the trial is open.  Subjects will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule 
at the time of initial discontinuation.  Additional details are provided in Section 8.5. 
 
 Treatment beyond  Disease Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab (MK -3475) may produce antitumor  
effects by [CONTACT_626035] -specific immune responses, which may be  
functionally exhausted. The response patterns seen with such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626015], and can manifest a clinical  
response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions.  
Standard RECIST criteria may n ot provide an accurate or complete response assessment of  
immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab (MK -3475). Data from previous trials has 
clearly demonstrated a phenomenon in which patients treated with PD -1 inhibitors may 
derive clinical benefit d espi[INVESTIGATOR_626016] [46].Therefore, RECIST 1.1 will be used with the following adaptation:  
If radiologic imaging by [CONTACT_5737]/site assessment shows PD, tumor assessment may be repeated  
> 4 weeks  later in order to confirm PD with the  option of continuing treatment per  below 
while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. If repeat imaging shows SD,  PR or 
CR, treatment may be continued as per treatment calendar. If repeat imaging still  meets the 
threshold for PD (≥ 20% increase in tumor burden compared to nadir) but shows a  reduction 
in tumor burden compared to the previous time point, treatment may be continued  as per 
treatment calendar after consultation with Sponsor  Investigator . If repeat imaging confirms  
progressive disease without reduction in tumor burden compared to the previous time point,  
subjects will be discontinued from study therapy. In determining whether or not the tumor  
burden has increased or decreased, investigators should consider all target lesions as well as  
non-target lesions.  
 
The decision to continue study treatment after the 1st evidence of disease progression is at  
the Investigator’s discretion based on the clinical status of the subject a s described in 
Section 8.5.5.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_834168] es  
Dose modifications will be made based only on the guidelines described in Section 7.0.  
Patients requiring treatment to be held > [ADDRESS_834169] discontinue 
protocol treatment.  Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with 
Pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events 
may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment. 
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and severe or life -threatening 
AEs as per Table 3 below. See Section 6.4 (Supportive Care Guidelines) , Table 2 and

9.0 Adverse Events  
 Definitions : 
9.1.1.  Adverse Events  
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (in cluding an abnormal laboratory finding, for 
example), symptom, or disease  temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product 
or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
or protocol -specified procedure .   
 
Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or 
intensity) of a preexisting conditi on that is temporally associated with the use of the 
pembrolizumab  is also an adverse event.  
 
Changes resulting from normal growth and  development that do not vary significantly in 
frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be con sidered adverse events.  
Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_460119] o r menopause occurring at a physiologically appropriate time . 
 
9.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that is fatal or life threatening, requires inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] (for > 24 hours), pe rsistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, or results in any important medical 
event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above 
outcomes.  A “life -threatening” adverse event places the patient  at immediate risk of death 
in the judgment of the investigator or sponsor.  
 
Note: In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting eith er of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are considered serious for the purpose of this study 
and therefore must be reported in the same timeframe as SAEs.  
●  Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
●  Is associated with an overdose.

 9.1.3.  Definition of Overdose for This Protocol  
For purposes of this trial, an  overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 
1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on 
the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided if clinica lly indicated.  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed 
closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if 
clinically indicated.  
 
9.1.4.   Severity Rating  
The investigator will evaluate the severity of each adve rse event.  NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.0) or study specific toxicity tables 
provided in the protocol define severity.  If not included in CTCAE v.4.0, severity is 
expressed in numerical grade using the following definitio ns: 
1. Grade 1: Mild -asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2. Grade 2: Moderate -minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age appropriate instrumental ADL.  
3. Grade 3: Severe -severe  or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; 
limiting self care ADL . 
4. Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.   
5. Grade 5: Death related to AE  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Attribution/Relationship to study drug  
1. Definite – clearly related  
2. Probable – likely related  
3. Possible – may be related  
4. Unlikely – doubtfully related  
5. Unrelated – clearly not related  
 
9.1.5.  Expectedness  
An Expected Adverse Event is one where the specificity  or severity is consistent with the 
current information available from the resources.  
An Unexpected Adverse Event is one where the nature, severity, or frequency of the event 
is related to participation in the research is not consistent with either:

9.1.6.  Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinic al 
Interest (ECI) .  
 
Events of clinical interest for this trial include:  
1.  An overdose of [COMPANY_006] product that  is not associated with clinical symptoms or 
abnormal laboratory results.  
2.  an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit 
of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X 
the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that 
is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by w ay of protocol -specified 
laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may 
require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.   
 
 Assessing, Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
 
9.2.1.  Investigative site recording responsibilities:  
 
1. Upon identification of an AE or SAE, the site investigator will utilize the above 
definitions to properly classify the event.  Each category listed above;  in section 9.1; 
must be recorded for each event.  Adverse events will be recorded from the time of 
treatment initiation through 120 days following cessation of treatment.  
 
2. All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the “AE case report forms” (CRF) and in progress 
reports with details about the grade and attribution of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], action taken with 
respec t to the study drug, and the patient’s outcome will be recorded in the CRF.  All 
events will be recorded on case report forms for the duration of the study until they 
resolve.  
 
3. All SAEs will be recorded on the FDA MedWatch form 3500a.  After submitting the  
initial report it may be necessary to submit follow up reports to the Sponsor, [COMPANY_006] and 
the FDA should the event require further investigation.  
 
9.2.2.  Investigative site reporting responsibilities:  
1. The investigator/ site is responsible to report all SAEs that occur on or after the first day 
of study treatment to the IST Regulatory Specialist within 24 hours of becoming aware 
 
Copyright© 201 6 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Clinical Trials Operations.  All rights reserved.  
Version Date 03/03/[ADDRESS_834192] be 
sent email to [EMAIL_11608].   
 
2. If the investigator or IRB feels the event warrants a revision to the informed consent that 
was not already initiated by [CONTACT_610165], draft revisions will be made in track changes and 
submitted to the OCR for consideration.  Any consent revisions must receive OCR 
approval prior  to submi ssion to the IRB.  
 
3. Any investigator who is in doubt of whether a particular AE needs to be reported is 
directed to call the Study Monitor for confirmation with the Sponsor Investigator . 
 
4. If the results of an investigator or OCR investigation show an advers e event not initially 
determined to be reportable is so reportable, the investigator will report the event 
following the above guidelines based on the date the determination is made.

Version Date 03/03/17  
42 
 If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a pembrolizumab , 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met . 
 
If a dose of pembrolizumab  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without 
any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported 
as a non -seriou s Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or 
intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
 
 New cancer Incident  
If a new type of cancer is detected, which is not a condition of the study, it should be 
reported as a serious adve rse event.  
 
 Pregnanc ies and Lactations  
Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment initiation through [ADDRESS_834194] be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, int rauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.  
 
 Events of Clinical In terest ( ECIs) 
For the time period beginning at treatment initiation through [ADDRESS_834195] be reported.  
 
9.2.4.  Sponsor  Reporting Responsibilities:  
1. Adverse events which meet all of the following criteria must be reported to all 
participating institutions for IRB submission within 2 weeks of notification of the 
event:

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)   
 
Copyright© 201 6 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Clinical Trials Operations.  All rights reserved.  
Version Date 03/03/17  
50 
 The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria will be used for 
object ive tumor response assessment. Assessments will be performed after  every [ADDRESS_834207] their response 
classified accor ding to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective 
disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that 
are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least 
one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable 
for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or 
unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_834208] x -
ray, as >[ADDRESS_834209] scan  or MRI , or >[ADDRESS_834210] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not b e 
considered measurable.    
 
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >[ADDRESS_834211] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are consid ered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.

Version Date 03/03/17  
51 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It 
may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it self to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calcu lated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in  the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.   Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded  in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same  technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessa ble by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin l esions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
CT and MRI   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_834212] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).

Version Date 03/03/[ADDRESS_834213], spatial, and temporal res olution; however, there are many 
image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  
As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the tech nical specifications of the scanning sequences 
used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as 
with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measur ed/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of 
the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and 
the image acquisi tion protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  
Body  scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -
CT is not al ways of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  
However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of 
identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of t he PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if  it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
 Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as  reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that 
is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or mor e 
new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis   
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for 
a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.

Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more n ew lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally 
trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a 
single lesion increase.

   Objective response rate (ORR ) 
Objective response rate (ORR ) is defined as the proportion of subjects with metastatic high 
grade NETs who achieve a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) using the RECIST1.[ADDRESS_834214] as either CR or PR and will be calculated as percentage CR + PR.   
 
 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the ti me measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taki ng as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
Progression -Free Survival : Progression free survival  is defined as the duration of time from 
start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.   
Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discon tinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

13.0 Statistical Considerations  
 Study Design/Endpoints  
The primary objective will be measured by [CONTACT_626042] e 
(per RECIST 1.1) among all treated subjects. Secondary endpoints include PFS (per RECIST 
1.1) and OS. As discussed in the background, no second line treatments have been studied 
prospectively for high grade neuroendocrine carcinomas and small retrospecti ve studies have 
shown dismal results with chemotherapy [11-13]. Hence we decided to proceed with a single 
stage statistical design given minimal i f any, harm associated with ineffective th erapy to 
study participants.  
 
A proportion of patients with favorable response less than 5.0% will be of no interest. The 
investigational agent would be of interest if the ORR is at least 20.0%. Estimates are based 
on historical controls from published dat a {Hentic, 2012 #70;Olsen, 2012 #71; {Sorbye, 2013 
#36} . Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for response. (Note:  Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) Patients who are not evaluable for 
response will be replaced. However, all patients who received at least [ADDRESS_834215] the 
null hypothesis: p <= 0.[ADDRESS_834216] the alternative hypothesis: p >= 0.20 at the 8.5% level of 
significance and with 82.1% power.  After 21 patients are evaluated if 3 or more patients 
with favorable response are observed then th e null hypothesis is rejected.  
 
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58106]/adverse events:   
 
Adverse events will be assessed continuously throughout the study. If [ADDRESS_834217] to discontinue study treatment due to treatment related adverse events the study 
will be suspended and early termination for excess  toxicity will be considered after careful 
investigation of the causes of the higher than expected toxicities. Once the root of the higher 
than anticipated toxicities has been determined, the study team will confer with the FCCC 
DSMC and IRB to make a dete rmination whether accrual can be resumed or the study will 
be terminated early . The chance of early termination with a true toxicity of 50% is 61%. The 
chance of early termination in error, when true toxicity is <20% is 1.9%. The overall chance 
of study te rmination under the null of 20% true toxicity is 2.7% and is 8 3% if true toxicity is 
50%. 
 
As discussed earlier, no second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626020] [11-13]. Hence we decided to proceed without a definite  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_626021] f utility, given minimal if any, harm associated with ineffective therapy to study 
participants. ]

 Correlative studies:  Due to this limited sample size, all exploratory analyses of associations 
of biomarkers with outcomes and changes in marker levels pre - and during treatment will 
be largely descriptive in nature.  
 
 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
We plan to accrue  21 eligible patients. The expected monthly accrual rate is 1 -2 patients. 
Thus, accrual is anticipated to take approximately 2 years.  
 
 Stratification Factors  
No stratification factors are pre -defined within the protocol  
 
 Reporting and Exclusions  
13.4.1 Evaluation of toxicity : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time 
of their first treatment with pembrolizumab  
 
13.4.2 Evaluation of response :  All patients included in the study must be assessed for 
response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if 
they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following 
categories:  1) complete response , 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) 
progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from 
toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_626043] n, category 9 usually 
designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of 
those who received no study medication) should be included in the main 
analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_834218] a treatment failure (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect 
treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the 
analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories [ADDRESS_834219] accrual.  All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reviewed on a real time basis 
first by [CONTACT_43038] y site PI [INVESTIGATOR_626022].

 Collection, Shipment, and Processing of Blood Sample s and Tissue for 
Correlative studies  
Optional b lood collection and storage of leftover tumor tissue sample for future 
exploratory research will be done only after obtaining informed consent from patients for 
future unspecified biomedical research . This consent will be a part of the informed 
consent process at the time of study entry.  
 
Blood Sample Collection:    
Three peripheral blood samples (up to 60 ml each) will be serially collected from each 
patient at the following time points:  
1. Immediately prior to the first treatment, for a baseline assessment.  
2. Immediately prior to the third treatment, which would occur at cycle 3.  
3. When disease progression is observed, either dur ing or post -treatment.  
 
Instructions for Collection, Processing and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_626025] a physician, registered nurse or licensed phlebotomist prior to 
receiving the Pembrolizumab at the predefined tim e points. For correlative studies, blood 
will be drawn into two (2) sodium heparin green top tubes  (about 20 ml) at the three 
time points. Also, one (1) red top tube and one (1) EDTA tube for cell free plasma (20 
ml) will be draw n before cycle 1 , every other assessment,  and at the end of treatment for 
future research.   
All blood samples for PBMC preparation will be processed in the Protocol Support 
Laboratory. Flow cytometry processing and analysis will be performed in the Campbell 
laboratory on an Aria II flow cytometer (BD). Compensation (parallel controls using cells 
singly stained for each color) and data analysis will be performed using FlowJo flow 
cytometry analysis software (TreeStar). The percentage and/or mean fluorescence 
intensity (MFI) of cell s staining for individual markers will be determined, and 
CD107A+ degranulating NK cells in functional assays, will be compared to isotype 
controls to establish baseline values. Pembrolizumab  will be used to stain for PD -1 
expression on leukocytes in pre -treatment samples and a secondary anti -human IgG4 will 
be used to assess the remaining Pembrolizumab  bound to PD -1 on treatment samples.  
Samples should be collected according to the institutional procedures for venipuncture.  
 
Archival tissue or biopsy  - Tissue will be used for immunohistochemistry  and next gene 
sequencing . If archival tissue is not available a n optional  biopsy may be performed. ” 
Label slides with patient study #, pathology accession #.  Slides will be prepared by [CONTACT_626046] 4oC, batche d and transferred to Qualtek  for immunohistochemistry analysis.  
 
PBMC preparation  (green top tubes) –  
 
Remaining PBMC will be frozen in 10%DMSO + 90% FBS at a conc. of 5 -10 x 106 
cells/vial and stored at –70oC and transferred to liquid nitrogen.

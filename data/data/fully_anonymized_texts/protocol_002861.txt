2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a debilitating condition that is caused by [CONTACT_220999], delivery or activity of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate needed for normal digestion and is 
commonly associated with a wide range of chronic diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic 
pancreatitis (CP), and pancreatic cancer. There are approximately 190,000 patients in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) managing their EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220980] (PERT).1
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is the cornerstone of EPI [CONTACT_3148].  Without PERT, patients 
may suffer from maldigestion and malabsorption and associated consequences, such as weight loss, 
malnutrit ion and sarcopenia.2-4  Pancrelipase delayed -release (DR) capsules is a PERT currently approved 
and marketed in the US by [CONTACT_221000] ® for the treatment of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220981], CP, pancreatectomy or 
other conditions.5Currently approved and marketed Creon is manufactured using a ctive pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API) produced at .
In order to protect Creon 'ssupply chain through site and geographic diversity, [COMPANY_013] invested in new 
equipment and manufacturin g site expansion to replicate the manufacturing process for pancrelipase 
DR API [INVESTIGATOR_220982] , in order 
to produce Creon using SPL API ( CREON -SPL).  This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical 
symptoms of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220983] ( CREON -SPL).
Information on CREON -ABT and CREON -SPLcan be found in Section 5.9.  Further information on 
pancrelipase DR currently marketed as Creon ®in the US can be found in the US Product Information 
(USPI).[ADDRESS_265270].
For further details, please see the current Creon Investigator's Brochure and the current product insert.5

interest (AESI) for this study and will be summarized separately .
4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Ph ase 4, prospective, single -arm, single -blinded study (subje ct will not be aware of the order in 
which study drug sare dispensed) .  Approximately [ADDRESS_265272] during Screening, are not 
eligible to rescreen. Subjects who f ail screening due to other reasons can be rescreened once.  In the 
event of rescreening, only prior disqualifying criterion/criteria will need to be repeated.
This study will consist of 4 periods as follows:
Screening Period :  Subjects have up to 14 days following the Screening Visit to confirm eligibility and 
enroll into the study at the Run -In Visit (RIV).  If all eligibility criteria can be verified during the Screening 
Visit, the RIV can occur on the same day as the Scree ning Visit, and the subject can be enrolled in the 
study and be dispensed Creon- ABT.If full eligibility cannot be confirmed at the Screening Visit, the 
subject will schedule the RIV on a separate date.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Run-in Period :
At the RIV, after eligibility is conf irmed, the subject will be dispensed blinded Creon 24,000 lipase units 
(LU) manufactured with Abbott API ( CREON -ABT) to be used for the duration of the Run -in Period (28 
days) at the same stable individual dose of Creon he/she was on before Screening.  Thi s assures that the 
Day 1 assessment reflects the symptoms on stable CREON -ABT use.
Treatment Period :  Subjects who complete the Run -in Period will be assessed for the continuation 
criteria at Day 1.  Only subjects who meet all continuation criteria will be dispensed additional study 
drug.  Blinded CREON -ABT study drug from the Run-In Period will be returned, and the subject will be 
dispensed blinded Creon 24,[ADDRESS_265273] API ( CREON -SPL) to use at the same stable 
individual dose per LUof Cre on he/she was on before Screening and during the Run-in Period.  This 
assures that the treatment assessments after Day [ADDRESS_265274].  Symptoms 
will be assessed at Day 1 and over both short -(Day 8) and long- term (Days 15, 29, and 85) .  Study 
procedures, including assessment of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220984] (AEs), will be conducted at each 
visit.
Post -Treatment Period :  Subjects who complete or prematurely discontinue the Treatment Period will 
be followed for [ADDRESS_265275]'s well- being.
The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1.  Further details regarding study procedures are located 
in the Operations Manual.
See Section 5.1for information regarding eligibility criteria.

STUDY M21 -432  |  Version 1.[ADDRESS_265276] ( patient reported outcome 
[PRO ]).  The 7-dayrecall period of the PEI-Q instrument assures that the measurement obtained at Day 
[ADDRESS_265277] of this assignment.
Additionally, a study with a simple design (e.g., utilizing telemedicine visits, avoiding confinement 
period, diet standardization or stool collection) was chosen to facilitate study execution during the 
current SARS -CoV-2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], in alignment with the study objective.  The number of in -person visits was 
minimized to essential visits where labs are collected, or study drug is dispensed/reconciled.  Most study 
visits will be conducted remotely via a telemedicine visit or a phone call.
Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  All 
pharmacodynamic and safety -related measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease 
activity in subjects with CF or CP.  All clinical and laboratory procedures in this st udy are standard and 
generally accepted.
The pharmacodynamic assessments will be conducted using an EPI -specific PRO measure –the PEI -Q.  
The PEI -Q is an [ADDRESS_265278] Population
Male and female subjects with EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220985].  Subjects who meet the continuation criteria at Day 1 will be allowed to 
initiate the Treatm ent Period of the study.  The instrument that will be used to assess EPI [CONTACT_23805] 
(PEI-Q) was developed in a population of CF and CP patients.  As subjects are required to be clinically 
controlled in their current PERT regimen, and subjects with a TSS ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_265279] is

to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be 
advised on th e continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with 
study drug early.
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the 
procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) should be completed as soon as 
possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_265302] dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment -emergent AEs/serious adverse 
events (SAEs) have been resolved.
5.[ADDRESS_265303] provided the sponsor (or an authorized 
representative) with all required study documents, including Independent ethics 
committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB) approval, and have signed a clinical study agreement.
Study drug capsules ( CREON -ABT orCREON -SPL) will be taken orally with each meal and snack (as per 
patient's usual practice) with enough fluids to swallow the capsules completely.  Capsu les must be 
swallowed whole (capsules must not be crushed, chewed, or opened).  Subjects will maintain 
throughout the study the same stable individual dose per LUof Creon they were on before initiating 
Screening.
If the Screening Visit and the RIV do not occur on the same day, subjects will continue their existing 
stable dose of commercial Creon until the RIV.
At the RIV, eligible subjects will be dispensed blinded Creon 24,000 LU manufactured with Abbott API 
(CREON -ABT) for the Run-in Period. At the RIV, and for the duration of the study, eligible subjects will 
stop using the commercial Creon 24,000 LU capsules they were taking before the RIV and begin taking 
the same corresponding number of capsules at meals and snacks ( maintain ing the same daily dosing as 
prescribed by [CONTACT_221003]), using the 24,[ADDRESS_265304] API ( CREON -SPL) for 
the Treatment Period at the same dose used during the Run -in Period.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The subjects wi ll be blinded to the type of study drug they will be receiving; therefore, site personnel 
MUST NOT inform the subject whether they are receiving CREON -ABT or CREON -SPLat each 
dispensation visit, in order to maintain the single -blind of the study.
If a sub ject forgets to take their study drug dose at their regularly scheduled dosing time, they should 
take the next dose at the next snack or meal. Information on the study drugs is provided in Table 1.  
[COMPANY_013] -provided study drug must not be substituted.  Direct -from -patient shippi[INVESTIGATOR_220992] 85/PD Visit is 
also described in the Operations Manual ( Appendix E).
The subject will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at 
the completion of the Run-in and Treatment Periods.  The study site personnel wil l document study drug 
usage .
Pancrelipase ( CREON -ABT or CREON -SPL) will be packaged in bottles with quantities sufficient to 
accommodate the study design. Each kit will be labeled per local requirements and this label must 
remain affixed to the kit.  Upon receipt, study drug should be stored as specified on the label and kept in 
a secure location.  Each kit will contain a unique kit number.  This kit number is assigned to a subject via 
interactive response technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the 
subject's corresponding study visit.  Site staff will complete all blank spaces on the label before 
dispensing to subjects.  Study drug will only be used for the conduct of this study.

The investigator or his/her representative will verify that the digital health tools (e.g., PRO devices) are 
received intact and in the correct amounts.  A proof of receipt or similar document will be kept in the 
site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, sites will maintain records of traceability, accountability, and return including but not limited 
to date received/dispensed/returned, subject number, and the identification of the person 
dispensing/returning the digital health tools.
5.10 Drug Assignment
This is a single -arm study, and all eligible subjects will receive both study drugs ( CREON -ABT during the 
Run-in Period; CREON -SPLduring the study Treatment Period).  However, to blind subjects to the 
sequence of study drugs, the IRT system will be used to allocate drug.
All subjects will be assigned a unique subject identification number by [CONTACT_110990].  For 
subjects who rescreen, the subject number assigned by [CONTACT_221004].
[COMPANY_013] personnel, the investigator, study site personnel, and anyone with access to the full protocol, 
will be unblinded to the sequence of study drug assignment. Only subjects will remain blinded to their 
treatments throughout the study.  To maintain the subject blind, the CREON -SPLand CREON -ABT
capsules provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The investigator, study site personnel 
must not inform the subject of the order they will receive the [ADDRESS_265305] experiences an AE.
5.11 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except whe n necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is i dentified, including those that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic), 
the investigator is responsible for notifying independent ethics committee (IEC)/independent review 
board (IRB), regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
5.12 Data Monitoring Committee
The external, independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will review unblinded safety data during

For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance who se color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device damage or not 
working properly, or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Eve nts and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the u se of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations "such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off- label us e, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AEor not. Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AEshould be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEsonly if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
The investigators wi ll monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an A E if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has

The following TEAEs compatible with clinical symptoms of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220993] s tudy:
Diarrhea 
Abdominal pain
Abdominal bloating
Flatulence
Steatorrhea
Patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of worsening EPI [INVESTIGATOR_220994].
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AEas mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The inve stigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternat ive causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship to Creon 
24,[ADDRESS_265308].
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship to Creon 
24,[ADDRESS_265309].

STUDY M21 -432  |  Version 1.[ADDRESS_265310] be 
discontinued (Section 5.7).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the 
pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_265311] of care.
For suspected COVID -19 infection, prompt and comprehensive evaluation should be performed to 
confirm COVID -19 infection or exclude other causes (e.g., influenza).  For negative COVID -19 results, the 
investigator should consider re -testing b ased on clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798] (exposures, clinical findings).
All cases of suspected or confirmed COVID -[ADDRESS_265312] be discussed with the Sponsor/Emergency 
Medical Contact [CONTACT_221005] -19 testing, alternative etiologies and/or study visit

7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on high level description of the 
statistical analyses.  Complete and specific d etails of the statistical analysis will be described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
The planned analyses will be conducted after all subjects have completed the study or prematurely 
discontinued from the study.
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all enrolled subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_265313] disposition and baseline characteristics.
A Per -Protocol (PP) Population includes all enrol led subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_265314], had Day 1 (baseline) PEI -Q scores collected, and had at least one post -baseline PEI -Q 
scores collected during the Treatment Period (Days 8, 15, 29, and 85).  The pharmacodynamic endpoint s 
will be analyzed in the PP Population.

STUDY M21 -432  |  Version 1.0 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The Safety Analysis Set for CREON -ABT (SAS -CREON -ABT) consists of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_265315](SAS -
CREON -SPL) co nsists of all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_265316] study drug.
7.3 Handling Potential Intercurrent Events for the Study Endpoints
The pharmacodynamic endpoints (TSS, ASDS and BMSS) will be analyzed based on the PP population 
and the following pot ential intercurrent events will be addressed:
Subjects who did not receive any dose of study drug CREON -SPLwill be excluded from the PP 
population.
Subjects who did not have baseline (Day 1) PEI -Q score data or did not have any post -baseline 
PEI-Q score d ata will be excluded from the PP population. 
Subjects who have missing PEI- Q data for the visit will be excluded from the analysis of that visit.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Pharmacodynamic Endpoints
Summary and Analysis of the Pharmacodynamic Endpoint s
Analyses of the pharmacodynamic endpoints will be conducted on the PP population.  Descriptive 
statistics (N, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, min imum , and max imum ) will be used to 
summarize the TSS as well as the symptom score for each domain of abdomi nal symptoms and bowel 
movement symptoms from PEI -Q.  The summaries will be provided for the Screening Visit, Baseline Visit 
(Day 1), each Post -Baseline Visit (Days 8, 15, 29, 85), and the change from baseline for each .  Two-sided 
95% confidence interval b ased on t -distribution will also be provided for the mean estimate of each 
score at each visit, and the mean change from baseline for each post -baseline visit.
7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Safety analyses will be provided based on safety analysis sets.  Number and proportion of subjects 
reporting a TEAE during the Run-in Period ( CREON -ABT) and Treatment Period ( CREON -SPL), will be 
summarized separately using SAS -CREON -ABT and SAS- CREON -SPL, respectively.  A TEAE compatible 
with the clinical symptoms of EPI (see Section 6.1) will be considered an AESI and will be summarized 
separately.  Details of the safety analyses wil l be pro vided in the SAP.
Adverse event will be coded using MedDRA . A -TEAE is defined as an AE with an onset date on or after 
the first dose of corresponding study drug and within [ADDRESS_265317] dose of study drug or 
initiation of the next study drug, whichever is earlier.  The number and percentage of subjects 
experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using MedDRA system organ class (SOC ) and preferred term (PT) , 
as well as by [CONTACT_221006].  Summaries 
(i.e., number and percentages) of TEAEs, SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AESIs will be 
provided.

STUDY M21 -432  |  Version 1.[ADDRESS_265318] opout rate of 20% after the RIV , the number of evaluable subjects will be around 24 for 
the analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints.
Based on Johnson CD, et al ,6the average TSS from PEI -Q was estimated to be 1.4 (SD = 0.7) for CP and CF 
subjects with EPI [CONTACT_23805].  Assuming the covariance between the TSS at baseline and post -baseline 
after switching to CREON -SPLto be 0.365, the SD for the change of the TSS between baseline and post -
baseline is estimated to be 0.5.  A sample size of 24 evaluable subjects will provide a precision of ± 0.2 in 
terms of half- length of the 95% confidence interval for the e stimate of change in TSS based on PEI -Q.
8ETHICS
8.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board 
(IEC/IRB)

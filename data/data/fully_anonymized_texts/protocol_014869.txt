It will be conducted in three surgical specialties (general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and obstetric/gynecological surgery) at 19 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563812]. At each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], these specialties will each be randomized to a control group or one of two nudge groups. Both types of email-based nudges are expected to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_563813]. Objectives: Primary Objective: Health Services Research  Secondary Objectives: Basic Science Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Share of discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_563814]: • Morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) prescribed at discharge • Days' supply of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27292] • Share of discharges where any opi[INVESTIGATOR_563815] • Share of patients on opi[INVESTIGATOR_563816] [ADDRESS_740813]-discharge • Number of 30-day all-cause emergency department visits • Number of 30-day all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] • Share of discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_563817] 1.1.1 Protocol #R01DA046226 12 October 2021

Postoperative Nudges to Reduce Opi[INVESTIGATOR_563810] 1.1.1 Protocol #R01DA046226 [ADDRESS_740815]-operative overprescribing puts both patients and communities at risk, increasing the patient’s likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_563820]8-14 or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced ventilatory impairmenINT1 and adding to the reservoir of unused opi[INVESTIGATOR_563821].11, 15  The discrepancy between clinicians’ awareness of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_563822]—over half of opi[INVESTIGATOR_563823]7—suggests that prescribing practices are not based on purely rational decisions. Indeed, behavioral research has shown that judgment and decision making of both laypeople and experts in a variety of disciplines falls short of rational standards in systematic and predictable ways.16-19 Even well-informed clinicians make cognitive errors when estimating the benefits and harms of treatment, and these errors are especially likely where there is uncertainty about risks and benefits (as with opi[INVESTIGATOR_563824]).[ADDRESS_740816] successfully leveraged behavioral insights to design “choice architecture” that “nudges” individuals to make better decisions without infringing on their freedom of choice.21, [ADDRESS_740817] to conform with their peers’ behavior.24, 25 Abundant research has found that people (including clinicians) are strongly motivated to adhere to prevailing social norms,24, 25 and that nudges based on describing social norms can be used to influence prescribing decisions.26   Another type of behavioral nudge relies on motivation to follow injunctive norms—to do what is considered the “right thing to do”. For example, clinicians may be motivated to follow best practice guidelines published by a well-respected organization. Previous studies suggest that such guidelines are in reality often ignored and thus ineffective in changing behavior,27, 28 but there is insufficient evidence to determine whether they are more or less effective than nudges that describe peer behavior.  Both of these types of nudges—nudges based on descriptive norms and nudges based on injunctive norms—have been applied to the issue of excessive post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414].29-[ADDRESS_740818] bundled and tested different interventions together (e.g., grand rounds presentations or

Accordingly, the evidence base for the effectiveness of behavioral nudges in influencing post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_563825].  2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    2.3.[ADDRESS_740819] patient satisfaction39, 40, pain scores39-41, or refill rates42-44.  2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  By [CONTACT_563901][INVESTIGATOR_563826], we both improve health and advance science. From a public health perspective, overprescribing is the major upstream driver of increases in chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_563827] (including the transition to heroin), and studies similar to ours have been successful in curbing this overprescribing.29-[ADDRESS_740820].  2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  We believe that our study’s significant potential benefits, especially in the current context of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817], far outweigh the minor and unlikely risks it may present to patients.

One nudge will provide feedback on the surgeon’s prescribing behavior relative to institutional prescribing guidelines (an injunctive norm); the other will provide feedback on their prescribing behavior relative to their peers (a descriptive norm).

From this we determined that delivering the nudges monthly achieved a balance between exposing them to the intervention and burdening them with emails. We chose to deliver the nudges by [CONTACT_563902] a low burden to surgeons, has been successful in a similar study conducted at Sutter Health,45 and would be easily scalable beyond Sutter Health if our nudges prove effective.

  6 4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION The study is considered to be completed once data has been collected for one year after the date on which the final nudges were delivered.    5 STUDY POPULATION  5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA Eligible discharge prescriptions meet all of the following criteria: • the patient is at least 18 years old at the date of surgery • the patient is discharged to their home • the surgical procedure has an applicable post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_563832] • the surgical procedure is the only surgical procedure performed during the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] • the prescription is for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_563833] (tablets, capsules, or liquid solution)  5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA To avoid contamination between the intervention arms, surgeons who operate across multiple surgical specialties (defined as surgeons who performed less than 90% of their total procedures in one specialty between 1 June 2020 and 31 May 2021) will not be eligible. 5.[ADDRESS_740824] been recruited and will be retained through communication with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]- and system-level administrators.   6 STUDY INTERVENTION  6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) ADMINISTRATION  6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION Surgeons randomized to our study intervention will receive one of two types of behavioral nudges delivered as monthly emails. The two nudges will be active for twelve months (October 2021–October 2022).  
Postoperative Nudges to Reduce Opi[INVESTIGATOR_563810] 1.1.1 Protocol #R01DA046226 [ADDRESS_740825]-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_563834].32, 46, 47(and personal communication with [CONTACT_563924], Ph.D., MPH, on opi[INVESTIGATOR_563835], March 12, 2021; unreferenced) These guidelines recommend ranges of 5mg oxycodone tablet quantities specific to the procedure performed and are partly based on patient surveys of actual post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].   In both nudge conditions, eligibility for receiving a monthly nudge is contingent upon at least two of the surgeon’s patients being discharged with a post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_563836]. Though it may seem counterintuitive for the descriptive norm nudge to be based implicitly on prescribing guidelines, this choice ensures patient safety and avoids confounding the content of the nudge with the threshold for receiving a nudge.  Intervention arm 1: nudge based on descriptive norms Surgeons randomized to this condition will receive an email with the following content at the end of each month in which at least two of their patients are discharged with a post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_563837].   [Subject line: Your peers vs. your opi[INVESTIGATOR_563838]]  Dear Dr. [Name],  In an effort to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_563839], Sutter Health is reviewing opi[INVESTIGATOR_563840].   In [month], at least XX of your patients were discharged with opi[INVESTIGATOR_563841]% of your peers for these procedures.   YY% of [specialty] surgeons at Sutter Health prescribe within the ranges below.   We will continue to send you opi[INVESTIGATOR_563842].   Sincerely, [Signature(s) of chief medical executive, chief of staff, and/or surgical department chair at the surgeon’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]]  [Table including each procedure type performed by [CONTACT_563903] “Amount prescribed by [CONTACT_563904] (5mg oxycodone tablets)”, with a footnote stating the conversion factors for hydrocodone and tramadol]    The ranges of 5mg oxycodone tablets displayed in the email will be the same as the ranges stipulated by [CONTACT_563905], but this nudge will not include any language about guidelines.  Intervention arm 2: nudge based on injunctive norms This condition will be identical to the first condition, except the content of the monthly emails will refer to safety guidelines rather than the surgeon’s peers.

In [month], at least XX of your patients were discharged with opi[INVESTIGATOR_563843].   For patient safety, Sutter Health recommends prescribing within the ranges below for these procedures. Doing so will also meet best practice safety guidelines for post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414].    We will continue to send you opi[INVESTIGATOR_563842].   Sincerely, [Signature(s) of chief medical executive, chief of staff, and/or surgical department chair at the surgeon’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]]  [Table including each procedure type performed by [CONTACT_563903] “Amount recommended by [CONTACT_563906] (5mg oxycodone tablets)”, with a footnote stating the conversion factors for hydrocodone and tramadol]    Control arm Surgeons randomized to the control arm will not receive any nudges and will not be informed of the study. By [CONTACT_563907], we will prevent a Hawthorne effect and obtain an accurate representation of status quo prescribing behavior against which to test the effects of the nudges. 6.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION Nudges will be delivered monthly through the email software MyEmma.  6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY  6.2.[ADDRESS_740826] coordinator at Sutter Health using data extracted from Sutter Health’s electronic health record by a data analyst at Sutter Health. They will be prepared by

The email software MyEmma will be used to prepare and send the nudges.  6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING The study design has four levels: patients, surgeons, surgical specialties, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Randomization will take place at the level of the surgical specialty, using a blocked scheme to ensure that each arm has a balance of large and small hospi[INVESTIGATOR_161501] a sample size of surgeons similar to the other two arms.  All investigators except the Sutter Health data analyst extracting the electronic health record data and the Sutter Health project coordinator preparing the nudges will be blinded to intervention assignment.  6.[ADDRESS_740828] coordinator at Sutter Health will prepare and send the monthly nudges according to the predetermined schedule (sent on the third Tuesday each month from October 2021 through September 2022). This study team member will report to the site principal investigator, Xiaowei Sherry Yan, and the study principal investigator, Katherine Watkins, after each nudge is sent.  6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY Not applicable.   7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION The study’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may make a recommendation to discontinue the study intervention at any time based on an assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of study participation. If the study intervention is discontinued, data will continue to be collected for another 12 months from the date of discontinuation.  7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY Participants may discontinue the study intervention at any time by [CONTACT_563909] (an email address will be provided in each nudge) or by [CONTACT_17325] “Unsubscribe” button at the bottom of any nudge email. Their discontinuation and any reasons given will be recorded by [CONTACT_473]. Data on their prescribing behavior will still be passively collected through the electronic health record until the study’s data collection period ends.  7.[ADDRESS_740829] TO FOLLOW-UP Not applicable.

  12 8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_563910]. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS  The medical professionals on the study team will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention. 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during the preparation of monthly adverse event reports or half-yearly presentations to the DSMB.  All AEs will be recorded. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, and relationship to study. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  8.3.[ADDRESS_740832] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event.

The alternative hypotheses are that (1) 𝛽!≠0, (2) 𝛽"≠0, and (3) 𝛽!≠𝛽".  9.[ADDRESS_740834] data from the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. We estimated design parameters required by [CONTACT_563911] R software,48 which provides the capability to estimate statistical power for randomized block clustered designs. Examining medication dose, input parameters for the calculation included unconditional intracluster correlations (ICC) for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ICC=0.005), service line (ICC=0.039), and provider (ICC=0.337) levels; the number of service line groups (up to three per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]); the number of providers by [CONTACT_563912]; and number of patients per service line. The ICCs were empi[INVESTIGATOR_563858]. We assumed that covariates informative of the dosage would explain between 25 percent and 50 percent of the dosage variation at each of the patient, provider, and service line levels (i.e., R2 between 0.25 and 0.50). We derived statistical power, assuming one third of the service line groups within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563859] (two treatment and one control). We computed power for pairwise comparison of each of the two nudge arms versus the no nudge arm and adjusted our alpha level to account for multiple comparisons (alpha=0.05/2). We will have 80% power to detect significant differences between the intervention conditions of at least a minimum detectable effect size (MDES) = 0.[ADDRESS_740835] deviations (SDs) when R2=0.25, while R2=0.5 would yield a MDES of 0.305.  9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES Our main analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat dataset including all randomized surgeons. Sensitivity analyses may be conducted on a dataset excluding surgeons who received no nudges.  9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH The effects of each nudge intervention relative to the control group and to each other will be tested using a four-level hierarchical model adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.  
Postoperative Nudges to Reduce Opi[INVESTIGATOR_563810] 1.1.1 Protocol #R01DA046226 12 October 2021 
  15 9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS Our primary outcome is the share of discharge prescriptions that were above the guideline for the respective procedure (see above for how guidelines were identified). Prescribing above guidelines is the outcome to which both nudges are linked (even though the descriptive norm nudge does not explicitly refer to guidelines) and thus a key measure of whether clinician behavior responds to the nudges. We define a prescription as being above guidelines if the morphine milligram equivalent (MME) quantity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_563860]-specific guideline (guidelines range from zero to a ceiling). If no opi[INVESTIGATOR_563861], we will code this as within guideline.   We will also analyze the following secondary outcomes to further understand the effects of the intervention.  • MMEs prescribed at discharge  • Days’ supply of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27292]  • Share of discharges where any opi[INVESTIGATOR_563815]  • Share of patients on opi[INVESTIGATOR_563862]-discharge  • Number of 30-day all-cause emergency department visits  • Number of 30-day all-cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]  • Share of discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_563863] 12 months after the nudges end   Primary analysis We will analyze outcomes at the level of the discharge using a four-level hierarchical linear model (HLM),[42] thus capturing the clustering inherent in the study design and data generating process. We will analyze outcomes at the patient level, and patients are nested within surgeons, who are nested within specialties, which are nested within hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Both primary and secondary outcomes will follow this modeling structure. To improve the precision of our estimates, we will also include a set of observable patient covariates (X), surgeon covariates (Z), specialty covariates (U), and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563857] (W). For patient 𝑖, treated by [CONTACT_7995] 𝑝, in specialty 𝑠, at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ℎ, we consider the following HLM formulation for continuous outcomes 𝑌#$%&:  𝑌#$%&=𝛽'+𝛽!𝐴𝑅𝑀1%&+𝛽"𝐴𝑅𝑀2%&+𝛾!&𝐴𝑅𝑀1%&+𝛾"&𝐴𝑅𝑀2%&+		 𝜔!𝑋#$%&+𝜔"𝑍$%&+𝜔(𝑈%&+𝜔)𝑊&+𝛾&+𝜂%&+𝜑$%&+𝜀#$%&(1)  𝐴𝑅𝑀1%& and 𝐴𝑅𝑀2%& are indicator variables for whether specialty 𝑠, at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ℎ were assigned to intervention arm one or two respectively.   The key terms in the equation are	𝛽!and 𝛽", the covariate-adjusted treatment effects of arms 1 and 2 relative to the control arm; 𝛽! answers research question 1 and 𝛽" answers research question 2. We will use an F-test to compare coefficients 𝛽!	and 𝛽" to answer research question 3. Thus, the effect of each nudge is estimated relative to receiving no nudges and to the other nudge.  The model allows for the possibility that the treatment effect varies across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], as captured by [CONTACT_563913] (𝛾!&,𝛾"&). Unexplained variation in each of the levels is captured by [CONTACT_563913] 𝜀#$%&, 𝜑$%&, 𝜂%&, and 𝛾&. We will initially model these six random effects as independent but will also investigate whether including a covariance structure across these components is appropriate. The coefficients 𝜔!, 𝜔", and 𝜔(, capture the influence of the covariates at the patient, surgeon, and specialty respectively, and covariates will be mean centered as appropriate to aid in model

  16 interpretation. Covariates may include but are not limited to the following: Level 1: patient age, patient sex, patient comorbidities, procedure type, length of operating time; Level 2: surgeon sex, year of surgeon’s medical degree; Level 3: total volume of procedures within the specialty: Level 4: number of beds, urbanicity, proportion of patients on Medicaid. Given that the covariates will not change the estimate of the treatment effect (in expectation), only reduce unexplained variance, we will choose a final pool of covariates that we find to be predictive the primary outcome. Model estimates of the treatment effects will adjust standard errors for clustering due to the due to clustered assignment of the interventions.  For binary outcomes, we implement a hierarchical generalized linear model by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a logit link for Equation (1). Note that the Level 1 error term 𝜀#$%& is also eliminated. The concatenated model for all four levels with a binary outcome then reduces to:  	𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑌#$%&)=𝛽'+𝛽!𝐴𝑅𝑀1%&+𝛽"𝐴𝑅𝑀2%&+𝛾!&𝐴𝑅𝑀1%&+𝛾"&𝐴𝑅𝑀2%&+		 𝜔!𝑋#$%&+𝜔"𝑍$%&+𝜔(𝑈%&+𝜔)𝑊&+𝛾&+𝜂%&+𝜑$%&(2)  In the binary outcome version, the parameters 𝛽!and 𝛽" again identify the treatment effects of arms [ADDRESS_740836]-intervention (the “persistence period”). The analysis model above will be modified by [CONTACT_563914]. The statistical significance of these interaction terms will be used to assess whether the treatment effect significantly differs post-RCT.   9.4.3 SAFETY ANALYSES Safety endpoints include: • Dates and associated diagnoses of emergency department visits within 30 days of discharge • Discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_563864] 8.2.  9.4.4 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS Intervention groups will be compared on the proportion of discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_563865], proportion of discharges with any opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447], and average discharge opi[INVESTIGATOR_563866] (1 June 2020 through 18 October 2021).  9.4.5 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES

Our rationale was as follows: • The research involves no more than minimal risk to participants.  • The waiver would not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants, as the planned interventions are "nudges" and providers will be free to prescribe what they deem appropriate. • The research could not practicably be done without a waiver of consent. We expect that allowing providers the opportunity to opt out of this trial would compromise the results of this trial by [CONTACT_563917]. 10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.   Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants

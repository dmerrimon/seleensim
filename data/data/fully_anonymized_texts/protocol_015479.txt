CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     5  2. Synopsis Sickle cell disease (SCD) causes progressive cardiopulmonary morbidity, beginning in childhood, which can ultimately be fatal. As a group, cardiopulmonary complications, such as acute chest syndrome and sudden death, are now the most common causes of death in SCD, especially in adolescents and adults. Patients with SCD have features of both an anemia-related, high cardiac output state and a restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). We propose that this unique RCM is an overlooked and understudied complication of SCD. RCM could explain the modest increases in pulmonary artery pressure in patients with SCD, as measured by [CONTACT_749059] (TRJV), which has often been attributed to a primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). RCM could also be the cause of unexplained sudden cardiac death in SCD, which is a feature of other forms of RCM. Our overarching hypothesis is that increased ROS-mediated AT1R-TGFβ1 signaling is pro-fibrotic and, in combination with vaso-occlusive ischemia-reperfusion injury, results in an age-dependent, progressive RCM that can be detected by [CONTACT_105]-invasive cardiac imaging. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], longitudinal, observational study uses a novel, comprehensive, multimodal cardiac imaging strategy, combining cutting-edge cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and echocardiographic tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), to demonstrate the unique RCM of SCD, characterizing its frequency and the temporal evolution over a 2-year period. We will also correlate the RCM phenotype with biomarkers of ROS and RAS-TGFβ1 signaling. This research could change our understanding of how SCD affects the heart and lungs. We propose studies that will change the current concept of primary pulmonary vasculopathy to a cardiomyopathy-centered model with secondary pulmonary vascular changes leading to sudden death. This translational pi[INVESTIGATOR_749034] a novel, clear, quantifiable CMR phenotype with established diagnostic performance that will be used in phase II/III clinical trials to test anti-fibrotic therapy to prevent or reverse SCD-related RCM. 3. Background and Rationale SCD is the name [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a group of recessive genetic disorders caused by [CONTACT_749060] (HbS). The most common and severe form of SCD is sickle cell anemia (HbSS), the homozygous state for the HbS mutation (b6 gluèval). Other forms of SCD result from compound heterozygous states with HbS and other b-hemoglobinopathies, such as b0-thalassemia (sickle-b0-thalassemia). HbS is insoluble in the deoxygenated state. So, as HbS-containing red blood cells traverse the circulation undergoing cycles of oxygenation and deoxygenation, HbS repeatedly forms rigid polymers that damage the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and drastically shorten RBC lifespan. These HbS-containing RBCs can also obstruct the microcirculation before their premature demise. Consequently, individuals with SCD have chronic hemolytic anemia and epi[INVESTIGATOR_749035]-occlusive crises. Approximately 1 in 700 African-Americans has SCD at birth, and as many as 100,000 individuals are affected in the [LOCATION_002]. [1,2]. Elevated Pulmonary Artery Pressure in SCD Sickle cell disease (SCD) causes progressive cardiopulmonary morbidity, beginning in childhood, which can ultimately be fatal. [3] As a group, cardiopulmonary complications, such as acute chest syndrome and sudden death, are now the most common causes of death in SCD, especially in young adults. [4,5] Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) has been the focus of much recent research and debate. [6,7] Echocardiographic measurements of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) are commonly used to estimate the prevalence of PAH (TRJV > 2.5 m/s), which has consistently been approximately 30% in both children and adults. Indeed, an elevated TRJV is associated with early mortality in adults, [8] although not children. [9] Multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_749036] (RV) pressures with adverse events in patients with SCD. [8,10,11] These data have been interpreted to support the idea that hemolysis-related endothelial dysfunction causes PAH, which is responsible for the observed increase in RV pressure.  
CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     6  However, in a series of recent studies, patients were selected to undergo right heart catheterization based on echocardiographic screening. [12-14] These studies showed the prevalence of PAH (defined simply as mPAP ≥ 25 mmHg) is low, ranging from 6-10%, and that the prevalence of moderate to severe PAH is significantly less. The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of these patients is markedly lower than that reported in other pulmonary hypertension populations. [12] In one study, the PVR in all the patients with SCD was within the normal range. [15] Consequently, the number of adverse events in these patients with very mild elevation in pulmonary pressures exceeds that expected in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. [16] These observations have led us to propose that the primary mechanism for cardiac morbidity and mortality including sudden death is not primary PAH, but rather a unique restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Restrictive Cardiomyopathy Several lines of data suggest that increased right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure in SCD is secondary to the restrictive left ventricular (LV) physiology found in restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and not a primary form of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). These lines of evidence include: (1) It is well known that impaired diastolic filling is common in all SCD patients, including young patients, before they develop increased RV pressures.[17] In a study by [CONTACT_749061]., all children between the ages of 6-18y had an abnormal E/e’ ratio on echocardiography, a marker of increased left atrial (LA) pressure.[18] This finding was also seen in a group SCD patients undergoing sleep studies.[19] Although it has been postulated that impaired relaxation and restrictive filling is secondary to iron deposition, Hankins et al. showed no significant iron deposition by [CONTACT_9268] T2* measurements. It has also been postulated that the diastolic dysfunction seen in these patients is secondary to hypertrophy; however, Hankins et al. also showed that no patients had abnormal age-corrected indexed LV mass. (2) The diastolic dysfunction seen in SCD appears to precede the PA pressure elevation. A study by [CONTACT_749062]. showed abnormalities in nearly all diastolic filling parameters in a group of 54 children with SCD, but none had significant elevations of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV).[20] Dham et al. reported a group of SCD children with minimal TRJV increase but with a high prevalence diastolic dysfunction.[21] (3) There is a high rate of sudden death, in excess of what is seen in the idiopathic PAH population, in the SCD population, with relatively low PA pressures. While not consistent with what is seen in the pediatric and adult PAH population, this high rate of sudden death is consistent with that  seen in RCM, in which there is an excessive rate of sudden death (28% in a pediatric cohort; 2-year survival 50% and 5-year survival 25% in some series).[22,23] As in SCD, the risk of sudden death is particularly high in young patients with idiopathic RCM associated with PAH.  The standard definition of RCM includes (1) dilated atria, (2) normal or nearly normal left ventricular systolic function without significant ventricular dilatation; (3) no echocardiographic evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; and (4) no evidence of constrictive pericarditis. Supportive evidence for RCM includes a restrictive mitral inflow pattern by [CONTACT_472412]-wave Doppler. The cardiomyopathy in sickle cell disease is characterized by [CONTACT_749063], normal or supra-normal systolic function, impaired relaxation, and restrictive filling patterns. However, the ventricles are typi[INVESTIGATOR_749037], likely due to the anemia-related high output state. We propose that the cardiomyopathy of SCD is a unique RCM phenotype with normal to mildly dilated left ventricle with abnormal diastolic relaxation, increasingly elevated left atrial pressures, and normal systolic function as a result of myocardial fibrosis (Figure 1). It is this cardiomyopathy that results in elevated post-capi[INVESTIGATOR_749038], secondary PAH, and elevated TRJV.

CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     7  Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) CMR will be used to characterize cardiac structure and function in this study of children and adults with SCD. CMR provides functional data (systolic and diastolic) and myocardial tissue characterization. CMR is ideal for measuring ventricular volumes and masses, because it is not restricted by [CONTACT_749064], provides high contrast images, and is inherently three-dimensional (3-d). CMR has been validated against ex vivo samples for measurements in adult and pediatric ventricles. [24-27] The intra- and inter-observer variability for standard cardiac MRI measures is 3-8%. [28,29] Compared to echocardiography, CMR is also less variable and more reproducible, allowing smaller sample sizes for clinical studies (Figure 2).  Diastolic assessment with CMR is validated for assessment of myocardial relaxation and filling dynamics. [30,31] Using velocity sensitive phase contrast imaging of the mitral valve inflow and the left ventricular myocardium, diastolic parameters including isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), early to late inflow ratio (E/A ratio), deceleration time (DT), and mitral valve inflow to septal velocity ratio (E/e’) are measured with both accuracy and precision compared with echocardiography (Figure 3). [32,33] Using standard planimetry, the left atrial volume provides an indirect measure of the filling pressure. There are also novel deformational diastolic parameters that can be measured including diastolic strain rate, untwisting, and torsion (Figures 4, 5). [34]  
Figure 3. Restrictive LV filling in SCD. Myocardial velocity (green) and mitral valve (red) inflow phase contrast curves from a SCD patient at CCHMC. The mitral valve inflow shows a markedly increased E/A ratio and the E/e’ is elevated consistent with restrictive filling. 
Figure 2. CMR is less variable and more reproducible than echocardiography in patients undergoing repeated LV measurements using both modalities. Standard deviations of CMR measurements are significantly lower than echocardiography. Decreased variability and greater reproducibility affords 80-90% smaller sample sizes to detect differences in cardiac structure and function.

CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.[ADDRESS_1024415] and comparing quantitative parameters with data from normal myocardium. [35] Myocardium can be differentiated from fat, fluid, inflammation, and fibrosis. [36] Regions of myocardial inflammation can be identified using T2-weighted imaging, secondary to higher fluid content in these areas of myocardial tissue. Similarly, regions of edema can be seen in active myocarditis and infiltrative cardiomyopathies. Gadolinium–diethylene-triamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) is a partially extracted extracellular contrast agent that resides in the interstitial space of territories that receive myocardial blood flow. Territories with scar have replacement fibrosis, more interstitial space, and as a result, they retain gadolinium. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) is the most widely used and investigated CMR technique for myocardial characterization (Figure 6). [37,38] LGE sequences obtained approximately [ADDRESS_1024416]. Gadolinium is paramagnetic resulting in significant signal differentiation. In T1-weighted pulse sequences normal myocardium is set to appear black with regions of gadolinium accumulation appearing bright. Enhanced (white) regions indicate areas of gadolinium accumulation and suggest the presence of inflammation, fibrosis, or scar.  The specific pattern of tissue characteristics can identify a given cardiomyopathy. For example, cardiac amyloidosis frequently demonstrates diffuse global subendocardial LGE. In contrast, cardiac sarcoidosis demonstrates patchy myocardial LGE of either the LV or right ventricle. Unlike other common non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is known to have a unique structural phenotype that classically involves asymmetric LV wall thickening of the basal interventricular septum. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, LGE is often present in a patchy midwall distribution, particularly at the insertion point of the left and right ventricles and regions of greatest hypertrophy. Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathies are generally recognized to have a typi[INVESTIGATOR_749040]. In contrast to chronic cardiomyopathies, active myocarditis typi[INVESTIGATOR_749041] T2-weighted images, signaling the presence of edema in these areas. Farther out from the initial onset of myocarditis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_749042]. Using these tissue characteristics, the etiology of cardiomyopathy can be derived in many cases and may obviate invasive myocardial biopsy.

CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     9  The majority of studies of SCD patients showed no significant areas of LGE. However, pathology (autopsy) data show significant areas of fibrosis. Small microscopic areas of fibrosis are not detected using standard post-Gd LGE techniques. Consequently, new CMR techniques have recently been developed to quantify the extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis present at a given time point.  Microscopic fibrosis has been shown to be quantified by [CONTACT_749065], which can be measured with T1 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. With this technique, decreases in the T1 time of the myocardium reflect increased interstitial space (microfibrosis) and increased gadolinium concentration throughout the myocardium. Thus, the relative distribution of gadolinium between the blood pool and myocardium can be used to estimate the amount of fibrosis within the myocardium. When quantified as the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) metric (Figure 7), [39] this relative distribution of gadolinium in the myocardium has been shown to correlate with the presence of fibrosis on surgical biopsies in patients with HCM. [40]  Preliminary Data In our preliminary study of 7 SCD patients (Table 1), all 7 had dilated atria and LVs, 6/7 had abnormal relaxation, and 5/7 had restrictive filling patterns with evidence of increased filling pressures. Consequently, 5/[ADDRESS_1024417] techniques. However, upon implementing the fibrosis imaging scheme using ECV parametric maps (Figure 7), our data show similar findings to those from SCD mice, where relaxation is impaired and ECV is increased. The image data were confirmed by [CONTACT_749066]. Overview of Research Plan and Deliverables We will now apply this novel and comprehensive imaging strategy, CMR with LGE and quantification of the extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis using the ECV metric (with supplementation by [CONTACT_749067]), for the first time to a representative group of children and adults with SCD to demonstrate the unique RCM of SCD. This research could change our understanding of how SCD affects the heart and lungs. We propose studies that will change the current concept of primary pulmonary vasculopathy to a cardiomyopathy-centered model with secondary pulmonary vascular changes leading to sudden death. This translational pi[INVESTIGATOR_749044]/III clinical trials to test anti-fibrotic therapy to prevent SCD-related RCM; specifically, this study will provide a novel, clear, quantifiable CMR phenotype with established diagnostic performance characteristics.

CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     10  4. Specific Aims This pi[INVESTIGATOR_749045]/III clinical trials to test anti-fibrotic therapy, such as losartan, as a means to prevent or reverse SCD-related RCM. 4.1. Aim 1: Frequency of RCM phenotype Estimate the proportion of the RCM phenotype in SCD in a representative sample of children and adults with SCD and how the proportion varies by [CONTACT_749068] a cross-sectional sample. We will also quantify the extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis using the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) metric. Hypothesis: The proportion of the RCM phenotype will be 30% in the overall study population, and the proportion increases in older age strata. 4.2. Aim 2: Stability of RCM phenotype Estimate the stability (resolution, non-progression, or progression) of the RCM phenotype over a 2-year period to determine its suitability as an outcome measure for a future clinical trial in children and adults with SCD who are imaged yearly. Hypothesis: The RCM phenotype, once detected by [CONTACT_9661], will not spontaneously resolve. 4.3. Aim 3: Association of RCM with TRJV Explore the association between tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) and RCM phenotype. Hypothesis: Individuals with a high TRJV (>2.5 m/s) will be more likely to have RCM features and more extensive fibrosis than those with a normal TRJV (≤2.5 m/s). 4.4. Aim 4: Biomarkers Estimate the within-patient and between-patient variability of a comprehensive panel of biomarkers for heart failure, ROS production, and RAS-TGFb1 signaling, as well as a panel of clinical laboratory tests. Explore the correlations between the RCM phenotype and the panel of biomarkers. Hypothesis: These biomarkers will have performance characteristics to serve as discriminative surrogate markers in future clinical trials. 5. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the RCM phenotype, which is defined for this study as the following: • Normal LV ejection fraction (%); • Impaired diastolic relaxation:  (dεcc/dt) 2 z-scores below normal; • Restrictive left ventricular filling:  deceleration time 2 z-scores below normal for age; • LA indexed volume 2 z-scores above normal; and • No evidence of infiltrative disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or constrictive pericarditis. All normal values will be age-appropriate when available. 6. Study Population 6.1.

Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. Study personnel may withdraw participants who are deemed to be non-compliant with study procedures. Another eligible participant may replace the withdrawn participant. The study data of such withdrawn participants will not be discarded and may be analyzed in post hoc analyses.  Although chronic transfusion therapy is an exclusion criterion, it is not a reason for withdrawal of subjects if begun after enrollment. 7. Study Design and Monitoring 7.1. Study Procedures Participants will have minimum of 4 study visits. Participants will undergo CMR and echocardiography at study entry (visit 1) and then yearly for two years (visits 2 and 3). Study procedures are detailed in Table 2.  Visit windows for each of the 4 visits will be ± 3 days.

CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     13  7.2. Laboratory Studies and Biomarkers 1. Clinical laboratories: Complete blood count, reticulocyte count, HbF quantitation, LDH, AST, bilirubin fractions, plasma free Hb, serum creatinine, ektacytometry, cystatin-C, urinalysis, and first-morning and 24-hour urine collection for protein, creatinine, microalbumin, and osmolality. Rationale: these tests are markers of SCD-related severity, renal function and/or indirect markers of hemolysis that will be correlated with clinical and imaging outcomes. In addition, a pregnancy test will determine if females of childbearing potential may proceed with the study. 2. Cardiac biomarkers: Plasma concentrations of the natriuretic peptides, NT-pro-BNP and MR-pro-ANP, and cardiac troponins. Rationale: these tests are markers of heart failure (including RCM) that will be correlated with clinical and imaging outcomes. 3. Biomarkers of ROS: RBC ROS measured by [CONTACT_4133]; plasma MDA by [CONTACT_5004]; RBC glutathione level; relative NOX1, NOX2, NOX4 and NOX5 expression in RBCs (WB); activity of Rac GTPases by [CONTACT_749073]-down. Rationale: these tests are indicators of oxidative stress that we hypothesize lead to the RCM phenotype that will be correlated with clinical and imaging outcomes. 4. Biomarkers of RAS-TGFb1: Plasma for renin activity, aldosterone level, active TGFb1, and PAI-1 activity; urine and serum for angiotensin-II and serum forangiotensinogen (oxidized and reduced forms for both); and AT1R expression on platelets and RBCs. Rationale: these assays are for markers of signaling through the RAS-TGFb1 pathways, that we hypothesize lead to the RCM phenotype that will be correlated with clinical and imaging outcomes. 5. Genetic testing: Screen for single nucleotide polymorphisms in ~100 genes that encode components of the RAS-TGFb1 pathways. Rationale: these are polymorphisms of components in the RAS-TGFb1 pathways that could modulate the development of the RCM phenotype that we hypothesize results from excessive TGFb1 signaling. 7.3. MRI Protocol CMR will be performed on a Philips Achieva 1.5T 70 cm bore scanner with a 32 channel dedicated cardiac coil. Parallel imaging with SENSE reconstruction (SENSE factor=2) will be used for acceleration. Acquisitions will be gated using a standard vectorcardiographic algorithm (VCG).  Subjects will be asked to breath hold as tolerated for the scanning sequences; subjects unable to breath hold will be scanned using “breathe-through” techniques that have become standard at most pediatric CMR centers, and has been shown to be accurate. Standard sequences will be performed including localizers and steady-state free precession cine CMR in the ventricular long and short axis planes for chamber sizes, EF, and ventricular mass. Once “standard” imaging is completed, cine myocardial tag imaging will be performed in short axis and 2 long axis planes of the mid-papi[INVESTIGATOR_749046] (spatial modulation of magnetization) technique.  Certified CMR technologists will perform all cardiac CMR scans with continuous guidance from pediatric CMR physicians.  The following sequences and procedures will be performed on all subjects: 1. Three plane SSFP localizer. 2. Axial Black Blood stack using a single shot technique 3. 2 Chamber, 4 Chamber, 3 chamber, and short axis cine SSFP  4. Single short axis T2* image

Endocardial and epi[INVESTIGATOR_749047] (MEDIS, Leiden, The Netherlands). The location of the atrioventricular valve planes will be confirmed by [CONTACT_749074] 2- and 4-chamber images.  An experienced analyst and CMR physician will draw all contours. The ventricular mass will be calculated as the difference between the ventricular epi[INVESTIGATOR_749048] (1.06 g/ml). The volume and mass will be indexed to the body surface area (BSA), calculated by [CONTACT_749075].  As an internal data verification, the ventricular stroke volume (RVEDV – RVESV) will be compared with the phase contrast derived cardiac output after excluding shunting. The left ventricular mid-ventricular systolic circumferential, longitudinal, and radial strains and the diastolic relaxation slope will be calculated using HARP algorithm with the 4 chamber and short axis CSPAMM images.  (HARP/SENC, Diagnasoft, Cary, NC).  A dedicated research expert will perform all strain analyses.  The ECV will be measured using a combination of MRmap 1.3 (Danial Messroghli, Berlin) and MATLAB.  MRmap allows creation of the T1 maps from MOLLI image sets.  Using Matlab (Mathworks, Natck, MA), a parametric image is created according to the following equations where R is the relaxation rate.  ECV and HCT are expressed as percentages.  7.4. Echocardiography (TDI) Protocol All patients will undergo a limited echocardiogram just prior to the MRI.  The echocardiogram will be focused to look at the Doppler tissue velocities of the myocardium, the atrioventricular inflows, and the TRJV.  All echocardiograms will be performed and all measurements will be made centrally in the core echocardiography laboratory at CCHMC.  As noted in our previous losartan in SCD grant, agitated saline will be used to increase the contrast of the TRJV.   Pre-procedure: • Assess for contraindications to agitated saline: pregnancy and known VSD ΔR1myo=1/T1myo−postGd−1/T1myo−preGdΔR1blood=1/T1blood−postGd−1/T1blood−preGdECV=ΔR1myo/ΔR1blood∗(100−HCT)

Sample Size and Analysis Plan This pi[INVESTIGATOR_749045]/III clinical trials to test anti-fibrotic therapy, such as losartan, as a means to prevent or reverse SCD-related RCM. Total sample size is based upon the degree of precision of the estimate of the true proportion of the RCM phenotype (see Aim 1) in combination with pragmatic issues. 8.1. Aim 1: Frequency of RCM phenotype The primary endpoint of this aim is diagnosis of RCM as defined by [CONTACT_85389]. Sample proportion and confidence interval will be used to make inference on the true proportion of the RCM phenotype in a population of children and adults with SCD. We will enroll a total of n=25 subjects across three different age strata (n=5 for age 6-13, n=10 for age 14-20 and n=10 for age ≥21). With a 95% level of confidence, the proposed sample of 25 would estimate the true proportion with an error margin≤0.2. If the RCM prevalence in the SCD population is ≥21% and the prevalence in a normal population does not exceed 5%, the proposed sample would also provide a ≥80% power to detect a higher RCM frequency in the SCD population. The expected (hypothesized) prevalence is 30%. Given that the expected proportion of RCM in a normal population of children and adults would be close to zero, this is an excellent power for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We will also explore whether the proportion of RCM changes across the three age strata using the Freeman-Halton extension of the Fisher exact probability test for a 2x3 contingency table. We will also quantify the extent of diffuse myocardial fibrosis using the partition coefficient of gadolinium for each participant with RCM, and perform secondary exploratory correlations with clinical, laboratory, and imaging variables.  [ADDRESS_1024423] any drop-outs to maintain complete, active enrollment of 25 in the study.   
CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     16  8.2. Aim 2: Stability of RCM phenotype In this aim, we will estimate the temporal stability (e.g., resolution, non-progression, or progression) of the RCM phenotype over a 2-year period to determine its suitability as an outcome measure for a future clinical trial.  The primary endpoint is RCM classification repeatedly diagnosed at enrollment and every year post enrollment. The proportion of changes in classification from baseline (RCM or no RCM) at the time of the [ADDRESS_1024424] performance would be the persistence of the RCM phenotype from one CMR study to the next (baseline to year 1; year 1 to year 2). Whether the degree of the RCM phenotype changes with time (e.g., progresses, or remains stable) is not a factor in this analysis, as both outcomes are biologically expected. We will conclude that the RCM phenotype by [CONTACT_749076] [ADDRESS_1024425] (<5% of the total sample size) with the CMR-defined RCM phenotype has resolution of the RCM phenotype on any follow-up CMR study. 8.3. Aim 3: Association of RCM with TRJV In this exploratory aim, we will test for association between the RCM phenotype, as the binary dependent variable, and the TRJV both as a continuous regressor and as a dichotomous (≤2.5 vs >2.5 m/s) independent variable. This dichotomy has already been established as clinically and prognostically meaningful in adults with SCD. For this secondary analysis, we will combine all the age strata into a single study population, and we will not test for this association across age strata because of small sample size in each. We also hypothesize that RCM will be associated with a higher TRJV independent of age. Analysis will be by [CONTACT_749077]. 8.4. Aim 4: Biomarkers In this exploratory aim, we will estimate the within-patient and between-patient variability of a comprehensive panel of biomarkers for heart failure, ROS production, and RAS-TGFb1 signaling, as well as a panel of clinical laboratory tests. The goal of this aim is to describe the performance characteristics of the biomarkers to determine their suitability for future clinical trials. 9.

Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     17  11. Potential Risk This study involves few risks to subjects, including: (1) discomfort from venipuncture and IV catheter placement, (2) anxiety related to echocardiography, (3) anxiety or claustrophobia during the MRI, and (4) adverse effects of the MR contrast agent, gadolinium. Echocardiography and cardiac MRI are safe, noninvasive procedures that are often performed as standard of care for children and adults with SCD to screen for or diagnose cardiopulmonary complications of SCD. The side effects of gadolinium include headache, nausea and local discomfort (at the IV site). Rarely (less than 1%) low blood pressure and light-headedness occurs. This can be treated immediately with intravenous fluids. Very rarely (less than one in one thousand), patients may be allergic to gadolinium. Allergic reactions are most commonly hives and itchy eyes, but more severe reactions have been reported. Gadolinium contrast is safe for patients with SCD who are not dehydrated. There is some evidence to suggest that gadolinium-based contrast agents may be associated with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe renal insufficiency, i.e. in patients with acute or chronic severe renal impairment [estimated GFR (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for children >2 years of age, adolescents, and adults], or acute renal failure of any cause. Adequate hydration status will be ensured before gadolinium is administered (by [CONTACT_749078]). Subjects with renal impairment, i.e. an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_1024426] agent is necessary. Information about this potential risk will be included in the informed consent document and process. There is also the possible risk of the loss of confidentiality by [CONTACT_749079] (Section 10 details the procedures to minimize this possibility). 12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality  Subject confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_473], the investigators’ associates and co-workers, and by [CONTACT_749080]. Confidentiality will be maintained according to ICH E6; 4.8.10, part O: “Records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the trial are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential.”  The investigators, their staff and associates, and the appropriate regulatory agencies may use the information included in this protocol as necessary for the conduct of the trial and the safety of subjects.  The subject/legal guardian may obtain the results of clinical labs, tests and procedures obtained for this research study.   Subjects will be identified by a unique identifier. Any publications will reflect only unique identifiers. All information related to this study will be kept in secure and locked offices.  Any clinical data on paper forms that needs to be stored separately from a participant’s official medical record will be kept in individual study binders that are secured in locked cabinets. Any data on computer will be accessible only by [CONTACT_186575]. Only members of the research team will have access to these physical and electronic files.   Study data will be shared between Study Site investigators in accordance with the HIPAA waivers signed by [CONTACT_20908]/parent/guardian.

Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     18  13. Potential Benefits This research will establish improved screening and diagnostic techniques for patients with SCD. The potential benefits of this study will mainly accrue to the class (individuals with SCD) rather than the participants. It is possible that this research will uncover a medically important issue that would benefit the participant if treated as a result of the discovery, but this is not the focus of the study. All potentially medically significant findings will be reported to the patient and his or her primary hematologist for counseling and decisions about further testing, treatment, or both. 14. Risk/Benefit Analysis The potential benefits (section 11) of participation in the study outweigh the few, generally minor risks (section 10). The formal IRB risk assessment is: slightly more than minimal risk but with potential for direct benefit to participants. 15. Protection of Human Subjects The following will be done to ensure safety of human subjects: • IRB approval will be obtained at each institution implementing this study. • All Informed Consent Forms (ICFs), including parental permission forms and assent forms where applicable must also be approved by [CONTACT_36613]. • Patients and parents will be provided with the risks and benefits and give informed consent for the study. • Assent will be sought for patients based on local/institutional IRB requirements • All Institutional (IRB and HIPPA) and NIH requirements for human studies will be met. • Exclusion criteria are in place that ensure safety of the drug and exclude vulnerable groups prone to adverse events (e.g., pregnant or lactating women are not enrolled and pregnancy tests will be performed at each visit). • Adults with diminished capacity will not be enrolled • Children will be enrolled only with proper parental permission (age <18 years) and assent (age 11 years and older) Compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines for the conduct and monitoring of this clinical trial will occur through observation of the ethical and regulatory requirements presented in ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline.  The study (protocol, informed consent, advertisements, subject information sheets, and Investigator CV and credentials) should be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) or ethics committee. Changes to the protocol will be approved by [CONTACT_749081].  Subjects must sign written informed consent prior to undergoing any study procedures.   The investigators and institutions affiliated with this study will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_184081]. 16. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan There is no Data Safety and Monitoring Board for this study because this in an non-interventional study with only yearly visits for cardiac imaging with few risks to participants. Adverse event (AE) reporting will be limited to the 30 days following each yearly study visit to capture any possible complications, whether SCD-related or not, associated with MRI, gadolinium, echocardiography, and phlebotomy/IV placement. An adverse event (AE) is defined is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study.

Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     19  The Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v4.0) criteria will be used, with SCD-specific modifications noted below (Table 3). Rationale for the modifications: SCD causes multisystem chronic, progressive organ injury and intermittent and unpredictable “crises” or vaso-occlusive complications and infections. Baseline and expected laboratory values are also different in this patient population as compared to normal individuals. If the event is not found in the CTC v4.0 criteria, the event will be captured and rated mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death per the investigator (Table 4).     Table 3.

Severity descriptors for events not found in CTC v4.0 Severity  Numerical Value  Description  Mild 1 Aware of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated; does not interfere with daily routine Moderate 2 Discomfort enough to interfere with daily routine and may require some therapeutic intervention  Severe 3 Incapacitating, significantly affects clinical status; requires therapeutic intervention  Life Threatening 4 Life-Threatening; immediate intervention required  Death  5 Adverse event causes death.   The investigator is also responsible for determination adverse event attribution to determine if the event is related the protocol (Table 5). The following table outlines these definitions:   Table 5. AE attribution definitions Unrelated The event is unrelated to the protocol.   Possibly Related The event or severity of event is not usually associated by [CONTACT_749082], but there is no strong evidence to link the event to the protocol.  Probably Related The event or severity of event is such that it can likely be correlated to a protocol activity.  Definitely Related There is a strong correlation between the event and a protocol related activity.   Expected AEs are a known sign, symptom, finding, or condition related to SCD, MRI, gadolinium, echocardiography, and phlebotomy/IV placement (Tables 6 and 7). Expected events (Grade 2-5) will be

CMR for RCM in SCD (v3.1)   
Version date:  v3.1 16Mar2016     21  Unexpected AEs will be followed until resolution (or study completion) from initial start date at which time the event will be defined as: (a) ongoing; (b) resolved or stabilized without sequelae; or (c) resolved or stabilized with sequelae. Reporting of Unexpected AEs: grades 2-5 are to be reported to the IRB according to local IRB requirements unless meeting the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE), described below.  Serious adverse Events: For the purpose of this study, an SAE is considered one that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening (an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749053], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is not attributable to the subject’s SCD (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749054]) but is at least possibly related to any study-related activity; • Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity greater than that which existed at baseline; • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or • Is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], an important medical event. Reporting of SAEs: SAEs will be reported to the IRB according to IRB policy. SAEs that require expedited reporting (within 7 calendar days of the investigator’s initial receipt of the information) are: • Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents and given the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to a participant’s participation in the research; and • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 17. Quality Assurance Monitoring Plan Monitoring will be performed to ensure the study is conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with the IRB approved protocol, the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements.   For this observational study (no intervention or therapy involved), the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute at CCHMC will monitor eligibility, consent documentation, and CRF to source data verification for the first patient enrolled and for at least 5% of the patients enrolled since the last monitor visit on an annual basis. This schedule will be subject to change based on enrollment, the degree of risk or severity of monitoring findings, and other study management issues.  At the end of each monitoring visit, findings and follow-up actions will be summarized in a monitoring report and will be provided to the study PIs. 18. Plan for Informed Consent Informed consent is an ongoing process that includes the signing of an informed consent document. Subjects are required to sign an informed consent prior to undergoing any study procedures or assessments, in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6; 4.8, “Informed Consent of Trial Subjects.”  When substantial modifications are made to the informed consent, the IRB may require that all subjects currently enrolled in the study will be re-consented; ICH E6; 4.[ADDRESS_1024429] with their questions and concerns.

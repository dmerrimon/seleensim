characterized cohort from a longitudinal study conducted by [CONTACT_173059], MD HIC #5149 “The Long 
Term Impact of Intrauterine Cocaine Exposure” (also known as “The Infant and Young Children’s 
Follow-Up Project”).  
In addition, a subgroup of 12 subjects who do not meet criteria for bipolar disorder, but who are 
“at-risk” for bipolar disorder (as they have at least one first degree relative with bipolar disorder) 
although they do not meet criteria for having the disorder.

SECTION III: RESEARCH PLAN
1.Statement of Purpose: What are the scientific aims of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested?
Purpose of the Genetic Component (formerly HIC Protocol [ZIP_CODE]): The purpose of this protocol 
is to collect blood or saliva for genetic and biochemical (to include neurotrophic and immune factors 
recently associated with mood disorders) analysis from individuals with mood disorders or an 
attention deficit disorder and healthy controls in order to look at associations between regional brain 
abnormalities and specific genotypes and biomarkers that may be associated with mood disorders 
or attention deficit disorder. The long term scientific goal of the project is to identify genetic loci, 
and alleles at those loci, that influence vulnerability to mood disorders, attention deficit disorder and 
related phenotypes, such as prefrontal dysfunction. In addition, study across the lifespan will help 
to contribute to our understanding of the interaction of genetic vulnerabilities with abnormalities in 
brain development associated with the onset of the disorders.  Prior to 5/11/2023, a sample from this 
study may have been obtained and submitted to a data repository run by [CONTACT_173060]. Samples/data from subjects newly enrolled after 5/11/2023 were no longer shared and will 
continue not to be shared unless NIH funding becomes available. Only data/specimens collected 
during the NIH funding period will be shared with NIH.
Purpose of the Imaging, and Integrated Imaging and Genetic Components (contains components 
of former HIC Protocol [ZIP_CODE]):
Primary Aims: 
Aim #1: Use a prospective longitudinal design and structural MRI to examine age-related changes in 
amygdala (AMYG) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) volumes and to examine ventral prefrontal-amygdala 
neural system regional brain morphology and chemical patterns in children with mood disorders 
compared to a healthy comparison group of children.
Hypothesis1A: At both baseline and follow-up, AMYG volumes will be lower in children with mood 
disorders compared to healthy comparison (HC) children.
Hypothesis 1B: Age-related OFC volume reductions will be greater in children with mood disorders than 
in HC.
Exploratory analyses will also be conducted to explore the possibility of volumetric differences 
across diagnostic groups and in other brain regions not hypothesized a priori.
Aim #2: Use a prospective longitudinal design and fMRI to examine age-related changes in AMYG and

Page 4 of 28OFC function in children with mood disorders compared to HC.
Hypothesis 2A: At both baseline and follow-up, AMYG activation will be greater in children with mood 
disorders compared to HC.
Hypothesis 2B: Age-related OFC activation increases will be lower in magnitude in children with mood 
disorders than in HC.
Aim #3: Use a prospective longitudinal design and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine age-
related changes in AMYG and OFC connectivity in children with mood disorders compared to HC.
Exploratory analyses will also be conducted to explore the possibility of functional and 
connectivity differences across diagnostic groups, and in a small sample at “high-risk” for bipolar 
disorder, and in other brain regions not hypothesized a priori and structure-function relationships.
Exploratory Aims:
Exploratory Aim #4: Use structural MRI, in combination with study of allelic variation in genes and 
associated biochemical factors associated with mood disorders (or behaviors that might contribute to or 
be related to mood disorders), to examine the potential modifying influence of genetic factors on volume 
abnormalities in children with mood disorders.
Hypothesis 4: The presence of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter short (“s”) allele will be 
associated with greater AMYG volume increases in children with mood disorders than in HC.
Exploratory Aim #5: Use fMRI, in combination with study of allelic variations in genes and associated 
biochemical factors associated with mood disorders (or behaviors that might contribute to or be related 
to mood disorders), to examine the potential modifying influence of genetic factors on functional 
abnormalities in children with mood disorders.
Hypothesis 5: The presence of the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) promoter short (“s”) allele will be 
associated with greater AMYG activation increases in children with mood disorders than in HC
In addition, we will study effects on MRI measures of allelic variation at other strongly favored 
candidate loci, including, for example, any specific mood disorder risk loci that may be identified over 
the course of the study. Exploratory analyses will also be performed for the potential modifying influence 
on AMYG and OFC structure and function of other demographic and clinical factors such as sex, 
medication exposure, current medications, presence of rapid-cycling, duration of illness, smoking 
history, family-loading for mood disorders, stressors and socioeconomic status.
Exploratory Aim #6: Use MRI, in combination with the study of allele variation in genes and associated 
biochemical factors and assessments of stress, to examine the potential interaction between genes and 
stress in influencing the development of AMYG-OFC circuitry and the emergence of disorders of mood 
and impulse regulation (ADHD and substance use disorders).
Hypothesis 6A: Adolescents with high stress exposure, as compared to adolescents with low stress 
exposure, will show heightened AMYG and ventral striatum response and diminished OFC response to 
emotional face stimuli.
Hypothesis 6B: Abnormal response in the AMYG-ventral striatum-OFC neural system will be associated 
with impulsive and addictive behaviors.
Hypothesis 6C: Adolescents with high stress exposure who are 5-HTTLPR (SLC6A4) “s” carriers will 
show both the greatest magnitude of circuitry dysfunction and addictive behaviors.
Exploratory Aim #7: Investigate changes in corticolimbic system functioning during emotional 
regulation and to use fMRI, before, at mid-point, and after an emotional regulation intervention, to assess 
intervention-associated changes in AMYG and OFC responses to emotional stimuli and functional 
connectivity and if incorporating actigraphy, investigate objective cross-domain peripheral measures of 
daily rhythm regularity at high temporal resolution. 
Hypothesis 7A: The emotional regulation psychotherapy treatment will be associated with 
 “normalization” of the circuitry and symptom improvement.

data about how daily rhythm’s change with BE-SMART behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Exploratory Aim #8: Use 7T MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate 
amygdala anatomy at high resolution and to study glutamate neurotransmitter levels in the amygdala
Hypothesis 8: The volume of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala will be decreased, and there will be 
differences in amygdala glutamate levels, in adolescents with mood disorders.
2.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project.  Please 
provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  When available, 
previous work in animal and/or human studies should be included.  
Prevalence and Problems of Early Misdiagnosis: 
Lifetime prevalence for mood disorders is approximately 10%.  Onset of mood disorders is increasingly 
recognized in childhood. Unfortunately, misdiagnosis is still common especially e.g. with attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as psychomotor and attentional symptoms of ADHD can be 
similar to symptoms of pediatric mood disorders. Misdiagnosis may have profound consequences, e.g. 
the exposure to stimulants or antidepressants in the children with a bipolar disorder diathesis may be 
associated with increased risk of mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], rapid-cycling, treatment resistance and impaired 
prognosis. Suffering endured by [CONTACT_173061], as well as their families and 
communities is great owing to relationship loss, disruption of school or job loss. Importantly, the risk of 
suicide in mood disorders is highest from amongst pediatric psychiatric disorders. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_173027], their pathophysiology is not understood. There is a paucity 
of study of mood disorders in children; yet the high rate of the onset of the disorders during this 
developmental stage suggests that understanding brain changes in mood disorders during this period may 
be pi[INVESTIGATOR_173028].  Moreover, diagnosis and treatment of mood disorders in 
children are extrapolated from adults; yet, the potential biological differences between adolescents and 
adults with mood disorders are not known.  Thus understanding of mood disorders in children is 
important because it could contribute: key information to understanding the pathophysiology of mood 
disorders; to improved early detection, minimizing misdiagnoses and deleterious medication exposure; 
to understanding of potentially unique characteristics of mood disorders in children, as compared to 
mood disorders in adulthood, so that treatment strategies may be more specifically targeted; to early 
detection and targeted early interventions that could improve lifetime prognosis; and, as we have argued, 
the understanding of brain structure and function in children attainable through neuroimaging studies, 
may be critical for understanding pediatric mood disorders. This work could also have broad implications 
as it could contribute to understanding of normal and disordered developmental trajectories of amygdala-
OFC neural systems in childhood for which little human data is available, and that is especially important 
as adolescence is associated with a sharp increase in the risk for many other psychopathologies as well 
as suicide.
MRI Studies in BD to Implicate Amygdala and Orbitofrontal Cortex in Mood Disorders:
Abnormalities in AMYG and OFC volume in adult mood disorders have been reported; however, studies 
of pediatric mood disorders are rare.  We recently reported AMYG volume decreases in adolescents and 
adults with bipolar disorder (BD) (Blumberg et al. 2003), suggesting that AMYG volume deficits are 
early and stable abnormalities in BD.  In adults with mood disorders, increased AMYG activity has been 
reported in subjects at rest as well as during emotional face recognition.  Decreased OFC activity at rest 
and a relative failure of right OFC activation in mania have been demonstrated during word generation 
and decision-making tasks (Blumberg et al. 1999).  Recent fMRI work by [CONTACT_173062], and found a shift in abnormalities to the left 
caudal OFC in association with depression. Furthermore, we found a relative failure of rostral OFC to

Page 6 of 28activate that persisted across elevated, depressed and euthymic mood states (36 BD vs. 22 healthy 
subjects, p<0.005) suggesting that impaired function in this region may represent a diathesis to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_173029] (Blumberg et al. 2003). In adolescents, our fMRI data support activation increases in 
subcortical components of OFC neural systems, and emerging abnormalities in OFC, in adolescents with 
BD (Blumberg et al. 2003).
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_173030]:
 Longitudinal Within-Subject Structural MRI Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]:
Amygdala: [ADDRESS_202491] remained consistent, i.e. at each time point AMYG volumes were 
smaller in BD than in HC (p<0.05).
OFC: We used nonrigid registration methods to examine local volume changes between first and second 
scans within and across diagnostic groups. Consistent with our hypotheses, as well as our cross-sectional 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we observed greater interval-related decreases in volume in the OFC in BD as compared to 
HC adolescents.  Whereas HC (N=9) showed approximately 1% decrease in VPFC volume in the 2year 
period during adolescence (consistent with the literature on prefrontal change during this developmental 
period), BD (N=10) showed from 3-6% decreased in this region.  Moreover, this new technique 
permitted us to examine whole brain to observe the particular regions of group differences.  The 
localization of significant group differences encompassed the same regions where we have previously 
observed age-related changes in adolescence and functional deficits in patients with BD on both 
emotional and cognitive tasks.
Functional MRI Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]: 
Amygdala: In an fMRI study, we employed an emotional face task (happy, sad, fearful and neutral face 
conditions). Comparing 17 HC and 5 BD subjects we found significantly elevated activation (p<0.05) in 
right AMYG in BD, and interestingly the group x condition interaction was significant with the greatest 
group differences in the happy condition.  This interaction is of interest as the processing of positively 
valenced emotional stimuli has been theorized to distinguish pediatric BD from other psychiatric 
disorders. 
OFC: In the first published study of fMRI in adolescent BD, we observed age-related increases in OFC 
engagement during task performance in HC adolescents. This age effect was diminished in adolescents 
with BD suggesting that abnormalities in the development over adolescence of OFC function contribute 
to OFC deficits observed in adults with BD (Blumberg et al. 2003). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_173031] (p<0.005), 
consistent with our previous findings in BD, and within the region where the longitudinal structural data 
demonstrate accelerated volume loss.
Genetic Factors with the Potential to Modify Regional Brain Volume in BD:
A phenotype provided by [CONTACT_173063] a particular genotype may be considered 
an “intermediate” phenotype, possibly an endophenotype, which reflects the effect of the functional 
variant more directly than DSM-IV diagnosis. The identification of a neural endophenotype could 
therefore help to clarify classification and diagnosis, as well as develop animal models an important 
issue in BD for which no good animal model is available.  The particular genetic variation with which 
the endophenotype is associated provides a biochemical mechanism that can be further studied for its 
influence on the pathophysiology of the disorder as well as a mechanism to target with new treatments.
 Modifying Influence of Genotypes on Amygdala Function in BD: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]:
The data above was examined for potential increases in AMYG activity in association with the serotonin 
transporter promoter protein SLC6A4 “s” allele. We found that BD subjects who are "s" carriers (i.e. 
“ss” or “ls”) have significantly higher left AMYG volume as well as activation (p<0.05) than those with 
"ll" genotype.  This suggests that the “s” allele may influence a shift in neuroprotection towards greater

Page 7 of 28volume but that volume increases may be associated with some maladaptive functional features such as 
abnormal emotional processing. 
Note: While we have focused on the AMYG and OFC in this proposal, other brain structures 
including medial temporal regions such as the hippocampus and other frontocortical structures have 
also been implicated in BD.  Exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate potential group 
differences in these and other brain regions identified as potential regions of difference on whole 
brain structural and functional analyses.
Salutary Effects of Psychotherapy:
New treatments to help to reduce the emotional dysregulation of mood disorders are critically needed.  
We are continuing to study an emotional dysregulation psychotherapy treatment in which subjects learn 
skills to help to down-regulate maladaptive emotional responses and learn beneficial, healthy sleep and 
activity habits. We repeat scanning and symptom and behavioral assessments at the midpoint, and after 
the psychotherapy is completed.  This collected information will demonstrate that the treatment can help 
subjects to better self-regulate their emotional responses and behaviors, reducing abnormalities in neural 
circuitry responses and their symptoms. 
Incorporating the actigraphy device and EMA data has potential to generate novel scientific insights into 
the brain and behavioral mechanisms underlying beneficial effects of daily rhythm regularization on the 
emotional circuitry target. 
3.Research Plan: Please provide an orderly scientific description of the study design and research 
procedures as they directly affect the subjects. Please note: Investigators should take care to 
distinguish clearly between any procedures that are experimental and those that are part of 
subjects’ standard clinical care.
 Procedures:
After written informed parental permission is obtained from a parent/guardian of subjects under age 18 
years or written informed consent from subjects 18 years old or greater (and written informed assent in 
subjects <18 years of age), interviews (about 3 - 4 and ½ hours) will be performed at the Yale University 
School of Medicine, blood draws for genetic and biochemical (to include levels of neurotrophic and 
immune factors) testing will be performed by a certified phlebotomist at our lab or at the YCCI HRU, 
and urine toxicology will be performed at either the YCCI HRU or at the Yale University School of 
Medicine. (Obtaining blood and urine will take about 15 minutes if done at our lab and ½ hour if taken 
from YCCI HRU which includes the walk to the 10th floor at YCCI HRU and the return walk to Anylan 
Center).  For the Mayes sample, the blood sample may already have been obtained for genetic study, and 
therefore a blood sample may not need to be redrawn.  Results of the urine toxicology will be discussed 
only with the subject, including if the subject is a minor. Subjects who are unable to give a blood sample 
but wish to participate in genetic testing may opt to give a saliva sample by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_17270] a tube until it is 
filled to a certain level.  The saliva sample process may take up to 20 minutes.  Children and their parents 
will be interviewed separately and together.  Scanning will be performed on the 3T system at the Anlyan 
Center at the Yale University School of Medicine. The scanning session will be 90 minutes long. Further 
interview information will be collected from the parent during the scanning session in an office on the 
same level as the scanner in case the child requests their parent during scanning. For follow-up subjects, 
assessments will follow similar procedures, including pregnancy tests for menstruating females; 
however, interviews are anticipated to be brief. Diagnosis will be confirmed and clinical changes 
recorded such as interim epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], treatment changes and social changes that might affect SES. Genetic 
testing need not be repeated.  We anticipate that total participation will take approximately [ADDRESS_202492].

Assessment of Pregnancy:
The risks of study with pregnancy and the possibility of pregnancy will be discussed with each 
menstruating female subject by [CONTACT_173069]. A urine screening will be performed within 
[ADDRESS_202495] the woman would also be excluded from study.  
Female subjects of childbearing potential will require urine pregnancy testing prior to MRI 
scanning. Because full confidentiality regarding pregnancy cannot be entirely guaranteed, these testing 
requirements and the limited scope of confidentiality will be made known to all subjects during the 
consent procedure. In this manner, young women who would not be comfortable with pregnancy testing 
or sharing the results of such testing can opt out of the study at the time of the initial consent, without 
having to declare specific reasons. Subjects 13 or older will be told the results. 
Females of child bearing potential will be notified that it may not be safe to participate while 
pregnant and if pregnant will not be enrolled.  If they would like to become pregnant during the course 
of the study, then they should not participate.  Pregnancy testing will be done prior to scanning on all 
female subjects and any positive tests will exclude further participation.
FMRI Paradigm-Related Behavioral Testing:
Before scanning, subjects will be asked to practice paper and computerized versions of the tasks that will 
be given to them in the scanner to familiarize them with the neuropsychological stimuli. Accuracy and 
response time data will be collected.  Further testing, e.g. regarding memory for stimuli during scanning 
may be administered briefly after scanning.
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_173034]:  All blood tubes or saliva samples will be labeled with a code 
that contains no personal identifying information. DNA extraction and genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_173035]. Gelernter’s laboratory. DNA will be extracted from [ADDRESS_202496] 
processed MRI data sent to the University of Iowa as part of a GWAS. Yale is not receiving information 
from University of Iowa for this study.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Acquisition:  
MRI scans will be obtained using the 3T scanner in the MR Center in the Yale Anlyan building. Head 
position will be secured with foam pads and Velcro strap across the forehead and standardized using 
canthomeatal landmarks. A 90 minute protocol will include acquisition of high resolution structural MRI 
data, MRS, fMRI data and DTI data.  With exception of the fMRI component, subjects will lie still with 
their eyes closed.  During the fMRI component subjects may perform a neuropsychological task. These 
tasks will involve the presentation of visual or auditory stimuli related to cognitive or emotional 
functions.   They will not include material that would be considered offensive, threatening or degrading. 
Visual stimuli may be words, stars, pi[INVESTIGATOR_173036]-projected using an active matrix LCD projection system. The subjects view the images using a 
mirror system.  Tasks may alternate to provide information at baseline (e.g. while passively viewing a 
cross hatch on a screen), during an activation task of interest (e.g. during a Stroop interference task while 
naming the color of the letters in words when the words do not match the color such as "blue" written in

Stroop task naming the color of words presented in the congruent colors such as "blue" in blue letters) 
and responses will be made by [CONTACT_173070] a fiber optic response box.  
If a response box is used, accuracy and time of response will be recorded.
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_173037] 52 subjects enrolled in the NIH-funded R21 on the 7T 
scanner: At 7T, high-resolution images were implemented with the goal of differentiation of the internal 
regions of the amygdala.  These were T1-weighted, T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, or another 
approach, as necessary was used to achieve the sensitivity and contrast required for visualization of the 
amygdala's substructures.  SAR and gradient strengths were maintained within FDA limits.  Scan times 
were limited to [ADDRESS_202497] in less time.
MRS Acquisition:
Total 7T scanning time, including MRS, was 90 minutes. Single- or multi-voxel H-MRS scans 
were used to obtain proton spectra from regions of the frontal and/or occipi[INVESTIGATOR_173038], as well, using surface coils or volume coils. The single voxels measure 4-27 cubic centimeters 
in size and located based on the structural scans.  Details of voxel construction and placement evolved 
as the MRS physicists of the Yale Magnetic Resonance Center developed new MRS acquisition 
protocols.  MRS spectra was collected from the voxel(s) of interest.  GABA was acquired using PRESS 
localization and J-editing, using an echo time of as close to 68ms as possible.  Glutamate was measured 
using short-echo MRS, with an echo time as low as possible, ideally less than 15ms.
BE-SMART Psychotherapy Treatment:
Subjects with or “at-risk” of mood disorders are invited to participate in the psychotherapy 
treatment trial. The testing assesses acceptability to subjects and ability to engage the brain targets, and 
the treatment will be adapted to optimize helpfulness to the subjects, as compared to burden. Subjects 
participating in our scanning studies frequently request opportunities to participate in treatment studies.  
This provides free, non-medication treatment. The treatment is overseen by a licensed mental health 
professional. The treatment is designed to increase healthy emotional regulation and behavioral habits 
(such as sleep and activity). The treatment provided in this study will be in addition to subjects’ current 
treatment, as the study treatment is considered an adjunctive treatment.
          Subjects may participate in [ADDRESS_202498] about 1 hour each. These therapy sessions may be videotaped and 
audiotaped (only with the written consent of the subject, and when appropriate, the subject’s parent or 
guardian). Subjects may be asked to complete weekly worksheets (either through qualtrics or by [CONTACT_173071]) and practice the skills learned from these sessions and they may be asked questions about how 
they are feeling. There may be an interview assessment and scan performed at baseline, midpoint and at 
the completion of the psychotherapy sessions to review progress for the BE-SMART subjects. As it is 
often challenging for subjects to come to the site, we will conduct sessions by [CONTACT_173072] 
(Zoom) and plan that approximately 50-75% of the sessions will occur via such methods. 
Subjects participating in the R61 Supplement will receive the psychotherapy treatment the actigraphy 
and EMA electronic diary devices. We ask that subjects use the provided actigraphy device in place of 
any current personal activity tracker they may be using, or if not cumbersome, in conjunction with their 
own device for the duration of the study.  The actigraph is widely used in research settings, including 
with our NIMH intramural collaborators on this funded Supplement with whom we will be sharing 
deidentified information with their computational team.  The EMA electronic diary will allow us to 
monitor changes in subject’s emotions, behavior, and activities and show us how these measures change

MRI Data Processing: 
Image processing and analysis will be performed at the Yale MR Center on UNIX workstations using 
standard as well as locally developed software. Data are stripped of all identifying information and 
assigned a numerical code so that image processors are blind to subject information.  Processing will 
include transformation of brains across subjects into common stereotactic space. Pre-existing subjects 
who had consented to share their samples and data may have their post processed MRI data along with 
de-identified information in computer files about their processed samples sent to the University of Iowa 
as part of a GWAS. Yale is not receiving information from University of Iowa for this study.

Ralitza Gueorguieva, PhD (EPH) and James Dziura, PhD (GCRC). For example, to test hypothesis #1: 
diagnosis will be the between subject’s variable.  Hemisphere (right vs. left) and time (1st scan vs. 2nd 
scan) will be the within-subject variables and there will be a random subject effect.  Repeated measures 
will be performed over the spatial domain of hemisphere. Total brain volume will be included as a 
covariate to control for general scaling effects. Terms that are not significant (p>0.05) will be eliminated 
via a backward stepwise algorithm, with the constraint that the model at each step is hierarchically well-
formulated. Least squares means (ls means) and standard errors (SE) will be calculated in the mixed 
model and plotted to interpret significant interactions.
Whole brain analyses will also be performed to examine for group differences in regions not 
hypothesized a priori.  These will be performed with widely available software such as SPM software 
as well locally developed software.
Power:
Effect sizes, calculated based upon pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], are large for testing of main hypotheses.  For 
example, the mean difference in AMYG volumes between BD and HC subjects was [ADDRESS_202502] size of 1.14.  Mean reductions in volume in the OFC ROI of 3.35±1.73% in 
BD subjects compared to reductions of 0.78±3.40% in HC subjects.  The absolute difference of 2.[ADDRESS_202503] size (d) of 0.93.  A sample size of 50 subjects per group will provide 
>95% power to detect differences of this magnitude even at attrition rates as large as 30%.

Overall Recruitment Efforts: Through a variety of efforts, subjects will be informed about our study.  
These efforts will include educational presentations, and websites (e.g. Craig’s List, FaceBook, YCCI 
website, and the Yale University Department of Psychiatry website).  
The flyers will be widely distributed (e.g., within school systems given prior authorized permission to 
do so) and placed at varied locations throughout the community. We will also be sending out information 
packets to area clinicians in private practice, group practices, community agencies, and public-school 
systems (e.g. school counselors). 
Potential subjects or their referrers may call the research staff directly.  A telephone screen is 
administered with the study procedures and potential risks and inclusion and exclusion criteria explained 
in detail over the telephone to the referrer or parent/guardian and the child.  If eligible and interested, an 
in-person appointment will be scheduled to obtain written informed consent and assent.  If the 
parent/guardian agrees to consider having their child participate then a follow up in-person appointment 
will be scheduled to obtain written informed consent and assent.  
Additional Methods of Recruitment of Individuals with Mood Disorders and/or ADHD: Study inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and procedures will be discussed with clinicians from the Yale Medical Center 
and the Yale Child Study Center (CSC) as well as treaters in the surrounding community. We will recruit 
through referral sites of the CSC including satellite programs such as Cedarhurst therapeutic school and 
affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_173041], including Bridgeport Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We have clinicians who are 
collaborators on both inpatient and outpatient adolescent and young adult clinical programs of Yale New 
Haven Psychiatric Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We will provide written information about the study to inform them, and so 
that they may provide the written materials to parents/guardians of potential subjects. The 
parent/guardian would then be able to contact [CONTACT_173079]. However, if the treating 
clinician is one of the study investigators, the treating clinician will be able to enroll the participant 
directly. Participants may also call the research coordinator after viewing the HIC approved 
advertisement for this study. 
Additional Methods of Recruitment of Healthy Participants:  Controls will be recruited through word-

Follow-up visit:
Subjects will be instructed not to drink any alcohol or use any other substances within [ADDRESS_202506] Population: Provide a detailed description of the proposed involvement of human subjects.  
Describe the characteristics of the subject population, including their anticipated number, age range 
and health status.
The selection of subjects should be equitable. Generally speaking, subject selection should reflect a 
reasonable cross-section of the population that is being studied.  In research that requires a more 
restricted population, the rationale for this need should be fully justified.  Investigators must also 
provide scientific justification for the exclusion of underrepresented populations such as women, 
children, or minorities. 
Subjects will be age 13 years or older but under age 31. We plan to include equal numbers of males  
and females (inclusion of sex assigned at birth) and minority subjects in proportions representative of 
the population in the greater New Haven area. However, specifically for the Mayes sample, the 
adolescent cohort is primarily minority, with 60% African-American, 14% Hispanic, and 26% 
Caucasian. 
There will be no increase to the target enrollment with the addition of the psychotherapy pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
Subjects already participating in the imaging component of the study will be invited to participate in 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_173043], with an initial aim of pi[INVESTIGATOR_28882] 10 subjects. 
There will be an increase of 86 BD adolescent/young adult subjects to the target enrollment with the 
addition of the BE-SMART and Supplement.  These subjects will be 16 to 30 years old at entry and 
will participate in open trials, 50% randomized to either the BE-SMART-DR or BE-SMART-ER. 
With an estimate of 20% attrition, there will be 26 completers per group.  An additional 13 “at risk” 
for bipolar disorder adolescent subjects, who will not be randomized, but participate in the BE-
SMART-DR psychotherapy.
4.Vulnerable Subjects:  Certain populations are considered vulnerable and require special protections 
when asked to participate in a research study.  (Vulnerable populations include, but are not limited to 
pregnant women, fetuses, human embryos, prisoners, children, and cognitively impaired individuals 
or persons with questionable capacity to consent.  Others which may require special consideration 
include elderly persons, economically disadvantaged persons and educationally disadvantaged 
persons.)
Children include all persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or 
procedures involved in the research under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research 
will be conducted (the age of majority is 18 years in the Connecticut).  Parental permission and the 
child’s assent are required for participation in the study.  (Assent is defined as “a child’s affirmative 
agreement to participate in research” and should be sought in addition to parental permission when 
the minor subject is sufficiently mature to understand the nature of his or her participation in a 
Research study.)  Please refer to the HIC Guidelines for Investigators at

a justification for their involvement.  Also, address any additional safeguards necessary to protect the 
rights and welfare of vulnerable subjects.  
All study personnel working with this child/adolescent/adult population will have completed Good 
Clinical Practice trainings.  Both written parental permission and the child’s assent will be obtained 
for all minor subjects under the age of 18 who were invited to participate.  Literature supports that 
although the age range encompasses a period of neurodevelopmental change, some subcortical system 
components are relatively stable by [CONTACT_173081].  The amygdala, a key target, has a 
developmental peak by [CONTACT_654] 16 years, and can be expected to be relatively stable in structure and 
function levels in the child/adolescent/young adults. We reported amygdala volume decreases and 
associated activation increases to emotional faces in adolescents with BD in this age range, considered 
some of the most replicated biological findings in BD.  It is possible that the magnitude of target 
engagement could vary by [CONTACT_654], and this would be important to study.  This would be in-line with our 
overall program of research.
SECTION VI: CONSENT/ASSENT PROCEDURES
1.Consent Personnel: Please list all personnel who will be obtaining consent.
SEE IRES RECORD
2.Assessment of Capacity to Consent: For research involving subjects with limited decision-making 
capacity, how will the capacity to consent be assessed?
All guardians and subjects [ADDRESS_202507] be capable for providing informed consent 
and subjects under 18 years of age of informed assent.
3.Process of Consent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent will be obtained, 
including the information that will be communicated to the subject, any steps taken to minimize 
undue influence, and any steps taken to enhance subjects’ independent decision-making (such as a 
waiting period between the consent discussion and obtaining consent).
Subjects are consented on a 1:[ADDRESS_202508] and the parent/guardian.  The subject and 
parent/guardian are encouraged to stop the staff member and ask questions along the way.  In 
addition, the staff member anticipates questions and describes anything that seems unclear in more 
detail.  After reading the consent form, the subject and parent/guardian are asked again if they have 
any questions.  Any questions are answered.  Then they are asked by [CONTACT_173082]/guardian will permit the child to participate and the child whether he/she wishes to participate 
in the study.  This enhances independent decision-making by [CONTACT_173083]. We will require written informed 
permission by a parent or guardian for their child’s participation in this study, as well as written 
informed assent by [CONTACT_2252].

SECTION VII: PROTECTION OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS
1.Risks: What are the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or inconveniences associated with 
participation in the research?
Please note: Potential research risks include more than physical harm; risks may also include, for 
example, emotional or psychological harm, risk of social stigmatization, economic or legal risk.
Diagnostic Assessment, Symptom Rating and Neuropsychological Testing
Discussing symptoms or past experiences, seeing emotional stimuli or taking cognitive tests can 
sometimes be stressful.
Blood Draw
Pain, bruises, inflammation, blood clot, bleeding, and/or infection can sometimes occur at the 
phlebotomy site.  Very rarely syncope can occur during phlebotomy.
Saliva Sample
Donating saliva is not harmful. If a subject gives a saliva sample, their mouth may become dry from 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_173049].
Confidentiality
Loss of confidentiality is another potential hazard of any research protocol.  Specific confidentiality 
concerns are associated with genetic information.  The investigators follow a system of specific 
precautions to ensure the confidentiality of genetic data generated by [CONTACT_173087]; see Section VIII “Confidentiality of Data” below.
We were issued a Certificate of Confidentiality on 5/24/23.
Subjects in Psychotherapy and Supplement Study:
The therapy is designed to help to develop more healthy ways to regulate emotions and more 
healthy sleep and activity patterns. It is possible that the subject could feel worse during the treatment.  
If the subject does, the subject is free to stop at any time. If the subject wishes, we can help to inform 
their treater.
The subject may be asked to utilize a computer or phone for sessions via 
videotelecommunication, wear the actigraphy device, use the EMA electronic diary and fill out self-
reports through Qualtrics. There is a risk of loss of confidentiality with use of the internet. The subject 
will be asked to do sessions in a location where the subject can speak confidentially. There is no 
identifiable data on the actigraphy device or EMA diary device and neither have GPS or any other 
location recording capability.  Deidentified raw activity, emotional, and behavioral data is downloaded 
to a desktop app and converted to a .csv file that only the researchers on this project can match to subjects.  
The subject may find that the actigraph provided to them is uncomfortable to wear on their wrist. If this 
occurs, the subject can opt not to wear the device without this affecting their participation in the other 
parts of the study. If the devices are lost, there is no way to track the device back to the user as neither 
holds personally identifying information.

Page 20 of 282.Minimizing Risks: How will the above-mentioned risks be minimized?
Diagnostic Assessment and Symptom Rating
Discussing symptoms or past experiences can sometimes be stressful. These procedures will be described 
to the subject, and if applicable, to the parent/guardian.  Not all subjects are referred by [CONTACT_173088], but if 
they are, these procedures will also be explained to the referring treater as well.  A subject will be 
excluded from study if there is a contraindication to these procedures.  Interviewers will be specifically 
trained to collect only information necessary for the purposes of this study.  Interviews are to be 
conducted in a professional and skillful manner.
If there is an acute concern that a subject could be a danger to himself/herself or others, he/she will be 
escorted to the emergency room, or if necessary the study staff will activate the EMS system/Police 
(911).  If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_173050] a subject is in need of psychiatric care, a referral will be 
given to that subject.  If a subject asks that information from the diagnostic interview be communicated 
to his/her outside treater, an investigator from the study will provide the requested information to the 
treater.
If an individual contacts our program and asks for a referral, or, if an enrolled subject is in need of 
psychiatric care, we provide names and phone numbers of referrals. If the person wishes, we are happy 
to facilitate the intake. If a subject/parent/guardian expresses significant distress during the screening 
process, we obtain their contact [CONTACT_173089] [INVESTIGATOR_173051]. If the subject/parent/guardian has an outside clinician it will 
be recommended that they talk with their clinician and, if they wish, we will speak with the clinician. If 
the subject/parent/guardian is judged by [CONTACT_173090]/parent/guardian will be told to contact [CONTACT_173091], go to the 
emergency room, or if unwilling, the outside clinician and 911 may be called.
If a parent/guardian of a subject requested a referral for themselves, and/or appeared in need of 
psychiatric care, we provide names and phone numbers of referrals. If the person wishes, we are happy 
to facilitate the intake. If a parent/guardian expresses distress and/or suicidal ideation, then the PI [INVESTIGATOR_173052]/or a licensed clinician of the program will evaluate the situation. If the 
subject/parent/guardian has an outside clinician it will be recommended that they talk with their clinician 
and, if they wish, we will speak with the clinician. If the parent/guardian is judged by [CONTACT_173092]/guardian will be escorted to the emergency room, or if unwilling the 
outside clinician and [ADDRESS_202509], and if applicable, to the 
parent/guardian.  If there is any question as to whether a subject might find such stimuli or task 
disturbing, they will not be exposed to the stimuli.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy (MRI and MRS)
Magnetic resonance (MR) is a technique that uses magnetism and radio waves, not x-rays, to take 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_57180].  The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has set guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves, and we carefully 
observe those guidelines.  
  The subject will be watched closely throughout the study.  Some people may feel uncomfortable or 
anxious.  If this happens to the subject, they may ask to stop the study at any time and we will take them out 
of the MR scanner.  On occasion, some people might feel dizzy, fatigued, get an upset stomach, have a 
metallic taste or feel tingling sensations or muscle twitches, possible headaches from the noise, back/neck 
aches from lying still.  These sensations usually go away quickly but the subject is asked to tell the research 
staff if they have any of these symptoms.  The subject is given a rubber ball to hold in their hand during the

Page [ADDRESS_202510]’s scan, a radiologist will be asked to review the relevant images.  Based on his or her recommendation 
(if any), the primary investigator or consulting physician will contact [CONTACT_423], inform them of the finding 
regarding their scan, and recommend that the subject seek medical advice as a precautionary measure.  The 
decision for additional examination or treatment would lie solely with the subject and their physician.  The 
investigators, the consulting physician, the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, and Yale University are 
not responsible for any examination or treatment that the subject receives based on these findings.  The 
images collected in this study are not a clinical MR exam and for that reason, they will not be made available 
for diagnostic purposes.
Scanner anxiety will be diminished by [CONTACT_173093]. Every effort will be made to ensure the comfort of subjects while in the 
MRI scanner. Subjects will be communicated with frequently by [CONTACT_173094]. Subjects may discontinue at any time if they wish 
due to any mental or physical discomfort or any other reason.  It will be made clear that the participation 
is completely voluntary and that if the subject is a patient of the Yale Medical Center then his/her 
decision will in no way affect his/her treatment.  A study session will also be terminated if there is 
unexpected technical difficulty that precludes the safe and efficient performance of the study.
While there are no known risks associated with MRI and pregnancy it is standard clinical practice 
to avoid MRI scans in pregnancy when possible and therefore there is not a large pool of data.  Given 
this, pregnant subjects will be excluded from study.
Scanning is performed at The Anlyan Center on the campus of the Yale University Medical 
Center so that emergency medical intervention is available in the event of an adverse event.
Blood Draw
Only personnel from our lab or the YCCI-HRU trained in phlebotomy will perform the blood draws. 
The YCCI-HRU has agreed to provide nurses experienced in blood draws in children and adults.
Confidentiality of Data
Biological materials (blood or saliva) for DNA studies collected from individuals are identified by a 
letter and number code rather than by [CONTACT_2300]. For this genetic component, the samples that are brought to 
[CONTACT_173097]’s laboratory for storage and analysis are coded with a letter and number code that does not 
contain personal identifiers. Accompanying demographic information is limited to age, sex, diagnosis,

Page 22 of 28and ethnicity/race. Scans are also identified by [CONTACT_105751]. No genotype data are released to subjects 
or clinicians, or are recorded in the medical record, under any circumstances.
To protect subject confidentiality, subjects will be assigned a letter and number code that will be 
used when performing data analysis.  Paper study documents that contain identifying information will 
be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked office in the investigator’s locked research suite.  The letter and 
number codes with the link to subject identifiers will be stored in a separate computer file on the Yale 
University fileserver and access will be limited to authorized personnel.  This file will be backed-up in 
encrypted form using Yale University encryption software and will be stored on office desktop 
computers, as well as CDs stored in a locked file cabinet, in a locked office in the investigator’s locked 
research suite. Some subject information will also be stored on unencrypted electronic databases, but 
these databases will contain only de-identified data.  Laptops and computers will be pass-word protected. 
After the study is closed and all data analysis is complete, all identifiers will be removed.  The 
code will continue to be stored in a secure location to verify data should that be necessary. All other 
personally identifying information will be removed and deleted using the appropriate methods (e.g. 
zeroing). These records will be destroyed according with policies regarding length of time that research 
documents need to be retained after protocol completion. 
Fate of DNA to be studied and issues of DNA "banking": DNA samples from participants will be 
retained for future study. This is clearly indicated in the informed consent. A subject or the 
parent/guardian of a minor subject may request that we destroy the code linking the identifiers of the 
subject with their DNA sample, so that the sample would only be studied anonymously from that point 
forward.
3.Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Please include a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that 
includes an explicit statement of overall risks, addresses attribution and grading of adverse events 
and describes procedures for monitoring the ongoing progress of the research and reporting adverse 
events.  For more information, please see the HIC website: 
http://info.med.yale.edu/hic/forms/index.html
This protocol presents greater than minimal risks to the subjects and adverse events are not anticipated 
but the potential exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur 
since it is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods.  In the unlikely event that adverse events occur, 
serious unanticipated adverse events will be reported within 48 hours to the HIC (using HIC form 6A) 
and within [ADDRESS_202511] for re-approval application 
to the HIC.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_173053]-year intervals and determine whether the adverse and unexpected events affects the Risk/Benefit 
ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (at Risks to subjects) or consent form (at 
Risks and Inconveniences) are required. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_173054].

Page [ADDRESS_202512] be conducted at a minimum of 
every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is sought).  During the review process, the 
principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require 
modification/amendment, or close to enrollment.  The principal investigator, the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) or the HIC or the NIMH have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require 
modifications
For the psychotherapy study, the Independent Safety Monitor (ISM), Laura Ment, is an 
independent physician and appropriate expert with relevant expertise whose primary 
responsibility is to provide independent monitoring of the clinical trial.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed for the following reasons: (choose those 
that apply)
1. We do not view the risks associated with the psychotherapy intervention as minimal risks.
2. We do not view the risks associated with the combined use of (not apply) and (not apply) as 
minimal risks.
3. Given the now established safety and validity of the current psychotherapy intervention in our 
prior work, we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
4. Given our experience with the combined co-administration (not apply), we do not view the 
proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible 
to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience 
with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the 
proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] (Hilary Blumberg, MD) according with the following 
categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe

Page 24 of 285. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it:
1. Death;
2. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_173055]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol 
and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; AND 
2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-
medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse 
events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note that adverse events are reportable to 
the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt 
reporting requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_202513]

Page 25 of 28to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring entity that is monitoring the study on behalf of an industry 
sponsor).
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s 
research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study sponsors, funding and 
regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies.
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory
agencies will be notified: (choose those that apply)

□ Other Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or Committee (DSMC)
The principal investigator (Hilary Blumberg, MD) will conduct a review of all adverse events upon 
completion of every study subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_173056].
Please note: For any study that may be considered high risk, the IRB will be more focused on the safety 
requirements for the study and a DSMB will likely be required. 
4.Confidentiality and Security of Data: 
a) Will private identifiable information about individuals be collected and used? Yes, such data will 
be collected and recorded during semi-structured interviews with the parent/guardian and the 
subject. Mood disorders subjects will also be asked to sign a request to obtain/release their 
specific data they elect to/from Yale and their treatments providers.  
b) How will research data be collected and recorded?  Investigators are reminded that subject 
identifiers and the means to link subject names and codes with research data should not be stored 
on unencrypted moveable media, (e.g., laptops, compact discs, jump drives, thumb drives).  
Identifiers and code keys must be stored in a secure manner, e.g., Yale network servers. 
Biological materials (blood or saliva) for biochemical DNA studies that are collected from individuals 
are identified by [CONTACT_173095]. For the biochemical and genetic components, the 
samples that are brought to [CONTACT_173097]’s laboratory for storage and analysis are coded with a letter

d) What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality of subjects and their 
data? (Note: data security plan must include methods to secure all information gathered about an 
individual during the recruitment, screening and participation phases.) Investigators must use 
encryption methods to protect access to files that contain identifiable research data that are 
stored on moveable media.  Other data security methods may be appropriate for other, not 
directly identifiable types of research data.   
Please see Confidentiality of Data section above.
e) What mechanisms are in place to ensure proper use and continued protection of these data? 
Please see Confidentiality of Data section above.
f) Describe any limits to confidentiality, e.g., legal requirements for disclosure of reportable 
diseases, abuse of child or elder, danger to self or others. 
Limits exist for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_173057].
g) What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Researchers are reminded that 
subject permission must be obtained to retain personally identifiable research data for future 
research purposes. Researchers are also reminded that deleting data or reformatting disks is not 
sufficient for removing personally identifiable information or data. Zeroing, degaussing or other 
method must be used to remove these types of identifiers or data. 
 Please see Confidentiality of Data section above. Once all data for this project has been 
collected and results of these studies published, study data which has been stripped of all subject 
identifiers will be available to other qualified researchers. Any such request for study data which 
meets reasonable standards of scientific integrity will be considered. 
h) Will any external or internal individuals or agencies charged with monitoring (such as the study 
sponsor, FDA, QUACS, SSC, etc.) have access to study data? 
Records can only be revealed in accordance with Yale HIC policy.
i) If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained?  For more information, please 
see the HIC website: http://www.med.yale.edu/hic/policy/CofC.pdf  
Yes, this protocol was granted a Certificate of Confidentiality that will be uploaded in

SECTION VIII: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: For studies offering treatment, what treatment alternatives are available outside of 
the research?  
Please note: Some categories of non-treatment research may also require a section outlining 
alternatives to participation.  For example, a study that provides screening for a particular 
illness or condition should state whether testing is available outside of the research.    
Subjects have the option to decline participation, or if they have initially agreed to participate to 
withdraw their participation at any time during the study.
2.Payments for participation (Economic Considerations):  Describe any payments that will be 
made to subjects (including direct monetary payment, payment in the form of a gift, or 
reimbursement for costs such as travel, parking, childcare, etc.), and the conditions for receiving 
this compensation.  
All subjects will be paid for all parts of this study in which they participate.  Subjects do not have 
to do all the parts to participate in this study.
1. Subjects will be compensated $30 for their time participation in the initial interview.
2. Subjects will be compensated $30 for their time participation in cognitive testing. 
3. Subjects will be compensated $50 for their time participation in the MRI session.
4. Subjects will be compensated $30 for their time participating in a blood/saliva sample collection 
for biochemical and DNA study.
Subjects will additionally be compensated for reasonable travel expenses and if parking at 
Temple Street or Temple Medical garage the subject will be reimbursed $15 if 3 hours or under 
and $[ADDRESS_202516] participates for more than 3 consecutive hours 
we will additionally provide lunch or refreshments in the amount of $10 each per parent/guardian 
and child. If it becomes necessary for subjects to return for an unanticipated, additional visit to 
complete some part/s of the study the subject will be reimbursed appropriately.  Any other 
reasonable expenses will be made per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].
There are no plans at present to use the DNA samples for any commercial uses.  However, if a 
discovery from research on DNA samples results in a patent or becomes commercially useful in 
any way, subjects will not be notified.
For subjects participating in the Psychotherapy Study the payment schedule is as follows:
1. The subject will be compensated $[ADDRESS_202517] will be compensated $[ADDRESS_202518] will be compensated $50 for their time in participation in the Part 1MRI session.

7.0 INTRODUCTION 
Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. (Taro) plans to submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) 
for a new formulation of desoximetasone: desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo. This product contains a potent 
corticosteroid to be indicated for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. 
7.1 Disease Being Treated 
Psoriasis is an immune (T-cell)-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 2% of 
the western population.[ADDRESS_1188618] commonly seen on the knees and/or elbows. Although there are reports 
implicating a genetic association with the disease, there are also studies that have established a set of 
psoriasis triggers including stress, medications (such as lithium, antimalarials, indomethacin, 
quinidine, beta blockers), injury or infection. The condition is considered chronic although the 
frequency and severity of outbreak in an individual can fluctuate without apparent cause.[ADDRESS_1188619] 50% of all psoriasis cases have scalp psoriasis. Although head represents only I 0% of the 
whole body surface, the visibility and symptoms of scalp psoriasis can be seriously debilitating for 
many patients, inducing social and emotional distress and negatively impacting quality of life.4 Scalp 
psoriasis is more difficult to treat compared to psoriasis of the body, because the skin of the scalp is 
less accessible to topi[INVESTIGATOR_853828]. Moreover, vehicles 
used in psoriasis medications are often not cosmetically acceptable for scalp treatment, thereby 
[CONTACT_853845]. There is a need for effective, safe and cosmetically 
acceptable products for the treatment of scalp psoriasis to improve both compliance and response to 
treatment. 5 
7.2 Availability and Efficacy of Already Approved Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_706870], previous treatment regimens 
and personal preference of the patient. Scalp psoriasis treatments historically include topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739], 
sprays, lotions, foams, and the more recently introduced shampoos. Examples of marketed products 
include corticosteroids (Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]®, Clobex™), Vitamin A and D derivatives (Tazorac®, Dovonex®), 
NSAIDs (salicylic acid), etc. For more severe cases, systemic therapy (methotrexate, oral retinoids, 
UV light, biologics, etc) may be warranted; however, the side effect profile of these products limits 
their use.1•2•5-7 
Desoximetasone is a high potency synthetic corticosteroid marketed in a number of formulations: gel 
(0.05%), cream (0.05% and 0.25%), and ointment (0.05% and 0.25%). All these formulations are 
encompassed under the Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® brand, acquired by [CONTACT_706893] U.S.A., Inc. (Taro) in 
2004. Most recently, Taro received approval on April 11, 2013 for a new dosage form (spray) under 
NDA #204141, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® (desoximetasone) Spray, 0.25%, a super high potency formulation that is 
indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years of age or older.8 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_853829], with less than 2% of patients reporting adverse reactions (7% in the pediatric 
population). The most commonly rep011ed adverse events are burning, stinging, pruritus, and skin

with Desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo(Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.) in Patients with Scalp Psoriasis 
Shampoos are considered a preferred treatment option for scalp psonas1s because of ease of 
application and cosmetic acceptability. There are many OTC coal tar shampoos in the market for 
treating mild scalp psoriasis. For the moderate-severe cases, a prescription shampoo containing potent 
corticosteroids is available in the market (Ciobex"' shampoo, clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], 0.05%). 
A new formulation of desoximetasone ( desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo) has been developed by [CONTACT_641736] U.S.A., Inc. (Taro), and is the Test product used in this study 
7.[ADDRESS_1188620] been known to cause suppression of 
the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis. In order to assess HPA axis function plasma levels of 
cortisol are measured before (basal) and after a bolus administration of synthetic a 1-24-
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In this study Cortrosyn ™ ( cosyntropin, a synthetic subunit of 
ACTH) (Amphstar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) will be used according to manufacturer instructions to 
assess HPA axis function (See Appendices D, E).[ADDRESS_1188621], desoximetasone 0.25% spray. Of 21 evaluable 
subjects, adrenal suppression was identified in 1 of 12 subjects having involvement of 10-15% of

9.6.16 Patient Wristband 
Each patient who enters the study will be provided with a wristband at Visit I to identify that the 
patient is taking a medication that could potentially cause HP A axis suppression. The patient 
should be instructed to wear the wristband for the duration of the study.

all three criteria listed below under Normal. Failure to meet any of these criteria is indicative of 
abnormal adrenal function or potential HP A axis suppression, even in absence of related 
symptoms (e.g. nausea, headache, myalgia, fatigue or loose stool); for abnormal results, the 
patient will be monitored in accordance to the follow-up schedule below.

Any patient presenting with symptoms of HPA ax1s suppression, such as nausea, headache, 
myalgia, fatigue or loose stool, will be referred to an endocrinologist. As an additional safety 
precaution, wristbands identifying the patient as someone suffering from adrenal suppression 
secondary to steroid withdrawal will be provided to alert medical personnel should any 
emergencies arise before adrenal function returns to normal. 
If the results of the cortisol response test still show signs of HPA axis suppression 28 days after 
discontinuing therapy the patient will be asked to return in 28 days (56 days after discontinuing 
steroid therapy) for another follow-up test. If the patient is still showing signs of HPA axis 
suppression [ADDRESS_1188644]. 
If HPA axis suppression persists for 56 days after discontinuing steroid therapy, but the patient 
has no symptoms they will be asked to return in 28 days (84 days after discontinuing steroid 
therapy) for another follow-up test. If HPA axis suppression persists for [ADDRESS_1188645].

9. 7 Adverse Events 
The patients will be monitored throughout the study for any Adverse Events. AEs will be collected 
through both solicited and unsolicited means and subsequently coded in tabular form using the 
MedDRA (Version 19 or higher) Adverse Event Dictionary. The patients will be encouraged to report 
signs, symptoms, and any changes in health to the clinic staff. Severity of each AE will be determined 
by [CONTACT_641747]. The Investigator will judge the 
relationship of the event to the study treatments. Adverse events should be followed up until they have 
resolved or stabilized. 
9.7.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse Ev nl: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
71515011 Rev. 2 • December 20,2016 • Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc • Page 29 of49 
CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL 
An Open Label, Safety Study to Assess the Potential for Adrenal Suppression Following Maximal Use Treatment 
with Desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo(Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.) in Patients with Scalp Psoriasis 
disease, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to this product. This includes events not seen at baseline, or worsened even if present 
at basel in e. 
Une/Rected Adverse Event: An adverse event where the nature or severity of is not consistent 
with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved 
product). 
Adverse Drug Reaction: All noxious and unintended responses to a medical product related to 
any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The response to a 'medical product' means 
that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a 
reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
9.7.2 Severity of Adverse Event 
The severity of the adverse event will be graded by [CONTACT_192326]: 
• MILD: Awareness of symptom but does not interfere with routine activities. 
• MODERATE: Discomfort sufficient to interfere with routine activities. 
• SEVERE: Impossible to perform routine activities. 
9.7.[ADDRESS_1188649] 
• NOT RELATED: Any AE that is clearly not related to use of the study drug. 
• POSSIBLE: The association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; however, a 
relationship between the drug and event cannot be ruled out. 
• PROBABLE: There is reasonable temporal relationship between the use of the study drug 
and the AE. Based upon the Investigator's clinical experience, the association ofthe event 
with the study drug seems likely. 
• DEFINITE : The AE occurs following the application of the study drug and it cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_853849]'s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of treatment administered to the patient. It 
disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study medication and reappears on a 
re-challenge ofthe study drug. 
9.7.4 Patient's Participation Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706881], if the patient suffers an AE that warrants discontinuation of the 
study drug because of interference with age-appropriate instrumental ADL (Activities of Daily 
Living), for example preparing for meal, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706880], using the telephone , 
etc. the patient will be followed until the AE resolves or is considered stable. Any subject that 
discontinues the study because of an adverse event will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.

9.8 Serious Adverse Events 
9.8.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose suggests a 
medically significant hazard, including any event that: 
• Results in death: includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to 
study treatment (e.g., car accident where patient is a passenger). 
• Is life-threatening: in the view of the Investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death at 
the time of the event. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (substantial disruption of one's 
ability to conduct normal life). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Causes congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above (e.g., intensive treatment in 
an emergency room, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). Emergency Room 
visits that require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed above are considered a Serious Adverse Event.

10.0 STATISTICAL METHODS 
10.1 Statistical Plan 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), detailing the intended statistical analysis of the study data, will be 
prepared as a separate document and finalized before database lock. Any deviation from the original 
statistical plan will be described and justified in the final report, as appropriate. The procedure for 
accounting for missing, unused and spurious data will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
All statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS®, Version 9.[ADDRESS_1188652] 
demonstrated possible HPA axis suppression following treatment with the study medication. As 
a secondary analysis of the data a logistic regression of the proportion of patients in the study 
with HPA axis suppression will be performed with% scalp affected as a covariate. See Appendix 
D for results from the cortisol response test considered indicative of potential HPA axis 
suppression. 
For all patients the actual amount of desoximetasone (mg) applied during the study will be 
calculated from recorded bottle weights and presented.

3. 30 minutes after the IM injection a second 5 ml blood sample should be obtained. The resulting 
two serum samples (at least 1 ml of serum in each) should be processed and labeled according to 
the instructions provided and sent the same day to ACM Global Laboratory for analysis of basal 
and post stimulated serum cortisol concentration. 
The resulting blood samples should be sent to ACM Global Laboratory for immediate testing. 
The test at the End of Study visit should not be performed if the patient dosed within [ADDRESS_1188669] normal basal cortisol level and adrenal function if they meet all 
three criteria listed below under Normal. Failure to meet any of these criteria is indicative of 
abnormal adrenal function or potential HP A axis suppression.

treatment. Patients will then be injected wilh 
Cortosyn.rM, a synthetic subunit of A TH. 
Systemic administration of a synthetic

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection exhibits the full corticosteroidogenic activity of natural ACTH. Various studies have shown that the biologic activity of 
ACTH resides in the N-terminal portion of the molecule and that the 1 -20 amino acid residue is the minimal sequence retaining full activity. Partial or complete 
loss of activity is noted with progressive shortening of the chain beyond 20 amino acid residues. For example, the decrement from 20 to 19 results in a 70% loss of 
potency. 
The pharmacologic profile or CORTROSYN TM is similar to that of purified natural ACTH. It has been established that 0.[ADDRESS_1188682]. These are considered to be without physiological or clinical significance . 
Animal, human and synthetic ACTH (1-39) which all contain [ADDRESS_1188683] very little immunologic although full biologic activity. This property 
or CORTROSYN TM assumes added importance in view of the known antigenicity of natural ACTH 
INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE 
CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortical insufficiency . 
Because of its rapid effect on the adrenal cortex it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test or adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or 
outpatient procedure, using only 2 venipunctures (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). 
Severe hypofunction of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] • adrenal axis is usually associated with subnormal plasma cortisol values but a low basal level is not per se evidence of 
adrenal insufficiency and does not suffice to make the diagnosis . Many patients with proven insufficiency will have normal basal levels and will develop signs of 
insufficiency only when stressed. For this reason a criterion which should be used in establishing the diagnosis is the failure to respond to adequate corticotropin 
stimulation. When presumptive adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a subnormal CORTROSYN TM test, Further studies are indicated to determine if it is primary 
or secondary , 
Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is the result of an intrinsic disease process, such as tuberculosis within the gland The production or 
adrenocortical hormones is deficient despi[INVESTIGATOR_714901] (feedback mechanism) Secondary or relative insufficiency arises as the result of defective 
production or ACTH leading in turn to disuse atrophy of the adrenal cortex It is commonly seen, for example, as result or corticosteroid therapy, Sheehan's 
syndrome and pi[INVESTIGATOR_121525]. 
The differentiation of both types is based on the premise that a primarily defective gland cannot be stimulated by [CONTACT_121635] a secondarily defective gland is 
potentially functional and will respond to adequate stimulation with ACTH Patients selected for further study as the result of a subnormal CORTROSYN TM test 
should be given a 3 or 4 day course of treatment with Repository Corticotropin Injection USP and then retested. Suggested doses are 40 USP units twice daily for 
4 days or 60 USP units twice daily for 3 days Under these conditions little or no increase in plasma cortisol levels will be seen in Addison's disease whereas 
higher or even normal levels will be seen in cases with secondary adrenal insufficiency

CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL 
An Open Label, Safety Study to Assess the Potential for Adrenal Suppression Following Maximal Use Treatment 
with Desoximetasone 0.25% shampoo(Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.) in Patients with Scalp Psoriasis 
The only contraindication to CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection is a history of a previous adverse reaction to it. 
PRECAUTIONS 
General 
CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection exhibits slight immunologic activity, does not contain animal protein and is therefore less risky to use than natural 
ACTH. Patients known to be sensitized to natural ACTH with markedly positive skin tests will, with few exceptions, react negatively when tested intradermally with 
CORTROSYN TM Most patients with a history of a previous hypersensitivity reaction to natural ACTH or a pre-existing allergic disease will tolerate 
CORTROSYN TM. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_121526], CORTROSYN TM is not completely devoid of immunologic activity and hypersensitivity reactions including rare 
anaphylaxis are possible. Therefore, the physician should be prepared, prior to injection, to treat any possible acute hypersensitivity reaction. 
Drug Interactions 
Corticotropin may accentuate the electrolyte loss associated with diuretic therapy. 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility. A study in rats noted inhibition of 
reproductive function like natural ACTH. 
Pregnancy 
Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection. It is also not known whether 
CORTROSYN TM can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. CORTROSYN TM should be given to a 
pregnant woman only if clearly needed. 
Nursing Mothers 
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when 
CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection is administered to a nursing woman. 
Pediatric Use 
(See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section) 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Since CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection is intended for diagnostic and not therapeutic use, adverse reactions other than a rare hypersensitivity 
reaction are not anticipated . A rare hypersensitivity reaction usually associated with a pre-existing allergic disease and/or a previous reaction to natural ACTH is 
possible, Symptoms may include slight whealing with splotchy erythema at the injection site. There have been rare reports of anaphylactic reaction. The following 
adverse reactions have been reported in patients after the administration of CORTROSYN TM and the association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: 
• bradycardia 
• tachycardia 
• hypertension 
• peripheral edema 
• rash 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
CORTROSYN TM (cosyntropin) for Injection may be administered intramuscularly or as a direct intravenous injection when used as a rapid screening test of 
adrenal function It may also be given as an intravenous infusion over a [ADDRESS_1188684] of adrenal function has been described by [CONTACT_853856] (1). A control blood sample of 6 to 7 mL is 
collected in a heparinized tube. Reconstitute 0 25 mg of CORTROSYN TM with 1 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP and inject intramuscularly . The 
reconstituted drug product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to injection Reconstituted CORTROSYN TM should not be 
retained. In the pediatric population, aged 2 years or less, a dose of 0 125 mg will often suffice A second blood sample is collected exactly 30 minutes later Both 
blood samples should be refrigerated until sent to the laboratory for determination of the plasma cortisol response by [CONTACT_853857] 12 hours, then the plasma should be separated and refrigerated or frozen according to 
need.

Two alternative methods of administration are intravenous injection and infusion. CORTROSYN TM can be injected intravenously in 2\o 5 ml of saline over a 2-
minute period. When given as an intravenous infusion: CORTROSYNTM, 0.[ADDRESS_1188685] been established to denote a normal response: 
1. The control plasma cortisol level should exceed 5 micrograms/1 00 ml 
2. The 30-minu\e level should show an increment of at least 7 micrograms/1 00 ml above the basal level. 
3. The 3D-minute level should exceed 18 micrograms/[ADDRESS_1188686] been reported by [CONTACT_121638]-workers (2). 
Plasma cortisol levels usually peak about [ADDRESS_1188687] CORTROSYN TM increment exhibit diurnal changes. However, the 3D-minute plasma cortisol level 
remains unchanged throughout the day so that only this single criterion should be used {3). 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration whenever solution and container permit. Reconstituted 
CORTROSYN TM should not be retained

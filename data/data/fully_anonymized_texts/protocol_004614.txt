Study Syn opsis 
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in American men. Most of the deaths related to 
PC are from metastatic disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_773570], progression 
eventually occurs and metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains an 
incurable disease. Novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773571], decrease pain,  and 
improve survival in mCRPC. Sipuleucel T has demonstrated an overall survival (OS) benefit in 
mCRPC, but given the modest magnitude of benefit and rare anti -tumor responses, better 
immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_192583]  [1]. In this protocol, we will comb ine the  novel immune 
therapy of antibody activated T cells with  anti-PD-1 (programed death rec eptor 1)  therapy  of 
pembrolizumab  to achiev e durable anti -tumor responses in mCRPC patients.  
 
Arming anti -CD3 activated T cells (ATC) with anti -CD3 x anti -HER2  bispecific antibody ( HER2 Bi) 
transforms every T cell into a specific cytotoxic T cell directed against prostate cancer. HER2  is 
overexpressed in about  42-70% of mCRPC cases, and HER 2 expression has progn ostic 
significance [1]. Preclinical data revealed that bispecific antibody armed T cells (BATs) kill even 
tumors that express low levels of HER2 ; responses and tumor cell kill were noted in a clinical trial 
in triple negative breast cancer [2].  A phase I study using HER2 Bi armed ATC ( HER2  BATs) in 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) induced immune responses and encouraging survival results with 
a me dian OS of 27 months in the HER 2 negative group  [3].  Immune responses in a phase I 
clinical trial in mCRPC patients suggest that infusions  of HER2  BATs "vaccinate" the p atients 
against their own PC by [CONTACT_773605] -tumor responses  [4].  Seven pretreated p atients with 
mCRPC were enrolled. There were no dose limiting toxicities, and three of seven  patients 
demonstrated significant decreases in their prostate -specific antigen ( PSA) levels and relief of 
bone pain. Immune evaluations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in two patients before and 
after immunotherapy showed increases in interferon -gamma (IFN-γ) ELISpot responses and Th [ADDRESS_1062338] immunosuppres sive characteristics with overexpression 
of CTLA -4, and i ncreased PD -1 expression , that  has been reported in the tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes in prostate cancer metastases  [5]. Agents such as CTLA -4, PD -1 and PD -L1 
inhibitors are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_773572]; h owever, a phase 
III trial of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a CTLA -[ADDRESS_1062339] of targeted therapy  [6]. We propose adding a monoclonal antibody 
inhibitor of PD -1 (pembrolizumab ) to BATs therapy in an attempt to o vercome 
immunosuppress ion and enhance anti -cancer effect.  
 
We will conduct a phase II study in mCRPC patients, to estimate the clinical efficacy of 8 infusions 
of HER2  BATs (up to 1010/infusion) twice per week for [ADDRESS_1062340] BATs infusion by 
[CONTACT_773606] p atients  free of clinical progression at 6 months after registration.

2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer:   Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer in 
American men, and the majority  of deaths related to PC are from metastatic disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_773573], metastatic PC remains an incurable malignancy. Androgen deprivation therapy  
that suppresses testosterone is effective for a limited period of time, and with the development of 
the castrate resistant state, the  addition of chemotherapy, androgen  receptor targeted agents , 
and immunotherapy have proven overall survival benefit. Desp ite these advances, metastatic 
castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains incurable, and novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773574] a 
cure continue to be a priority. The modest but statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit 
seen with sipuleucel -T prov ides proof of principle of the potential of immunotherapy in prostate 
cancer  [7].  
 
2.2 HER2  in Prostate C ancer:  HER2  expression in 42% -70% of prostate cancers is associated 
with shorter prostate cancer specific survival and higher relapse rates in those with higher 
expression of HER2  compared to those who are HER2  negative  [1,8].  Serum levels of HER2  were 
significantly higher in PC patients  than controls without cancer and the levels were significantly 
higher in patients  with metastatic disease  [9]. Furthermore, in localized disease, higher levels 
correlated with shorter times to recurrence  [9]. HER2  expression in PC cells increases with 
progression to androgen independence  [10,11].  Forced HER2  over-expression in a LAPC -4 PC 
model confers androgen -independent growth to androgen -dependent PC cells  [12]. This reveals 
the role and significance of HER2  expression in the progression and survival of CRPC . 
Unfortunately, a unique opportunity to evaluat e the effects of trastuzumab, an anti -HER2  
monoclonal antibody (mAb), in PC patients  resulted in early closing of the trial due to poor accrual 
of HER2 + (≥ 2+) PC patients  [13]. Another phase II clinical trial failed to demonstrate any benefit 
for trastuzu mab in CRPC patients  suggesting that antibody therapy alone is not potent enough to 
impact PC progression  [14]. In a phase II advanced prostate and renal cancer trial using the 
bispecific antibody (BiAb) MDX -H210 (15 g/m2) IV and granulocyte macrophage co lony-
stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) 5 g/kg/day subcutaneously for 4 days repeated weekly for 6 weeks, 
7 of 20 (35%) patients with prostate cancer had PSA responses (>50% decline in PSA ) [15]. Our

mediated by [CONTACT_93247] T cells via indep endent mechanisms of killing. HER2  BATs induce an 
immune response even in instances of low receptor HER2  receptor expression (e.g. targeting and 
cytotoxicity of breast ca ncer cell lines that are HER2  negative) or if receptors are present but 
inactivated, conditions that would otherwise impact negatively on treatment outcome with mAb 
therapy alone.  
 
2.3 HER2  Bispecific Antibody Armed T Cells ( BATs ): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) collected with pheresis  are activated ex -vivo with OKT3 to generate activated T cells 
(ATC). These ATC are subsequently “armed”  with 
BiAb that targets CD3 and HER2 . Arming ATC with 
HER2  BiAb ( HER2  BATs) makes every T cell into a 
non-MHC restricted HER2 -specific cytotoxic T 
lymphocyte (CTL ) [16]. BATs showed repeated 
killing, proliferation, and release of several cytokines 
that induce DC maturation. Dying tumor cells release 
tumor associated antigen s (TAA) that can lead to 
increased cross -presentation and epi[INVESTIGATOR_773575]. This mechanism, 
illustrated in Fig [ADDRESS_1062343], and ovarian 
cancer cell lines, secreted cytokines, and inhibited 
tumor growth in mice  [17,18,19 ,20].   
 
2.4 Programmed Cell Death Receptor 1 (PD -1): Immune checkpoint pathways restrict T cell 
activation and limit immune activation to minimize normal tissue damage. PD -L1 is a receptor 
expressed by T cells upon activation. PD -1 signaling is activated in T cells in response to PD -L1 
or L2 engagement and limits effector T -cell activity in peripheral tissues to limit normal tissue 
damage.  This PD -1/PD -L1/[ADDRESS_1062344] is hijacked by [CONTACT_773608] -tumor immune response 
and immune surveillance  [21]. In prostate cancer bone metastases PD -[ADDRESS_1062345] 
shown efficacy in a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, early phase trials in prostate cancer failed 
to show clinical benefit using anti -PD-1 treatment alo ne; however, anti -PD-1 does increase the 
efficacy of active immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_773576] T cells  [5]. Combining PD -[ADDRESS_1062346] therapy.  
 
2.5 HER2  BATs  Target High HER2  SK-BR-3 and Low HER2  SUM 1315 Expression Cell 
Lines: Preclinical studies showed that HER2  BATs were able to lyse breast cancer cells lines 
that expressed not only high amounts of HER2  (SK-BR-3, high 3+ expression) but, more 
importantly, target and lyse cell lines that express little (MCF -7, a negative control for 
immunohistoche mistry) or essentially no HER2  expression (Sum, 1315)  [22]. While this is not a 
major concern based on cell line expression, it is reassuring to know that only a few molecules of 
the target antigen  on the tumor surface are sufficient to allow binding and triggering of specific 
cytotoxicity ( Fig 2 ). This is consistent with the observation that as few as 10 -30 TCR -ligand 
interactions are sufficient to mediate T cell killing  [23].

(MBC):  A phase I trial in 23 women with 
HER2  0-3+ pretreated MBC consisted of 8 
infusions o f HER2  BATs in combination 
with IL -2 and GM -CSF to evaluate safety, 
feasibility, PFS, OS, T cell trafficking and 
immune responses. The median OS for 8 
HER2  3+ patients , 14 HER2  0-2+ patients , 
and all patients  were 57.4, 27.4, and 36.2 
months, respectively ( Fig 3 ). Targeting 
HER2  positive and negative tumors 
induced cytotoxic anti -tumor responses, 
increases in Th [ADDRESS_1062348] that BATs infusions 
may provide a clinical benefit  [24,25].  The HER2  BATS 
infused into MBC patie nts in the phase I trial were safe 
and induced immune and clinical responses. BATs 
infusions induced endogenous immune cells to 
develop anti -breast cancer CTL. This study provides 
PROOF of CONCEPT that BATs can vaccinate and 
provide adoptive transfer of im mune cells.   
 
2.7 Preclinical Studies that Support Proposed Research:  
 
2.7.1 HER2  expression on prostate cancer c ells.  The prostate cancer cell lines PC -3, 
DU-145, and LNCaP express easily detectable 
levels of HER2  (Fig 4).  SK-BR-3, a breast 
cancer cell line 
that exhibits 
high levels of 
expression of 
HER2  is shown 
as a positive 
control and an 
isotype control 
(goat anti -mouse, GaM) was used as the negative control.  
 
2.7.2 HER2  BATs prevent prostate cancer development 
in Winn Assay and induce remission in SCID mice.  SCID -
beige mice were injected subcutaneously in the right rear 
flank with 106 PC-3 tumor cells mixed with IL -2 alone (300 IU), 107 unarmed ATC and IL -2, 
and 1 -2 × 107 HER2  BATs and IL -2 (n = 8 mice per group). Fig 5 shows the time to tumor 
formation in each group. None of the mice in the HER2  BATs treated group developed tumors

experiment, SCID -beige mice with established PC -3 tumors were treated with IL -2, or HER2  
BATs (1 or 5x107 cells) and IL -2 twice a week until remission or euthanization due to 
excessive tumor burden. 8 of 8 mice treated with IL -2 alone were euthanized after 6 weeks. 
1 of 8 mice treated with 1x107 HER2  BATs and 2 of 8 mice treated with 5x107 HER2  BATs 
went into remission lasting 96 and 136 days, respectively  [18]. 
 
2.7.3 BATs k ill PC -3, DU -145, and LNCaP PC cell l ines. In 51Cr release cytotoxicity assays, 
arming of ATC with HER2 Bi significantly enhanced lysis of PC -3, DU -145 and LNCaP targets 
(Fig 6 ). ATC were expanded from PBMC from normal subjects or cancer patients by [CONTACT_14181] -
CD3 activation and expansion in low dose IL -2 as d escribed  [22]. After 14 days, ATC were 
harvested, counted, and armed with HER2 Bi or irrelevant (OKT3 x CD20). Fig 7 shows the 
cytotoxicity directed at PC -3 line mediated by [CONTACT_773610] 6 cancer patients and 10 normal 
donors armed with 5, 50 and 500 ng of HER2 Bi /106 ATC or 50 ng of CD20Bi at E/T intervals 
of 5-6.25, 10 -12.5, and 20 -25. The mean and medians for specific cytotoxicity directed at PC -
3 by [CONTACT_94970]2  BATs for each group are represented in box plots at the E:T intervals indicated. 
Unarmed ATC -mediated spe cific lysis was significantly lower than BATs in the normal donor 
(p=0.017) and patient ( p=0.04) groups.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.7.4 BATs secrete cytokines and chemokines when e ngaging targets cells. Fig 8  
shows the specific cytotoxicity directed at PC -3, DU -145, and LNCaP by [CONTACT_94970]2 Bi BATs from 
3 normal donors (N1, N2, and N3). Cytokines and chemokines are released from the BATs 
when the BATs are exposed to PC -3 tumor cells (Fig 9).  There was an increase in T h1 
cytokines GM -CSF, tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ), and IFNγ by 7 -, 54-, and 58 -fold, 
respectively, but not the Th 2 cytokine IL -4 when compared to unarmed ATC or ATC armed 
with an irrelevant (Irrel) BiAb (anti -CD3 x anti -CD20)  [2].

PC: A phase I dose escalation safety trial was conducted with BATs in patients with mCRPC  [4]. 
The patients received 2.5, 5 or 10 x 109 BATs per infusion in combination with low dose interleukin 
2 (IL -2) and GM -CSF. All 7 men had bone metastases and 2 had lung and liver involvement. 
Three patients had progressed after chemotherapy. Expansion was done using a single pheresis . 
The total dos es achieved ranged from 20 -80 billion.  There were no dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) 
at the doses tested. The only clinically 
relevant toxicity noted was grade 3 rigors 
requiring meperidine.  Overall survival 
ranged from 68 to 598 days (median 170 
days). Three patients experienced a 
decrease in bone pain  with a concomitant reduction in their pain medications. All infusions were 
done in the outpatient clinic. One patient who received 40 x 109 BATs had a partial response with 
his PSA decreasing from 32 to 12  that persisted for about 4 months ( Fig 10 ). Two other patients 
had transient decreases in their bone pain and PSA levels. Immune evaluations of fresh 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 3 responding patients before and after immunothera py 
showed increas es in IFN -γ ELI Spot responses ( Fig 11 ) and Th 1 serum cytokines. The pheresis  
products contained a median of 15.1x109 (9.4-25) PBMC prior to 11 -16 days of culture which 
yielded a median of 40 x 109 (32-139) ATC after culture.  There was a median viability o f 95% 
(90-97%), a median %CD3 of 89  (31-99), a median %CD4 of 51  (19-75), and a median % CD8 
of 34  (2-62) after culture .  
 
Polarized Th 1/Th 2 and increased levels of IL -12. Serum samples were obtained prior to each 
infusion and tested for IL -2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL -12 p70, IL -13, GM -CSF, IFNγ, and TNF -α using 
the Bio -Plex Protein Array System. The immune response in 2 CRPC patients remained polarized 
towards a Th 1 response throughout treatment ( Fig 12 ). The ratio of type1/type 2 was also highly 
polarized to  a type 1 response (data not shown).   Serum levels of IL -[ADDRESS_1062350] -4th infusion of BATs ( Fig 13 ).  Since  IL-12 is produced by [CONTACT_773611], 
these data provide evidence of “vaccination” of the endogenous immune system.   
 
In addition , a phase I trial 
in breast cancer has well 
established the clinical 
safety and preliminary 
efficacy of BATs. The 
predominant toxicities 
noted in this study were 
fever, chills and

and 43.1% at dose levels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The incidence of headaches was 3.1, 8.3, and 
19.6% at dose levels, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All patients with grade 3 chills responded to 
meperidine. One patient at dose level 3 experienced a grade 4 headache and hypertension and 
was removed from the study after 3 infusions (65.7 × 109 total aATC).  Evidence of clinical and 
immunologic responses in women with HER2  0/1+ status in the  Phase I trials suggests a 
therapeu tic benefit even in the absence of HER2  over-expression and provides encouraging 
results in HER2  low-negative patients treated with armed activated T cells  [16]. The median 
overall survival (OS) was 36.2 months for all 23 patients (22 evaluable and 1 non -evaluable = 23), 
57.4 months for the HER2  3+ patients, and 27.4 months for the HER2  0–2+ patients. BATs 
infusions induced endogenous cytotoxic T -cell and immunokine responses that persisted up to 4 
months  [16]. The findings showed that cellular immune respo nses develop and may augment 
immune based killing of tumors even in patients who were progressing. One explanation for the 
encouraging OS in HER2  0–2+ patients could be a polyclonal immune responses that may target 
residual chemotherapy resistant HER2  positive “cancer stem -like cells” (CSC) that exhibit self -
renewal properties and are responsible for cancer relapse. Prior studies also suggest that anti -
HER2  reagents may be effective against HER2  positive CSC in tumors that are primarily HER2  
negative  [16].  
 
2.9 Immune Check Point Inhibitors Enhance EGFR BATs Function : It has been  demonstrated 
that combining ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a CTLA -4 immune checkpoint inhibitor, with T cells armed with anti -
CD3 x anti -EGFR bispecific antibody (EGFR BATs) can enhance the anti -tumor activity of BATs.

killing by [CONTACT_773612][INVESTIGATOR_773578] E:T of 25:1 for COLO356/FG. Fig 14c  shows the same

2.10 Pembrolizumab : The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of 
neoplastic transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a 
correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis 
in various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to cor relate with improved prognosis and long -term 
survival in many solid tumors.  
 
The PD -[ADDRESS_1062352] hijacked by [CONTACT_13207].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD L2).  The structure of murine PD -1 has been 
resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig 
Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 
tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an 
immunoreceptor tyro sine-based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD [ADDRESS_1062353] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD -1 was shown to be expres sed on activated lymphocytes 
including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells.  Expression 
has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well 
as subsets of macrophages and dendrit ic cells.  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are 
constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic 
tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV- and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions 
with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_1062354] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only 
detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control im mune T -cell activation in lymphoid 
organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues.  
Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to 
express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -
specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive 
target  for therapeutic intervention.  
 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -
L1 and PD -L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizuma b) has recently been approved in the United State s for

following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_773583]-small  cell lung cancer. This agent has been 
evaluated in mul tiple malignancies and has established safety and efficacy profile.  
 
2.11 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification : An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 
001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab 
(MK-3475 ).  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 
and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All 
three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in 
human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor 
size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD was identified 
to date.  10.0 mg/k g Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, w as the dose and schedule utilized 
in multiple cohorts to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within 
the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less freque nt schedule 
may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK)  data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow 
systemic clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmaco dynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is 
durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamics (PD)  data provides scientific rationale 
for utilizing a Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population PK analysis of pembrolizumab was  performed using serum concentration time data 
from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters 
of pembrolizumab  were found to be dependent on body weight. The relationship between 
clearance and body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for 
other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across 
all body weights.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen r elative to a 2 
mg/kg Q3W body weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established 
exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins 
are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in me lanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the 
proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The population 
PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In 
addition, exposure was similar between th e NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there 
are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication settings.  
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in solid 
tumors is based on: 1) similar  efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 2 mg/kg 
or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response relationships of 
pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 
3) the lac k of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the assumption that the dynamics of 
pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed 
dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consis tent with those 
obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the 
exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) 
will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are 
well tolerated and safe.

A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and 
to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complex ity in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  Hence the dose used in this study 
is 200mg IV every 3 weeks .  
 
2.12 Summary of Clinical and Preclinical Data : Preclinical testing of HER2  BATs revealed 
efficacy in binding and killing PC -3, DU -145, and LNCaP cell lines [25,26].  PC-3 cells are low 
expressors of HER2 ; despi[INVESTIGATOR_773584].  Anti -CD3 cross -linking leads to T cell 
activation, prolif eration, and cytokine synthesis  [27-30]. T cells expanded in IL -2 after anti -CD3 
activation exhibited non -major histocompatibility restricted cytotoxicity, and produced tumoricidal 
cytokines  such as IFNγ, TNFα, and GM -CSF [31 -41]. HER2  BATs administered with PC -3 (Winn 
Assay) or injected intratumorally prevented development of, or induced remissions, respectively, 
in PC -3 tumors in severe comb ined immunodeficient beige mice [ 18]. Intravenously administered

should be considered under the retreatment criteria 
in section 5.7.  
 
The c linical  protocol will enroll mCRPC  patients who are progressing per Prostate Cancer working 
Group II (PCWGII) criteria, on treatment with androgen suppression therapy  [42]. Scientific, 
regulatory , and FDA approval will be obtained for the clinical trial protocol.  The study will be 
conducted at Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI)  under the direction of [CONTACT_773639] as the Principal 
Investigator . [CONTACT_764777] at University of Virginia ( UVA) will oversee the manufacturing and 
preparation of BATs  product which will be shipped to KCI for patient infusion.   
 
[CONTACT_764777]  at UVA  is the sponsor of the currently active IND #[ADDRESS_1062373] from KCI will be shipped by [CONTACT_773615] (see section 7. 0). Pheresis  procedure will be done in accord ance with institutional 
procedures using mononuclear cells (MNC) collection program. Up to a total of 5 circulating blood 
volumes (CBV) will be processed. Midpoint procedure (after [ADDRESS_1062374] been processed) cell 
count from the collection bag will be done  to estimate the final yield with the goal of at least [ADDRESS_1062375] selected a dose -range of 5 -10 billion HER2  BATs per infusion (a total dose of 40-80 
billion BATs) based on the 
immune and clinical responses 
and proven safety noted in our 
prior phase I trials.  BATs will be 
infused twice a week for 4 weeks 
for a total of 8 doses. Booster 
doses maybe administered after 
assessment of primary endpoint. 
This will be a decision based on 
extent and duration of patient 
response and patient willingness.  
PD-1 inhibitor therapy (MK -3475 
2 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks) will 
start atleast  1 week prior to BATs

assessment for any toxicity and safety concerns before the initiation of BATs. Disease evaluation  
with scans  will occur every 12 weeks  (+/- 1 week) after first pembrolizumab dose  for one year, 
unless progression occ urs. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients that are free of 
progression at 6 months. Additional clinical outcome parameters will include time to PSA, skeletal 
and radiologic progression, time to next systemic therapy intervention, and ove rall survival (OS) 
of the patients enrolled on the clinical trial.  The response to immune therapy is likely to be delayed 
and an immediate PSA decline or decrease in metastases cannot be expected. We have hence 
chosen a 6 month time point to evaluate patie nts as being progression free or not, to use as a 
go/no go signal for future development of BATs in mCRPC.  
 
4.2 Activation and Expansion of T cells with OKT3 and IL -2:  Pheresis will be performed at 
KCI, and the fresh pheresis product will be shipped to UVA for processing. Armed ATC are 
prepared in the Cancer Immunotherapy Laboratory at UVA under BB -IND #[ADDRESS_1062376]. Lum.  The lymphocytes will be activated with a nti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) which cross -links the 
CD3 receptors on T cells and activates T cells.  The ATC will be expanded in the presence of IL -
2 up to 14 days.  After culture, ATC will be harvested, washed, armed with OKT3 x Herceptin, 
and cryopreserved in 10% DMSO and 20% protein (albumin or autologous plasma) in liquid 
nitrogen at the doses for IV infusions.  No exogenous IL -2, OKT3, or other culture reagents (e.g. 
medium components) are present in the final cryopreserved product.  Evaluation of cryopreser ved 
versus freshly cultured ATC has shown no differences in viability, phenotype, or function (e.g. lytic 
activity, cytokine production, response to cytokines, and proliferation) in these cell preparations. 
The cytotoxicity mediated by [CONTACT_773616] c ryopreservation was equivalent to those armed 
after thawing of cryopreserved ATC.  
 
4.3 Treatment Regimen with BATs :  
 
4.3.1 HER2  BATs  infusions . The BATs  infusions will be performed by [CONTACT_773617]’s staff on the SOP for infusing the BATs .  An 
infusaport or any central line will be acceptable for infusing the BATs  IV. The Immunotherapy 
Program Coordinator will deliver and coordinate the timing and site for thawing the frozen 
product for IV infusions.  All appropriate assurances for identification of product, patient, 
sterility, etc. will be performed during the transfer to the infusion site prior to infusions.  
Frozen BATs  will be thawed and infused into the patient at the bedside per SOPs. The time 
for BATs  infusions will vary from patient to patient, but the dose of BATs  will be given over 
5-[ADDRESS_1062377] not experienced toxicities related 
to ATC infusions.  If there is a history of reactions to ATC or other blood products, then 
Benadryl 50 mg IV or P.O. will be given as a premedication 30 minutes prior to infusion of 
cryopreserved cells. Tylenol, 1000 mg, may be given 30 minutes prior to cell infusion to as 
pre-medications to prevent fever, chills, and pain if there is a history of infusion  side effects.  
Demerol 25 -50 mg IV may be used to treat c hills.  These medications may be repeated 
every 4 -6 hours as needed.  Patients will be prehydrated with 250 -500 ml of normal saline 
prior to BATs  IV infusions. Hydrocortisone (50 -100 mg IV) may be given to control severe 
reactions to infusions.

every [ADDRESS_1062378] dose of pembrolizumab.  Every effort should be made to target infusion timing to be as close 
to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps a window of -5 
minutes and +10 minutes is permitte d (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).   
 
 
5.0 POTENTIAL TOXICITY, DOSE MODIFICATION, AND MANAGEMENT  
 
5.1 Pheresis Procedure : Reported toxicity from pheresis is minimal. If patients have adequate 
IV access then a central catheter may not be necessary. This will be determined with a vein check 
performed by [CONTACT_3436]. Patients have a small potential for infection from the placement of 
central catheters . Use of the anti coagulant citrate dextrose may cause symptoms of mild 
hypocalcemia, which are controlled with calcium carbonate (TUMS).  
  
5.2 HER2 Bi Armed Activated T Cells : Toxicity associated with BATs  has been minimal. The 
reported symptoms have been reversible with cessation of therapy.  Most patients treated with 
BATs  experienced no side effects during infusions.  Fever and chills were the most common 
reported reaction.  Other rarely reported affects  included mild gastrointestinal and neurologic 
symptoms.  Toxicity associated with reinfusion of cryopreserved cells is generally attrib utable to 
the DMSO preservative.  These include fever, nausea and fatigue. No one has died due to a cell -
related toxici ty.  
5.3 Pembrolizumab  (MK-3475)  Dose Modification : There are no changes in dose for 
pembrolizumab. Treatment can be held for specific toxicities as per Table 3 below. Adverse 
events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent 
an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or several 
months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizuma b must  be withheld for drug -related 
toxicities and severe or life -threatening AEs as per Table 3 below. See Section  5.5 for supportive 
care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

Version Date: 7/26 /2017 , 8/31/2017 , 3/16/2018 , 07/24/18 , 02/19/2020,  04/24/2020, 09/09/2020  trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be 
required.  The investigator should discuss any questions rega rding this with the [COMPANY_006] Clinical 
team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator 
and/or the subject's primary physician.  
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_1062383]’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator 
in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will 
be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription,  over-the-counter 
(OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial 
period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on 
the CRF.  
 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1062384] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as 
defined in Section 11.5. 
 
5.4.2 Prohibited c oncomitant m edications . Subjects are prohibited from receiving the 
following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_595207] (including retreatment for 
post-complete response relapse) of this trial:  
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
 Radiation therapy  
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomati c solitary lesion or to the brain may

 Live vaccines within 30 days prior to registration  and while participating in the trial.  
Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles , 
mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic 
dose s of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the PI. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  
Subjects may receiv e other medications that the investigator deems to be medically 
necessary.  The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications which are prohibited in this 
trial. There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
 
5.5 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care : 
 
5.5.1 Supportive care g uidelines . Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care 
measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care 
measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are 
outlined below. Where appropriat e, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous 
treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do 
not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid 
tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. 
For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic 
 
22 
Version Date: 7/26 /2017 , 8/31/2017 , 3/16/2018 , 07/24/18 , 02/19/2020,  04/24/2020, 09/09/2020  disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The 
treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events 
to be related to pembrolizumab. Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to 
be related, the investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance  (as outlined 
below). Refer to Section 5. 3 for dose modification. It may be necessary to perform 
conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin photography as part of 
evaluation of the event.  
 
Pneumonitis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measure s, as needed.  
 Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration.  
 
Diarrhea/Colitis:  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
 All subjects who experience d iarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and end oscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
 For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer oral corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis, treat with intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_458531].   
 When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, stero id taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 
Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA) : 
 For T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
o Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and 
for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
o Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
Hypophysitis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 
or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is 
tapered.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4  weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism:  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Thyroid function (TSH, free/total

Version Date: 7/26 /2017 , 8/31/2017 , 3/16/2018 , 07/24/18 , 02/19/2020,  04/24/2020, 09/09/2020  T3 and free/total T4 will be checke d at baseline and check TSH at dose # 3, 6 and 9 of 
pembrolizumab. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, 
periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical 
signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  If symptoms are noted or if thyroid function is 
abnormal further evaluation and appropriate treatment is required.  
 Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism):  
o In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers  (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
o In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care.  
 Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
o Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid  followed by [CONTACT_78019]. 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
Hepatic:  
 For Grade 2 events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
o Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade  1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
Renal Failure or Nephritis:  
 For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
 For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
 When symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_1062385] 
been reported with pembrolizumab therapy. If any of these conditions occur please treat 
with corticosteroids and supportive care and discontinue therapy permanently.

9.1 Tumor Measurements : All tumor measurements will be measured in centimeters prior to 
initiation of therapy.  These measurements should be done according to RECIST 1.1 criteria  [45]. 
The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) criteria will also be used  to 
determi ne a response in non -measurable disease  [42]. PCWG2 recommends a two -objective 
paradigm in metastatic CRPC: (1) controlling, relieving, or eliminating disease manifestations that 
are present when treatment is initiated and (2) preventing or delaying diseas e manifestations 
expected to occur. PSA decline and changes in imaging will also be reported. An estimate of 
overall objective and subjective response will be made and r ecorded at the end of treatment, [ADDRESS_1062403] s may be repeated 3 months later  based on  immune -related response criteria 
(irRC) , and the designation of CR, PR, SD, or PD will be made at that time  [46].   
 
9.2 Response Definitions:  Response will be defined by [CONTACT_773630], or the RECIST 
1.1 criteria with the allowance of an initial mild PD due to the nature of immunologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_773593].  
 
9.2.1  Complete response (CR) . Disappearance of all clinical evidence of active tumor for 
a minimum of eight (8) weeks.  The patient must be free of all symptoms.  All measurable, 
evaluable and non -evaluable lesions and sites must be assessed.  
 
9.2.2  Partial response (PR) . At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the target lesions 
compared to the baseline sum.  No lesion may increase in size and no new lesions may 
appear.  
 
9.2.3  Progressive disease (PD) . For measurable disease, a n increase of 20% in the sum 
of the target lesions or unequivocal progression of non -target lesions.   
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_1062404] bone metastases which are not considered measurable sites of 
disease. Progression in patients wi th bone metastases will be defined as either the 
appearance of a minimum of 2 new lesions on bone scan which are related to metastatic 
disease per the judgement of the treating physician, or the occurrence of a new skeletal 
related event. Skeletal -related event is defined as occurrence of new pathologic bone 
fractures (vertebral or nonvertebral), spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], requirement of surgery or 
radiation therapy to bone metastases (including the use of radioisotopes), or a requirement 
to change antineopla stic therapy to treat bone pain or other related symptoms.  
 
9.2.5 Stable disease (SD) . Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient  
increase /change  to qualify for PD.  
 
9.2.6 Response evaluable patients . All patients registered on the protocol and completing 
a minimum of one dose of pembrolizumab and one dose of BATs therapy followed by 
[CONTACT_2085], and radiologic or PSA assessment of disease status.  
 
9.2.7 Toxicity  evaluable patients . All patients registered  on the protocol and starting  
therapy with protocol medication  will be considered toxicity evaluable.

registration to death or last follow up. After treatment is discontinu ed for any reason patients 
will be followed every 3 months for progression and survival.  
 
 
10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM STUDY  
 
10.1 Disease Progression:  Patients with progressive disease will be removed from study . 
 
10.2 Extraordinary Medical Circumstances:  If at any time the constraints of this protocol are 
detrimental to the patient’s health, the patient shall be withdrawn from treatment.  In this event:

physician directed.  
 
10.2.2 The patient will remain technically “on -study” although treatment has been dis contin-
ued.  The patients will be followed for PFS, OS, and immune responses.  
  
10.3 Unexpected or Life -Threatening Toxicity:  
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1062406] questions regarding drug therapy to the Principal Investigator.  
 
10.3.2  Reporting requirements and procedures depend upon: (1) whether agents are sus -
pected of causing toxicity, (2 ) whether possibility of such toxicity was reported in the consent 
form, or manufacturer’s literature (Published Toxicity), (3) the severity or grade of the 
toxicity.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected toxicities . Grade 4 myelosuppression: Report only as part of 
regular data submission.  All other toxicities, Grades 4 and 5: Written Report  to 
Principal and Co -Investigators, within 10 working days.  All other toxicities, Grades 
1 to 3: Report only as part of regular data submission.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected toxicities . Unexpected toxicities are toxicities that are not 
listed in the toxicity management section of the protocol, the consent form, or the 
manufacturer’s package insert.  All unexpected toxicities will be reported to Principal 
and Co -Investigators, within [ADDRESS_1062407]. Lum (the IND 
Sponsor at UVA).  
 
11.2 All reactions in a “reportable”  category must be reported unless it is documented in the

unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disea se temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified 
procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -
specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in 
frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with 
the use of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event.  
 
[COMPANY_006] product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, 
diagnostic agent or protocol -specified procedure, whether investigational (including

Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] pro duct in clinical 
trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or 
intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
 
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event.  
 
All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment 
allocation/randomization must be reported by [CONTACT_773631], or are the result of a protocol -specified intervention, 
including but not limited t o washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo 
treatment or a procedure.  
 
From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through [ADDRESS_1062411] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. Such 
even ts will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksheets.  The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious 
criteria is described in Section 11.5.4.  
 
The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subj ects with non -serious adverse 
events for outcome.  
 
11.5.2 Definition of an overdose for this protocol and reporting of overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] . For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will 
be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or  greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No 
specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. 
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. In the event 
of overdose, the subject should be observ ed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] 
product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adver se event, even if no other 
seriousness criteria are met.  
 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without 
any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is 
reported as a non -serious E vent of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology 
“accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 
hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours t o [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn:

term benefits of longer lasting endogenous anti -tumor activity  [3]. The studies show that 
IgG2a -depleted PBMC exhibited high levels of breast cancer specific cytotoxicity and IFN -
γ EliSpots after immuno therapy; evidence for the development of endogenous anti -tumor 
activity  [47]. Moreover, we predict that evidence of endogenous immune activity will 
correlate with improvements in clinical outcomes.

cytotoxicity directed PC cell lines, and antibodies directed at PC cell lines and selected 
cytokines in the serum at designated time points in the protocol. Specific cytotoxic 
responses  will be measured with IFN -γ ELI Spot and 51Cr release assays. Serum will be 
tested for the Th 1/Th 2 serum cytokine profiles and serum antibodies directed at PC cells 
using a cell based ELISA as described  [48,49]. Baseline serum and cell s will be aliquoted 
from the pheresis. Blood draws (4 green top tubes containing approximately 40 ml of anti -
coagulated blood and 1 red top tube containing 8 ml of serum) will be collected pre 
therapy, pre-BATs infusion, after the 4th infusion, approximately 1-2 weeks , 2 months  
(90 days ± 7 days), 4 months  (120 days ± 7 days), 6 mo nths (180 days ± 7 days) and 
optionally every 6 mo nths thereafter (180 days ± 7 days) after the last infusion .  Optional 
immune evaluations (IEs) will be done if there continues to be immune response at [ADDRESS_1062426] disappeared. Patient immune function data will 
be compared to their baseline to evaluate ch anges induced by [CONTACT_773632]. IFN -γ ELI Spots will 
be considered positive if they change ≥2 fo ld above a baseline with ≥30 ELI Spots/106 cells 
plated.  
 
12.2. Monitor Changes in Tumor Infiltrating T cells, PD -1 Expression, and Th 1/Th 2 Ratio: 
These will be considered exploratory biomarkers to assess the rationale for future combinations 
with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Tumor infiltrating cells (TILs) have  shown to be surrogates of 
improved outcome in metastatic solid tumor malignancies. In advanced breast cancer the 
induction of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes was noted to correlate closely with improved OS  [50]. 
The TILs were analyzed and quantified in 10%  increments in metastatic breast cancer trials. 
Tumor tissue biopsies will be obtained pre and post therapy and evaluated for TILs. In addition 
PD-1 expression on the TILs will be assessed by [CONTACT_9064] ( IHC).

T cells subp opulations, activation status of T cells, immune suppressive cells and immune 
inhibitory molecules (PD -1/PD -L1) in the tumor samples. The analysis of host –tumor 
interactions and immune reaction within the tumor may provide information. Fukunaga et 
al [51] showed that the presence of tumor infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes provide 
a good indicator of patient's outcome after surgical treatment. Another study analyzing 
599 early -stage (stage I and II) colorectal cancers showed that tumors with low cytoto xic 
(CD8) T cells had poor prognosis, while patients  with Th 1 polarized, highly cytotoxic T cells 
in the center and the invasive margin of the tumor experienced a very low level of 
recurrence  [52]. These studies suggest that the immune landscape of the tum or may 
provide useful prognostic information.  
 
12.2. [ADDRESS_1062429]. Lum’s laboratory.  In the 
past year, we developed immunohistochemical staining for cytoplasmic or extracellular 
IFN-γ and IL -10 as well as CD3 (Thakur, unpublished data) in paraffin sections ( Fig 17 ).  
Original  biopsies will be stained for CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD127+, cytoplasmic IFN -γ (Th 1 
representative cytokine) and IL -10 (Th 2 representative cytokine), T regs, M2-macrophages, 
MDSC, PD -1/ PD -L1 in the tumor sections. We will calculate the ratio of CD4/CD8, and 
the ratio of Th 1/Th [ADDRESS_1062430] CD3, CD4, CD8, IFN -γ, IL-10, PD -1, and PD -L1. Staining will be carried 
out on paraffin embedded resected tumor tissue sections by [CONTACT_773633] 1 using anti -
CD3/anti -IFN-γ anti -CD8/Granzyme B and for IL -10 expression, slide will be stained for

13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
13.1 Clinical Trial : This is a phase II study in mCRPC patients with a single arm two -stage design.  
The primary objective is to study the clinical efficacy.  The primary endpoint is the proportion of 
patients achieving clinical progression -free interval of 6 months from study registration.  The 
clinical progression is defined by [CONTACT_773636], 
monthly PSA monitoring and radiologic assessment at 3 and 6 months, and every 6 -month 
interval thereafter.  
 
Sample Size/ Power calculation : The study will use Simon’s two -stage design to test the null 
hypothesis of 20% or less versus the alternative hypothesis of more than 20% patients achieving 
progression free time of ≥ 6 months.  Our expected percentage is 40%. With 5% Type I error and 
80% power, the Simon’s two -stage minmax design requires a total of 33 patients and has a 
probability of early termination of 0.716 if the treatment is not promising. The PASS12 was used 
for sample size calculation  [53].  At the first stage, 18 evaluable pati ents will be enrolled.  The trial 
will be terminated if 4 or fewer patients are progression free at 6 months. If the trial goes on to the 
second stage, 15 more patients will be enrolled.  It the total number of progression free at 6 
months is 11 or higher,  the null hypothesis will be rejected.  The treatment will be considered 
promising with more than 20% clinical progression free at 6 months.  The secondary objective is 
to estimate the OS with KM method.  
 
The accrual rate at KCI is about 2 per month. The 18 patients in stage I will require 9 months to 
accrue and 6 months to follow up for primary endpoint.  If the trial proceeds to stage II, 8 months 
accrual for 15 additional patients and 6 months follow up will result in study duration of 29 months.  
 
13.2 Immune Function Testing : For those aforementioned quantitative immune response 
variables (Section 12.1), we will produce summary statistics (including means, medians, and 
standard deviations) pre - and post -BATs treatment. Subsequent analyses will compare the 
immune response variables (after a suitable transformation, if necessary) pre - and post -treatment 
using a paired t -test (or Wilcoxon sign ranked test if the data are not approximately normally 
distributed after log transformation). To explore whether i mmune responses associate with clinical 
responses, the association between the baseline of each biomarker and clinical endpoints (such 
as response, or OS) will be analyzed using logistic regression for binary endpoints and Cox 
regression for time to event endpoints. Analyses will adjust for other covariates such as age and 
tumor stage.   
 
Power calculation :  For this  correlative endpoint , we have at least 18 patients  (or 33 patients  if 
the trial proceeds to stage II). For one -sample Student t test a sample size of 18 pairs achieves 
80% power to detect a median to large effect of 0.[ADDRESS_1062432] with 
significance level of 0.05. All the raw p values will be reported together with False Discovery Rate 
(FDR) adjusted p values for multiple te sting  [54].   
 
13.3 IHC Testing : For the qualitative IHC measurements, we will produce summary statistics 
(including frequency table and percentage of positivity). The McNemar test will be used for testing 
protein positivity concordance pre- and post -BATs treatment. To explore whether protein positivity 
associate with clinical responses, the association between the baseline of each biomarker and 
clinical endpoints (such as response, or OS) will be analyzed using logistic regression for bi nary 
endpoints and Cox regression for time to event endpoints. Analyses will adjust for other covariates 
such as age and tumor stage.

Power calculation :  For this objective we  estimate that about 23 patients  (~70% have quality 
tissue materials for IHC) will have baseline IHC measurements. About [ADDRESS_1062433] - treatment IHC measurements. The sample size will decrease if the trial stops at 
stage I.  In that case, only descriptive an alysis will be provided for biomarkers.  For power 
calculation, the primary analysis is the Fisher’s exact test between the baseline marker status 
(positive vs. negative) and clinical response.  Assuming 40% response and 10% protein positives 
in non -respon der, a  sample size of 23 achieves 80% power to detect a large effect of 60% 
difference with a two sided test at significance level of 0.05. All the raw p values will be reported 
together with False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted p values for multiple testin g [54]. 
 
13.4 Statistical Monitoring Plan for Toxicity : Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) 
will examine the overall safety data monthly.  Frequency and severity of all toxicities will be 
tabulated and summarized for review by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_773599]. Interim safety analysis will be 
performed after first [ADDRESS_1062434] stage of the Simon’s two -stage design ( 18 
subjects) on patients who received at least one cycle of treatment.  
 
Interim safety analyses will be focused on two criteria s eparately: definitely treatmen t-related 
(pembrolizumab or BATs ) deaths; and grade 4 treatment -related AEs that persisted ≥72 hours 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_773600].  Two-sided 90% exact binomial confidence 
intervals (CIs) will be calculated.    
 
Definitely treatment -related deaths :  We assume that rare fatal events should not exceed 1%. 
If the lower CI (LCI) exceeds 1%, the study will be suspended. This corresponds to ≥ 1+ (1 or 
more) out of 5 and ≥ 2+ out of 18 subjects in the interim safety analys es.  
 
Definitely treatment -related grade 4 SAEs :  We assume that rate should not exceed 10%. If 
the LCI exceeds 10%, the accrual will be suspended. This corresponds to ≥ 3+ (3 or more) out of 
5 and ≥ 5+ out of 18 subjects in the interim safety analyses.  
 
If the LCI exceeds the pre -defined levels, study accrual will be halted and the study DSMC will 
meet to assess the safety of the drug regimen. The committee could decide to reconsider the 
treatment and/or modify the protocol before proceeding or to stop th e study permanently.  
 
14.0  CLINICAL  DATA  SAFETY MONITORING  
  
14.1 Recruitment : To address concerns related to decreased minority recruitment in local and 
national protocols , we will take specific steps to enhance the awareness in the Detroit Metro 
region and the State of Michigan to recruit minority groups for this study. The location of KCI 
provides a unique opportunity to recruit African Americans to the protocol. Our previous accrual 
records also indicate that we have been successful in recruitment to t his patient population  with 
a track record of about 40% African American patients enrolled on prostate cancer protocols .  
 
14.2 Informed Consent : Patients will be enrolled after signed written informed consent is 
obtained following a detailed review of the study design, schedule and side effects and discussion 
of all therapeutic alternatives , with the investigator/s in a consultation visit of approximately 1 hour 
with a follow up and reinforcement of the risks and benefits with the research nurse coordinator. 
The consent forms are signed in the presence of one of the investigators and/or the Nurse 
Coordinator. The patients are given  the consent forms after the consult and asked to write down 
any questions after reading the consent forms  and to bring the questions to the signing meeting.

adherence to  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_773602]. Adherence to the protocol, i.e., protocol violations, 
data completeness and integrity will also be reviewed. Overall assessment of accrual, toxicities 
and responses will be done at this time to determine whether significa nt benefits or risks are 
occurring that would warrant study closure. A monthly summary will be provided to the Karmanos 
Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee and will be reviewed quarterly. One 
month prior to anniversary date of the IRB ori ginal approval, a yearly summary report of trial 
activities will be made to all participating co -investigators and the Karmanos Cancer Institute 
Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee. This report will include the number of patients, the 
number of patien ts treated, a summary of all adverse events reported to date, a specific list of 
serious adverse events requiring immediate reporting and any significant developments that may 
affect the safety of the participants or ethics of the study.  
 
14.3.1 Meetings: Scheduled meetings will be held as necessary and at least monthly , on 
the activity of the protocol. These meetings will include the protocol investigators, data 
managers, and key personnel involved with the conduct of the protocol.  
 
 14.3.2 Evaluations: During these meetings the investigators will discuss matters related 
to: 
 Safety of protocol participants (Adverse Event reporting)  
 Validity and integrity of the data  
 Enrollment rate relative to expectation of target accrual, characteristics of the 
particip ants 
 Retention of participants, adherence to the protocol (potential or real protocol 
violations)  
 Data completeness on case report forms and complete source documentation  
 
14.3.3 Completed data and safety m onitoring  reports : Reports of these regular 
investigator meetings will be kept on file in the office of the Clinical Trials Core. The data 
manager assigned to the clinical trial will be responsible for completing the report form. 
The completed reports will be reviewed and signed off by [CONTACT_45822] (PI) or 
by [CONTACT_454121] -investigators  in the absence of the PI. The signed off forms will then be 
forwarded to the Quality Manager, Clinical Trials Office for review of completeness and 
processing with the Karmanos Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee.  
 
14.3.4 Data Safety Monitoring Committee: The Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer 
Institute, Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will meet on a monthly basis to review 
the Serious Adverse Event forms and Data and Safety study specific  reports that have 
been filed.  
 
14.3.5 Retention of records: All documentation of adverse events, records of study drug 
receipt and dispensation, and all IRB correspondence will be retained for a minimum of 2 
years after the investigation is completed.  
 
14.3.6 Protocol activation: This protocol will not be activated until the Karmanos Cancer 
Institute Protocol Review Committee, the Wayne State University IRB, and the US Food 
and Drug Administration have approved the initiation of this protocol.

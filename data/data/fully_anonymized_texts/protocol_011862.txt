AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:
 This amendment addresses a change to the month 12 time point and the final study 
encounter. Amendment 5 changed the designation of the final study event from “visit” to
“encounter” as the subject could be contact[CONTACT_3012]. However, activities in the final
study encounter that required an office visit remained in the Time and Events Table and 
in the text (Section 6.5) and need to be removed. Further, the language of “Final Study 
Encounter” was not carried throughout the protocol.
This amendment provides editorial/administrative changes to the protocol to clarify the 
language surrounding the Final Study Encounter throughout the protocol and the 
activities associated with that encounter. The random (non-fasting) glucose originally
scheduled for the Final Study Encounter has been moved to the 12-month time point in
the protocol. Additionally, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704063]. Victoria 
Bae-Jump.
The Eligibility criteria has been changed from excluding subjects with current use of
progestin therapy to excluding subjects with current use of progestin therapy that has 
been ongoing for > 3 months.  
Editorial Changes:
1. Section 6.4.3: Added a random (non-fasting)glucose as an evaluation at month 12.
2. Section 6.5: Changed the designation of from Final Study Visit to Final Study Encounter 
in the title and text. Changed wording that subjects “may” rather than “will” return to the 
clinic.  Removed the last sentence of the paragraph describing final study evaluation activities. 
3. Time and Events Table. Section 6.1:  Changed title of last column on the right to “Final 
Study Encounter.” Removed History and Physical, Random (non-fasting) glucose, and

AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:
The time measurements for the LCCC1326 trial were originally stipulated in a mix of 
weeks and months that could benefit from clarification.  In order to ensure consistent 
time measurement, this amendment modifies time references as needed. Additionally,
the required time limit for screening labs has been clarified to within 30 days.
 
This amendment also updates the exclusion criteria to remove the limit on tumor size of 
less than or equal to 2cm, as an aid in enrollment of additional subjects.
In addition, because UNC Lineberger recently changed its multicenter SOPs to allow for 
distribution of protocol amendments to all sites at the same time, this amendment 
modifies language in the protocol to allow that.
Additionally, the language explaining the Study Withdrawal process, as well as the 
language explaining the drug handling and disposal for Metformin, has been updated. 
Editorial Changes:
 
• Time measurements have been restated where needed for clarity and to facilitate 
analysis. These changes have been made in Sections 1.1, 1.3.3, 3.2.7, 3.2.10, 4.1,
4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1.6, 6.1, and 6.4.2.  
 
•In Sections 4.2 and 5.4, the timing of screening labs has been clarified to within
30 days of starting treatment. 
• The Study Withdrawal language in Section 4.10 has been updated in line with 
current process.

AMENDMENT RATIONALE AND SUMMARY:
We submit to you two changes to our screening procedures and one change to the 
wording in study information
 
1. Currently, we require cervical cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia prior to IUD placement for
a
ll patients enrolled on study. This is not the standard of care and was added in by [CONTACT_704087]. Since then, this has proved to be a significant 
impedance to successful enrollment as cultures are frequently collected at the time of IUD placement (to avoid multiple pelvic exams) and take [ADDRESS_956037] to 
return again for 3 months. The American College of OB/GYNs recommends that cervical cultures only be collected prior to IUD placement for women at high risk. The US preventative services 
task force recommends screening for STI for women age [ADDRESS_956038] changed verbiage surrounding the D&C procedure. The D&C procedure is frequently 
done to make a definitive diagnosis of hyperplasia or endometrial cancer; however, many women 
are diagnosed only on biopsy. If the primary provider does not feel that a D&C is necessary, many women will forgo the morbidity of the procedure and have the LR-IUD placed in clinic. 
We have changed the study design to reflect this practice pattern.

PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, [ADDRESS_956045] levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (LR-IUD) treatment of 30 
evaluable non-surgical patients with either complex atypi[INVESTIGATOR_97548] (CAH;
n=15) or grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma (EC; n=15). Women, over the age
of 18 years, with biopsy-proven CAH/EC who are not candidates for surgical 
management, and therefore are planned to start standard of care treatment with the 
LR-IUD, will be given oral metformin therapy for 12 months, or until disease
progression occurs (whichever occurs first), in addition to LR-IUD treatment.
Serial endometrial biopsies will be performed, as per standard of care, to assess 
disease status. We hypothesize that the addition of metformin to standard LR-IUD 
treatment of CAH and grade 1 EC will result in a complete response (CR) rate at
6 months that is significantly higher than 50% in a population of non-surgical
candidates.  In addition, we plan to estimate CR rate at [ADDRESS_956046] common cancer among women in the [LOCATION_002] (1). 
Type I or those tumors of endometrioid histology comprise 70-80% of cases and 
are thought to arise from unopposed estrogen stimulation, either endogenous or
exogenous. CAH is a neoplastic condition of the endometrium and is a precursor
lesion to EC. If untreated, CAH progresses to invasive cancer at a rate of 30% (2). 
In addition, CAH and grade 1 EC represent a spectrum of neoplasia, evidenced by 
a 40-50% rate of concurrent EC found on hysterectomy specimen when CAH is
present (3) as well as a concordance of only 40% among pathologists when
deciding between CAH and grade 1 EC (4). Given this overlap, these pathological 
diagnoses are treated similarly clinically. 
Obesity, which increases bioavailable estrogen levels by [CONTACT_704088], is a well-
established risk factor for type I EC and its precursor lesion, CAH, and has been
estimated to account for up to 40-90% percent of type I EC cases (5-7). Insulin
resistance, of which a marker is the level of adiponectin (a protein secreted by 
[CONTACT_704089]), characterizes obesity associated metabolic syndrome and diabetes. 
Low adiponectin levels, indicating insulin resistance, have been found to be
significantly associated with the development of EC (8). Correspondingly,
diabetes and insulin resistance have been linked to a 2-3 fold increased risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_704066] (8-11).  
The standard of care therapy for CAH and EC is surgical excision and staging.
However, there is a growing subset of patients for whom surgery is not an option. 
Due to the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_704067]-age women 
LCCC 1326  CONFIDENTIAL 
PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, 2020  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
    
2being diagnosed with CAH/EC, non-surgical options that can maintain fertility
and avoid operative risks are essential. Patients with major medical co-morbidity 
and poor performance status are not operative candidates, but require curative 
therapy for CAH/EC. A current accepted alternative treatment option for these
patients is long-term progesterone therapy in the form of the levonorgestrel-
releasing IUD (LR-IUD).  Gunderson and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis 
of 45 studies (n=391 subjects) evaluating women with CAH or EC undergoing 
progestin therapy (systemic therapy or LR-IUD). For the group as a whole, the
CR rate (as assessed via biopsy) was 66% for CAH and 48% for EC. (12) Median
time to response was 6 months. Importantly, 25% of CAH and 37% of EC 
patients experienced relapse after initial response (12). In the literature for 
CAH/EC, an assessment of response is categorized by [CONTACT_704090]-up biopsies. A complete response (“disease regression”) is defined as no
evidence of microscopic viable hyperplasia or cancer cells; stable disease 
(“disease persistence”) is defined as no change in biopsy status from prior to 
treatment; and progressive disease is defined as newly found or increase in grade
of adenocarcinoma from the pre-treatment biopsy (12, 13).
1.3 Metformin
An adjuvant therapy to progestins for CAH/EC may be metformin. Metformin is 
an anti-diabetic medication (biguanide class) that is widely used as the first line 
treatment of type II diabetes. It is an inexpensive, well-tolerated, effective
medication for normalizing hyperglycemia (14), and also prevents the
development of diabetes in patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome (15, 
16). Increasing epi[INVESTIGATOR_704068] (17-
19). In our own retrospective analysis of metformin and EC outcomes in diabetic
patients, metformin use was significantly associated with improved progression 
free survival (PFS;HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.70, p<0.01) and overall survival (OS; 
HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.59, p<0.0001) (20).
Metformin’s immediate downstream target is AMP-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK), and its activation by [CONTACT_704091], including inhibition of
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Alterations in the mTOR 
pathway, involving LKB1 and PTEN, have been implicated in EC carcinogenesis 
in up to 83% of type 1 ECs (21-23). Furthermore, our preliminary work reveals
that metformin is a potent inhibitor of cell proliferation in EC cell lines, through
inhibition of mTOR signaling (24).
 
Metformin may be effective in treating CAH and EC. In an animal mouse model
of endometrial hyperplasia (EH), metformin exhibited anti-proliferative effects on
the endometrium that coincided with inhibition of downstream targets of the 
mTOR pathway (25). Case reports have shown that metformin plus oral 
contraceptives, and metformin plus progesterone have been effectively used to
treat CAH refractory to progesterone alone (26, 27). Metformin has also been
LCCC 1326  CONFIDENTIAL 
PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, 2020  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
    
3implicated in the reversal of progestin resistance that can develop during long-
term treatment of CAH/EC with progestins (28), providing rationale for its use in 
combination with localized progestin therapy.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_956047] (29). A completed phase I study of temsirolimus and
metformin in advanced solid tumors demonstrated acceptable toxicity and 
promising response rates in a heavily pre-treated group of patients (30). In these 
trials, no significant toxicities were associated with metformin use in non-diabetic
patients. Additionally, in our own preoperative window study in obese
endometrial cancer patients, we did not find any significant toxicity and most of 
the women were non-diabetic. Taken together, these studies suggest a similar and 
favorable side effect profile between non-diabetics and diabetics taking
metformin.
1.3.2 Preliminary and Planned Studies of Metformin in EC
Pre-operative Window Study of Metformin.  Based on our preliminary in vitro 
work (24, 31), we conducted a pre-operative window study of metformin in EC 
patients at UNC-CH (LCCC 1102). In this study, obese women who were to
undergo surgical staging for EC received short-term treatment (2-4 weeks) with
metformin that continued until the day before their surgery. Metformin 
significantly reduced Ki-[ADDRESS_956048]-treatment hysterectomy specimens (mean of
19.5% decrease, p=0.026) (32). Metformin was also well tolerated with only two
grade 1 toxicities of mild abdominal pain and loose stools, which did not require 
discontinuation of treatment.
In addition, metformin treatment resulted in decreased expression of
phosphorylated AMPK (60.3%, p=0.[ZIP_CODE]), phosphorylated Akt (44.2%, 
p=0.0002), phosphorylated S6 (51.2%, p=0.0002) and phosphorylated 4E-BP-1 
(74.7%, p=0.001). Metformin decreased estrogen receptor (ER) expression
(65.7%, p=0.0002), but had no effect on progesterone (PR) expression.
Metabolomic profiling of serum indicated that treatment “responders” appeared 
more sensitive to metformin’s effect on central carbon metabolism, particularly 
with respect to systemic lipolysis, which correlated with a shift in lipid and
carbohydrate metabolism in their corresponding tumors.
 
The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has recently approved a clinical trial of 
metformin in EC patients, and [CONTACT_704128]-Jump is the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704069]. This trial is a two arm, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II/III trial
designed to assess the efficacy and safety of metformin in combination with

4paclitaxel and carboplatin versus paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in women with
advanced and recurrent EC. This trial is set to open for enrollment in 2013.  
 
Metformin Transporter Proteins. One critical, unanswered question in regards
to the action of metformin is the extent to which this drug accumulates inneoplastic tissues. Metformin is highly hydrophilic with a net positive charge at 
all physiologic pH values. Therefore, it requires cation-selective transport proteins 
that mediate its entry into cells. The cation-selective transporters organic cation
transporter (OCT)1-3, plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) and
multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE) 1-2 mediate metformin 
transport in the liver, intestine, and kidney(33-39) Less is known about the 
expression of these transporter proteins in solid tumors. Studies in our laboratory
show that metformin uptake into human breast cancer cell lines are dictated by [CONTACT_704092]-selective transporters (unpublished data). 
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that metformin uptake into endometrial 
cancer cell lines and tissues must be mediated by [CONTACT_704093]-selective
transporters.
 
Initial real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments to determine if 
cation-selective metformin transporters are expressed in endometrial cancer cell
lines showed that all transporters of interest are present at varying levels
(unpublished data). MATE1 and [ADDRESS_956049] highly expressed transporters in 
endometrial cancer cell lines (Ishikawa and ECC-1) while OCT2 and [ADDRESS_956050] expressed transporters. In the serous endometrial cancer cell line (SPEC-2),
MATE1 and PMAT expression predominated, with much decreased expression of
MATE2. We also assessed the expression of the metformin transporter proteins in 
fifteen human endometrial cancer specimens and adjacent benign tissues. MATE1 
was found to be the predominant transporter in endometrial tumor and benign
tissues; however, PMAT and OCT3 were also expressed in significant amounts.
Thus, we anticipate that the highly expressed MATE1 will facilitate metformin 
intracellular uptake into endometrial tumors and be predictive of treatment 
response to this agent.
1.3.3 Metformin Associated Toxicities
The risks of metformin treatment in patients with CAH/EC are minimal.
Metformin is one of the most common drugs used for the treatment of type II 
diabetes mellitus as well as for ovulation induction in Polycystic Ovarian 
Syndrome (PCOS) patients. For the purpose of this study, patients will be taking a
standard clinical dose of metformin that is used commonly in the treatment of
type II diabetes.
 
The usual dose of metformin is 850-1,000 mg twice daily. The maximum safe
dose is thought to be 850 mg three times daily. To minimize gastrointestinal (GI)
upset or diarrhea, it is recommended to start with a low dose and work up to the 
recommended dose. Thus, we plan to start with the dose of 850 mg once a day 
and titrate this to 850 mg twice a day, over the course of 30 days. This twice a day
LCCC 1326  CONFIDENTIAL 
PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, 2020  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
    
5regimen is also the dose that is commonly being used in clinical trials for
metformin as cancer treatment (see www.clinicaltrials.gov for ongoing clinical 
trials of metformin for cancer treatment).  
 
GI side effects are by [CONTACT_704094] (30% of patients) and include abdominal bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, 
nausea and vomiting, weight loss and loss of appetite. Lactic acidosis is a rare
(0.03 cases per 1000 patient-years, with 0.015 fatal cases per 1000 patient-years)
but life threatening complication. Predisposing risk factors in patients who 
developed lactic acidosis included decreased liver and kidney function and age 
greater than [ADDRESS_956051] media and surgical
procedures or drugs that decrease fluid intake and tissue perfusion (e.g. 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], furosemide and cationic drugs). Of note, in more than 20,[ADDRESS_956052] been no incidents of
lactic acidosis (see http://packageinserts.bms.com/pi/pi_glucophage.pdf ). Recent
literature has demonstrated that metformin is safe in patients with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even patients 
with mild renal impairment (40, 41). However, for precautionary measures, in
this study patients will be required to stop metformin for [ADDRESS_956053] media.  
 
Long-term (years) use of metformin has been associated with vitamin B-12
deficiency. Hepatotoxicity is also rare with an incidence of less than 0.1% (3 case
reports in the literature). In all cases, liver enzymes returned to normal after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23256]. Other rare side effects include rash, headache, agitation, 
dizziness and tiredness.
Hypoglycemia is rare when metformin is given in therapeutic doses, but may
result if caloric intake is insufficient or if strenuous exercise occurs without
adequate intake of calories. The risk is slightly higher for those patients who are 
taking metformin in combination with the following other oral medications for 
diabetes, including glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], glyburide and sitagliptin. However, in the
management of diabetes, metformin is routinely combined with these other oral
agents, indicating the overall safety of this drug.
 
With regard to non-diabetic patients, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
studies do not reveal a change in basal glucose level in non-diabetic metformin
users versus placebo. In a randomized study between healthy controls and 
randomized first degree normoglycemic relatives of patients with non-insulin 
dependent diabetes, basal glucose level did not differ between the groups and was
within normal parameters (42). Metformin use in healthy males under strenuous
exercise conditions did not induce higher rates of lactic acidosis and plasma 
glucose levels were similar in healthy subjects who received metformin versus 
placebo (43). Metformin appears to differentially act upon the erythrocyte
insulin binding receptors in obese non-insulin dependent diabetics and non-
diabetics; it increased the receptor capacity dramatically in the diabetics and only

mainly in Type II diabetics but not in non-diabetics (44). 
1.4 Study Rationale
Unfortunately, 25% of CAH and 37% of EC patients go on to relapse after 
treatment with hormonal therapy. Relapse of CAH/EC patients after treatment
with progesterone is thought to be related to progesterone resistance. Metformin is
a generic oral anti-hyperglycemic. Recent evidence suggests that metformin 
reduces cancer risk and cancer deaths among diabetic patients (17-19). Based on 
preclinical in vitro andin vivo studies, metformin demonstrates anti-proliferative
effects for both endometrial hyperplasia and cancer through inhibition of the
mTOR pathway. Metformin has also demonstrated reversal of progesterone-
resistance in endometrial cancer cell lines. In clinical data, metformin has been 
associated with decreased cellular proliferation (via Ki-67 staining) in
endometrial cancer specimens of patients undergoing primary surgical
management. Given our promising preclinical data, we hypothesize that the 
addition of metformin to standard LR-IUD progestin therapy will result in a CR 
rate at 6 months that is significantly higher than 50%. The comparator rate of
50% is based on results reported in the meta-analysis referenced earlier, andbecause a response rate significantly greater than this will be considered clinically 
meaningful by [CONTACT_473]. The rate of CR at [ADDRESS_956055] as this was the median time to response in the meta-analysis (12). Due to
metformin’s long term and wide spread use in patients with significant
comorbidity, as well as proven safety and efficacy in healthy women with PCOS 
and non-diabetics, it is an ideal medication to evaluate in a population of non-
surgical candidates.
In addition, our proposed clinical trial of metformin in combination with the LR-
IUD will complement the proposed GOG trial in that we will (1) explore the 
potential activity of metformin in CAH and early stage EC patients as opposed to
the advanced and recurrent patient population, and (2) we will investigate the
combination of metformin with hormonal as opposed to cytotoxic therapy. If 
these study results are positive, we plan to propose a multicenter GOG trial of this 
treatment regimen, to establish a new standard of care for non-surgical patients
with CAH/EC.
1.5 Correlative Studies
We will explore the association of metabolic factors, expression of the metformin 
transporter proteins and key targets of the metformin/mTOR signaling pathway 
(i.e. Ki-67, AMPK, LKB1, AKT, PTEN, S6, 4E-BP1) with treatment response to
metformin. Metabolic factors, including baseline body mass index (BMI), and
glucose levels, will be documented and followed throughout treatment. Matched 
paraffin embedded tissues before and during metformin treatment will also be 
collected for immunohistochemical analysis of the metformin transporter proteins,
Ki-67, and key components of the metformin/mTOR signaling pathway. Blood
and urine will be collected at baseline and every 3 months during the study as a

therapeutic outcomes, and (2) identify metabolic biomarkers of response to 
treatment through metabolomic profiling. Endometrial tissue will also be 
collected at the 6 month time point for analysis of metformin uptake into the
endometrium.

10 4.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
4.1 Schema
This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, study of the addition of metformin 
to the LR-IUD for treatment of non-surgical patients with CAH and grade 1 EC. 
While patients will be enrolled prior to dilation and curettage (D&C) and
placement of the LR-IUD, both are standard of care, and will not be impacted by
[CONTACT_704101]. 
 
Oral metformin therapy will be started within 1 week of LR-IUD placement and
continued for 12 months unless disease progression occurs or the patient develops
intolerability.
4.2 Dilation and Curettage (D&C)
As part of standard of care in treating CAH and EC with non-surgical progestin 
therapy, patients will undergo a D&C procedure for definitive diagnosis and
therapeutic effect. During this procedure, the LR-IUD is placed. D&C is a safe,outpatient procedure that will be performed by a gynecologic oncology attending, 
fellow, or resident. In this procedure, the uterine lining tissue is removed with 
standard curette instruments. The main risk of this procedure is uterine
perforation, which occurs at a rate of 1-2%. D&C would be performed regardless
of study enrollment, and is not considered part of the current study. However, 
confirmation of CAH or EC will not be made, and therefore metformin will not be 
started, until after results of the D&C are read by [CONTACT_978]. This will occur within 3
days of receipt of the results and 7 days of the procedure and the patient will be
informed that they can then initiate metformin. If a patient's provider does not feel 
LCCC 1326  CONFIDENTIAL 
PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, 2020  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
    
11 that they require a D&C procedure, the LR-IUD may be placed in clinic. The
pati
ent will undergo screening and pre-treatment testing at this time or the visit 
prior to the LR-IUD placement and will start the metformin within [ADDRESS_956060] of care. Once the diagnosis
of CAH or EC is confirmed by D&C, patients will be additionally treated with
metformin as an investigational agent. Patients will be started on the standard 
clinical starting dose of metformin (850 mg once daily orally, titrated to twice 
daily over the course of one month (30 days)). This dose of 850mg twice daily
will be continued for the duration of their prescribed study treatment. Patients will
fill out a pi[INVESTIGATOR_704071]. This diary will be provided to patients as 
a document separate from this protocol. Metformin will be obtained and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_704102]. The
participating research sites have experience with metformin administration on
clinical trials and will be well versed in managing dose escalation and side-
effects. Patients will be instructed to take metformin with meals. 
4.4 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.Each patient will be assessed weekly for the first 2 weeks, then every 30 days
thereafter for the development of any toxicity according to the Time and Events 
table (6.0). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAEv4. Dose 
adjustments should be made according to the system showing the greatest degree
of toxicity.
 
We anticipate that metformin related hypoglycemia and GI disturbances will be 
the two most common side effects. Metformin will be discontinued if the patient
experiences (1) a single grade 3 or higher metformin-related GI disturbance or
grade 4 or higher hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or (2) two or more grade 2 side effects 
considered related to metformin therapy, or (3) if the patient requires a dose less 
than 850mg once daily. Patients may request to stop the drug at any time.

immediately. If the level is below 70 mg/dL, one of the above quick-fix foods
would be consumed right away to raise their blood glucose. Patients will be 
instructed to recheck their blood glucose in 15 minutes to make sure it is 70 
mg/dL or above. If it is still too low, another serving of a quick-fix food should be
eaten. These steps should be repeated until the blood glucose level is 70 mg/dL or
above. As stated previously, hypoglycemia is less likely in non-diabetic patients. 
If this were to occur, they will be managed in the same manner as detailed above.

Endometrial biopsies will be performed either by a gynecologic oncology 
attending, gynecology attending, gynecology resident or gynecologic oncology
clinical fellow. Patients will be offered acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (i.e. ibuprofen) if needed for uterine crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Patients will 
be given appropriate instruction on fever and bleeding precautions during the 
surgical procedure consent process.
An endometrial suction curette (e.g., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_501180]®) will be used to sample the 
endometrial lining for each follow up biopsy. These disposable devices are 
constructed of flexible polypropylene with an outer sheath measuring
approximately [ADDRESS_956066] endometrial disease, especially the
sensitivity of detecting endometrial cancer is 83% to 96% (47-50).
 
The most common risks to the patient for this procedure are crampi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] a vaso-
vagal response. Other much rarer risks included uterine bleeding (usually due to
previously undiagnosed coagulopathies), uterine perforation (0.1 – 1.3%), pelvic
infection and bacteremia (<1%). Besides these risks, there are no known 
additional risks to patients undergoing multiple endometrial biopsies. These 
procedures would be performed regardless of study enrollment.
4.7 Duration of Metformin Therapy 
The planned duration of metformin therapy is 12 months. Metformin treatment
will be discontinued early in the following scenarios: 
•Progression of disease, as defined by [CONTACT_704103] [ADDRESS_956067] of care biopsies at 3, 6, and 9 months. In any of these cases, 
metformin will be discontinued within 3 days of results of the biopsy.
•Unacceptable toxicity as defined by a single grade 3 or higher GI disturbance
attributed to metformin, a single grade 4 or higher hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 2 or 
more grade 2 toxicities attributed to metformin, or requirement for a dose 
below 850 mg once daily.

care, endometrial biopsies will be performed every 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) to 
assess histology and grade to determine response. This will be the basis of
whether therapy should continue. If the 3 month biopsy demonstrates disease
progression, the patient will be removed from protocol directed treatment and 
followed-up per protocol, and treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Otherwise, therapy will continue through 6 months. If the 6-
month or 9-month biopsy demonstrates complete response (complete disease
regression) or partial response (partial disease regression), metformin will be 
continued until 12 months of total therapy is given. If the 6-month or 9-month 
biopsy demonstrates stable disease, continuation of metformin on study will be at
the discretion of the treating physician. Please see the schema (section 4.1) for
clarity.
 
In addition, treatment will be stopped in the setting of:
•Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment
•Pregnancy 
•Patient decides to withdraw from study treatment, OR
•General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the 
patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the
investigator.
4.8 Duration of Follow Up
Patients will be followed until their final study encounter (this may be a clinic 
visit, or phone call), which will occur within 30 days of their final endometrial 
biopsy while on metformin. Metformin is to be stopped the day of the 12-month
endometrial biopsy, or the day on which the results of prior biopsies are known, if
they indicate disease progression. In the case of ongoing adverse events/serious 
adverse event, patients will be followed to resolution of the event. 
4.9 Removal of Patients from Protocol Therapy 
Patients will be removed from protocol therapy when any of the criteria listed in
section 4.7 apply. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10718], and the reason for
study removal and the date the patient was removed will be documented in the 
electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF).  
In case a patient decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses
treatment”), the patient should be asked if she may still be contact[CONTACT_328800]. The outcome of that discussion should be 
documented in both the medical records and in the eCRF.
Excessive patient withdrawals from protocol therapy or from the study can render 
the study un-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should 
be avoided.

5.0 DRUG INFORMATION
5.1 Commercial Drug Description and Management -Metformin
5.1.1 Mechanism of Action/Indications 
Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in
patients with type II diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma
glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes 
of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose 
production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin
sensitivity by [CONTACT_381349]. Unlike
sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with 
type II diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see adverse 
events section) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy,
insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long
plasma insulin response may actually decrease.  
5.1.2 Supplier/How Supplied
Metformin is generic and made by [CONTACT_704104]. Investigational Drug Services at participating centers will be responsible for the purchase and
distribution of metformin to the patients enrolled in this study. Patients will be
provided metformin free of charge for this trial.

5.1.3 Dosage and Administration 
For type II diabetes mellitus, the initial recommended dosage of metformin is 500
mg twice daily or 850 mg once daily given with meals, and then titrated to twice
daily dosing. For this study, patient will take 850 mg once daily, and this dose 
will be titrated to twice daily dosing. Metformin should be taken with meals.
5.1.4 Storage and Stability 
Metformin should be stored between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius (68 and 77°F)
with excursions permitted between 15 and 30°C (59 and 86°F). Metformin is
dispensed in a light-resistant container.

5.2 Commercial Drug Description and Management- Levonorgestrel-Releasing 
Intrauterine Device 
Mechanism of Action and Indications
The LR-IUD is commercially available as the Mirena© intrauterine system. It is a 
sterile T-shaped polyethylene frame with a steroid reservoir containing 52 mg of 
levonorgestrel. It is a long-term contraceptive agent and used to treat heavy
menstrual bleeding. The mechanism of action that prevent pregnancy include
thickening of the cervical mucus, inhibition of sperm capacitation, and alterations 
of the endometrium. The alterations of the endometrium are a result of local 
progestin effects and include stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy, a
leukocytic infiltration and a decrease in glandular and stromal mitoses. Due to
these effects, the LR-IUD has been used in diseases previously treated with oral 
progestin therapy - heavy menstrual bleeding and hyperplasia and early 
endometrial adenocarcinoma.
Supplier/How Supplied
The LR-IUD is currently only commercially available in the Mirena© intrauterine 
system. As a standard alternative treatment for hyperplasia and early stage
endometrial adenocarcinoma, it is reimbursed by [CONTACT_704106]. Patients and/or their insurance companies will be 
billed for this product.
Formulation/Dosage and Administration
The LR-IUD contains 52 mg total of levonorgestrel and releases approximately 
20 mcg/day.   
Storage/Stability
Mirena© is supplied sterile and is sterilized with ethylene oxide. It is stored at 
25°C with excursions permitted between 15-30°C. If the package seal is disrupted 
prior to use, it must be discarded. It cannot be re-sterilized.
5.[ADDRESS_956072] comment adverse reactions associated with the LR-IUD is change in
menstrual bleeding pattern, abdominal/pelvic pain, and the formation of 
headache/migraines. As part of standard therapy, patients would be counseled 
about these possible effects. They will be instructed to call the gynecologic
oncology clinic if any concerns arise.
 
The majority of LR-IUD users experience resolution of such symptoms between 1

Metformin is to be stopped the day of the 12-month endometrial biopsy, or the
day on which the results of prior biopsies are known, if they indicate disease 
progression. In the case of ongoing adverse events/serious adverse event, patients 
will be followed to resolution of the event. After completion of metformin
treatment, patients may return to clinic as per scheduled with their primary
provider. The final study encounter will be within 30 days of the final endometrial 
biopsy.  
6.6 Early Termination/Study Withdrawal Visit 
If early termination of the study occurs (i.e., prior to 12 months), the patient willbe asked to have serum and urine collected, and their standard of care every 3
month endometrial biopsy will be performed as scheduled by [CONTACT_704115]. No other evaluations will be needed in the event of early 
termination. Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from participation in the study at
any time (see section 4.10). Subjects may also withdraw voluntarily from
receiving the study intervention for any reason.   
 
If voluntary withdrawal occurs due to an adverse event, the subject will be given
appropriate care under medical supervision until the symptoms of any adverse
event resolve or the subject’s condition becomes stable.  
6.[ADDRESS_956081] endometrial tissue for the correlative studies (i.e.
measure metformin concentration and metabolomic profiling). The time at which 
the last dose of metformin was taken prior to endometrial biopsy will be recorded.  
Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected from clinic and
transported to the Tissue Procurement Facility for coding (to remove patient
identifiers) and eventual distribution to the Principal Investigator.  Samples will 
include: (1) a total of 10 cc of blood collected in a gold-top tube, (2) a total of 10 
cc of blood collected in a green top heparinized tube, and (3) a minimum of 40 cc
of urine collected in a non-sterile urine-specimen container. In addition, the
endometrial biopsy slides and blocks (pretreatment samples) will be obtained 
from referring physicians of these patients for analysis in this study. These slides 
will also be compared to those obtained from serial endometrial biopsies, as a
means to delineate the effect of metformin treatment. Tissue, blood and urine
samples will be packaged and transported to the laboratory for determination of 
metformin concentration and metabolomic profiling.  
Analysis of metformin in plasma and urine: Metformin concentrations in
plasma and urine will be determined using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass 
spectrometry method in [CONTACT_704129]’s laboratory.

in endometrial tissue will be determined using liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), as previously described (51). This will be performed 
in the laboratory of [CONTACT_704129].
Ki-67: Tissue microarrays will be constructed and immunohistochemical analysis 
will be performed to assess for Ki-67. The percentage of Ki-[ADDRESS_956082]-treatment. The Ki-max

[CONTACT_704116]. Individual 
slides will be digitized using the Aperio ScanScope (Aperio Technologies, Vista, 
CA), and digital images will be analyzed using Aperio ImageScope software.
Immunohistochemical Analysis: Tissue microarrays will be constructed and 
immunohistochemical analysis will be performed to assess expression of the key 
components of the metformin/mTOR, including AMPK, LKB1, Akt, PTEN,
S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of these
proteins will be evaluated. Expression of the metformin transporter proteins will 
also be assessed by [CONTACT_704117], including OCT1-3, MATE1/2 
and PMAT. Stained slides will be visually scored by [CONTACT_704118].
Individual slides will be digitized using the Aperio ScanScope (Aperio

Metformin Transporter mRNA Expression in Endometrial Tissues. Total 
RNA will be isolated from EH paraffin-embedded tissues and subjected to RT-
PCR for determination of metformin transporter mRNA expression, including
OCT1-3, MATE1/2 and PMAT. The relative mRNA levels for individual
transporters will be normalized to the 18s rRNA housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_171520].
 
Metabolomic Analysis: We will perform comprehensive metabolomic analysis
of serum and urine to identify potential biomarkers responsive to metformintreatment using mass spectrometry. These analyses uncover the subtle differences 
between the spectra that correlate to the disease or treatment under study 
revealing metabolomic “footprints” (from tissue) and “fingerprints” (from
biofluids). Thus, a comprehensive unbiased profiling of metabolites (molecule
weight<1000 Dalton) will be performed, and we will analyze the metabolic 
“fingerprints” of the biofluids (i.e. serum and urine) of women with endometrial 
hyperplasia/cancer, pre- and post- 6 months of metformin treatment. Time of
flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) coupled to chromatographic separations
including gas chromatography (GC-TOF-MS, Leco Corp.) and liquid 
chromatography (LC-TOF-MS, Agilent Corp.) will be used for the measurement 
of tumor specimens and biofluids, and these analyses will be conducted according

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal product.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544695] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered 
AEs and should not be recorded as an AE. Disease progression should not be
recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_353202].
7.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug is the cause. Reasonable possibility means that there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A
suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
LCCC 1326  CONFIDENTIAL 
PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, 2020  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
    
26 Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration
of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, 
known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent 
or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under
investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions. Other
factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson
Syndrome)
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon
rupture); often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies
would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is 
reasonable possibility  that the drug caused the event.
•An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that
indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group 
7.1.[ADDRESS_956084] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure
(IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of 
product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected also refers to AEs 
or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
7.1.4 Serious AE or SAR
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death;
•Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred);
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*
•Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;
•Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions;
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences 
of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important
medical event.

treatment and continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is
discontinued. 
 
Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for
that patient. Please include a description of the event, its severity or toxicity
grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study
drug.   Documentation should occur at least monthly.
7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs  
7.3.1 Timing
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs
caused by a protocol-mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs related to 
invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run-
in).
For any other experience or condition that meets the definition of an SAE or a
serious SAR, recording of the event must begin from day 1 of study treatment and 
continue through the 30 day follow-up period after treatment is discontinued.
7.3.2 Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded in the SAE console
within Oncore™ for that patient within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.
7.3.3 Reporting
IRB Reporting Requirements:
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually 
at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and
procedures.
• The UNC-IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web-
based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the Investigator
becoming aware of the problem.
•  For affiliate sites using a local IRB of record, please submit adverse 
events per local IRB policy.

will be submitted to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal 
according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures. In addition, any SAEs 
that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem will be entered into Oncore and
reported to the UNC IRB by [CONTACT_704120]’s
web-based reporting system (see section 9.5.3) within 7 days of the
Investigator becoming aware of the problem.
Pregnancy
Pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease
state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study should be
recorded as SAEs. The patient is to be discontinued immediately from the study.
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably 
one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, 
and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal
outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or
therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an
AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.
7.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_704074]
(DSMC).  
Meetings/teleconferences will be held at a frequency dependent on study accrual,
and in consultation with the study Biostatistician.  These meetings will include the 
investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory 
associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the
principal investigators may deem appropriate. At these meetings, the research
team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollment, 
safety, regulatory issues, and data collection.
The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries
will be available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_544714], but 
not limited to, the oversight (Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE)
Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North
Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 
The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the
study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review
based on risk and complexity as determined by [CONTACT_650671]. The UNC PI [INVESTIGATOR_704075] 1326  CONFIDENTIAL

8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
8.1 Study Design 
This is an open label, single-arm, multi-center study of metformin in addition to
the LR-IUD for the treatment of non-surgical patients with CAH and grade 1 EC.
We hypothesize that metformin + LR-IUD will result in a CR rate at 6 months
that is significantly higher than 50%.
8.2 Sample Size, Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020], and Accrual 
The goal accrual is 32 patients (16 CAH, 16 EC) and we expect to enroll 1-2patients/per month. Our power calculation and analysis will be based on 30
patients, assuming early discontinuation of 2 participants prior to 3 months of 
treatment. We estimate 18 months to complete accrual.
The primary objective of this study is to compare the CR rate at 6 months to a rate 
of 50% (the 50% is based on results reported in the meta-analysis referenced 
earlier, and because a response rate significantly greater than this will be
considered clinically meaningful by [CONTACT_473]). With a combined sample
size of 30 evaluable patients with either CAH or grade 1 EC, and assuming a null
CR rate of 50% and an alternative of 75%, we will have 80% power to conclude
that the CR rate at 6 months is significantly higher than 50% using an exact test
for a single proportion with a two- sidedαof0.05. Furthermore, the exact 95%
confidence interval for the CR rate at [ADDRESS_956086] 18.7%. CAH
and grade 1 EC represent a spectrum of neoplasia, which is why the two groups
are being combined for the primary objective. The CR rate at 6 months will be
estimated separately in the CAH and EC groups as a secondary objective.
 
Sequential boundaries will be used to suspend the trial if excessive toxicity is seen
that requires discontinuation of metformin. If the study reaches a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_704076], it may be terminated by [CONTACT_978], or submitted to the DSMC with a
description of the toxicities and a rationale for why the study should be continued. 
At the patient level, metformin will be discontinued if a patient experiences: (1) a
single grade 3 or higher metformin-related GI disturbance or grade 4 or higher
hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or (2) two or more grade 2 side effects considered related 
to metformin therapy, or (3) if the patient requires a dose less than 850mg once 
daily. The accrual will be halted if the number of patients discontinuing
metformin for one of the reasons above is equal to or exceeds b
nout of npatients
who have been followed for toxicity for 3 months. This is a Pocock type stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_704077] 1326  CONFIDENTIAL 
PI/Version Date: Bae-Jump/May 15, 2020  UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
    
30 boundary that assumes that a metformin discontinuation rate of 0.25 is acceptable,
but anything >25% is unacceptable. If the true toxicity rate is equal to 0.25, the 
probability of crossing the boundary is 0.05. 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_704078], n [ADDRESS_956087] the hypothesis that the CR
rate at 6 months for the group as a whole is greater than 50%. The CR rates at [ADDRESS_956088] 95% confidence
intervals. Patients who progress at [ADDRESS_956089] 80% of planned metformin doses over the course of treatment. The
adherence rate will be estimated and reported along with an exact 95% confidence 
interval. All patients who initiated treatment on study will be included in this
analysis. Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_704121].
 
Changes in Ki-[ADDRESS_956090] as appropriate. Fisher’s exact tests will be used
to explore associations between expression (via IHC) of the metformin transporter 
proteins and key targets of the metformin/mTOR signaling pathway and CR at 6 
months. Two-sample t-tests will be used to explore associations between
metabolic factors and CR. Correlation coefficients and regression models will be
used to explore associations between metabolic factors and metformin 
concentration levels in tumor tissue. Profiling of metabolites and all associated
metabolomic analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_704119]/Nutrition Research

According to UNC’s IRB, a protocol deviation is any unplanned variance from an
IRB approved protocol that:
•Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs 
•Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants
•Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan 
or the value of the data collected
•Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the
investigator(s).
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation if the variance meets
any of the following criteria:
•Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research
participants.
•Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.
•Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the
investigator(s).
•Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal
regulations, State laws, or University policies.
If a deviation or violation occurs please follow the guidelines below: 
 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB:
Protocol Deviations: UNC or Affiliate personnel will record the deviation in
OnCore®, and report to any sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in
accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to
the IRB at the time of continuing review.

34 Protocol Violations: Violations should be reported by [CONTACT_65478]
(1) week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB 
online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.   
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB:
In addition to adhering to the policies regarding protocol compliance set forth by 
[CONTACT_106954]’s IRB, the following is also required: 
Protocol Deviations: In the event a deviation from protocol procedures is
identified, record the deviation in OnCore®. 
 
Protocol Violations: Any protocol violation that occurs must be reported to your
IRB per institutional policies and reported to the UNCCN Project Manager within5 days. UNC-CH will determine if the violation affects the safety of the patient
and integrity of the data. Once your institution’s IRB response is received, please 
forward to the UNCCN Regulatory Associate.
Unanticipated Problems:
 
Affiliate Sites:
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems (UPs)” as definedby [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB must also be reported to the UNCCN Project Manager. The
UNCCN Project Manager will report the event to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s
web-based reporting system.  Examples of such UPs include a lost or stolen 
laptop computer that contains sensitive study information.
UNC 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined by 
[CONTACT_11604]’s IRB must be reported by [CONTACT_65479]’s web-
based reporting system.
9.6 Amendments to the Protocol
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be 
originated and documented by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_353190]. It should also 
be noted that when an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study
design or the potential risk to the patient, a revised consent form might be
required.   
 
For Institutions Relying on UNC’s IRB:
The written amendment, and if required the amended consent form, must be sent
to UNC’s IRB for approval prior to implementation.
 
For Institutions Relying on Their Own IRB:
Investigators must submit the approved amendment to their institution’s IRB forapproval.  For multi-center studies, any multicenter site must submit their
informed consent revisions to the Multicenter Regulatory Associate prior to
submission to their IRB.

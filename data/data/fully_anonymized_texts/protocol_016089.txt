1 INTRODUCTION  
 Background and Rationale  1.1
1.1.1 COVID -19 and Global Pandemic  
 
The global pandemic of coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19), secondary to the severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] -2 (SARS -CoV -2), represents an emergent threat 
to public health, with a quoted mortality rate among inpa tients greater than 25 % (1). 
Containment strategies have been employed to varying degrees and effects in Western 
nations, now necessitating mitigation strategies in overwhelmed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709887] -19. Limited intensive care unit - (ICU) level resources such as 
mechanical ventilation and other in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709888] 
a significant r ole in the poor clinical outcomes associated with COVID -19 (2-4). 
Moreover, the throughput and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709889] a role in the “logjam” of available resources in a pandemic. Therefore , 
early identification of patients at risk for clinical decompensation , imminently preventing 
their decompensation so as to preserve as many ICU -level resources as possible , and 
decreasing the length of stay of non -critically ill patients are  all crucial at a public health 
level to navigate the COV ID-[ADDRESS_965231]. The pneumonitis associated 
COVID -19 disease exists on a continuum, ranging from (on one extreme) bilateral 
infiltrates and associated respi[INVESTIGATOR_182569], hyperinflammation, and septic shock leading 
to death to (at the other extreme) absence of pulmonary infiltrates  and very mild 
symptoms . For the purposes of this study, patients meet diagnostic criteria for COVID -[ADDRESS_965232] : 1) positive SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_965233] and 2) evidence of an infiltrate on chest imaging. P atients with COVID -[ADDRESS_965234] pulmonary 
infiltrates are  generally  at low risk for progression to pneumonitis and  clinical 
decompensation, ICU resource utilization, and death. For the purposes of our study, we 
will focus primarily on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709890]19 pneumonitis who 
are not designated to be critically ill as delineated by [CONTACT_709917] (Figure 
1). Based on previously published data, (1) we can broadly risk -stratify patients who 
meet diagnostic criteria for pneumonitis according to their risk of clinical 
decompensation, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and death. The first division in the 
risk stratification schema is between patients who are critically ill (Figure 1) and those

                                                                                                                who are not. Within the subpopulation who are not critically ill, there are those with 
relatively high risk for decompensation, ICU utilization, and COVID -19-related mortality 
(Group A; Figure 2) and those with relatively low risk for these same outcomes (Group 
B; Figure 3).   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Defining the Subpopulation of Critically Ill Patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_965235] are critically ill patients with COVID -19 pneumonitis who are already utilizing 
near-ICU or ICU -level resources. These patients (Figure 1) have polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) -proven SARS -CoV -2 infection, radiographic evi dence of infiltrates, and 
physiologic signs of pneumonitis and COVID -19 related hyperinflammation marked by 
[CONTACT_709918][INVESTIGATOR_709891] 30 per minute, oxygen 
saturation of 93% or less in ambient air (for patients witho ut baseline supplemental 
oxygen requirement), or a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) -fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] 
(FiO2) ratio of less than or equal to 300 mmHg. In addition, critical patients will be 
defined as having  one or more of either respi[INVESTIGATOR_709892] (invasive or non -invasive), shock of any form requiring the use of a 
vasopressor medication, or multi -organ failure.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Defining and Risk -Stratifying within the Subpopulation of Non -Critically Ill 
Patients with C OVID -[ADDRESS_965236] risk, however, of clinical decompensati on, utilization of ICU -level 
resources, and ultimately COVID -19 disease -related mortality. This population of 
patients can itself be thought of as two subpopulations: One has relatively high risk for 
progression to critical COVID -19 disease and ultimately COVID -19 disease -related

a multi -disciplinary panel of experts,  include epi[INVESTIGATOR_709893] -based signs of hyperinfla mmation. The second 
subpopulation is comprised of patients (hereafter ‘Group B’) (Figure 3) who have 
COVID -[ADDRESS_965237] risk of clinical decompensation, 
utilization of ICU -level resources, and COVID -19 disease -related mortality and may 
benefit from early treatment with medications aimed at managing COVID -19 disease -
related CRS. As a public health measure, early treatment may help to preserve limited 
ICU resources.

1.1.3 Parallels Between COVID -19 and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T -Cell 
(CAR -T)- Related Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)  
 
COVID -19’s high mortality may in part be driven by [CONTACT_709919] (CRS), offering the hope that immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_709895] – such as the interleukin -6 (IL -6) receptor -targeted monoclonal 
antibodies tocilizumab or sarilumab and IL -6 targeted monoclonal antibody siltuximab – 
can be used to reduce mortality in COVID -19 (Figure 4)  (5). Emerging evidence shows 
marked elevation of serum IL -6, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase, and 
ferritin in patients with COVID -19, with the degree of elevation correlating with severity 
of disease  (1, 6, 7) . Early data suggest IL -6 axis suppression has promise. Retrospective 
analysis  of severe to critical COVID -19 patients receiving  tocilizumab 400 mg 
(approximately 6.67 mg/kg using average Chinese body weight) demonstrated that 
greater than 75% of patients had rapid resolution (i.e., within 24 -72 hours following 
administration) of bo th clinical and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of

supply/demand mismatch, t hree challenges must be overcome: 1) demand must be 
reduced through maximal containment measures, 2) the available medication’s 
distribution channels must be improved, and 3) the effective supply of the medications 
must be increased by [CONTACT_495632][INVESTIGATOR_709899] -IL-6 therapy as much as 
possible.  
 
1.1.6 Interventional pharmacoeconomics to increase effective supply  
 
We can draw on lessons from the new field of interventional pharmacoeconomics  (IVPE) 
to increase the effective supply of anti -IL-6 therapy  (14). Many monoclonal antibodies 
used in both oncologic and rheu matologic indications in the outpatient setting  have 
labeled doses and schedules aimed at maintaining a therapeutic concentration for weeks. 
In contrast, in the inpatient setting, where a patient’s primary problem is expected to be 
temporary  and on the ord er of days , a lower  and more frequent dosing  of a monoclonal 
antibody  is preferable. This approach helps to minimize the total amount of medication 
used and reduce the frequency and/or duration of adverse events. This pharmacological 
line of reasoning is g ermane to COVID -19 and is a plausible strategy to conserve use of 
potentially efficacious and supply -limited anti -IL6 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Moreover, there is medical 
rationale in COVID -19: Immunosuppression for long periods of time of patients who are 
expected to ha ve long inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709900] , both of which have been concerns in patients with 
coronavirus infections  (15, 16) .  
 
 Tocilizumab  1.2
1.2.1 Clinical Studies  
 
Tocilizumab was originally developed for outpatient, every four -weeks administration in 
rheumatoid arthritis ( RA), giant cell arteritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis at a labeled dose of 8 mg/kg, with approval 
based on improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 score  (17). 
Dose -finding studies revealed a dose -related reduction in Disease Activity  Score in 28 
joints (DAS28) beyond 4 weeks at doses 4mg/kg and 8mg/kg  (17). In its subsequent new 
drug application for treating CRS in chimeric antigen receptor T cell  (CAR T) therapy, 
no formal dose -finding study was performed and tocilizumab was approved after the 
8mg/kg dose, provisioned up to four times at least eight hours apart, led to resolution of 
CRS within a 14 -day period of time (the primary outcome measure for these purposes)  
(17).  Response data from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) filings, however, 
suggest a 4 mg/kg dose had similar efficacy (table 18, reference 5)  (18). Critically, lower 
doses were not studied  (18). No common CRS biomarkers such as ferritin or C -reactive 
peptide (CRP) response were included as part of tocilizumab’s FDA filings  (18).  The 
FDA’s own review stated: “It was notable that some patients in the Treated Population 
had resolution of CRS by [CONTACT_4475] 14 after receiving tocilizumab 4 mg/kg, suggesting that a 
dose lower than recommended might be effective”  (18).

At an individual p atient level, utilizing the minimally effective dose of a drug 
(tocilizumab) can optimize efficacy with minimalization of adverse events. On a more 
global scale, t he logic behind a grand strategy for COVID -19 pandemic mitigation efforts 
is to proactively u tilize one rare resource (tocilizumab) to prevent utilization of another, 
more limited resource (ICU -level care), rather than waiting until a patient is already 
committed to the most limited resource (ICU -level care) to  then expend another limited 
resource  (tocilizumab).  The goal of the overarching treatment strategy is to provision 
potentially efficacious therapy to the greatest number of patients likely to benefit from 
tocilizumab while still preserving an adequate supply for critically ill patients  (Figu re 5) 
(12).  
 
 
 
Figure 5. Utilization of low -dose tocilizumab in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], non -critically ill patients with COVID -19 disease

Tocilizumab’s effectiveness in CRS after CAR -T therapy has led to off -label treatment of 
CRS from COVID -19 inf ections with preliminary evidence showing efficacy  (6). 
Unfortunately, as previously stated, tocilizumab  is in limited supply.  In this context, we 
have proposed the development of alternative treatment regimens for supportive care of 
COVID -19 (Figure 5) with the aim of providing therapy for the greatest number of 
patients  likely to benefit . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no n-critically ill patients with COVID -19 with 
and without risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_709901]. Given the much lower IL -6 concentrations in COVID -19 
compared to CRS, we envision that single doses less than 400 mg will be effective  (7, 
19). To date, tocilizumab [ADDRESS_965243] of care dose, representin g a

maximum temperature over the preceding 24 hours) as well as biochemical parameters 
that parall el IL -6 axis -suppression (with focus on C -reactive peptide  (CRP)  measured at 
approximate 24 hours after the initial dose and then daily thereafter) (6). Similar 
approaches may be useful in safely reducing the labeled doses of other IL -6 axis -
suppressing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_709902] -1 antagonists (e.g., anakinra) to more COVID -19-
appropriate doses, thereby [CONTACT_709920].

Group A  patients ). This is a non -trivial, albeit relatively smaller risk of clinical 
decompensation, utilization of ICU -level resources, and COVID -19 disease -related

proportional to this population’s risk.

control study  of patients with rheumatoid arthritis , investigators identified 22 patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis who received tocilizumab 8mg/kg as outpatients in the run -up to 
surgery  (22). Mean time of tocilizumab provisioning prior to surgery was [ADDRESS_965256] -operative days 1 
and 2 that were ap proximately one -half of rheumatoid arthritis control patients not treated 
with tocilizumab  (22). Tocilizumab -treated patients also achieved suppression of the 
post-operative doubling in CRP identified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who did 
not receive tocilizumab  (22). Based on prior pharmacokinetic work and Food and Drug 
Administration re view, t he tocilizumab  drug concentration at this time (16 days following 
administration) in patients treated with tocilizumab is predicted to be  approximately 30 
ug/mL  (23). We infer that t his concentration of  tocilizumab  is sufficient to blunt 
temperature and CRP increases  in times of physiologic stress. The pharmacologically 
implied  one-time dose of tocilizumab needed to achieve a Cmax of 30 ug/mL is between 
50 and 100mg. Given this line of pharmacologic reasoning and tocilizumab’s vial sizes of 
80mg, 200mg, and 400mg, w e therefore propose beginning with a dose of 80mg in Group 
B patients . 
 
1.2.5 Justification for Proposed Changes to Tocilizum ab Dosing  
 
Prior investigations show there is no material difference in the rates of resolution of CRS 
at 14 days, the clinically relevant endpoint, between tocilizumab 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, 
opening the possibility that a significantly lower dose could be u sed, especially given the 
lower levels of IL6 in COVID -19 infection CRS than in CAR -T-related CRS  (18).  
Additional ly, CRS symptoms from CAR -T usually resolved with only 1 or 2 doses of 
tocilizumab (18). Warning signs, then, of in efficacy likely will not become apparent until 
a truly ineffective dose of tocilizumab is reached. De -escalation of the tocilizumab dose 
therefore will be guided by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_709906] 
(1.3.1)  and cautious de -escalation  is warranted. To that end, de -escalation s from cohort to 
cohort will be determined by [CONTACT_1758]’s Operating Committee (discussed in section 5.3) 
and will not exceed 50%. Therefore, if evidence of efficacy of tocilizumab 200mg in the 
first Group A study co hort, the dose may be reduced to a minimum of 100mg in the 
second Group A study cohort. If evidence of efficacy of tocilizumab 100mg in the second 
Group A study cohort, the dose may be reduced to a minimum of 50mg in the third Group 
A study cohort , and so on. The same logic will apply to Group B study cohorts, with a 
starting dose of 80mg (1.2. 3). Given the risks associated with excessive 
immunosuppression in patients with known viral infection, dose increases will be 
approached similarly but with a maximum  cohort -to-cohort increase of 100%: For 
example, if evidence of inefficacy of tocilizumab 200mg in the first Group A study 
cohort, the dose may be increased to a maximum of 400mg in the second Group A study 
cohort. Dosing changes will be  at the discretion of the trial’s Operating Committee 
(discussed in section 5.3 ).

 Endpoints  1.3
1.3.1 The Need for Rapid Endpoints  
 
COVID -19 disease is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_709907]. Anecdotes – but not yet evid ence – abound of 
patients rapi[INVESTIGATOR_709908] , and sometimes days , of clinical 
stability. In a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_709909], the presence of new clinical data points 
including changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters are necessary  to guide clinical 
decisions. By [CONTACT_344231], evaluation of the efficacy of provisioned medications is 
necessary so as to guide clinical and study management. In line with the treatment 
strategy described in 1.2.2 and the behavior of critically ill pati ents with COVID -19 who 
were treated with tocilizumab  (6), as well as given the circumstances of expected  drug 
shortages and a need to make rapid decisions about redosing and dose changes, we 
propose incorporation of [ADDRESS_965257] measurement of IL -6 levels are send -
out labs at the University of Chicago Medicine and therefore cannot be relied upon in the 
clinical context to make judgments about the efficacy of a given dose of tocilizumab.  
 
1.3.2 CRP is correlated with IL -6-axis signaling  
 
Prior literature on serologic markers of inflammation in COVID -19 disease show 
markedly elevated levels of both CRP and IL -6.(7) Cytokines are not frequently obtained 
at the University of Chicago Medicine. Because of turnaround time of > 48 hours (itself 
driven by [CONTACT_094] -analytic variable of having to be sent to a reference laboratory), IL -6 
cannot be directly measured and used as a dynamic measure of tocilizumab activity in 
clinical practice at the University of Chicago Medicine.  
 
Prior work from the immunology literature demonstrates a strong connection between 
CRP elevation and the presence of IL -6 signaling (24), with IL -6-axis signaling serving 
as the predominant inducer of CRP expression (25). In the rheumatoid arthritis disease 
state in which the IL -6 axis is not targeted with therapy, CRP and IL -6 are tightly 
correlated, as well. Though tocilizumab administration is typi[INVESTIGATOR_709910] a  rise in 
serum IL -6 level s (23), CRP declines, suggesting a decrease in IL -6 axis signaling. 
Within the context of COVID -19, IL -6 and CRP are correlated, as wel l (8). 
 
1.3.3 CRP and Fever Briskly Respond to Tocilizumab  in COVID -19 
 
Emerging evidence from the COVID -19 disease literature suggests critically ill patients 
treated with tocilizumab 400mg experience rapid improvement in fever and CRP 
levels (6, 26) .  Based upon our independent evaluation of the data available from the Xu, 
et al  preprint and an estimated CRP half -life of 19 hours ,(27) we infer that 
approximately  85% of critically ill patients with COVID -19 treated with toci lizumab 
400mg would experience either a CRP decline of > 25% or a normalization of CRP to < 
10 ug/mL within 24 hours of dose administration  ((6), reconstituted data are available 
upon request) . Furthermore, all febrile patients with COVID -19 disease who were treated

administration  ((6), reconstituted data are available upon request) On the basis of these 
data and the a bsence of a dose -response relationship  for tocilizumab in CAR -T-related 
CRS (1.2.4) , any effective dose of tocilizumab should have clinical and biochemical 
effects similar to those of the 400mg dose.

 Hypotheses  2.1
 
1. Tocilizumab is effective in decr easing signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence

4 REGISTRATION AND DATA COLLECTION /MANAGEMENT  
 General Guidelines  4.[ADDRESS_965259] numbers of 
potentially eligible patients to investigators (PDR, GWS, B H) using the UCM secure 
paging system (Spok). Information sheets will  be posted in Internal Medicine team rooms 
and in strategic locations of the Emergency Department (determined by [CONTACT_171744])  for nurses 
and physicians .  
 
Before any study -specific evaluations are  performed, all patients must have given written 
informed consent for the study.  Patients must meet all of the eligibility requirements 
listed in Section 3.0.  Eligible patients will be entered on study by [CONTACT_709928] a REDCap database used for both registration and data collection (28). 
 
An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and the informed consent process and a 
member of the study team will complete the reg istration case report form.  
 
 Informed Consent Process  4.2
 
Given the unique nature of the COVID -19 pandemic and the risk for transmission to 
health care and research staff, we will obtain informed consent from possible participants 
by [CONTACT_38733]:  
 
1. Prospective study participants/representatives identified by  [CONTACT_709929] (physical) cop ies of the written informed consent form (ICF) for their 
review from the research team , to be delivered by [CONTACT_709930] . 
ICFs de livered for review will have been signed by [CONTACT_2413].   A patient’s 
representative may alternatively be provided a link to the consent in RedCap.  
2. Phone or video conference will be scheduled between a member of the research 
team and the prospective st udy participant/representative. Research team and 
prospective study participant/representative will discuss the ICF and intent of the 
study as well as risks/benefits to participation.  This conversation will be 
witnessed by [CONTACT_709931]/representative.

the study and is interested in participating, study participant or his/her designated 
representative will sign both copi[INVESTIGATOR_63602] . The witness will sign both copi[INVESTIGATOR_709911].   If the consent is delivered through RedCap, this signature [CONTACT_709947].  
4. The research staff will document the informed consent conversation in the 
electronic medica l record as a Telephone Encounter note in parallel with the 
conversation in an Epic Telephone Encounter created for the purposes of research. 
A standard note form (dot -phrase) will be used for all study participants 
(Appendix A).  
5. At this time, two fully e xecuted ICFs will exist. The study 
participant/representative  will keep one of them in his/her possession as proof of a 
fully executed ICF. The other fully executed ICF  will be bio -bagged in the 
patient’s room and immediately bio -bagged once more upon exit and will be kept 
for filing by [CONTACT_3647].   If the consent process occurred electronically, then 
the fully executed consent will be an electronic file PDF/RedCap do cument.  
 
 Exemption from Investigational New Drug Application  4.3
 
Investigational New Drug (IND) is not required at this time, on the basis of September 
2013 Food and Drug Administration Guidance  (29), section IV.A. This study meets all 
conditions set forth:  
● It studies a drug product, tocilizumab, legally marketed i n the [LOCATION_002].  
● The intent of the study is not to report to FDA a well -controlled study in support 
of label change.  
● The intent of the study is not to support a change in marketing practices.  
● This study focuses on the COVID -19 patient population  who ha ve been admitted 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The mortality for COVID -19 among inpatients is quoted as greater 
than 25%  (1). Though it is a new clinical situation in which to study tocilizumab, 
it is not prohibitively high -risk. Moreover, it does not  represent a prohibitively 
large increase in risk over the baseline risk faced by [CONTACT_709932] . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_709912] -19 pandemic, t ocilizumab 
continues to be administered  at doses nearly an order of magnitude h igher than 
the doses proposed in this study  to patients with rheumatologic conditions such as 
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis. If the risk/benefit calculus of the practice of 
continuing high -dose tocilizumab is acceptable at this time, then this study, with 
its comparable risk/benefit calculus, is as well. Furthermore, an emerging 
standard of care in critical COVID -19 disease is the use of tocilizumab at a dose 
significantly highe r than the dose proposed in this study.  
● The study will be reviewed and conducted under the jurisdiction of an 
Institutional Review Board in accordance with [ADDRESS_965260] 
informed consent as described below, in accordance with 21 CFR part 50.  
● The study is not intended to promote or commercialize tocilizumab.

To complete the registration process, a member of it the study team will:  
 
1.) Assign the patient a study number  (e.g. patient would be UC-001) 
2.) Register the patient on study  
3.) Collect pre -treatment laboratory studies as below  
4.) Assign study participant to Group A or Group B.  
When registering a subject, the following must occur:  
● The patient must have signed the consent form.  
● The date the patient is registered will be considered the patient’s “On Study 
Date.” The patient’s subject ID will be assigned and a confirmation of registration 
will be issued by [CONTACT_709933].   
The University of Chicago will maintain a secure, pas sword protected, and regularly 
backed up REDCap clinical trials database.  All data will be entered into the REDCap 
database.  Data will be stored in RedCap using the patient -study number.

with resultant expectation of drug shortage, and the possibility of unexpected results in 
Re-dose if meets both clinical and biochemical parameters met:
1. Patient would meet clinical parameter if Follow -up-Tmax * > Pre -TCZ Tmax
or
Follow -up-O2-required* > Pre -TCZ O2 required
2. Patient would meet biochemical parameter if Follow -up-CRP†>40mg/L

*Max in 24hours post TCZcompared to Max value in 24hours preTCZand associated with COVID19 per primary team
†Follow up CRP will be >= [ADDRESS_965271] tocilizumab dose and>=24 hours after baseline CRP
#Baseline CRP will be defined according to when results in reference to drug administration as follows: 
∙ If pre -drug CRP was within [ADDRESS_965272] tocilizumab administration, this will be the baseline CRP 
∙ If pre -drug CRP was within [ADDRESS_965273] of 
this study.  
 
The primary role of this committee is to discuss study progress and determine specifics 
for next steps in the study. These are expected to include questions  of study continuation, 
enrollment in the next cohort, and dosing decisions. Prior to initiation of the study, the 
Operating Committee agrees to be bound by [CONTACT_709935]:  
- Size of next cohort  
- Possible increases in doses, which will not increase from o ne cohort to the next by 
[CONTACT_726] 100%  
- Possible decreases in doses, which will generally not decrease from one cohort to 
the next by [CONTACT_726] 50%  
 
The voting members of the Operating  Committee will be Drs . Reid, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1336], Ratain, and 
Strek, with all decisi ons requiring unanimous consent , including enrollment beyond the 
initial [ADDRESS_965274] every two weeks (and likely 
more freq uently). It is mandatory for voting members to be present each time the 
Operating Committee convenes , as a 100% consensus is needed from the voting memb ers 
before a decision is implemented into the next steps for the study.    
 
The Operating  Committee will also be tasked with making decisions about the success or 
failure of a given dose level within a study cohort. The Committee will be guided by [CONTACT_709936] (Figure 5). Success will be 
defined by a low rat e of re -dosing and high rate of clinical and biochemical resolution. 
Metrics will be assessed by [CONTACT_709937].  Decisions will require unanimous consent among the Operating Committee’s 
voting members.  
 
Further enrollment decisions will be made by [CONTACT_20767]’s Operating Committee. Further 
enrollment will be determined by [CONTACT_709938].  
 
The Operating Committee will assess the most up -to-date clinical info rmation for each of 
the enrolled patient and also have the task of altering stratification criteria between group 
A and group B as well as redosing parameters as study continues, only via unanimous 
vote by [CONTACT_709939]-voting members. This 
is to ensure the utmost safety of the patient by [CONTACT_709940]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709913]: allocate patients in appropriate drug dosing group 
(group A versus group B ) and avoid inappropriate red osing.

7 SAFETY  
 Risks  7.1
 
Tocilizumab is a commercially available drug approved for the treatment of diseases 
other than COVID -19. To date, there is no prospective, randomized controlled trial data

                                                                                                                suggesting tocilizumab’s efficacy in COVID -19. There is no standard dose of tocilizu mab 
for COVID -19. The FDA -labeled dose of tocilizumab for CRS is 8 mg/kg. In comparing 
a standard of care dose to reduced dose, there is a risk that the reduced dose will lead to 
poorer clinical outcomes for patients. Patients will be informed of this poss ibility. 
Patients assigned to low -dose tocilizumab blocks may receive an additional dose of 
tocilizumab if there is no evidence of clinical or biochemical improvement.  
 
Side effects and theoretical risks associated with  tocilizumab include:  
- Serious infect ion 
- Gastrointestinal perforation  
- Hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis and death  
- Immunosuppression and increased risk for secondary infection (urinary tract 
infection, bacterial pneumonia, cellulitis, herpes zoster, gastrointestinal infection, 
diverticulitis, septic arthritis, and, rarely, opportunistic infections)  
- Neutropenia  
- Thrombocytopenia  
- Elevated liver enzymes  
- Elevated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  
- Immunogenicity (development of antibodies against tocilizumab)  
- Hepatitis B virus reactivation  
- Rarely, nervous system  problems such as multiple sclerosis.  
- Tocilizumab may increase your risk of cancer  
- Tocilizumab may harm unborn or nursing babies  
Theoretical risks associated with tocilizumab in the context of COVID -19 infection 
include:  
- Suppression of innate antiviral imm unity, resulting in progression of COVID -[ADDRESS_965281]

 Number of ICU Days  8.12
 
Number of ICU days is defined as the time  period when a patient is admitted to the ICU 
(defined as the timestamp on the first vital signs collected in an ICU) until they are 
transferred from the ICU to a non -ICU setting such as a general acute care bed (defined 
as the timestamp on the first vital  signs collected outside an ICU, excepting any “off the 
floor” vital signs charted from operating rooms or procedure or imaging suites).  Death in 
the ICU will be a competing risk.

Version 3.0 16     PR/EMON -101-EHCE  2. BACKGROUND/INTRODUCT ION 
Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide.  Current 
clinical options, while effective, include the choice of monofocal or multifocal lenses .[ADDRESS_440096] monofocal lenses, the patient’s vision is in focus at only one distance 
(near, intermediate, or distance).  Patients implanted with standard mon ofocal lenses 
often require glasses after surgery to improve their near and/or intermediate vision.  
 
 
   
 
   
 
   
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
3. CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
The mean best -corrected distance visual acuity of the TECNIS Eyhance Intr aocular Lens 
group will be non -inferior to that of the control  lens. In addition, the TECNIS Eyhance 
Intraocular lens group will demonstrate better distance -corrected intermediate visual 
acuity compared to the control.  
  
4. STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a 6-mont h, prospective, multicenter, bilateral, randomized subject - and 
evaluator -masked, clinical investigation of the TECNIS Eyhance  IOL versus the TECNIS 
1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_203156].  
  
The study will be conducted at up to 1 5 sites in the U.S.A and will enroll approximately  
220 subjects to achieve approximately 2 00 randomized and bilaterally implanted  
subjects, resulting in approximately 100 evaluable subjects in each lens group at 6

  If a test/exam is 
required by [CONTACT_353513], that test/exam is considered to be study -specific and is not to be 
done until after the informed consent form has been signed by [CONTACT_423].  Following 
the informed consent process, completion of the preoperative study exam and 
determination that the subject meets all of the required entrance c riteria (including lens 
power determination), the subject may be randomized and scheduled for surgery.    
 
As the Informed Consent Form is signed at the beginning of the preoperative study 
exam, some subjects may not qualify after study -specific testing is  performed.  Subjects 
will be considered screen -failures if they do not qualify, or if they qualify but decide not to 
participate further in the study, or if they decide not to proceed with surgery.  These 
subjects will be exited from the study.   
 
Preoper ative testing to be performed for each eye includes the following:

keratometric cylinder (vertical vs. horizontal keratometric readings) between the two time 
points does not exceed 0.[ADDRESS_440115] be no more than ±15○.  If a change 
exceeding these criteria is noted, surgery is to be postponed until keratometric stability is 
demonstrated.  Final biometr y measurements and surgery should not take place until 
keratometric stability is achieved.   
 
Note: if this method of determining corneal stability is not a standard procedure in your 
practice, the subject must sign the informed consent form prior to start ing the stability 
procedure.  
 
IOL POWER AND TARGET ED REFRACTION (EMMETROPIA)  
Axial length and anterior chamber depth (ACD) must be measured to determine the 
appropriate lens power to implant using an A -Constant.

BIOMICROSCOPIC SLIT -LAMP EXAM   
A biomicroscopic slit -lamp exam must be performed at each postoperative visit to 
determine the presence or absence of any medical or lens findings, complications,  or 
adverse events.  IOL decentration and tilt are to be determined subjectively.  The center 
of the lens relative to the pupil can be used to determine IOL decentration.  Note that the 
pupil center may not always be aligned with the visual axis of the eye; therefore, the 
investigator should consider deviations in pupil center from visual axis when  reporting 
IOL decentration.   
Findings of aqueous cells and flare, corneal edema, posterior capsule striae (wrinkles), 
posterior capsular opacification and IOL glistenings are to be rated using standardized 
grading scales of 0 to +4 (0  = none, +4  = severe ) during the slit -lamp biomicroscopy.  
The specific grading scales are provided in Appendix L.

11. ADVERSE EVENTS AND P RODUCT COMPLAINTS  
11.1 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINI TIONS  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is defined (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) as any untoward medical occurrence, 
unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory 
findings) in subjects, users,  or other persons, whether or not related to the study devi ce.  
  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event is considered serious (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) if it is an untoward occurrence 
which may or may not be related to use of the study device that  
• is sight - or life -threatening,  
• results in death,  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] (a planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition without a serious deterioration in 
health is not considered a serious adverse event),  
• results in permanent impairment of a body st ructure or body function,  
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to 
a body structure or function, or

Device -Related Adverse Event/Ad verse Device Effect (ADE)  
A device -related adverse event is defined as any adverse event that is believed to be 
definitely, probably, possibly,  or unlikely to be related to the study device (following the 
guidelines in Section 11.4, Causal Relationship).  A device -related event is also 
considered an adverse device effect (ADE; following ISO [ZIP_CODE]) resulting from the use 
of the study device that may result from user error, insufficiencies,  or inadequacies in the 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation , installation, operation of any malfunction 
of the device.  
   
Anticipated Study -Specific Serious Adverse Events  
The following is a list including, but not limited to, ocular serious adverse events (SAE) 
that are anticipated and must be reported to JJSV fo r this study.  Adverse event 
definitions in accordance with the American Academy of Ophthalmology Task Force 
Consensus Statement .

blepharoplasty and Nd:YAG capsulotomy (for PCO) are not considered adverse events 
for this study.  
 
NOTE 2 : Any adverse event that is immediately sight - or life -threatening will be 
considered serious.  Secondary interventions administered to hasten the resolution of 
such conditions that otherwise will not result in permanent damage will not be reported 
as serious adverse events.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adverse 
Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
Any UADE ([LOCATION_003] 21CFR 812.3(s)) or [LOCATION_003]DE (ISO [ZIP_CODE]) is defined as any serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in  
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan (i.e., this protocol), 
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or risk assessment, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates t o the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.

awareness of the event occurred.  Adverse events are also to be reported to the 
reviewing IRB as per the IRB’s reporting requirements.  If required, adverse events will 
be reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA) according to all applicabl e 
laws and regulations.   
 
Reporting of adverse events shall follow the [LOCATION_003] Code of Federal Regulations 
(21CFR812) for sites in the [LOCATION_003].  General guidelines are provided below:  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
An adverse event that is not serious or device -related  is to be reported to JJSV in a 
timely manner.  Notification of non -serious and non -device related adverse events will 
occur by [CONTACT_32500].  Such adverse events are also to be 
reported to the reviewing IRB per their reporting re quirements.  
  
Complaints/Device Deficiency Reporting  
A general product complaint or device deficiency is to be reported to JJSV in a timely 
manner.  Notification of complaints/device deficiencies will occur by [CONTACT_203186] (e.g., operative visit) and/or by a phone 
call/email  to JJSV.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serious and/or Device -Related Adverse Event Reporting  
 
 
  Any SAE/ADE is to be reported t o 
JJSV by [CONTACT_648], email and/or by [CONTACT_277541]/ADE CRF.  Any SAE or 
device -related AE should also be reported to the investigator’s IRB per their reporting 
requirements.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)/Unanticipated Serious Adver se 
Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) Reporting  
If during the study, a serious adverse event occurs that may reasonably be regarded as 
device -related and was not previously expected in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence, the investigator is to report the UADE/[LOCATION_003] DE to JJSV , and to 

JOHNSON & JOHNSON SURGICAL VISION                                                                                         CONFIDENTIAL

learning of the event for sites in the [LOCATION_003] as required by 21CFR812).  
 
11.4 CA[LOCATION_003]L RELATIONSHIP  
The investigator should always be alert to adv erse events that may be related to the 
study device or the use of the study device (i.e., the procedure specific to the initial 
application of the device).  An attempt should be made in every case to determine the 
causality of the event.  The following def initions are to be used as guidelines in 
determining the relationship between the event and the study device and/or use of the 
device.   
Definitely related:  If the event is associated with the device and/or the use of the 
device beyond a reasonable doubt, a causal relationship exists 
between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the 
study device.  
Probably related:   There is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
between the adverse event and the device and/or the use of the 
study de vice and/or the adverse event cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_5748].  
Possibly related:   The adverse event has not been determined to be related to the 
device or the use of the device, but no other cause has been 
identified and the device and/or the use of the study device 
cannot be ruled out as a possible cause.  
Unlikely to be related:  The possibility of a potential causal relationship between 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the device could 
exist, but the adverse event can be reas onably explained by 
[CONTACT_5748].  
Not related:  There is no possibility of a causal relationship between the 
adverse event and the device and/or the use of the study device 
and/or the adverse event can be attributed to another cause.  
 
If an adverse event i s believed to be definitely, probably,  or possibly related to the study 
device and/or the use of the device, the event will be considered related to the study 
device and/or the use of the device.  
  
11.5 ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOW -UP 
For every adverse event, appropri ate measures should be undertaken to treat and/or 
monitor the subject until resolution occurs.  The subject's files are to include all pertinent 
medical data relating to the event including the subject’s medical records, medical 
reports and/or judgments fr om colleagues or outside specialists who assisted in the 
treatment and follow -up of the subject.

Version 3.0 48     PR/EMON -101-EHCE  POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The general clinical performance of the  TECNIS Eyhance IOL is similar to  that of  the 
TECNIS 1-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_353510]; however, improve ments in  intermediate visual acuity from the slightly  
extended depth of focus may be achieved with the TEC NIS Eyhance IOL.  
 
CONCLUSION  
The hazards/risks associated with the TECNIS Eyhance IOL are acceptable and within 
those of [COMPANY_012] Vision other advanced optic IOLs. The potential clinical 
benefits of the TECNIS Eyhance IOL outweigh the residual ri sks when the device is 
used as intended.

19. TERMINATION OF THE I NVESTIGATION  
The clini cal study will be suspended in the event of high levels of complications and/or 
adverse events that are unexpected in nature and/or severity and evaluated as to 
causality relative to the study device.  The clinical study may be suspended if the 
Medical Mon itor or the IRB, upon review and evaluation of the clinical data, finds 
unacceptable clinical performance or the level of single or total complications and/or 
adverse events unacceptable for continuation of the study . 
 
If causality is shown not to be relat ed to the study device, the study may be resumed in 
accordance with the IRB.  
 
Additionally, the investigator or the Sponsor  may stop a subject’s participation at any 
time.  The Sponsor  may also stop the study at any time for reasons it determines 
appropriate.  However, no suspension of the study would be made to disadvantage the 
study subjects.  Following suspension of the study for any reason, all study subjects who 
have already receiv ed treatment would continue to be followed through completion of the

The primary effectiveness endpoint is the mean monocular best -corrected distance 
visual acuity at 4 m under photopic conditions at 6 months. The non -inferiority 
comparison between the IOL groups will be conducted using the two -sided 90% 
confidence interval  on the mean BCDVA difference based on a t -distribution.  The mean, 
SD, median, minimum, maximum and two -sided 90% C.I. will be presented by [CONTACT_203194]. Note that lower logMAR value is a better acuity and a higher logMAR value is a 
poorer acuity.  The null hypothesis is that the mean difference between the test and 
control IOLs is less than or equal to -0.1 logMAR, with the alternative hypothesis being 
that the mean difference is greater than -0.1 logMAR. A lower bound of the two -sided 
90% confidence interva l will be used for evaluation based on a two -sample t -test 
statistic.   The success criterion is that the lower limit of the two -sided 90% confidence 
interval is above -0.1 logMAR.

Version 3.0 52     PR/EMON -101-EHCE  Safety  Endpoint s 
The Safety Population  will be the primary analysis set for the safety  endpoint s.  Best-
case population will also be  used in the analysis of BCDVA  vs. ISO SPE 
rate.  First-eye data will be the primary anal ysis for safety endpoints.   
 
   
 
• Secondary Surgical Intervention Related to Optical Properties of the IOL  
The counts and percentages of secondary surgical interventions (SSIs) related to optical 
properties of the lens will be reported by [CONTACT_203195].   
 
• SPE Related Adverse Event vs. ISO SPE Rate s 
The counts and percentages of SPE-related adverse events will be repor ted by [CONTACT_203194].  The rate in the test lens group will be compared to the ISO Safety and 
Performance Endpoints (SPE) rates listed in the ISO [ZIP_CODE] -7 using two -sided 90% 
Clopper Pearson Exact confidence interval with no CIs multiplicity adjustment.  Succes s 
criteria is that the lower confidence limit  of the test group is below  the SPE rate. 
 
• Monocular BCDVA vs. ISO SPE Rate  
The count s and percentages of monocular first -eye BCDVA  will 
be presented by [CONTACT_203195].  The rate in the test len s group will be compare d to the ISO 
SPE rate using two -sided 90% Clopper Pearson Exact confidence interval with no CIs 
multiplicity adjustment.  Success criteria is that upper confidence limit  of the test group  is 
higher than the SPE rate . 
 
Other Endpoints : 
The Safety population will be used for the analysis of all other endpoints.  
 
For other visual acuity endpoints, descriptive statistics will be reported for each  IOL 
group  and the difference between IOL group s.  In addition, the count  and proportion of 
eyes/subjects achieving each line will be reported over time by [CONTACT_353519].

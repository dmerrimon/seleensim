Follow-up: [ADDRESS_968629] dose of drug   
The total duration of the study is expected to be 6 months.  
The participant recruitment is expected to be 4.5 months. 
This timeframe is based upon current COVID -19 projections.  Pending 
actual COVID -19 occurrence and participant recruitment, this duration 
may be extended.  
CONCOMITANT 
MEDICATIONS  Allowed: Any, except as noted above in Exclusion Criteria or as deemed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_712098] a proof- of-concept phase II 
clinical trial  
SAFETY  EVALUATIONS  Each participant will have a complete blood cell count with differential 
(CBC), hepatic function panel (LFT) and coagulation panel done. This 
clinical evaluation will measure hemoglobin, platelet count, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio, AST and ALT. 
Wherever possible, tests will be performed on blood drawn for clini cal 
care.

 Participants will be excluded from participating if their hemoglobin is  < 
8 g/deciliter, platelets are < 50,000 / mm3, AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_968630] twice 
each day per institution protocol for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. Participants 
will be excluded from participating in this clinical trial if their systolic 
blood pressure is < 90 mmHg at the time of screening. The medical team will notify the study team if systolic blood pressure is < [ADDRESS_968631] 4 hours apart, and the study 
drug will be held until systolic BP is ≥  [ADDRESS_968632] to determine whether the patient’s participation in the 
study trial should be terminated for the safety of the patient.  
PLANNED  INTERIM  
ANALYSES   Interim data analyses will be performed and study conduct reviewed by 
[CONTACT_712124]:  
1. Safety and futility will be evaluated after approximately 25% and 
50% of participants have completed the study or [ADDRESS_968633] 
occurred (whichever occurs first),  
2. Study conduct will be evaluated after approximately 25% and 50% 
of participants have completed the study, or three months after 
initiation of enrollment (whichever comes first).  
3. Efficacy will be evaluated when 50% of participants have completed 
the study. 
4. A second efficacy analysis will occur for clinical outcomes pursuant 
to the December [ADDRESS_968634] +5%  as 
estimated by [CONTACT_712125].  T he efficacy analysis will use 
the O’Brien -Fleming method to correct for interim analyses .  For the 
futility endpoint, if the lower limit for the 95% con fidence interval of 
the daily change in D-dimer is above 9% at the time of the 50% interim analysis, the trial will be stopped.  The second efficacy endpoint will be 
a hierarchical composite outcome of time to death, days on ventilation, 
change in SpO
2/FiO 2 ratio, and Ordinal scores.  It will be analyzed 
using nonparametric win ratio analysis (Pocock et al., 2012).  Decisions 
regarding the secondary endpoint will be based on conditional power, 
which does not require adjustments for Type I error ( Lan and Trost, 
1999; Siu and Lan, 2001; Lachin , 2006 ). 
Serious adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_414107].

relative change in D -dimer by [CONTACT_6486] a random coefficients regression 
model to log- scale D -dimer levels.   The model will include treatment 
effects, baseline D -dimer levels , and stratification factors (sex and age), 
including treatment interactions with s tratification factors.  
 
The hierarchical composite endpoint  will be analyzed using a win ratio  
algorithm  stratified by [CONTACT_123744].  In a win -ratio analysis, all 
treatment patients are compared pairwise to all control patients, and the 
patient with better outcomes ‘wins’ (as determined by [CONTACT_712126]).  The algorithm results in a ranking of patients 
that are analyzed nonparametrically by a Mann-Whitney U test. 
SAMPLE SIZE RATIONALE Decision thresholds and power are based on a preliminary analysis of 
147 D-dimer measurements taken on 41 COVID-19 patients in the 
University of Michigan hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We used a simulation approach 
matching the patient population characteristics learned from the analysis of p reliminary data reported above.   
For power simulation, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 
set to 0.7, somewhat lower than the observed ICC of 0.77, in order to 
provide a margin for unc ertainty in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690]. Power is based on 
a 13% daily increase in D -dimer levels  for untreated patients, as 
observed in preliminary analysis. We posited a 50% reduction in the growth rate for the 100 mg dose. Using 2 arms with 40 subjects per arm 
(80 subjects in all), power is 0.91 for comparing the pooled 
dipyridamole participants to  the controls.  
At the December 2020 DSMB meeting, it was decided to promote the hierarchical composite endpoint to a primary endpoint.  Sample size for 
this analysis are calculated according to methods presented in Yosef et 
al. (2019).

 1 BACKGROUND - DIPYRIDAMOLE  
 
SARS -CoV-2 infection (COVID- 19) is associated with a thrombophilic state  marked by 
[CONTACT_712127] , neutrophilic infiltration in lungs, and development 
of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( ARDS)1,2. These form a self -amplifying feedback loop 
that results in increased immune activation, coagulation, and refractory respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Currently there are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135297] -19, and treatments under investigation are 
incomplete as they only target specific disease mechanisms (eg. viral replication, individual cytokines, etc.). Treatments that target multiple disease -exacerbating pathways would present 
unique opportunities to augment current clinically available tools for COVID-19.   
Dipyridamole is an FDA -approved drug indicated for use as an antithrombotic agent in 
combination with vitamin K antagonists following cardiac valve replacement, or with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712099] . Two recent studies conducted in China have 
shown that dipyridamole suppresses coronavir al replication in vitro , and may suppress D- dimer 
elevation in a small study of patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_968636] improved clinical outcomes. Dipyridamole increases extracellular adenosine signaling by (1) preventing its reuptake; and (2) stabilizing intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling. Dipyridamole potently reduces replication of the novel coronavirus strain (SARS -CoV- 2) in vitro  with EC50 100 nM ( Figure 1 ), at plasma drug concentrations 
significantly lower than typi[INVESTIGATOR_712100] (1- 4 µM) at the FDA -approved dose
3-5. Among the cytokine families, Type 1 
interferons are the primary drivers of human anti-viral immune responses6. Human and animal 
studies show that dipyridamole induces production of type 1 interferons that are es sential in the 
physiologic antiviral response7,8. Induction of protective type 1 interferons may be an additional 
mechanism by [CONTACT_712128]- viral effects9. Importantly, in a phase I/II 
randomized clinical trial, dipyridamole decreased chronic inflammation in patients with HIV on antiretroviral therapy by [CONTACT_244403] T cell activation and cytokine production
10.

Suppressive  effects of DIP on SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells4 
 
Elevated levels of both D-dimer (indicating thrombophilia) and neutrophils now also appear to 
predict severe disease and worse outcomes in individuals with COVID -1911. D-dimer, a 

Proto col HUM 00179783  Confidential  
 
 
Version #: 6.0  Version Date:  [ADDRESS_968637] of fibrin formation and degradation, is used clinically as a highly sensitive biomarker 
of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and other thrombotic and inflammatory conditions. A recent , small clinical trial of dipyridamole in 31  patients with severe COVID -19 suggested 
potential efficacy of dipyridamole in reducing D- dimer levels  and improving platelet counts
4. 
Our group previously discovered that dipyridamole reduces venous thrombosis in an animal model by [CONTACT_712129] 2A receptor (A
2AR) (Figure 2)12. This adds further support to 
the rationale of this study as VTE is present in up to 40% of patients with COVID-1913. 
Figure 2:  Dipyridamole reduces venous thrombosis in mice treated with human immune -activating (APS) antibodies .
12 
 The acute, exudative phase of ARDS is characterized by [CONTACT_712130]-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, increased neutrophil infiltration and accumulation in the alveoli, and disruption of the alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- capi[INVESTIGATOR_712101] r, which 
leads to increased vascular permeability and e dema14. Neutrophil mediators such as reactive 
oxygen species, proteinases, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are potentially toxic to 
host cells and can result in thrombosis and by[CONTACT_712131].  NETs are extracellular 
tangles of DNA, histones, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by [CONTACT_712132], but which—when not properly regulated —can amplify 
inflammation and venous thrombosis. We have recently found that dipyridamole reduces human neutrophil activation and NET formation ex vivo
12. 
 Severe cases of COVID -[ADDRESS_968638] discovered that dipyridamole inhibits human NET formation
12—a 
critical effector of thrombo -inflammation5 and ARDS1,2. We have recently identified markedly

Version #: 6.0  Version Date:  12 July  2021  Page 16 of 48 
 elevated indicators of NETosis in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 3 A)17. Our data show that the 
degree of NETosis measured in serum correlated with severity of COVID -19 respi[INVESTIGATOR_712102] ( Figure 3B ). We also determined that serum from COVID -19 
patients is capable of inducing NETosis in healthy human neutrophils  (Figure 4 ) suggesting the 
presence of a potentially self -amplifying loop of inflammation and thrombosis. 
 
Figure 3:  Levels of NETs in serum associate with (A) COVID -19 infection and 
(B) COVID -associated mechanical ventilation.17

 Thus, dipyridamole may be beneficial in patients with COVID-19. Given that the majority of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19 develop coagulation dysfunction as indicated by [CONTACT_60643] 
D-dimer
18, and many will also develop ARDS and VTE18, it is critical to better understand the 
appropriate management of patients with COVID-19. 
Participants in this study will be administered dipyridamole or placebo.

 1.1 Non-Clinical Studies Overview  
From FDA-approved USPI [INVESTIGATOR_712103]19 
Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in 
vitro and in vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5- 1.9 μg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which 
acts on the platelet A -receptor thereby [CONTACT_494375] -3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet 
aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). 
Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of 
cAMP -PDE is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic -3',5'-guanosine 
monophosphate-PDE (cGM[COMPANY_003]E), thereby [CONTACT_494376] (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). 
Hemodynamics  
In dogs intraduodenal doses of dipyridamole of 0.5 to 4.0 mg/kg produced dose- related decreases 
in systemic and coronary vascular resistance leading to decreases in systemic blood pressure and 
increases in coronary blood flow. Onset of action was about 24 minutes and effects persisted for about 3 hours. 
Similar effects were observed following intravenous dipyridamole in doses ranging from 0.025 
to 2.0 mg/kg. 
In human s the same qualitative hemodynamic effects have been observed. However, acute 
intravenous administration of dipyridamole may worsen regional myocardial perfusion distal to 
partial occlusion of coronary arteries.  
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism  
Following an oral dose of dipyridamole capsules , the average time to peak concentration is about 
75 minutes. The decline in plasma concentration following a dose of dipyridamole capsules fits a two-compartment model. The alpha half- life (the initial decline following peak concentration) is 
approximately 40 minutes. The beta half- life (the terminal decline in plasma concentration) is 
approximately 10 hours. Dipyridamole is highly bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized in the liver where it is conjugated as a glucuronide and excreted with the bile. 
1.2 Clinical Studies Overview  
From current FDA -approved USPI [INVESTIGATOR_712103]19 
It is believed that platelet reactivity and interaction with prosthetic cardiac valve surfaces, 
resulting in abnormally shortened platelet survival time, is a significant factor in thromboembolic complications occurring in connection with prosthetic heart valve replacement. 
Proto col HUM 00179783  Confidential  
 
 
Version #: 6.0  Version Date:  [ADDRESS_968639] been found to lengthen abnormally shortened platelet survival time in 
a dose- dependent manner.  
In three randomized controlled clinical trials involving 854 patients who had undergone surgical placement of a prosthetic heart valve, dipyridamole tablets, in combination with warfarin, decreased the incidence of postoperative thromboembolic events by 62 to 91 % compared to warfarin treatment alone. The incidence of thromboembolic events in patients receiving the combination of dipyridamole tablets and warfarin ranged from 1.2 to 1.8%. In three additional studies involving 392 patients taking dipyridamole tablets and coumarin-like anticoagulants, the incidence of thromboembolic events ranged from 2.3 to 6.9%. 
In these trials, the coumarin anticoagulant was begun between [ADDRESS_968640] respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  
 Adverse reactions at therapeutic doses are usually minimal and transient. On long- term use of 
dipyridamole tablets, initial side effects usually disappear. The following reactions in Table 1  
were reported in two heart valve replacement trials comparing dipyridamole tablets and warfarin therapy to either warfarin alone or warfarin and placebo.

For patients taking dipyridamole, there is a 2% risk for the development of transient hypotension 
with systolic blood pressure < [ADDRESS_968641].  In 
a small clinical trial, patients with endotoxemia who were randomized to receive dipyridamole

clinical trial will receive 400 mg total daily dose of dipyridamole. The blood pressure of each 
participant will be measured to determine eligibility before randomizing the participants at screening. Patients will be  ineligible for this clinical trial if their systolic blood pressure is less 
than 90 mmHg on two consecutive measurements > [ADDRESS_968642] 4 hours apart, the study team will review the medical recor d to determine whether the patient’s 
participation in the study trial should be terminated for the safety of the patient.   Participants taking dipyridamole may be at higher risk of bleeding complications secondary to its antithrombotic effect. In clinical  studies, dipyridamole did not increase risk of bleeding when 
added to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712104] K antagonists
22,23. Importantly, no excess bleeding was reported in a 
clinical trial with endotoxemic patients randomized to a received randomized clinical trial of 
dipyridamole in endotoxemia using the maximum recommended daily dose recommended by [CONTACT_1622] 
21. Medical records will be reviewed daily for ISTH -defined major bleeding.  
For participants taking dipyridamole, there is a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_712105], vomiting, flushing and pruritus. In addition, angina pectoris has been reported rarely  and there have been rare reports of liver dysfunction. As per the 
USPI, on those uncommon occasions when adverse reactions have been persistent or intolerable, they have ceased on withdrawal of the medication. 
In post-marketing reporting experience, there have been rare reports of hypersensitivity reactions 
(such  as rash, urticaria, severe bronchospasm, and angioedema), larynx edema, fatigue, malaise, 
myalgia,  arthritis, nausea, dyspepsia, paresthesia, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, alopecia,

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a proof-of- concept , single- center, single-blinded, placebo -controlled, randomized, 14- day 
trial. Participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be offered 
the opportunity to complete the study.  
We plan to enroll 160 participants . If an interested patient is eligible for  this study, the 
participant will begin a 14 -day treatment period when they will be administered a study drug or 
placebo control for 14 days.  Participants will be assigned to receive the treatments in a stratified, random blocks based on sex 
and age (above/below 65).Stratified blocks were generated using the ‘blockrand’ package in R. Clinical evaluations will be made daily. If lab studies from any of these days are abnormal to a clinically significant extent, the study investigator will further evaluate wh ether the abnormality 
is attributed to the study drug. 
Total treatment of participant is planned for [ADDRESS_968645] dose of study drug. Total duration of the study is expected to be 6 months. Study Schematic is in Figure 5.

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
participant administered a pharmaceutical p roduct and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the current protocol or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the infor mation in the 
protocol. 
The Investigator or designee will probe, via medical record review, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each study day for the duration of study drug administration, and record the information in the source documents.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.

Version #: 6.0  Version Date:  12 July  2021  Page 36 of 48 
 11.2 AE Severity  
The guidelines shown in below Table 2  should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily 
serious. 
Table 2:  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical intervention or 
therapy required. The participant may be aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The participant is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it occurred.

13 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS 
A protocol violation occurs when the participant, study coordinator or the i nvestigator fails to 
adhere to significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, participant safety 
and primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Use of a prohibited concomitant medication  
 
• Non-compliance with study drug regimen  
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol violation. The National  Investigator in consultation with IND Sponsor w ill determine if a 
protocol violation will result in withdrawal of a participant.  
When a protocol deviation occurs, a protocol deviation form detailing the deviation will be completed.  A copy of the form will be filed in the study’s regulatory binder.

to conduct and review an interim analysis, and to ensure the continued scientific validity and merit of the study. The DSMB has been formed and includes experts in clinical trials, statistics, thrombosis, and pharmacology. A Charter has been written to guide the DSMB’s activities. There will be at  least two interim review(s) conducted b y the DSMB for the purpose of 
monitoring study conduct and assessing participant safety. Study conduct will be evaluated by [CONTACT_712141] 25% and 50% of participants have completed the study, or three months after initiation of enrollment (whichever comes first). When approximately 25% and 50% of participants have completed the study or [ADDRESS_968678] occurred (whichever occurs first), an interim data analysis to evaluate safety and futility will be conducted by [CONTACT_82571].  The interim analyses for efficacy will be limited to the review after 
50% of p articipants have completed the study to limit the cost to power from multiple interim 
analyses.   
Further details regarding the timing and content of the interim reviews is included in the statistical section below.  
15 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be 
written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan described below.   
15.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
Analy ses will follow a modified  intent to treat ( mITT) paradigm.  All eligible participants  who 
are randomized into the study and receive at least one dose of the study drug will be included in 
the analysis.  
Based on interim analysis for futility, it was decide d to halt recruitment beginning January 19
th, 
2021.  The final data analysis will begin:  
• after all [ADDRESS_968679] drug follow-up has been completed for all randomized patients, 
• after chart review and data cleaning are complete, and  
• after approval of the SAP by [CONTACT_3476]. 
 
15.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
The following demographic variables at enrollment will be recorded: race, ethnicity , sex, date of 
birth , height and weight.

for each treatment arm, and a random intercept and random slope for each subject. The model will also include treatment interactions by [CONTACT_245632] (sex and age).  The prima ry 
hypothesis is that the treatment arm will have a smaller fixed slope than the control arm, indicating that treated subjects’ D -dimer levels either increase more slowly or decrease relative 
to those of the control subjects.    Mixed effects regression makes use of all available information for each subject -- even a subject with a single D -dimer measurement can be included.  This technique efficiently makes use of the 
partial or full data observed from each subject, implicitly weighting subjects more if they have more observed points.  We note that subjects who do well and are discharged relatively earlier will be somewhat down-weighted due to having fewer measurements, but this is appropriate since our primary aim is to assess moderation of D- dimer increase in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   Discharge and 
other outcomes are discussed below as secondary aims.  We also note that this approach quantifies the change in D- dimer as a linear trend on the log scale.   Our preliminary analysis of 
D-dimer levels in patients with COVID -19 supports this simple approach to quantifying D- dimer 
variation.  Although D- dimer can fluctuate from day -to-day, the longer- term trend is primarily 
linear, but we acknowledge that some patients may exhibit other patterns of change.  The second primary endpoint is a hierarchical composite of:  
• Time of death from any cause during study duration 
• Number of days on mechanical ventilation during study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Decrease in SpO
2/FiO [ADDRESS_968682] 50 units relative to baseline at any time during the 
observation period, and  
• The cumulative sum of COVID ordinal scores during study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
The composite endpoint will be nonparametrically assessed by [CONTACT_712142]24 across pairs of patients and evaluating a ‘win ratio’ using the Mann -Whitney U 
statistic.   Each pair consisting of one treated and one untreated subject is ranked as defined 
below:  
1. If both subjects die, then the subject who lives longer wins.  
2. If exactly one subject dies, then the subject who does not die wins.    
3. If the subjects are tied after step 2 (neither subject dies), then the subject with fewer days on 
ventilator wins.  
4. If the subjects are tied after step 3, and only one of the subjects has a decrease in SpO2 of [ADDRESS_968683] the decrease in SpO2 wins.

0.67 win proportion. For the efficacy endpoint using the O’Brien-Fleming method to correct for interim analyses, we will use  a P value cutoff of 0.[ADDRESS_968685] point analysis and 0.044 
for the final analysis, yielding an overall alpha (type I error rate) of 0.05.   
15.3.1  Interim Analyses of Primary  Endpoint s 
When approximately 25% and 50% of participants have completed the study or [ADDRESS_968686] occurred (whichever occurs first), an interim analysis for safety and futility will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_4318]. The interim analyses for efficacy will be limited to the review after 50% of participants have completed the study to limit the cost to power from multiple interim analyses.  
The interim analysis of benefit for the primary endpoint will be conducted on a binary version of patient -level D -dimer change rates.  Rates will be estimated separately for each patient by [CONTACT_712143] a 5% daily increase.  Treatment groups will be compared by a Fisher’s exact test.  We will use the O’Brien- Fleming 
method and Lan- DeMets alpha spendi ng functions to preserve an overall Type I error rate of 
0.05.  Thus, the interim analysis will use a significance threshold of 𝛼𝛼= 0.006 (based on 45 
patients), and the remaining 0.044 of alpha will be divided evenly between the final analyses of the two primary endpoints. 
For futility of the D- dimer endpoint, if the lower limit for the 95% confidence interval of the 
daily change in D-dimer is above 9% for the dipyridamole population at  the time of the 50% 
interim analysis, the trial will be stopped.  It wa s decided in the December [ADDRESS_968687] (1999) and advanced in Siu and Lan (2001) and Lachin (2006).  This approach calculates the condition power (CP), defined as the probability of finding a significant result at the end of the study given the interim results and a presumption that the data reflect the true effect size.  Decision thresholds are predetermined as:  
• CP ≥  0.9 : Stop study for benefit 
• 0.8 ≤  CP < 0.9 : Continue study to planned N = 127 
• 0.3 ≤  CP < 0. 8 : Continue study to with  re-estimated sample size not to exceed 160  
• CP < 0. 3 : Stop study for futility

mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal oxygen, vasopressor therapy, ECMO support, or COVID-
related dialysis, and  
• Death at any time is assigned a value of 0 days. 
o Analysis: Mann -Whitney U -Test (nonparametric)  
Each analysis will include interactions of the study drug by [CONTACT_245632].   
15.5 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints 
The DICER study contains four major kinds of exploratory endpoints (listed in Section 3.5): 
continuous, change over time (continuous), binary, and time to event.  All analyses will be based on the mITT population except where specified in the definition of the endpoint.   
We will analyze continuous endpoints by [CONTACT_712144] (sex 
and age) as predictors.  
We will analyze co ntinuous change over time endpoints by [CONTACT_712145] 10.1 for the D -dimer primary effica cy endpoint. 
We will analyze binary endpoints by [CONTACT_712146] (sex and age) as predictors.  
We will analyze time -to-event by [CONTACT_712147] (sex and age) as predictors.  
 In all analyses, the only estimate of interest will be the difference between treatment arms.  We will include treatment interactions by [CONTACT_712148] s, and we will fit separate 
models where age is continuous versus where age i s represented by [CONTACT_712149] 
≥ 65 years . Hypothesis tests will be two -sided. 
15.6 Power analysis 
Decision thresholds and power are based on a preliminary analysis of 147 D- dimer 
measurements taken on 41 COVID -19 patients admitted to Michigan Medicine .  Using variance

Version #: 6.0  Version Date:  12 July  2021  Page 43 of 48 
 components regression on log- transformed D -dimer levels, we found that the intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) for participants (between -participant variance to total variance) was 
0.77 in a model controlling for days since admission and ICU status (binary) as fixed effects. 
ICU status serves as a proxy for case severity. An increasing trend in D- dimer levels (~13% per 
day) was common to both groups. The moderately high ICC reflects the contributions of around 
90% within- participant variation (day -to-day) relative to around 300% between- participant 
variation. Thus, D- dimer levels largely behave as a stable participant -level trait that may indicate 
the underlying extent of disease. Defining the endpoint in terms of the least squares slope of D-dimer level using up to [ADDRESS_968690] of daily D-dimer fluctuations and thereby [CONTACT_712150].  
To assess power for the proposed design, we used a simulation approach matching the patient population characteristics learned from the analysis of preliminary data reported above.  For power simulation, the ICC was set to 0.7, somewhat lower than the observed ICC of 0.77, in order to provide a margin for unc ertainty in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3690]. Power is based on a 13% daily 
increase in D -dimer levels for untreated participants, as observed in preliminary analysis. We 
posited a 50% reduction in the gr owth rate for th e 100 mg dose. Using 2 arms with 40 
participants per arm ( 100 participants in all), power is 0.[ADDRESS_968691] of care treatment has changed with 
introduction of anti- inflammator y steroids which suggests an increase in sample size may be 
necessary to complete the study.

We will enroll 100 participants to complete this study based on the power calculation. Patients 
will be recruited for this study and randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_968692] all observations and other pertinent data for each participant treated with the study drug.   
Study personnel will enter data from source documents corres ponding to a participant’s visit into 
secured, central databases . Participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_712151] a participant

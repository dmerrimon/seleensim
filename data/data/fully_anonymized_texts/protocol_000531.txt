Study Product(s), Dose, 
Route, Regimen  Nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg IV every 3 
weeks for up to 4 doses (12 weeks)-Cohort A and B 
 Nivolumab (480 mg/dose IV every 4 weeks) for up to 92 
weeks or until progression in follow-up-Cohort A and B 
 Nivolumab (480 mg/dose IV every 4 weeks) for up to 104 
weeks or until progression in follow-up-Cohort C 
 Total of up to 104 weeks therapy- Cohort A, B, and C 
 
 
Duration of Administration Up to a total of 104 weeks of study treatment and 24 months of follow up in all Cohorts. 
Statistical Methodology A Mini-Max Simon Two-Stage design will be used to 
assess ORR defined as a 50% decline in PSA from 
baseline in CDK12 loss of function metastatic CRPC patients. It is assumed that an ORR of 30% or more 
would be interesting for further study compared to a 
reference ORR of 10% based on the KEYNOTE-199 
trial [35] [1]. Accrual of 25 patients will provide 80% 
power to detect this difference in ORR with a type I error of 5%. Interim analysis will be completed after 15
 
patients (Cohort A only). If [ADDRESS_45865] a PSA
 response, then the treatment will be 
 
Page 8 of 52   
  recommended for further study in this population.  No 
interim analysis is planned for Cohort C. 
 
Cohort B will accrue 15 patients with non-prostate histology. A reference ORR of 5% is assumed in 
patients with non-prostate hi stology. With [ADDRESS_45866] 76% power to detect an ORR of 25% with a 
one-sided type I error of 5%. If 3 or more responses 
are seen in cohort B, then we will conclude that there is 
preliminary evidence of activity. A total trial population 
of 65 subjects is planned. 
 
 
Page 9 of 52  1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Disease Background 
Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate canc er (mCRPC) remains a challenging disease, 
with incremental resistance to multiple li nes of therapy over time. However, greater 
understanding of the mutational landscape of mCRPC is providing more treatment 
options for advanced prostate cancer. Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of a large multi-site cohort of patients with mCRPC performed by [CONTACT_43879] s, including BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM [1], 
and has provided the rationale for the clinical  use of PARP inhibitors. However, one of 
the novel genomic aberrations in mCRPC demonstrated in our tumor genome 
sequencing initiative is the loss of CDK12 function [1] [2].  
 CDK12: 
 
 Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have an impo rtant role in cell cycle regulation in 
conjunction with cyclin. Some cyclin-speci fic kinases function in gene transcription 
control, including CDK12 and CDK13, which ar e associated with cyclin K and have a role 
in regulating transcription elongation and RNA  splicing. In an evaluation of CDK12 gene 
modification prevalence across various tu mor types, there was a 1.08% mutation rate 
across 1203 prostate cancer samples, compared with 2.3% in 915 ovarian cancer samples [3]. In another recent analysis, the pr evalence of CDK12 mutation in metastatic 
prostate cancer was found to be as high as 5-6%, as shown in Figure 1 [4]. Impairing CDK12 function in ovarian cancer cells decreases BCRA1 levels and disrupt homologous recombination repair, leading to reported in creased sensitivity to cisplatin and PARP 
inhibition [5]. In addition to an association with non-functional homologous recombination (HR) repair, tumors with inactivated CDK [ADDRESS_45867] markedly 
increased genomic copy number. 15 of these 17 cases also harbored CDK12 mutations, 
Figure 1 Tepley et al. Treatment strategies for DNA repair-deficient prostate cancer. 
Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2017 Aug; 10(8):889-898.  
 
Page 10 of 52  the majority of which were deleterious [6 ]. Mutations in CDK12 are shown to cause 
downregulation of genes in the HR pathway, disabling repair of double-strand DNA 
breaks and leading to tumor genomic instability [7 ]. The work in the Michigan Center for 
Translational Pathology (MCTP) has recently  identified a novel genetically unstable 
subset of prostate cancer typi[INVESTIGATOR_43800]12. CDK12-mutants are 
genomically, transcriptionally, and phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_43801] (MMR) deficient tumors. CDK12 deficient CRPC 
tumors display a large number of gene fusions (Figure 1A, unpublished). Further, CDK12-mutant tumors exhibit a higher neoantigen burden than mCRPC in general (Figure 1B, unpublished). These attributes of  the CDK12-mutant tumors could potentially 
be exploited clinically as tumor mutatio nal burden and higher neoantigen load generally 
correlate with response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy [8, 9].
 
 
 
 
 
  
MiOncoSeq-Directed Patient Selection: 
To effectively conduct clinical studies targeting patients with CDK12 aberrations, rapid and accurate tumor sequencing to identify patients harboring this defect is needed. [CONTACT_43913]’s lab has unparalleled expertise and experience for accomplishing this task, 
including on the Stand Up 2 Cancer (SU2C) East Coast Dream Team. The MCTP, which [CONTACT_43913] directs, also has extensive ex perience with correlative studies associated 
with tumor specimens and in the context of clinical trials. The Oncoseq1700 assay is a 
hybrid capture approach that currently interrogates 1733 genes in tumor DNA and 
germline DNA as well as RNA capture transcrip tome of the tumor. Over 500X cover of 
the tumor and matched normal is achieved, and is compatible with formalin fixed or frozen samples obtained by [CONTACT_43880]. The Oncoseq assay is run in the 
MCTP’s CLIA/CAP laboratory, with results provided as a report within 2-3 weeks. The Oncoseq approach can successfully identify sub-clones that comprise 2% or less of 
tumor cells as well as clinical biopsies with as little as 5% tumor content. By [CONTACT_43881], we complement DNA-based mutational and copy 
number analyses with a functional read-out that highlights outlier expression and gene 
fusions. The composition of the 1733 gene panel begins with the 300-350 genes known to be recurrently mutated in a variety of cancers which form components of targeted 
cancer gene panels currently in use (e.g., FoundationOne). Our emphasis on sequencing 
matched normal allows the Oncoseq assay to  make clear-cut germline calls which can 
often be useful to the family or have t herapeutic implications (e.g., DNA repair gene 
defects and hypermutation/mismatch repair).   
Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer: 
It has now been established that tumor mutational load and increased pathologic 
mutation rate correlate with a higher clinical  benefit rate with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockade [8], and also correlate with prolonged overall survival with 
Fig. 1 A. Types of Genomic Aberrations in 
CDK12 mutant CRPC Fig. 1 B. Neoantigen load among 
various DNA defective CRPC tumors 
 
Page 11 of 52  immunotherapy [9]. In prostate cancer, however, prior studies evaluating the use of 
immunotherapy have been largely disappointing.  In a phase I study of 39 patients treated 
with nivolumab anti-PD monotherapy, none of the 9 CRPC patients responded [10]. A 
recently published phase III study randomizing over 400 meta static prostate cancer 
patients without visceral metastases to ip ilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks versus 
placebo followed by [CONTACT_43882] [11]. 
However, a recent phase II study showed early response to PDL-[ADDRESS_45868] ten patients enrolled 
demonstrating rapid and deep PSA declines to ≤ 0.2 ng/ml. In one patient, this 
impressive response was associated with tumor microsatellite instability [12], and a similar response was reported in a patient with loss of function in MSH2 and MSH6 [13]. 
Aside from rare patients harboring mismatch repair mutations, there are some prostate 
cancer patients who have demonstrated response to immunotherapy where an 
underlying driver of response has not yet been identified. This inconsistent clinical 
response to immunotherapy suggests that  the underlying tumor characteristics in 
prostate cancer that portend response to  immunotherapy have not yet been identified. 
Clinically validated biomarkers for predicting response to immunotherapy have not yet been established, and greater understanding of ad ditional drivers of response to these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_43802]. Combination therapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43803] [14] and is  now also being evaluated in small cell lung 
cancer [15]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_43804] a two-drug regimen, a 
recent meta-analysis evaluating immunotherapy in melanoma and lung cancer demonstrated improved PFS, OS, and ORR rates with combination therapy compared 
with monotherapy [16]. 
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities 
Nivolumab: 
The clinical use of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor and selectively inhibits PD-1 has been well-
established across multiple cancer types. Through inhibition of the PD-1/PDL-[ADDRESS_45869] common adverse reactions (in ≥20% of patients) with nivolumab 
as a single agent include fatigue, rash, muscul oskeletal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, 
asthenia, cough, dyspnea, constipation, decreased appetite, back pain, arthralgia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], and pyrexia.  Most commonly documented adverse reactions of 
nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43805], rash, diarrhea, nausea, 
pyrexia, vomiting, and dyspnea.     
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: 
Clinical use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a human CTLA-4-blo cking antibody is approved for treatment 
of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and for adjuvant treatment of patients with 
cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement  of regional lymph nodes. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43806] a dose of 3 mg/kg for unresectable or metastatic melanoma and at 10 mg/kg 
for adjuvant therapy in melanoma. The most common adverse reactions (in ≥5% of 
patients) are fatigue, diarrhea, pruritus, rash, and colitis. Additional common adverse 
reactions at the 10 mg/kg dose (≥ 5%) include nausea, vomiting, headache, weight loss, 
pyrexia, decreased appetite, and insomnia.  
 
Page 12 of 52  1.3 Rationale 
In this study, we seek to assess the effica cy of immunotherapy in patients with CDK12 
mutations in metastatic prostate cancer pat ients, and in other tumor histologies with 
CDK12 alterations. Increasing data has shown a correlation between response to 
immunotherapy and loss of normal DNA repai r mechanisms [17] [18]. However, as 
previously discussed, CDK12 aberrations appear  to be concordant with increased tumor 
genomic instability, suggesting a potentially robust response to immunotherapy not 
directly related to changes in DNA repair pathways. Combination immunotherapy has 
been shown to be associated with an improved response rate compared with single-agent therapy, and given the absence of identifiable benefit with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43807], combination t herapy with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43808] a 
susceptible patient population may be associat ed with higher response rates. However, 
we hypothesize that CDK12 alterations would also result a baseline increased likelihood 
of response to immunotherapy. A robust treat ment response with single-agent therapy 
may be seen in this highly selected population, while a therapeutic response was not 
previously captured in an unselected me tastatic prostate cancer population.  
 
We therefore propose a phase II study of nivolumab and ip ilimumab combination therapy 
followed by [CONTACT_43883] l east one standard therapy (cohort A). Other 
advanced metastatic cancers with CDK12 changes, including ovarian cancer, would also 
be included (cohort B). Maintenance nivolumab at a flat dose of 480 mg IV given every 4 
weeks will be continued until total protocol  therapy of up to 104 weeks of therapy. 
Nivolumab at a flat dose of 480 mg IV given every 4 weeks will be continued until total 
protocol therapy of up to 104 weeks of therapy in Cohort C for prostate cancer patients. 
1.4 Exploratory Studies
 
1.4.1 Mi-ONCOSEQ 
We will sequence patients under our established Mi-ONCOSEQ [19] study, which 
is an effort to use integrative clinical sequencing towards personalized medicine for cancer patients. The matched tumor-normal library from WXS (whole exome 
sequencing) along with strand specific a ll-exon captured library from total RNA 
(captured transcriptome) will be sequenc ed at our CLIA certified sequencing 
laboratory. 
1.4.2 Immune infiltration 
To date, a definite correlation betw een response to immunotherapy and tumor 
cell or immune-infiltrating PD-L1 expression has not been established. We seek 
to profile immune infiltration in tumor biopsies in both patient cohorts.

Patient registration for this trial will be centrally managed by [CONTACT_43886]:  
A potential study subject who has been screened for the trial and who has signed the Informed Consent document will be initially documented by  [CONTACT_43887] a Screening and 
Enrollment Log.  
 
It is the responsibility of the local site investigator to determine patient eligibility prior to submitting 
patient registration request to the Coordinat ing Center. After patient eligibility has been 
determined, a copy of the completed Eligibility Worksheet together with all the pertinent de-
identified source documents will be submitted by t he requesting site to the Coordinating Center, 
by [CONTACT_20143] [EMAIL_825].  
 The Multi-Site Coordinator (MSC) of the Coordinating Center will review the submitted documents 
and process the registration. Sites should inform  the Multi-Site Coordinator of a potential 
registration by [ADDRESS_45881] start within  14 business days of enrollment to the study. 
 
5.1.1  In this study, Cohort A and Cohort B pat ients will start treatment with nivolumab 
dosed at 3 mg/kg IV and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses. 
Cohort C patients will receive immunotherapy with nivolumab dosed at a flat 
dose of 480 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 26 doses or 104 weeks.

5.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
Any patient who receives treatment on this pr otocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of  toxicity according to the Time and Events 
Table (Section 6.1). Toxicity will be assess ed according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Dose changes of either study drug is 
NOT permitted. Doses can be held however as necessary. Dosing holds should be made 
according to the system showing t he greatest degree of toxicity.  
 
Adverse Event Related vs Unrelated Dose Delays: If dose delay is due to an unrelated 
Adverse Event then reason for hold must be do cumented. Any patient on this protocol will 
be allowed to continue to receive study treat ment at the investigator’s discretion, 
regardless of AE relatedness. Do not have to delay dose for unrelated Adverse Event.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Other:  For rare cases of myotoxicity (myositis, myocarditis, and rhabdomyolysis), some with fatal outcome, have been reported with nivolumab or nivolumab in combi nation with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If a patient develops signs 
and symptoms of myotoxicity, close monitoring s hould be implemented, and the patient referred to a 
specialist for assessment and treatment without delay. Based on severity of myotoxicity, nivolumab or 
nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43836], and appropriate treatment 
instituted.  
 
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during 
the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically 
prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The 
investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Study PI. The final decision on 
any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with  the investigator and/or the subject's primary 
physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy or vaccination schedule 
requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the Sponsor-Investigator and the subject. 
  
Use of bisphosphonates/RANKL inhibitors are st andard in CRPC and are allowed on the study. 
Starting bisphosphonates if indicated is allowed while on study.  
 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the follo wing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_43837]:  
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy except for ongoing androgen 
deprivation therapy (e.g. with LHRH agonist/antagonist)  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol 
 Investigational agents other than chec kpoint inhibitor immunotherapy  
 5 α-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride) 
 Any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g . Saw Palmetto and PC-SPES) 
 Neulasta®  
 Radiation therapy  
 Local intervention is discouraged unless medi cally unavoidable. Radiation therapy to a 
symptomatic solitary lesion/area may be considered on a case-by-case basis after consultation with the Principal Investigator (except during screening). Subjects receiving local 
intervention (e.g., palliative radiation) are allowed to continue to receive study treatment at 
the investigator’s discretion. Subjects who re ceive local intervention may be considered not 
evaluable (and may be assigned a conservative censoring or progression date).  
 Live vaccines within 30 days prior registration and while participating the trial. Examples of 
live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, intranasal in fluenza, rabies, BCG (tuberculosis vaccine), and 
typhoid vaccine. If precluded by [CONTACT_427], live vaccines should not be given for [ADDRESS_45898] dose of checkpoint i nhibitor immunotherapy is administered.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive drugs for any purpose other than to 
modulate symptoms from a drug-related AE of immunologic etiology (refer to Section 5.2 – 
 
Page 27 of 52  Dose Modification). The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after 
consultation with the Study PI.  
o Use of prophylactic corticosteroids to avoid allergic and other adverse reactions (e.g., to 
IV contrast dye or tran sfusions) is permitted. 
 
o Use of intermittent inhaled steroids or local injection of corticosteroids into joints is 
permitted upon consultation with the Study PI. 
 
o Physiologic doses of prednisone ≤ 10 mg (or equivalent) per day. 
5.4 Duration of Therapy 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adv erse events, treatment may continue for a 
total of 104 weeks in all from the start of study  therapy or until one of the following criteria 
apply: 
 Disease progression as defined in Section 7.0 
 Inter-current illness t hat prevents further administration of treatment 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
 Patient voluntarily wi thdraws from treatment  
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator 
 
Do not hold scans, continue scan schedule every [ADDRESS_45899], or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative 
reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation from study or study drug therapy will be 
documented and may include : 
 
Page 28 of 52  5.7.1 Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow-up); 
5.7.2 Loss of ability to freely provide cons ent through imprisonment or involuntary 
incarceration for treatment; 
5.7.3 Patient is unable to comply with protocol requirements; 
5.7.4 Treating physician determines continuation on the study would not be in the 
patient’s best interest; 
5.7.5 Patient becomes pregnant (pregnancy to be reported along same timelines as a 
serious adverse event); study patient will undergo the EOT visit and follow-up 
visits excluding tumor biopsy according to the activities in this protocol and study 
procedure assessments.

confirmed by a second value 4 or more week s later, confirming a rising trend. If there 
is no initial decline from base line, PSA progression is defined as ≥ 25% increase and

Page 31 of 52   
7.1.3   Duration of Response 
 Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met fo r PSA response until the first date that 
PSA progression is documented, or if ther e is interval devel opment of recurrent 
or progressive disease objectively documented by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria.  
7.1.4 Progression-Free Survival 
PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) is defined as the duration of time from 
start of treatment to time of PSA progres sion as defined above in  section 7.1.[ADDRESS_45910] PSA measurement date. 
 
Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS ) is defined as the duration of time 
from start of treatment to time of r adiographic progression as defined above in 
section 7.1.[ADDRESS_45911] 
radiographic scan date.  Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of first PCWG3 defi ned progression or death, the event that 
occurs first. Patients who have not exper ienced either event at the time of 
analysis will be censored at the date of their last progression assessment. 
 
 7.1.5 Radiographic Response Criteria   
 
All radiographic response criteria are as per PCWG3 criteria summarized below. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Nodal Disease 
Up to five (5) lesions are recorded per site of disease. These will be 
assessed as per RECIST 1.1 with  the following PCWG3 caveats: 
 
1. Changes in size are recorded using a waterfall plot 
2. Favorable change is confirmed with a second scan 3. Complete elimination of disease at any site is recorded 
separately 

 
Page 32 of 52  4. Only changes in lymph nodes that were ≥1.5 cm in the short axis 
are reported 
5. Changes in pelvic (regional) nodes versus extrapelvic 
(distant/metastatic) nodes are recorded separately 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Visceral Disease 
Visceral disease includes lesions in lung, liver, adrenal, and CNS sites. 
These will be assessed as per RECIST  1.1 with the following PCWG3 
caveats:  
1. Changes in liver, lung, adr enal, and CNS sites are recorded 
separately. 
2. Only changes in lesions ≥1.[ADDRESS_45912] dimension are 
reported 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Bone Disease 
Bone disease is evaluated as per PCWG3 criteria, with changes recorded as improved or stable (no new lesions) or worse (new lesions). Additional PCWG3 caveats include: 
 
1. Changes in intensity of uptake alone do not constitute 
progression or regression 
2. No new lesions: continue ther apy in absence of other signs of 
progression 
3. New lesions (progression) is defined by [CONTACT_43889]3: 
a. Exclude pseudoprogression in  the absence of symptoms 
or other signs of progression 
b. At least two new lesions on first post-treatment scan, 
with at least two additional lesions on the next scan (2+2 rule) 
c. If at least two additional new lesions are seen on the 
next (confirmatory) scan, the date of progression is the 
date of the first post-treatm ent scan, when the first two 
new lesions were documented 
d. For scans after the first post -treatment scan, at least two 
new lesions relative to the first post-treatment scan 
confirmed on a subsequent scan 
 
7.[ADDRESS_45913]- Non-Prostate Malignancies 
  (For Cohort B only)  
 
For patients with metastatic non-prostate cancer and measurable disease, response and 
progression will be evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_43890] (RECIST) Committee [34].  Changes in 
only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_45914] (irRECIST) utilizes RECISTv1.1 
but considers an inflammatory response (or “pseudo-progression”) as normal. The main 
difference between RECISTv1.[ADDRESS_45915] progressive disease (PD) assessment (as per RECISTv1.1) if using immune-related 
 
Page [ADDRESS_45916] criteria. This PD per RECISTv1.1 is then re-labeled as immune related stable 
disease (irSD) per irRECIST and requires additi on of unidimensional measurements of all 
new lesions (that meet the definition of target lesion) to be added to the sum of longest 
diameters (SLD) calculation for response  assessment. Importantly, immune-related 
progression (irPD) must be confirmed by a follow-up scan at least 4 weeks (within 4-8 weeks) following the initial PD/i rSD assessment in order to take the patient off the trial. 
 
Subjects that are deemed to have clinical progression and unstable should not be 
continued on therapy after PD (per RECIST v1.1) and are therefore not required to have 
repeat tumor imaging for confirmation as per ir PD definition. It is at the discretion of the 
site investigator whether to continue a su bject on study treatment until repeat imaging is 
obtained. This clinical judgment decision by [CONTACT_43891]’s overall clinical condition, includi ng performance status, clinical symptoms, and 
laboratory data. 
 Treatment Beyond Progression  
 Accumulating evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with 
immunotherapy may derive clinical benef it despi[INVESTIGATOR_43840]. 
 
Subjects treated will be permitted to continue study 
treatment beyond initial RECISTv1 .1 defined PD, assessed by [CONTACT_1275], as long as they meet the following criteria: 
 
 Investigator determined clinical benefit 
 Tolerance of study drug 
 Stable performance status 
 Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent 
serious complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases) 
 
  A radiographic assessment/ scan should be performed within 4-8 weeks 
  of initial investigator-assessed progression to determine whether there 
  has been a decrease in the tumor size or continued PD (termed irPD).   The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by [CONTACT_43892].   If the investigator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical 
benefit by [CONTACT_43893], the subject should remain on the trial and continue to 
receive monitoring according to the Study Calendar (see Section 6.1). 
 
 Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD): For the subjects who 
continue study therapy beyond prog ression, further progression is 
defined as an additional 20% increase in tumor burden with a minimum [ADDRESS_45917] evaluation. This 
includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial PD. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon 
documentation of further progression (i.e. irPD). 
7.2.[ADDRESS_45918] 1 
cycle(s) of therapy, and who have measur able disease present at baseline and 
have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. 
These patients will have their response classified acco rding to the definitions 
stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit obj ective or clinical disease progression 
prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
7.2.[ADDRESS_45919] one dim ension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
 
 10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice 
thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness or MRI 
 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be 
          accurately measured with calipers should be record as non-measurable)          
 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X-ray (if clearly def ined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]) 
                           
 All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions 
of centimeters). 
  Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by 
[CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only t he short axis will be measured and 
followed. 
  Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will only 
be considered measurable if they hav e had subsequent progression by [CONTACT_12697] 5mm. 
 
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_45920] scan), are considered non-me asurable disease. Bone lesions
 without 
measurable soft tissue component, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast 
disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable. 
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (non-nodal lesions with the longest  diameter), be representative of all 
involved organ(s), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. If a non-nodal lesion is either not present 
or is initially measured with longest di ameter <10mm as a non-target then grows 
to >10mm after baseline, this lesion then becomes a new target lesion as per 
irRECIST criteria. The non-nodal longest diameter is then added to the sum of 
diameters, and patient response is  calculated with the new lesion. 
 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since t hey are normal anatomical structures 
which may be visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions 
must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis 
of these nodes will contribute to the base line sum. The short axis of the node is 
 
Page [ADDRESS_45921] in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal or coronal). The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as 
being 20mm x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non-target le sions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters. If lymph nodes are to be incl uded in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  If a non-target lymph node grows to 
>15mm after baseline, this node then becomes a new target lesion as per 
irRECIST. The nodal short axis is then added to the sum of diameters, and 
patient response is calculated with the new lesion. 
 
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements ar e not required and these lesions should 
be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 
7.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be recorded in metric  notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported le sion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging 
based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and >10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the 
case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_43894] r photography including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_43895], imaging evaluati on should be undertaken since it is more 
objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
 
Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitiv e than X-ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on 
CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5mm or less. When CT 
scans have slice thickness great er than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion 
 
Page 36 of 52  should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for 
body scans). 
 Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in asse ssment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later dat e and, because they are operator dependent, 
it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from 
one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_43896], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to det ermine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 
 Cytology, Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR 
in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for ex ample, residual lesions in tumor types such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are 
known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds 
or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological c onfirmation of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during tr eatment can be consider ed if the measurable 
tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_45922] PD assessment, patients will be evaluated according the 
following RECISTv1.1 response: 
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by 
[CONTACT_43897] 4 weeks apart. There can be 
no appearance of new lesions. 
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% in crease in the sum of the LD of target 
lesions (with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm), taking as reference the 
smallest sum LD recorded since the trea tment started, or the appearance of one 
or more new lesions. 
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR (taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD) nor sufficient  increase to qualify for PD (taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started).  
For Cohort B only: After the first PD assessment per RECISTv1.1 (=irSD per 
irRECIST), patients will be evaluated for irPD  at least 4 weeks apart according to 
the following definition: 
 
Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD): At least a 20% increase in 
the sum of the LD of target lesions (with a minimum absolute increase of 
 
Page 37 of 52  5 mm), taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the 
treatment started, or appearance  of new lesions since the last 
evaluation. 
7.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes should be non-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-
target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal 
limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. 
 
Although a clear progression on non-target lesions in absence of stable 
target lesions is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_43841]. 
7.4.[ADDRESS_45923] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

7.5 Duration of Response - Non prostate malignancies 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whi chever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is ob jectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is  measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.  
7.6 Progression-Free Survival - Non prostate malignancies 
Radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start 
of treatment to time of radiographic progression  as defined above in section 7.[ADDRESS_45925] radiographic scan date.  
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as t he duration of time from start of treatment 
to time of radiographic or clinical progre ssion or death, the event that occurs first. 
Patients who have not experienced either event at the time of analysis will be censored at 
the date of their last progression assessment. 
 
7.7  Safety/Tolerability 
Analyses will be performed for all patients hav ing received at least one dose of study 
drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 4.03 for reporting of non-hematologic 
adverse events (http://ctep.ca ncer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)).

8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial and is 
done to ensure the safety of subjects enroll ed in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents. Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of the initial study drug administration  through  [ADDRESS_45928] dose of 
study drug, that is nivolumab and/or ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43844]. Any serious adverse event that occurs 
more than [ADDRESS_45929] also be reported. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed 
until: 
 Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event 
return to baseline; 
 There is satisfactory expla nation other than the study drug , nivolumab and/or 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] , for the changes observed; or  
 Death. 
The investigator is responsible for the dete ction, documentation,  grading and assignment 
of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below. It is the responsibility of t he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43845]. 
Any medical condition or laboratory abnorma lity with an onset date before initial study 
treatment administration is considered to be pre-existing in nature. Any known pre-
existing conditions that are ongoing at time of  study entry should be considered medical 
history. 
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE, as defined in Section 8.3, 
occurring from the initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_45930] be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s 
source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the study treatment. 
In addition to new events, any increase in the fr equency or severity (i.e., toxicity grade) of 
a pre-existing condition that occurs after t he patient begins study treatment is also 
considered an adverse event. 
8.3 Definitions 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medi cal occurrence in a patient receiving study 
treatment and which does not nec essarily have a causal relati onship with this treatment. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally a ssociated with the use of an experimental 
intervention, whether or not re lated to the intervention.  
 Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive (i.e., surgical) procedures 
will not be reported as adve rse events. Howe ver, the medical condition for 
which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets the definition of 
an adverse event unless it is a pre-existing (prior to protocol treatment) condition. 
 
 
Page 40 of 52   Abnormal laboratory values or test resu lts constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy. They are to be captured 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them. 
Serious Adverse Event 
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in  the view of either the investigator, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: 
  
 Death 
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself. 
 
 A life-threatening adverse event 
An adverse even is consider ed ‘life-threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator [or sponsor], its occurren ce places the patient or subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, had it 
occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death.  
 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43846] > 24 
hours. 
 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or  substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
 Important medical event 
Any event that may not result in deat h, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the outcomes listed in this definition 
of “Serious Adverse Event”. Exampl es of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; convulsions t hat do not result in inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4794]. 
 Previously planned (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should not be 
reported as SAEs unless th e underlying medical condition has worsened during the 
course of the study. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43847]’s medical history at the time of study 
enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43848] a precipit ating clinical AE (for example, for the administration of 
study therapy or other protocol-required procedure) should no t be considered SAEs. 
However, if the preexisting condition worsened during the course of the study, it should 
be reported as an SAE. 
 
Expected Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if: 
 For approved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
 For investigational new drugs or device s, those adverse events are described in 
the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
Page 41 of 52   In clinical research studies, inform ation on expected adverse events is also 
summarized in the protocol and in the consent document.  See section 9.[ADDRESS_45931] of expected adverse events related to the drug under study. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpec ted” if it is not described in the Package 
Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in the protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.4 Adverse Event Characteristics 
8.4.1 CTCAE Term 
(AE description) and grade: The descript ions and grading scales found in the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_45932] access to a copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.03. A copy of the CTC AE version 4.03 can be down loaded from the 
CTEP web site. ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ) 
8.4.2 Attribution of the AE 
The investigator or co-investigator is re sponsible for assignment of attribution. 
Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.   
Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.   
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.   
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.   
8.5 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines 
8.5.1 Reporting procedures for multi-site trials 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) and u nanticipated problems (UPs), regardless 
of causality to study drug, will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43849].  All SAEs  and UPs must be reported to the 
Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_45933] awareness of the event.  Events 
should be reported using the Coordinating  Center SAE form as available in the 
study database.  A copy of the Coordina ting Center SAE form as available in the 
study database should be sent to the Coordinating Center via fax at [PHONE_780] or via email to CTSU-Oncology-Mult [EMAIL_826] within 24 hours 
of the site’s knowledge of the event.  
Follow-up information must also be reported within 24 hours of receipt of the information by [CONTACT_093].  
Participating sites should report all SAEs and UPs to their local IRB per current local institutional standards.  
The Coordinating Center will disseminat e information regarding SAEs and UPs to 
the participating sites within 5 days of  review of the information by [CONTACT_43898]’s Principal Investigator (or designee in the event of 
extended absence) only in the case that the event(s) is believed to be related 
(i.e., possibly, probably, or definitely) to  the study drug. The Coordinating Center 
will be responsible for reporting of events to the FDA and supporters, as 
appropriate (outlined below).  
8.5.2 Reporting procedures to BMS 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) occurri ng from the initial study treatment 
administration through [ADDRESS_45934]  dose of the study treatment that are 
believed to be related to study drug will also be reported to BMS Worldwide 
safety.  
The Coordinating Center will send the initial completed SAE Form within 24 
hours of receipt via email to BMS Worldwide Safety ([EMAIL_555] ; Fax: [PHONE_188]).   
If only limited information is initially av ailable or an ongoing SAE changes in its 
intensity or relationship to the study drug, or if new information becomes 
available, a follow-up report will be gener ated and sent to BMS Worldwide Safety 
within 24 hours of receipt.   
8.5.3 Reporting procedures to FDA 
In this trial, serious, unexpected ad verse events believed to be definitely, 
probably or possibly related to the study  treatment will be reported to the Food 
and Drug Administration via the MedWatch 3500A Form. The Michigan IND/IDE 
Assistance Program (MIAP) (University of  Michigan) will assi st the IND Sponsor 
in reporting SAEs to the FDA that m eet the reporting requirements in [ADDRESS_45935] subjec ts or others at increased risk of harm, 
but no harm occurs. 
 
Upon becoming aware of any incident, experienc e, or outcome (not related to an adverse 
event) that may represent an unanticipated problem, the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem. The incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the 
following criteria: 
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency); 
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 
3. Suggests that the research  places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously kn own or recognized. 
If the investigator determines that the incident, experience, or outcome represents an 
unanticipated problem, the investigator must repor t it to the IRB within 7 calendar days of 
the study team becoming aware of the problem. 
8.8 Safety Report Reconciliation  
The Sponsor will reconcile t he clinical database SAE reports transmitted to BMS Global 
Pharmacovigilance ( Worldwide.Safety@bms .com).  Frequency of reconciliation should 
be every 3 months and prior to the database lock or final data summary.  BMS GPV&E 
 
Page [ADDRESS_45936] from the Investigat or, the GPV&E reconciliation report.  Requests 
for reconciliation should be sent to [EMAIL_177] .  The data elements 
listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for identification purposes.  If the 
Investigator determines a report was not transmitted to BMS GPV&E, the report should 
be sent immediately to BMS.   
 
 
9.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
9.1 Nivolumab  
 Other names for the drug: Opdivo  
 Description: Injection: 100 mg/10 mL solution in a single-dose vial.  
 
 Classification - type of agent: Imm unomodulatory; checkpoint inhibitor 
 
 Mode of action: Binding of the PD-[ADDRESS_45937] can contribute to inhibition 
of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Nivolumab is a human 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-[ADDRESS_45938]-mediated 
inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1  activity resulted in decreased tumor 
growth.  Combined nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (anti-CTLA-4) mediated inhibition results in enhanced T-cell function that is greater than the effects of either antibody 
alone, and results in improved anti-tumor responses in metastatic melanoma. In murine syngeneic tumor models, dual blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 resulted in 
increased anti-tumor activity. 
 
 Pharmacokinetics:  Nivolumab pharmacokinetics (PK) were assessed using a population PK approach 
for both single-agent nivolumab and nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  nivolumab as a single agent: The PK of single-agent was studied in patients over a 
dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks. Nivolumab clearance decreases over time, with a mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from baseline values of 
approximately 24.5% (47.6%) resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance 
(CLss) (CV%) of 8.2 mL/h (53.9%); the dec rease in CLss is not considered clinically 
relevant. The geometric mean volume of dist ribution at steady state (Vss) (CV%) is 
6.8 L (27.3%), and geometric mean eliminati on half-life (t1/2) is 25 days (77.5%). 
Steady-state concentrations of nivoluma b were reached by [CONTACT_3450] 12 weeks 
when administered at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was approximately 3.7-fold. The exposure to ni volumab increased dose proportionally 
over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks.  
 
Nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: The geometric mean (CV%) CL, Vss, and terminal halflife 
of nivolumab were 10.0 mL/h (50.3%),  7.92 L (30.1%), and 24.8 days (94.3%), 
respectively. When administered in combination, the CL of nivolumab was increased 
by 24%, whereas there was no effect on the clearance of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
 Side effects:  Nivolumab as a single agent: fatigue, rash, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus, diarrhea, 
 
Page [ADDRESS_45939] infection, and pyrexia.  
Nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: fatigue, rash, diarrhea, nausea, pyrexia, vomiting, and 
dyspnea.  
 
 Drug Interactions:  
No formal pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
nivolumab. 
 
 Storage and stability:  The product does not contain a preservative . After preparation, store the nivolumab 
infusion either:  
• at room temperature for no more than 8 hours from the time of preparation. This 
includes room temperature storage of the infusion in the IV container and time for 
administration of the infusion or  
• under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for no more than 24 hours from the 
time of infusion preparation. Do not freeze. 
 
 Preparation and Dispensing:  Visually inspect drug product solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration. Nivolumab is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale-yellow solution. 
Discard the vial if the solution is cl oudy, discolored, or contains extraneous 
particulate matter other than a few transluc ent-to-white, proteinaceous particles. Do 
not shake the vial. • Withdraw the required volume of nivolumab and transfer into an intravenous 
container.  • Dilute nivolumab with either 0.9% Sodium  Chloride Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose 
Injection, USP to prepare an infusion with a final concentration ranging from 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL.  
• Mix diluted solution by [CONTACT_5237]. Do not shake.  
• Discard partially used vials or empty vials of nivolumab.  
 
 Administration:  Administer the infusion over 30 minutes through an intravenous line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line filter (pore size of 0.2 micrometer to 
1.2 micrometer). Do not coadminister other  drugs through the same intravenous line. 
Flush the intravenous line at end of infusion. 
When administered in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], infuse nivolumab first followed by 
[CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_43850]. Use separate infusion bags and filters for each infusion. 
 
 Availability : Provided by [CONTACT_43899], Inc. 
 Return and Retention of Study Drug:  
 Handling and disposal of nivolumab should be per institutional guidelines for the handling and disposal of biologic and cytotoxic agents  
 
 Drug Accountability: 
 The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain 
a careful record of the inventory and disposition of nivolumab. The drug 
accountability records will capture drug receipt, drug dispensing, drug return and final 
disposition.

0.3 to 10 mg/kg. Following administration of  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43852] [ADDRESS_45940] dose; the mean Cmin  at steady state was 19.4 mcg/mL at 3 
mg/kg and 58.1 mcg/mL at 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The mean value (percent coefficient of variation) based on population PK analysis for the terminal half-life (t1/2) was 15.4 days (34%) and for clearanc e (CL) was 16.8 mL/h (38%). Specific 
Populations The effects of various covariates on the PK of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43853]. The CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43854] (mg/kg) based dosing. The 
following factors had no clinically important effect on the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: age (range: 23 to 88 years), sex, performance  status, renal impairment, mild hepatic 
impairment, previous cancer therapy, and baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
levels. The effect of race was not examined due to limited data available in non-Caucasian ethnic groups.   
Renal Impairment:
 No clinically important differences in the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43855].  
Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43856] (n=76) compared to patients with

10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES 
Specimens will be collected for banking and archival purposes. Submission of samples for 
correlative studies is expected of all subjec ts at baseline and optional tumor biopsy will be 
performed for those who consent to it. 
10.[ADDRESS_45941] documented CDK12 loss on a prior biopsy 
(or 
cell-free DNA or other is allowed ) of primary or metastatic tissue. Metastatic tissue is 
strongly preferred.   
Willingness to provide archival tissue submission is mandatory. If archival tissue,  contains 
inadequate tissue for NGS (i.e., less than 30% tumor content) or patient does not consent 
to fresh tissue biopsy, or fresh biopsy is not feasible, then patient may enroll in study if all 
other eligibility criteria are met. In general, vi sceral metastases are prioritized over soft 
tissue or lymph node, and least preferable are bone metastases.   
Refer to Section 6.0 for tumor tissue and blood collection time points and Lab Manual for 
collection and processing details.  
 
  
10.2 Specimen Banking 
Patient samples (tissue and blood) collected for this study will be retained at the University of Michigan. Specim ens will be stored indefinitely or until they are used up. If 
future use is denied or withdrawn by [CONTACT_102], best efforts will be made to stop any additional studies and to destroy the specimens.

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints 
This is a multi-center, prospective, one arm, 3 cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of 
immunotherapy in patients with metastatic cancers and CDK12  loss. Patients with 
metastatic castration re sistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will be enrolled in Cohort A until 
25 evaluable patients are identified. Once Cohort A is full, mCRPC patients will enroll in 
Cohort C. Patients with other metastatic subtypes will be enrolled in Cohort B. 
 
An Mini-Max Simon Two-Stage design will be used to assess ORR defined as a 50% 
decline in PSA from baseline in CDK12 loss of function metastatic CRPC patients.  It is 
assumed that an ORR of 30% or more would be interesting for further study compared to 
a reference ORR of 10% based on the KEYNOTE- 199 trial [35]. Accrual of 25 objective 
PSA response evaluable patients will provide 80%  power to detect this difference in ORR 
with a type I error of 5%.  Interim analysis will be completed after 15 objective PSA 
response evaluable patients (Cohort A only).  If [ADDRESS_45942] a PSA response, then the treatment will be re commended for further study in this 
population.  
 
Cohort B will accrue 15 patients with non-prostate histology. A reference ORR of 5% is 
assumed in patients with non-prostate hist ology.  With [ADDRESS_45943] 76% power 
to detect an ORR of 25% with a one-sided type I error of 5%.  If 3 or more responses are 
seen in cohort B then we will conclude that there is preliminary evidence of activity. 
 
Cohort C will accrue 25 mCRPC patients. A re ference ORR of 10% is  assumed, allowing 
80% power to detect an ORR of 30% or more wi th a one-sided type I error of 5%. If [ADDRESS_45944] a PSA respons e, then the treatment will be recommended 
for further study in this population. 
 
11.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
The trial is expected to accrue the total study population of 65 pat ients harboring CDK12 
loss, including 50 objective PSA response eval uable metastatic prostate cancer patients 
and 15 objective response evaluable patients wi th non-prostate tumor histology over 2 
years.  
11.3 Data Analyses Plans 
 
Primary Endpoint Analysis:  The primary endpoint for Cohort A and Coho rt C is overall resp onse rate using PSA 
criteria. The primary analysis will include the response count and proportion with the 
associated exact 95% binomial confidence in terval in the mCRPC cohort. If stage 2 is 
initiated, then the efficacy analysis methods for the reported response confidence interval 
will be as described by [CONTACT_43900] [33].   
Secondary Endpoint Analysis: Efficacy in Cohort B will be described using ov erall response rate (CR/PR) using RECIST 
1.1 criteria. The response count and proporti on will be reported with the associated 95% 
exact binomial confidence interval. 
 
 
Page 48 of 52   Safety and tolerability of, nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43810], or nivolumab monotherapy only, will be described by [CONTACT_43901]. The proportion of patients 
removed from treatment due to AEs will be reported.  The number and proportion of 
patients with dose reductions and/or holds w ill be reported separately and overall.  Each 
measure will be reported for the entir e trial and separately by [CONTACT_9084]. 
 
 Secondary efficacy time-to-event endpoint s including radiographic progression-free 
survival (rPFS), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR) among 
responders, duration of therapy (DOT), time  to progression (TTP) and overall survival 
(OS) will be reported using Kaplan-Meier met hods. The median, if reached, and the 52-
week event-free proportion with the associated 95% greenwood formula confidence interval will be reported for each endpoin t. For subjects with metastatic CRPC, PSA 
progression-free survival and time to PSA pr ogression by [CONTACT_43877]3 criteria will also be 
described for Cohort A
 using the same the Kaplan-Meier measures described previously. 
Objective tumor resp onse in patients with measurable di sease by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria will 
reported separately by [CONTACT_43902] 3 recommendations and will include waterfall 
plots and counts with proportions  and the associated 95% conf idence intervals. Each 
endpoint will be reported for all patients if applicable and separately for each cohort.  
 
 Quality of Life (QoL) in subjects treated on protocol therapy will be described using 
EORTC-QLQ-C30 and BPI-SF measures.  Baseline will be described using means or 
medians with an associated va riance statistic.  Change fr om baseline will be reported at 
each time point thereafter with similar de scriptive statistics. Each measure will be 
reported for the overall population and separately by [CONTACT_9084]. Each QoL change from baseline will be analyzed using a general linear model with repeated measures for an association with response. 
    Exploratory Endpoint Analysis     
 Tumor genome profiling by [CONTACT_43903]. 
These figures will order patient s by [CONTACT_43904] (PSA response for Cohort A and 
Cohort C; and RECIST response for Cohort B).  A logistic model with response as the outcome may be used with specific markers as independent covariates to estimate an 
effect size if a profound pattern is seen.  Differences seen in paired samples (baseline 
and progression) will be described individually and labeled as a responder/non-responder.  Immune infiltration in tumor biopsies will be described using figures. 
Associations of the profiles with the response will be described using counts and 
proportions. 
 
 
12.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
This study will be monitored in accordance wi th the NCI approved University of Michigan Rogel 
Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, wi th oversight by [CONTACT_43905] (DSMC). 
 
The Sponsor-Investigator (S-I)/St udy Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43863] r egular data review with participating sites 
 The Sponsor-Investigator (S-I)/St udy Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Project Manager/Delegate 
will review data and patient safety issues with participating sites per a defined quarterly meeting cadence. Depending on the protocol activity, the meeting cadence may be more frequent. This 
data review meeting may be achieved via a telec onference or another similar mechanism to 
discuss matters related to: 
 
Page 49 of 52   
 Enrollment rate relative to expectati ons, characteristics of participants 
 Safety of study participants (Serious Adverse Event & Adverse Event reporting) 
 Adherence to protocol (protocol deviations) 
 Completeness, validity and integrity of study data 
 Retention of study participants 
 
Participating sites are required to ensure all per tinent data for the review period are available in 
the database at the time of the discussion. 
 
Participating sites unable to participate in the data review meeting are required to provide written 
confirmation that their site has reviewed the relevant data and patient safety issues for the review 
period and their site’s data are in alignment with the data reported in the database. Written 
confirmation is to be provided to the Project M anager/Delegate within the timeline requested to 
retain compliance with monitoring timelines. 
 
Documentation of the teleconference or alternat e mechanism utilized to review items above is to 
be retained in the Trial Master File.  
 
The Project Manager/Delegate is responsible for collating the data from all participating sites and completing the Protocol Specific Data and Safety Monitoring Report (D SMR) form to document 
the data review meeting discussion.   The DSMR will be signed by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigat or (S-I)/Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43864]-Investigator and submitted to the DSMC on a quarterly basis for independent review. 
 
13.0 DATA MANAGEMENT 
All information will be recorded locally and entered into Case Report Forms (CRFs) on the web-
based electronic data capture (EDC) system of t he University of Michig an. Online access will be 
provided to each site by [CONTACT_5081].  
 
CRFs will be reviewed and source verified by [CONTACT_43906]. Discrepant, unusual and incomplete data will be queried by [CONTACT_43907]. The 
investigator or study coordinator will be responsible for providing resolutions to the data queries, 
as appropriate. The investigator must ensure  that all data queries are dealt with promptly.  
 The data submission schedule is as follows:  
 After subject enrollment   
o Subject Status 
o Demographics 
 During study participation 
o All data should be entered online within [ADDRESS_45945] be entered within the reporting timeframe specified in Section 8 of the protocol.  
  All study information should be recorded in an appropriate source document (e.g. clinic chart).

the trial if the committee identifies a need for a more rigorous evaluation of study-related issues.  
 
 
Page 50 of 52  A regulatory authority (e.g. FDA) may also wish to conduct an inspection of the study, during its 
conduct or even after its completion. If an in spection has been requested by a regulatory 
authority, the site investigator must immediately inform the Coordinating Center that such a 
request has been made. 
 
15.[ADDRESS_45947] be conducted 
in accordance with the ethical principles that are consistent with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and 
in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study will be monitored by a representative of the Coordinati ng Center of the Rogel Cancer 
Center. Monitoring visits will be made during the conduct of the study and at study close-out. 
 
Prior to subject recruitment, a participating site will undergo a site initiation meeting to be conducted 
by [CONTACT_5081]. Th is will be done as an actual site visit; teleconference, 
videoconference, or web-based meeting after the si te has been given access to the study database 
and assembled a study reference binder.  The site’s  principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/her study staff 
should make every effort in attending the site init iation meeting. Study–related questions or issues 
identified during the site initiation meeting will be followed-up by [CONTACT_43908].  
Monitoring of this study can include both ‘Centralized Monitoring’, the review of source documents 
at the Coordinating Center and ‘On-site Monitoring’, an actual site visit.  The first ‘Centralized’ visit 
should occur after the first subject enrolled complete s the first treatment cycle.  The study site will 
send the de-identified source documents to the C oordinating Center for monitoring.  ‘Centralized’ 
monitoring may be requested by [CONTACT_43909]. The site will send in pertinent  de-identified source documents, as defined by 
[CONTACT_43910].   The first annual ‘On-site’ monitoring visit should occur after the first five study participants are 
enrolled or twelve months after a study opens, whichever occurs first. The annual visit may be 
conducted as a ‘Centralized’ visit if less than three subjects have enrolled at the study site.  The 
type of visit is at the discretion of the Coordinating Center.  At a minimum, a routine monitoring visit 
will be done at least once a year, or once during the course of the study if the study duration is less 
than 12 months. The purpose of these visits is to verify: 
 
 Adherence to the protocol 
 Completeness and accuracy of study data and samples collected 
 Proper storage, dispensing and inventory of study medication 
 Compliance with regulations 
 During a monitoring visit to a site, access to relevant  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43866].  While most patient 
cases will be selected from patients accrued since th e previous monitoring visit, any patient case 
has the potential for review.  At least one or more unannounced cases will be reviewed, if the total 
accruals warrant selecti on of unannounced cases.  
 
The Coordinating Center expects the relevant invest igational staff to be available to facilitate the 
conduct of the visit, that source documents are avai lable at the time of the visit, and that a suitable 
environment will be provided for review of study-r elated documents. Any issues identified during 
these visits will be communicated to the site and are expected to be resolved by [CONTACT_16547] a timely 
manner.  For review of study-related documents at  the Coordinating Center, the site will be required 
to ship or fax documents to be reviewed.

Investigator is aware of his/her ongoing responsibilities. In general, a site close-out is conducted during a site visit; however, site close-out can occur without a site visit.

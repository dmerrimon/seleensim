Page 1 of 5An Initial Feasibility Study of Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicidal Inpatients
Rationale. Suicide  is a major  public health  problem: suicidal ideation affects 14% of  the adult  U.S. population, and 
as many  as 5% have a lifetime history of suicide attempts.1 Among individuals with  depressive disorders,  there  is an 
11% mortality  rate from  suicide.[ADDRESS_1050270] of all suicides  by [CONTACT_765979] 90 
days following  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].3 A review of nearly 2 million adult psychiatric  inpatients  found that the suicide rate 
in the  90 days  after discharge for patients  diagnosed  with depressive disorders was 235.1 per  100,000 person-years,  
markedly higher  than that in the US  general  population (14.2 per  100,000 person-years).4 
Cognitive behavioral  therapy (CBT)  has been  shown  to reduce both suicidal ideation  and behavior.5-[ADDRESS_1050271] are to:
1.develop and implement a brief CBT for suicide prevention on the adult inpatient units;
2.conduct a brief feasibility  test and collect initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_765972]; and
3.collect preliminary data on the effects of CBT on implicit cognitive suicide associations.
Method. We selected Rudd  et al.’s12 CBT  protocol for the proposed project. This protocol was tested  in a 
randomized controlled trial  (RCT) of outpatients and resulted in a significant reduction in  suicide attempts over a 
24-month follow-up assessment (hazard ratio = 0.38); those receiving CBT were  60%  less likely  to make a suicide 
attempt than were those receiving treatment as usual.[ADDRESS_1050272],  which are described below:
In Phase [ADDRESS_1050273] an initial  feasibility trial with  5-10 inpatients.  
Participants. We will recruit  5-10  consecutive adult inpatients (dependent on flow  within  the 6-month treatment 
window) from  the Donnelly  units.  Inclusion  criteria  will be:
1.males and females
2.age 18-65 inclusive
3.fluent in English (speaking, reading, and writing)
4.having made a  suicide  attempt within one  week preceding  admission. Admission will  be defined  as 
admission to either Harford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765973] (in cases where medical  stabilization  is required 
prior to transfer to IOL)  or to IOL (in cases where medical stabilization is not  required). A suicide  
attempt will be defined as behavior that is self-directed  and deliberately results in  injury  or the 
potential for injury to oneself for which  there is  evidence, whether  explicit  or implicit, of intent to  die.
Exclusion criteria will be:
1.age <18 or ≥66 years old
2.history of schizophrenia spectrum disorder
3.history of mental retardation or organic brain illness
4.current  substance use disorder

6.ECT included on patient’s inpatient treatment plan. Patients who  are referred for ECT after starting  the 
study will  be withdrawn  from  the study. 
Measures. Participants will complete  a brief self-report demographic form. Diagnostic status will be measured at 
pre-treatment using the Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders  
(DIAMOND).14 Suicidal ideation and  behavior will be assessed  using the  Columbia-Suicide  Severity Rating  Scale 
(C-SSRS).15 The C-SSRS can be scored to yield an ideation severity  score (range  0-5) and a behavior severity score 
(0-5); suicidal behavior can also be scored dichotomously (present/absent). The C-SSRS will be administered with  
the timeframe for the  “past  week” at admission  (i.e., pretreatment), and “since  admission” at  posttreatment,  and 
“past week” at follow-up assessments. Depressive symptoms will be measured using the  Structured Interview 
Guidelines for the Hamilton  Rating Scale for Depression (SIGH-D),16 a well-validated  clinician-rated interview for 
depression. Treatment acceptability will  be measured using the  Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ),[ADDRESS_1050274]  (IAT).[ADDRESS_1050275]  that uses people’s reaction times  when  classifying  semantic stimuli  to measure the 
automatic mental associations they hold about various topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102],  in this case, life  and death/suicide. Participants 
classify stimuli representing the constructs  of “death” (i.e., die, dead, deceased,  lifeless,  and suicide) and “life” ( i.e., 
alive, survive, live,  thrive, and  breathing) and the attributes of “me” (i.e., I, myself, my,  mine, and  self)  and “not  me” 
(i.e., they, them, their, theirs,  and other). Response latencies for all trials are recorded. The relative strength  of each 
participant’s association between “death” and “me” is indexed by  [CONTACT_147572]  a D score for each participant;  positive  
D scores  represent a  stronger association between death and self (i.e., faster responding on the “death”/“me” blocks 
relative to the “life”/“me”  blocks), and negative scores represent a stronger association between life  and self. 
Procedures. It  is anticipated  that the treatment component  of the study will take place over a period of six months.
Participants will  be recruited by a member  of the  research staff on the day following  their  inpatient  admission  or 
later (for  example  in the case of  a Saturday  admission). Patients who meet  all of the inclusion criteria  and none of  
the exclusion criteria and agree to participate  will provide  written informed consent prior to  any study procedures. 
Informed consent will be  documented using the Documentation  of Informed Consent  Form. For patients who  are 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_765974]. 
Only those involuntarily  committed patients who have been found competent to provide informed consent for 
research will be consented. Patients who decline participation will not be  approached  again. Patients who  agree  to 
participation will undergo  the informed consent process. This process will  involve  providing the patient  with  the 
informed consent  and HIPAA authorization forms to read. The study staff  member obtaining consent will highlight  
the voluntary nature of the  research and  emphasize  that the patient’s decision whether or  not to participate will not  
impact his “usual care” treatment plan; however, patients will  also be  informed that the  information discussed with  
the study clinician is shared with the inpatient treatment  team, and thus may be used by [CONTACT_765980]. Patients will be informed that  they may keep  the forms to review with others  if 
they wish to do so before signing. In  addition,  all questions the patient has about study participation will be 
answered prior to obtaining written consent. 
Enrolled participants will undergo a clinical  assessment by [CONTACT_213999] (IE), who  will administer  the 
DIAMOND, C-SSRS,  SIGH-D, and IAT. 
Participants will  receive up to 10 daily  sessions  of CBT (depending on length of stay),  lasting  1.[ADDRESS_1050276] conducts a  detailed assessment of  the

strategies to reduce beliefs and  assumptions that serve as vulnerabilities to suicidal behavior ( e.g., hopelessness, 
perceived burdensomeness, guilt  and shame). During the  first session  of CBT, participants are provided with  a small 
pocket-sized notebook (called  a “smart book”) in which they are directed to  record a “lesson  learned” at  the 
conclusion of each session. Lessons learned include new skills learned or knowledge gained by [CONTACT_765982]. Participants  are encouraged  to use  the smart book in the future  as a memory aid  for managing  
emotional distress  and solving problems. 
Data Storage and  Security. Audiotapes will be  made of each session. All  CBT sessions will be audiotaped using  
digital recorders. Audio files will  be stored electronically with password-access login maintained  on the HHC 
server. Access to the audiofiles will be limited to IRB-approved study  staff. Files will be maintained for [ADDRESS_1050277] a telephone 
interview at 1 month,  2 month, and 3 month follow-up. The IE will administer the  C-SSRS during these calls. Chart  
review (via Epic)  will also be completed on study eligible participants  (whether  or not recruited). Data  retrieved at 1, 
2, and 3-month post-discharge will  include  readmission rates to the IOL or ED.  Whether  suicide attempt preceded 
admission will also be recorded. Demographic and clinical information will also  be collected from  the medical 
record (age  when < or = 89, sex, race/ethnicity, diagnoses, medication, length of  stay, suicide  method) to  compare 
study eligible participants who were versus were not recruited to determine if the  groups were  matched on these 
variables. At least  three telephone calls will be  made  to try  to reach a participant to complete the follow-up 
assessments. If a participant is  unable  to be reached by [CONTACT_765983]-up assessment after three  tries  then a 
letter will be sent to the participant asking them to contact [CONTACT_765984]. If a participant fails to contact  [CONTACT_765985]  [ADDRESS_1050278] the IE by [CONTACT_765986].   
Adverse Event reporting.
Any severe  adverse events (SAEs)  that occur will  be reported to the HHC IRB  in a timely fashion,  according  to 
policy 901.  Unexpected Severe AE’s – those rated 3-5 – will be  reported within [ADDRESS_1050279] significance tests, of greater  importance are the following outcomes  (all 
analyses will be  intent-to-treat):
1.Mean  CSQ scores at post-treatment, indicating  acceptability of  treatment.
2.Percent attrition  rate, indicating acceptability of treatment.
3.Mean  treatment fidelity rating, indicating our  capacity to administer the treatment as described.
4.Effect size (Hedges’s g) of  IAT D scores from pre- to post-treatment

Future Plans. The proposed study will yield feasibility and  initial efficacy  data that will be used to  inform a grant 
proposal to the American  Foundation for Suicide Prevention. That proposal  will fund  a randomized controlled  trial 
of CBT vs. treatment as usual.  Concurrently, we will develop an in-house program  to train other staff  in the 
protocol, and will submit a second grant to investigate  the efficacy  of the training program as well as  the efficacy of 
CBT by [CONTACT_765987] (benchmarking analysis).

Title of Study : A Phase 3,  Randomized, Double -Blind, Double -Dummy, Multicenter, Prospective 
Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Eravacycline Compared with Meropenem  
in Complicated Intra -abdominal Infections  
Indication:  Complicated Intra -abdominal Infections  (cIAI)  
Anticipated Study Period:  3Q 2016 -4Q 2017  
Objectives:  
Primary Objective : 
▪ The primary objective is to c ompare the clinical response at the test -of-cure (TOC) visit in the microbiological 
intent -to-treat (micro -ITT) population for subjects in the 2 treatment arms  
NOTE:  For the EMA, the primary analysis populations will be the all -treated (MITT)  and the clinically evaluable 
(CE) populations  
Secondary Objectives:  
▪ To compare the c linical response for subjects in the 2 treatment arms at the end-of-treatment (EOT),  TOC , and 
follow -up (FU) visits in the following populations:  
- Intent -to-treat (ITT) population  
- All-treated (MITT)  
- Clinically evaluable (CE) population  
- Micro -ITT population (for EOT and FU) 
- Microbiologically evaluable (ME) population  
▪ To compare the microbiologic  response  in the treatment arms  at the EOT and TOC visit s in the following 
populations:  
- Micro -ITT population  
- ME population  
▪ To assess the safety and tolerability of eravacycline adm inistration in the safety population  
▪ To explore pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of eravacycline  
Methodology:  
This is a phase 3, r andomi zed, double -blind, double -dummy, multicenter, prospective study to assess the efficacy, safety 
and PK of eravacycline compared  with meropenem  in the treatment of cIAIs.  
Once an informed consent is  obtained and study eligibility is established,  subjects will be enrolled and r andomiz ed to 
either the eravacycline (1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours [q12h])  or the meropenem (1 g q8h) treatment arm in a 1 :1 ratio.  
Randomization  will be stratified  based on primar y site of infection (complicated a ppendicitis versus all other diagnoses ).  
An enrollment cap of  approximately  50% complicated appendicitis  is planned.  
Specified s tudy personnel will remain blinded to the identity of intravenous (IV) study drug until the d atabase has been 
locked.   
Study drug will be administered in 24 -h dosing cycles according to Table 1  below :

Meropenem  will be used in accordance with its most recent prescribing information.  
The interval between the 1st Doses of a djacent  24-h dosing cycle s can be reduced by [CONTACT_8622] [ADDRESS_1028641] 24 -h dosing cycle, the allowable administration window for each infusion is ± [ADDRESS_1028642] appropriate specimens for culture at the time of the initial procedure and inoculate into 
appropriate media for aerobes and anaerobes immediately. These specimens will be cultured and quantified in the local 
laboratory or a reference regional lab oratory .  The isolate(s) will be sent to a central microbiology laboratory for 
validation of identification and susceptibility testing.    
Aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures will be obtained at two separate sterile venipuncture sites prior to initiation of  
clinical trial drug therapy.  Upon knowledge of a positive culture for a pathogen, blood cultures should be repeated until 
sterile (ie, both sets of cultures from two separate venipuncture sites are negative for pathogens)  through the FU visit .  If 
baseli ne cultures are negative, follow -up cultures should be obtained only if clinically indicated (eg, worsening of signs

Test Product, Dose and Route of Administration:  
Eravacycline was synthesized under current good manufacturing practices , and the drug product contains 50.0 mg 
(TP-434 free base equivalents) of lyophilized powder  in a 10 mL vial .  Eravacycline  will be reconstituted with 5 mL of 
sterile water and further diluted with sterile normal saline, to generate 0.3 mg/mL erav acycline solution s for 1.0 mg/kg  
q12h IV infusion s. Please refer to applicable protocol section(s) and the Pharmacy Manual for additional information.  
Reference Therapy, Dose and Route of Administration:  
Meropenem  1 g administered by [CONTACT_24636] q8h. Meropenem  infusion solutions will be prepared according to the full 
prescribing information of meropenem  (comparator) . 
Duration of Treatment:  
The expected minimum treatment duration is four [ADDRESS_1028652] resolved.  If study drug is needed for longer than seven 24 -h dosing cycles, cases will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_1689].  The TOC visit will be 25 -31 days after the initial dose of study drug.  The follow -up 
visit will be conducted 38 -50 days after the initial dose of study drug.  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0-12 will be determined.  
 
Statistical Methods  and Criteria for Evaluation : 
Sample Size Estimate:  
This study is designed to demonstrate non -inferiority of 1.0 mg/kg q12h eravacycline to meropenem, and a 12.5% non -
inferiority margin will be used to determine success.  A non -inferiority trial with a one -sided alpha of 0.025, 80% power, 
a non -inferiority margin (delta)  of 12.5%, and projected response rates of 84% in the eravacycline group and 85% in the 
meropenem group would  need 161 subjects per arm in the micro -ITT population. A sample size of approximately 466 
randomized subjects should provide sufficient numbers for this study, assuming 68.75 % of enrolled subjects will meet 
the requirements for inclusion in the micro -ITT population .

Version 2.0 Confidential  Page 8 of 58 Safety:  
Safety analyses will be con ducted in the safety population. Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment 
received.  
Adverse Events  
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to Preferred Terms and System Organ Classes using Medical Dictio nary 
of Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) and tabulated by [CONTACT_2939]. The number and percentage of subjects who 
experience  treatment -emer gent AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be presented by [CONTACT_751312] O rgan 
Class and Preferred Term .  Each  subject will be counted once for each level of reporting.  Tabulations by [CONTACT_128498], as reported by [CONTACT_473] , will also be provided.  Deaths and premature discontinuations 
from study drug due to an AE will be identified.  
Laboratory Data  
Hematology, chemistry,  and coagulation  will be summarized using : shift tables based on toxicity criteria ; change from 
baseline ; and the number and percentage of subjects  with at least a two grade  increase from baseline.  Detailed listings of 
all laboratory data collected during the study will be provided.   
Other Safety Data  
Clinically relevant p hysical examination s will be performed  and clinically significant findings collected  as AEs.  Vital 
signs  and ECG findings will be summarized using descriptive statistics for change from baseline and percentage of 
subjects with an abnormal  value as defined in the S tatistical Analysis Plan. 
Efficacy Assessments:  
Clinical cure rates will be determined along with 95% CIs for each  treatment arm  overall  and for the randomization 
stratification factor of primary site of infection. The clinical cure rate will be determined as the number of subjects  with 
Clinical Cure (ie, complete or  significant improvement of signs or symptoms such that no additional  antib acterial  
therapy, surgical, or radiological intervention  is required) at the respective visit divided by [CONTACT_751313]  (ie, overall or by [CONTACT_751314]) .  A 95% CI around the difference in the eravacycline and 
meropenem clinical cure  rates will be determined using the Miettinen and Nurminen method.  If the lower bound of the 
95% CI is above -12.5% for the difference in the overall clinical c ure rate, noninferiority of eravacycline to meropenem 
will be concluded.  
Per pathogen and per subject microbiological  response rates will be determined, along with 95% CIs , by [CONTACT_2939] . 
The per pathogen microbiological response rate will be determined  as the number of subjects  with a favorable response 
(ie, eradication or presumptive eradication) at the respective  visit divided by [CONTACT_751315]. The per subject  microbiological response rate will be determined as the 
number of subjects  with a favorable response ( ie, eradication or presumptive eradication) at the respective  visit divided 
by [CONTACT_751316].  
Microbiology:  
Bacterial isolates cultured from ae robic and anaerobic cIAI specimens and blood will be evaluated for susceptibility and 
the emergence of resistance to study drugs and overgrowth of non -susceptible organisms.

Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 18 of 58 6. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
6.1 Intra -abdominal Infections  
Complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAIs) extend beyond the hollow viscus of origin into 
the peritoneal or retroperitoneal spaces  and are associated with either abscess formation or 
peritonitis and systemic signs and symptoms of illness .  cIAIs are a common problem in clinical 
practice and consume substantial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_751295]. Although a wide range of 
individual antimicrobial agents and combinations of agents are available for use in cIAI, no 
regimen to date has been consistently demonstrat ed to be superior or inferior. Antibiotics used 
for the empi[INVESTIGATOR_751296] -negative aerobic 
and facultative bacilli and enteric Gram -positive streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci. In 
addition, cover age for obligate anaerobic bacilli is recommended for distal small bowel, 
appendiceal, and colon -derived infections and for more proximal gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforations in the presence of obstruction or paralytic ileus. With the exception of carbapenem  
antibiotics, there are few broad -spectrum antibiotics to cover all the potential pathogens to which 
the peritoneum is exposed following a perforation of the intestinal tract [1]   
Infections due to multidrug -resistant organisms are even more difficult to treat and eradicate 
because they do not respond to many common antibiotics, and in some cases do not respond to 
even the most powerful ones, such as carbapenems. The carbapenems are  becoming less 
effective because carbapenemases and porin changes that mediate resistance have become more 
common, even in enteric bacteria. Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter species 
are more likely than others to develop multidrug resista nce. Thus, there is a need for broad -
spectrum antibiotics with appropriate pharmacokinetics (PK) to empi[INVESTIGATOR_751297]. Eravacycline (TP -434) is a candidate for the treatment of 
serious and life -threatenin g infections, including those caused by [CONTACT_751318]. Eravacycline is very effective in animal models of infection  [2]. 
6.[ADDRESS_1028669] -spectrum fluorocycline antibiotic of the tetracycline 
class.  The mechanism of action behind the antibiotic property of eravacycline is related to its 
ability to bind to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis  [3]. 
Eravacycline is more potent than legacy tetracyclines and is highly active against clinically 
important MDR Gram -negative and Gram -positive aerobic and anaerobic pathogens, including 
Enterobacteriaceae that produce ESBLs and/or carbape nemases from all of the Ambler classes.  
Eravacycline is also unique among antimicrobials in late -stage development in that it possesses 
potent activity against CRAB, including those with blaOXA carbapenemases and against 
Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumanni i containing MBLs, and isolates displaying MDR .  
Eravacycline exhibits potency profiles similar to those of the carbapenems but more broadly 
covers Gram -positive pathogens like MRSA and enterococci, and is active against carbapenem -
resistant Gram -negative bacteria. Eravacycline is being developed for the treatment of cIAIs and 
has been shown to have in vitro potency and spectrum to provide protection from infection by 
[CONTACT_751319]  [4]. 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028670] or metabolism -dependen t inhibitors of microsomal P450 enzymes. TP -6208 did not induce 
major CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4), but TP -034 induced CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 [5]. In transport studies, eravacycline inhibited MDR1 (P -gp), OATP1B3, and OAT3 
activity at 20  µg/mL. Clinically relevant concentrations of TP -6208 or TP -034 did not inhibit any 
of 11 major transporters. Neither eravacycline (up to concentrations of 5 µg/mL) nor TP -6208 
(up to 2.5 µg/mL) were substrates for MDR1, BCRP, OATP1B1, O ATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT1, and OCT2, but TP -034 was identified as a potential substrate for the efflux transporters 
P-gp, BCRP, and BSEP [6].  
Eravacycline  is highly active in vitro  against emerging pathogens like Acinetobacter  baumannii  
as well as clinically important species of Enterobacteriaceae  (including those isolates  that 
produce extended -spectrum beta -lactamases and/or are carbapenem -resistant ) and anaerobes.  
Eravacycline may not exhibit high activity against  Pseudomonas a erugonisa  when it is the sole 
pathogen. The full description of the in vitro  antibacterial activity of eravacycline  can be found 
in the Investigator ’s Brochure  (IB).  
The high degree and reliability of in vitro  antibacterial activity against multidrug -resistant Gram-
negative and Gram-positive aerobic, facultative, and obligate pathogens ; efficacy observed with 
eravacycline  in established animal models of infection ; and the efficacy and tolerability 
established i n a phase 2  and a phase 3  study of  subjects with  cIAIs warrant clinical development 
of eravacycline  as a single therapy treatment option for cIAIs and other serious bacterial 
infections.  
6.3 Clinical Experience  
Intravenously administered eravacycline has been studied in fifteen completed clinical trials in 
healthy subjects,  in two studies with special populations (subjects with renal impairment and 
subjects with hepatic impairment), in phase [ADDRESS_1028671] been observed at the higher doses of eravacycline administered as 
both IV and PO formulations.   
Please refer to the current IB f or details of the eravacycline clinical studies and adverse event 
(AE) profile .

Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 20 of 58 6.3.1 Phase 2 Study in Subjects  with cIAI (TP -434-P2-cIAI -1) 
The proof of concept of eravacycline for the treatment of infections was demonstrated in a phase 
2 study of subjects with  cIAI. The cure rates [% (95% confidence interval [ CI])] in the 
microbiologically evaluable population ( ME) population at the T est of Cure (T OC) visit were 
92.9 (80.5 -98.5), 100 (91.4 -100), and 92.3 (74.9 –99.1) for the eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg q24h, the 
eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h, and the ertapenem 1.0 g q24h groups, respectively.  There were no 
SAE s that were considered by [CONTACT_7185], and there were no new 
safety signals for eravacycline identified in this study.  Overall, treatment emergent AEs were 
reported as 35.8%, 28.6%, and 26.7% of subjects in the eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg q24h, the 
eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h, and the ertapenem 1.0 g q24h groups, respectively.  Nausea was 
reported in 1.9%, 10.7%, and 6.7%  of subjects ; and vomiting  in 5.7%, 1.8%, and 0% of subjects 
in the eravacycline 1.5  mg/kg q24h, the eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q24h, and the ertapenem 1.0 g 
q24h groups, respectively.  The incidence of infusion site reactions  was 1.9% and 3.6% in the 
eravacycline 1.5  mg/kg q24h and the eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h groups, respectively , lower 
than the incidence  observed in the phase 1 studies, probably resulting from the decreased dosing 
concentration used in the phase  2 study . 
6.3.2 Phase 3 Study in Subjects with cIAI (TP -434-008) 
The efficacy of IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI was confirmed in a phase 3, randomized, 
double -blind, double -dummy, multicenter, prospective study comparing IV eravacycline (1.0 
mg/kg q12h [ERV]) with IV ertapenem (1 g q24h [ERT]) in subjects with cIAI. A total of [ADDRESS_1028672] of Cure visit were 86.8 and 87.6% in the ERV  and ERT  groups, respectively.  The 
between treatment group difference [% (95% CI)] was -0.80 ( -7.1, 5.5), a llowing non -inferiority 
to be declared and supporting the efficacy of eravacycline in the treatment of cIAI.  
Eravacycline was safe and generally well -tolerated in subjects with cIAI. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders, includ ing nausea (8.1% and 0.7% in the ERV 
and ERT groups, respectively) and vomiting (4.1% and 3.4% in the ERV and ERT groups, 
respectively). In the ERV group, 17 subjects (6.3%) experienced SAEs, compared with 16 
subjects (6.0) in the ERT group. None of the SA Es were considered related to treatment. Three 
subjects in the ERV group and 6 subjects in the ERT group died during the study. An equal 
percentage of subjects (1.9%) discontinued study drug due to a treatment -related TEAE . 
 
6.3.3 Phase 3 Study in Subjects with cUTI (TP -434-010) 
The efficacy of an IV-to-PO transition  regimen  eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI was 
studied in a phase 3, randomized , double -blind, double -dummy, multicenter, prospective study 
comparing eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg q24h IV followed by 2 00 mg q12h PO [ERV]) with 
levofloxacin (750 mg q24h IV followed by 750 mg q24h PO [LEV]) in subjects with cUTI. A 
total of [ADDRESS_1028673]-
hoc analys es suggested that lower -then-expected eravacycline exposures during PO 
administration were responsible fo r the failure to meet the primary endpoint. Outcomes at earlier 
timepoints and among subjects who received only IV eravacycline (did not transition to PO) all 
favored eravacycline, supporting the efficacy of IV eravacycline in the treatment of cUTI.  
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028674] 
commonly reported TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders, including nausea ( 18.0% and 3.1% in 
the ERV and LEV groups, respectively) and vomiting ( 7.3% and 1.3% in the ERV and LEV 
groups, respectively). These events rarely led to study drug discontinuation. In the ERV group, 
1.5% experienced SAEs, compared with 1.3% in the LEV group. None of the SAEs in the ERV 
group were considered related to treatment.  
6.3.4 Summary of Known  and Potential Risks  
Eravacycline  is related to tetracyclines, a well -known class of antibiotics that has been utilized 
for over 50 years.  
The overall risk to the subjects  of the present study is deemed to be acceptable, as indicated by 
[CONTACT_751320], the initial p hase 1 studies , the ph ase 2 cIAI 
study , and the phase 3 cIAI and cUTI studies .  As expected for this class of antibiotics, tra nsient 
gastrointestinal adverse  events of mild to moderate intensity were observed at the higher dose 
levels  in the p hase 1 studies .  Low levels of nausea and vomiting  were observed in the cIAI 
phase 2 study  and phase 3 studies . Higher levels of nausea and  vomiting  were seen in the phase 3 
cUTI study; however, few events led to discontinuation of study drug . 
Infusion site related adverse events  (eg, pain, discomfort, and superficial phlebitis)  were 
observed in the phase 1 MAD study.  The eravacycline  concen tration was reduced by 25 -50% in 
the phase 2 cIAI study, and the repo rted incidence of infusion site related adverse events  was 
greatly reduced . Low levels of infusion site related adverse events were observed in the phase 3 
cIAI and cUTI studies.  
In subjects with higher risk for poor outcomes from infections [ie, auto -immune syndrome or 
Drug Reaction with Eosinophila and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) syndrome]  the investigator 
should carefully review the inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the appr opriate enrollment 
of subjects.  Clostridium difficile  associated infections are seen with all antibiotics.  Care should 
be taken in subjects enrolled in this clinical study, any subject that has signs or symptoms of 
Clostridium difficile  (eg, diarrhea or abdominal pain ) should be evaluated for this infection.  
Please refer to the latest version of the eravacycline IB and the meropenem  package insert  for 
additional information on eravacycline  and meropenem , respectively . 
6.4 Dosing Rationale  
Two doses of  eravacy cline were evaluated  in the phase 2 cIAI study based on tolerability and 
steady -state AUC s achieved in healthy volunteers in the phase 1 MAD stud y, and the clinical 
response  rates for both doses were similar to the comparator, ertapenem.  The eravacycline 1.0 
mg/kg  (up to a maximum of 150 mg)  q12h dose was selected  for the phase 3 cIAI study 
(TP-434-008), since this dose provided higher AUCs and acceptable tolerability.  As the efficacy 
of IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI was confirmed in TP -434-008 study, t he 
eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h dose has been  selected  (with no  maximum dose ) for this study.   
 
The comparator, meropenem , was chosen because it is approved by [CONTACT_751321].  It will be given at the recommended dose of 1 g 
q8h for an expected  minimum of four 24 -h dosing cycles .

8. STUDY DESIGN  
8.1 Number of Subjects  
The planned study enrollment is  approximately 466 subjects . For this study, enrollment occurs at 
the time of randomization , and it is expected that more subjects  will be screened than enrolled 
into the study .  This sample size was calculated as described in Section 14.2.3  based on the  
expectation that 68.75 % of subjects  will have a baseline pathogen identified and be included in 
the micro -ITT population.   
A pre-specified assessment of the actual number of subjects in the micro -ITT population was 
made following completion of the 250th subject.  This assessment was performed  using data 
blinded to treatment.   Since there was less than the expected proportion of subjects in the  micro -
ITT population, the sample size was increased to a target of approximately 466 to provide a 
sufficient number of evaluable subjects.  
8.2 Study Design  
This is a phase 3 , randomized, double -blind, double -dummy, multicenter, prospectiv e study to 
assess the efficacy , safety , and PK of eravacycline  compared with  meropenem .  Dosing in the 
study arms is described in the Table 1 below.

Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028678] approximately 6 -8 weeks.  
Foreseen treatment duration at study entry  is expected to  be a minimum of four 24 -h dosing 
cycles , (ie, in accordance with IDSA Guidelines  and the Schedule of Assessments  (SOA) for 
study drug  administration ).  However, study drug  may be discontinued at the discretion of the 
investigator  at any time .  Study drug  treatment should be stopped when symptoms of cIAI  have 
resolved  or there is treatment failure .  A review of subjects  requiring longer than 7 dosing cycles  
is required  with the Medical Monitor . (Refer to Section 10.3.4  Guidance to Investigators for 
Determining When to End Therapy).

Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017  
 
Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 29 of 58 10.1.2  Abdominal Examination  
A thorough clinical examination of the abdomen  is to be performed  at specif ied time points . 
Abdominal pain, tenderness to palpation, rebound tenderness, guarding, mass, and ascites will 
be assessed and  severity  graded as none, mild, moderate , or severe according to the following 
definitions:  
None:  No signs or symptoms  
Mild:  Aware ness of signs and symptoms, but easily tolerated  
Moderate:  Signs or symptoms of enough intensity to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe:  Signs and symptoms of enough intensity that incapacitate and interfere with 
usual activity  
Other pertinent fi ndings should be recorded , including inability to tolerate oral or enteral intake 
and presence or absence of ileus . 
 
The clinical abdominal examination will include an assessment of the surgical wound (if 
applicable).  The surgical wound examination will assess signs of infection such as : skin 
erythema, induration, tenderness, warmth to touch, fluctuance, swelling , and superficial wound 
pain.  If signs of infection are present, findings will be recorded and grade d as mild, moderate , 
or sev ere according to the definitions above.  If present, the nature of any discharge ( eg, 
purulent, serous, bloody, etc.) will be assessed and the drainage cultured  if clinically indicated . 
10.1.3  Safety Lab oratory Tests  
Safety lab oratory tests  for this study  (chemis try, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis ) are to 
be performed by a  central laboratory, and only values from the central laboratory are to be 
entered into the  laboratory section of the study database .  Values fr om local laboratories may be 
used to deter mine eligibility for study enrollment  and as the basis for  clinical decisions .  See 
Appendix 2: Central  Safety Laboratory Tests  for the complete list of safety laboratory tests.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1028693]  in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_751301].  
10.1.5  Microbiologic Specimen Coll ection  
Appropriate aerobic and anaerobic specimens for culture at the time of the initial surgical 
procedure (or during re -intervention in the case of prior treatment failures) should be collected 
from the site of infection and directly inoculated into culture me dia during the surgical 
intervention ; microbiologic specimens collected during routine operative care prior to subject 
consent may be used for study purposes .  For subjects that enter the study as a documented cIAI 
treatment failure ( ie, with a known basel ine pathogen), reasonable attempts should be made to 
provide the baseline isolates to the central laboratory.   The specimens should be representative of 
the material associated with the clinical infection.  Every effort should be made to collect 
specimens via a tissue biopsy  or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].  Samples collected by [CONTACT_751324][INVESTIGATOR_751302] .  Samples collected from superficial 
swabs and abdominal drains are not allowed.  These specimens will be cultured and the species 
will be identified by [CONTACT_751325].  All purified isolate(s) will be sent to a 
central, reference laboratory at time points determined by [CONTACT_751326], Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017

manual (s) for this study.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1028694] erile venipuncture sites 
prior to initiation of clinical trial drug therapy .  Upon knowledge of a positive culture for a 
pathogen, blood cultures should be repeated until sterile (ie, both sets of cultures from two 
separate venipuncture sites are negative for pathogens) through the FU visit.  If baselin e cultures 
are negative, follow -up cultures should be obtained only if clinically indicated (eg, signs and 
symptoms of persistence, relapse, or new infection).       
These specimens will be cultured and the sp ecies will be identified by [CONTACT_751327].  All purified pathogen(s) will be sent to a central reference laboratory at time points 
determined by [CONTACT_751328], including to study drugs. Specific instructions for sample collection, 
processing, and shipment can be found in the laboratory manual(s) for this study.  
10.1.7  Radiologic Assessment  
Radiologic evaluation may be performed as part of the pre -operative diagnos is or if surgical 
re-intervention is clinically indicated.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_751303] . 
NOTE: If randomization is planned pre -operatively then radiographic evidence congruent with 
the diagnosis of cIAI is required.  
10.1.8  Clinical Response  
Clinical outcome assessment s will be made at the EOT, TOC , and FU visits.  Clinical responses 
will be classified as Clinical  Cure, Clinical F ailure,  or Indeterminate /Missing  based on clinical 
outcomes.  A favorable clinical response is “ Clinical  Cure.” 
Clinical response categories  are defined below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Cure  
Clinical Cure is defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms 
of the index infection  such that  no additional antibacterial therapy , surgical , or radiological 
intervention  (eg, an ultrasound guided drainage)  is required.   Routine imaging procedures ( eg, an 
investigational ultrasound) are not considered radiological interventions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Failure  
Subjects  are classified as a Clinical Failure based on:  
▪ Death related to cIAI  
▪ Persistence of clinical symptoms of cIAI  
▪ Unplanned  surgical procedures or percutaneous drainage procedures  for complication or 
recurrence of cIAI

Clinical Failures are to be documented by [CONTACT_751329], if feasible.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Indeterminate /Missing  
If the subject’s outcome is neither Clinical Cure nor Clinical Failure then the outcome should be 
listed as “Indeterminate /Missing .”  The reason for a n “Indeterminate /Missing ” des ignation must 
be provided .  Study data are listed as “Indeterminate/Missing” if the Investigator did not 
complete an assessment or if the study visit was not conducted.  Deaths not related to cIAI will 
be considered “Indeterminate/Missing.”

Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 36 of 58 Figure 1: Study Drug Infusion Scheme of a [ADDRESS_1028708] Dose of the dosing cycle. (See Figure 1 above ) 
The interval between the 1st Doses of a djacent  24-h dosing cycle can be reduced by [CONTACT_8622] [ADDRESS_1028709] 24 -h dosing cycle, the allowable administration window  
for each infusion  is ± [ADDRESS_1028710] has  received one i nfusion 
of study drug and its placebo -matched infusion.  
10.3.2  Meropenem and Meropenem -Matched Placebo Dose Adjustment  
Meropenem dosing should be reduced in subjects with a creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min or 
less in accordance with the dosage and  administration instructions found in the meropenem 
package insert.  
While a creatinine clearance of ≤ 50 mL/min is exclusionary at Screening ; it is possible that a 
subject’s creatinine clearance  may change while on study.  Investigators are instructed to l ocally 
calculate creatinine clearance  at the Screening Visit, Dose Cycle 1 through Dose Cycle 4, and 
every three 24 -h dosing cycles thereafter while on study drug  (eg, Dose Cycle 7, Dose Cycle 10, 
and Dose Cycle 13).  
If at any time after Screening the loca lly calculated creatinine clearance is ≤ 50 mL/min then the 
subject’s meropenem and/or meropenem -matched placebo must be dose-adjusted  in accordance 
with the meropenem package insert.  Thereafter, each time the creatinine clearance is calculated 
locally th e meropenem and/or meropenem -matched placebo must be dose-adjusted in accordance 
with the meropenem package insert.  Specific instructions for the dose adjustments of 
meropenem and/or meropenem -matched placebo  are included in the meropenem package insert 
and the Pharmacy Manual for this study . 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1028711] be started as soon as 
possible.  No infusion should be “missed” regardless of how long it may have been delayed.  
A complete dose cycle is defined as all five doses for a dosing cycle . 
Subjects  will be considered compliant with study drug treatment  if they do not miss more than 
20% of the expect ed study drug infusion s, as defined by  [CONTACT_751331].   
10.3.4  Guidance to Investigators for Determining When to End Th erapy  
In accordance with guidelines, subjects  are expected to  remain on study drug treatment for a 
minimum of four 24 -h dosing cycles  (unless subject  is a treatment failure  or cure ) and for a 
maximum of 14 dosing cycles .  Study drug treatment should be con tinued  until resolution of 
infection signs and symptoms  is documented,  such as:  
▪ Maximum temperature ( oral, rectal, tympanic, or by [CONTACT_751332] ) has been  < 100.4˚F 
/ 38˚C for 24 -h  
▪ Improvement of abdominal signs and symptoms presenting at study entry  
▪ A return of bowel function and restoration of oral/enteral intake  
Any subject  requiring longer than seven 24 -h dosing cycles of study drug therapy should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor .     
10.4 Specific Restrictions/Requirements  
Study drug must only be administered while subjects  are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] .  All subjects  must have an 
EOT assessment, and return to investigational site s for TOC and FU assessments  unless they 
have withdrawn consent .   
10.4.1  Avoidance of Pregnancy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Instructions for Male Subjects  
There is no information on the  effects of eravacycline  on the development of the  fetus in 
humans. Therefore, it is important t hat the partners of male subjects  do not  become pregnant 
during the study and for a total period of  [ADDRESS_1028712] dose 
of study drug.  
Subjects should avoid fathering a child by [CONTACT_751333].  
Since there is a risk of drug bei ng secreted in the ejaculate, subjects (including men who  have 
had vasectomies) whose partners are currently pregnant should use barrier methods  for the  
duration of the study and for two weeks afterwards. This is to ensure that the  fetus is not exposed 
to the investigational product in the ejaculate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Instructions for Female Subjects  
Females of childbearing potential are eligible for enrollment in this study.  There is no  
information on the  effects of eravacycline  on the development of the  fetus in humans. Th erefore, 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028713]  commit to either: (1) Using at least two medically 
accepted, effective methods of birth control (eg, condom, spermicidal gel, oral contraceptive, 
indwelling intrauterine device, hormonal implant /patch, injections, approved cervical ring) 
during study dru g dosing and for [ADDRESS_1028714] study drug dose, or  (2) sexual 
abstinence . 
10.4.2  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is considered an immediately reportable event  (but not an adverse event) , and the 
investigator will record information concerning the pregnancy on the ap propriate form and 
submit it to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_1028715]’s pregnancy.  Study drug 
administration will be stopped in a ny female subject who becomes pregnant while participating , 
and the subject  will be  followed to determine t he outcome of the pregnancy. All pregnancies in 
the female partners of male subjects  receiving at least one dose of eravacycline will be recorded 
from first dose to the last study visit . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up in the Event of a Pregnancy  
The ethics committee and the Sp onsor will be informed  of all pregnancies in study subjects  and 
in partners of male subjects . 
The subject will be asked to provide information on the outcome of the pregnancy,  including 
premature termination should the case arise.  Spontan eous miscarriage s and congenital 
abnormalities will be reported as serious adverse  events (SAEs).  Information on the status of the 
mother and child will be forwarded to the Medical Monitor  or designee . Generally, follow  up 
will be in accordance with regulatory guidance and  at least 6 -8 weeks after the estimated 
delivery date. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
10.5 Study Discontinuation/Termination Criteria  
The study Sponsor reserves the right to terminate this clinical study or participation of an 
investigative site at any time.  Reasons for study discontinuation/ termination may include, but 
are not limited to, the following:  
1. Incidence and/or severity and composition of AEs in this or other studies indicate a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
2. Sponsor’s decision to discontinue investigation in a specific therapeutic area  
3. Subject  enrollment is unsatisfactory  
4. An investigator req uests to withdraw from participation  
5. Serious and/or persistent noncompliance by [CONTACT_135770], clinical 
research agreement, Form FDA 1572, or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the 
study  
6. IRB/ IEC decision to terminate or sus pend approval for the in vestigation or an investigator  
7. Untimely input of data into eCRFs  
8. Low pathogen recovery rate from microbiologic samples

Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 39 of 58 11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Quality Control  
11.1.1  Monitoring  
The Sponsor, or designee(s), will monitor the st udy for compliance to the protocol, applicable laws 
and regulations, and Good Clinical Practice.  The monitor(s) will verify data on the electronic case 
report form versus source data.  The monitor is also responsible for ensuring that the proper records 
are maintained.  Monitoring reports will be issued for each monitoring visit.  
11.2 Quality Assurance  
Quality assurance personnel may audit the clinical trial sites  and/or study -related materials at any 
time during the study.  
12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Safety will be a ssessed through AEs, physical examinations, vital signs,  ECGs, and the 
collection of central laboratory data ( ie, chemistry, hematology, coagulation , and urinalysis ). The 
Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_751305], documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.  
12.[ADDRESS_1028716] ’s study participation  
(defined as after the time of initial informed consent) .  This would include any side effect, injury, 
toxicity, sensitivity reaction, intercurrent illness, or s udden death.  A pre -existing condition is 
one that is present at study entry  and is reported as part of the subject ’s medical history.  It 
should be reported as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens 
during study drug treatment.  Subjects  should be instructed to report all AEs to the investigator  or 
study staff .  Adverse events must be appropriately documented in the subject ’s original source 
documents and entered into the  eCRF .  Investigators should report syndromes rather than list 
symptoms.  Treatment failure (e.g. recurrent cIAI) is not considered an AE.  
12.1.2  Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a ny untoward and unintended response in a subject to an 
investigational medicinal product which is related to any dose administered to that subject . 
12.1.3  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  Life -threatening mean s that the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred  (ie, it does not include a reaction which hypothetically 
might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form ). 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017  
 
Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 40 of 58 • Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5183] o f existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to study entry, are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the  trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected manner during the study ( eg, surgery performed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s  ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  An important medical event is an event that may not result 
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_751306] S AE 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospa sm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Clarification should be made between the terms “serious”  and “severe” since the terms ARE 
NOT synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a 
specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, 
may be of relatively minor medic al significance (such as a severe headache).  This is NOT the 
same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria described above, 
and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning.  A 
severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For example, persistent nausea of 
several hours duration may be considered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a 
stroke resulting in only a minor degree of disability may be consider ed mild, but would be 
defined as an SAE based on the above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide 
for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Events that result from lack of efficacy of study drug (eg, treatment failure , ongoing cIAIs, 
wound infections requiring antibiotics, recurrence of abscesses ) are not considered SAEs and as 
such prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s, etc. for these events will not be considered SAEs.  
12.1.4  Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
An adverse reaction is ‘unexpected’ if it s nature and severity are not consistent with the 
information about the medicinal product  in question  set out in the most recent Investigator’s 
Brochure relating to the trial in question  or the product information for meropenem . 
12.[ADDRESS_1028717] and/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF  startin g from the time of initial informed 
consent .  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical findings 
is considered an AE and must be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF  starting from the 
time of initial informe d consent .  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028718] be reported 
by [CONTACT_751334] /contract research 
organization ( CRO ) within 24-h from the point in time when the Investigator becomes aware of 
the SAE.  In addition all SAEs, including all deaths, which occur  from the time of signing of the 
inform ed consent  up to and including [ADDRESS_1028719] 
be reported whether or not considered causally related to the study dru g.  The information 
collected will include a minimum of the following: Subject number, a narrative description of the 
event and an assessment by [CONTACT_751335] .  Follow -up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_751336] .  Detailed instructions for the collecting and reporting of SAEs will be 
provided in the Investigator Site File.  
If there are serious, unexpected ADRs  associated with the use of the study drug, the Sponsor or 
its designated CRO  will notify the appropriate regulatory agency(ies) and all participating 
Investigators on an expedited basis (7 days for fatal or life -threatening serious, unexpected 
ADRs ; 15 days for all other serious, unexpected ADRs ).  The Sponsor has delegated the 
responsibility to promptly notify the IRB/IEC  of all unexpected serious ADRs  involving risk to 
human subjects in accordance with the rules and regulations of the IRB/IEC to the Principal 
Investigator.  
An unexpected event is one that is not reported in the IB. 
Reporting of SAEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
All SAEs must be reported to the designated CRO within 24 -h of the investigational site’s 
knowledge of the occurrence.  Each investigational site will submit the  SAE information  to the 
CRO .   
The SAE information transmitted  to the CRO will include the following (as available):  
▪ Subject  ID, investigator name, and site number  
▪ SAE information: event term, onset date, severity, and casual relationship  
▪ Basic demographic information ( eg, age, gender, weight, etc.) 
▪ The outcomes attributable to the event [eg, death, a life -threatening adverse drug 
experience, in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a 
persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity, other important medical event(s )] 
▪ A summary of relevant test results, pertinent laboratory data, and any other relevant 
medical history  
▪ The first and last dates of study drug administration  
▪ A statement whether study drug was discontinued o r study drug administration schedule 
was modified  
▪ A statement whether event recurred after reintroduction of study drug if administration had 
been discontinued or withheld  
▪ Supplemental information may include the following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]: laboratory resu lts, 
radiology reports, progress notes, admission and emergency room notes, 
holding/observation notes, discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and death certificates  
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028720] the investigational site to solicit 
additional information or follow -up on the event.  Investigational sites will be provided with 
detailed instructions on the procedures for transmitting SAE s to the CRO . 
For regulatory purposes, initial reports of serious ADRs  should be transmitted within the 
prescribed time frame as long as the following minimum information is available: subject  
identification, suspect study drug, reporting source, and an event or outcome that can be 
identified a s being both serious and unexpected for which, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], there is a 
suspected causal relationship.   
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) which is fatal or life -threatening must 
be reported to the competent authority and ethics committee immediately (within 7 days) after 
the Sponsor bec omes  aware of the event.  Any additional information must be reported within 
eight days of sending the first report.  
A S[LOCATION_003]R which is not fatal or life -threatening must be reported to t he competent authority and 
ethics committee as soon as possible (within 15 days) after the Sponsor becomes aware of the 
event.  
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs occurring at the site will be entered into the European database established in 
accordance with Article 11 of the EU C linical Trials Directive.  
12.3 Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE will be categorized using the following criteria:  
Mild  AE usually transient and requires no special treatment and does not interfere with 
the subject ’s daily activities.  
Moderate  AE produces a low level of inconvenience to the subject  and may interfere with 
daily activities.  These events are usually ameliora ted by [CONTACT_39508].  
Severe  AE interrupts daily activity and requires systemic drug therapy or other medical 
treatment.  
Key: AE = adverse event  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1028721] make an assessment of the relationship of the event 
to the study drug using the following scale:  
Not R elated : An event that is definitely not  associated with study drug administration and is 
judged clearly due to causes other than the study drug.  
Unlikely Related : An event that follows a temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug, such that , a relationship is not likely and could b e reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423] 's 
clinical state , or other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017  
 
Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 43 of 58 Possibly Related : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug, but that , may be due to another cau se and could also be reasonably explained by 
[CONTACT_423] 's clinical state , or other modes of therapy administered to the subject . 
Probably Related : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug, that is not easi ly explained by [CONTACT_5748]  (such as , known characteristics of 
the subject ’s clinical state or other treatment ) and is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_751307] ( ie, de-challenge , if applicable ). 
Definitely Related : An event that is clearly associated with study drug administration.   
In the event of death, the cause of death should be recorded as the AE.  “Death” is an outcome 
and is NOT the AE.  The only exception is “sudden death” when the cause is unknown.  
12.[ADDRESS_1028722] Abnormalities  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings that are detected during the study or are 
present at baseline and significantly worsen will be reported as adverse events or SAEs. The 
Investigator will exercise his or her medica l and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
 
Clinical significance  is at the discretion of the Investigator and  may be defined as those findings 
which:  
• Are directly responsible for discontinuation from the stu dy, 
• Require treatment or  other therapeutic intervention,  
• Require further monitoring, or  
• Require further diagnostic evaluation (other than repeat of the same test to confirm the 
abnormality).  
 
All abnormal laboratory values considered to be  clinically significant  will be recorde d on the 
adverse event  page of the eCRF. Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the 
clinical study will be followed until r epeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer 
clinically significant.  
 
All central  laboratory data generated by [CONTACT_751337] . 
Throughout this study, subjects  will have samples sent to local  laboratories  and to the central 
laboratory.  Only the values from the samples sent to the central laboratory will be captured in 
the study  database and used for the safety analysis.  Investigators may report AEs based upon 
local laboratory values.  In this event, the actual value and the normal range for the local 
laboratory should be recorded on the AE form.  
12.6 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) and SAEs determined not to be study drug 
related (ie, not related and unlikely rel ated) will be followed through the FU visit and be noted as 
“continuing” if not resolved at this visit.  Any SAE that is determined to be study drug related 
(possibly , probably , or definitely  related) will be followed to resolution or stabilization.  Subjects 
will be referred to their primary care doctor for further follow -up as needed post -study.  
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017  
 
Version  2.0 Confidential  Page 44 of 58 The outcome of AEs will be rated as:  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovering/Resolving  
• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  • Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
13. EVALUATION OF EFFICA CY 
13.1 Analysis Populations  
The following definitions  will be used in assigning subjects into analysis  populations : 
• Intent -to-treat (ITT) population – all subjects who are randomized  
• All Treated (MITT) Population - all randomized subjects who receive any amount of study 
drug. Analyses in this population are based on the treatment arm the subject was 
randomized to.  
• Safety Population - all randomized subjects who receive any amount of study drug. 
Analyses in this populatio n are based on the treatment the subject actually received.  
• Microbiological intent -to-treat (micro -ITT) population – all randomized subjects who have 
at least one baseline bacterial pathogen that cause s cIAI and against  which the 
investigational drug has in vitro antibacterial activity  
• Clinically evaluable (CE) – all subjects in the ITT population who meet key 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and follow other important components of the trial  
• Microbiologically evaluable (ME) – all subjects in the micro -ITT popu lation who meet key 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and follow other important components of the trial  
 
13.2 Efficacy Evaluations  
The primary efficacy evaluation, clinical response at the TOC visit, will be con ducted in the 
micro -ITT population.  
The following seco ndary evaluations will be performed:  
▪ Clinical response at EOT , TOC, and FU visits in the following populations:  
- ITT 
- MITT  
- CE 
- Micro -ITT (EOT and FU)  
- ME 
▪ Microbiologic responses at EOT and TOC visits in the following populations:  
- Micro -ITT  
- ME 
▪ PK parameters after eravacycline  infusion , including  
- Cmax, Tmax, AUC 0-12

Version 2.0 Confidential  Page 45 of 58  
13.2.1  Clinical Response  
Clinical outcome assessment s will be made at the EOT, TOC , and FU visits.  Clinical response 
will be classified by [CONTACT_751338], Clinical F ailure, or Indeterminate /Missing .  
Subjects who are assessed as a Clinical Failure at the EOT Visit will have the failure carried 
forward to the TOC Visit. Subjects who are assessed as a Clinical Failure at the TOC Visit will 
have the failure carried forwa rd to the FU Visit.  For those subjects reviewed by [CONTACT_751339]  (SAC)  (see Section 14.2.5 ), the committee assessment of cli nical 
response will be  used for analysis.  A favorable clinical response is “ Clinical C ure”.   
13.2.2  Per Pathogen Microbiological Outcomes  
Microbiological outcome assessments will be made at the EOT and TOC visits.  
Per-pathogen microbiologic response categories are eradication, presumptive eradication, 
persistence, persistence with decreased susceptibility, presumed persistence, and 
indeterminate /missing  and are defined as follows:  
• Eradication  – Absence of causative organism from an appropriately obtai ned specimen at 
the site of infection at each timepoint  
• Presumptive eradication – Absence of material to culture in a subject who has responded 
clinically to treatment (clinical cure)  
• Persistence – Continued presence of the original pathogen in cultures fr om the original 
site of infection or blood culture obtained during or upon completion of therapy   
• Persistence with decreased susceptibility – Continued presence of the original pathogen 
in cultures from the original site of infection obtained during or upo n completion of 
therapy, and the MIC for the study drug received of the pathogen is > 2 -fold (as least 2 
dilutions) higher than that of the original isolate  
• Presumed persistence – Absence of material to culture in a subject who is given 
additional antibiot ics to treat the study entry cIAI (clinical failure)  
• Indeterminate /Missing  – Culture not obtained and clinical response is indeterminate /

for any pathogen is unfavorable (persistence, persistence with decreased susceptibility or 
presumed persistence), the subject will be considered to have an unfavorable per -subject 
microbiologic response.  
14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
A detailed Statistical  Analysis Plan (SAP) will be used to guide the analysis and reporting of data 
collected in this study.   
14.1 Data Collection  and Processing  
An IWRS will be used to allocate treatment assignments to subjects .  Creation and validation of 
the clinical database, d ata entry, data management, and transfer of central laboratory data will be 
conducted in accordance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (C FR) Part 11 and the Guidance 
for Industry on Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials.  
eCRFs will be completed for  all randomized subjects. Please refer to the CRF Completion 
Guidelines for instructions on which eCRFs will be completed for subjects  who are randomized 
but not treated.  
14.2 Statistical  Methodology  
All data collected in this study will be presented in data l istings and, where indicated, tabulated 
in summary tables.  Data will be presented and summarized using the SAS System (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC).  
Continuous variables will be summarized with the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, median,  minimum, and maximum.   
Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages.  Percentages will be 
based on non -missing data unless specified otherwise.   
Except where indicated in the SAP, Baseline  is defined as the closest value pri or to the start of 
treatment with study drug.  
14.2.1  Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy outcome measure is clinical response at the TOC Visit (incorporating the 
SAC assessment) in the micro -ITT population. The number and percentage of subjects in each 
treatme nt group defined as a clinical cure, clinical failure , and indeterminate /missing  will be 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017  
 
Version 2.0 Confidential  Page 47 of 58 tabulated. A 2 -sided 95% CI for the observed difference in clinical cure rates (eravacycline 
treatment group minus meropenem treatment group) will be calculated using the method without 
stratification of Miettinen and Nurminen.  If the lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in 
clinical cure rates in the micro -ITT population exceeds -12.5%, then non -inferiority of 
eravacycline to meropenem will be declared.  The pr imary efficacy outcome will also be 
assessed across the randomization stratification factor of primary site of infection.  For each site 
of infection stratum, a 2 -sided 95% CI for the observed difference in clinical cure rates at  the 
TOC Visit will be calc ulated  for the micro -ITT population. The  number and percentage of 
subjects in each treatment group with a secondary efficacy outcome (the SAC assessment of 
clinical response will be used, if available) of clinical cure, clinical failure , and 
indeterminate /missing  will be presented for the following time points and analysis populations:  
• EOT Visit  – ITT, MITT, CE, micro -ITT and ME populations  
• TOC Visit  – ITT, MITT, CE and ME populations  
• FU Visit  – ITT, MITT, CE, micro -ITT and ME populations  
Two-sided 95% unstratified  CIs will be constructed for the observed difference in the clinical 
cure rates between the treatment groups for descriptive purposes ; no conclusion of NI will be 
made. Analyses at the TOC Visit will also b e presented by [CONTACT_751340]. 
Per-subject microbiological response will be summarized as favorable (eradicated, presumed 
eradicated), unfavorable (persistence, persistence with decreased susceptibility, presumed 
persistence) , and indeterminate /missing  at the EOT and TOC Visits in t he Micro -ITT and ME 
Populations. Two -sided 9 5% unstratified CIs will be constructed for the observed difference in 
the rates of favorable response between the treatment groups for descriptive purposes; no 
conclusion of NI will be made . 
Microbiologic respon se by [CONTACT_751341] a favorable microbiologic response (eradication or presumed eradication) at the TOC Visit 
for each pathogen isolated at baseline. The number and percentage of subjects in each tr eatment 
group with a microbiologic favorable outcome will be tabulated for the micro -ITT and ME 
populations.  
14.2.2  Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety population.   
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be coded using a current versio n of MedDRA.  Summary 
tables will be provided for all treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  A treatment -
emergent AE is defined as any AE that newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in 
severity following initiation of study drug.  The num ber and percentage of subjects reporting a 
TEAE in each treatment group will be tabulated by [CONTACT_6657]; by 
[CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and severity; and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and 
relationship to study dr ug. The number and percentage of subjects reporting a SAE and reporting 
a TEAE leading to premature discontinuation of study drug in each treatment group will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_6657]. For all analyses of TEAEs, if the same 
AE (based on preferred term) is reported for the same subject more than once, the AE is counted 
only once for that preferred term and at the highest severity and strongest relationship to study 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-[ADDRESS_1028724] a two grade increase from baseline (based on 
DMID criteria) will be summarized by [CONTACT_19480] m. 
Descriptive statistics of the change from baseline for vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_224825]. Abnormal values, identified by [CONTACT_751342], will 
be summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG parameters at  baseline and the EOT Visit, and the change from 
baseline will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  QTcB at the EOT Visit and the increase from 
baseline for QTcB will be categorized and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
14.2.3  Sample Size Considerations  
This study is designed to demonstrate non -inferiority of 1.0 mg/kg q12h eravacycline to 
meropenem in the primary outcome measure of clinical response at the TOC Visit in the micro -
ITT Population.  An NI margin of 12.5% will be used , which is based on histo rical data 
regarding the treatment effect of antibiotics  and the results of the previously completed 
eravacycline phase 3 cIAI study .  A 12.5% NI margin for the outcome measure of clinical 
response is robust and can sufficiently confirm a clinically meanin gful treatment effect of 
eravacycline in the treatment of cIAI.   
The sample size calculation is based on ensuring sufficient power for the primary efficacy 
outcome for the FDA as well as the primary efficacy outcome for the EMA (which are secondary 
effica cy outcomes for the FDA).  Estimations of cure rates and numbers of subjects in the micro -
ITT population come from the recent phase 3 study with eravacycline in cIAI in which 
ertapenem was used as the comparator.  Clinical cure rates in the micro -ITT popul ation at the 
TOC Visit were 86.8% and 87.6% in the eravacycline and ertapenem  groups, respectively, with 
82.4% of randomized subjects included in the micro -ITT population.  Thus, it is reasonable to 
assume that the true rate of clinical cure at the TOC Vis it will be at least 84% in the eravacycline 
group and 85% in the meropenem group . Based upon the results of the pre -specified blinded 
assessment of the actual number of subjects in the micro -ITT population following completion of 
the 250th subject, the eva luability rate is assumed to be 68.75%.  
Using a 12.5% non -inferiority margin, one -sided alpha of 0.025, 80% power, response rates of 
84% in the eravacycline group and 85% in the meropenem group , and the methodology of 
Farrington and Manning, a total of 161 subjects per arm in the micro -ITT population is required. 
A sample size of approximately 466 randomized subjects should provide sufficient numbers for 
this study, assuming 68.75 % of enrolled subjects will meet the requirements for inclusion in the 
micro -ITT population.  
For the EMA, the rates of clinical cure in the phase 3 study were approximately 87% in the 
MITT population and 93% in the CE -TOC population.   Assuming clinical cure rates of 84% in 
the eravacycline group and 85% in the meropenem grou p in the MITT population and 89% in the 
eravacycline group and 90% in the meropenem group in the CE -TOC population, an NI margin 
of 12.5%, a one -sided alpha of 0.025, evaluability rates of  95% for the MITT population and 
Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Clinical Protocol TP -434-025 20 March 2017  
 
Version 2.0 Confidential  Page 49 of 58 85% for the CE -TOC population, and the methodology of Farrington and Manning, there is  more 
than 90 % power in both the MITT population and the CE population to show non -inferiority  
with a sample size of 466 enrolled subjects .   
14.2.4  Handling of Missing Data  
Details of the handling of missing dat a will be provided in the SAP. For the primary and secondary 
outcome measures of clinical response, subjects will be defined as an indeterminate /missing  
response if the investigator cannot determine whether the subject is a clinical cure or failure, 
includ ing if the subject is lost to follow -up or misses the assessment.  By [CONTACT_108], subjects with 
an indeterminate /missing  response are included in the denominator in the microITT and MITT 
populations and thus, are analyzed in the same manner as clinical fai lures.  Subjects with an 
indeterminate /missing  response are excluded from the CE and ME populations.  For microbiologic 
response, if no post -baseline source specimen is obtained and the subject has an investigator's 
assessment of clinical response, the mic robiologic response is based on the investigator's 
assessment of clinical response.  A microbiologic response will be considered 
indeterminate /missing  only if the clinical response is indeterminate /missing . 
14.2.5  Surgical Adjudication Committee  (SAC)  
Adequate surgical source control is critical to the successful treatment of cIAIs.  An independent 
SAC will be established to review cases for all subjects classified as a clinical failure  at any visit  
and all subjects classified as clinical cure at TOC  or FU who undergo a second surgical 
procedure .   
The SAC will review these cases, assess the adequacy of surgical source control , evaluate the 
investigators’ clinical assessments , and either concur with the investigators’ assessment of 
clinical response or r e-classify the clinical response in accordance with the rules specified in the 
SAC Charter . 
For additional information regarding the composition of the committee, roles and responsibilities 
of its members, working procedures, and decision rules refer to th e SAC Charter .

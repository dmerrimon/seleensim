Describe the proposed subject population, including gender, race, ethnicity, language, and literacy.
We plan to recruit 48 family dyads (48 parents and 48 children) for this proposed study. One parent and one young child 
with autism per family will participate. Attempts will be made to recruit families across the [LOCATION_002] that represent 
the racial/ethnic diversity of the country.  All families will be English-speaking. Parents must be able to read and write.
Identify any criteria for subject inclusion or exclusion. If inclusion/exclusion criteria are based on gender, race, or 
ethnicity, explain rationale for restrictions.
Inclusion Criteria:
 
Child participants must (a) be between the ages of 
1.0
 and 
5.0
 years (
12
 and 
60
 months), (b) have an existing diagnosis 
of autism spectrum disorder, and (c) have parent endorsements of significant language delay as a major area of concern. 
Parent participants must be willing and able to read, complete intake and follow-up assessments, have regular access to 
an internet connected smartphone or tablet, complete the eight weekly PRT lessons, record and submit parent-child PRT 
videos, and review these videos on a weekly basis.
Exclusion Criteria:
 
Children with co-occurring significant medical conditions, seizures, and mental health concerns will be excluded. 
Because all training materials will only be available in English for this initial trial, non-English speaking families will also 
be excluded.  Families without access to a smartphone or tablet that can run the app and record video and those who do 
not have access to an internet connection will also be excluded.

Parents will use the project's smartphone application in their home in towns and cities across the [LOCATION_002]. 
Entered data and video recordings will be sent to UCSB for analysis.
PURPOSE:
 Provide a brief description of the purpose of the project in lay terms, including the specific study objectives, 
rationale, and hypotheses.
The majority of families in the [LOCATION_002] do not have access to adequate autism intervention services
. 
The 
development of smartphone apps designed to train parents in these strategies may help. The objective of this 
proposed clinical translational research project is to develop and evaluate self-directed smartphone app-based 
parent education programs designed to facilitate mass dissemination of a well-established, evidence-based autism 
treatment (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117215]).  It is hypothesized that one of the apps, which will feature video self-
modeling/ parent self-scoring components, will yield superior outcomes over the other app without these 
components.  
SPECIFIC AIMS
1.
Develop PRT smart-phone applications that combine existing instructional lessons and videos with video 
capture and video self-modeling/fidelity analysis functionality.
2.
Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_117216], utility, and preliminary outcome efficacy of 
these two app-based PRT programs as promising mechanisms to disseminate evidence-based autism 
intervention to the general public.
3.
Determine if a PRT app with video self-modeling/fidelity self-scoring and individualized feedback 
components yields superior gains in parent fidelity and child outcomes over the basic PRT app without this 
functionality as a means to evaluate mechanisms underlying rapid learning and mastery of PRT strategies.

Overview
 
This proposed project aims to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_117218], utility, and 
preliminary efficacy of two versions of a self-directed, smartphone app-based parent education program to teach 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117219] (social engagement and language 
use) in young children with autism. A PRT Manual is included in the attachments if HSC reviewers would like more 
information on this treatment model.  The programs will both focus on training parents in the well-established, 
evidence-based, manualized PRT early autism intervention, with the following manipulation:
 
1.
BASIC PRT PROGRAM: 
Parents complete 
[ADDRESS_130802] and submit a 
5
-minute video administering the PRT intervention with their child doing 
PRT after each lesson. 
Parents will then watch their video performance, but they will not score their 
own performance or receive individualized feedback based on this performance.
2.
ADAPTIVE PRT PROGRAM: 
Parents complete 
[ADDRESS_130803] and submit a 
5
-minute video administering the PRT intervention with their child 
doing PRT after each lesson. 
Parents will then review their video and self-score their PRT 
performance using a built-in fidelity scoring feature within the app.  At the end of scoring, the 
program will indicate areas of strength/weakness and provide feedback to improve their future PRT 
performance. 
A depi[INVESTIGATOR_98779] a PRT lesson and the app are in the attachment section.
 
This adaptive program is intended to remedy identified shortcomings of standard self-directed training programs 
with the introduction of video self-modeling/individualized instructional components that allow parents to (a)

fidelity of implementation, and (c) access an adaptive curriculum of lessons based on identified fidelity 
shortcomings or parent-selected review topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/questions.
 
Type of Clinical Trial
 
This proposed project will utilize a double-blind randomized clinical trial design to compare the two PRT mobile 
applications on parent and child outcome measures. Parents and researchers will both be blinded to the PRT app 
condition of each family.
 
Research Partners
Our research team will be partnering with Novacoast, Inc., a Santa Barbara software company specializing in 
secure, cloud-based software-as-a-service solutions. We will combine our existing online PRT curriculum with their 
encrypted video upload and fidelity coding software into a single user-friendly smartphone/tablet application. 
Videos that are uploaded by [CONTACT_117224].
 
Procedure
After completing informed consent, parents complete an initial online battery of intake assessments (see measures 
below). These online surveys are completed through a provided link to the online test companies' secure, 
encrypted testing website, which the study researchers can later access using a username [CONTACT_117241]-app link to a secure UCSB Qualtrics form. Personally 
Identifiable Health Information will include parent names, child names, child autism and co-occuring disorder 
diagnoses, email, phone, zip code, city, and state.  Families will be randomly assigned to adaptive or standard 
(control) PRT application groups for the 
[ADDRESS_130805] and upload a weekly 
5
-minute parent-child PRT session after each lesson. 
Research assistants (also masked to participant study condition) will use Noldus Observer coding software to 
score PRT fidelity of implementation (Primary Outcome) and child social communication behaviors (Secondary 
Outcomes): prompted and unprompted words, eye contact, and directed positive affect for each participant 
family

s submitted videos (intake, after PRT lessons 
1-8
, and at follow-up 
2
 months after the final lesson). Online 
child development surveys (Secondary Outcomes) will also be administered at intake and follow-up (
[ADDRESS_130806] PRT lesson).
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117220]-based autism intervention that combines motivational strategies and 
behavioral principles into a single comprehensive model (Gengoux et al, 2019; Verschuur et al, 2014).  It 
leverages child selected/preferred activities, task variation, clear learning prompts, contingent reinforcement of 
language attempts, logically related reinforcers, and a combination of mastered and new learning tasks to improve 
child language use and social engagement.  It is a play-based approach that is delivered in natural environments 
and emphasizes parent education (Verschuur, Huskens, & Didden, 2019). A PRT manual and fidelity scoring guide 
are included in the attachment section.
 
The app-based PRT parent education program will consist of eight weekly 20-minute lessons. Each module will be 
entirely self-guided and progressively build upon skills learned in prior lessons. All informational slides will be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_117225]. Brief multiple-choice quizzes and self-
assessments will also be incorporated to assess comprehension of the material. Parents will be encouraged to 
incorporate treatment strategies into their daily routines, interactions, and play activities on a regular basis. The 
planned app format is provided in the following table:

Data Collection: Parent-Child Video Probes.
 At intake, parents will be instructed to submit a 
5
-minute video of a 
parent-child interaction using a child
¶
s preferred toys and activities. Parents are asked to play with their child while 
attempting to elicit as much social engagement and communication as possible.  After completing each online 
PRT lesson, parents will be instructed to submit a 
[ADDRESS_130808] PRT app condition will then watch their own 
video. Parents in the adaptive condition will be asked to watch their own video and score their own PRT fidelity 
using the app
¶
s built in scoring functionality. Specifically, parents will be instructed to pause the video after each 
PRT learning opportunity and tap buttons to indicate the presence or absence of core PRT components (see 
below). This video self-modeling exercise will allow parents to reflect on their own progress and serve as a guide 
to identify areas for future practice. In both conditions, within app upload of each weekly video is required in order 
to unlock access to the next lesson in the online PRT curriculum. 
Data Collection: Standardized Assessments. 
At intake, parents will also complete digital versions of 
standardized survey measures (secondary outcome measures described in the study variable section below) 
through emailed weblinks to testing company secure, encrypted websites. Assessments will be re-administered 2-
3 months after completion of the trial (and 4-5 months from the intake timepoint), allowing families to provide 
additional PRT intervention on an independent basis for 2-3 additional months.
STUDY VARIABLES
Parent Fidelity of Implementation Data (Primary Outcome)
. Video submissions will be independently coded by 
[CONTACT_117227] (FOI) over the course of the program. Each learning opportunity will be scored on a trial by [CONTACT_117228]. Parents must demonstrate each PRT component (described below) in 
80%
 of trials to meet FOI:
Behavioral Coding: Fidelity of Implementation
Child Attention
The parent must have the child

s choice with tasks and activities. However, the parent must always assume 
control should the child engage in dangerous (e.g. self-injury) or inappropriate (e.g. destroying property) activities. 
If child is not showing interest in the current task, parent should attempt to change the activity.
Task Variation
The parent must vary the activities/prompts used across the PRT session probe.

Natural Reinforcement
The parent must provide reinforcement that is directly and logically related to the child verbal request (e.g. the toy 
or activity being requested). Use of non-related reinforcement (stickers, edibles) is inappropriate
 
 
Reinforced Attempts
The parent should reinforce any goal-directed attempt to respond to questions, instructions, or opportunities. 
Although an attempt does not necessarily need to be correct, it has to be reasonable.
Maintenance & Acquisition Tasks
The parent should provide a combination of easy and more challenging task prompts
 
Child Social Communication Behaviors. 
Videos will be coded for the following child social communicative 
behaviors: vocalizations, eye contact, and positive affect. These behaviors were selected due to prior research 
indicating that these social communication skills are particularly important for development and may improve 
following PRT intervention (Bradshaw, Koegel, Koegel, 2017; Koegel, Vernon, Koegel, 2009; Vernon, Koegel, 
Dauterman & Stolen, 2012). Interrater reliability, and kappa estimates will be calculated to ensure consistent 
coding across research assistants.  Video segments in which the child is off-screen/blocked by a parent will be 
eluded from analysis.

Child Vocalizations
 are an indicator of attempts to use verbal communication and are defined as any 
verbal communication attempt that includes both intelligible words and directed word-attempts and 
vocalizations. This variable will be divided into the subcategories of 
prompted vocalizations
 (i.e. responses 
to a parent
¶
s verbal prompt) and 
unprompted vocalizations
 (i.e. spontaneous use of language without 
parent prompts). Undirected, scripted, and self-stimulatory vocalizations will be coded separately.

Child Eye Contact
 [CONTACT_832] a measure of social attention and engagement and is defined as the child looking 
toward the parent
¶
s eyes. 

Child Positive Affect
 is another measure of social attention and engagement within each session and is 
defined as smiling or laughing. It will be coded on a continuous basis
.
Standardized Survey Measures. 
Digital versions of the following survey measures will be used for baseline 
participant characterization purposes in both phases.  In Phase 
2
, these measures will also be administered at a 
6
-month follow-up time-point to obtain preliminary child outcome information.

Parents will complete a digital version of the CDI to obtain information on reported word usage and 
understanding. 
 
Parent App Use Data: 
The amount of time that parents spend using the PRT apps (i.e. engaged in new lessons 
or reviewing old lessons), along with latency between completed lessons will be analyzed as potential predictors of 
outcome. 
 
Parent Perceptions of Acceptability & Effectiveness Data
. Feedback information will be obtained to assess 
parents
¶
satisfaction with the program, confidence in their therapeutic skills, and perceptions of child behavior 
change. parents in both phases will be asked to complete an in-app exit survey.  This survey will consist of both 
quantitative and qualitative elements.  They will first be asked to respond to a variety of statements using a scale 
of 
0
 (Strongly Disagree) to 
5
 (Strongly Agree). Items assessed for in this measure will include statements such as: 
³
Over the course of the program, I have seen my child
¶
s language skills improve,
´
³
Over the course of the program, I have seen my child
¶
s social engagement improve,
´
³
I have a clear understanding of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117221]´
³
I would recommend the course to another family.
´
Parents will also be asked to provide written feedback on their experience of the course and suggestions for 
improvement. This information will help identify potential barriers to program completion and will be used to modify 
the program at the end of both phases: 
1.
In your opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], what were the most positive aspects of the program?
2.
In your opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], what were the most negative aspects of the program?
3.

the weekly lessons? Would you have liked to see more or less of any of these components?
4.
What else could we have added to the lessons to make a concept clearer or easier to understand?
5.
What are your thoughts about the time requirements and pacing for this program? Would you have liked a 
shorter or longer program? Would you have liked more or less detailed lessons?
6.

8.
Do you have any suggestions for improving the video upload or review process?
Data Storage and Reporting: 
Data will be stored on encrypted folders on Box or on REDCap, which is a secure 
research database software program. The proposed trial will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.
  
As part of the 
informed consent process, participants will consent to allow their deidentified data (no videos) to be shared with 
National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). [CONTACT_117244] will hold primary responsibility for publication of the 
results of the study and will work closely with other research team members to ensure timely dissemination of 
findings. 
Will participants be compensated (money, course credit, any other incentive) for their participation?
-Yes

RISKS:
PSYCHOLOGICAL: 
Describe psychological risks (psychological damage, embarrassment, discomfort, forced 
awareness).
Risk:
While the vast majority of children find the motivational 
intervention highly enjoyable, a small percentage of 
participants may be momentarily frustrated when 
encouraged to use language to obtain desired items and 
activities.
Parents may become concerned, distressed, or anxious 
if they do not master the lessons as quickly as they 
anticipated, if their children do not respond to their 
playful intervention bids, and/or if their children do not 
make the progress parents anticipated in language or 
social engagement domains.
Safeguard:
These concerns constitute no more than minimal risk and 
are comparable to everyday experiences by [CONTACT_117229].  The intervention (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117222]) is designed to be socially engaging 
and motivational in nature. It does not require perfect 
language requests in order to reinforce child language with 
desired toys and actvities, tasks are varied frequently to 
ensure that motivation is maintained, and free access to 
activities is initially provided. Parents are encouraged to 
stop the session if the children are having particular 
difficulty on a given day. Participants can withdraw at any 
time without penalty.
For parents, the PRT app lessons will include 
troubleshooting and frequently asked question features 
designed to help parents learn and master missing 
intervention components.   The lessons will also normalize 
the experience of having children be slow to respond or 
make progress and will guide parents to additional 
strategies for further promoting language and other 
developmental gains. Fears of a lack of developmental 
progress would be present in parents even outside the 
context of this research project, while participation actually 
gives them actionable steps to improve their outcomes
PHYSICAL: 
Describe physical risk (injury, exposure to violence, medical equipment).
Risk:
None anticipated
Safeguard:
NA
CONFIDENTIALITY/PRIVACY: 
Describe how privacy will be protected and confidentiality will be maintained (invasion of 
privacy, breach of confidentiality, exposed to criminal or civil liability, loss of job/employability, mandatory reporting to 
outside entities)
Risk:
There is a slight risk of identifiable information being 
exposed. Parent PRT improvement data and feedback 
survey questions pertaining to app usability/suggestions 
for improvement will be shared with Novacoast to further 
revise the app.
Safeguard: Describe how privacy will be protected and 
confidentiality will be maintained. 
The informed consent process serves as the terms and 
conditions document for use of the app, outlining how their 
data can and cannot be used. Parents are informed that 
their de-identified usage data and feedback will be used to 
shared with Novacoast to improve the app. Novacoast is 
not permitted to use the usage data for marketing or other 
research purposes. All participant information/video will be 
encrypted by [CONTACT_117230]. All researchers are HIPAA trained and 
informed of privacy procedures.
DATA STORAGE:

escribe how and where data will be stored. Include the types of devices (e.g., computer, tablet, Cloud 
service storage, etc.) used to store the information and if the devices are encrypted and/or password protected.
Risk:
All participant information/video will be encrypted by [CONTACT_117231]. 
Participant videos will be stored indefinitely. 
However, participants may request that these videos be 
deleted at any time. Identifiable information (e.g. contact 
[CONTACT_3031]) will be stored separately from research 
data. A code will be assigned to link the data back to the 
subjects. 
Safeguard: 
If identifiable data (i.e., information and/or 
biospecimens) will be collected, include the disposition (for 
example, if identifiers might be removed or retained, how 
the data will shared, stored, archived, etc.) NOTE: Consent 
form(s) must include the storage and disposition of the 
data.

CONSENT PROCESS: 
Describe procedures for obtaining informed consent. Include who will be responsible for seeking 
consent, how, when, and where consent will be obtained. 
If research will involve a non-native speaking population or an 
international component, describe the investigator(s) linguistic proficiency and/or how the consent documents will be 
translated in the subject
¶
s native language. Describe the measures taken to ensure subjects are informed about the 
research and how the appropriateness of the consent process will adhere to cultural standards.
Select which of the following criteria applies to your project:
No-The principal risks are those associated with a breach of confidentiality concerning the subject's participation in 
the research AND the consent document is the only record linking the subject with the research.
Yes-The research presents no more than minimal risk and involves procedures that do not require written consent 
when they are performed outside of a research setting.
Select the consent process that you propose to use in this study as an alternative to written informed consent:
No-Oral Consent
Yes-Information Sheet
No-Other
No-The subjects are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm.
-Yes
Are you requesting a waiver of written documentation? Consent forms must be signed unless a waiver of written 
documentation (i.e. physical signing of the consent form) is requested, justified and approved.
Waiver of Written Documentation
When families respond to recruitment advertisements expressing interest in participation, they will be scheduled for 
a consent video conference or phone session with a member of the UCSB research team. Prior to or during this 
meeting, they will be asked to download the smartphone app and follow along with the in-app written consent 
information. This information will also be emailed to them. Potential participants will first be presented with a brief 
summary of the project and a timeline.  Participants then have the option to continue to a hear more detailed 
informed consent information or decline participation.  After hearing about the project from a member of the UCSB 
research team and reading through the informed consent information, participants have the option to digitally sign 
the consent form, read through frequently asked questions, and ask the research team questions, or have additional 
time to think about it.
receiving data access.  Staff access to the server is 
restricted based on project roles and access privileges are 
reviewed quarterly.
AUTONOMY: 
Describe the risk to autonomy (incentives coercion, economic, use of own students/staff/friends):
Risk:
Financial incentives may coerce participants to enroll. 
Participants may fear their app usage data is being used 
by [CONTACT_117232]-research purposes (marketing)
Safeguard:
Incentives are reasonable based on time involved ($25 for 
intake questionnaires and $[ADDRESS_130810].
OTHER: 
Describe any risks not listed above.

Child Assent and Parental Permission
Will you be requesting a waiver of assent for children aged 17 or younger?
-No
Will you be requesting a waiver of written parental or guardian permission?
-Yes
Which type of waiver applies to your project?
I am obtaining parental or guardian permission, but not 
collecting signed consent forms
Provide a substantive rationale for this request to waive written parental permission:
The study will be conducted completely online and participants will not meet in person with the research team; 
therefore, an electronic consent form with digital signature [INVESTIGATOR_92112].
Select which of the following criteria applies to your project:
Yes-The research presents no more than minimal risk; it is not practicable to conduct the research without the 
waiver or alteration; waiving or altering the permission will not adversely affect the subjects
¶
rights and welfare; 
and pertinent information will be provided to the subjects later if appropriate
No-The research will be conducted by [CONTACT_117233]; the 
project is designed to examine (i) public benefit of service programs, ii) procedures for obtaining benefits or 
services under those programs; iii) possible changes in or alternatives to those programs or procedures; or iv) 
possible changes in methods or levels of payment for benefits or services under those programs AND it is not 
practicable to conduct the research without the waiver or alteration.
No-Written parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the subjects (e.g. 
neglected or abused children) AND there are appropriate mechanisms for protecting the children who will 
participate as subjects in the research are substituted AND the waiver is not inconsistent with federal, state, or 
local law.
Waiver of Consent:
-No
Are you requesting an alteration or a full waiver of informed consent? If the consent process omits or alters one or more 
of the required elements (see 1-10 below) of informed consent, then a waiver of consent must be requested, justified and 
approved. 
-No

CONSENT FORMS:
Form Name
[CONTACT_117242]/BENEFIT ANALYSIS:
 Activities involving human subjects can only be approved if the expected benefits outweigh 
the risks and activities do not pose any unnecessary risks to subjects.
BENEFITS: 
Describe benefits, if any, to the subjects, to the class of subjects, to society, and to advancement of 
knowledge. If there are no direct benefits anticipated for the subjects, please state as such. 
Do not include 
compensation as a benefit.
It is anticipated, though not guaranteed, that the participant children with ASD will exhibit increases in their use of 
appropriate social-communication skills. It is also anticipated that participant parents will acquire effective intervention 
skills. Disparities in access to services for children with ASD are an area of increasing concern for the field of autism 
research, and this study will examine whether an smartphone app-based intervention model can help to provide 
quality services to those who might not otherwise receive them. 
RISK-BENEFIT ANALYSIS: 
Explain why any risks to the study are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits to 
subjects and/or society.
There are minimal risks associated with participation in this study. The potential to improve treatment access and 
outcomes for many children with ASD represent substantial benefits.

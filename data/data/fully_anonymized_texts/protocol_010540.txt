ABSTRACT 
EURAMOS 1 is a joint protocol of four of the world‟s leading multi-institutional osteosarcoma groups 
(COG, COSS, EORTC/MRC, SSG). The collaboration‟s main aim is to optimize the treatment of patients 
suffering from osteosarcoma. The EURAMOS [ADDRESS_457570] three-drug induction regimen consisting of 2 cycles of cisplatin and 
doxorubicin along with four cycles of methotrexate ( MAP ). After recovery from chemotherapy, patients 
then proceed to surgical resection. Post-operative therapy is determined by [CONTACT_366015]. Good responders (< 10% viable tumor) will be randomized to continue with MAP , or receive 
pegylated interferon alfa-2b as maintenance therapy after MAP ( MAPi[INVESTIGATOR_365940]).  Poor responders (
  10% viable 
t
umor) will be randomized to continue with MAP  or to receive the same regimen with the addition of 
ifosfamide and etoposide ( MAPIE ). Event-free survival is the primary endpoint.

1.0 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS) 
 
Primary: 
 
1.1 
In a randomized setting, to examine whether the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) to post-
operative chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate improves the event-free survival for 
patients with resectable osteosarcoma and a poor histological response to [ADDRESS_457571]-operative chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin and methotrexate improves the 
event-free survival for patients with resectable osteosarcoma and a good histological response to 10 
weeks of pre-operative chemotherapy. 
 
Secondary: 
 
1.[ADDRESS_457572]-operative therapy for poor responders, and the addition of 
Peg-Intron as maintenance therapy for good responders, leads to an improvement in the following outcomes: 
a. Overall survival 
b. Short-term toxicity 
c. Long-term toxicity 
d. Quality of life

In order for an institution to maintain COG membership requirements, every new ly diagnosed patient needs 
to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the Enrollment on the Official COG Registry, The 
Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) . 
 
A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration process. Each patient will 
be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID. For additional information about the labeling of 
specimens please refer to the Pathology and/or Biology Guidelines in this protocol.  
 
3.1.2 IRB Approval  
Local IRB/REB approval of this study must be obtained by a site prior to enrolling patients. Sites must 
submit IRB/REB approvals to the NCI‟s Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) Regulatory Office and allow 
[ADDRESS_457575] include a fax coversheet (or optional CTSU IRB 
Transmittal Sheet) and the IRB approval document(s). The CTSU IRB Certification Form may be 
submitted in lieu of the signed IRB approval letter. All CTSU forms can be located on the CTSU web 
page ( https://www.ctsu.org ). Any other regulatory documents needed for access to the study enrollment 
screens will be listed for the study on the CTSU Member‟s Website under the RSS Tab.  
 
IRB/REB approval documents may be faxed ([PHONE_3769]), 
Emailed ( [EMAIL_537] ) or mailed to the CTSU Regulatory office.  
 
When a site has a pending patient enrollment within the next 24 hours, this is considered a “Time of 
Need” registration.  For Time of Need registrations, in addition to marking your submissions as 
„UR
GENT‟ and faxing the regulatory documents, call the CTSU Regulatory Helpdesk at: 1-866-651-

  Page 16 4.1 General Treatment Information  
 
4.1.1 Induction – MAP Therapy- All Patients  
Induction therapy lasts 10 weeks and consists of two cycles of MAP (doxorubicin-cisplatin and high dose 
methotrexate therapy). If administrative issues preclude surgical resection at Week 10, patients may 
receive up to two additional cycles of high dose methotrexate (maximum of 6 cycles of methotrexate) 
before surgical resection/amputation. In addition, if a patient develops mucositis or transaminase 
elevations precluding administration of back- to-back methotrexate cycles, the patient may receive only 2 
cycles of high dose methotrexate (instead of four) before the surgical procedure. 
 
Drug administration instructions should be followed except  when they vary from institutional 
chemotherapy standards developed for purposes of promoting medication safety, and approved by 
[CONTACT_366016]. 
 
4.1.2 Local Control  
At Week 11 surgery will be done (see Section 14.0 for complete surgical directions).  An evaluation of 
histologic response is essential (see Section 15.0 for information about this evaluation). 
 
Please note: All chemotherapy doses should be calculated using pre-surgery body surface area with 
no adjustment for limb loss. 
 
Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients on this study. However, if treating physicians must use 
radiation therapy for compelling clinical reasons, COG radiation therapy guidelines have been provided in 
Section 18. 
 
At randomization, the institutional assessment of histologic response will be used in determining 
whether the criteria for randomization have been met. Institutions are also required to submit the 
surgical specimen for central review. See Section 15.[ADDRESS_457581] fulfill the following criteria for randomization after surgery: 
 Local institutional assessment of histological response in primary tumor following definitive 
surgery  
 Exactly  two courses of cisplatin and doxorubicin must have been administered before surgery 
 At least two courses and no more than six courses of methotrexate must have been administered 
before surgery 
 No severe toxicity precluding post-operative treatment 
 No progression of metastatic disease or new metastatic disease 
 No progression of localized tumor (see Section 9.1) 
 Macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_365944], complete removal of all metastases or complete removal 
planned and deemed feasible 
 Essential data for eligibility, chemotherapy, surgery, and pathology provided to SDC 
 Written consent to undergo randomization obtained 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  
Patients with good histologic response after induction therapy will be randomized to receive either 
therapy with MAP (29 total weeks of therapy) or with MAP plus pegylated interferon alfa-2b (104 total 
weeks of therapy). Week 12 and Week 15 MAP therapy may be started before randomization assignment

Patients with poor histologic response after induction therapy will be randomized to receive either therapy 
with MAP (29 total weeks of therapy) or with MAP plus ifosfamide and etoposide (40 total weeks of 
therapy). Week 12 and Week 15 MAP therapy may be started before randomization assignment is made, 
if the patient meets criteria to begin treatment but the pathology on the definitive surgical specimen has 
not yet been obtained.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Patients who did not receive sufficient chemotherapy to allow randomization are recommended to receive 
post-operative chemotherapy with MAP.  Patients who experience tumor progression during pre-operative 
treatment are recommended to receive post-operative treatment with MAPIE.  Patients who are not 
eligible for randomization because macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_365945]/or other experimental treatments as determined at the treating institution.    
 
All patients enrolled on AOST0331 will remain on-study for follow-up information until the conditions in 
Section 9.2 are met.

ANC must be ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL to start a cycle of therapy.  
 
DOXOrubicin : IV over 48 hours 
Days: 1-2 of Weeks 1 and 6.  
Dose: 37.5 mg/m²/Daily dose (Total dose is 75 mg/m²/48 hour infusion ). 
Avoid extravasation. 
Hydration : 3000 mL/m2/day. 
Cardioprotection : Dexrazoxane may be used if a 10% fall in LVEF or similar fall within the normal range 
of SF occurs. If cardioprotection is used, 37.5 mg/m2 of doxorubicin will be given as a 15 minute infusion 
on days 1and 2 of Weeks 1 and 6, immediately following dexrazoxane (Start DOXOrubi cin infusion after 
completion of dexrazoxane infusion but within 30 minutes of beginning of the dexrazoxane infusion ). 
 
CISplatin : IV over 4 hours 
Days: 1 and 2 of Weeks 1 and 6. 
Dose: 60 mg/ m²/dose  
 
Methotrexate : IV over 4 hours 
Days: 1 of Weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. 
Dose: 12 g/m²/dose (Maximum dose 20 g). 
 
Hydration : Adequate fluid with electrolytes and bicarbonate must be given to maintain a urine 
output > 80 % of the fluid intake, measured every four hours and alkalinization. This should be 
maintained until serum methotrexate level is < 0.1 µmol/L (1x10-7 M). 
Urine pH :  A urinary pH > [ADDRESS_457582] be achieved before starting methotrexate infusion and maintained until 
serum methotrexate level is < 0.1 µmol/L (1x10-7 M). 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_457583] begin 24 hours after start of methotrexate infusion and be continued until serum 
methotrexate level is < 0.1 µmol/L (1x10-7 M) or delayed excretion criteria is reached. See Section 19.3 
for details. 
 
Growth factor :  
Myeloid growth factor support is recommended when a previous doxorubicin/cisplatin cycle has been 
complicated by [CONTACT_366017]-catheter related sepsis or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (> 7 
days). Begin myeloid growth factor support at least 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy. If given 
daily then continue until WBC ≥ 5000/µL after nadir and discontinue at least 2 days prior to next cycle of 
chemotherapy.  
 
If administrative issues preclude surgical resection at Week 11, patients may receive up to two additional 
cycles of high dose methotrexate (maximum of 6 cycles of methotrexate) before surgical 
resection/amputation. When additional cycles of high dose methotrexate are planned, give one week off 
after the last scheduled methotrexate and then give one or two extra doses weekly depending on when 
resection can be scheduled. In addition, if a patient develops mucositis or transaminase elevations 
precluding administration of back- to-back methotrexate cycles, the patient may receive only 2 cycles of 
high dose methotrexate (instead of four) before the surgical procedure.

Methotrexate will develop hypertransaminasemia and 
occasionally hyperbilirubinemia. These elevations can last 
up to two weeks following the methotrexat e infusion and 
will not be considered toxicity requiring discontinuation of 
the drug.  
 
Persistent hyperbilirubinemia for longer than three weeks  
will result in discontinuation of MTX  
 
 
An attempt to give any omitted MTX doses should be made after the end of scheduled protocol

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
 
6.1 DOXORUBICIN  (Adriamycin®) NSC #123127     (03/25/08) 
 
Source and Pharmacology : An anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius . 
The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought 
to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin. 
Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of 
doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA-cleavable complexes appears to be an important 
mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity. Doxorubicin cellular membrane binding may affect a 
variety of cellular functions. Enzymatic electron reduction of doxorubicin by a variety of oxidases, 
reductases and dehydrogenases generate highly reactive species including the hydroxyl free radical 
(OH•). Free radical formation has been implicated in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by [CONTACT_56930] (II) and 
Fe (III) reduction at the cellular level. Cells treated with doxorubicin have been shown to manifest the 
characteristic morphologic changes associated with apoptosis or programmed cell death. Doxorubicin-
induced apoptosis may be an integral component of the cellular mechanism of action relating to 
therapeutic effects, toxicities, or both. 
 
Doxorubicin serum decay pattern is multiphasic. The initial distributive t ½ is approximately 5 minutes 
suggesting rapid tissue uptake of doxorubicin. The terminal t ½ of 20 to 48 hours reflects a slow 
elimination from tissues. Steady-state distribution volumes exceed 20 to 30 L/kg and are indicative of 
extensive drug uptake into tissues. Plasma clearance is in the range of 8 to 20 mL/min/kg and is 
predominately by [CONTACT_366024].  The P450 cytochromes which appear to be involved 
with doxorubicin metabolism are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the 
bile in 5 days, while only 5 to 12% of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same 
time period. Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite, doxorubicinol, to plasma proteins is about 
74 to 76% and is independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin.

6.2 CISPLATIN (Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II, CDDP, cis-DDP, Platinol-AQ) NSC #119875  
(04/1 2/10) 
 
Sou
rce and Pharmacology: 
Cisplatin is an inorganic, water-soluble complex containing a central platinum atom, [ADDRESS_457625] with nucleophilic 
sites on DNA, RNA, or protein resulting in the formation of bi-functional covalent links, very similar to 
alkylating reactions. The intra-strand cross-links, in particular with guanine and cytosine, change DNA 
conformation and inhibit DNA synthesis leading to the cytotoxic and anti-tumor effects of cisplatin. 
Cisplatin has synergistic cytotoxicity with radiation and other chemotherapeutic agents.  Cisplatin has a 
rapid distribution phase of 25-80 minutes with a slower secondary elimination half-life of 60-70 hours. The 
platinum from cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins including 
albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two hours after the end 
of a three hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. The complexes between albumin 
and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a 
minimum half-life of five days or more.  Platinum is present in tissues for as long as [ADDRESS_457626] 
administration. Both cisplatin and platinum are excreted through the kidneys ranging from 10-50%. Fecal 
elimination is minimal. Cisplatin‟s penetration into the CNS is poor.

 (L) Toxicity may also occur later. 
 
Formulation and Stability:  Available as an aqueous solution containing 1mg/ml of cisplatin and 9mg 
(1.54mEq)/ml of sodium chloride in 50ml, 100ml and 200 ml multi-dose non-preserved vials. Store at  
15°- 25°C (68º-77ºF). Do not refrigerate . Protect unopened container from light. The cisplatin remaining 
in the amber vial following initial entry is stable for 28 days protected from light or for 7 days under 
fluorescent room light. Cisplatin removed from its amber container should be protected from light if not 
used within 6 hours. 
 
Guidelines for Administration : See the Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of this protocol.

6.3 METHOTREXATE (MTX, amethopterin, Trexall®) NSC #000740  (10/15/08) 
 
Source and Pharmacology: 
A folate analogue which reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that reduces folic acid to 
tetrahydrofolic acid. Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate formation limits the availability of one carbon fragments 
necessary for the synthesis of purines and the conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the synthesis 
of DNA and cell reproduction. The polyglutamated metabolites of MTX also contribute to the cytotoxic 
effect of MTX on DNA repair and/or strand breaks. MTX cytotoxicity is highly dependent on the absolute 
drug concentration and the duration of drug exposure. MTX is actively transported across cell membranes. 
At serum methotrexate concentrations exceeding 0.1µmol/mL, passive diffusion becomes a major means of 
intracellular transport of MTX. The drug is widely distributed throughout the body with the highest 
concentration in the kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder and skin. Plasma concentrations following high dose 
IV MTX decline in a biphasic manner with an initial half-life of 1.5-3.5 hours, and a terminal half life of 8-
15 hours. About 50% is bound to protein. MTX is excreted primarily by [CONTACT_366025]. Renal clearance usually equals or exceeds creatinine 
clearance. Small amounts are excreted in the feces. There is significant entero-hepatic circulation of MTX.  
The distribution of MTX into third-space fluid collections, such as pleural effusions and ascitic fluid, can 
substantially alter MTX pharmacokinetics. The slow release of accumulated MTX from these third spaces 
over time prolongs the terminal half-life of the drug, leading to potentially increased clinical toxicity.

6.4 IFOSFAMIDE  
(Isophosphamide, Iphosphamide, Z4942, Ifex®) NSC #109724 (03/30/09) 
 
Source and Pharmacology: 
Ifosfamide is a structural analogue of cyclophosphamide.  Ifosfamide requires hepatic microsomal activation 
(P450 3A isoenzymes) for the production of the reactive 4-hydroxyoxazaphorine intermediate which serves 
as a carrier molecule for the ultimate intracellular liberation of acrolein and phosphoramide mustard which 
is an active bifunctional alkylating species.  Acrolein is thought to be the cause of the hemorrhagic cystitis 
as seen with cyclophosphamide.  Ifosfamide demonstrates dose-dependent pharmacokinetics whereby [CONTACT_366027]-life ranges from 7 to 16 hours at doses of 1.6- 2.4 g/m² to 3.8-5 g/m², respectively. At 1.6 -
 2.4
 g/m²/d, 12 to 18% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug in the urine, whereas at a 5 g/m² single-
dose, 61% was excreted in the urine as the parent drug.  Evidence also exists to suggest that ifosfamide 
metabolism is inducible, with more rapid clearance occurring in the second and later doses when a course of 
therapy is given as fractionated doses over 3 to 5 days.  There is more chloroethyl side chain oxidation of 
ifosfamide (up to 50%) than of cyclophosphamide (< 10%), and the degree of such metabolism is more 
variable than with cyclophosphamide. Oxidation of the chloroethyl groups produces chloroacetaldehyde, 
which is thought to be responsible for the neurotoxicity and renal toxicity that have been seen with 
ifosfamide therapy.

6.5 ETOPOSIDE  
(VePesid®, Etopophos®,VP-16)  NSC #141540    (03/30/09) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that forms a complex with 
topoisomerase II and DNA which results in single and double strand DNA breaks. Its main effect appears 
to be in the S and G 2 phase of the cell cycle. The initial t½ is 1.5 hours and the mean terminal half-life is 4 
t
o 11 hours. It is primarily excreted in the urine. In children, approximately 55% of the dose is excreted in 
the urine as etoposide in 24 hours. The mean renal clearance of etoposide is 7 to 10 mL/min/m² or about 
35% of the total body clearance over a dose range of 80 to 600 mg/m². Etoposide, therefore, is cleared by 
[CONTACT_366028], i.e., metabolism and biliary excretion. The effect of renal disease on 
plasma etoposide clearance is not known. Biliary excretion appears to be a minor route of etoposide 
elimination. Only 6% or less of an intravenous dose is recovered in the bile as etoposide. Metabolism 
accounts for most of the non renal clearance of etoposide. 
 
The maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration time curve (AUC) exhibit a high 
degree of patient variability. Etoposide is highly bound to plasma proteins (~94%), primarily serum 
albumin. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that etoposide systemic exposure is related to toxicity. 
Preliminary data suggests that systemic exposure for unbound etoposide correlates better than total 
(bound and unbound) etoposide. There is poor diffusion into the CSF < 5%. 
 
Etoposide phosphate is a water soluble ester of etoposide which is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_365968]. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data indicate that etoposide phosphate is 
bioequivalent to etoposide when it is administered in molar equivalent doses.

6.7 MESNA    (
sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate,UCB 3983, Mesnex
 ) NSC #113891      
(03/30/09) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   Mesna was developed as a prophylactic agent to reduce the risk of 
hem
orrhagic cystitis induced by [CONTACT_327787]. Mesna is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_365975], mesna 
disulfide (dimesna). Mesna disulfide remains in the intravascular compartment and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_365976]. In the kidney, the mesna disulfide is reduced to the free thiol compound, mesna, which 
reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites (acrolein and 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide) resulting 
in their detoxification. The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4-hydroxy-
ifosfamide forming a nonurotoxic 4-sulfoethylthioifosfamide. Mesna also binds to the double bonds of 
acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites. In multiple human xenograft or rodent tumor model studies, 
mesna in combination with ifosfamide (at dose ratios of up to 20-fold as single or multiple courses) failed 
to demonstrate interference with antitumor efficacy. 
 
After an 800 mg dose the half lives for mesna and diMesna are 0.36 hours and 1.17 hours, respectively. 
Approximately 32% and 33% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in [ADDRESS_457632] an oral bioavailability of 45-79% and a urinary bioavailability which ranged from 45-79% of 
intravenously administered mesna.  The oral bioavailability is unaffected by [CONTACT_8208]. When compared to 
intravenously administered mesna, the intravenous plus oral dosing regimen increases systemic exposures 
(150%) and provides more sustained excretion of mesna in the urine over a 24-hour period.

Unknown Frequency and 
Timing:  Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of mesna have no t been noted in animals fed 10 times 
the recommended human doses. There are , however , no adequate and well -controlled studies in 
pregnant women. It is not known if mesna or dimesna is excreted into human milk  
1All currently available products in the U.S. are preserved with benzyl alcohol. Benzyl Alcohol has been associated 
with death in pre-term infants weighing less than 2500 g and receiving 99- 405 mg/kg/day. Benzyl alcohol is 
normally oxidized rapi[INVESTIGATOR_365977], conjugated with glycine in the liver, and excreted as hippuric acid. In 
pre-term infants, however, this metabolic pathway may not be well developed. Onset of toxic illness in these infants 
occurred between several days and a few weeks of age with a characteristic clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_365978]. Many infants also had central-nervous-system 
dysfunction, including convulsions and intracranial hemorrhage; hypotension leading to cardiovascular collapse 
was a late finding usually preceding death. [For comparison in the ICE regimen of 3000 mg/m²/day of ifosfamide 
and a daily mesna dose of 60% of the ifosfamide dose = to 1800 mg/m²/day; a child would be expected to receive

6.8 LEUCOVORIN CALCIUM  (LCV, Wellcovorin®, citrovorum factor, folinic acid)  
NSC #003590         (03/25/09)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Leucovorin is a mixture of the diastereoisomers of the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). 
The biologically active compound of the mixture is the (-)- l-isomer, known as Citrovorum factor or (-)-
folinic acid. Leucovorin does not require reduction by [CONTACT_366030] a source of “one-carbon” moieties. Administration of 
leucovorin can counteract the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, 
which act by [CONTACT_366031]. In contrast, leucovorin can enhance the therapeutic and 
toxic effects of fluoropyrimidines used in cancer therapy, such as 5-fluorouracil. Leucovorin is readily 
converted to another reduced folate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of 
fluorodeoxyuridylic acid  (an active metabolite of 5-FU) to thymidylate synthase and thereby [CONTACT_366032]. Peak serum levels of 5-methyl THF (an active metabolite) were reached at 
approximately 1.3-1.5 hours (IV/IM) and 2.[ADDRESS_457633] 100% of the l-isomer (the 
biologically active form) but only 20% of the d-isomer is absorbed. Oral absorption of leucovorin is 
sa
turable at doses above 25 mg. The apparent bioavailability of leucovorin was 97% for 25 mg, 75% for 
50 mg, and 37% for 100 mg doses. Both oral and parenteral leucovorin raise the CSF folate levels. 
 
Toxicity: 
 Common  
Happens to 21 -100 children 
out of every 100  Occasional  
Happens to 5 -20 children out of 
every 100  Rare  
Happens to <5 children out of every 
100 
Immediate:  
Within 1 -2 days of 
receiving drug    Anaphylaxis, urticaria, seizure  
Unknown Frequenc y and timing:  Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of leucovorin in humans are unknown.  It is unknown 
whether the drug is excreted in breast milk.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST0331  
  Page 59 Formulation and Stability:   Leucovorin calcium for injection is supplied as a sterile ready to use liquid 
and a sterile powder for injection. The 10 mg/mL preservative free liquid is available in 50 mL vials 
containing sodium chloride 400 mg/vial. Store preservative free liquid in the refrigerator at 2°-8°C (36°-
46°F) protected from light. The powder for injection is available in 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 350 mg and 
500 mg vials. Store at room temperature 15°-25°C (59°-77°F) protected from light. Reconstitute the sterile 
powder with sterile water for injection or bacteriostatic water for injection to a concentration of 10mg/mL 
leucovorin calcium. Do not use diluents containing benzyl alcohol for doses >10 mg/m² or in infants 
< 2 years of age or patients with allergy to benzyl alcohol . When Bacteriostatic Water is used, the 
reconstituted solution is good for 7 days.  If reconstituted with sterile water, use solution immediately as it 
contains no preservative. One milligram of leucovorin calcium contains 0.004 mEq of leucovorin and 
0.004 mEq of calcium. 
 
The oral form of leucovorin is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 25 mg tablets. Inactive ingredients 
vary depending on manufacturer but tablet formulations may include: corn starch, dibasic calcium 
phosphate, magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium 
s
tarch glycolate. 
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol.  
 
 Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, no more than 160 mg of leucovorin should be 
injected intravenously per minute (16 mL of a 10 mg/mL solution per minute). IV leucovorin and sodium 
bicarbonate are incompatible. 
 
Oral leucovorin should be spaced evenly (e.g.: every six hours) throughout the day and may be taken 
without regard to meals. Doses > 25 mg should be given IV due to the saturation of absorption. 
 
Leucovorin should not be administered < 24 hours after intrathecal injections which contain methotrexate 
unless there are special circumstances.

6.9 DEXRAZOXANE (ICRF-187, ADR-529, ZINECARD
 ) NSC #169780  (03/25/09) 
Source and Pharmacology :  Dexrazoxane is a synthetic chemical, a cyclic derivative of EDTA that 
readily penetrates cell membranes. Results of laboratory studies suggest that dexrazoxane is converted 
intracellularly to a ring opened chelating agent that interferes with iron mediated free radical generation 
thought to be responsible, in part, for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. The disposition kinetics of 
dexrazoxane are dose-dependent with administered doses from 60 to 900 mg/m2. The plasma half-life is [ADDRESS_457634], and two monoacid-monoamide ring products in the urine of animals and man. 
Metabolite levels were not measured in the pharmacokinetics studies. Urinary excretion plays an 
important role in the elimination of dexrazoxane: 42% of the drug (500 mg/m2) was excreted in the urine. 
In vitro studies have shown that dexrazoxane is not bound to plasma proteins. The pharmacokinetics of 
dexrazoxane have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. There was no 
significant effect of dexrazoxane on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) or its predominant 
metabolite, doxorubicinol in a crossover study in cancer patients.

Frequency and 
Timing:   Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects have been noted in animals. Dexrazoxane was maternotoxic, 
embryotoxic and te ratogenic when given to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis. It 
is not known whether dexrazoxane  is excreted in human milk.  
 
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Dexrazoxane for Injection is available as a sterile, pyrogen-free lyophilized powder in the following 
strengths: 250 mg single dose vial packaged with a 25 mL vial of 0.167 Molar (M/6) Sodium Lactate 
Injection, USP and 500 mg single dose vial  packaged with a 50 mL vial of 0.167 Molar (M/6) Sodium 
Lactate Injection, USP. Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). 
 
Dexrazoxane must be reconstituted with 0.167 Molar (M/6) Sodium Lactate Injection, USP, to give a 
concentration of 10 mg dexrazoxane for each mL of sodium lactate. Reconstituted dexrazoxane, when 
transferred to an empty infusion bag, is stable for 6 hours from the time of reconstitution when stored at 
controlled room  temperature, 15°-30°C (59°-86°F) or under refrigeration, 2°-8°C (36°-46°F).  
 
The reconstituted dexrazoxane solution may be further diluted with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP or 5.0% Dextrose Injection, USP to a concentration range of 1.3 to 5.0 mg/mL in 
intravenous infusion bags. The resultant solutions are stable for 6 hours when stored at controlled room 
temperature, 15°-30°C (59°-86°F) or under refrigeration, 2°-8°C (36°-46°F).  
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol. 
 
For the prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, administer IV push immediately prior t o 
anthracycline dose. Administer the anthracycline after completing the infusion of dexrazoxane but within 
30 minutes of beginning of the dexrazoxane infusion.

7. 2.1. Schedule  
Participating institutions will follow all patients for 10 years after the patient is enrolled on the study, for 
relapse and survival, regardless of protocol violation. The date of relapse will be defined as the date on 
which evidence of relapse is confirmed, whether radiologically or clinically. If relapse is detected at any 
site, a complete diagnostic investigation (chest CT scan, bone scan, imaging of primary tumor site) is 
suggested. Refer to Section 17.0 for an overview of suggested imaging studies during follow-up.  
 
7. 2.2. Clinic visits after end of chemotherapy  
The following are minimum guidelines for timing of follow-up visits to ensure consistency in the 
detection of relapse or progression. 
            Years 1-2 every 6 weeks-3 months 
Years 3-4 every 2-4 months 
Years 5-10 every 6 months 
Thereafter every 6-12 months according to local practice 
 
7. 2.3 Toxicity/Late – Effects Related Follow- Up 
Multimodal therapy of osteosarcoma may be associated with permanent alterations of cardiac, renal, 
auditory, and reproductive function, orthopedic problems and other late effects including secondary 
malignancies. Appropriate additional investigations are suggested in order to ensure optimal patient care. 
Cardiac toxicity, renal toxicity  and ototoxicity  are of particular interest in this stud y. Refer to the COG 
form packet for follow-up requirements. . 
 
 
8.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES 
 
8.1 Venous Access  
The presence of a double lumen central venous access device (VAD) is recommended but not required. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_457640] spectrum antibiotics should be chosen in 
consideration of local microbials. Since nephrotoxic agents are used in this therapy, aminoglycosides 
should be used with caution. 
 
8.3.2 
Growth factor support: Since treatment intensity is important, myeloid growth factor support is preferable 
to dose reduction and should begin at least 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy. If given daily then 
continue until WBC ≥ 5000/µL after nadir. The recommended dose indicated in the package insert should 
be used. Chemotherapy should not be given until a patient has been off myeloid growth factor support for 
[ADDRESS_457641] therapy but may be used at the discretion of the investigator e.g. for patients 
who refuse transfusion on religious grounds.  
 
8.4.2 
Suggested platelet transfusions for bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia. Give platelet transfusions 
prophylactically when counts drop below 10,000/
 l. Some institutions may use higher thresholds for 
platelet transfusion, e.g. 20,000/
 L. Higher thresholds should also be used during septic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
 
8.4.3 
Appropriate national and institutional guidelines should be followed regarding filtering and irradiation of 
blood products.  
 
8.5 Pneumocystis carinii  
Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis is recommended even though the risk of pneumocystis infection in this 
population is relatively low.  
Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) should not be administered with or close to the 
administration of high dose methotrexate . Sulfonamides can displace methotrexate from plasma 
binding sites and increase free methotrexate. Trimethoprim can interfere with the microbiological DHFR 
assay for methotrexate; no interference occurs with the RIA. In addition, both agents have similar 
toxicities, and the administration of TMP/SMX increases the risk of high dose methotrexate toxicity.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_457642] cisplatin-containing course and up to 
approximately three months after completion of chemotherapy.  Intravenous magnesium supplementation 
in the hydration fluids should be considered during administration of cisplatin or ifosfamide. This would 
involve: 
 
Post-cisplatin - hydration with D5W ½ NS + 10 mEq KCl/L + 20mEq MgSO 4/L at  125 mL/m2/hr 
 
After therapy - supplement Mg with preparations such as:  
Magnesium oxide (2 caps/m2 - 7 mEq /140 mg capsule) or  
Magnesium gluconate (6 tablets/m2 - 2.2 mEq/500mg tab) or 
Maalox #1 (2 tabs/m2 - 7 mEq/tab) 
 
8.7 Neurotoxicity associated with ifosfamide  
Gui
dance for dose adjustment is found in section 5.3 & 5.4. If Grade 4 neurotoxicity occurs during 
ifosfamide administration, investigators may consider administration of methylene blue at 2 mg/kg 
(maximum dose 50 mg) on the day this occurs.  The dose may be repeated at 4 hours and 8 hours after, 
following which ifosfamide should be discontinued and no further ifosfamide will be administered.  
Investigators should consider substituting cyclophosphamide and mesna, both 500 mg/m² x [ADDRESS_457643] as yet not 
been prospectively evaluated in this group of patients.  Administration of bisphosphonates should be 
recorded on Form (end of treatment) 
 
 
9.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY AND OFF STUDY 
CRITERIA  
 
9.1 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy 
The duration of the MAP regimen is 29 weeks and the duration of the MAPIE regimen is 40 weeks.  In 
the MAPi[INVESTIGATOR_365979], duration of therapy will be two years in total.  Surgery is intended to be performed at 
Week 11 in all arms. 
 
Patients may be withdrawn from protocol treatment for the reasons listed below. 
 
 Relapse, or tumor progression 
 Serious adverse events (including second malignancies) or other major toxicity 
prohibiting continuation of protocol therapy 
 Pregnancy 
 Personal wish of the patient 
 Any other situation where continued protocol treatment may not be in the best interest 
of the patient 
 
The reason for terminating treatment should be recorded on the appropriate data entry screen along with 
all other post-treatment investigations (see Section 7.1). 
 
Patients who do not meet the criteria for randomization are off protocol therapy, however, these patients 
will be followed up for [ADDRESS_457644] patient starts the study, for the purpose of follow-up. 
Treatment recommendations for patients who are not randomized are: 
 
 If the required amount of pre-operative chemotherapy to qualify a patient for randomization has 
not been given, then give post-operative chemotherapy according to the MAP schedule.  
 
 If patients experience tumor progression during pre-operative treatment, give post-operative 
chemotherapy according to the MAPIE schedule. 
 
 If the surgery is not macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_365980], the patient should receive radiotherapy and/or 
other experimental treatment as appropriate. 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_457645] to follow- up. 
 Patient enrollment onto another COG study with tumor therapeutic intent (e.g., at recurrence). 
 Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
10.1 Endpoints  
The primary endpoint for EURAMOS-1 is event-free survival (EFS), secondary endpoints are overall 
survival (OS), toxicity and quality of life.  For the statistical comparison of the randomized arms, EFS 
and OS will be measured from date of randomization to date of the event or death as appropriate; 
surviving patients will be censored at the date last known to be alive.  For reporting EFS and OS 
estimates at specific timepoints, these measures will be calculated from date of diagnostic biopsy.  
Treatment comparisons of EFS and OS will also be conducted in the subgroup of localized patients.  Trial 
conclusions will be based on all endpoints.  Events are defined as death, detection of local recurrence or 
metastasis, progression of metastatic disease, or detection of a secondary malignancy. Toxicity will be 
assessed using the CTCAE v3.0. Good histological response is defined as < 10% viable tumor. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_457646] been calculated using the method of George and Desu (George 
and Desu, 1974).  The good histological response rate for the MAP induction regimen, estimated from 
INT 0133, is 45%. Analysis of EFS is planned to take place around two years after the closure to 
recruitment to the trial, analysis of OS is planned for around four years after closure. 
 
Based on the previous experience of the participating groups, 3-year EFS for the MAP regimen is 
expected to be 70% for good responders and 45% for poor responders; 5-year OS is also expected to be 
70% for good responders and 45% for poor responders. 
 
Setting a two-sided significance level of 5% and 80% power, around 525 events are required. Assuming 
400 patients registered per year, it is proposed that 1260 patients be randomized into EURAMOS-1.  The 
original planning parameters indicated that, of these, 567 were anticipated to be good responders and 693 
poor responders. Data that became available in September 2010 confirming the proportion of good:poor 
responders was, instead, around 53:47, rather than the expected 45:55. Previous data from COSS 
suggest ed that 10% of patients registered at the start of treatment are not randomized following surgery 
because of disease progression . In EURAMOS-1, the non randomization rate has been higher at around 
30-35% for many reasons, including disease progression, insufficient pre-operative chemotherapy and 
withdrawal of consent.  Thus enrollment will be extended to [ADDRESS_457647] an absolute improvement of 10% in good responders from 70% to 80% (hazard ratio 0.63), in 
3-year EFS and 5-year OS requires around [ADDRESS_457648] an absolute improvement 
of
 10% in poor responders, from 45% to 55% (hazard ratio 0.75), in 3-year EFS and 5-year OS requires 
around [ADDRESS_457649] 85% of patients randomized into EURAMOS [ADDRESS_457650] localized disease at 
registration. A minimum of 650 good responders with localized disease and 565 poor responders with 
localized disease may thus be available for analysis.  Due to the better prognosis for localized disease, 
EFS and OS are expected to be slightly higher for this cohort compared to the whole trial population. 
 
In good responders with localized disease, assuming a two-sided significance level of 5% and 80% 
power, [ADDRESS_457651] an improvement of 10%, from 75% to 85% (hazard ratio 0.56) in

it is expected to have reasonable power in the localized disease setting when the main analyses are 
performed. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_457653] ratios with appropriate 
confidence intervals. Proportions of patients experiencing grade 3 and 4 toxicities will be compared using 
chi-square tests or Fisher‟s exact tests where appropriate.  Differences in EFS and OS will be assessed for 
the subgroup of patients with localized disease.  No other subgroup analyses are planned but the 
consistency of treatment effect within specified groups, e.g. site of disease, will be examined. A full 
statistical analysis plan will be developed separately. 
 
10.5 Interim Analyses 
The data will be reviewed and formal interim analyses performed at regular intervals (approximately 6 
monthly) by [CONTACT_366033], 
together with results from other relevant trials, justifies continuing recruitment of further patients. 
 
A decision to discontinue recruitment, in all patients or in selected subgroups will be made only if the 
result is likely to convince a broad range of clinicians including participants in the trial and the general 
clinical community.  If a decision is made to continue, the IDMC will advise on the frequency of future 
reviews of the data on the basis of accrual and event rates. 
 
The Haybittle-Peto stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_365981] (Haybittle, 1971; Peto et al, 1976).  The 
trial will be stopped for good or poor responders if the p-value for the analysis of EFS is below 0.001.  
This approach has the advantage of not requiring the number of interim analyses to be specified, and not 
increasing the Type I error of the final analysis by [CONTACT_726] a nominal amount.  The IDMC will make 
recommendations to the TSC as to the continuation of the trial. 
 
It is important that interim analyses of EURAMOS-[ADDRESS_457654] been 
entered into it.  If, at interim analysis, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the proportion 
of patients in each arm who died due to toxicity exceeds 3%, the future of the trial will be discussed with 
the TSC.  The minimum number of toxic deaths for which the lower bound of the 95% CI exceeds 3% is  
shown in the table below.

At each interim analysis, all reported grade 4 CTCAE toxicities will be presented by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  Any perceived 
excess in grade 4 toxicity, in any arm, will lead to further investigation to determine the safety of that 
arm.  As the toxicity profiles of MAP and MAPIE are known from the results of INT 0133 and P9754, 
further stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_365982].  
 
The role of the TSC is to provide overall supervision for the trial and provide advice through its 
independent Chairman. The ultimate decision for the continuation of the trial lies with the TSC.  See 
Appendix A.1 for details on trial committees.

major acute or long-term toxicity in osteosarcoma (Strander et al, 1995).  Interferon-

safety record in other diseases, and we would not expect to see major toxicities arising from it in this trial.  
However, it would be prudent to monitor the safety of patients who receive pegylated interferon 
 -2b 
carefully. 
 
If any toxic death occurs that is attributable to pegylated interferon α-2b, the IDMC and TSC will be 
consulted within 7 days with a view to discontinuing this arm.  If, at interim analysis, > 25% of patients 
who started pegylated interferon α-2b have subsequently ceased treatment for any reason other than 
disease progression, relapse or death, the TMG will discuss whether to discontinue this arm with the 
IDMC and TSC.  Permanent, early discontinuation of pegylated interferon α-2b should be discussed with 
the regional PI [INVESTIGATOR_365985].  At interim analysis, all grade 4 toxicities observed during treatment 
with pegylated interferon α-2b will be reported.  If any individual non-hematological toxicity criterion is 
associated with grade 4 toxicity in more than 5% of patients, the continuation of this arm will be reviewed 
with the IDMC and TSC.

he desc
riptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_457656] access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0 and a copy can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_457657] of the maximal transverse dimensions (X, Y, and Z) as described: 
a. In the axial plane, find the imagine showing the largest area of tumor and measure the tumor 
in the longest dimension (X). 
b. On the same axial image, measure the tumor in longest dimension (Y) perpendicular to (X). 
c. Then, determine the length of the tumor (Z) in the longitudinal axis. 
The disease burden measurement is the product of X Y x Z. 
 
11.2.3 Complete Response (CR)   
Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
11.2.4 Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement, taking as reference the disease measurement done to 
confirm measurable disease at study entry. 
 
11.2.5 Progressive Disease (PD)   
 At least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease 
measurement recorded since the start of treatment IN ASSOCIATION WITH clinical features of 
progression such as increased pain, inflammatory signs, rising alkaline phosphatase. Clinical 
assessment must be repeated in no less than 3 weeks to be regarded as progressive disease. (OR)

12.[ADDRESS_457659] be reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier 
monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited 
reporting. 
 
12.2 Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an 
investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade  
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior experience  (expectedness) of 
the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253043].  
 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug Application 
(IND).  In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, but is actually being 
tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a commercial 
source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial 
agents for a trial. 
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply. 
 Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in combination with a 
commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and expedited 
reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for investigational agents. 
 Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent and a 
commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is given for a period of 
time prior to starting the investigational agent, expedited reporting of adverse events which 
occur prior to starting the investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial 
agents.  Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited reporting of 
adverse events follow the investigational agent reporting guidelines. 
 
12.3 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria v. 4.0 (CTCAE).   The 
CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed.  A copy of the 
CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov) . All appropriate treatment 
locations should have access to a copy of the CTCAE. 
 
Step 2 : Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST0331  
  Page 70 Step 3 : Determine the attribution of adverse event in relation to the protocol therapy.   Attribution 
ca
tegories are: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite. 
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.    
For investigational agents that are not commercially available and are being studied under a company‟s 
IND or an investigator held IND, expected AEs are usually based on the Investigator‟s Brochure.   
Guidance on expectedness of the agent is provided in the Drug Information Section of this protocol. 
 
Step 5 : Review Tables A and/or B  in this section to determine if: 
 there are any protocol-specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse 
events that require special monitoring ; and/or 
 there are any protocol-specific exceptions  to the reporting requirements. 
 
Step 6 : Determine if the protocol treatment given prior to the adverse event included an investigational 
agent, a commercial agent, or a combination of investigational and commercial agents.   
 
Note: If the patient received at least one dose of investigational agent, follow the guidelines in Table A.  
If no investigational agent was administered, follow the guidelines in Table B. 
 
12.4 Reporting methods  
 
 The reporting methods described below are specific for clinical trials evaluating agents for 
which the IND is held by [CONTACT_6744], an investigator, or a pharmaceutical company.  It is 
important to note that these procedures differ slightly from those used for reporting AEs for 
clinical trials for which CTEP holds the IND.   
 
 Use the NCI‟s Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS). The NCI‟s 
guidelines for AdEERS can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov . 
 
 An AdEERS report must be submitted by [CONTACT_7053]: 
 
- Electronically submit the report via the AdEERS Web-based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adeers.htm ,  
or
 
- If the AdEERS web-based application is unavailable , Fax to COG ([PHONE_7565];  
attention COG AE Coordinator) the completed NCI Adverse Event Expedited Report on the 
paper template.  
 Fax supporting documentation for AEs related to investigational agents  to: 
 COG (fax # [PHONE_7565]; attention: COG AE Coordinator).  
 DO NOT send the supporting documentation for AEs related to commercial agents to 
the NCI . Fax this material to COG (fax # [PHONE_7565]; attention: COG AE Coordinator).  
 ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed documents. 
 Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-specific patient ID provided during 
trial registration on all reports.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST0331  
  Page 71  
12.5 When to report an event in an expedited manner  
 
 Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours (refer to Table A) via e-mail to the 
COG AE Coordinator.  
 
 Submit the report within [ADDRESS_457660] reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to the drug company (for 
industry sponsored trials) and to the FDA (when COG holds the IND). 
 
Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the local policy and 
procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient. 
 
12.7 Reporting of Adverse Events for investigational  agents

Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study database.  For this study, routine reporting 
will include all Grade [ADDRESS_457665] 25, 2010, all secondary malignancies should be reported via AdEERS. 
 
 
13.0 RECORDS AND REPORTING 
 
13.1 Categories of Research Records 
Research records for this study can be divided into three categories: 
1. Non-computerized Information:  Pathology Narrative Reports, Surgical Reports.  These forms are 
submitted through the Document Imaging System in the eRDES. 
 
2. Reference Labs‟ required reports, and QARC data:  These data accompany submissions to these 
centers, which forward their review data electronically to the COG Statistics and Data Center. 
3. Computerized Information Electronically Submitted:  All other computerized data will be entered 
in the COG Remote Data Entry System with the aid of schedules and worksheets (essentially paper 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_174621]) provided in the data form packet. 
 
See separate Data Form Packet posted on the COG web site, which includes submission schedule. 
 
13.2 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) version 3.1.  Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due January 31, April 
30, July [ADDRESS_457666] without prior fixation.  
Enrollment on a COG osteosarcoma specimen collection study is strongly encouraged. 
 
14.2 Definitive Surgery   
For osteosarcoma, surgery is the local treatment of choice. Complete surgical removal of all affected sites 
is mandatory whenever feasible. Rapid central review will be done on the surgical specimen. 
 
14.2.1 Definitive Surgery of the Primary Tumor  
Surgery of the primary tumor is scheduled for 11 weeks after the commencement of chemotherapy. 
Surgery should be performed in a manner which guarantees wide or radical margins according to 
Enneking‟s classification. While it is most often possible to reach such margins without sacrificing the 
affected limb, mutilating surgery may become necessary if this is not the case. The indication for limb-
salvage must be made with particular caution if a poor tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy is 
anticipated by [CONTACT_366035]. Marginal or intralesional surgery 
should be avoided whenever possible and must be restricted to situations where wide or radical margins 
are not achievable by [CONTACT_61076]. As inappropriate surgery may easily lead to local recurrence and death 
in otherwise curable patients, it is strongly recommended that osteosarcoma surgery should only be 
performed in specialized centers.  
 
14.2.2 Definitive Surgery Guidelines  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prior to definitive surgery the following parameters are recommended: 
N
eutrophils >1.0 x 109/L 
Platelets > 80 x 109/L 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Indications for limb salvage surgery: 
 Tumor resectable with wide margins 
 Reconstruction possible and likely to be successful 
 Patient aware of risks/benefits of limb salvage 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Indications for amputation: 
 Inability to completely resect the tumor without leaving residual disease 
 Extensive involvement of neurovascular bundle 
 Patient preference 
 Timing of protocol therapy  administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care.  Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72  hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or d isease evaluations 
(and up to 1  week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure 
and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG Administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the  protocol).   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_457667] few complications. In some situations an amputation may give a better and more 
predictable result than attempts at reconstruction (e.g. distal tibia).  
 
The following reconstruction options represent standard treatment but are NOT meant to exclude other 
options: 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Distal Femur – in most cases use of an endoprosthesis will give a good result.  If the tumor involves the 
knee 
joint an extra-articular resection should be carried out.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Proximal Tibia - use of an endoprosthesis will work well if the extensor mechanism is reconstructed. A 
gastrocnemius muscle flap should be part of the soft tissue reconstruction. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Proximal Femur – modular endoprostheses work well. Because of the significant risk of dislocation a 
larg
e unipolar or bipolar head is recommended. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Proximal Humerus – reconstructive options include the use of a prosthesis, a fibula graft (vascularized) or 
a tur
n down of the clavicle (claviculo pro humero). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Pelvis – all surgical reconstructions are high risk and should be carried out at a center with appropriate 
expert
ise. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Diaphyseal tumor – When the joints can be spared above and below a tumor in a long bone then a 
biolog
ical reconstruction is preferred – either using an allograft or an autograft (or a combination) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Young
 children with long bone tumors – extendable endoprostheses have proved useful but have a 
signi
ficant risk of complications. Families must be fully informed about risks/benefits and the 
inevitability of the need for further surgery. Rotation plasty should be considered in these cases. 
IF THERE IS INSUFFICIENT LOCAL EXPERTISE, REFER TO A SURGICAL 
REPRESENTATIVE ON THE COG AOST0331 COMMITTEE 
 
14.2.4 Surgery of pelvic and other axial tumors  
Osteosarcomas arising in the axial skeleton (excluding craniofacial bones) which are deemed resectable 
with curative intent are eligible for inclusion in this protocol.  Subsequent surgical management of such 
tumors may include amputation (fore or hind quarter for shoulder girdle and pelvic tumors) or complex 
reconstruction.  The chosen approach should be anticipated to achieve the safest oncological margin and 
at least  macroscopic resection.

Enrollment on a COG osteosarcoma specimen collection study is strongly encouraged for all patients 
enrolled on AOST0331. Please see the specimen collection study for specific instructions on specimen 
preparation and shipment.  Fresh tissue is requested whenever possible. 
 
15.2 Resection/amputation  
Given the goals of the present trial, timely resection specimen analysis is of paramount importance. This 
means that at all times the handling of the resected specimens are of peak priority including the initial 
handling, decalcification, administration, and dispatching the material for central review.  
 
The examination has three objectives: 
1) Assessment of resection margins 
2) Assessment of the response to chemotherapy (See Section 15.3) 
3) Estimation of the amount of cartilaginous differentiation being more or less than 30% of the tumor 
volume. 
 
To provide documentation of the soft tissue margins, the initial gross examination should be performed 
on the fresh specimen. Measurement of the narrowest resection margin (mm) is of most value.  
Histological sections should be taken in any area where excision margins appear dubious. Ideally, the 
specimen should be prepared by [CONTACT_366037], and 
the whole  of this slab should be divided into blocks for preparation of histological sections. Radiological 
imaging of the specimen is of value in determining the maximum tumor diameter. A photograph and a 
diagrammatic map of the specimen should be prepared indicating the site of individual blocks. For 
quantitating the effects of chemotherapy only the sections where tumor was present or was thought to 
have been present should be assessed. Normal adjacent bone and soft tissue areas should not be included 
in the area quantitated. If there is difficulty in handling specimens at any stage the review pathologists are 
anxious to help. 
 
Sections from each block encompassing the largest diameter of the resected tumor (not the complete 
specimen) will be required by a review pathologist.  
 
With Amendment #3, institutional assessment of histologic response will be used to determine whether 
the patient meets the criteria for randomization within 35 days of the surgical procedure. However, every 
effort should be made to obtain Rapid central review of the surgical material to assess histologic response 
and provide the required materials to the BPC within 21 days of the resection/amputation in order to 
complete the review within 35 days of the surgical procedure.  
 
Please label all materials with the patient‟s COG Patient Identification Number and the surgical pathology 
ident
ification (SPID) from the corresponding institutional pathology report(s). 
 
Materials required at the time of resection/amputation: 
 Representative paraffin blocks with tumor or if blocks are unavailable send [ADDRESS_457670] diameter of the resected tumor. 
 One H&E stained slide from each tumor block of the resected specimens 
 Map indicating from which point sections are taken  
 A copy of the institutional pathology report(s) which includes measurement of the tumor in two

15.3 Procedure for Quantitation  
The amount of viable tumor is reported as less than 10% of the tumor area in cases showing a good 
response and greater than or equal to 10% in cases showing a poor response.  
 
In most cases, the amount of viable remnant tumor is obvious (<10% vital or nearly all vital).  In these 
instances, one can assign response to one of the above-mentioned categories. For problematic (non-
obvious) cases, graph paper with 2mm squares can be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_530] (actual size) on to acetate sheets for 
overhead projection. This may be cut into rectangles and fixed over the cover slip using double-sided 
Sellotape. The entire tumor-bearing areas can thus be measured and totaled.  
 
The same method may be used for quantifying the amount of cartilaginous differentiation.  When more 
than 30% of an osteosarcoma is composed of chondroblastic areas, intimately associated and mixed with 
non-chondroid-elements it is considered as chondroblastic osteosarcoma.  Viable chondroblastic areas are 
characteristically composed of nodular, bluish hyaline cartilage, with moderately to severely pleomorphic 
malignant cells. The microscopic appearance is of chondrosarcoma grade 2-3. Necrotic cartilaginous 
areas are recognized as a confluent, very pale to light eosinophilic homogeneous matrix with vesicular-
appearing lacunae in which shadows of necrotic cells can be seen. Grossly, an overt chondroid 
appearance is rare so the diagnosis is made on histology.  
 
 
16.[ADDRESS_457671] chemotherapy in this protocol is well recognized but 
additional toxicities may be anticipated with the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide for poor responders 
(MAPIE) and with pegylated interferon alfa-2b for good responders. 
 
The 
main objective of QL assessment within AOST0331 is to determine the impact on QL (both short- 
and long-term) for two interventions in two groups of patients: (1) poor responders: the impact of the 
addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to the standard chemotherapy; and (2) good responders: the impac t 
of maintenance therapy with interferon.  Describing and comparing the impact of these regimens on QL 
will lead to a better understanding, from the patients‟ perspective, of the nature of treatment related side-
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST0331  
  Page 79 effects, both short- and long-term.  These data will help define future treatment options for these patients.  
Additionally, the assessment of QL within EURAMOS 1 will allow more global concerns to be 
addressed, for example whether QL is affected by [CONTACT_366038], patient maturity (emotional and 
physical) and other characteristics such as gender, and site of primary tumor.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_457672] a parent questionnaire. For patients aged 15 and under 
the Peds QL questionnaire will be used, which has been validated in North America, but not in all 
European languages.2 Peds QL has questionnaires for three age groups: 5-[ADDRESS_457673] QOL Time Point:  1st QOL assessment for child (and parent if applicable) is to be

treatment) 
o 4th QOL Time Point: 4th QOL assessment at week 144+/- 4 weeks (3 years after the start 
of treatment) 
 
Once completed, QL forms should be returned to the COG Statistics and Data Center. The COG Patient 
Identification number and date of completion sh ould be recorded on each form. 
 
 
17.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING 
 
 Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies , and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care.  Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72  hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations 
(and up to 1  week for sur gery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure 
and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG Administrative Policy 5.14 (except where

procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG Administrative Policy 5.14 
(excep t where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_457679] be completed and submitted to QARC. The benchmark 
material is available from the QARC website ( www.qarc.org ).   
 
18.1.1 Equipment  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modality 
X-rays with nominal energy of 4 MV or greater. Co-60 is not allowed on this study. Proton Radiation is 
not allowed on this study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Calibration 
The calibration of therapy machines used in this protocol shall be verified by [CONTACT_366040] (RPC). 
 
18.1.2 Target Volume Definitions  
ICRU- 50 and 62 prescription methods and nomenclature shall be utilized for this study.   
 
Gross Tumor Volume  (GTV): The GTV is the gross tumor, either palpable or visible/demonstrable by 
[CONTACT_15218]. Its delineation should preferentially be done in collaboration with a radiologist. 
Clinical Target Volume  (CTV): The CTV contains the demonstrable GTV and/or sub-clinical 
microscopic malignant disease. Original tumor extension should guide the delineation of CTV. Ideally 
this should be done in collaboration with the treating surgeon. In axial tumors a safety margin of 2 cm 
added to GTV should be attempted.  For an extremity osteosarcoma a margin of 4-5 cm may be advisable.  
Planning Target Volume  (PTV): For the purpose of this study, a margin for set up error or patient 
movement is to be added to the Clinical Target Volume. The PTV for this study will be 0.5 to 1.0 cm. 
 
18.1.3 Target Dose  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prescription Point 
The prescription point is at or near the isocenter. If IMRT is used, dose may be prescribed to an isodose 
surface that encompasses the PTV provided that the dose uniformity requirements in Section [IP_ADDRESS] are 
satisfied. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Definition 
Dose is specified in Gy to muscle. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST0331  
  Page 83 [IP_ADDRESS] Tissue Heterogeneity 
Density corrections are not required, however, inhomogeneity correction for air or bone attenuation may be 
applied. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_365989]-based treatment planning where radiation dose 
distributions and treatment calculations are automatically generated based upon the CT densities of the 
treatment-planning scan. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prescription Dose and Fractionation 
The patients treated with post-operative irradiation  should receive a total dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy fractions 
where margins are microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_365990] 66 Gy where macroscopic tumor tissue is left behind. 
For definitive radiotherapy  of an inoperable osteosarcoma a radiation dose of 70 Gy should always be 
attempted. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Uniformity 
A maximum dose variation within the PTV between 95-105% according to the dose plan should be 
attempted. Hot spots outside the PTV with a maximum of 110% are acceptable only if total volume is less 
than 10 cm3. Moreover, single hot spots  should not exceed 5 cm3. Wedges, compensators, beam 
segmentation, and other methods of generating a uniform dose distribution are encouraged. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Rests/interruptions 
There are no planned rests on this study. In case of holidays or machine breakdowns, the overall treatment 
time might be extended where the indication is adjuvant, whereas in case of macroscopic tumor tissue 
compensation by [CONTACT_366041] (separated by a minimum of 6 hours on a treatment day) should 
be considered. This may not be appropriate where spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brachial or lumbar plexus is in the high 
dose volume.  Please justify in the comments any interruptions for greater than three treatment days.   
 
18.1.4 Treatment Technique  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Volume-based (CT scan) treatment planning is required in this protocol.  Techniques which shield/protect 
normal tissue are essential providing that they do not compromise treatment of the PTV.  The use of 
IMRT is allowed.  Fields should be chosen to minimize dose to organs at risk as defined in section 18.1.5.  
Multiple beam techniques, both coplanar and non-coplanar may be used to achieve the objective.  If the 
target volume extends to the surface of the patient, adequate dose coverage should be obtained using 
bolus material rather than a mixed beam technique. Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) and 
brachytherapy are also allowed on this study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] IORT 
If IORT is delivered, the electron energy chosen must insure appropriate target dose at both the surface 
and at depth. The electron energy will be calculated to the 90% line. Bolus may be permitted to insure 
appropriate surface dose. The IORT Physics Reporting Form and RT-[ADDRESS_457680] study. IORT may be delivered at the time of primary surgical 
excision. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Brachytherapy 
Both high dose rate (multiple fractions acceptable) and low dose rate techniques are permitted for this 
study. If multiple fractions are chosen for high dose rate, the total dose should remain as stated in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The dose should be calculated to a [ADDRESS_457681] two planes is 
required for submission and review. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Position 
Reproducible setups are critical and the use of immobilization devices is strongly encouraged.

18.1.5
 Organs at Risk: 
All structures that may be associated with serious late toxicity should be delineated and dose-volume-
histograms generated. The following maximum radiation doses should be respected:  
Cervical cord (more that 5 cm length): [ADDRESS_457682] (less 5 cm): 50 Gy 
Brain tissue: 60 Gy 
Optic nerve/chiasm: 50 Gy 
Intestine: 50 Gy, depending on volume  
Liver: 
Whole liver 20Gy: If less than ¼ volume is irradiated, 50 Gy 
Kidney: 20 Gy (> 1/3) 
Heart: 30 Gy 
Lung: 20 – 60 Gy depending on volume  
Urinary bladder: [ADDRESS_457683] 
be submitted.  The benchmark material can be obtained from QARC (www.QARC.org). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prescribed Dose 
For 3D conformal techniques:  The monitor units required to deliver the prescribed dose must be 
submitted using the RT-1 Dosimetry Summary Form for each field.  
 
For IMRT techniques: The monitor units required to deliver the prescribed dose shall be calculated and 
submitted using the IMRT Dosimetry Summary Form. The monitor units generated by [CONTACT_366042]‟s first treatment.  Measurements in a 
QA phantom can suffice for a check as long as the plan‟s fluence distributions can be recomputed for a 
phantom geometry. 
 
 
For IORT: The IORT Physics Reporting Form shall be submitted. 
 
For brachytherapy: The Brachytherapy Physics Reporting Form shall be submitted. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Uniformity 
The maximum and minimum doses in the PTV shall be calculated and reported. These may be extracted 
from isodose distributions, calculated separately or derived from DVH‟s. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Critical Organs 
Dose volume histograms for the critical organs indicated in section 18.1.5 shall be calculated whenever 
the critical organs are included in the radiation therapy treatment fields. The appropriate dose volume 
histograms shall be submitted with the QA documentation.

  Page 85  
[IP_ADDRESS] Isodose Distribution 
A hard copy isodose distribution for the total dose plan in the axial, sagittal and coronal planes at the 
center of the planning target volume must be submitted.  These dose distributions must include the 
following: 
A sufficient number of isodose contours should be shown to determine that the dose distribution 
conforms to the protocol guidelines.   These isodoses should be superimposed over treatment 
planning CT images.  However, if such hard copy presents difficulty, similar plots without gray 
scale image are acceptable if enough critical contours are identifiable to verify the dose 
distribution to target volumes and critical normal structures.  Specifically, include those volumes 
for which there are dose volume histograms. 
 
18.1.7 Quality Assurance Documentation  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  
Within three days of the start of radiotherapy, the following data for 3D or IMRT plans shall be submitted

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY AOST0331 (EURAMOS 1) 
(for children 7 through 12 years of age) 
 
 A Treatment Study for Children with Osteosarcoma Based on Tumor Response to 
Chemotherapy Given Before Surgery 
 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your bone tumor(s), called osteosarcoma. After doing 
tests we have found you have this kind of tumor. 
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study to try a new way of treating your 
osteosarcoma. A research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help 
people who are sick. In this study, we are trying a new way to treat osteosarcoma. 
 
3. Children who are part of this study will have two parts to their treatment. One part will be to 
get chemotherapy (a medicine that kills cancer cells), and then have an operation (surgery) 
to remove the tumor(s). The second part will be to start a new chemotherapy plan. Which 
new plan you get will depend on how well the earlier chemotherapy worked for you.  
 
4. In the second part of the study you will be randomly assigned to get either the same 
chemother apy you received in the first part or you will receive the same therapy plus new 
drug. This is called Randomization. This is a lot like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. A computer decides 
which chemotherapy plan you will be on, not you or your doctor. The reason for this is to 
make sure there are the same number of people on both treatments. Studies like this are 
done to learn which type of treatment works best. We do not know if one treatment is better 
than another .  
 
5. Something called a central line is often used for children getting chemotherapy into a vein, 
so they can receive chemotherapy through it instead of getting poked by a needle. A central 
line is a special type of tubing that is put into a large vein in your chest. If you have a central 
line you should not have to get poked too many times to get chemotherapy or have blood 
samples taken. 
 
6. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These 
good things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is 
that the treatment you get will help make your health better. If you get one of the 
experimental treatments, we hope the experimental treatment will be better at getting rid of 
the cancer than the normal treatment. But, we don’t know for sure if there is any benefit of 
being part of this study. 
 
7. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad 
things are called “risks.” If you get one of the experimental treatments, a risk to you from this 
study is that you may have more side effects from the experimental treatment. Other risks 
are that your treatment will take longer to complete and may not be any better than the 
normal treatment in getting rid of the cancer. Other things may happen to you that we don’t 
yet know abou t. 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE [ADDRESS_457689] to agree to answer these questions to be a 
part of this study. After you get your chemotherapy, you will be checked regularly in the clinic 
to see how well the drugs are working and to answer the questions about how you feel.

 A Treatment Study for Children and Teens with Osteosarcoma Based on Tumor Response to 
Chemotherapy Given Before Surgery 
 
 
1. We have been talking with you about your bone tumor(s), called osteosarcoma. After 
doing tests we have found you have this kind of tumor. 
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have osteosarcoma.  A 
research study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who 
are sick. In this study, we are trying to a new way to treat osteosarcoma. 
 
3. Children and teens who are part of this study will receive treatment in two parts. One 
part will be to get chemotherapy (a medicine that kills cancer cells), and then have an 
operation (surgery) to remove the tumor(s).  
 
The second part will be to start a new chemotherapy plan, which will be determined by 
[CONTACT_366044]: 
 If the chemotherapy worked really well (90% or more of the cancer cells were 
destroyed), you will either continue with the same chemotherapy OR get the 
same chemotherapy PLUS one new drug.  
 If the chemotherapy worked not so well (fewer than 90% of the cancer cells were 
destroyed), you will either continue with the same chemotherapy OR get the 
same chemotherapy PLUS two new chemotherapy drugs.  
 If the chemotherapy did not affect the cancer cells at all, your doctor will take you 
off this study and develop a new treatment plan for you.  
 
4. The second part of the study is called a randomized study, because you will be randomly 
assigned to get one treatment plan or the other. This is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin and saying, 
“Heads means I get the same chemotherapy, but tails means I get the same 
chemotherapy AND something new,” except that a computer will determine which 
chemotherapy plan you would be on.  The decision about which treatment you receive is 
not made by [CONTACT_366045]. The reason for this is to make sure there are the 
same number of people on both treatments. Studies like this are done to learn which 
type of treatment works best. We do not know if one treatment is better than another.  
 
5. Something called a central line is often used for people getting chemotherapy into a 
vein, so they can receive chemotherapy through it instead of getting poked by a needle. 
A central line is a special type of tubing that is put into a large vein in your chest. If you 
have a central line you should not have to get poked to get chemotherapy or have blood 
samples taken. 
 
6. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These 
good things are called “benefits.” We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this 
study is that the treatment you get will help make your health better. If you get one of the 
experimental treatments, we hope the experimental treatment will be better at getting rid 
of the cancer than the standard treatment. But, we don’t know for sure if there is any 
benefit of being part of this study. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AOST0331  
  Page 94  
 
7. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These 
bad things are called “risks.” If you get one of the experimental treatments, a risk to you 
from this study is that you may have more side effects from the experimental treatment.  
Other risks are that the experimental treatment will take longer to complete and may not 
be any better than the standard treatment in getting rid of the cancer. Other things may 
happen to you that we don’t yet know about. 
 
8. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not. Your family can also decide to 
stop being in this study at any time once you start. There may be other treatments for 
your illness that your doctor can tell you about. Make sure to ask your doctors any 
questions that you have. 
 
9. We are also asking your permission to save some of the tumor tissue that was taken 
during your operation to use for future research about cancer and other diseases. You 
do not have to agree to let us save this tissue to be a part of this study. 
 
10. We are also asking you to answer some questions about what your life is like and how 
you feel about your diagnosis and treatment. We would ask these questions [ADDRESS_457690] to agree to answer these 
questions to be a part of this study. After you get your chemotherapy, you will be 
checked regularly in the clinic to see how well the drugs are working and to answer the 
questions about how you feel.

If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child who may take part in this study, 
permission from you is required and the assent (agreement) of your child may be 
required.  When we say “you” in this consent form, we mean you or your child; “we” means the 
doctors and other staff.  
 
PART 1- INDUCTION THERAPY 
This study is a clinical trial (a research study involving human subjects). Clinical trials only 
include individuals who choose to take part in them. Please take your time to make your 
decision.  Discuss your decision with your friends and family. 
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have osteosarcoma, a form of 
cancer that develops in bone. Osteosarcoma is the most common cancerous bone tumor in 
children and young adults. Study doctors would like to find out how best to treat subjects with 
osteosarcoma by [CONTACT_366047]-cancer drugs.  
The EURAMOS [ADDRESS_457692] high grade tumor that can 
be removed by [CONTACT_44850]; high grade tumor means that the osteosarcoma tumor cells grow very 
fast. The tumors must be in the legs, arms, or backbone, and can still be in the place(s) where 
they first started (this is called localized disease) or can have spread to other places in the body 
(this is called metastatic disease) as long as all the tumors can be taken out with surgery. 
 
Why is this study being done? 
This study is being done to try to find out the best way to treat osteosarcoma subjects who have 
tumors that can be removed by [CONTACT_44850]. The standard anti-cancer drugs used to treat subjects 
with osteosarcoma are doxorubicin, cisplatin, and methotrexate (together called MAP). In 
previous research studies using MAP study doctors found that by [CONTACT_289540][INVESTIGATOR_366002] a microscope after some MAP has been given, they can estimate how many tumor cells 
have been killed; if the tumor cells are almost all destroyed (about 90% or more, called a good 
response), there is a good chance that the tumor will go away if we continue to use these 
standard drugs. If the tumor cells are not as easily killed by [CONTACT_366048] (less than 90% of the cells 
killed, called a poor response), the chance that the disease will go away is not as good, 
meaning the tumor is more likely to return later. 
 
For subjects who have a poor tumor response to MAP, study doctors would like to find out if 
adding two other common anti-cancer drugs (ifosfamide and etoposide) to MAP will help get rid 
of the tumor in more subjects. We do not know if adding ifosfamide and etoposide to the MAP 
regimen will increase the chance of getting rid of the tumor. Ifosfamide and etoposide have 
been chosen for use in this study because in some previous studies of children with metastatic 
   AOST0331 
  Page [ADDRESS_457693] a good tumor response to MAP therapy, study doctors would like to 
know if adding a “biologic” drug, interferon, after MAP, will help make sure the tumor cells do not 
return later. Interferon is produced naturally in the body. The exact way interferon works is not 
known; it may directly kill cancer cells, or it may interfere with the blood supply to the tumor, or it 
may make the body’s immune system work better (the immune system recognizes and destroys 
“foreign” cells). This study will use pegylated interferon alfa-2b, interferon that has been 
modified to last longer in the body so it can be given less often. The use of interferon was 
shown in some previous studies of subjects with other diseases to increase the time before the 
disease came back: we do not know if giving interferon will increase the chance of getting rid of 
the tumor for subjects with osteosarcoma.  Adding pegylated interferon alfa-2b after the MAP 
chemotherapy treatment is experimental. 
 
Because this study will have a large number of subjects treated in the same ways, study doctors 
will be able to tell if these drugs do improve the outcome for subjects with osteosarcoma. It is 
important to study the addition of these chemotherapy drugs and the biologic drugs because the 
addition of these drugs will also add side effects and lengthen the total amount of treatment 
time. 
 
The aims of this study are, then: 
 To see if the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide to MAP chemotherapy will help 
get rid of the disease in subjects who have a poor tumor response to MAP alone. 
 To see if the addition of interferon after MAP chemotherapy can help get rid of the 
disease in subjects who have a good tumor response to standard chemotherapy. 
 
Study doctors would also like to look at the tumor tissue to see if there are things about the 
genetic make-up of these tumors that can be used to predict how subjects will respond to 
therapy. Study doctors would also like to know how the disease and the therapy affect the lives 
of subjects and their families. 
 
How many people will take part in the study? 
There will be about 23 00 subjects taking part in this study. 
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
Before you begin the study …  
If you take part in this study, you will have the following tests and procedures. These are part of 
regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join in this study:  
 History and physical examination 
 Blood tests 
 Urine tests 
 Pregnancy Test* 
 Echocardiogram (pi[INVESTIGATOR_366003]) 
 MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of disease sites 
 X-ray of disease sites and the chest 
 CT scan (an X-ray procedure) of disease sites and the chest 
 Bone Scan (pi[INVESTIGATOR_366004]) 
 Audiogram (hearing test) 
 Nuclear Medicine Scans  
* Given to females of childbearing age prior to treatment  
   AOST0331 
  Page 98 Because you are in this study we will want to know your view of how your life has been affected 
by [CONTACT_284897]. You will be asked to fill out some questionnaires; these are called 
Quality of Life Assessments; they will be done after you have had about 6 weeks of 
chemotherapy, about three months after surgery, at 18 months after the start of all the study 
therapy, and at 3 years after the start of all the study therapy. It will take about 10 minutes to 
complete the questionnaires; if your child is on this study, you and your child will be given 
different questionnaires. You do not have to take part in these Quality of Life assessments to be 
part of this research study. 
 
All subjects who are enrolled on this study will begin treatment with the standard drugs for 
osteosarcoma therapy: doxorubicin, cisplatin and methotrexate (MAP). Following [ADDRESS_457694] surgery to take out the tumor(s). The tumor tissue will be 
looked at under a microscope to find out how many of the tumor cells have been killed; briefly, if 
90% or more of the tumor cells have been killed, this will be called a good tumor response.  If 
less than 90% of the tumor cells have been killed, this will be called a poor tumor response.  If 
there is no change in the tumor, you will be taken off therapy and other treatment options will be 
discussed. 
 
The therapy you will get on the second part of the study will depend on whether you have a 
good or a poor tumor response, and then will depend on randomization to one of two different 
treatment regimens. Randomization means that you are being put into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. It is 
like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. Which group you are put in is done by a computer. Neither you nor the 
researcher will choose which group you will be put in. You will have an equal chance of being 
placed in any group . Your study doctor will discuss the treatments with you and you will be 
asked to sign another consent for the second part of the study. Your study doctor may think that 
you need to start chemotherapy after your surgery and before all the information is known for 
the randomization. In this case, you will start on a cycle of MAP chemotherapy before signing 
the consent for the randomized part of the study.

surgeon during a short operation. The central line is used to administer chemotherapy drugs 
and to withdraw small amounts of blood for testing during treatment. How the tubing is inserted 
and all the risks associated with central lines will be explained to you, and all of your questions 
about the central line will be answered, when you sign a separate consent for the central line. 
 
Surgery  
Subjects on this study will undergo surgery after Induction chemotherapy. You will be asked to 
sign a separate consent form for the surgical procedure. The planned surgery will be explained 
to you and your questions about it answered by [CONTACT_366051]. 
 
Some of the tissue already taken to make your diagnosis will be sent to a central review center 
as part of COG quality control; there will also be central review of the slides used to find out how 
many cancer cells have been killed after the induction therapy with MAP. 
 
Radiation therapy  
A small number of subjects on this study may need to have radiation therapy to help control the 
tumor; this would only be done if the tumor cannot be completely taken out with surgery. You 
will be asked to sign a separate consent for the radiation therapy. All your questions about the 
radiation therapy will be answered and the procedure explained when you sign the consent for 
radiation therapy. 
 
 
How long will I be in the study? 
 
We think if you complete therapy with MAP alone on this study, the treatment will last for about

side effects from the treatment that are too bad. 
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
 
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101409].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  
 
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_366005]. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking 
about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.

While on Part 1 of this study you are at risk for the side effects known about MAP therapy 
listed in the attached Appendix. You should discuss these with the study doctor and/or 
your regular doctor. There are other drugs that may be given to make the side effects of 
the drugs less serious and uncomfortable. There are no additional risks to you from the 
MAP therapy on Part [ADDRESS_457698] shortly after the study drugs are stopped, but in some cases 
side effects can be serious, long lasting, permanent, or even fatal.  You will be watched 
closely and the drugs will be stopped if bad side effects develop. Finally, a few subjects 
who survive cancer develop a second form of cancer.  
 
Surgical risks:  
The surgeon will talk to you about the risks of the surgery when you sign the consent for surgery 
after induction chemotherapy. In general, surgery may result in one or more of the following side 
effects: bleeding, infection, problems with wound healing, pain, scar, adhesions, loss of nerve or 
organ function, or blood vessel damage. Depending on the type of anesthesia required, there 
may be one or more of the following side effects: nausea, vomiting, air passage obstruction, 
breathing problems, or heart irregularity. In rare instances death may occur during or after 
surgery. 
 
 
Reproductive Risks  
For Women : 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child . You should not become pregnant or 
breast feed your baby [CONTACT_238088].  If you are sexually active and are at 
risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid 
pregnancy or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable 
methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will have to use the 
chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you 
are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish 
the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to avoid 
pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible 
means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation.  If you have questions about this or 
want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If you 
become pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your regular doctor 
immediately. 
 
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby [CONTACT_238089]. You may 
need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your 
doctors about the length of time you need to avoid nursing.

  Page 102 For Men : 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm .  You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child.  If you are sexually active and are 
at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid 
pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about the 
acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will 
have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the 
whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even 
after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to 
avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be 
permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions 
about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your 
doctor.  If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor 
and your regular doctor immediately. 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study? 
 
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. While doctors hope the drug 
therapy in this study will be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment, there 
is no proof of this yet. We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn 
more about treating osteosarcoma. This information could help future cancer patients. 
 
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? 
Instead of being on this study, you have these options: 
 The standard treatment for osteosarcoma, which is chemotherapy with doxorubicin, cisplatin 
and methotrexate (MAP) without being on this study 
 Another experimental treatment (if available) 
 
 
Please discuss these options with your regular doctor as well as other trusted personal and 
family advisors.

Consent to take part in Quality of Life Assessment research:  
We want to know your view of how your life has been affected by [CONTACT_284897]. This 
“Quality of Life” study looks at how you feel, physically and emotionally, during the cancer 
treatment. It also looks at how your family adapts to the cancer treatment. This information will 
help doctors and nurses better understand how subjects and families feel during treatments and 
what effects the medicines are having. 
You will be asked to complete surveys at 4 time points: after you have had about 6 weeks of 
chemotherapy, about three months after surgery, 18 months after the start of study therapy, and 
3 years after the start of study therapy. If your child is on this study, you and your child will be 
given different questionnaires. It takes about 10 minutes to fill out the questionnaires and this 
usually can be done during a clinic visit.   
 
If any questions make you (or your child) feel uncomfortable, you (or your child) may skip those 
questions and not give an answer. 
 
If you agree to take part in the Health Related Quality of Life Assessment, we will do our best to 
make sure that your answers to the questionnaires are kept private.   
 
You may change your mind about completing the questionnaires at any time. If you change your 
mind, please let the study doctor know and you will not be given any more questionnaires. 
 
Please circle your answer. After circling “yes “or “no” please write your initials in the space

study. Because your tumor has shown a good response to the MAP therapy in Part 1 (more 
than 90% of the tumor cells have been killed) you are eligible to be randomized to get either 
more MAP chemotherapy or MAP chemotherapy plus pegylated interferon alfa-2b. 
 
Continuing with MAP therapy alone should result in a very good outcome, but study doctors 
would like to know if adding the “biologic” drug interferon, after all MAP therapy is complete, will 
help make sure the tumor cells do not return later.   Adding pegylated interferon alfa-2b after 
MAP chemotherapy treatment is experimental.  
 
This study will use pegylated interferon alfa-2b, interferon that has been modified to last longer 
in the body so it can be given less often.   
 
How many people will take part in the study? 
There will be about 706 subjects with a good tumor response continuing on to Part 2 of the 
study. 
 
What will happen if I take part in this part of the research study?   
You will be assigned to one of the two treatments by [CONTACT_17628].  Randomization means that 
you are being put into a group by [CONTACT_3364].  It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. Which group you are put in is 
done by a computer. Neither you nor the study doctor will choose which group you will be put in.  
You will have an equal chance of being placed in any group.  You will be randomized to get 
continued standard treatment with MAP or treatment with MAP and then pegylated interferon 
alfa-2b (MAPi[INVESTIGATOR_365940]); this is called maintenance therapy . 
 
If you join in Part 2, you will also continue to have common medical tests to help your doctor find 
out about your health and how the treatment is going.  These tests are part of regular cancer 
care and may be done even if you do not join in this study: 
 History and physical examination 
 Blood tests 
 Urine tests 
 Echocardiogram (pi[INVESTIGATOR_366003]) 
 MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of disease sites 
   AOST0331 
  Page [ADDRESS_457702] scan (an X-ray procedure) of disease sites and the chest 
 Bone Scan (pi[INVESTIGATOR_366004]) 
 Audiogram (hearing test) 
 Nuclear Medicine Scans  
 
Methods for Giving Drugs  
Various methods will be used to give the drugs to you (your child). Some drugs may be given by 
[CONTACT_366055] (oral).  Some drugs may be given using a needle inserted just 
under the skin (subcutaneous). Other drugs may be given using a needle inserted into a vein (IV 
or intravenous). 
 
The drugs for the study are given in this way:

Central Line  
For drugs to be given by [CONTACT_59570], your study doctor will likely recommend that you (your child) have 
a central venous line placed. A central line is a type of tubing inserted into a large vein in the 
chest by a surgeon during a short operation. The central line is used to administer 
chemotherapy drugs and to withdraw small amounts of blood for testing during treatment. How 
the tubing is inserted and all the risks associated with central lines will be explained to you, and 
all of your questions about the central line will be answered, when you sign a separate consent 
for the central line. 
 
How long will I be in the study? 
 
If you join in the second part of the study, we think you will be treated for about 7 months if 
randomized to MAP therapy alone, and about 7 months for the basic chemotherapy plus up to 
two years of therapy with weekly pegylated interferon alfa-2b (as long as there is benefit) if 
randomized to the pegylated interferon alfa-2b therapy. . After treatment, subjects will have 
follow-up examinations and medical tests. We will continue to collect some medical information 
about how you are doing for [ADDRESS_457703] 
side effects from the treatment that are too bad 
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
 
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101409]. He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  
 
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_366005]. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking 
about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
 
While on this part of the study you are at risk for the side effects listed in Appendix I for MAP 
therapy as you were in Part 1. You should discuss these with the study doctor and/or your 
regular doctor.  
 
If you are randomized to get pegylated interferon alfa-2b, you will be at risk for additional side 
effects. The length of treatment will be longer and the drug may not improve the chance that the 
disease will go away. You will be watched closely and the pegylated interferon alfa-2b will be 
stopped if bad side effects develop.

For Women : 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child.   You should not become pregnant 
or breast feed your baby [CONTACT_238088].  If you are sexually active and are at 
risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid 
pregnancy or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable 
methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will have to use the 
chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you 
are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish 
the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to avoid 
pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible 
means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation.  If you have questions about this or 
want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If you 
become pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your regular doctor 
immediately. 
 
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby [CONTACT_238089]. You may 
need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your 
doctors about the length of time you need to avoid nursing. 
 
For Men : 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm .  You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child.  If you are sexually active and are 
at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid 
pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about the 
acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will 
have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the 
whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even 
after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to 
avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be 
permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions 
about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your 
doctor.  If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor 
and your regular doctor immediately. 
 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study? 
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  While doctors hope that 
interferon will be more useful against cancer compared to the usual treatment, there is no proof 
of this yet. We do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about  
osteosarcoma.  This information could help future cancer patients. 
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  
 
Instead of being on this study, you have these options: 
 The standard treatment for osteosarcoma which is chemotherapy with doxorubicin, 
cisplatin and methotrexate (MAP) without being on this study. 
 Another experimental treatment (if available)

The Children's Oncology Group has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
federal government, which will help us protect the privacy of our research subjects.  The 
Certificate protects against the involuntary release of information about subjects 
collected during the course of our covered studies.  The researchers involved in the 
studies cannot be forced to disclose the identity or any information collected in the study 
in any legal proceedings at the federal, state, or local level, regardless of whether they 
are criminal, administrative, or legislative proceedings.  However, the subject or the 
researcher may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected information under certain 
circumstances.  For example, if the subject or his/her guardian requests the release of 
information in writing, the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary disclosure.  
Furthermore, federal agencies may review our records under limited circumstances, 
such as a DHHS request for information for an audit or program evaluation or an FDA 
request under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act.  
The Certificate of Confidentiality will not protect against the required reporting by 
[CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_366007], reportable communicable 
diseases, and/or possible threat of harm to self or others.

SAMPLE INFORMED CONSENT/PARENTAL PERMISSION FOR PARTICIPATION IN 
RESEARCH  
 
AOST0331, A Randomized Trial of the European and American Osteosarcoma Study 
Group to Optimize Treatment Strategies for Resectable Osteosarcoma Based on 
Histologic Response to Pre-Operative Chemotherapy(EURAMOS 1) 
 
PART 2 – For subjects with a poor tumor response to Induction Therapy 
 
 
Why is this part of the study being done? 
Now that you have finished Part 1 of therapy you are being asked to continue on Part 2 of the 
study. Because your tumor had a poor response to induction chemotherapy (less than 90% of 
the tumor cells have been killed) you are eligible for more treatment with MAP chemotherapy or 
MAP chemotherapy plus ifosfamide and etoposide. 
 
Continuing with MAP therapy may still result in a good outcome, but study doctors would like to 
know if adding two other commonly used anti-cancer drugs (ifosfamide and etoposide) to MAP 
will improve the outcome and prevent the disease from returning later. Adding ifosfamide and 
etoposide to the MAP chemotherapy treatment is experimental. 
 
How many people will take part in the study? 
There will be about 615 subjects with a poor tumor response continuing on to Part 2 of the 
study. 
 
What will happen if I take part in this part of the research study? 
You will be assigned to one of the two treatments by [CONTACT_17628].  Randomization means that 
you are being put into a group by [CONTACT_3364].  It is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. Which group you are put in is 
done by a computer. Neither you nor the study doctor will choose which group you will be put in.  
You will have an equal chance of being placed in any group.  You will be randomized to get 
continued standard treatment with MAP alone or treatment with MAP and the addition of 
ifosfamide and etoposide (MAPIE). This is called maintenance therapy. 
 
If you join in Part 2, you will also continue to have common medical tests to help your doctor find 
out about your health and how the treatment is going.  These tests are part of regular cancer 
care and may be done even if you do not join in this study: 
 History and physical examination 
 Blood tests 
 Urine tests 
 Echocardiogram (pi[INVESTIGATOR_366003]) 
 MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of disease sites  
 X-ray of disease sites and the chest 
 CT scan (an X-ray procedure) of disease sites and the chest 
   AOST0331 
  Page 126 
 Bone Scan (pi[INVESTIGATOR_366004]) 
 Audiogram (hearing test) 
 Nuclear Medicine Scans  
 
Methods for Giving Drugs  
Various methods will be used to give the drugs to you (your child). Some drugs may be given by 
[CONTACT_366055] (oral).  Some drugs may be given using a needle inserted just 
under the skin (subcutaneous). Other drugs may be given using a needle inserted into a vein (IV 
or intravenous). 
 
The drugs for the study are given in this way: 
MAP 
Week  Day Drug  Method  
12, 17  1,2 
1,2 Doxorubicin * 
Cisplatin  Given as a continuous infusion through a vein 
over 48 hours

  Page 127  
Central Line  
For drugs to be given by [CONTACT_59570], your study doctor will likely recommend that you (your child) have 
a central venous line placed. A central line is a type of tubing inserted into a large vein in the 
chest by a surgeon during a short operation. The central line is used to administer 
chemotherapy drugs and to withdraw small amounts of blood for testing during treatment. How 
the tubing is inserted and all the risks associated with central lines will be explained to you, and 
all of your questions about the central line will be answered, when you sign a separate consent 
for the central line. 
 
 
How long will I be in the study? 
 
We think you will be treated for about [ADDRESS_457707] 
side effects from the treatment that are too bad. 
 
 
Can I stop being in the study?  
 
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101409]. He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  
 
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_366005]. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking 
about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
 
What risks or side effects can I expect from being in the study?  
 
While on this study you are at risk for the side effects listed in Appendix I for MAP therapy as 
you were in Part 1 of the study. You should discuss these with the researcher and/or your 
regular doctor.  
 
If you are randomized to get ifosfamide and etoposide, there may also be other side effects that 
we cannot predict when MAP therapy is used together with ifosfamide and etoposide.  Adding 
ifosfamide and etoposide to MAP therapy will cause additional side effects and prolong the 
length of treatment and may not improve the chance that the disease will go away.  You will be 
watched closely and the ifosfamide and etoposide will be stopped if bad side effects develop.

  Page 130 Reproductive Risks 
For Women : 
The treatment on this study can affect an unborn child .  You should not become pregnant 
or breast feed your baby [CONTACT_238088].  If you are sexually active and are at 
risk of getting pregnant, you and your male partner(s) must use an effective method to avoid 
pregnancy or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about acceptable 
methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will have to use the 
chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the whole time you 
are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even after you finish 
the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to avoid 
pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be permissible 
means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation.  If you have questions about this or 
want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your doctor.  If you 
become pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor and your regular doctor 
immediately. 
 
If you are nursing a baby, the drugs used in this research could pass into the breast milk. You 
should not nurse your baby [CONTACT_238089]. You may 
need to continue this for a while, even after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your 
doctors about the length of time you need to avoid nursing. 
 
For Men : 
The treatment on this study can damage sperm .  You should not father a child while on this 
study as the treatment may indirectly affect an unborn child.  If you are sexually active and are 
at risk of causing a pregnancy, you and your female partner(s) must use a method to avoid 
pregnancy that works well or you must not have sex.  The study doctor will talk to you about the 
acceptable methods to avoid pregnancy while you are being treated on this study.  You will 
have to use the chosen method to avoid pregnancy or abstain (not have sexual intercourse) the 
whole time you are being treated on this study. You may need to continue this for a while, even 
after you finish the cancer treatment, so talk to your doctors about the length of time you need to 
avoid pregnancy or abstain. Natural family planning and the rhythm method will not be 
permissible means of avoiding pregnancy during study participation. If you have questions 
about this or want to change your method to avoid pregnancy during therapy, please ask your 
doctor.  If your partner becomes pregnant during the research study, please tell the study doctor 
and your regular doctor immediately. 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in this study? 
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. While doctors hope that 
adding ifosfamide and etoposide to MAP will be more useful against cancer compared to the 
usual treatment, there is no proof of this yet. We do know that the information from this study 
will help doctors learn more about  osteosarcoma. This information could help future cancer 
patients. 
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? 
 
Instead of being on this study, you have these options: 
 
 The standard treatment for osteosarcoma which is chemotherapy with doxorubicin, 
cisplatin and methotrexate (MAP) without being on this study. 
 Another experimental treatment (if available) 
 
   AOST0331 
  Page 131 Please discuss these options with your regular doctor as well as other trusted personal and 
family advisors.  
 
Will my medical information be kept private?  
 
Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential. We cannot guarantee 
absolute confidentiality. Your personal information may be disclosed if required by [CONTACT_2371].

Certificate protects against the involuntary release of information about subjects 
collected during the course of our covered studies.  The researchers involved in the

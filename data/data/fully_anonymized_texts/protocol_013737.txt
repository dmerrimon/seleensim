FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 12 of 74 Exploratory Efficacy 
Objectives:  • To evaluate the effect of FG -3019 on FVC (liters) 
• To evaluate the effect of FG-3019 on a panel of serum and 
plasma biomarkers 
• To evaluate the relationship between known chromosomal loci 
associated with IPF and the response to FG-3019 
Study Design:  This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study. Subjects who have failed or are intolerant of products approved for treating IPF are eligible. Other subjects must be fully informed of the potential benefits of approved products and make an informed decision that they prefer to participate in a clinical trial in which they may be randomized to placebo. 
Randomized Treatment Period  
Subjects who sign informed consent will undergo screening visits to determine their eligibility . Eligible subjects who provide written 
informed consent will be stratified based on prior therapy with 
nintedanib and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735] (yes/no) and randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment arms: 
 Arm A: FG -3019, 30 mg /kg  
 Arm B: Matching placebo  
Treatment should begin within [ADDRESS_868064] screening visit. 
Study Drug ( FG-3019 [30 mg/kg] or placebo ) will be administered 
by [CONTACT_33433] [ADDRESS_868065] treatment assignment will be unblinded only to designated personnel not associated with the study at FibroGen Inc.  
Extended Treatment Period 
Subjects Enrolled under the Original Protocol and Assigned to Arm A: FG -3019 
All subjects in Arm A whose FVC percent predicted value shows less than 3% a bsolute decrease from baseline in the Randomized 
Treatment Period  will be offered participation in an E xtended 
Treatment Period . These subjects may continue treatment until FVC 
percent predicted decreases 3% or more on two consecutive scheduled evaluations compared to the original pre- treatment 
baseline.  
 
Subjects Enrolled Under Amendment 1 or Subsequent Amendments 
and Assigned to Arm  A: FG -3019

Treatment Period and may continue treatment until FVC percent 
predicted is equal to or less than the pre- treatment baseline on two 
consecutive scheduled evaluations.  
 Subjects Enrolled Under the Original Protocol,  Amendment 1 or Subsequent Amendments Assigned to Arm B: Placebo All subjects assigned to Place bo (Arm B) will be offered 
participation in the Extended Treatment Phase for [ADDRESS_868066] that the baseline for these patient s is the time at which they are 
enrolled into the extension phase (Baseline for Placebo subjects is Week 48 value). Change in FVC percent predicted during the extended treatment phase will be compared to this new baseline. Those subjects whose FVC percent predicted value at Week 48 of the Extension Period  is  greater than the new baseline may continue 
treatment with FG -3019 until FVC percent predicted is equal to or 
less than the  baseline on two consecutive scheduled evaluations. See Section  4.2.3
 for details regarding the Extended Treatment 
Period.

Statistical Methods:  This study is planned to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_868077] -line therapy 
and approximately 26 subjects who failed pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib treatment. First line therapy is defined as no prior therapy with pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib or <10% relative decrease in FVC % predicted while receiving either pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib failure  is defined as having ≥10% 
relative  decrease in FVC % predicted during prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_648054]/or nintedanib treatment. The effect of first -line treatment is the 
primary interest of the study and is the basis for sample size estimates . Assuming a 10% dropout rate and a common standard 
deviation of 7.3, a sample size of 55 subjects per arm in the primary analysis population provides approximately 80% power to detect a treatment difference of 4.[ADDRESS_868078] in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib treatment failure group is similar to that in the general population, the two subgroups will be combined t o achieve 
higher power. 
The primary efficacy analysis is to compare the treatment arms in 
change from baseline to Week  48 in FVC % predicted. A rank 
ANCOVA model will be used. A repeated measures model utilizing all observed data will be used for sensitivity analyses. Logistic regression and Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare categorical endpoints. The Cox regression model will be used in time-to-event endpoints. All efficacy and safety data will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_2939].  
FG-[ADDRESS_868079] either 
completed the Week  48 assessments or discontinued the study. 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  and the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s) , including the archiving of essential documents.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fatal lung disease of unknown 
etiology characterized by [CONTACT_648088]  (Gross, 2001, Raghu, 2011). IPF is the 
most common of seven recognized types of idiopathic int erstitial pneumonia  (Kim, 2006, 
Travis,  2013) .  
The pathogenesis of IPF has not been clearly defined. The long-held view that fibrosis in IPF is 
triggered by [CONTACT_533391] (alveolitis) has given way to the current belief that IPF is a 
disorder caused by [CONTACT_357420][INVESTIGATOR_196648]  (Selman, 2001, Selman, 2006, Wilson, 2009) . 
According to this hypothesis, alveolar cell injury and  activation initiate a dysregulated, 
exaggerated fibrotic healing process characterized by [CONTACT_648089]  (ECM) in genetically susceptible individuals (Agostini, 2006, 
Gross, 2001, Selman, 2004, Selman, 2006, Willis, 2006). Extracellular matrix deposition  and 
other pathologic processes in IPF, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_648055], angiogenesis, smooth muscle cell proliferation, infiltration of mononuclear cells, accumulation 
of loose connective tissue, and cyst formation, eventually remodel  the norm al lung architecture 
and impair the lung’s ability to perform gas exchange.  
Exogenous and endogenous insults to the alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_648056] e fibrotic process  in IPF , but conclusive associations have not been established . The 
most commonly cited exogenous triggers of alveolar injury are exposure to cigarette smoke (Baumgartner, 1997, Flaherty, 2004)  and environmental and occupational dusts (Hubbard, 2001, 
Taskar, 2006), viral infection  (Kelly, 2002, Tang, 2003), and gastroesophageal 
reflux (Raghu, 2006a ). Alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_648057]-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_118854] (Barbas -Filho, 2001, Li, 2004, Selman, 2001, Selman, 2006), resistance of 
myofibroblasts to apoptosis (Thannickal, 2006), oxidant stress (Beeh, 2002, Cantin, 1987, Daniil,  2008, Hunninghake, 2005, Waghray, 2005 ), activation of the coagulation cascade 
(Chambers, 2008, Selman, 2001), and circulating bone marrow- derived fibroblast precursors  
(fibrocytes)  (Andersson-Sjoland, 2008, Hashimoto, 2004) have also been implicated  in the 
pathogenesis of IPF. Genetic factors may play a role, as gene mutations account for some cases 
of familial IPF  (Lawson, 2006), including mutations in the gene encoding surfactant protein C 
and telomerase genes tha t are responsible for telomere length shortening (Armanios, 2007, 
Loyd, 2008, Tsakiri, 2007).  
Transforming growth factor- beta (TGF -β) is a key cytokine thought to drive the fibrotic  process  
in IPF  (Agostini, 2006, Bergeron, 2003 ). Other cytokines , including connective tissue growth 
factor ( CTGF ), platelet -derived growth factor ( PDGF ), tumor necrosis factor -alpha ( TNF -α), 
endothelin-1, interleukin ( IL)-1β, IL-4, IL -10, IL -13, IL-17, osteopontin, matrix 
metalloproteases, and multiple chemokines have been implicated in this complex process  of 
cellular interactions among activated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] , myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, 
endothelial cells, and lymphocytes ( Agostini, 2006, Ask, 2006, Pardo, 2006, Selman, 2004, 
Selman, 2006, Strieter, 2007, Wilson, 2009). The role s of epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) and circulating fibrocytes and other extrapulmonary fibroblast progenitor cells in 
expanding the myofibroblast population within the lung are gaining increased attention 
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 20 of 74 (Lama,  2006, Strieter, 2009, Willis, 2006). Connective tissue growth factor has been shown to be 
a central mediator of tissue remodeling and fibrosis and has been reported to be a downstream 
mediator that is essential for the fibrotic activity of TGF - β (Blom, 2002, Grotendorst, 1997). 
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_648058] . Retrospective data from a large health care 
claims database suggest that the prevalence of IPF ranges from 14.0 to 42.7 per 100,000 and the annual incidence ranges from 6.8 to 16.3 per 100,000, depending on the strictness of the diagnostic criteria employed  (Raghu, 2006b). Among persons aged [ADDRESS_868080] been diagnosed with IPF, and as many as 34,000 are newly diagnosed each year ( Raghu, 2006b). A recent report of a population-based study of adults 
with IPF in Olmstead County, Minnesota, from 1997 to 2005, revealed a prevalence of IPF of 27.9 to 63 cases per 100,000, and an incidence of 8.8 to 17.4 cases per 100,000, again depending on the diagnostic criteria ( Fernandez Perez, 2010) . The prevalence of IPF increases with age, and 
most IPF patients are age 6 0 or older at the time of diagnosis . The disease is more common in 
men than in wo men (Fernandez Perez, 2010 ). Most patients are current or former smokers . 
A familial form of IPF  may account for as many as 20% of cases of IPF (Loyd, 2008).  
Patients with IPF suffer from progressive dyspnea and cough, and most have been symptomatic for several years by [CONTACT_648090] . Delayed diagnosis is therefore common. 
Physical examination often reveals bibasilar inspi[INVESTIGATOR_274341], but it may be normal. Digital clubbing is observed in about one quarter of IPF patients ( King, Jr., 2001). The chest radiograph 
reveals non -specific bilateral, reticular infiltrates in the periphery of the lower  lung zones, often 
with findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary function test s demonstrate 
reduced lung volumes, proportionate reduction in the pulmonary diffusing capacity, and a normal to increased forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second ( FEV
1/FVC ratio ) (Martinez, 2006). Arterial 
hypoxemia, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and an inc reased alveolar -arterial oxygen  gradient that 
worsens with exercise are typi[INVESTIGATOR_648059]  (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: 
diagnosis and treatment. International consensus statement. American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ERS), 2000, King, Jr., 2001). High resolution computed tomography ( HRCT ) scans display subpleural reticular abnormalities and honeycombing, 
especially in the lung bases ( Kim, 2006). Traction  bronchiectasis is a common finding. The 
presence of extensive ground glass opacities, peribronchial and perivascular predominance of infiltrates, discrete lung cysts, small nodules, air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], mosaic attenuation, and consolidation suggest alternative diagnoses  (Misumi, 2006). The sensitivity and specificity of HRCT for the 
diagnosis of IPF in the hands of expert radiologists approach  90% and 80%, respectively 
(Kim,  2006, Raghu, 1999). 
Acute exacerbations of IPF , characterized by [CONTACT_648091], new 
diffuse lung infiltrates and ground-glass opacities on HRCT, and worsening hypoxemia in the absence of pulmonary infection or other identifiable causes, punctuate the natural course of the disease, especially in its pre -terminal phase  (Collard, 2007, Hyzy, 2007, Kim, 2006, Walter, 
2006). These exacerbations  are often fatal events  (Hyzy, 2007, Kim, 2006, Martinez, 2005) . The 
etiology of acute exacerbations of IPF is u nknown, and its pathogenesis is not well understood 
(Collard, 2007). IPF-related exacerbations occurred at a rate of 0.[ADDRESS_868081] udy reported above ( Fernandez Perez, 2010 ). A less 
common, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_648060], which is common in actively smoking males, has been described  (Selman,  2007 ).  
FG-[ADDRESS_868082] demonstrates definite features of “ usual interstitial 
pneumonia” (UIP) (subpleural, reticular infiltrates with basal predominance, honeycombing, and absence of the features suggesting a different diagnosis) in the appropriate clinical setting  
(Raghu, 2011). Surgical lung biopsy, long considered the gold standard for diagnosis of IPF , is 
now performed in a minority of cases because of the morbidity associated with the procedure and increasing acceptance of diagnosis by [CONTACT_206374] ( Raghu, 1999). Nevertheless, combined clinical, 
radiologic, and pathologic correlation  is recommended as the optimal approach  to diagnosis.  
The histopathologic pattern of UIP is a heterogeneous, patchy involvement of lung parenchyma with areas of relatively normal lung tissue adjacent to areas that display architectural distortion  
(“spatial heterogeneity”) , infiltrates of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, collagen deposition, 
honeycombing, Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, smooth muscle hyperplasia, and buds of young prolife rating fibroblasts adjacent to alveoli called “fibroblastic  foci” (Raghu, 2011, 
Selman,  2006, Visscher, 2006). These histopathologic features are more commonly found in 
subpleural regions in the lower lung zones. Interstitial infiltrates of lymphocytes and plasma cells 
are usually not prominent ( Visscher, 2006). 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_648061]. In addition to these drugs, IPF patients are usually managed with supportive measures su ch as symptomatic 
treatment of cough and dyspnea, supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, and pro phylaxis and control of respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014]  (Idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis: diagnosis and treatment. International consensus statement. American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the  European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] (ERS), 2000, Walter, 2006, 
Wuyts, 2009). Corticosteroids and the immunosuppressive drugs cyclophosphamide and azathioprine were commonly prescribed for IPF in the past, but there is no evidence that these drugs improve patient outcomes or alter the natural course of the disease (Collard, 2004, Walter, 2006). Furthermore, IPF subjects taking a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and 
N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) in one arm of a three- arm multicenter Phase 3 clin ical trial experienced 
increased risks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648062] ( Raghu, 2012). A recent multicenter Phase 3 randomized trial of warfar in in patients with 
progressive IPF was stopped because of increased mortality in subjects taking warfarin comp ared 
with those taking placebo ( Noth, 2012). Lung transplantation is the only treatment that improves 
survival ( Noth, 2007, Walter, 2006), but most IPF patients are not eligible for transplantation 
because of their age or comorbid conditions. 
The natural course of IPF is variable. Patients with IPF typi[INVESTIGATOR_648063], but some experience rapid declines and f requent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581794]  (Martinez, 2005). In two Phase 3 clinical trials 
examining the safet y and efficacy of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16330], the mean decline in 
percent predicted FVC from baseline to 72  weeks  was 12.4% in one group receiving placebo and 
9.6% in the other placebo group ( Karimi-Shah, B., 2010). As the interstitial fibrosis and 
architectural  distortion advance in IPF , the lung becomes more noncompliant, and the work of 
breathing and dyspnea increase. Progressive pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale often characterize the late course of the disease. The median survival is about 7 years after the onset of 
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 22 of 74 symptoms and 3 years after the initial clinic visit ( King, Jr., 2001). In patients over the age of 70, 
the median survival is about 15 months after the initial clinic visit ( King, Jr., 2001). 
The 5 -year survival rate of patients with IPF is approximately 20%  to 40% ( Kim, 2006), which is 
worse than that of all major cancers except cancer of the lung, pancreas, and esophagus 
(Siegel,  2012). Mortality from IPF was reported to have increased 28% in men and 41% in 
women between 1992 and 2003 (Olson, 2007). The majority of IPF patients die from complications of the disease, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], pulmonary hypertension, and pneumonia, or from coronary artery disease ( Daniels, 2008, Gross, 2001, Martinez, 2005, 
Olson, 2007). The high mortality rate of IPF and the modest e fficacy of approved drugs to treat 
IPF underscore the need to explore new pharmacologic approaches to manage this devastating disease.  
1.2 Connective Tissue Growth Factor  
Connective t issue growth f actor is a 3 8 kDa secreted matricellular glycoprotein of the 
cysteine- rich 61/CTGF/nephroblastoma overexpression ( CCN ) family  (Perbal, 2004, 
Rachfal,  2005). It is produced by [CONTACT_648092], including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial 
cells, mesangial cells, and stellate cells .  
The name “connective tissue growth factor” implies a mechanism of action akin to that of classical growth factors , which signal through specific cell- surface receptors . However, 
experimental evidence does not support this concept . Instead , CTGF and the other members of 
the CCN  family have activities associated with matricellular proteins that function in a more 
subtle modulatory fashion. Matricellular proteins, with prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_648064] ( SPARC ), osteopontin, and thrombospondins, are a 
subclass of ECM proteins that modulate cellular functions and signaling pathways through 
multiple mechanisms depending on cell type and the cellular context  (Bornstein, 2002). These 
proteins are gener ally expressed at high levels during development and in response to injury; 
they typi[INVESTIGATOR_648065]-surface receptors, ECM components, growth factors, and cytokines. Connective tissue growth factor fits squarely within this definition ( Chen, 2009). The 
cellular functions that can be modulated by [CONTACT_494542]/or organization of ECM, cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration and EMT. Modulation of cellular signaling appears to occur through interactions of CTGF with 1) cell surface components such as integrins or the low density lipoprotein receptor- related protein ( LRP)-1 (a multifunctional endocytic and 
signaling receptor), 2) cytokines and cytokine inhibitors, and 3) matrix components such as heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and fibronectin. Interactions with HSPGs may displace 
other HSPG-binding proteins such as VEGF and bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs). It is 
believed that binding of cytokines to CTGF may either sequester  them in an inactive 
conformation, or help  to present cytokine binding partners to their receptors. 
Connective tissue growth factor is  a central mediator of tissue remodeling and fibrosis 
(Lipson, 2012) . Connective tissue growth factor is essential for the fibrotic activity of TGF -β 
(Mori, 1999, Wang, 2011 ) but it may also act independently of TGF- β. While much has been 
made of the role of TGF- β in fibrosis, studies of the role of fibronectin in pulmonary fibrosis 
showed that the activity of TGF- β is dependent on cellular  fibronectin to induce myofibroblast 
differentiation and that cellular fibronectin may have a fundamental role in activation of latent TGF -β (Muro, 2008). Shi-w en and colleagues  showed t hat critical activities of TGF -β in the 
fibrotic process are dependent on CTGF expression, including EMT and ECM deposition, 
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 23 of 74 supporting the idea that CTGF over- expression is critical for activities attributed to TGF -β 
(Shi-wen, 2006). 
Connective tissue growth factor has been shown to be an important mediator of pulmonary 
fibrosis in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis ( Bonniaud, 2004). Lasky 
and coworkers observed upregulation of CTGF messen ger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA) gene 
expression in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting a possibl e 
role of CTGF in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis ( Lasky, 1998). 
1.3 Connective Tissue Growth Factor in  Idiopathic Pulmonary F ibrosis  
Transcripts of genes for TGF -β1 and CTGF were reported to be approximately 7-fold and 4-fold 
higher, respectively, in transbronchial lung biopsy specimens of patients with IPF compared with 
normal ( Ziesche, 1999). TGF -β is expressed at fibrogenic foci in IPF  (Broekelmann, 1991). 
Increased CTGF gene expression has been described in transbronchial biopsy specimens and in 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with IPF ( Allen, 1999, Pan, 2001). Allen and coworkers 
also reported that CTGF mRNA expression is increased 10-fold in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
in patients with IPF, compared with healthy control subjects ( Allen, 1999) . Connective tissue 
growth factor in plasma was reported to be elevated in IPF patients and the abundance correlated with change in FVC ( Kono, 2011). These observations suggest that CTGF may have a role in the 
pathogenesis of IPF. 
1.[ADDRESS_868083] FG -3019    
FG-3019 is a fully human, recombinant DNA-derived, IgG
1 kappa monoclonal antibody that 
binds to CTGF in the N-terminal domain 2, with high affinity (K d = 0.1–0.2 nM). The antibody, 
which has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa and contains 1326 amino acids, has 
been shown to interfere with the  activity of CTGF . For additional information on FG -3019, 
please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure.   
1.5 Clinical Trial Experience with FG -3019 
The clinical trial experience with FG -3019 includes seven clinical studies that are described in 
the Investigator’s Brochure (Version 13, 18 December 2014). Overall safety experience with FG-[ADDRESS_868084] received multiple doses of blinded study drug (FG-3019 or placebo) in the current trial Overall, FG-3019 has been well tolerated. 
Adverse events  (AEs ) have been generally mild or moderate in severity and transient in duration. 
The AEs have been typi[INVESTIGATOR_648066]’ underlying medical condition(s) and, in placebo-controlled studies, were equally distributed between the placebo and FG -[ADDRESS_868085] a potential 
role for FG-3019 in interfering with the activity of CTGF and thereby [CONTACT_648093]. Connective tissue growth factor is conside red a potential target for 
therapeutic intervention in pulmonary fibrosis ( Antoniou, 2007, Ask, 2006, Blom, 2002, 
Bonniaud, 2004, Grotendorst, 1997).  
A murine model of chronic lung fibrosis demonstrated that FG -3019 attenuated 
radiation -induced lung remodeling ( Huber, 2010) . In mice treated with FG -[ADDRESS_868086] groups that 
received FG -3019. Mice that received FG -3019 starting 3 weeks  after irradiation had a survival 
rate of 70% at the end of the study (48  weeks  after irradiation) compared with 0% survival in the 
irradiated controls  (Huber, 2010). In another study, administration of FG -3019 to mice with 
bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis significantly inhibited lung hydroxyproline content, a marker of lung collagen content  (FibroGen , 2003, data on file ). 
These preclinical findings ar e supported by p reliminary efficacy data in the FGCL -3019-[ADDRESS_868087] that treatment of subjects with IPF with FG -3019 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg 
IV every 3  weeks  is associated with improvement or stability in quantified scores of whole lung 
fibros is in approximately 45 percent of subjects at 24  weeks  (Raghu, 2012 ). Changes from 
baseline in these scores were significantly correlated with changes in FVC percent of predicted value ( Raghu, 2012). In 2012, the FDA granted  Orphan Drug Designation to FG -3019 for the 
treatment of IPF. A randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial of FG-3019 30 mg /kg is 
warranted at this time to further assess safety , tolerability, and efficacy in subject s with IPF .

4.2.4 End of Treatment and Follow -up 
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomized Treatment Phase 
• Subjects assigned to either FG-3019 or placebo who discontinue treatment before week 
48 should undergo end of treatment and safe ty assessment visits ( Appendix 3). 
• Subjects who were assigned to FG-3019 complete 48 weeks of treatment and  are not 
going on to the Extended Treatment Period should undergo a Safety Assessment visit 
(Appendix 3); Week 48 evaluation is identical to End of Treatment visit. Thus, subjects 
who complete Week 48 and are not eligible for the extension study only need the final safety assessment. Subjects who enter  the Extended Treatment Period  do not need a final 
safety assessment because they are continuing treatment).

4.2.[ADDRESS_868096] of treatment with FG-3019 on the endpoints described in 
Section  3, approximately 50% of subjects will be randomized to placebo treatment (A rm B). 
The placebo control is appropriate for this trial given the population of participating subjects. 
Enrolled subj ects are those who have failed or are intolerant of approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648067]. For these subjects the only treatment option is best supportive care, which is available to them within this protocol, and optionally exper imental 
treatment. Therefore, placebo control, which provides for the best supportive care, is appropriate and ethical. Additionally, subjects who are randomized to placebo will be offered crossover treatment to the active arm after completion of the initial 48 -week treatment period.  
4.3 Treatment Assignment  
Subjects are stratified by [CONTACT_648098][INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib (yes/no) and randomized 1:1 to FG-3019 or placebo using an  Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).

Subjects will receive FG-3019 at a dose of 30 mg /kg by [CONTACT_648100]   (unless 
volume is >250mL in which case the study drug can be administered undiluted)  every 3 weeks . 
The maximum dose of FG -3019 at any infusion will be capped at 3,900 mg.  
4.6 Concomitant Medications , Procedures  and Nondrug  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
4.6.1 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications (any prescription and/or over-the-counter [OTC] preparation) and 
procedures or nondrug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., physical therapy, acupuncture, continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]) used by a subject while participating in this clinical trial must be recorded from S creening Visit 1 through the End-of-Study (EOS) V isit.  
Other than the restrictions  that follow, concomitant medications may be given at the discretion of 
the Investigator. It is expected that Investigators will provide optimal medical management of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and that subjects may be treated with concomitant medications for their various medical conditions . Optimal medical care must be provided, and Investigator s 
should ensure , for example, that subjects maintain stable vital signs  and laboratory test values 
during the course of the study. 
Oral p rednisone or equivalent oral corticosteroid (up to 10 mg  daily) and NAC  (up to 1800 mg  
daily) will be allowed during the study. Prohibited medications include approved or investigational agents for the treatment of interstitial 
lung diseases including IPF. The list of prohibited concomitant medications for treatment of IPF includes, but is not limited to, the following: sildenafil,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735], nintedanib, azathioprine, 
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, interferon gamma 1b, D penicillamine, methotrexate, leflunomide, colchicine, bosentan, ambrisentan, aminobenzoate, mycophenolate mofetil, imatinib, relaxin, etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, anakinra, abatacept, and rituximab. If sildenafil is used for erectile dysfunction the dosage regimen should be no more than three times a week. Immunosuppressives and monoclonal antibodies used for other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are allowed but the indication should be clearly documented. Indications for concomitant medications should be clearly documented in the subjects clinical record (use for IPF or other diseases). 
Any medications to treat IPF should be terminated within [ADDRESS_868099] 4 weeks before Day 1 dosing (Exclusion criterion 15). 
Questions about concomitant medications should be addressed to the attention of the FibroGen 
Medical Monitor or des ignee.

complete and focused physical examinations, laboratory tests, and PFT s will be performed at 
frequent intervals  as described in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2. Any medically significant 
changes from baseline will be monitored throughout the study and appropriate interventions will be taken accordingly. Safety and tolerability will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_2918].  
4.8 Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
4.8.1 Safety Monitoring 
Safety data in this double-blind placebo-control led study will be monitored on a regular basis by 
a Data Monitoring Committee  (DMC) that is independent of the FibroGen Medical Monitor and

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 38 of 74 7 STUDY PROCEDURES -ALL COHORTS UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED  
7.1 Study Procedures  
The study procedures and assessments are presented for the Randomized Treatment phase in  
Appendix 1, for the Extended Treatment phase in Appendix 2, and for End -of-Treatment and 
Follow-up periods in  Appendix 3. See the Study Reference Manual for add itional details.  
The treatment  period in the Randomized Treatment Phase begins on Day 1 (first infusion  of 
Study D rug) and continues through Week  48. Visit windows are within ± [ADDRESS_868116] eligibility for the Extended Treatment  Phase and to arrange scheduling of the Day 1- EX Visit . 
The total interval between the Week  45 Visit in the Randomized Treatment Phase and the Day 
1-EX Visit in the Extended Treatment Phase should not exceed 6 weeks . If necessary, an 
unscheduled visit should be performed to obtain repeat pulmonary function tests (FVC) if the  
interval between the Week  45 Visit in the Randomized Treatment Phase and the Day 1- EX Visit 
in the Extended Treatment Phase is expected to exceed 6 weeks .  
The treatment period  in the Extended Treatment Phase begins on Day 1- EX (first infusion of 
FG-3019) and continues until progression or withdrawal. Visit windows are within ±  [ADDRESS_868117]  
The key study procedures that measure efficacy are serial PFT measurements to look at 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (see Procedure Manual for PT F for additional details) and serial HRCT assessments 
to look for fibrosis (see Site Manual for HRCT and Appendix 5).  
7.3 Blood Volume 
The total amount of blood taken is  approximately 13 tablespoons (195 ml) in the Randomized 
Treatment Phase and 10 tablespoons (150 ml) per year in the Extended Treatment Phase (total 23 tablespoons (345ml) for two years. Subjects who continue Extended Treatment beyond one year will give approximately 150 mL of blood per year.  
7.4 Missed Visits 
Every attempt should be made to complete all study visits within window as outlined in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and  Appendix 3).  
Scheduled visit dates are determined from the time of the first dose, which is defined as Day 1. Protocol-defined visits conducted outside the ± 3 day study visit window will be recorded a s a 
protocol deviation unless there is an AE/SAE/intercurrent illness. If a dose is delayed due to an AE/SAE/illness, the next dose should occur as soon as possible when the patient is stable so that 
FG-[ADDRESS_868118]’s  clinical record.  
For missed visits without an AE/SAE/intercurrent illness, the subject will be asked to resume the planned visit schedule and return for the next scheduled visit. If the subject is unable to perform PFTs at a scheduled visit the PFT can be performed at the next scheduled visit. 
Refer to the case report form ( CRF ) completion guidelines in the Study Reference Manual for 
additional information on CRF completion requirements for missed visits.  7.5 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled Visit assessments may be required at the dis cretion of the Investigator. These 
should be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Subjects who, in the judgment of the PFT technician or investigator, are unable to perform PFTs 
adequately on a scheduled visit should undergo PFT assessment at the next scheduled visit or sooner if feasible. 
7.6 Assessments 
7.6.1 Central Laboratory 
All laboratory tests of blood and/or urine specimens will be performed by a central laboratory or 
FibroGen, as appropriate . A Central Laboratory Manual with instructions on specimen 
collection, processing, storing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_167398].  
7.6.2 Local Laboratory(s)  
A local laboratory will analyze  urine (and blood, if necessary) samples for pregnancy testing 
only. 
7.6.3 Other Reference Laboratories  
Human anti-human antibody plasma  level  measurement will be performed at a specialty 
laboratory. 7.6.4 Exploratory Biom arkers  
Serum  and plasma  samples  will be stored and used to explore additional biomarkers of 
FG-3019’s effects . The final selection of these biomarkers will be made  by [CONTACT_2918], based 
upon the best scientific data available at that time.  
7.6.5 DNA for Genomic A nalysis 
Fingerlin et al performed  a genome-wide association study in subjects with fibrotic idiopathic 
interstitial pneumonias (N  = 1616) and controls (N = 4683) ( Fingerlin, 2013) and determined an 
association of disease with TERT and MUC5B on chromosomes 5p15 and 11p15, respectively, 
the chromosome 3q26 region near TERC, and identified 7 novel chromosome loci. The novel loci include FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9 (19p13), 
FG-[ADDRESS_868119] DISCONTINUAT ION  
Subjects who discontinue the study early should be strongly encouraged to complete the 
End-of-Treatment and Follow -up V isit (Appendix 3).   
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, whether during the Screening, Treatment, or Follow-up Periods. Co mpletion of efficacy assessments as outlined in Appendix [ADDRESS_868120] fro m study treatment is based on the judgment of the Investigator in consultation with the 
FibroGen Medical Monitor. 
• Pregnancy in a female subject  
• AEs, SAEs, repeated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or medical conditions that make further participation in the study a risk to the subject.  
• Clear evidence of progression of IPF and or absolute decline in FVC % of predicted value of ≥10%   in the absence of an intercurrent illness, documented by [CONTACT_648103][INVESTIGATOR_75037].  
• Receipt of a prohibited medication that cannot be discontinued. 
Dosing may be temporarily suspended up to 4 weeks for:  
• Acute exacerbation of IPF , defined as (1) worsening or newly developed dyspnea as 
reported by [CONTACT_423] (≤30 days); (2) new bilateral ground-glass opacities on HRCT superimposed on the UIP abnormalities that defined subject eligibility for the study (Section  5.1); and (3) worsening hypoxemia (in the judgment of the Investigator), in the 
absence of pulmonary infection, heart failure, or other identifiable causes for this  finding. 
• Any other intercurrent illness that temporarily precludes the subject receiving the study drug infusion. 
The reason s for suspension of treatment should be clearly documented in the subject’s clinical 
record.  
8.1 Replacement of Subjects   
At the Sponsor’s discretion, the number of subjects who are enrolled may be increased to account for early dropouts if the dropout rate is projected to be greater than 10%.  
FG-[ADDRESS_868121] -line therapy and 26 subjects who failed pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/ or 
nintedanib treatment . First -line therapy is defined as no prior therapy with pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib 
or <10% relative decr ease in FVC % predicted while receiving either pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]. 
Failure of pi[INVESTIGATOR_648068] ≥ 10% relative decrease in 
FVC % predicted during prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib treatment. The effect of first -line treatment 
is the primary interest of the study, and is the basis for sample size determination . Assuming a 
10% dropout rate and a common standard deviation of 7.3, a sample size of 55 subjects per arm 
in the primary analysis population provides approxi mately 80% power to detect a treatment 
difference of 4.[ADDRESS_868122] at the two -sided significance level of 0.05. The expected treatment difference 
is estimated using data from stud y FG -3019-049 and placebo data from published studies. In 
Study FG-3019-049, a mean decline of 2.8 in % predicted FVC from baseline to Week 48 was observed. The expected decline of 7.0 % predicted FVC in the placebo arm is estimated based on the weighted average of published studies ( Azuma, 2005, Daniels, 2010, Demedts, 2005, King, 
Jr., 2008, King, Jr., 2009, King, Jr., 2011, Meier-Kriesche, 2004, Noble, 2011, Noth, 2012, Raghu, 2004, Raghu, 2008, Raghu, 2012, Richeldi, 2011, Taniguchi, 2010, Zisman, 2010).  
Second line therapy patients are evaluated in an exploratory fashion. If the treatment effect in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]/nintedanib failure group is similar to that in the general population, the two 
subgroups will be combined to achieve higher power.

medication. If actual treatment received differs from the randomized treatment arm, the actual treatment arm will be used for safety data analysis.  
10.2.2 Full Analysis S et Population 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population  will consist of randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of study drug and have evaluable FVC assessments at  baseline and at least one 
evaluable post baseline. The FAS population will be used in the primary analyses of the PFT endpoints and other efficacy endpoints except for PFS. 
10.2.[ADDRESS_868124] Evaluable (HE) Population will consist of randomized subjects who have evaluable 
HRCT fibrosis scores at baseline and at Week  [ADDRESS_868125] visit in  the 
Extended Treatment Phase. 
Baseline characteristics, safety, and biomarker data will be summarized based on available data 
in the Safety Population, except for the parame ters indicated otherwise.  The primary efficacy 
analyses will be based on the FAS population, except for the analysis of PFS, which will be based on the Safety Population. All safety, efficacy, and exploratory endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_648104].  
All randomized subjects will be included in the data listings.  
Continuous variables will be presented by [CONTACT_9086]: n, mean, standard deviation, or standard error, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will  be presented by

10.3.4 Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy analyses will be performed in subjects in the FAS population except for analyses of PFS , which will be based on the Safety Population. Rules of missing data imputation 
will be described in the SAP. Analyses based on observed data will be used for sensitivity analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary analysis will be to compare the treatment arms in change from baseline to Week 48 in FVC % predicted  based on the FAS Population. A rank ANCOVA model will be used, with  
baseline FVC % predicted value as covariate, treatment group, stratification, and treatment by [CONTACT_648105]. Factors may be eliminated from the model if the y are 
insignificant. If the interaction term is significant, the primary analysis will be based on the subgroup of subjects on first-line therapy.  
The ranks of the primary endpoint will be based on observed data and on imputed data if 
observed data are no t available. A detailed description of the rank assessment will be described 
in the statistical analysis plan. A repeated measures model utilizing all observed data will be used for sensitivity analysis.

[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Progression Free Survival 
PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of the following e vents 
during the study (whichever occurs first): 
1. Death from any cause  
2. Absolute decline FVC percent of predicted value of ≥10% not due to intercurrent illness 
confirmed by [CONTACT_161966][INVESTIGATOR_648069] 
3.  Clinical diagnosis of progression of IPF 
The analysis of PFS will be based on the Safety Population. If no PFS event is observed during the study, the n PFS is censored at the last  PFT assessment.  
Comparison between treatment arms in PFS will be performed using the Cox regression model with adjustment for baseline FVC % predicted value as well as stratification and stratification by [CONTACT_9866].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of IPF DNA Markers  
Exploratory analyses will be performed to evaluate the relationship between clinical response to FG-3019 and variants in the chromosomal loci listed in Section 7.6.5 
10.3.5 Safety Analyses 
Treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) , defined as new or worsening AEs that occur after 
the first dose of study drug and within [ADDRESS_868127] either completed Week  48 assessments or discontinued the 
study early (prior to week 48 of the Randomized Treatment Phase). This analysis may be performed before data lock for the primary analysis of safety and efficacy provided the relevant pulmonary function and pulmonary fibrosis data are cleaned. If there is a substantial gap in 
completion of enrollment between subjects on first-line therapy and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_648070], unblinded subgroup analysis may be performed at different times.

below in accordance with the FDA Final Rule Vol 75, No 188, September 29, 2010, and/or Article 18 of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 and the I nternational Conference on Harmo nisation (ICH) E2A guidance.  
11.2 Definition s 
11.2.1 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal and clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off- label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE includes medical conditions, signs, and symptoms not previously observed in the subject 
that emerge during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with an underlying condition that were not present prior to the AE reporting period (Section 11.3.1).  
11.2.2 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event  is any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in any of 
the following outcomes: 
• Death,  
• A life -threatening AEs  (i.e., if in the view of the investigator or sponsor, the subject was 
at immediate risk of death at the time of the event) . Life -threatening does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe, 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110256],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect, or 
• Other medically important events  
FG-[ADDRESS_868129] be reported to the sponsor similar to SAE s. 
• A clinical diagnosis of IPF progression and surgical procedures such as lung transplantation  are expected in this patient population. Data for IPF progression is being 
collected an efficacy endpoint (Sections 3.2.2, [IP_ADDRESS]). However, as these events are 
medically significant and may be associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], so they should be reported as SAEs.   
• Other elective surgeries (example  knee replacement, haemorroidectomy, mole removal 
etc.) may occur during the study period. They should not be reported as SAEs, but the diagnosis that warranted  these procedures should be reported ( especially if this is a 
worsening of a pre-existing medical history condition). A ny complications of such 
procedures should be reported as AE/SAE based on seriousness criteria listed above. 
11.2.3 Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
drug caused the AE. The term “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reacti on implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about causality than the term “adverse reaction”.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_868130]  (“Special Situations”) on the medici nal products administered to the 
subject as part of the study (e.g., study drug, comparator, and background therapy) that may 
require expedited reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to: 
• Overdose of the medicinal product 
• Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product 
• Medication error involving the medicinal product (with or without subject exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]) 
• Drug -drug interaction  
11.[ADDRESS_868131] dose of study drug, except for pregnancy 
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 74 reporting ( Section 11.3.6 ). In addition, all AEs reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_648106], outside the study period, may be recorded. 
Adverse events  will be followed until resolved, stable, or until the subject’s last study visit or lost 
to follow-up. If an AE is not reso lved or stabilized at the subject’s last visit, it is up to the 
discretion of the Investigator and study Medical Monitor  to determine if further monitoring of 
the event is warranted . 
Adverse events collected prior to dosing of study drug will be considered “non- treatment 
emergent” while those reported after the first dose of study drug and up to [ADDRESS_868132] 
dose of study drug will be considered “treatment emergent” and will be assessed  for relationship 
to study drug. 11.3.2 Adverse Event  Eliciting/Reporting  
During the AE reporting period, study site personnel will query each subject at each visit to 
actively solicit any AE occurring since the previous visit. All AEs will be collected in response to a general question about the subject’s we ll-being and any possible changes from the baseline 
or previous visit, but shall not be specifically solicited. There will be no directed questioning for any specific AE. This does not preclude the site from collecting and recording any AEs reported by [CONTACT_167439].  
Whenever possible, diagnoses should be recorded when signs and symptoms are due to a 
common etiology, as determined by [CONTACT_167440]. New indications for medications started after informed consent is obtained until [ADDRESS_868133] dose of study 
drug will be recorded as AEs; recurrence or worsening of medical history problems requiring new or changes in concomitant medication,  will also be recorded as AEs. Abnormal, clinically 
significant laboratory results, physical examination findings, and ECGs will be recorded as AEs if they are deemed by [CONTACT_167441] . 
The following attributes must be assigned to each AE: 
• Description (Investigator’s verbatim term describing the event)  
• Dates of onset and resolution 
• Severity  
• Relationship to study drug  
• Outcome 
• Action taken regarding study drug 
• Other treatment required  
• Determination of “seriousness”  
11.3.3 Assessing Adverse Event Severity  
Adverse E vents, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, should be graded using the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) guidelines (Version 4.03; http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf ). For terms not specified as part of NCI CTCAE, the following 
guidelines should be used to determine grade: 
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 50 of 74 All AEs will be assessed for severity using the following criteria:   
• Grade 1, Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms which the subject finds easily 
tolerated . The event is of little concern to the subject and/or of little-or- no clinical 
significance; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2, Moderate: The subject has enough discomfort to cause interference with or 
change in some of their age-approp riate instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money); local or noninvasive intervention indicated. 
• Grade 3, Severe: The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in many or all usual activities . The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses 
substantial risk to the subject’s health or well-being; Likely to require medical intervention and/or close follow-up, including but not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]. 
• Grade 4, Life- threatening:  The subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  
• Grade 5, Death:  Death related to AE.  
11.3.4 Assessing the Adverse Event’s Relationship to Study Drug  
Most of the information about the safety of a drug prior to marketing comes from clinical trials; therefore, AE reports from investigators are critically important. Moreover, appropriately deciding whether the AE meets the definition of a suspected adverse reaction is usually the most 
difficult determination, but it is critical to avoid the miscategorization of the product’s safety profile.  
Due to the historical tendency for assessment of relationship to default as possibly related, the FDA has issued new guidance that clarifies the intent of the phrase “reasonable possibility” in the definition of “associated with the use of the drug.”  Default reporting of individual events as 
possibly related is uninformative and does not meaningfully contribute to the development of the 
product safety profile.  
The Investigator must provide an assessment of the relationship of the AE to study drug in 
accordance with the guidance below. Absence of an alternative cause would not normally be considered enough evidence to assess an event as possibly related or related to study drug.  
• Related (Adverse Reaction):  
o Any event for which there is evidence to conclude that the study drug caused the event  
• Possibly Related (Suspected Adverse Reaction):  
o A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure, such as angioedema, anaphylaxis, rhabdomyolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, etc. 
o One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug, such as tendon rupture 
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 51 of 74 • Not Related:  
o The event represents the underlying disease (e.g., disease-related symptoms, 
disease progression) 
o The event represents a comorbid condition present at the time the subject entered 
the study that has not worsened 
o The event represents a known adverse reaction associated with a co -medication 
received by [CONTACT_1177] 
o The event is common for the study population (e.g., cardiovascular events in an elderly population) 
The I nvestigator must provide an assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug, as 
this information is very important to monitor the real-time safety of the study drug. However, as the manufacturer of the study drug, Beijing FibroGen is responsible for making the final causality assessment for individual reports, and for reporting suspected adverse reactions and adverse reactions to Health Authorities. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_868134] be reported immediately to the Sponsor and/or its designated safety management 
vendor. 
To report an SAE,  the Investigator must fax an SAE  Report Form to the Sponsor’s designated 
safety management vendor  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the serious event . In case of 
emergency or doubt, the Investigator shall call the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor for guidance. 
Follow-up reports must be submitted in a timely fashion as additional information becomes available.  
Full details of the SAE should also be recorded on the medical records and in the CRF. The 
following minimum information is required: 
• Subject number, sex, and age 
• The date of report 
• A description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event) 
• Causal relationship to th e study drug 
Follow-up information for the event should be sent promptly (within 7 days) as necessary. 
For each SAE observed, the Investigator should obtain all of the information available about the 
event, including (but not limited to): hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167401], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167402], death certificate, appropriate laboratory findings (including autopsies and biopsy results), and clinical examinations (including radiological examinations and clinical consultations). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board/ Independent 
Ethics Committee  
The Investigator is responsible for notifying his/her Institutional Review Board/Independent 
Ethics Committee ( IRB/I EC) of SAEs in acco rdance with local regulations. Sponsor, or its safety 
representative, will provide to the Investigator a copy of any expedited safety reports that it 
intends to file with a regulatory authority.  
FG-3019  Protocol FGCL -3019 -067 Amendment 5.1  
FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 52 of 74 [IP_ADDRESS] Deaths  
For any death or life -threatening event occurring during the subject’s study participation 
regardless of attribution, the Investigator will report the death or life -threatening event 
immediately to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. The Investigator must provide an assessment of 
the relationship of the event to the study drug according to the guida nce in Section  11.3.4. 
The I nvestigator should notify FibroGen of any death or other SAEs occurring after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
If the death occurred within the SAE collection and reporting period (signed ICF to [ADDRESS_868135] dose), the Investigator must submit the SAE Report Form in the same manner as described above in Secti on 11.3.5. Additionally, the site must complete the appropriate CRF page. This 
includes death attributed to progression of the subject’s underlying disease.  
11.3.6 Pregnancies: Reporting and Follow-u p of Subjects  
A pregnancy in a female subject must be confirmed by a positive serum β -HCG test . If a female 
subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving study treatment  or within [ADDRESS_868136] be completed and submitted to 
the Sponsor (by [CONTACT_167442]) within [ADDRESS_868137] follow the pregnancy to 
completion to ascertain both its outcome (e.g., spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) and whether any AEs occur.  
Pregnancy itself is not an AE. However, the I nvestigator should report the information to the 
Sponsor on the designated forms. Pregnancies are followed up to outcome even if the subject 
was discontinued from the study. The outcome of the pregnancy must be reported by [CONTACT_167443] a Pregnancy Outcome Report Form, which should be sent to the Sponsor and/or its designated safety management vendor within [ADDRESS_868138]’s partners is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies should if possible be followed up and documented as described. To capture information about a pregnancy from the partner of a ma le subject, the male subject’s partner 
consent must be obtained to collect information related to the pregnancy and outcome (will be handled on a case-by- case basis with IRB/I EC approval).  
11.3.[ADDRESS_868139] review and assess all laboratory results in a timely manner, and determine whether the abnormal laboratory values, if any, are clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS), and whether there are associated signs and symptoms. Clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities will be reported as AEs.  
An abnormal laboratory finding in absence of any other signs or symptoms is not necessarily an AE. If the abnormal laboratory finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_142312], report the signs and symptoms as the AE in lieu of the abnormal laboratory value. If a diagnosis is available, report the diagnosis. 
FG-[ADDRESS_868140] a 
meaningful change from the screening value(s) and that require active management are to be considered by [CONTACT_167444] (e.g., abnormalities that require study treatment dose modification, discontinuation, more frequent follow- up assessments, etc. ).  
FG-[ADDRESS_868141] a combined 
pre-qualification site visit and site initiation visit. Following site pre-qualification and/or 
initiation of the study site, periodic monitoring visits and site closeout visits will be made by 
[CONTACT_167445] . The Investigator must provide direct access to, and allocate sufficient 
space and time for , the monitor to inspect subject source records, CRF s, queries , collection of 
local laboratory normal ranges (if applicable) , investigational product accountability records, and 
regulatory documents in accordance with GCP and the ICH E6 guideline. 
The purpose of trial monitoring is  to verify the following: 
• The rights and well-being of human subjects are protected. 
• The reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
• All data are collected, tracked , and submitted by [CONTACT_648107], 
including unscheduled and missed assessments. 
The Investigator must also permit the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities to inspect 
facilities and records pertaining to this study if so requested. If the Investigator is notified of an 
inspection pertaining to this study by [CONTACT_167447], the 
Investigator must notify FibroGen immediately.  
12.1 Data Quality Assurance 
The following steps will be taken to ensure that the study is conducted by [CONTACT_351020], GCP, and other applicable regulatory requirements :  
• Investigator meeting and/or Investigator site initiation  
• Routine study site monitoring 
• Documented study and system training 
• CRF  and query review against source documents 
• Collectio n of local laboratory normal ranges 
The study site may be audited by [CONTACT_2918]’s  Quality Assurance department or designee. The 
Investigator agrees to make available to the auditor all necessary study personnel (including himself/herself ), all source documentation, and study subject records related to this trial. The 
Investigator agrees to follow-up to address and/or correct any audit observations promptly. 
12.[ADDRESS_868142] data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_648108]/or designee. Data that appear inconsi stent, 
incomplete or inaccurate will be queried for site clarification.  
Adverse events  and concomitant medications will be coded using industry standard dictionaries 
(e.g., Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [ MedDRA ] and  World Health Organizatio n 
Drug ( WHODrug ) dictionaries).  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all subject data, i.e. , 
CRFs and queries prior to study completion. 
FG-[ADDRESS_868143] 
This protocol, the Informed Consent Form, the Investigator’s Brochure, and any information to 
be given to the subject (e.g., subject information sheet, questionnaires) must be submitted to a 
properly constituted IRB by [CONTACT_648109]. In 
addition, any subject recruitment materials must be approved by [CONTACT_648110].  
The Investigator is respo nsible for obtaining reapproval by [CONTACT_648111]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_5699]’s annual report and other required report to the IRB and copi[INVESTIGATOR_648071]. A copy of the signed form FDA [ADDRESS_868144] also accompany the above approval letter provided to FibroGen. 
Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB of any protocol changes or 
amendments , changes to the Investigator’s Brochure, and other safety-related communications 
from FibroGen . Investigators also are responsible for promptly informing the IRB of protocol 
deviations/violations, as required by [CONTACT_11577]. Written documentation of IRB approval must be received before the amendment is implemented.  
Investigators must also enter the names of the staff that are involved in the study on the Delegation of the Authority form and sign the form (including their responsibilities). This form must be updated when responsibilities of the staff change. 
13.3 Informed Consent Form  
No study procedure may be implemented prior to obtaining a signed  and dated written Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) from the subject or the subjects legally authorized representative. IRB 
review and approval are required for the ICF . The final IRB -approved ICF must be provided to 
FibroGen for regulatory purposes.  
If there are any changes to the Sample ICF during the subjects’ participation in the study, the 
revised I CF must receive the IRB’s written approval before use and subjects must be 
re-consented to the revised  version of the ICF.

FibroGen, Inc.  Confidential and Proprietary  Page 73 of 74 Appendix 5. Radiation Risk Assessment  
The estimated radiation dose that results from participation in this study is based on an estimate 
is for a “standard patient” such as the MIRD phantom used in the ImPACT dose calculator spreadsheet. However, the ImPACT spreadsheet does not have a model for all CT platforms and for these the DLP*k method is used. For this method we assume a “standard sized” patient model, scan length is 25 cm (the length of the lungs for the MIRD Phantom) and a k factor of 0.014 mSv/mGy*cm for a thoracic scan (AAPM report 96 and European Guidelines 2000). For this study the expected doses are summarized in the table below. 
Please NOTE that for each visit, one CT exam will be performed. That exam will consist of a 
required TLC scan. RV scans are not required for the quantitat ive image analysis data being 
collected for this study. Effective dose estimates provided: (For this study, visits occur at Baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 18 months and 2 years (i.e. 5 studies).

 Title: Treatment of unfavorable bleeding patterns in contraceptive implant users: a randomized 1 clinical trial of curcumin 2  3 PI: [INVESTIGATOR_668619], MD, MPH 4 Oregon Health & Science University 5 3181 SW Sam Jackson, UHN 50 6 Portland, OR [ZIP_CODE] 7 [PHONE_14902] 8 [EMAIL_13705] 9  10 Co-I: Jeffrey Jensen, MD, MPH 11 Marci Messerle Forbes, FNP 12 Andrea O’Donnell, FNP 13  14 Funder: Investigator initiated 15  16 Background: 17 The etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal contraceptive implant (ENG implant) is a highly effective 18 method of preventing pregnancy, but it has bleeding side effects that make it unappealing for 19 many women. Given that the ENG implant is 20 times more effective at pregnancy prevention 20 than oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], strategies to increase its acceptability will translate into improved 21 prevention of unplanned pregnancies [1].  Many medications have been studied with progestin-22 only contraceptives such as the ENG implant to manage irregular bleeding.  Concurrent use of 23 oral contraceptives (OCs) with the implant does stop bleeding but bleeding returns when OCs 24 are stopped [2, 3]. The only study to demonstrate a sustained reduction in bleeding lasting for 25 two months was the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen in users of the 26 levonogestrel (LNG) contraceptive implant [4].  We conducted a small clinical trial to evaluate 27 the effects of a 7-day course of tamoxifen in users of Nexplanon© with bothersome 28 breakthrough bleeding, and demonstrated that tamoxifen treatment reduces bleeding/spotting [ADDRESS_975604] 30 days after use as compared to placebo [5]. Recently, we successfully 30 completed a study that expanded on our original tamoxifen work and found similar results over a 31 90-day time period ([COMPANY_006] IIS, paper under development).  [ADDRESS_975605] concerns about this particular drug since it is used for 35 cancer.  Tamoxifen also has a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with [ADDRESS_975606] a risk of VTE but the concern is still 38 present as well as the stigma that it is a ‘cancer’ drug. If another agent without these concerns [ADDRESS_975607] mechanism of progestin-induced bleeding is unknown but it is likely multi-factorial 43 with the end result of angiogenesis, ‘leaky’ fragile vasculature, and inflammation. Curcumin, the 44 active ingredient in turmeric, has been demonstrated to be anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, 45 and anti-angiogenic which may make it an ideal agent for the management of break-through 46 bleeding. The FDA has determined curcumin is safe and categorizes it as ‘generally regarded 47 as safe’ (GRAS).  Studies have demonstrated that curcumin is extremely well-tolerated. [ADDRESS_975608] treatment in patients with cancer, 49 cardiovascular disease and auto-immune/inflammatory conditions. In terms of women’s health, 50 curcumin was better than placebo in a randomized control trial in attenuating the severity of 51

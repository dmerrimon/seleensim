Protocol Template, Version 3.0   PRÉCIS Intervention Structure, Implementation Protocol, Fidelity/Adherence Monitoring Plan:  In this study, we will refine and pi[INVESTIGATOR_572394] 4 primary care clinics by: (a) leveraging existing clinic staff to deliver DICE to care partner-PLWD dyads; (b) using electronic resources to identify and recruit PLWD-care partner dyads based on clinically relevant and minimum inclusion/exclusion criteria; and c) evaluating clinically relevant outcomes using the electronic medical record (EMR).  DICE will be implemented in four large primary care clinics within the UCD Health System over a 6-month period (n=100 PLWD-care partner dyads; 25 dyads per site, allowing comparison of implementation and outcomes by [CONTACT_572414]). Key “study champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]” at each of the four primary care clinics will be the licensed practical nurse assigned to each clinic who will serve as the Onsite DICE Coordinator (ODC).   As a minimal risk study embedded in primary care practices, we plan to obtain a waiver of informed consent for PLWD, care partners and clinic staff in order to reduce introduction of artificial care resources or biases wherever possible. Additionally, a HIPAA waiver will be obtained for subject identification (see a. below) and outcome ascertainment from the EMR. There will be minimal PHI data collected. At the time the agreement is finalized, the IRB of Record to make the HIPAA determinations, or if necessary UC Davis IRB will make the HIPAA determinations before releasing the acknowledgment of a reliance on an external IRB.   We have arranged with University of [LOCATION_004] Davis LVN supervisors ([CONTACT_572439] and [CONTACT_572440]) to do a 6-hour training for all of the LVNs on a single day. This will be a hybrid of in person (kick off session and ending brainstorming session) and watching the online modules together in a campus auditorium. ODCs will then use the approach in a “test” case in study months 2-3 during which they will engage in as needed coaching with a DICE trainer (a geriatric psychiatrist and education specialist) to ensure they are using the approach with fidelity.  The DICE trainer will also be available as needed for coaching during the remainder of the study for approach related questions. Manualization and training with follow-up coaching have been shown to be effective implementation strategies that can enhance fidelity of implementation of an evidence-based program.  Other clinic personnel (social workers and PCPs) will also receive the manual, an email overview of the study, and be invited to train using the website or at the on-site training. Following training and case consultation, the ODCs will then use the DICE Approach for any PLWD they encounter during the 6-month study period (months 4-9). Primary outcome metrics will be collected using the electronic medical record and by [CONTACT_572415].   The ODC will meet with the PLWD-Care partner dyad by [CONTACT_572416]. If no BPSD are currently present, the ODC will educate the care partner about DICE, including minimizing risk factors to prevent behaviors, and plan to continue monitoring (26) for BPSD during the 6-month study period. If BPSD are occurring, then the “Describe” and “Investigate” Steps of DICE will be triggered.  Each step of DICE will be documented by [CONTACT_572417]. In the “Describe” step, the ODC will obtain an accurate characterization of the behavior and the 
Protocol Template, Version 3.[ADDRESS_751584] troublesome behavior (as defined by [CONTACT_572418]) using the one-item question we have used in prior trainings (16, 17): “Please rate from 0 to 4 the severity and frequency of the behavior (0=none or never; 1=mild and/or occasionally; 2=moderate and/or sometimes; 3=severe and/or frequently; and 4=very severe and/or daily). If the severity and frequency are different, pi[INVESTIGATOR_572395] (e.g. a behavior that is daily but mild should be scored as a 4)”. In the “Investigate” step, the ODC will identify possible underlying and modifiable causes of the behavior.  With information obtained in the “Describe” and “Investigate” steps, the ODC will work with the care partner to create and implement a treatment plan to manage BPSD. The ODC will brainstorm with the care partner (e.g. what are activities the PLWD enjoys) and instruct the care partner in behavioral and environmental strategies. These approaches could include enhancing effective communication with the PLWD, creating meaningful activities, dealing with environmental challenges including ensuring safety, and simplifying tasks and creating structured routines. The ODC will also consult with other relevant clinic personnel on the Create treatment plan as needed; for example, a plan may involve having the provider assess and manage infection, constipation or pain. From prior experience with DICE, these first three steps (Describe, Investigate, Create) can be accomplished in 30 minutes.  Following the “Create” step, and in a 2-week follow-up contact [CONTACT_107461], the ODC will engage in the “Evaluate” step with the care partner, during which the ODC will determine if recommended strategies were used and their effectiveness. Effectiveness will be measured by [CONTACT_572419]/severity question asked of the care partner in Describe so that the impact of the strategy can be assessed quantitatively comparing the pre- and post-strategy scores at 2 weeks’ time; any downward movement of the score will be categorized as effective. , If the DICE generated strategies were effective, the ODC will monitor and surveil for BPSD with monthly contact. If the DICE generated strategies were not effective, the ODC will problem-solve with the care partner and other team members to determine if a) strategies were used and if so correctly; or b) if strategies are not effective and additional “Create” recommendations are needed. Additionally, the DICE trainer (MB) will be available to ODC for coaching regarding the DICE Approach as needed during the study period.   Study Title  Training Dementia Care Professionals to Help Care Partners Improve the Management of BPSD Using the DICE Approach Objectives  Primary: To pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a clinical implementation of The DICE Approach to not only provide clinicians tools to address behavioral issues with PLWD patients via their caregivers but also to determine the feasibility of ascertaining and analyzing the primary (psychotropic medication use) and secondary clinical outcomes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement of PLWDs), including whether they differ for participants of color.  
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 ii Secondary: To inform the design of a future large-scale ePCT, including its relevance to people from diverse racial, ethnic, socio-economic, and educational backgrounds who are living with dementia and their care partners. DICE is centered around reducing the “knee-jerk” use of psychiatric medications for sedation among PLWD, particularly when the underlying causes of BPSD (e.g. infection; pain; stressful environment) have not been explored.  Design and Outcomes   In this study, we will refine and pi[INVESTIGATOR_572394] 4 primary care clinics by: (a) leveraging existing clinic staff to deliver DICE to care partner-PLWD dyads; (b) using electronic resources to identify and recruit PLWD-care partner dyads based on clinically relevant and minimum inclusion/exclusion criteria; and c) evaluating clinically relevant outcomes using the electronic medical record (EMR). DICE will be implemented in four large primary care clinics within the UCD Health System over a 6-month period (n=100 PLWD-care partner dyads; 25 dyads per site, allowing comparison of implementation and outcomes by [CONTACT_572414]). Key “study champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]” at each of the four primary care clinics will be the licensed practical nurse (LVN) assigned to each clinic who will serve as the Onsite DICE Coordinator (ODC).   Aim 1:  Feasibility measures will include: 1) rate of enrollment of PLWD-care partner dyads; 2) number of contacts between ODCs and dyads; and 3) time requirements for ODCs implementing DICE (as estimated by [CONTACT_572420]).    Acceptability will be measured by [CONTACT_572421]’s recommendations of strategies for BPSD (generated by [CONTACT_572422]) among dyads, as well as by [CONTACT_572423]. Exit interviews of participants (ODCs, other providers and care partners) will be conducted to further deepen the knowledge of intervention acceptability and implementation challenges.  Clinical outcomes: all UCD clinical sites (inpatient and outpatient) use the same EMR (EPIC), so ascertaining clinical outcomes will be uniform across clinics. The primary clinical outcome is the feasibility of measuring psychotropic medication use. Mean PLWD participant psychotropic medication use during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate of medication use among PLWD for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention).   Aim 2: Secondary clinical outcomes will be the feasibility of measuring rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement ascertained from the EMR. Mean PLWD participant health care utilization during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate in the 6 months prior to the intervention). The feasibility of obtaining the nursing home placement variable from the EMR will be established during this pi[INVESTIGATOR_572396].   
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 iii Interventions and Duration  The DICE Approach intervention will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_210412] 6 months during the study period. As above, mean PLWD participant psychotropic medication use during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate of medication use among PLWD for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention). Secondary clinical outcomes(Aim 2) will be the feasibility of measuring rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement ascertained from the EMR. Mean PLWD participant health care utilization during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate in the 6 months prior to the intervention). Sample Size and Population  Study aim 1: We will examine data across 4 clinics to assess the feasibility of a multi-site study. We selected 25 dyads per clinic as our sample size (total n=100) to have the ability to examine feasibility measures within clinic as well as across clinic with some accuracy. For example, the degree of accuracy around an enrollment rate of 75% overall is 18% (width of the 95% confidence interval), allowing us a tighter margin of error overall. Within clinic, accuracy is larger (width of 95% confidence interval 36%), suggesting more uncertainty, but allowing us to examine clinic-specific enrollment to ensure that there is consistency across clinics.  An exploratory analysis will the subjects enrolled in the study (n= 100 PLWD) as described above, will be compared on [measures] with historical controls (n=100 PLWD) .

DICE will be implemented in four large primary care clinics within the UCD Health System over a 6-month period (n=100 PLWD-care partner dyads; 25 dyads per site, allowing comparison of implementation and outcomes by [CONTACT_572414]). Feasibility measures will include: 1) rate of subject enrollment (PLWD-care partner dyads); 2) number of contacts between ODCs and dyads; and 3) time requirements for ODCs implementing DICE.  Acceptability will be measured by [CONTACT_572421]’s recommendations of strategies for BPSD (generated by [CONTACT_572422]) among dyads, as well as other providers within the primary care practice. Exit interviews of participants (ODCs, other providers and care partners) will be conducted to further deepen the knowledge of intervention acceptability and implementation challenges. Secondary Objectives: To determine the feasibility of ascertaining and analyzing the primary (psychotropic medication use) and secondary clinical outcomes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement of PLWDs) from the existing health system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) which will subsequently be used in a full-scale 
Protocol Template, Version 3.[ADDRESS_751589]. Clinical outcomes for PLWD participants will be measured after the 6-month DICE implementation period using the EMR and compared to corresponding outcomes for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention (“historical control”; all PLWD in the four participating clinics): 2a) To determine the feasibility of measuring psychotropic medication use (primary outcome) within the EMR. Mean participant psychotropic medication use during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate of medication use for participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention). 2b) To determine the feasibility of measuring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement (secondary outcomes) using the EMR. Mean participant health care utilization during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate in the 6 months prior to the intervention).  2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus Managing behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) is one of the most challenging aspects of caring for a person living with dementia (PLWD), causing intense care partner (family and formal provider) burden and upset, and posing threats to their health and well-being. Importantly, PLWD with BPSD are at risk for increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285], emergency department (ED) visits and nursing home placement. Potentially preventable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (PPH) encompasses hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572398], with optimal access to outpatient care and management, should be unnecessary (e.g. urinary tract infection). Notably, dementia has been associated with the greatest additional PPH risk in patients with less medical comorbidity, belying the notion that patients with dementia are at increased risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572399]. A key factor in increased PPH risk is thought to be the presence of BPSD. The potential influence of BPSD on healthcare outcomes is conceptually depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1, which suggests that modifiable patient, environmental and care partner factors impact this relationship/ PWLD typi[INVESTIGATOR_572400]. However, Primary Care Physicians (PCP’s) largely lack the time, training, and access to dementia care expertise and delivery care systems to effectively manage the nearly ubiquitous BPSD. Although the FDA has not approved any medications to treat BPSD, it is common clinical practice to use psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics to try to control them. However, antipsychotics show only limited efficacy in improving behavioral symptoms and have significant risks including side effects and mortality resulting in FDA black box warnings regarding their use for this purpose. Moreover, care partners frequently manage multiple BPSD simultaneously, and that can be a “moving target”—aggression may co-occur with or be replaced with wandering, and so on. Thus, the very nature of BPSD makes a simple “magic bullet” medication solution impossible, ineffective and inappropriate. 
Protocol Template, Version 3.[ADDRESS_751590], pragmatic, patient-centric, evidence-informed algorithm approach (“DICE”), to manage BPSD. DICE protocolizes an approach that has been tested in various randomized trials. The DICE Approach systematically guides care partners and clinicians alike through the assessment and management of BPSD and teaches new transferrable problem-solving skills (Figure 2).  We have manualized and developed both in-person and online care partner module-driven training in DICE. The trainings have now been delivered to hundreds of care partners nationally (Michigan, [LOCATION_004], North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin) and internationally ([LOCATION_006]) where they have shown positive impact (18,19). The manual (20) has sold over 500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_572401] 2017 and the training website released in 2020 (21) has over 500 subscribers.  The training approach was created with an eye towards wide-spread implementation and dissemination. The goal was to create a short training (6 hours, as opposed to weeks or months in other trainings) to minimize the time spent learning the approach. Given that prior studies have shown that brief mental health training programs can be effective for producing new skills in both professional providers (22) and family care partners (23), we created a training program aimed broadly at anyone (provider, family or professional care partner) caring for PLWD. 

Protocol Template, Version 3.0 6  The training uses a modular format comprised of 8 sections:  1. What is dementia? 2. Behaviors in dementia 3. Describe step (learning to create a complete symptom description to guide assessment and management of behaviors) 4. Investigate step (identifying, examining and ruling out possible underlying and modifiable causes of behavior) 5. Create step (learning how to use behavioral and environmental strategies to manage behavioral symptoms; strategies based upon those nonpharmacologic approaches with the strongest evidence base, family caregiver interventions, which include caregiver education and support, training in stress reduction/cognitive reframing and specific skills in problem solving) 6. Evaluate step (assessing whether recommended strategies were or were not effective) 7. Learning about medications 8. Caring for the caregiver The companion manual follows the modular format of the trainings. Training has been designed to be interactive, incorporating videos and hands-on learning and systematically moves trainees through a problem-solving approach to identify appropriate and tailored strategies to address the presenting BPSD (18). DICE has been designed to be algorithmic, easy to remember and helpful to create good habits and problem-solving. Strategies generated are based on patient and care partner profiles and the environmental context of behavioral occurrences. The approach includes guidance on the most judicious and appropriate use of psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_572402], and expands the discussion of medications beyond psychotropi[INVESTIGATOR_572403], Version 3.0 7 of BPSD (e.g. pain, infection, constipation). Thus, in the approach, pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic strategies or their combination may be recommended (1). Given that in-person trainings are both time and personnel intensive, we subsequently used the lessons learned from the in-person trainings to create a training website that is accessible 24/7 while retaining the interactive format (via e-simulations of various clinical situations both to teach the approach and test knowledge following training). The DICE approach is ready for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_572404]: it is manualized; there is a brief, tested, and accessible training program; it is designed for use by [CONTACT_572426]; and its outcomes (mitigating negative effects of BPSD) reflect what matters to all stakeholders, including reduced inappropriate medication use.  Figure 2 describes the DICE Approach in more detail.  3 STUDY DESIGN There are no public-facing marketing materials for this study.  In this study, we will refine and pi[INVESTIGATOR_572394] 4 primary care clinics by: (a) leveraging existing clinic staff to deliver DICE to care partner-PLWD dyads; (b) using electronic resources to identify and recruit PLWD-care partner dyads based on clinically relevant and minimum inclusion/exclusion criteria; and c) evaluating clinically relevant outcomes using the electronic medical record (EMR). DICE will be implemented in four large primary care clinics within the UCD Health System over a 6-month period (n=100 PLWD, care partner n= 100) dyads; 25 dyads per site, allowing comparison of implementation and outcomes by [CONTACT_572414]). Key “study champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]” at each of the four primary care clinics will be licensed practical nurse assigned to each clinic who will serve as the Onsite DICE Coordinator (ODC).  Secondary outcomes: EMR data collection: To determine the feasibility of ascertaining and analyzing the primary (psychotropic medication use) and secondary clinical outcomes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement of PLWDs) from the existing health system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) which will subsequently be used in a full-scale effectiveness ePCT. Clinical outcomes for PLWD participants will be measured after the 6-month DICE implementation period using the EMR and compared to corresponding outcomes for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention (“historical control” n=100; compared to the sample of PLWD n=100. The total study sample size N= 100.  As a minimal risk study embedded in primary care practices, we plan to obtain a waiver of informed consent for PLWD, care partners and clinic staff in order to reduce introduction of artificial care resources or biases wherever possible. Additionally, a HIPAA waiver will be obtained for subject identification (see a. below) and outcome ascertainment from the EMR. There will be minimal PHI data collected. We will work with each clinic site to allow ODC’s the dedicated time (at least 6 hours) to engage in the online training during month one of the study. Because we want to have the least impact 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 8 on clinic schedules, ODCs will be permitted to do the training at their own pace asynchronously (e.g. all ODCs need not do the training at the same time). ODCs will then use the approach in a “test” case in study months 2-3 during which they will engage in as needed coaching with a DICE trainer (a geriatric psychiatrist and education specialist) to ensure they are using the approach with fidelity.  The DICE trainer will also be available as needed for coaching during the remainder of the study for approach related questions. Manualization and training with follow-up coaching have been shown to be effective implementation strategies that can enhance fidelity of implementation of an evidence-based program.  Other clinic personnel (nurse care navigators and PCPs) will also receive the manual, an email overview of the study, and be invited to train using the website. Following training and case consultation, the ODCs will then use the DICE Approach for any PLWD they encounter during the 6-month study period (months 4-9). Primary outcome metrics will be collected using the electronic medical record and by [CONTACT_572415].  4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  Study Population: English-speaking (as discerned from the EMR) PLWD-Care partner dyads from the [ADDRESS_751591]:  • via warm handoff from a clinic provider to the ODC via the current standard of care for working with caregivers of PLWD regarding behavioral concerns, ODCs will be notified of the potential study participant by [CONTACT_572427]. The ODC will then contact [CONTACT_572428]. We will also track the proportion of PLWD without a caregiver listed for study tracking.  Setting: Participants will be recruited from four primary care clinics in the Primary Care Network (total of 13) at University of [LOCATION_004] Davis. Clinics have been selected for the number of PLWD seen annually in each clinic.

Participants will be recruited from four primary care clinics in the Primary Care Network (total of 13) at University of [LOCATION_004] Davis. Clinics have been selected for the number of PLWD seen annually by [CONTACT_572431]. As a minimal risk study embedded in primary care practices, we plan to obtain a waiver of informed consent for PLWD, care partners and clinic staff in order to reduce introduction of artificial care resources or biases wherever possible. There will be minimal PHI data collected.  [ADDRESS_751594] arranged with University of [LOCATION_004] Davis LVN supervisors to do a 6-hour training for all the LVNs on a single day. This will be a hybrid of in person (kick off session and ending brainstorming session) and watching the online modules together in a campus auditorium. ODCs will then use the approach in a “test” case in study months 2-3 during which they will engage in as needed coaching with a DICE trainer (a 
Protocol Template, Version 3.[ADDRESS_751595]) to ensure they are using the approach with fidelity.  Manualization and training with follow-up coaching have been shown to be effective implementation strategies that can enhance fidelity of implementation of an evidence-based program.  Other clinic personnel (social workers and PCPs) will also receive the manual, an email overview of the study, and be invited to train using the website or at the on-site training. Following training and case consultation, the ODCs will then use the DICE Approach for any PLWD they encounter during the 6-month study period (months 4-9). Primary outcome metrics will be collected using the electronic medical record and by [CONTACT_572415].   As part of the DICE program, the ODC will meet with the PLWD-Care partner dyad by [CONTACT_572416]. If no BPSD are currently present, the ODC will educate the care partner about DICE, including minimizing risk factors to prevent behaviors, and plan to continue monitoring (26) for BPSD during the 6-month study period. If BPSD are occurring, then the “Describe” and “Investigate” Steps of DICE will be triggered.  Each step of DICE will be documented by [CONTACT_572432]. In the “Describe” step, the ODC will obtain an accurate characterization of the behavior and the context in which it occurs as well as quantify the frequency and severity of the most troublesome behavior (as defined by [CONTACT_572418]) using the one-item question we have used in prior trainings (16, 17): “Please rate from 0 to 4 the severity and frequency of the behavior (0=none or never; 1=mild and/or occasionally; 2=moderate and/or sometimes; 3=severe and/or frequently; and 4=very severe and/or daily). If the severity and frequency are different, pi[INVESTIGATOR_572395] (e.g. a behavior that is daily but mild should be scored as a 4)”. In the “Investigate” step, the ODC will identify possible underlying and modifiable causes of the behavior.  With information obtained in the “Describe” and “Investigate” steps, the ODC will work with the care partner to create and implement a treatment plan to manage BPSD. The ODC will brainstorm with the care partner (e.g. what are activities the PLWD enjoys) and instruct the care partner in behavioral and environmental strategies. These approaches could include enhancing effective communication with the PLWD, creating meaningful activities, dealing with environmental challenges including ensuring safety, and simplifying tasks and creating structured routines. The ODC will also consult with other relevant clinic personnel on the Create treatment plan as needed; for example, a plan may involve having the provider assess and manage infection, constipation or pain. From prior experience with DICE, these first three steps (Describe, Investigate, Create) can be accomplished in 30 minutes.  Following the “Create” step, and in a 2-week follow-up contact [CONTACT_107461], the ODC will engage in the “Evaluate” step with the care partner, during which the ODC will determine if recommended strategies were used and their effectiveness. Effectiveness will be measured by [CONTACT_572419]/severity question asked of the care partner in Describe so that the impact of the strategy can be assessed quantitatively comparing the pre- and post-strategy scores at 2 weeks’ time; any downward movement of the score will be categorized as effective.  If the DICE generated strategies were effective, the ODC will monitor and surveil for BPSD with monthly contact. If the DICE generated strategies were not effective, the ODC will 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 11 problem-solve with the care partner and other team members to determine if a) strategies were used and if so correctly; or b) if strategies are not effective and additional “Create” recommendations are needed. Additionally, the DICE trainer (MB) will be available to ODC for coaching regarding the DICE Approach as needed during the study period.  5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  See above. 5.3 Concomitant Interventions  Not applicable. 5.4 Adherence Assessment  Rather than adherence, in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will be examining feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility measures will include: 1) rate of enrollment of PLWD-care partner dyads; 2) number of contacts between ODCs and dyads; and 3) time requirements for ODCs implementing DICE (as estimated by [CONTACT_572420]).   Acceptability will be measured by [CONTACT_572421]’s recommendations of strategies for BPSD (generated by [CONTACT_572422]) among dyads, as well as by [CONTACT_572423].  6 STUDY PROCEDURES

If none are present, the ODC will educate the care partner about BPSD and the DICE Approach and create a plan for monitoring during the 6-month study period. If BPSD are present, the “Describe” and Investigate” steps of the DICE intervention will be triggered. Using this information during the same visit, the ODC will work with the care partner to create and implement a treatment plan. This visit will be accomplished in [ADDRESS_751598] visit. The ODC will engage in the “Evaluate” step to determine if the treatment plan was implemented and its effectiveness. If effective, the ODC will monitor and surveil for BPSD with monthly contact. If not effective, the ODC will work with the care partner to create additional treatment strategies and then follow up at intervals between 2 weeks and 1 month as needed. 6.2.4 Completion/Final Evaluation At the final visit, an evaluation of the current effectiveness of DICE strategies will be performed. Exit interviews of participants (ODCs, other providers and care partners) will be conducted to further deepen the knowledge of intervention acceptability and implementation challenges. We will seek a waiver of informed consent for these interviews which will be conducted by [CONTACT_38991].  7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   The anticipated risks are very minimal given that this is a non-pharmacologic intervention being implemented to enhance usual care. 7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters NA 7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters NA 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 14 7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a clinical research study participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research. Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any adverse event that: • Results in death • Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred • Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects • Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards  No AE’s or SAE’s are expected based upon the study intervention. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572405]. However, we will collect data on such events from the medical chart and caregiver report during visits and report them as needed.   7.4 Reporting Procedures The primary investigator will be responsible for determining the severity and whether any AE or SAE is study related. Severity of Event For adverse events (AEs), the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. These terms should match those collected on the Adverse Event Form.  Relationship To Study Intervention Given the nature of the intervention, a binary assessment (related/not related) will be used. No AE’s or SAE’s are expected based upon the study intervention. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572405]. AEs for this study include:  Mild inconvenience due to the time taken for the intervention.  SAEs for this study include:  Given the nature of the participant population based on age and comorbidities, death can reasonably be expected (unrelated to the intervention) in some PLWD.    
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 15  7.5 Follow-up for Adverse Events The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during visits with the ODC or study team review of the medical record. We will distinguish between alerts and adverse events as developed by [CONTACT_572434]. Alerts refer to events occurring independently of the study and place the PLWD or care partner at risk. These could include a care partner medical emergency, PLWD driving, aggression in the dyad, suicidal ideation in a care partner or PLWD, etc. The Project Manager will keep a running record of alerts and dates of resolution. We will seek resolution of an alert within [ADDRESS_751599]. Kales weekly during research administration meetings. Adverse events include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. ED visit, nursing home placement or death of a caregiver or PLWD. There are two levels of monitoring of adverse events. For AEs attributed to the study/intervention, notification of the PI, IRB, Safety Officer (SO) and NIA occurs within 24 to 48 hours of identification of the event, as per the DSMP and as noted in Section 7.7 below. For AEs not attributed to the study/intervention, the first level of monitoring occurs on a weekly basis and involves the following; a) the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572406]-emergency events at staff meetings with project directors at their respective sites; b) events are reviewed at weekly interviewer meetings at respective sites to assure that each has been managed appropriately and follow-up and resolution obtained); c) all events will be entered in a secure on-line data management system developed, and monitored at DU. The second level of review involves generating aggregate data reports that are provided to both PIs and SO twice yearly for review (or more frequently if they so choose). Data entry and an aggregate review facilitate a double check that events are resolved and assist in monitoring of the trial. Resolution of events is defined as the participant having been contact[CONTACT_572435]. 7.[ADDRESS_751600] Collaboratory Safety Officer (SO) will be appointed to evaluate all study protocols and enrollment rates to ensure conformity to human subject procedures and patient safety in the trial. The SO will also review the study design, the IRB protocols, any adverse events, and interim reports of the ongoing study. [CONTACT_572441] will be responsible for overseeing the preparation of data and data analyses for the SO.  The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a daily basis. In addition, the NIA IMPACT Collaboratory SO will oversee all data and safety monitoring activities for this study. The SO will act in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to monitor participant safety, to evaluate the progress of the study, and to review procedures for maintaining the 
Protocol Template, Version 3.[ADDRESS_751601] the ethical review required for the protection of human subjects.  NIA PO, in consultation with SO, will make a determination regarding how often data safety monitoring reporting is needed.    7.7 Reporting schedule: • All adverse events that are serious (SAE) and unexpected (i.e., have not been previously reported for the study’s intervention) will be reported to the IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader ([CONTACT_286445]), NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory project’s Safety Officer (SO) within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of SAE. o Only those adverse events that are serious (SAE), unexpected, and related to the intervention must also be reported to Advarra IRB. Unexpected and unrelated SAEs will be reported to Advarra IRB on a case-by-case basis if requested by [CONTACT_572436]’s Safety Officer (SO) or NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO.  • All deaths will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader ([CONTACT_286445]), NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory project’s Safety Officer (SO) within 24 hours of study’s knowledge of death. o Advarra IRB does not require the specific reporting of death outside of the SAE reporting requirement above, but they will be notified on a case-by-case basis if requested by [CONTACT_572436]’s Safety Officer (SO) or NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO.  • All unanticipated problems (UPs) will be reported to the IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Leader ([CONTACT_286445]), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory project’s Safety Officer (SO) within 48 hours of the study’s knowledge of the event.  • The summaries of all previously reported unexpected and related SAEs, deaths, and UPs, as well as all other SAEs and AEs will be reported to IMPACT Collaboratory Regulatory and Data Team Lead ([CONTACT_286445]), Advarra IRB, NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO ([CONTACT_572445]), and the IMPACT Collaboratory project’s Safety Officer (SO) at a minimum every [ADDRESS_751602]’s Safety Officer (SO) or NIA IMPACT Collaboratory PO.  
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 17 8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION   As a minimal risk study embedded in primary care practices, we plan to obtain a waiver of informed consent for PLWD, care partners and clinic staff in order to reduce introduction of artificial care resources or biases wherever possible. The DICE Approach will be delivered as part of routine care. It is possible that PLWD/care partners may drop out of routine outpatient care. If this occurs, we will continue to monitor and evaluate PLWD data.  9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  9.0 General Design Issues  The overarching goal of this proposal is to refine and pi[INVESTIGATOR_572407]: (a) leveraging existing clinic staff to deliver DICE; and (b) using electronic resources to identify and recruit PLWD-care partner dyads based on clinically relevant and minimum inclusion/exclusion criteria.  We maximize a pragmatic approach and minimize a separate study infrastructure to evaluate feasibility and acceptability in order to prepare for a larger embedded pragmatic trial (ePCT). Licensed practical nurses embedded in four primary care practices at University of [LOCATION_004] Davis (UCD), whom we will refer to as “Onsite DICE Coordinators” (ODC), will coordinate behavioral management using DICE with care partner-PLWD dyads and other clinic providers. We will accomplish this goal through the following specific aims: Aim 1.  To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the ePCT protocolized version of DICE that will guide the subsequent evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention in a full-scale ePCT. DICE will be implemented in four large primary care clinics within the UCD Health System over a 6-month period (n=100 PLWD-care partner dyads; 25 dyads per site, allowing comparison of implementation and outcomes by [CONTACT_572414]). Feasibility measures will include: 1) rate of subject enrollment (PLWD-care partner dyads); 2) number of contacts between ODCs and dyads; and 3) time requirements for ODCs implementing DICE.  Acceptability will be measured by [CONTACT_572421]’s recommendations of strategies for BPSD (generated by [CONTACT_572422]) among dyads, as well as other providers within the primary care practice. Exit interviews of participants (ODCs, other providers and care partners) will be conducted to further deepen the knowledge of intervention acceptability and implementation challenges. Aim 2. To determine the feasibility of ascertaining and analyzing the primary (psychotropic medication use) and secondary clinical outcomes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement of PLWDs) from the existing health system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) which will subsequently be used in a full-scale effectiveness ePCT. Clinical outcomes for PLWD participants will be measured after the 6-month DICE implementation period using the EMR and 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 18 compared to corresponding outcomes for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention (“historical control”; all PLWD in the four participating clinics): 2a) To determine the feasibility of measuring psychotropic medication use (primary outcome) within the EMR. Mean participant psychotropic medication use during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate of medication use for participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention). 2b) To determine the feasibility of measuring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement (secondary outcomes) using the EMR. Mean participant health care utilization during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate in the 6 months prior to the intervention). 9.1 Sample Size and Randomization We will examine data across 4 clinics in order to assess the feasibility of a multi-site study. We selected 25 dyads per clinic as our sample size (primary study sample- total n=100 PLWD), and their caregiver (n=100) in order to have the ability to examine feasibility measures within clinic as well as across clinic with some accuracy. For example, the degree of accuracy around an enrollment rate of 75% overall is 18% (width of the 95% confidence interval), allowing us a tighter margin of error overall. Within clinic, accuracy is larger (width of 95% confidence interval 36%), suggesting more uncertainty, but allowing us to examine clinic-specific enrollment to ensure that there is consistency across clinics. To determine the feasibility of ascertaining and analyzing the primary (psychotropic medication use) and secondary clinical outcomes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement of PLWDs) from the existing health system-wide electronic medical record (EMR) participants (the primary study sample of PLWD n=100) will be measured after the 6-month DICE implementation period using the EMR and compared to corresponding outcomes for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention (historical controls n=100); all PLWD in the four participating clinics), (N=300).  9.2 Treatment Assignment Procedures  Not applicable 9.3 Interim analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572408] 9.4 Outcomes  Clinical outcomes: all UCD clinical sites (inpatient and outpatient) use the same EMR (EPIC), so ascertaining clinical outcomes will be uniform across clinics. The primary clinical outcome is the feasibility of measuring psychotropic medication use. Mean PLWD participant 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 19 psychotropic medication use during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate of medication use among PLWD for the four participating clinics in the 6 months prior to the intervention). Secondary clinical outcomes will be the feasibility of measuring rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], ED visits and nursing home placement ascertained from the EMR. Mean PLWD participant health care utilization during the intervention period will be compared to historical controls (mean rate in the 6 months prior to the intervention). The feasibility of obtaining the nursing home placement variable from the EMR will be established during this pi[INVESTIGATOR_572396].   9.5 Data Analyses Data will be summarized with descriptive statistics to allow us to review the demographics and clinical characteristics of our enrolled participants, as well as to review implausible values. The extent of missing data will also be assessed as a key indicator of feasibility of collecting data from clinic notes and the EMR; additionally, we will ascertain whether baseline characteristics are associated with missingness in order to modify study procedures for the larger trial. Feasibility will be characterized by [CONTACT_572437] (# enrolled/# invited to enroll), number of contacts between ODCs and dyads (summarized as averages/SDs across dyads), and time requirements (summarized as averages/SDs). We will examine these overall and by [CONTACT_6903], to ensure consistency across clinics. We will summarize data on medication use (binary: psychotropic use or not) for the four clinics overall prior to the study and for enrolled PLWD post-intervention and will compare them using mixed models with a logit link to analyze these pre-post data, accounting for correlation within clinic. Models will first be fitted in a crude fashion, secondarily we will include covariate adjustment as a means to inform design characteristics in the ePCT, recognizing we have limited power to make definitive conclusions from these analyses. We will similarly examine healthcare utilization (counts of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210364]; binary measure of nursing home placement) once we ensure that these data are feasibly collected from the EPIC EHR. Models will first be fitted in a crude fashion, secondarily we will include covariate adjustment to inform design characteristics in the ePCT, recognizing we have limited power to make definitive conclusions from these analyses. We will similarly examine healthcare utilization (counts of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_210364]; binary measure of nursing home placement) once we ensure that these data are feasibly collected from the EPIC EHR. In order to go on to the ePCT, we must meet two criteria. First, the primary feasibility outcome (enrollment rates) must be greater than 75%. Second, we must be able to show that the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval for testing the pre-post medication use is greater than a 25% decrease in the pre-study proportion. The former criteria is based on the observed enrollment rate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_572409] (17) of PLWD-care partner dyads; the latter is based on what is reasonable to assume will change in the shorter 6-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_572410].  
Protocol Template, Version 3.[ADDRESS_751603] (IRB) Review This protocol and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_109753].   11.[ADDRESS_751604] a waiver of informed consent through the use of 
Protocol Template, Version 3.0 21 electronic medical records for historical controls.  We offer the following justifications for the waivers of informed consent: • the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects. This is an augmentation of usual care.  The anticipated risks are minimal given that this is a non-pharmacologic intervention being implemented to enhance usual care by [CONTACT_572438]. The training is done via The DICE Approach web-based training and its companion printed manual. • The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver. As part of usual care, it would be impossible to consent every dyad. As a minimal risk study embedded in primary care practices, we are requesting a waiver of informed consent for PLWD, care partners and clinic staff in order to reduce introduction of artificial care resources or biases wherever possible. Also, requiring consent would introduce artificial care resources and bias which would compromise scientific validity.  • the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information; collecting data on this augmentation of usual care is essential for this research. The knowledge to be gained is critical. Rates of psychotropic use are at all-time highs post-pandemic, putting PLWD at risk for morbidity, mortality and reduced quality of life. .  We require identifiable information for recruitment purposes and for access to the EMR for the historical controls. • The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. This is an augmentation of usual care that is being adopted clinic wide.  The main purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and usability of this intervention in primary care and anticipate that it will benefit PLWD and their care partners.  • There will be minimal PHI data collected and the HER data will be de-identified prior to sending the data to the data analyst in the study. Requiring consent will introduce artificial care resources and bias which would compromise scientific validity.  • The clinicians and/or caregivers who will be applying the strategy post-training will be seeking outcomes and the PLWD will not be trained in The DICE Approach but rather be the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_572411]-pharm behavioral strategies. • Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation. At the end of the study; no information will be provided directly to subjects.  However, we plan to provide information about the results through departmental/HS electronic newsletters, through our CTSC study pages and we will utilize UCD CTSC resources to disseminate the findings to the community at large.  Finally, please note that we do not consider the exit interviews to be a human subjects research activity requiring consent. They consist of Exit interviews of participants (ODCs, other providers and care partners) and will be conducted to further deepen the knowledge of intervention acceptability and implementation challenges.

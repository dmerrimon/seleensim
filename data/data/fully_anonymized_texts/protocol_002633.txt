1(a) Background  
The most intensive pharmacologic lipid lowering therapy with statins, though 
proven superior to standard dose regimens, is still associated with an unacceptably high 
rate of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events early after an acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS). Progression or rupture of lipid rich necrotic core (NC) elements of atherosclerotic 
vulnerable plaque (VP) leads  to a majority of recurrent CV events. Vascular healing by 
[CONTACT_145341] (EPC) play s a crucial role in repair following ischemic injury  
primarily  by [CONTACT_427728]. In 
fact, EPC mobilization while  on statin therapy has been shown to enhance coronary 
blood flow in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), and reduce myocardial 
ischemia and CV events in patients with ACS within a few weeks of treatment. This has 
prompted a continuous drive towards lowering of total cholesterol and specifically low -
density lipoprotein (LDL).  However, what still remains uncertain is  whether the most 
intensive LDL -lowering therapy (ILLT) with LDL -apheresis could lead to a rapid and 
detectable reduction in VP atheroma volume, along with a more robust EPC 
mobilization com pared to standard statin therapy in ACS patients.  
 
 
1(b) Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that in ACS patients undergoing percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI), ILLT with LDL -apheresis plus statin therapy will significantly reduce 
the total atheroma volume of VP and augment mobilization of peripherally circulating 
endothelial progenitor cell colony forming units (EPC -CFU/ml), compared to guideline 
based standard statin monotherapy  alone  (SMT).  We also hypothesize that the total 
number of and the percentage of  patients with major peri -PCI procedure adverse events 
will not be a safety concern for the study.  
 
 
1(c) Specific Objectives  
This is the second phase  of a multi -center trial of ACS patients . The first phase 
was a safety  study involving 31 patients  and was completed in December 2012 . US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  reviewed the safety and efficacy data from the first 
phase  and approved proceeding to this phase . In this trial , 128 participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either initial  LDL-apheresis and an oral daily dose of 40-
80mg of Atorvastatin or equivalent (ILLT group) vs. a daily dose of 40-80mg  of 
Atorvastatin or equivalent without LDL-apheresis (SMT group)  following an 
uncomplicated PCI. Intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology (IVUS -VH) derived 
coronary atheroma volume and composition will be obtained at baseline and [ADDRESS_540531] :

PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 4 2. Background and Significance  
 
2(a) Background  
2(a)(i ). Lowering b lood cholesterol with statins  is well established as a long -term 
strategy to reduce death and ischemic CV events in patients with stable CAD1-3. Major 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_427729] n ew atherosclerotic lesions and stabilizing existing atherosclerotic 
plaques4. In addition, statins can reduce vascular inflammation5, decrease platelet 
aggregability and thrombus deposition6, and increase endothelium -derived nitric oxide 
production7. Most recently, statins have been reported to promote the 
neovascul arization of ischemic tissue in normocholesterolemic animals  by [CONTACT_427730]8. 
 
2(a)(ii) . Aggressive  lipid lowering pharmaco therapy  with statins, though proven 
superior to standard dose regimens, still is associated with an unacceptably high rate of 
recurrent CV events (28.8% )1,9. Moreover, intensive statin regimens are significantly 
underutilized ( 5%) in ACS patients undergoing PCI, who are at highest risk for recurrent 
ischemic events10. ACS patients, who survive through the presentation, have a high rate 
of recurrent ischemic events, e arly after an index event3. This has prompted a 
continuou s drive towards lowering of LDL goals.  
 
2(a)(iii) . Current analysis of statin studies  also cannot definitively determine 
whether the benefit seen with high -dose statins is because of the high statin dose used 
or because low LDL levels are achieved. Our study will provide crucial information in 
this area by [CONTACT_427731] w hich achieves  a rapid drop in LDL levels using initial LDL -
apheresis, followed with 40-80mg daily Atorvastatin or equivalent to SMT with 40-80mg  
daily Atorvastatin  or equivalent . This h as particular relevance in the context of our 
recent publication that showed ACS patients lack the ability to mobilize EPC in 
response to an endovascular injury11. Thus, up-regulation of EPC mobilization with ILLT 
in ACS patients may define a novel mechanism (Figure 1)  and therapeutic strategy to 
improve neovascularization of ischemic myocardium, and endothelialization of VP and 
endovascular stent prosthesis, especially drug -eluting stents. Circulating EPC levels 
also correlate to CV risks and predict CV events12. 
 
2(a)(iv) . Clinical studies  like the Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive 
Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) trial have demonstrated that intensive cholesterol 
lowering with Atorvastatin administered immediately after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427699] 16 weeks13. The 
Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy –Thrombolysis in 
Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT –TIMI 22) trial demonstrated that among patients 
who have recently had an ACS, an intensive lipid -lowering statin regimen provides 
greater protection against death or major CV events than does a standard regimen9. It 
showed a 16% reduction in the hazard ratio favoring intensive therapy. These early 
clinical benefits have  been accompanied by [CONTACT_427732] -coronary 
plaque burden and are thought to be due to the atheroprotective property of mobilized 
EPC14,15. This early effect of statin treatment on clinical endpoints can be partly 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 5 explained by a 1.5 -fold increase in the number of circulating EPC within one week after 
initiation of statin treatment , followed  by [CONTACT_427733] -fold 
throughout the four-week study period in patients with stable CAD16. There are currently 
no studies of EPC mobilization in ACS patients with intensive lipid lowering therapy.

2(a)(v) . Coronary atherosclerosis imaging : Although trials using clinical endpoints 
are the gold standard for evaluating novel atherosclerosis treatments, they are lengthy 
and resource -intensive. Surrogate endpoints, such as coronary angiography and IVUS -
VH, allow  a more cost -effective evaluation of novel treatments. IVUS -VH is a novel 
technology which allows for the identification of discrete plaque components using 
radiofrequency backscatter data17. IVUS can visualize the coronary artery wall and 
measure atherosclerosis volume. The reliability and reproducibility of total atheroma 
volume by [CONTACT_427734], and we have published  
the first report on reproducibility of repeated IVUS -VH measurements in a clinical 
practice setting32. We reported excellent agreement between the two pullback 
measurements for lumen area vessel area and plaque burden. The Spearman rank -
order correlation coefficient s were (0.96, 0.96, and 0.95) for lumen area, vessel area, 
and plaque burden , respectively. (The data  are presented in section 3(d) under "Work 
Accomplished ”). 
IVUS has already been used as an endpoint in long -term trials (REVERSAL , or 
Reversal of Atherosc lerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering18 and ASTEROID , or Study 
to Evaluate the Effect of Rosuvastatin on Intravascular Ultrasound -Derived Coronary 

 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 6 Atheroma Burden19) and in short -term IVUS follow -up trials with Apo -A1 Milano20 and 
delipi[INVESTIGATOR_427700] (HDL) treatments21. Currently there are two clinical 
studies that have evaluated early (≤12 week) IVUS derived coronary atheroma 
regression and  have demonstrated significant regression from baseline with pre -beta 
HDL21 and ApoA -1 Milano20 infusions. The change in atheroma volume in the control 
arm was 2.8mm3 (increase) and that in the treatment arms were -12.18mm3 and -
14.1mm3 with pre -beta HDL and ApoA -[ADDRESS_540534] 
been described in detail in Section 4(g) under "Biostatistical Considerations ." 
 
2(a)(vi) . Endothelial progenitor cells  play a crucial role in repair following 
ischemic injury22. This is achieved primarily by [CONTACT_427735]. Thus, augmentation of circulating EPC in the 
setting of an ACS may significantly contribute to endothelialization of coronary VP, and 
limit myoca rdial ischemic injury22. Increasing the number of circulating EPC by 
[CONTACT_427736] o differentiated EPC 
has been shown to improve neovascularization of ischemic hind limb s23, accelerate 
blood flow in diabetic mice24, and improve cardiac function25. Therefore, augmentation 
of circulating EPC in  the setting of an ACS may significantly contribute to the stimulation 
of neovascularization after tissue ischemia. Recently, EPC mobilization with statin 
therapy has not only been shown to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_427701]26, but also to reduce myocardial ischemia in patients with 
ACS within a few weeks of treatment27, along with a significant increase in circulating 
EPC. The current studies however, cannot definitively determine whether the EPC 
mobilization seen with statins is because of the statin dose used or the degree of LDL 
reduction achieved.  
 
2(a)(vii) . LDL-apheresis  is an extracorporeal blood processing system to acutely 
remove LDL -cholesterol from the plasma28. The approved LIPOSORBER® system will 
be used for the study. It contains dextran sulfate cellulose beads that selectively bind 
Apo-B containing lipoprotei ns (Lp(a), LDL and VLDL). During this procedure, plasma is 
separated from whole blood, LDL cholesterol removed from the plasma, and plasma 
and blood cells are recombined and returned to the patient28. LDL -apheresis treatment 
can lower LDL cholesterol levels by 85% after a single treatment. In familial 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (FH) patients, this significant lowering of the LDL cholesterol level is not 
maintained due to a metabolic defect that causes the overproduction of LDL cholesterol. 
The LDL cholesterol level begins to increase (or rebound) after treatment, eventually 
returning to baseline in about one to three weeks, requiring recurrent treatments28. We 
do not expect non -FH ACS patients to rebound rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] , especially on continued statin 
therapy. We therefore propose using only one init ial treatment with LDL -apheresis to 
achieve a rapid reduction in LDL -cholesterol, with follow -up guideline based lipid 
lowering pharmacotherapy with statins.  
LIPOSORBER® treatment is very selective in removing LDL cholesterol, and 
does not affect HDL and t riglyceride (TG) levels. A mean reduction in plasma proteins 
(15%), fibrinogen (29%), and platelets (5%) may be observed and rarely pose a risk to 
the patient28,29. Approximately 300,000 treatments with the  LIPOSORBER® system 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/[ADDRESS_540535] been performed worldwide on over 2,500 patients. Possible adverse reactions 
include hypotension, nausea/vomiting, flushing, chest pain, fainting, lightheadedness, 
anemia, abdominal discomfort, numbness/tingling, tachycardia, headache, shortness of 
breath, hemolysis, bradycardia, itching/hives, bleeding (due to the use of unfractionated 
heparin) and chills28. Hypotension is the most common, and in US trials , occurred in 
<1% of all treatments and was treated  effectively with intravenous fluids. If an ACE 
(angiotensin converting enzyme )-inhibitor is used to manage th e patient's blood 
pressure; it should be held [ADDRESS_540536] on arterial blood flow. Tamai et al . demonstrated that a single LDL -apheresis 
treatment increased nitrous oxide production and forearm blood flow29. A single 
treatm ent with LDL -apheresis has also been shown to significantly reduce modified LDL 
particle, remnant -like particle -cholesterol, and C -reactive protein30. In the LACMART 
study, one LDL-apheresis treatment over one year lowered the LDL of FH patien ts 
aggressively and demonstrated a significant reduction in the plaque area and increase 
in the minimum luminal diameter (MLD) with an annual angiographic and IVUS follow -
up31. It also demonstrated that the benefits  of LDL -apheresis are substantial when used 
in the setting of a statin pharmacotherapy. It is important to point out that in the FH 
population, the LDL cholesterol level in  the medication -only arm did not change 
significantly from baseline (174 ±39mg/dl to 181±53mg/dl), and with LDL -apheresis it 
decreased from 213 ±25mg/dl to 140 ±27mg/dl, which is much higher than the expected 
post-LDL-apheresis LDL levels expected in non -FH ACS patients. The details of 
atheroma regression are described in section 4(g) , “Biostatistical Considerations ”. 
Thus, we believe that the proposed ILLT strategy to jumpstart aggressive LDL 
reduction post -ACS is expected to have significant pathophysiologic and biochemical 
effects, in addition to significant atheroma regression expecte d with nearly 85% 
reduction in serum LDL levels. Though the vasoactive effects of LDL -apheresis are well 
known, its effect on EPC mobil ization has never been studied. Our proposal will for the 
first time test this hypothesis and lay the foundation for a de dicated mechanistic study in 
the near future.  
 
 
2(b) Relevance to Veterans Health  
We believe that our proposed strategy would provide the basis for a large -scale 
study to evaluate clinical endpoints as a primary objective and ultimately lead to the 
develop ment of a new strategy to attain more aggressive therapeutic lipid goals, and 
reduce CV events post -ACS, reduce the socioeconomic burden of ischemic heart 
disease, and improve the quality of life of our veterans .

3(a) EPC Study  in ACS  
We have reported that EPC levels rise in response to PCI in p atients with stable 
coronary lesions. In contrast, patients with unstable coronary lesions or ACS failed to 
mobilize EPC in response to PCI (Figure 2) . 
These data, the first in humans undergoing PCI, are consistent with a protective 
role for EPC mobilization. In this study, we investigated the effect of a discrete 
endovascular insult on human EPC recruitment into the peripheral circulation11. By 
[CONTACT_342310] a defined clinical procedure, we were able to compare EPC levels before, 
and early after the manipulation at reproducible time points, avoiding possible 
nonspecific perturbations.

3(c) LDL-apheresis in Patients with CAD  
Our group, under the directorship of Dr . Ravindra Sarode  (Director LDL -
apheresis center, University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) , has 
performed 12 uneventful LDL -apheresis sessions in two patients with CAD. One patient 
underwent LDL -apheresis every week, and the second every two weeks. Average 
reduction of LDL was approximately 84% after each session. Both patients have also 
been maintained on low dose statin therapy.  
From our experience in the first phase of the PREMIER trial, there wa s one 
transient h ypotension epi[INVESTIGATOR_427703] 20 patients randomized to LDL -apheresis 
after PCI  for ACS . The event resolved spontaneously and was a ttributed to mictur ition. 
 
3(d) Identification of Coronary Atheroma with IVUS -VH in ACS Patients 
undergoing  PCI 
The principal investigators (PI's) perform over 2 ,300 cardiac catheterizations and 
500 coronary interventions annually, of which >80% are IVUS -VH guided. Coronary 
angiographic image acquisition, quantitative coronary angiographic analysis (QCA) 
using the Phillips proprietary software is performed by [CONTACT_978] ’s. The  quantitative  IVUS -
VH image acquisition, live measurements of vessel diameter, cross -sectional area, 
plaque volume, and plaque composition assessments (QIVUS) are made by [CONTACT_978] ’s32. 
Figure 5 demonstrates  typi[INVESTIGATOR_427704] s and measurements made during a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_427705]. These procedures can be performed reproducibly and safely by [CONTACT_978] ’s. 
The overall annual complication rate of our cardiac catheterization laboratory is 1.6%, of 
which 85% consist pri marily of minor access site complications.

The reliability and reproducibility of total  atheroma volume by [CONTACT_427740], and the PI's have published the first report on 
reproducibility of repeated IVUS -VH measurements in a clinical practice setting32. We 
reported excellent  Bland -Altman plots demonstrating reproduc ibility data for mean 
vessel area (a), lumen area (b), fibrous tissue (c), fibrofatty tissue (d), necrotic core (e), 
and dense calcification (f), respectively , agreement between the two pullback 
measurements for lumen area vessel area, and plaque burden (d ata not shown). The 
Spearman rank -order correlation coefficients were (0.96, 0.96, and 0.95) for lumen 
area, vessel area, and plaque burden respectively.  
VH analysis Spearman rank -order correlation coefficients between pullback trials 
for the fibrous, fibr ofatty, necrotic core, and dense calcium measurements were (0.97, 
0.90, 0.90, 0.90) respectively and indicated a high level of reliability (data not shown). 
Coefficients ranged from 0.90 to 0.97 (p<0.0001). The Bland -Altman plots (Figures 6a -
f, above) indicated proportional error for the differences of the four measurements 
between the pullback trials. Accordingly, the CR values were less than z=1.96, ranging 
from 0.33 to 1.66.

PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/[ADDRESS_540538] phase  was a 
safety study , in which 31 ACS patients were  randomized to either ILLT (device) group or 
SMT (control) group with a randomization scheme of 2:1 (20 ILLT patients and 10 SMT 
patients) . After all [ADDRESS_540539] stage complet ed the 
6-month  follow -up visit, the study data (for both safety and efficacy) was submit ted to 
FDA for review. FDA approved continuation  to the second phase for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] , 
which  will include 128 ACS patients randomized to either ILLT (device) group or SMT 
(control) group with a randomization scheme of 1:1  (64 in ILLT device group and 64 in 
SMT control group) . 
 
4(a) Study Objectives  
The safety objective of this study is to collect additional  safety data for ACS 
patients who undergo the LDL-apheresis  post-PCI procedure and the use of maximum 
dose of statin drugs.   
The primary effectiveness objective of this study is to compare the total atheroma 
volume within a ≥ 20 mm long segment  of the target coronary artery in ACS patients 
with an uncomplicated PCI randomly assigned to LDL -apheresis with 40-80mg daily of 
Atorvastatin or equ ivalent (ILLT group) or 40-80mg  daily of Atorvastatin or equivalent 
only (SMT group). The specific hypothesis being tested is: ILLT is superior to SMT in 
reducing the total atheroma volume at 90 days  IVUS -VH follow up.  
The secondary effectiveness objectives of this study will be: (1) to compare %NC 
component of atheroma within a ≥ 20 mm long segment  of the target coronary artery; 
(2) to compare the EPC -CFU/ml of peripheral blood in the two treatment groups; and  (3) 
to compare MACE, associated with the two treatment groups at 90 days  and at 6 month 
follow -up. 
Rationale for study effectiveness objectives : The rationale for the study 
effectiveness objectives include s the observation of increased recurrent CV events in 
ACS patients early (three months) post-index event, despi[INVESTIGATOR_427706], due to progression and rupture of non -critical coronary lesions. 
Aggressive LDL lowering using LDL -apheresis (ILLT) as proposed in this study will test 
a novel strategy of non -critical coronary at heroma regression at 90 days , and hence 
reduce early ( 12-week) MACE events in ACS patients, sustained at end of study (at 
least six months follow -up). We also propose to test whether EPC mobilization with 
aggressive LDL lowering correlates with coronary at heroma regression, change in 
atheroma composition (%NC), and MACE events. We acknowledge that the scope of 
this study does not test the mechanism of EPC targeting to site of coronary VP and its 
endothelialization, however, it would provide for the first ti me important initial evidence 
which could be tested in future dedicated studies.  
We expect to demonstrate a significant reduction in atheroma volume at 90 days  
by [CONTACT_427741] -VH (primary endpoint) because this study will have the most aggressive LDL 
lowering stra tegy in ACS patients ever tested in non -FH ACS patients. The 12-week 
time period is also the time point when early post -ACS CV events begin to increase, as 
seen in the PROVE IT –TIMI [ADDRESS_540540] 
evaluated early (≤12 week) IVUS derived coronary atheroma regression and have 
demonstrated significant regression from baseline with pre -beta HDL21 and ApoA -1

HDL and ApoA -[ADDRESS_540541] been described in det ail in Section 4(g) under "Biostatistical 
Considerations".  
 
 
4(b) Study Outcome Measures  
The primary safety outcome measure s will be the total number of and percentage 
of patients with major peri -PCI procedure adverse events, such as hypotension, angina, 
myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction (if the patient is determined to have had 
unstable angina rather than non -ST-elevation MI at admission), cerebrovascular event (CVA), 
vermicular tachycardia, bleeding (at the PCI access and apheresis cannu lation sites in the 
apheresis patients and at the PCI access site in the non -apheresis control patients), and 
death . The p eri-PCI procedure is defined as encompassing the time of the PCI procedure 
and the time of the subsequent LDL-apheresis procedure  for ILLT group vs. the time of the 
PCI procedure for SMT group . All LDL-apheresis -related adverse events in the ILLT group, 
including any minor expected events, w ill be recorded.  
The secondary safety outcome measure s will be  the total number of and percentage 
of patients with statin -related abnormal liver function test events and statin -related muscle injury 
events, which could occur due to the maximum dose of statin drugs being given to both the 
ILLT group  and SMT group  patients. The s tatin-related muscle injury is defined as a muscle 
injury which cannot be attributed to a non -statin cause and which is evidenced by [CONTACT_23805] 
(muscle soreness, pain, or tenderness) and/or lab tests such as serum total creati ne 
phosphokinase (CPK), CPK -MM, or myoglobin . 
The primary effectiveness outcome measure will be the change in the total 
atheroma volume within a ≥ [ADDRESS_540542]-PCI. The measurement will be done via IVUS -VH at both 
centers of investigati on.  
The secondary effectiveness outcome measures will include the %NC 
component of atheroma, EPC -CFU/ml of peripheral blood , and major adverse 
cardiovascular endpoints (MACE ) including death, myocardial infarction, coronary 
revascularization, and stroke  during the follow -up periods. The cell culture assay and 
quantification of circulating EPC -CFU will be done for patients recruited at the Dallas VA  
center. The major adverse CV events will be collected via both clinical visit and 
searches of the Austin da tabase for VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427707]. Approvals for 
using the patients’ Social Security numbers for data searching will be obtained.  
 
 
4(c) Study Design and Procedures  
The proposed study is a multi -center, randomized controlled study comparing 
atheroma volume, %NC component , and peripherally circulating EPC -CFU/ml of blood

on ACE inhibitors will either have it discontinued or switched to an angiotensin receptor 
blocking agent (ARB).  All screen eligible patients will be subsequently asked to sign an 
IRB-approved informed consent form prior to clinically indicate d PCI or any subsequent 
study related tests . 
ACS is defined as chest discomfort lasting at least [ADDRESS_540543] 24h, 
new ≥lmm ST -wave or dynamic T -wave changes in at least two contiguous EKG leads 
but without significant ST elevation, and/or troponin I or T levels above the 99th 
percentile.  Abnormal LFT is defined as any liver transaminases  (ALT or AST)  ≥ 3 times 
the upper limit of the normal laboratory reference. Atorvastatin 40-80mg will be 
considered equivalent to 20-40mg of Rosuvastatin.  Patients on Simvastatin at the time 
of enrollment will be switched to Atorvastatin 40-80 mg or Rosuvastatin  20-40 mg . 
After  PCI of the target or culprit coronary artery (as determined by [CONTACT_73693]) 
and IVUS -VH analysis of a ≥20mm segment of the target coronary artery are performed  
during the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427710] , the patients will be 
randomized to ILLT or SMT if they meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure 7, 
blue arrow). PCI will be perform ed using standard technique at the discretion of the 
operator. 40-80mg daily Atorvastatin or equivalent treatments (ILLT or SMT) will be 
initiated within 24  hours after randomization . Patients randomized to the ILLT arm will 
undergo LDL -apheresis within  36 hours after presentation unless the 36-hour window is 
mandatory for those who were on ACE inhibitors  to allow for the complete washout  of 
ACE inhibitors. Adjunctive anti -platelet and anti -thrombin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_427711]. Refer to Figure 8  for all study

electrocardiogram, lipid panel, basic metabolic panel (BMP)  with LFT, complete blood 
count, and complete cardiac catheterization, PCI , IVUS -VH and adjunctive pharmaco -
therapy data will be collected on all eligible patients apart from demographic and 
contact [CONTACT_3031].  
 
4(c)(v) . Stratification and Randomization : Prior to randomizing a patient, all 
screening and baseline assessments must be completed and the patient determined to 
be eligible for inclusion in the study. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two 
treatment groups (ILLT or SMT) following  an un complicated index PCI . 40-80mg daily 
Atorvastatin  or equivalent statin  medication  treatment  (ILLT or SMT)  will be initiated 
within 24h after randomization and  LDL-apheresis for ILLT group will be  initiated within  
36 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427712] 36-hour window is mandatory for those who 
were on ACE inhibitors  to allow for the complete washout  of ACE inhibitors. Refer to 
Figure 8  for all study timelines. Screening and randomization will be performed by a 
study coordinator, and LDL -apheresis will be  conducted by a contracted specialized 
apheresis nurse.  
 
4(c)(v)(1) . Randomization Methods:  The randomization scheme and associated 
codes will be developed by [CONTACT_427743] 
(CSPCC). Permuted block randomization with random block sizes will be employed to 
assign patients to either ILLT or SMT  in a 1:1 ratio .  The randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_427744].  
 
4(c)(v)(2) . Randomization and Blinding Procedures:  Following an uncomplicated 
PCI procedure , patients who  are eligible and willing to participate in the study will be 
randomly assigned to either the ILLT or SMT arm using  an automated telephone -based 
randomization system . A touch -tone phone is necessary to use this Voice Information 
System (VIS)  to randomize eligible subjects. CSPCC will assign each site a unique [ADDRESS_540544] (or add/update an SSN). The VIS will query the unblinded staff for subject 
information and c onfirm these data prior to determining the subject's treatment group 
assignment.  A copy of the appropriately executed consent and HIPAA authorization 
documents must be on file at the Hines CSPCC within 24 hours of randomization. If the  
VIS is not working  during normal business hours , the research coordinator can 
telephone the Hines CSPCC staff to randomize a patient. The subjects or Site 
Investigators  will not be blinded to the study treatment assignment ; however all follow -
up visits and endpoint adjudications will be performed by a dedicated study nurse 
blinded to treatment allocation . Patients will be cautioned not to reveal his/her treatment 
allocation to the blinded study nurse. This blinding precaution will be emphasized by [CONTACT_427745][INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/[ADDRESS_540545] the opportunity , after PCI, to decline 
participat ion in the study and will not be randomized if they choose not to participate.  
 
 
4(d) Intervention  and Treatment  
The randomized treatment regimens of this study include:  
(i) ILLT 
(ii) SMT  
 
4(d)(i): ILLT: Patients randomized to ILLT will undergo LDL -apheresis within  36h 
after presentation with an ACS  unless th e 36-hour window  is mandatory  for those who 
were on ACE inhibitors . All ILLT patients will also be started on Atorvastatin 40-80mg 
daily or equivalent within 24h after randomization. Patients will be continued on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
81-325mg and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [ADDRESS_540546] will supervise LDL -apheresis at the other study 
center s. Bilateral large bore brachial venous intravenous access will be obtained and 
the patient connected to the  LIPOSORBER® machine. Pre-existing intravenous access 
sites can be used for this purpose to minimize patient discomfort associated with 
additional IV placements. Each machine has two apheresis columns. The system is 
primed with heparinized Lactated Ringer’s injection , and [ADDRESS_540547] column is regenerated 
using a 5% Sodium Chloride Injection, eluting the LDL, VLDL and Lp(a). When e lution is 
completed and flushed through the waste lines to a waste bag, the column is reprimed 
completely and ready for the next cycle of adsorption, allowing continuous LDL -
apheresis. No additional fluids are given to the patient during column switchover , and 
only the treated plasma is returned. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_427713].  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_427714]® settings are:  
Extracorporeal volume = approx. 400ml (170ml blood, 230ml plasma)  
Plasma volume treated = approx. 0.7 x kg body weight x hematocrit  
Treatment time = 2 -4 hours  
LDL-C acute reduction = 73 -83% 
Unfractiona ted heparin dose = 45 units/kg (of which 75% given as a single IV 
bolus dose at the initiation of LDL -apheresis, and the rest to be delivered via 
an IV infusion at the rate of 1 ml/hr [1000 units/ml formulation]). Heparin 
infusion to be stopped 30 minutes prior to the estimated end of treatment.  
 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 19 Machine settings  ranges include:  
Treatment volume = 0 -9950 ml plasma  
Whole blood flow rate = 0 -150ml/min 
Plasma flow rate = 0 -40% of whole blood flow  rate 
Heparin infusion rate = 0 -5ml/hr 
Blood warmer temp = 35 -40°C 
 
All patients randomized to ILLT will receive Atorvastatin  40-80mg daily or equivalent 
within 24 hours after randomization.  
 
4(d)(ii). SMT : Standard medical therapy will include Atorvastatin 40-80mg  daily or 
equivalent  initiated within 24h after randomization. Patients will be initiated on 
Atorvastatin 40-80mg if their outpatient medication included Atorvastatin ≤ 80mg or 
equivalent dose of statin. Atorvastatin 40-80mg will be considered equivalent to 
Rosuvastatin  20-40mg. In the event of a restrictive formulary change of preferred statin 
drug within the VA system, the drug equivalency statement will serve as the referen ce 
for statin drug changes to meet the inclusion/exclusion and study follow -up LDL -goals 
as per the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) and the latest ACC/AHA 
Lipid Lowering Therapy  guidelines33,37. 
The study will not enroll patients with known history of allergy or contraindications 
to statin therapy. If a patient is shown to be intolerant to the treatment of Atorvastatin 
40-80mg daily or equiva lent after randomized into the study, the Site Investigator may 
use an alternative statin provided above ( Simvastatin  or Rosuvastatin ). If the intolerance 
remains unresolved, the Site Investigator may adjust the doses or even discontinue the 
statin therapy  per clinical needs. These patients will still be followed up and included in 
the final analysis based on the intent -to-treat principle.  
4(d)(iii). Follow -up and study terminations : All participants will return for their 
scheduled study follow -up visits fo r six months. Participants will have the right to 
withdraw from the study at any time. However, Site Investigators may not withdraw a 
participant from the study without just cause and without the approval of the Study 
Chair.  
 
 
 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 20 4(e) Follow -up Assessments  
All study patients will undergo IVUS -VH analysis  at index PCI and at follow -up. A 
minimum distance of 10mm away from the PCI site is the preferred site to visualize the 
atheroma volume with IVUS -VH. Patients will return at 90 days  from index PCI for 
repeat  cardiac catheterization and ≥20mm matched target coronary artery segment 
IVUS -VH at the exact same site as that of baseline using similar projections and side 
branch and/or calcification reference (Figure 5) using the technique published by [CONTACT_88226]29. A core laboratory  consisting of two experienced cardiologists blinded to the 
study treatment allocation will review baseline and follow -up coronary arteriograms and 
IVUS -VH of each patient in the study. These two cardiologists will be independent and 
have n o direct relationship to the study team . If any disagreement occurs  between these 
two cardiologist s regard ing the angiogram or IVUS -VH interpretation, a third cardiologist 
will be referred to review the data and break the tie. After visual evaluation, quantitative 
analysis (QCA) will be performed using a standard automated edge -detection method. 
Angiographic restenosis is defined as >50% reduction in minimum luminal diameter 
(MLD) of the intervened segment during index PCI.

PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 21 Atheroma volumes  within a ≥ 20 mm long segment  of a target coronary artery 
segment will be compared to assess change in total atheroma volume and %NC  
volume. Vessel and lumen area will be calculated for each frame, using previously 
published methods18. Atheroma burden will be calculated as [(EEM area – Lumen 
area)/EEM area ] or expressed as a percent change [(EEM area – Lumen area )/EEM 
area) x 100]18.VH analysis will be performed for each segment, and the area of each 
plaque constituent (fibrous, fibrofatty, calcific, and necrotic core) will be determined in 
an automated fashion using Volcano S5 software version 2.2.3.2236 (Volcano Corp., 
Rancho Cordova, CA)32 (Figure 9) . Follow -up cardiac catheterization and IVUS -VH 
analysis as described above will be performed at [ADDRESS_540548] intensive LDL reduction ever achieved in ACS patients. All follow -up IVUS -VH 
analyses will be compared to baseline IVUS -VH obtained during the index cardiac 
catheterization. A more long-term (1 or 2 year) IVUS -VH follow -up is not expected  to 
demonstrate the treatment effect instituted immediately after ACS and has been well 
described with Nissen et al . with aggressive long-term LDL lowering18. Acute changes in 
coronary atheroma have traditionally been studied by [CONTACT_69506] -term IVUS 
assessments20,21. 
 
If a patient has a clinically indicated catheterization within two months of the 
scheduled study procedure, this would be considered as the follow -up procedure and 
the operator will be encouraged to  procure all study -related data.  
 
Peripheral blood sampling for EPC quantification will be performed using cell 
culture only at VA North [LOCATION_007] center in Dallas. This will ensure an optimal number (at 
least 50) uniformly standardized and cost -effective EPC cell culture assays  in this multi -
center study . A limited number (n=25) of FACS EPC analysis will be performed to 
correlate cell culture and FACS levels of circulating EPC. Such a correlation would be 
important to demonstrate if future large -scale use of this treatment strategy of EPC 
mobilization is to be implemented with the rapid and less cumbersome FACS instead of 
the established standard of EPC cell culture technique. Approximately 10 ml of whole 
blood is needed for either assay. Cell culture assay bas ed upon our published 
methodology11 will be performed ≤[ADDRESS_540549] methodology34. All EPC sampling schedules are indicated in 
Figure 8 and in Table 1, along with all other scheduled clinical and laboratory tests. All 
EPC analyses will be compared to baseline pre -PCI levels. Table 1 summarizes all 
planned follow -up visits and tests.  
 
Follow -up tests  like fasting lipid (FL) will be performed immediately  following 
LDL-apheresis in ILLT device group at about [ADDRESS_540550] -PCI 30-day

for a 4-month  study visit with CBC, BMP, LFT and FL. After an additional 60 days , or at 
6 month s from index PCI, all patients will return for a study completion visit and a FL 
assay. Any MACE will also be collected via searching the Austin database of VA 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427715]. This dual MACE assessment will help avoid 
missing out on any participating site  MACE.  
 
All adverse event, serious adverse event and MACE assessments during follow -
up will be performed during patient int erviews or history and physical assessments and 
phone interviews, as indicated in Table 1.

4(f) Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Assessments and 
Reporting  
 
4(f)(i).  Role of the Local Site Investigator in Adverse Event Monitoring :  The local 
Site Investigator will be responsible for following adverse event reporting requirements:  
(1). Reviewing the accuracy and completeness of all adverse events reported  
(2). Complying with study policies as well as local IRB policies for reportin g 
serious adverse events  or problems involving risks to subjects or others 
in VA research.  
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 25 (3). Reporting to the IRB any safety issues reported to the site by [CONTACT_429] (Study Chair), and  
(4). Closely monitoring of study  participants  for any new Adverse Events 
(AE), Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects ( UADE), or Serious Adverse 
Events (SAE).  
 
4(f)(ii) . Definitions :  
 
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharm aceutical  product and does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment .” An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable or un intended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study intervention , whether or not 
related to the study intervention . 
 
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is one that results in any of the following 
outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194636], a persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events  that may no t result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may 
require a medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
 
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  (UADE) means any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associate d with, a device if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in 
nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan  or application, or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the  rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
All AE/ SAE/ UADE with a reasonable causal relationship to the investigative 
treatment should be considered at least “possibly related .” A definite relationship does 
not need to be established. For the purpose of this trial potential investigative -treatment -
related AE/ SAE/ UADE can be classified into three categories:  
 
(1). Related to LDL -apheresis : hypotension (most common, <1% of treatments in US), 
nausea/vomiting, flushing, chest pain, fainting, lightheadedness, anem ia, abdominal 
discomfort, numbness/tingling, tachycardia, headache, shortness of breath, hemolysis, 
bradycardia, itching/hives , bleeding  due to the use of unfractionated heparin or l ow 
platelet count (thrombocytopenia), low Vitamin E level, temporary decre ase in blood 
protein level, v ertigo (dizziness, unsteadiness) and excess sweating . 
(2). Related to statin use : muscle pain, generalized body pains, nausea/vomiting, 
abnormal liver function test ( ≥ 3 times above the upper limit of the normal laboratory 
reference values of the study institution), and rhabdomyolysis . Also, on February 28, 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 26 2012, the FDA notified clinicians of  the following possible effects of statin use: cognitive 
(memory loss or confusion ), which usually rev erses after st oppi[INVESTIGATOR_265255] ; and 
increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) that could lead to a diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes mellitus . Specifically regarding Lovastatin (Mevacor ©), the FDA said  that statin 
in combination with some other medications —including HIV  protease inhibitors ( e.g. 
tipranavir plus ritonavir and lopi[INVESTIGATOR_245049] ) and hepatitis C  protease inhibitors  
(e.g. telapravir) , and drugs used to treat certain bacterial (e.g. erythromycin, 
clarithromycin) and fungal infections (e.g. fluconazole,  itraconazole, posaconazole, and  
voriconazole) —can increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. The FDA said 
serious liver injury due to statin use is rare .  
(3). Related to follow -up cardiac catheterization and IVUS -VH: The risk of follow -up 
study -related cardiac catheterization and IVUS -VH include bleeding, groin pain, 
arrhythmia, hypotension, pericardial effusion, blood clots, infection, allergic reaction to 
the dye, perforated blood vessel, air embolism, myocardial i nfarction, stroke, renal 
failure , and death. Local groin discomfort and minor access site hematoma (<3 cm in 
diameter) are most common. Death is rare (<0.04%) , and the risk of MI and stroke is 
<0.5%.  
(The examples in these categories are not exhaustive , and investigators should 
not feel limited by [CONTACT_427746] “related” or “possibly related” 
if other AE/ SAE/ UADE occurs  that in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_427717].)  
 
4(f)(iv). AE and SAE Monitoring and Reporting :  AE/ SAE/ UADE will be monitored 
at the study sites throughout the whole period of the study at each clinic visit and 
telephone contact, beginning as soon as a study participant signs the Informed Consent 
and continuing through end-of-study for each participant. All AE/ SAE/ UADE including 
both those related to the study intervention and those not related to the intervention , will 
be collected and recorded on the appropriate case report forms (CRF) . For the purpose 
of safety monito ring, the study intervention is defined as the use of 1) statins with or 
without the addition of LDL -apheresis, 2) LDL -apheresis, and 3) follow -up cardiac 
catheterization and IVUS -VH as described in this protocol.  
All SAE s require expedited reporting . The SAE report form should be completed 
and faxed to CSPCC/CSPCRPCC/Study Chair Office s within [ADDRESS_540552] will be responsible for 
evaluating all serious adverse events for patient safety concerns . In addition, a Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) will be formed to adjudicate adverse events  in the study . The 
committee involves a physician from CSPCC, a Q.A./ safety monitor from CSPCC, and 
the AE Pharmacist from CSPC RPCC. The committee is indepe ndent from the Study 
Chair and the Site Investigators.  
Serious adverse events that are related to the investigative treatment and 
unexpected will be reported to the FDA, CSP Director, and Site Investigators after 
review by [CONTACT_64362], the  CSPCRPCC  Director and the CSPCC Director. Site 
investigators should follow local policy  to inform their IRB. The Hines CSPCC will 
generate tabulations of all AE/SAE/ UADE for the Data Monitoring Committee annually

4(g) Biostatistical Considerations  
 
4(g)(i) . Expected Treatment Effect: There is only one study which examined the 
treatment of medication only (20 mg Pravastatin or 10 mg Simvastatin) vs . LDL-
apheresis  with statin medication on coronary plaque regression in familial 
hypercholesterolemia and published in 2002 Journal of American College of 
Cardiology31. The trial reported the net change of plaque area from baseline to one year 
follow -up. The changes were -0.69±2.08 mm2 in the LDL -apheresis group vs. 
0.88±1.[ADDRESS_540554] shown similar 
magnitude of atheroma r egression at 6 -10 weeks, without directly lowering LDL levels.  
Given the expected 85% reduction in LDL after LDL -apheresis, we expect ed to observe 
a similar  treatment effect for the primary effectiveness outcome of this study at 90 days . 
 
4(g)(ii) . Sample Size/Power/Level of Significance : To maintain 90% power to 
detect a  Cohen’s D effect size of 0.65 ( -0.38 ± 2.08 mm2 in the LDL -A group vs. 0.88  ± 
1.75 mm2 in the medication only group ) with the randomization scheme of 1:1 , α = 0.05 , 
and a 20% drop -out rate, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_427718] a sample size of 128.  
 
4(g)(iii) . Study Duration /Number of Sites: Four sites are considered for the 
purpose of generalizability and improved enrollment. Based on the enrollment rate in 
stage [ADDRESS_540555] to randomize 18 patients per site per year with 
an average rate of  1.5 patients per site per month.  The average annual PCI volume 
during FY 2012 – 2013 reported by [CONTACT_427747]#571 currently e nrolled at these 4 sites indicate that they will be able to meet or 
exceed the target of 18 participants per year. The percentage of patients with PCI who 
need to be randomized ranges from 3.5% to 5.0% across the four sites based on these 
reported annual P CI volume. About 30% of eligib le subjects who meet the 3 major 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (ACS, LDL, and eGFR)  need to be randomized in order to 
meet the accrual target.  Dallas and Oklahoma City sites have ongoing LDL -apheresis 
capability and equipment o n-site at the VA campus, and the Nashville and Denver  sites 
have approved LDL -apheresis sites supported by [CONTACT_427748] (Kaneka) that 
will expedite the induction of these sites into the study . 
 
A total of 22 months is needed for 4 sites to randomize the total sample size of 
128 in this second stage. The whole study duration for the second stage is expected to

4(g)(iv). Statistical Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint :  
The primary effectiveness outcome will be analyzed with intent -to-treat (ITT) 
approach by [CONTACT_427751] -out. The 
change in total atheroma volume within a ≥ [ADDRESS_540557] a 90-day atheroma volume 
measurement. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed to evaluate the 
treatment effect on primary effectiveness outcome adjusting for age, pre -existing CAD, 
pre-existing diabetes, and baseline LDL levels.  
 
4(g)(v) . Statistical Analysis of Secondary  Effectiveness Endpoints :  
The intent -to-treat principle will also be applied to all the secondary effectiveness 
outcomes analyses.  
(1). The change of %NC  component of atheroma from baseline to [ADDRESS_540558]. Similarly, the change scores 
for those who miss the 90 days  follow up assessment will be set to zero. 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed to evaluate the 
treatment effect on primary effectiveness outcome adjusting for age, pre -
existing CAD, p re-existing diabetes, and baseline LDL levels.  
(2). The EPC -CFU/ml of peripheral blood assessed at various time points 
(pre-PCI, post -PCI, 30 days  of follow -up, and 90 days  of follow -up) will be 
analyzed via Mixed Linear models with random intercepts . The treat ment 
effect, time effect and their interaction will be considered with or without 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/[ADDRESS_540559] is the 
time by [CONTACT_9866] . 
(3). Contrasts will be used in the Mixed Linear models to compare the 
differences among any specifically interested tim e points .  
 
4(g)(vi) . Statistical Analysis of Safety Endpoints and Complications : The primary 
safety endpoints, the secondary safety endpoints, and the incidence of major adverse 
cardiovascular endpoints (MACE) including death, myocardial infarction, coron ary 
revascularization, and stroke will be analyzed in two ways. For each type of event, the 
percentage of people who experience the event at least once will be compared using 
the chi -square test. Logistic regression models will be performed to adjust for t he 
covariates such as age, pre -existing CAD , and pre -existing diabetes. In addition, a 
similar analysis will be done for all AE and SAE that are possibly or probably attributable 
to the study intervention.  
An event -based analysis will also be done s ince adverse events can be 
recurrent . In this analysis , a non -parametric method called the mean cumulative 
function (MCF) 35,36 will be used as an alternative to the above crude incidence rate 
analyses . The overall safety profiles as well as the safety profiles in specific subgroups 
over the whole study period will be compared for the two randomization groups 
including the times of event recurrence and censoring mechanisms .     
Time to event (survival analysis) will also compare the time to first MACE 
between treatment groups. A second survival anal ysis will be performed to identify risk 
predictors and to evaluate whether the observed treatment effect is modified by 
[CONTACT_427752] -existing CAD and pre -existing diabetes.  
 
4(g)(vii). Interim Monitoring : Hines CSPCC will produce a  progress report every 
six months for review by [CONTACT_276746] . The report will include figures for 
patient accrual, tables for baseline characteristics, site performance, data quality, 
treatment compliance, and safety issues.  Group sequenti al methods will be used to 
specify the α -levels in order to maintain the overall significance level at α = 0.[ADDRESS_540560]. The sequential analyses will use O’Brien -Fleming 
boundaries with an overall α = 0.05 for significanc e and 90% for power. EAST software 
was used to obtain the interim monitoring rule and the adjusted sample size.  The look 
will be around 50% of the target sample size (about 6 4 patients) completing the 90-day 
follow -up visit as DMC recommended at its first  meeting on September 25, 2009. The 
sample size remains at [ADDRESS_540561] the null hypothesis. However, if the 
critical value is between -2.9626 and 2.96 26, the study will continue until the target 
sample size is met for final analysis.  
 
4(g)(vii i). Subgroup Analyses : Since acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is 
manifested as either unstable angina or non -ST-elevation myocardial infarction, both 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/[ADDRESS_540562] and confirm the 
appropriateness of pooling the data for primary endpoint.       
 
4(g)( ix). Sensitivity Analysis for Missing Data : In addition to the above mentioned 
ITT principle for primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes in which  the change 
scores  will be set  to zero if the follow -up assessment is missing, other approaches will 
be applied in order to assess the robustness of t he study results to assumptions about 
the missing data . For outcomes about atheroma  volume and % of NC component of 
atheroma  which will be measured only at 2 time points , the sensitivity analysis 
approaches include : 1) performing analysis only on complete data, 2) applying the worst 
case scenario (set the lowest  score at baseline and the highest score at 90-day), and 3) 
generating imputes for  missing data  with multiple imputation . For outcome  about EPC-
CFU/ml of peripheral blood  which will be  repeatedly  measured at four time points, the 
sensitivity analysis approaches include: 1) performing analysis only on complete data, 
and 2) using the mixed model for repeated measures.  
 
All tests will be two -sided. The critical level for all the primary and secondary  
outcomes will be 0.05. No adjustments will be made for multiple secondary endpoints.  
 
 
4(h) Quality Assurance , Oversight and Study Regulation  
 
4(h)(i) Training to assure accuracy, precision and validity of the data : Toward the 
end of the six-month start -up period, training of study personnel will take place during a 
two-day kick -off meeting. All participating investigators, site research 
coordinators/raters, and Hines CSPCC personnel will be in attendance. Prior to the 
meeting, case report fo rms will be finalized and a detailed manual of study operations 
will be written and circulated. This manual will serve as the training manual for the 
meeting and as a reference document following the meeting. The PI’s office and the 
data and pharmacy coord inating centers will provide the training. The general training 
will include the study treatment, patient screening and consent, baseline evaluation, 
follow -up procedures, and proper entry and maintenance of data. Cyber security 
awareness training and priv acy training (VHA Privacy Policy, Protection of Human 
Research Subjects, and Good Clinical Practices) are required annually of all VA and 
VA-WOC employees.  
 
4(h)(ii) . Data Management and Security  
 
4(h)(ii)( 1). Data Collection : An operations manual and case  report forms will be 
developed jointly with Hines CSPCC . The site study coordinator s will collect all data. 
After a patient consents to participate in the study, the site coordinator will create a 
patient casebook, which will contain the consent forms, al l relevant source documents, 
and any other information pertinent to the study.  The completed case report forms will 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 31 be assembled and faxed to Hines CSPCC for further handling on a daily basis. These 
original completed paper forms will be kept in the Site I nvestigator’s study files  as 
source document . 
 
4(h)(ii)( 2). Data Quality Assurance : DataFax, a clinical trial data management 
system (by [CONTACT_284205], Inc.), will be used for d ata collection and 
management. The study coordinators from the sites and the Independent Assessors will 
complete case report forms (CRFs) in paper and fax them directly to the DataFax 
computer server, where data images o f the CRFs are stored as files.  The system uses 
an optical character recogniti on (OCR) paradigm to automatically process and store the 
information from the image as data into the study database. The original fax image is 
also stored. Data management staff at Hines CSPCC will review each CRF by 
[CONTACT_141417]. Data 
management staff at Hines CSPCC will also review CRFs for protocol adherence , data 
consistency, and add data queries to items that fail these checks. Extensive data 
checks, including missing values, out -of range ent ries, and consistency between 
variables, both within and across forms, will be  performed manually and 
programmatically. On a regular basis, data management staff will produce site -specific 
Quality Control reports that list all unresolved data queries.  Dat a management staff will 
make the reports available to each site and work with the study coordinators and the 
Independent Assessors to help them resolve queries.  Queries will be resolved when 
the appropriate corrections to the CRF are made and data resent, or when an 
explanation is provided that allows for data management staff to resolve the query.  All 
corrections and changes to the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_141418].  In 
addition to the Quality Control report, Hines CSPCC may generate and distribute 
targeted data edit reports on an as -needed basis . The Hines CSPCC will monitor 
completeness and timeliness of the data discrepancy resolution made by [CONTACT_427753] . The Study Chair , the study  coordinators and 
Independent Assessors will receive periodic reports regarding the quality and quantity of 
data submi tted to the Hines CSPCC. Other quality control measures include periodic 
reports containing participant recruitment information and relevant medical data for 
review by [CONTACT_64362] .  The Hines CSPCC will also prepare summary reports for the 
Study Chair , the Data Monitoring Committee, and other monitoring groups of the data to 
track progress, and conduct final analyses of the study data. Study reports will be 
generated using DataFax, SAS, and other tools (e.g., Microsoft Excel and Access).  
SAS and other statistical software packages will be used to conduct data analysis for 
the study.  The Hines CSPCC is using SAS Version 9.3 in 201 4 and will upgrade to 
newer versions once they are purchased and validated . 
 
4(h)(ii)( 3) Data Confidentiality and Data Securi ty: Handling and storage of study 
data will adhere to current VA policies. The analytical database will not contain 
information that can directly identify the study participant  (such as name, address, etc .); 
however it will not be a completely de -identified database since age and study visit 
dates will be collected. The Hines CSPCC requires that a copy of the signed consent 
form and a participant  contact [CONTACT_427754]. The consent form is  
required by [CONTACT_427755][INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/[ADDRESS_540563] sheets are collected in the event  study 
participants  need to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (such as for safety notices) after study sites have 
completed the study. Consent forms and participant  contact [CONTACT_427756]. All paper -based records, including source documents and 
paper case report forms, will be kept in locked file cabinets at the participating sites and 
Hines CSPCC . The servers housing the study databases will be located at a secure VA 
facility and housed behind the VA firewall on VA -owned and VA-maintained servers.   
The system will be monitored to ensure that all applicable VA regulations and directives 
are strictly followed . Access to the study data is restricted by [CONTACT_427757].  
Only CSP -approved individuals (such as: staff at the study site s, CSPCC, and CSP 
Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating Center [CSPCRPCC ]) will have access to the 
personal health information (PHI) of study participants . 
 
4(h)(ii)( 4). Site Perf ormance : Hines CSPCC evaluates recruitment and retention 
performance monthly. Other performance problems such as protocol deviations, poor 
data quality, missing or overdue data, and reasons for withdrawal from study will also be 
tracked. A monthly study co nference call for study personnel including Hines CSPCC, 
CSPCRPCC, Chair’s office, and all sites will be held to review study recruitment, data 
quality , and protocol adherence. Study sites will be put on probation for poor 
performance, including under -recruitment. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_427719], at which time the site may be taken off probation, have probation continued , or 
have funding stopped, depending on its performance during the probationary period. 
The Hines CSPCC Director is autho rized to make these decisions.  
 
4(h)(iii) . Study Monitoring : The groups charged with centrally monitoring the 
various aspects of the study will be the Executive Committee (EC) and Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC). Both committees meet at study start -up and annually thereafter. The 
EC will also have quarterly conference calls. The DMC may elect to meet more 
frequently if it deems it necessary.  
The Executi ve Committee is the management and decision -making group for the 
operational aspects of the study. One of its major responsibilities is to monitor the 
performance of the participating medical centers. The EC considers the need for 
protocol modifications. T he Executive Committee also reviews and approves all 
manuscripts and abstracts emanating from the study. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_427720]. It is chaired by [CONTACT_64362] . 
The Study Group, which consists of all participating investigators and site clinical 
research personnel, will meet annually to discuss the progress of the study and any 
problems encountered during the conduct of the trial. Study personnel will adhere to 
Office of Research  & Development (ORD)  policy on human subjects’ protections by [CONTACT_427758] (GCP) training per VHA Handbook 
1200.05. Completed training certificates will be provided by [CONTACT_427759] . SMART (Site Monitoring, Auditing, and 
Resource Team), a division of the CSP Clinical Research Pharmacy Coordinating 
Center  (CSPCRPCC) , may conduct a full audit of participating sites if requested by [CONTACT_427760][INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 33 of the monitoring bodies.  The study will be monitored utilizing centralized data and 
statistical monitoring methods and remote -based source verification; which will be 
based on risk assessment and management strategies.  
The Data Monitoring Committee will review the progress of the study, including 
patient intake, completeness of follow -up, data quality, protocol deviations , and safety. 
The DMC may also choose to implement a formal interim monitoring rule to monitor 
efficacy. The DMC will review any protocol modifications recommended by [CONTACT_1383]. The 
DMC will establish criteria for study termination and make recommendations to the 
Director, CSR&D , through the Director, Hines CSPCC , as to whether the study should 
continue , be put on probation,  or be terminated. Interim unblinded progress reports will 
be provided to the DMC by [CONTACT_15282].  This study has been assigned to a 
central DMC organized and managed by [CONTACT_427761] (CSR&D). The membership of DMC is approved by [CONTACT_427762]&D 
Director and has no direct rela tionship to any facility, study or investigator. The DMC 
has about [ADDRESS_540564] be reviewed annually by [CONTACT_126259] 
R&D Committee and IRB at each site in order for that site to participate in the study.  
 
4(h)(iv) . Study Performance Benchmarks : Study benchmark dates will be 
determined upon successful funding of the study. H owever, the following timelines will 
serve as a reference:  
(1). Enrol lment of four VA sites: Dallas VA, and 3 other VA  sites 
(2). Study site IRB submission and approval: four months  
(3). Study sample transportation and storage arrangements and contract:  
two months  
(4). Recruitment of ACS patients/month/site: one and a half  
(5). Study site s recruitment/year: 72 
(6). Subject follow -up and follow -up study blood sampling: 80% 
(7). Lost to follow -up: < 20% 
 
 
4(i) Human Subjects : 
1. Human subject involvement and characteristics: As the study proposes to enroll 
ACS patients, strict enrollment criteria will be used to select eligible patients.  
 
2. Sources of material : The source of material will be information obtained during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], procedure logs, and laboratory values and tests. The laboratory 
values and test s will include research laboratory and patient relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427721]. LDL -apheresis data will be collected by [CONTACT_427763]. Patients’ names will not be divulged , and all data will be 
coded in the study records. The investigators will only use information gained 
 
PREMIER Pi[INVESTIGATOR_427697] 2.4 – 06/22/16  Page 34 during the study for the evaluation of study results. The copi[INVESTIGATOR_427722] s will be kept on file  by [CONTACT_6962] s, and no patient 
names or other identifying data will be used in future publications. All files will be 
secured in a locked filing cabinet in a locked office.  
 
3. Informed consent: The site investigators or the site study coordinator s will 
interview and explain the details of the study to all potential subjects, who will be 
subsequently asked to sign an IRB -approved informed consent form  prior to any 
study procedure .  
 
4. Provisions for managing adverse reactions : Only trained and accred ited 
personnel will be performing PCI, IVUS, LDL -apheresis, peripheral blood 
sampling , and laboratory handling of specimens. Cardiac catheterization will be 
performed using standard clinical protocol, and all patients will be observed 
closely in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a fter the procedure and discharge d when clinically indicated. 
Consented p atients with a complicated PCI procedure  will be excluded from 
participating in the study, but will be monitored for AEs/SAEs , and the safety data 
will be reported to the study safety and oversight committee s. However, 
randomized patients with post -PCI complications will still be followed unless 
otherwise terminated from the study, performed as many assessments as 
possible, and included in the final analyses.  Intensive patient follow -up protocol 
has already been described in Table 1 . Patients will undergo LDL -apheresis 
using peripheral IV access  exclusively . No more than two patients will be enrolled 
and will undergo LDL -apheresis on a given day at a center. The study will be 
terminated if recommended by [CONTACT_427764].  
 
5. Potential benefit to subjects and others: All patients will be treated and followed 
following an ACS and will receive more intensive pharmacologic hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_427723]. 
Patients will also be reimbursed $50.00 for participation in the study, $50.00 for 
the 90 -day follow -up visit, and $ 40.00 for each of the other follow -up visit s to 
improve compliance and attainment of National Cholesterol Education Program 
(NCEP) and the latest ACC/AHA Lipid Lowering Therapy  guidelines. The 
information obtained from this study could certainly develop as a viable strategy 
for our veterans. Successful completion of this study with acquired necessary 
experience may lead to development of this treatment strategy at one of the 
largest VAMC s in the nation.  
 
6. Importance of the knowledge gained: The results of this study , apart from 
providing VP stabilization information from intensive LDL lowering , will principally 
advance the field of coronary atherosclerosis and VP healing.  
 
 
4(j) Publication Policies and Planned Manuscripts

other related facts will be presented for informational (not recruitment) purposes on the 
Cooperative Studies Program website at www.research.va.gov/programs/csp/ccta0002 . 
Only general information will be provided without any participant -specific references. 
The Executive Committee will approve all topi[INVESTIGATOR_427724] n or publication. It will 
review and approve all manuscripts and abstracts prior to submission. The Director, 
Hines CSPCC , must also approve every manuscript and abstract prior to publication.  
 
 
4(k) Resources  
All work including LDL -apheresis will be conducted on the premises of four study 
sites except that the EPC cell culture analysis will be  done only at the Dallas VAMC : 
 
1. Cardiac catheterization and PCI/IVUS -VH will be performed in the cardiac 
catheterization  laboratory of the Dallas VAMC and other VA sites.  
 
2. Laboratory analysis of EPC by [CONTACT_427765] [INVESTIGATOR_427725]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_427726] a 
dedicated laboratory space, which currently in cludes 850 sq ft of laboratory 
space, 200 sq ft of office space, and shared 400 sq ft dedicated to cell culture 
facility. The same building houses common -use instruments such as 
ultracentrifuges ; inverted dual laser confocal microscope ( Zeiss); inverted

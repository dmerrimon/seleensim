Amendement 1, Clinical Study Protocol 
12 April 2018 Note : the test article must be manufactured compliant to cGMP and meet the proposed 
ANDA  specifications . 
Duration of treatment: 42 days  (6 weeks) after start of administration of study drug  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  
Brinzolamide (AZOPT ®) 1% Ophthalmic Suspension  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  The primary endpoint is the mean difference  in IOP of both eyes  between the two treatment 
groups at four time points, eg, at approximately 8:00 a.m. (hour 0; before the morning drop) and 10:00 
a.m. (hour 2) at the Day 14 (week 2 ) and Day 42 (week 6) visits .  
 
Safety:  The safety and tolerabi lity of the generic brinzolamide 1% suspe nsion and brinzolamide 1% 
suspension (AZOPT®) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_703277],  ophthalmic exams 
(BCVA, refraction, biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy), and monitoring  of treatment related adverse 
events.  
Statistical methods:  A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized and approved  
prior to the  unmasking of the trial.  
The primary endpoint is the mean difference in IOP of both eyes between the two treatment groups at 
four time points, eg, at approximately 8:00 a.m. (hour 0; before the morning drop) and 10:00 a.m. (hour 
2) at the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 (week 6) visits. The endpoint will be analyzed using the per -
protocol population, which will include all randomized subjects who meet all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, instilled 75% to 125% of the planned doses for the entire duration of the study, as verified by 
[CONTACT_287467], and who did not miss the scheduled applications for more than [ADDRESS_954787] eted evaluations at Day 14 and Day 42 within the designated visit window (± 4 days) with no 
protocol deviations  that would affect the treatment evaluation.  
In order to establish equivalence of the two treatments:  
1. The limits of each two -sided 95% CI of the treatment difference (test – reference) for mean IOP 
of both eyes (continuous variable) at all four follow -up points ( eg, at approximately 8:00 AM 
(hour 0; before the morning drop) and 10:00 AM (hour 2) at the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 
(week 6) visits mus t be within ± 1.5 mm Hg; and  
2. For the majority of the time points [3 out of 4 follow -up time points; eg, at approximately 8:00 
AM (hour 0; before the morning drop) and 10:00 AM (hour 2) at the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 
42 (week 6) visits) measured], the limit s of each two -sided 95% CI of the difference s in the 
mean IOP of both eyes between the two treatment groups is within ± 1.0 mmHg  
The point estimates of the difference between the two treatment groups and the two -sided 95% CIs will 
be presented. Since both of the above conditions have to be satisfied to establish equivalence, the type I 
error (α), will not be adjusted to account for multiple comparisons.  
The safety and tolerability of the generic brinzolamide 1% suspension and brinzolamide 1% suspension 
(AZO PT®) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_703277], ophthalmic exams (BCVA, 
refraction, biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy), and monitoring of adverse events.  
Sample size calculations:  
A mean treatment difference of [ADDRESS_954788] deviati on of 3. 3 mmHg, and a  correlation 
coefficient of 0. 565 between any 2 different follow -up time points was assumed for  the sample size 
calculation. To confirm the lower and the upper bounds of the two-sided 95% confidence  interval (CI) of 
the treatment diffe rence is within the range of ± 1.[ADDRESS_954789] 3 (out  of 4) follow -up time points 
(at approximately 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM on days 14 and 42), and to confirm that the lower and the 
upper bounds of the two -sided 95% CI of the treatment difference at all  4 follow -up time points are 
within ±1.5 mmHg,  a minimum number of 280 evaluable  patients for each treatment group will be 
needed to  achieve 90% power. To account for 10% attrition, a total of 624 subjects (312 subjects  per 
group)  will need to be randomize d.

Amendement 1, Clinical Study Protocol 
12 April 2018 5 Introduction 
Mechanism of Action 
Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrous inhibitor indicated for the reduction of intraocular 
pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular 
hypertension (OH). 
Background and Rationale 
Brinzolamide belongs to a class of heterocyclic sulfonamide carbonic anhydrous inhibitors 
(CA
Is) that is topi[INVESTIGATOR_703257]. It has high affinity and inhibitory potency 
against human CA II, an isoenzyme of carbonic anhydrase found in the ciliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603], 
which are involved with aqueous humor secretion. Branded brinzolamide is formulated as an 
ophthalmi
c 1% aqueous suspension with a physiologic pH ( AZOPT ®). AZOPT® is well 
tolerated and does not produce many of the side effects associated with the CAIs that are 
given systemically, making it an attractive treatment for patients with glaucoma, in whom 
compliance with therapy can be an issue. It reduces IOP from baseline in a statistically 
significant and clinically relevant manner in the majority of patients when used for primary 
or adjunctive therapy (Sall K. 2000) ( S hin D. 2000 ). 
Complete information for this compound may be found in the single reference safety 
doc
ument (SRSD), which for this study is the (AZOPT®) [LOCATION_002] Package Insert 
(U
SPI, version date 07/2015). 
Clin
ical Studies 
The safety and efficacy of brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension have been evaluated in 
several previous clinical studies (reference to Section 20). 
I
n two, three-month clinical studies, brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension in subjects with 
e
levated IOP, produced significant reductions in IOP (4-5 mmHg) ( S all K. 2000 ) (Silver LH. 
1998 ). These IOP reductions were statistically equivalent (confidence limit less than 1.5 
mmHg) to the reductions observed with dorzolamide 2% hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 
(Sall K. 2000) ( March WF, Ochsner KI 2000 ). The studies also demonstrated that

than dorzolamide ( S all K. 2000) ( S ilver LH. 1998 ). 
In a double masked, randomized, adjunctive study, 108 patients received brinzolamide 1% or 
placebo in addition to ocular timolol 0.5% for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or 
ocular hypertension (OH). Adding topi[INVESTIGATOR_703258]. Over the 3-month study, IOP changes ranged from -3.3 mmHg to -4.1 mmHg 
in the brinzolamide group compared to -0.9 mmHg to -2.5 mmHg in the placebo group (p 
<0.03, brinzolamide vs. placebo) ( Shin D. 2000 ). 
In a long-term study, brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension induced significant IOP 
reductions and caused less ocular discomfort than topi[INVESTIGATOR_328202] 0.5%, in patients with 
open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or OH ( March WF, Ochsner KI 2000 ). Patients treated with 
timolol attained a significantly greater mean reduction of 5.2 mmHg in IOP compared with 
patients receiving brinzolamide (p <0.0002). There were no significant adverse events 
(March WF, Ochsner KI 2000 ). 
In a 12 week InnoPharma/[COMPANY_007] (previous sponsor) bioequivalence study of the generic 
brinz
olamide 1% suspension and brinzolamide 1% suspension (AZOPT®) in 256 patients 
with P
OAG or OH, the 95% confidence limits on the mean difference in IOP between 
treatment groups were within 1.5 mmHg at each time point with comparable safety and 
tolerance ( InnoPharma Inc. 2012 ).  
This repeat study will be prospective, randomized, double masked and will follow Food and 
Drug Administration ( FDA ) guidance for demonstrating bioequivalence of the generic 
brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension (test article) compared to brinzolamide 1% 
ophthalmi
c suspension (AZOPT®; reference listed drug, reference article) to treat elevated  
I
OP in patients with POAG or OH. 
6 Study Objectives and Endpoints 
6.1 Primary objective

8.[ADDRESS_954811] Withdrawal Criteria 
Withdrawal of consent: Subjects who wish to discontinue study treatment will remain in the 
study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The 
only exception to this is when the subject specifically withdraws consent for any further 
contact [CONTACT_703279]. Subjects are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw at any 
time, without giving a reason. The withdraw al of consent should be explained in detail in the 
medic
al records of the investigator, as to whether the withdraw al is only from further 
treatment of investigational product or also from study procedures and/or post treatment 
study follow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital st atus 
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information 
should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with 
local law. 
 
For subjects that are lost to follow-up, all reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects 
to dete
rmine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow-up with persons authorized 
by [CONTACT_74084]. Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to 
contact [CONTACT_423], schedule a final study visit, obtain as much follow-up data as possible, 
and to retrieve all study materials. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s 
medic
al records. If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use permissible

re
presentative to assist in the follow-up portion of the study has been included in the 
subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor-retained third-party 
representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_61860]-up portion of the study. The site 
staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact [CONTACT_3031]. If, after all attempts, 
the subject remains lost to follow-up, then the last-known-alive date as determined by [CONTACT_703280]’s medical records.  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety or behavioral 
reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study 
visits or procedures at a given study site. 
 
Subjects whose condition worsens ( eg, IOP 36 mmHg in either eye) and require alternate or 
supplemental therapy for the treatment of their primary open angle glaucoma or ocular 
h
ypertension during the study should be discontinued from the study, excluded from the per-
pr
otocol population analysis, and provided with effective treatment. 
 
If
 a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_1560]. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_8873]’s medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should 
be
 made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the 
re
ason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s) , 
re
quest that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved AEs. Where possible, the same assessments as Day 42 ( S ection 
(11.1.5), should be completed if the subject withdraws from the study early. If the subject 
withdra
ws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, 
no f

For the purpose of this study, and per International Conference on harmonization (ICH) 
guidelines investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient 
or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical trial, including a product with a 
marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different 
from the approved form, or when used to gain further information about an approved use 
(ICH E6 1.33). 
9.1.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects who meet all inclusive/exclusive criteria will be randomized to receive the generic

9.5 Protocol Deviations  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_1275]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual patients or a small group of 
patients and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.  
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the patients’ source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a 
deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the

At the time of receipt of the investigational product by [CONTACT_8647], the sponsor will 
specify the appropriate number of containers or units to select for retention by [CONTACT_1275]. The total amounts of reserve samples will, at a minimum, be equivalent to five 
ti
mes the quantity of investigational product (test product and reference product) required for 
re
lease testing. The total amount of reserve samples will be divided among all study sites 
pa
rticipating in this study. The number of retain samples per site is subject to change, if the 
tot
al number of sites change. 
 
The sponsor will also specify the conditions of sample storage, the required duration of 
sample retention and the provisions for returning the investigational product. When retention 
samples are selected, containers or units should be placed in packaging with a tamper evident 
se
al. The packaging should be clearly identified as to its content (that it contains retention 
sa
mples) and the investigational product should be stored in a restricted area with limited 
a
ccess. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_954819], will ensure that all 
investigational products, including any comparator and/or marketed products, are stored in a 
secured area with controlled access under required storage conditions in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements. 
All investigational product must be stored at 4º to 30ºC (39-86 ºF) in accordance with the 
c
onditions specified on the study label. The storage location at the clinical site must have 
limited access, available to study site personnel only. Subjects must be instructed regarding 
proper storage. Investigational product should be stored in its original container and in 
a
ccordance with the label.  
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products) for business 
da
ys only. This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt

ensures active daily evaluation for excursions should be available. The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, 
shoul
d be regularly inspected to ensure it is maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the investigational product label storage conditions should be reported 
upon discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the investigational 
product to the storage conditions as described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations 
from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and 
reported to the sponsor. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be 
quarantined and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the 
investigational product.  
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be 
provided to the site.  
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the investigational product is briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling 
are not considered excursions. More specific details will be provided to the sites separately in 
an investigational product manual or equivalent, including storage conditions and actions to 
be taken when conditions are outside the specified range. 
Investigational site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take 
home investigational products. 
Retention samples of investigational product will be stored in accordance with Sponsor 
procedures and FDA regulations.

 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions); 
 R esults in congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize 
the subject, or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the

Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
A serious injury that can cause a serious deterioration in state of health can include:

subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above. 
12.3 Causality Assessment 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
se
rious) Related or Not Related to the study drug; the investigator must record the causal 
re
lationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the 
SAE reporting requirements if applicable. An investigator’s causality assessment is the 
determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product 
caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided.  The following should be taken into account when 
a
ssessing SAE causality: 
 P ositive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was withdrawn 
and the SAE resolved or the event recurred after re introduction.  
 If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or 
concomitant illness.  
 P ossible association with previous or concomitant therapy.  
 No te mporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology 
exists.  
 I f the AE is directly related to study procedures or there is a lack of efficacy.

then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, 
as defined by [CONTACT_456] (see the section on Reporting Requirements).  
 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.

available autopsy findings should be submitted as soon as possible.  
12.6.2 Non-serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AE CRF. Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms. AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information. 
12.6.3 Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be carried out in 
accordance with applicable local regulations.

before data unmasking.  
13.1 Sample Size Determination 
The sample size was determined to assess the bioequivalence of the generic brinzolamide 1% 
suspension compare
d to brinzolamide 1% suspension (AZOPT®) in patients with primary 
open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Based on the IOP lowering effect of the generic 
br
inzolamide 1% suspension and brinzolamide 1% suspension (AZOPT®) observed in the 
previous study performed by [CONTACT_703287],[ADDRESS_954858] deviation of 3.3 mmHg and a correlation coefficient of 0.565 between any 2 
diff
erent follow-up time points was assumed for the sample size calculation. To confirm the 
lower and the upper bounds of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment 
diff
erence are within the range of ±1.[ADDRESS_954859] 3 (out of 4) follow-up time points 
(at approximately 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM on days 14 and 42), and to confirm that the lower 
and the upper bounds of the two -sided 95% CI of the treatment difference at all 4 follow-up 
time points are within ±1.5 mmHg, a minimum number of 280 evaluable subjects for each 
tre
atment group will be needed to achieve 90% power. To account for 10% attrition, a total 
of
 624 subjects (312 per group) will need to be randomized.  
13.2
 Efficacy Analysis  
13.2.1 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the mean difference in IOP of both eyes between the two treatment 
g
roups at four time points, eg, at approximately 8:00 a.m. (hour 0; before the morning drop) 
and 10:00 a.m. (hour 2) at the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 (week 6) visits. The endpoint will 
be analyzed using the per-protocol population, which will include all randomized subjects 
who me
et all inclusion/exclusion criteria, instilled 75% to 125% of the planned doses for the 
entire duration of the study, as verified by [CONTACT_287467], and who did not miss the scheduled 
applications for more than 3 consecutive days, and completed evaluations at Day 14 and Day

a
ffect the treatment evaluation. 
 
In addition to the deviations described in the previous paragraph, the following protocol 
deviations will be considered important and will result in exclusion from the per-protocol 
population. 
 Use  of the wrong treatment ( eg, misrandomization) 
 Use  of prohibited prescription and over-the-counter drug products, procedures, and 
activities as outlined in Section 9.3 
 R aised IOP requiring treatment, defined as subjects whose condition worsens ( eg, 
IOP 36 mmHg in either eye) and who require alternate or supplemental therapy for 
the tr
eatment of their primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension during the 
stud
y 
 Additi onal criteria may be added prior to unmasking of the treatment assignments 
 
In order to establish equivalence of the two treatments: 
 
1. The  limits of each two-sided 95% CI of the treatment difference (test – reference) for 
mea
n IOP of both eyes (continuous variable) at all four follow-up points [( eg, at 
approximately 8:00 AM (hour 0; before the morning drop) and 10:00 AM (hour 2) at 
the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 (week 6) visits] must be within ± 1.5 mm Hg; and 
 
2. F or the majority of the time points [3 out of 4 follow-up time points; eg, a t 
approximately 8:00 AM (hour 0; before the morning drop) and 10:00 AM (hour 2) at

sided 95%
 CI of the difference in the mean IOP of both eyes between the two 
treatment groups must be within ± 1.0 mmHg 
 
The
 point estimates of the differences between the two treatment groups and the two-sided

13.3 Safety Analysis 
The safety and tolerability of the generic brinzolamide 1% suspension and brinzolamide 1% 
suspension (AZOPT®) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_703277], 
ophthalmic exams (BCVA, refraction, biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy), and monitoring 
of adverse events. 
 
The “Safety Analysis Set” will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study 
medication. Safety data will be summarized and presented in tabular and/or graphical format. 
 
I
n addition to standard safety displays, a 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs. 
Under this approach, AEs are classified into [ADDRESS_954860] their safety data included in the tiered analysis below. There are no Tier-1 events 
for this study; only Tier-2 and Tier-3 events will be reported.

           FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 
1 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE 
AZOPT† (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor indicated 
in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is one drop of AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% in the 
affected eye(s) three times daily. AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% may be used concomitantly with other topi[INVESTIGATOR_703269]. If more than one topi[INVESTIGATOR_703270], the drugs should be administered at least ten (10) minutes apart. 
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Solution containing 10 mg/mL brinzolamide. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% is contraindicated in patients who are 
hypersensitive to any component of this product. 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Sulfonamide Hypersensitivity Reactions 
AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% is a sulfonamide and although administered 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_703271]. Therefore, the same types of adverse reactions that are attributable to sulfonamides may occur with topi[INVESTIGATOR_703272] (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%. Fatalities have occurred, although rarely, due to severe reactions to sulfonamides including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias. Sensitization may recur when a sulfonamide is re-administered irrespective of the route of administration. If signs of serious reactions or hypersensitivity occur, discontinue the use of this preparation. 
5.2 Corneal Endothelium 
Carbonic anhydrase activity has been observed in both the cytoplasm and around the plasma 
membranes of the corneal endothelium. There is an increased potential for developi[INVESTIGATOR_703273]. Caution should be used when prescribing AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% to this group of patients. 
5.3 Severe Renal Impairment 
AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% has not been studied in patients with severe 
renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Because AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% and its metabolite are excreted predominantly by [CONTACT_10521], AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% is not recommended in such patients. 
5.4 Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma 
The management of patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma requires therapeutic 
interventions in addition to ocular hypotensive agents. AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% has not been studied in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma.

The preservative in AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by [CONTACT_703291]. Contact [CONTACT_703292] (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%, but may be reinserted [ADDRESS_954878] the rates observed in practice. 
In clinical studies of AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%, the most frequently 
reported adverse reactions reported in 5 to 10% of patients were blurred vision and bitter, sour or unusual taste. Adverse reactions occurring in 1 to 5% of patients were blepharitis, dermatitis, dry eye, foreign body sensation, headache, hyperemia, ocular discharge, ocular discomfort, ocular keratitis, ocular pain, ocular pruritus and rhinitis. 
The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence below 1%: allergic reactions, 
alopecia, chest pain, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, diplopia, dizziness, dry mouth, dyspnea, dyspepsia, eye fatigue, hypertonia, keratoconjunctivitis, keratopathy, kidney pain, lid margin crusting or sticky sensation, nausea, pharyngitis, tearing and urticaria.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy Category C: Developmental toxicity studies with brinzolamide in rabbits at oral 
doses of 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg/day (20, 62, and 125 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) produced maternal toxicity at 6 mg/kg/day and a significant increase in the number of fetal variations, such as accessory skull bones, which was only slightly higher than the historic value at 1 and 6 mg/kg. In rats, statistically decreased body weights of fetuses from dams receiving oral doses of 18 mg/kg/day (375 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) during gestation were proportional to the reduced maternal weight gain, with no statistically significant effects on organ or tissue development. Increases in unossified sternebrae, reduced ossification of the skull, and unossified hyoid that occurred at 6 and 18 mg/kg were not statistically

            significant. No treatment-related malformations were seen. Following oral administration of 
14C-brinzolamide to pregnant rats, radioactivity was found to cross the placenta and was present in the fetal tissues and blood. 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. AZOPT (brinzolamide 
ophthalmic suspension) 1% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
8.3 Nursing Mothers 
In a study of brinzolamide in lactating rats, decreases in body weight gain in offspring at an oral 
dose of 15 mg/kg/day (312 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) were seen during lactation. No other effects were observed. However, following oral administration of 14C­brinzolamide to lactating rats, radioactivity was found in milk at concentrations below those in the blood and plasma. 
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in 
human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1%, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 
8.4 Pediatric Use 
A three-month controlled clinical study was conducted in which AZOPT (brinzolamide 
ophthalmic suspension) 1% was dosed only twice a day in pediatric patients 4 weeks to 5 years of age. Patients were not required to discontinue their IOP-lowering medication(s) until initiation of monotherapy with AZOPT. IOP-lowering efficacy was not demonstrated in this study in which the mean decrease in elevated IOP was between [ADDRESS_954881] been observed between elderly and 
younger patients. 
10 OVERDOSAGE Although no human data are available, electrolyte imbalance, development of an acidotic state, 
and possible nervous system effects may occur following oral administration of an overdose. Serum electrolyte levels (particularly potassium) and blood pH levels should be monitored.

Brinzolamide has a molecular weight of 383.5 and a melting point of about 131°C. It is a white 
powder, which is insoluble in water, very soluble in methanol and soluble in ethanol. 
AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% is supplied as a sterile, aqueous suspension of 
brinzolamide which has been formulated to be readily suspended and slow settling, following shaking. It has a pH of approximately 7.5 and an osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg. 
Each mL of AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% contains: Active ingredient: 
brinzolamide 10 mg. Preservative: Benzalkonium chloride 0.1 mg. Inactives: mannitol, 
carbomer 974P, tyloxapol, edetate disodium, sodium chloride, purified water, with hydrochloric 
acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. 
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It 
catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II), found primarily in red blood cells (RBCs), but also in other tissues. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by [CONTACT_703293]. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP). 
AZOPT (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% contains brinzolamide, an inhibitor of 
carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II). Following topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784], brinzolamide inhibits aqueous humor formation and reduces elevated intraocular pressure. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss. 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
Following topi[INVESTIGATOR_222784], brinzolamide is absorbed into the systemic circulation. 
Due to its affinity for CA-II, brinzolamide distributes extensively into the RBCs and exhibits a long half-life in whole blood (approximately 111 days). In humans, the metabolite N-desethyl brinzolamide is formed, which also binds to CA and accumulates in RBCs. This metabolite binds mainly to CA-I in the presence of brinzolamide. In plasma, both parent brinzolamide and N­desethyl brinzolamide concentrations are low and generally below assay quantitation limits (<10 ng/mL). Binding to plasma proteins is approximately 60%. Brinzolamide is eliminated predominantly in the urine as unchanged drug. N-Desethyl brinzolamide is also found in the urine along with lower concentrations of the N-desmethoxypropyl and O-desmethyl metabolites.

   An oral pharmacokinetic study was conducted in which healthy volunteers received 1 mg 
capsules of brinzolamide twice per day for up to 32 weeks. This regimen approximates the amount of drug delivered by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_703274] (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% dosed to both eyes three times per day and simulates systemic drug and metabolite concentrations similar to those achieved with long-term topi[INVESTIGATOR_567537]. RBC CA activity was measured to assess the degree of systemic CA inhibition. Brinzolamide saturation of RBC CA-II was achieved within 4 weeks (RBC concentrations of approximately 20 mcM). N-Desethyl brinzolamide accumulated in RBCs to steady-state within 20 to 28 weeks reaching concentrations ranging from 6 to30 mcM. The inhibition of CA-II activity at steady-state was approximately 70 to 75%, which is below the degree of inhibition expected to have a pharmacological effect on renal function or respi[INVESTIGATOR_493960]. 
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Brinzolamide caused urinary bladder tumors in female mice at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day and in 
male rats at oral doses of 8 mg/kg/day in 2 year studies. Brinzolamide was not carcinogenic in male mice or female rats dosed orally for up to 2 years. The carcinogenicity appears secondary to kidney and urinary bladder toxicity. These levels of exposure cannot be achieved with topi[INVESTIGATOR_703275]. The following tests for mutagenic potential were negative: (1) in vivo mouse micronucleus assay; (2) in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay; and (3) Ames E. coli test. The in vitro mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay was negative in the absence of 
activation, but positive in the presence of microsomal activation. In reproduction studies of brinzolamide in rats, there were no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive capacity of males or females at doses up to 18 mg/kg/day (375 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose). 
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In two, three-month clinical studies, AZOPT® (brinzolamide ophthalmic suspension) 1% dosed 
three times per day in patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), produced significant reductions in IOPs (4 to 5 mmHg). These IOP reductions are equivalent to the reductions observed with TRUSOPT* (dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) 2% dosed three times per day in the same studies. 
In two clinical studies in patients with elevated intraocular pressure, AZOPT (brinzolamide 
ophthalmic suspension) 1% was associated with less stinging and burning upon instillation than TRUSOPT* 2%.

Title of Study:  
A Phase 2, Open -Label , Single- Arm Study of Single -Dose Lead -In and Neoadjuvant Trilaciclib and 
Chemotherapy in Patients with Early -Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer  (TNBC)  
Study centers:  Approximately 10 centers  
Stud y period (years): Approximately [ADDRESS_890884] patient enrolled:  Q1 [ADDRESS_890885] patient enrolled: Q3 [ADDRESS_890886] patient completed: Q1 2023  
Objectives:  
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the immune -based mechanism of action of trilaciclib after a single -dose as measured by 
[CONTACT_660605] 8 positive (CD8+ ) tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TILs) /regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio in tumor tissue . 
Secondary objectives:  
To assess the pathologic complete response ( pCR) rate at the time of definitive surgery.  
To evaluate  the safety and tolerability of trilaciclib in combination with  standard neoadjuvant 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
Exploratory objectives:  
To characterize  the intratumor al immune profile  following trilaciclib .  
To evaluate  the kinetics of the peripheral immune response following trilaciclib . 
To identify molecular and cellular biomarkers in tumor or blood samples tha t may be indicative of 
clinical response/resistance, pharmacodynamic activity, and/or the mecha nism of action of trilaciclib 
and other systemic treatments. 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open -label, single -arm, neoadjuvant study with 4 phases: 1)  Screening 
Phase, 2) Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase, 3) Treatment Phase, and 4) Surgery and Follow-Up Phase.  
During the Screening Phase , tumor tissue (sample #1) will be obtained at baseline  prior to any study 
drug. This sample may be archival tissue, or if unavailable/insufficient, t hen a fresh biopsy is 
required . Patients with adequate archival tissue will also have the option to undergo an additional 
fresh biopsy at bas eline . Patients will receive a single dose of monotherapy trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 in 
the Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase, followed by [CONTACT_178523] (sample #2) 7 (±1) days later. Following the 
biopsy, patients will enter the Treatment Phase in which trilaciclib 240 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each cycle 
will be administered along with dose- dense anthracycline/cyclophosphamide followed by  [CONTACT_660606] (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 [AC] every 2 weeks 
for 4  cycles [ Cycles 1 -4], then weekly paclitaxel [T] 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 cycles [C ycles 5 -16]). If 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 5 pembrolizumab is given (per Investigator discretion), it will start wi th AC (Cycle 1 of chemotherapy). 
If carboplatin is given (per I nvestigator discretion) it will start with paclitaxel ( Cycle 5).   
Three to [ADDRESS_890887] dose of chemotherapy, patients will proceed to definitiv e surgery  at 
which time tumor tissue (sample #3) will be collected if the patient has residual disease . A 30-day 
Safety Follow -up Visit will occur 30 (+7) days after last dose of trilaciclib and an End of  Study Visit 
will occur within 14 days after surgery. Both the Safety Follow-up Visit and End of Study Visit may 
be conducted in person or by [CONTACT_660607] d may occur at the same visit .  
Methodology:  
Sample Size Justification:   
Sample size justification is based off of previously published data on t he CD8+/Treg ratio 
from early stage TNBC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. U sing a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 , and anticipating that 10% patients enrolled to this study 
will not have paired data (resulting in 27 patients with paired data), the power of the study 
to det ect a respective mean of paired difference in CD8 +/Tregs ratio  using  paired Wilcoxon 
signed- rank tests  has been calculated using PASS 2019 (v19.0.3) and is presented in the 
table below. 
 
Mean Change in CD8 +/Tregs  Power  
1.8 72% 
2.0 81% 
2.3 90% 
2.5 94% 
Based on the assumption of an estimated standard deviation of paired difference s of 3.4. 
 
Number of patients (planned ): Approximately 30 patients are planned to be enrolled in this study.  
Diagnosis and main eligibility criteria:  
Female p atients ≥[ADDRESS_890888] cancer in which neoadjuvant  chemotherapy with an anthracycline/taxane 
combination is deemed to be a suitable therapy and curative surgery i s intended. Documented 
diagnosis of TNBC (defined as <1% estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone r eceptor [PR] positive 
stained cells utilizing an assay consistent with local standards and HER2- negative as per 2018 
College of American Pathologists criteria ), a primary tumor ≥ 1.5 cm, and an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of [ADDRESS_890889] a dequate organ 
function as demonstrated by [CONTACT_660608] ≥50% or 
≥ institution lower  limit of normal  (LLN) . If the Investigator chooses to add pembrolizumab, there 
must be no active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past [ADDRESS_890890], dosage, and mode of administration: 
Trilaciclib will be administered as monotherapy as a single dose of 240 mg/m2 intravenously ( IV) 
over 30 minute s during the Trilaciclib L ead-In P hase of the study , and then at the same dose with 
each chemotherapy cycle  during the Treatment Phase .  
Duratio n of treatment: Study treatment will continue as per protocol to completion or early 
discontinuation of chemotherapy , until unacceptable toxicity, Investigator’s decision to withdraw the 
patient  from study treatment, pregnancy of the patient, noncompliance with study treatm ent or 
Protocol   G1T28-[ADDRESS_890891] of care c hemotherapy  backbone , dosage, and mode of administration:  
Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 will be administered IV once every 
2 weeks in Cycles 1 -4, followed by [CONTACT_114461] 80 mg/m2 administered IV once every week in 
Cycles  5-16.  
Treatment per Investigator discretion, dosage, and mode of administrati on: 
Carboplatin: If carboplatin is administered , the dose amount required will be calculated as area under 
the curve (AUC) at a dose level of AUC 1.5 weekly during paclitaxel treat ment (Cycle 5 -16). 
Carboplatin will be administered IV . 
Pembrolizumab: If pembrolizumab is administered, the dose level will b e 400 mg every 6 weeks 
starting with Cycle 1 of AC and continued while receiving chemotherapy. Pembrol izumab will be 
administered as an  IV infusion. 
Growth factor support:  
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)  should be administered after each cycle of AC 
chemotherapy or per Investigator discretion and as clinically indicated for subsequent cycles  with 
paclitaxel . G-CSF 5 μg/kg/d ay administered subcutaneously (SC) should be initiated at [ADDRESS_890892] 72 hours. Pegfilgrastim administered SC  as either a single dose of 
100 μg/kg (individualized) or a single dose of 6 mg (general approach) at 24 hours a fter 
chemotherapy is also acceptable.  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  pCR will be evaluated using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive re sidual in 
breast or nodes; residual noninvasive in breast allowed) as assessed by [CONTACT_660609].  
Safety: Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_12902] (AEs), clinical lab oratory test results 
(hematology and serum chemistry), and vital sign measurements (blood pressure  and pulse rate) as 
well as  electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and ejection fraction changes if clinically indicated.  
Statistical methods:   
Summary statistics will be used to summarize data collected from this stud y. The descriptive 
summary for the categorical variables will include counts and percentages. The de scriptive summary 
for the continuous variables will include means, standard deviations, medians , 25% and 75% 
percentiles, and minimum and maximum values. For the immune -response measures and other 
biomarkers, median will be used to present the central point of the populat ion being studied.   
Analysis population 
The Full Analysis Set - 1 (FAS1) population includes enrolled patients who have r eceived trilaciclib 
during the Trilaciclib Lead -in Phase. This dataset will be used to assess immune response in tumor 
tissue.  
The Full Analysis Set – 2 (FAS2) population includes enrolled patients who have received at least one  
dose of a study drug during the Treatment Phase of the study. This dataset will be use d to assess 
safety and tolerability and the rate of pCR for trilaciclib in combinati on with neoadjuvant systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
Statistical analysis method for primary and secondary efficacy endpoi nts 
Analysis for primary immune -response measure  
Summary statistics for primary immune -response measure, the ratio of CD8 + TIL over  Forkhead Box 
P3 (FOXP3 )+ regulatory T  cells (abbreviated as CD8 +/Tregs ), will be provided for measures taken at  
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 7 baseline ( pre-trilaciclib ), 7 ± 1 days after single dose trilaciclib ( post-trilaciclib ), and the change 
scores (post minus pre). Median will be used as the central point with Q1 and Q3 as the measure of 
spread. The significance of the magnitude of change will be tested by [CONTACT_660610]-Rank 
test. Analyses on the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS1 population. 
Analysis for pCR  
For the clinical efficacy endpoint, pCR rate will be reported with a 95% confide nce interval using the 
Clopper- Pearson method  based on FAS2 population. In addition, patients will be dichotomized by 
[CONTACT_660611]8 +/Tregs ratio, and pCR rate will be summarized by [CONTACT_660612]. The association between pCR status and high/low in ratio 
change will be tested using a Chi- square test. These analyses will be performed on the FAS2 
population.  
Analysis for sa fety endpoints 
For trilaciclib alone, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_660613] -in Phase 
based on FAS1 population. For trilaciclib in combination with other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , safety and 
tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], dose modification, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs based 
on FAS2 population. AEs are defined as those events occurring or worsening after  treatment has 
begun on this study. Collected AE terms  will be coded to system organ class and preferred term u sing 
the latest version of MedDRA. AEs will be graded according to the National C ancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.[ADDRESS_890893] OF

TIL tumor- infiltrating lymphocyte  
TIM3  T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain [ADDRESS_890902] cancer ( TNBC ) is a heterogeneous disease with distinct pathological, 
genetic, and clinical features,  and is associated with younger age and more advanced tumor stage 
at diagnosis, African American race/ethnicity, higher tumor grade, poor overall s urvival (OS), 
higher risk of disease recurrence, and higher recurrence in visceral organs within [ADDRESS_890903] cancer and 
human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2)- positive breast cancer , such as  endocrine 
therapy or HER2- targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g. , trastuzumab) , respectively, are not effective in TNBC,  
which lacks these markers . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (systemic therapy given prior to 
definitive surgery) with an anthracycline/taxane- based chemotherapy regimen (e.g., AC/T 
chemotherapy) has been considered an important and standard part of the treatment strategy for 
patients with early -stage  TNBC for both tumor control and improving the curability rate among 
subtypes ( NCCN , 2021 ; Cardoso, 2019 ).  
Alternative neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens such as those including carboplatin are  
available to patients with early -stage TNBC, however definite superiority of one regimen has not 
been demonstrated. The addition of carboplatin to paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting incre ased 
pathologic complete response (pCR) rates ( von Minckwitz, 2014; Sikov, 2015 ); however, the 
disease -free survival  (DFS) and OS effect with this treatment has not been confirmed and the 
addition of the platinum-based chemotherapy comes with additional toxicities. More re cently, 
agents that target immune checkpoint pathways, such as  the programmed cell death  protein 1 
(PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 ( PD-L1) pathway,  are in clinical development for TNBC, 
including in the neoadjuvant setting. Pembrolizumab is an ant i-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, that 
has been approved for use in patients with metastatic TNBC  with PD -L1 positive disease and 
recently for high-risk, early-stage TNBC in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuva nt 
treatment, and then continued as a single age nt as adjuvant treatment after surgery  (Keytruda® 
Prescribing Information, 2021 ). Results from the Phase [ADDRESS_890904] neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including 
carboplatin, led to improved pCR rates and a statistically significant event -free survival (EFS) 
compared with chemotherapy alone in high- risk, early -stage TNBC patients regardless of PD -L1 
status  (Schmid , 2020a ; [COMPANY_006] Press Release , 2021 ). Ultimately , the neoadjuvant regimen  
selected for the individual patient will depend on patient characteristics  and disease -specific  
factors.   
In summary, chemotherapy (with or without immunotherapy) remains the c ornerstone in treating 
TNBC. However, toxicity and eventual treatment resistance  are significant  impediments  to its 
success. Novel therapeutic options that can offer better anti -tumor efficacy without the 
associated high -grade toxicities are clearly needed  for th is patient population with high unmet 
medical need.  
4.1.1.  T Cell Activity and the Tumor Microenvironment  
The importance of  the types and crosstalk of immune cell populations within the tumor 
microenvironment and their impact on cancer progression has been clearly established . 
Accumulati ng evidence shows a correlation between tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes  (TILs)  in 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 18 tumor tissue and favorable clinical outcomes in various malignancies. In particular , the presence 
of cytotoxic cluster of differentiation 8 positive ( CD8 +) T cells and the rat io of cytotoxic CD8 + 
T cells to Forkhead Box P3 ( FOXP3 )+ regulatory T cells (Treg) correlates with improved 
prognosis and long- term survival in solid malignancies  (Vasievich , 2011 ; Gonzalez , 2018) . 
Another important factor in discerning the anti- tumor efficacy of the T cell s within the tumor 
microenvironment is their activation and functional potential based on their exhaustion st atus. T 
cell exhaustion is a stepwise loss in function that develops in the setting of chronic stimulation 
and in the presence of an immunosuppressive environment. Exhausted T cells upregulate 
expression of inhibitory receptors including but not limited to PD-1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte 
associated protein 4 ( CTLA -4), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 ( TIM3 ), T cell Ig 
and ITIM domain ( TIGIT ), and lymphocyte activation gene 3 ( LAG -3), and through interaction 
with its ligand inhibits T cell activation. Thus, the development  of therapeutic approaches that 
shift the tumor microenvironment to a more immune active environment is an active area of 
investigation , including in breast cancer . 
Relative to estrogen receptor ( ER)-positive /HER 2-negative breast cancer, TNBC tend s to have 
higher mutational burden and increased potential neo- antigenicity which results in immune 
stimulation . The immune microenvironment in breast carcinoma has been largely defined by [CONTACT_660614] , which are most pronounced in T NBC and HER2 -positive 
carcinomas  (Cimino -Mathews , 2015 ). TILs are emerging as promising prognostic and predictive 
biomarkers in breast cancer as demonstrated by [CONTACT_660615] 
(Denkert, 2010;  Ono, 2012;  Yamaguchi , 2012 ). Analysis of pre-treatment and post- treatment 
tumor specimens from breast cancer  patients showed a correlation between the development of 
TILs after neoadjuvant paclitaxel chemotherapy and clinical response ( Demaria , 2001 ). As noted 
for other tumor types, among TIL subsets in breast cancer , the presence of cytotoxic CD8 + 
T cells is favorable, whereas the presence of the immunosuppressive suppressor FOXP3+  Treg s 
is unfavorable. T here is  evidence that a high CD8+/ Treg  ratio after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
predicts OS and is associated with pCR ( Ladoire, 2011 ; Park, 2020 ). Collectively, these d ata 
suggest that immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660589] . 
Chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression and depletion of immune cells may also affect 
anti-tumor efficacy due to an inability of the host immune system to effectively mount a 
response against the cancer. Therefore, preserving the bone marrow and immune syste m from 
the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy has the potential to maximize the anti -tumor activity of the 
chemotherapy while minimizing myelotoxicity.  
4.2. Trilaci clib  
Trilaciclib is a highly potent and selective, reversible, cyclin-dependent kinase  (CDK) 4/6 
inhibitor that preserves hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) as well as immune 
system function during chemotherapy ( myeloprotection ) in addition to directly enhancing 
anti-tumor immunity (anti -cancer efficacy) (Figure 1 ). In February 2021, the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved trilaciclib (COSELA™) as a treatme nt to 
decrease the incidence of chemotherapy -induced myelosuppression in adult patients when 
administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing re gimen 
for extensive- stage small cell lung cancer (ES -SCLC).  
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 19 Both HSPC and lymphocyte proliferation  are dependent on CDK4/6 activity ( Kozar , 2004; 
Malumbres , 2004 ; Ramsey , 2007; Horsley , 2008 ) and become arrested in the gap  1 (G 1) phase of 
the cell cycle upon exposure to trilaciclib ( He, 2017a ). This trilaciclib -induced transient  cell 
cycle arrest has been demonstrated to provide res istance to chemotherapy -induced cell damage 
by [CONTACT_660616] T cell inhibition when 
combined with chemotherapy ( He, 2017b; Bisi, 2016 ; Lai, 2018; Sorrentino, 2017 ).  
Figure  1: Trilaciclib Transiently Arrests Normal Cells to Prevent Chemotherapy  
Induced Myelosuppression and Improve Anti -Tumor Efficacy

Chemotherapeutic agents may elicit part of their anti -tumor efficacy by [CONTACT_660617], uptake, and processing; prime the immune response  
through immunodepletion; inhibit regulatory cells; and stimulate immune effector cells 
(Zitvogel, 2008; McDonnell, 2011; Bracci , 2014 ). Conversely, immunosuppression from direct 
cytotoxicity to the bone marrow and immu ne system over repeated cycles of chemotherapy may 
counterbalance the positive immunostimulatory effects of chemotherapy. Therefor e, therapeutic 
approaches to maintain bone marrow health and immune system function should enhance the 
immune -mediated anti -tumor activity.  
Trilaciclib and other CDK4/[ADDRESS_890905] been shown to augment anti-tumor responses in 
nonclinical settings ( Klein , 2018 ) by [CONTACT_14377] T cell activa tion through the repression of 
nuclear factor of activated T  cell (NFAT) phosphorylation ( Deng , 2018 ), as well as increasing 
antigen presentation through upregulation of major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I 
and II in CDK4/6-sensitive tumors and myeloid cells ( Goel , 2017; Schaer , 2018 ). Additionally, 

Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 20 CDK4/6 inhibition can upregulate and stabilize the protein expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells  
(Zhang, 2018 ). Recently, nonclinical studies investigating CDK4/6 inhibitors in the 
differentiation of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells revealed a preferential skewing, of CDK4/6 inhibitor 
exposed cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, into memory precursor cells ( Heckler , 2021) . When these cells 
were transferred into mice, the CDK4/6 inhibitor exposed cytotoxic CD8 + T cells demonstrated 
durability and persistence. Importantly, mice administered with the CDK4/[ADDRESS_890906] of CDK4/6 inhibition on immune cell activation and 
differentiation, thereby [CONTACT_660618] l 
effects of trilaciclib on the generation of an anti-tumor responses. 
4.2.1.  Clinical Data with Trilaciclib  in TNBC  
The use of trilaciclib for patients with  TNBC was evaluated in Study G1T28 -04, a global, 
multicenter, randomized, open- label, Phase 2 clinical study to evalu ate the safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) of trilaciclib administered prior to  gemcitabine /carboplatin (GC) therapy 
in patients with locally recurrent/metastatic TNBC  who had previously been treated with 0 to 
2 lines of therapy in the metastatic setting . Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of two 
different trilaciclib +  GC treatment regimens or GC alone. Based on its mechanism of action 
(MOA), it was hypothesized that trilaciclib administered before chemotherapy could protect the 
bone marrow from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, while also enhancing immune activity 
in patients with TNBC , thus potentially improving both safety and anti -tumor activity. 
Additionally, TNBC is considered genomically unstable and the tumor microenvironment is 
moderately immunogenic ( Park, 2018 ); a state that could be potentially enhanced by [CONTACT_660619], leading to improved anti- tumor activity.  
The G1T28-[ADDRESS_890907] evaluation of trilaciclib in a tumor type other than small cell 
lung cancer ( SCLC ), where trilaciclib development has focused on myeloprotection benefits  
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). In contrast to previously observed SCLC results, the addition of trilaciclib t o 
chemotherapy for patients with TNBC in G1T28- 04 did not result in statistically significant 
improvements in myeloprotection endpoints, but instead resulted in a substantial improvement in 
anti-tumor efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_660620]-tumor efficacy en dpoints including OS (median 
OS duration in control: 12.6 months vs. not evaluable or 17.8 months in the two trilaciclib 
groups; described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). Efficacy was demonstrated  across patient subgroups, 
including patients with PD-L1 positive and negative tumors and those with different CDK4/6 
dependence signatures  using two established assays (Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene 
Signature [CONTACT_45040] [PAM50] and Lehmann triple- negative breast cancer type ) (Prat, 2014; 
Lehmann , 2016; Asghar , 2017 ). These  data suggest trilaciclib does not antagonize chemotherapy 
efficacy irrespective of CDK4/6 status, TNBC is predominantly CDK4/6 independent, and 
therefore not sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition ( Tan, 2019 ; data on file). 
Evaluation of patient -reported outcomes ( PROs ) by [CONTACT_423069] – Anemia and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast  (FACT -B) indicated 
that patients treated with trilaciclib were less likely to have a deterioration in their s ymptoms, 
and in some cases had improvement in their symptoms, through the first 6 cycles of therapy; and 
that trilaciclib delayed deterioration of patient functioning and  symptoms measures over time 
compared with GC alone. 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 21 4.2.2.  T Cell Activity with Trilaciclib  
Nonclinical data demonstrate that trilaciclib enhances immune activation and promotes  
anti-tumor immunity by [CONTACT_660621] T cell subset s followed 
by a faster recovery of cytotoxic T lymphocytes than Tregs  in tumor ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). To 
evaluate the effect of trilaciclib on T cell expansion in G1T28-04, T cell receptor  was 
longitudinally sequenced from the peripheral blood. Simpson clonality significantly decre ased 
over time in patients that received trilaciclib in addition to GC when compared to GC alone 
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_660590] =0.012) meaning that patients receiving trilaciclib and GC demonstrated T cell 
diversity based on increased n umbers of T cell clones . Furthermore, when patients were stratified 
above or below median Simpson clonality at baseline, there was a trend for improved OS among 
patients with decreased peripheral clonality and a  statistically significant improvement in OS  
among patients receiving trilaciclib (P =0.02) ( O’Shaughnessy, 2020 ). In addition to a decrease in 
Simpson clonality, responders receiving trilaciclib prior to GC had more newly detect ed 
expanded clones compared with responders receiving GC alone (P=0.09 ; data on file ). These 
data are consistent with the analys es of patient peripheral T cells from another clinical study 
(G1T28-02 ; NCT 02499770) demonstrating that transient exposure of trilaciclib in patients with 
SCLC during chemotherapy treatment both prese rved and increased peripheral lymphocyte 
counts and enhanced T cell activation  (Lai, 2020 ). Other immune activating effects of CDK4/[ADDRESS_890908] been demonstrated, including increasing antigen presentation through MHC 
class  I, decreasing T cell exhaustion markers (e.g., PD-1, CTLA -4, and T IM3), stabilizing 
expression of PD- L1 on tumor cells, and increasing T cell effector function through high 
interferon ( IFN)γ production. Collectively, t hese data provide insight into the variety of 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_660622]  T cell immunity leading to an anti-tumor efficacy . In 
addition, nonclinical studies have suggested the re is synergy between inhibition of CDK4/6 and 
anti-PD-1 blocking antibodies in multiple tumor models  (Chaikovsky and Sage, 2018; 
Deng , 2018; Goel , 2017; Schaer , 2018; Lai, 2020; Bonelli, 2019 ; Teh and Aplin, 2019 ). Clinical 
data in SCLC  demonstrated that the addition of trilaciclib prior to chemotherapy and the PD- L1 
antibody, atezolizumab , generated more newly expanded T cell clones  with significantly greater 
expansion among patients with clinical  response vs placebo  (Daniel , 2020 ). Treatment with 
CDK4/6 inhibitors may increase the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade ther api[INVESTIGATOR_660591] ( ICI) treatment .  
4.3. Study Rationale  
This study is designed to elucidate the immune- based  MOA  of trilaciclib  independent of other 
treatments in a neoadjuvant setting of TNBC. Nonclinical and recent clinical studies with 
trilaciclib demonstrate  enhanced  immune activation and anti- tumor immunity through 
differentially arresting cytotoxic and regulatory T cell subsets followed by a fa ster recovery of 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes than Tregs  in tumors. This differential alteration of cell cycle kinetics 
between cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Tregs  results in a higher proportion of cytotoxic 
T lymphocytes than Tregs , enhancement of T  cell activation, and a decrease in Treg -mediated 
immunosuppressive functions. Based on these anti -neoplastic driven effect s on the immune 
response, the study is designed to define quantitative and qualitative changes in immune cell  
phenotype and function following neoadjuvant trilaciclib treatment. These include  a 
measurement  of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell infiltration  into the tumor microenvironment following a 
single dose of trilaciclib and  changes in ratio of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to Tregs . Together, these 
Protocol   G1T28-[ADDRESS_890909] of T ce lls 
(protecting them from chemotherapy-induced damage), followed by [CONTACT_660623] 
T lymphocytes in the context of fewer Tregs .  
To evaluate the impact of trilacic lib on changes of the tumor-associated immune response in 
TNBC  treated with standard of care ( SOC ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy (plus carboplatin and/or 
pembrolizumab per Investigator discretion), immunophenotypic changes will be compared in 
tumor biopsies at baseline, after a single dose of monotherapy trilaciclib, and at definitive 
surgery  (if available) . Serial peripheral blood collection will also be obtained in parallel with 
tumor sample collection to identify immune correlates associated with trilaciclib treatme nt. For 
peripheral blood, an extra timepoint will be collected  prior to C ycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1) to d efine  the 
kinetics of the immune response following trilaciclib  plus chemotherapy. Longitudinal analysis 
after trilaciclib  treatment  will enable comprehensive assessment  of the immune and 
anti-neoplastic MOA  of trilaciclib  with potential  to identify biomarkers for patient selection in 
future studies and understand mechanisms of resistance . 
Finally, flexibility was built into the protoc ol to allow the Investigator to tailor  neoadjuvant 
therapy to each patient. As the treatment paradigm for early -stage TNBC continues to evolve, 
platinum chemotherapy and immunotherapy may be added  per Investigator discretion to the 
standard anthracycline/taxane-backbone. This inclusion will also  provide additional safety and 
efficacy data  for a novel combination .  
4.4. Background  
4.4.1.  Summary of Nonclinical Data 
A brief summary of the trilaciclib nonclinical data is provided in the following sections. Detailed 
information is presented in the Trilaciclib Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
Nonclinical data related to  chemotherapy  agents  (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel , 
and carboplatin) and immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) are provided in the US prescribing 
information  for each agent . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacology Studies 
Through a structure-based design approach to optimize potency, selectivity, and drug 
metabolism and PK properties, G1 Therapeutics, Inc. identifie d trilaciclib as a highly potent 
inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 (half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 1 nM and 4 nM, 
respectively) that is highly selective for CDK4/Cyclin D1 versus CDK2/Cyclin E ( >2500-fold 
selectivity). Trilaciclib also demonstrat ed reversible inhibition of CDK4/Cyclin D1, with an 
inhibition constant value of 0.[ADDRESS_890910] of HSPCs has been shown to be transient and readily reversible 
in both in vitro  and in vivo models. In vivo analysis has demonstrated that trilaciclib 
administered prior to myelosuppressive chemotherapy leads to improved complete blood count  
(CBC) recovery of all blood lineages and increased survival. Specifically, in a model usi ng the 
highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), while the extent and duration of  
nadir in CBCs worsened after each cycle of [ADDRESS_890911] and the animals that received trilaciclib + 5 -FU 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 23 demonstrated a faster rate of recovery of CBCs compared with the 5 -FU alone group following 
Cycle 4 ( He, 2017a ).  
Nonclinical data have shown trilaciclib enhance s immune activation and promotes anti-tumor 
immunity by [CONTACT_660621] T cell subsets followe d by a faster 
recovery of cytotoxic T lymphocytes than Tregs  in tumors. Specifically, the addition of 
trilaciclib to various che motherapy/ICI treatment combinations resulted in enhanced tumor 
growth delay and durability of the anti-tumor response. Trilaciclib favorably modulated t he 
proliferation of T cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment, consistent with an enha nced 
cytotoxic T cell response ( Figure 2 ; Lai, 2020 ). This differential alteration of cell cycle kinetics 
between cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Tregs  results in a higher proportion of cytotoxic 
T lymphocytes than Tregs, enhancement of T cell activation, and a decrease in Treg -mediated 
immunosuppressive functions ( Chaikovsky and Sage,  2018; Deng , 2018; Goel , 2017; 
Schaer , 2018 ). Together, these events promote the cytotoxic T lymphocyte- mediated clearance o f 
tumor cells. Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that trilaciclib -mediated transient 
proliferative arrest of T cells (protecting them from chemotherapy -induced damage), followed by 
[CONTACT_660623] T lymphocytes in the context of fewer Tregs led to the anti-tumor 
response observed.  
Nonclinical data have shown that in an extremely CDK4/[ADDRESS_890912] chemotherapy treatment.  The lack of antagonism when trilaciclib was 
added to chemotherapy treatment was observed in multiple CDK4/6 dependent models 
(Sorrentino, 2018 ).

Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 24 [IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetic Studies  
Pharmacokinetic studies in rats and dogs showed that the relationship between dose leve l and 
plasma exposure to trilaciclib was generally similar betwee n males and females and did not 
change with repeated daily dosing. Exposure to trilaciclib increased with dose level, but not  
always proportionally.  
In vitro analyses of direct and time -dependent inhibition suggest that drug interactions based on 
inhibiti on of cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2-, 2B6-, 2C8-, 2C9-, 2C19-, and 2D6- mediated 
metabolic pathways are unlikely at clinical doses, however, the studies do suggest that dr ug 
interactions based on trilaciclib -mediated inhibition of CYP3A4- mediated metabolic pathw ays 
are possible, but clinical studies have confirmed no clinically significant drug-drug i nteraction 
(DDI) based on CYP3A (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 for additional details). Additionally, in vitro  
induction studies of the 3 major inducible CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2B6) in 
human hepatocytes suggest that trilaciclib -mediated induction is unlikely.  
In vitro inhibition studies with membrane transporter model systems also suggest trilaciclib is 
unlikely to cause a DDI based on inhibition of breast cancer resistance protein-, bi le salt export 
pump-, organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1)-, organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) -, organic anion 
transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1)-, p-glycoprotein-, multidrug resistance protein 1 
(MRP1) -, multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2)-, or organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 
(OATP1B3) -mediated transport.  
However, in vit ro, trilaciclib is a potent inhibitor of multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1), 
multidrug and toxin extrusion 2- K (MATE2 -K), organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1), and 
organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 for additional details ).

Based on data from the aforementioned SCLC trials, the US FDA approved trilaciclib 
(COSELA™) as a treatment to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy -induced 
myelosuppression in adult patients when administered prior to a platinum/etoposide-contai ning 
regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for ES- SCLC  in February 2021. 
At the approved dose of 240 mg/m2, across all three SCLC studies , trilaciclib administered prior 
to chemotherapy statistically significantly reduced the duration of severe neutrope nia (D SN) in 
Cycle 1 and occurrence of severe neutropenia ( SN) (primary endpoints) compared with placebo. 
An integrated data analysis of the three SCLC studies (G1T28-02, G1T28-03, and G1T28- 05) for 
[ADDRESS_890916] relevant myelosuppression endpoints (e.g., neutrophils, red blood cells [ RBCs ] and 
platelets) demonstrated statistically significant, and clinically mea ningful, improvements for 
trilaciclib over available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] 6  of 8 endpoints across multiple lineages. Importantly, these 
myeloprotective benefits come with an overall improved safety profile compared with available 
therapy, as evidenced by [CONTACT_332872] h igh grade treatment -emergent adverse events ( AEs) across all

the results, refer to the trilaciclib IB.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Clinical Experience in TNBC  
Study G1T28-04 in patients with advanced TNBC did not meet its primary endpoint of 
myeloprotection (DSN in Cycle 1 and occurrence of SN) , though a clinically meaningful benefit 
in OS was observed when trilaciclib was added to GC chemotherapy. The combination of 
trilaciclib and GC demonstrated a  substantial improvement in anti -tumor efficacy as measured by 
[CONTACT_70112] (median OS duration [95% confidence interval ( CI)] in control: 12.6 months [6.3, 15.6] vs. 
not evaluable [10.2, not evaluable] or 17.8 months [12.9, 32.7] in the two trilaciclib groups, 
respectively) and by [CONTACT_3988]- free survival ( PFS) (median PFS [95% CI] in control 
5.7 months [3.3, 9.9] vs. 9.4 months [6.1, 11.9] or 7.3 months [6.2, 13.9] in the two trilaciclib 
groups , respectively ) (Tan, 2019 ; O’Shaughnessy, 2020 ). The clinically meaningful anti-tumor 
efficacy results observed in G1T28-04 were noted across both of the trilaciclib tre atment groups 
and in patients with both PD-L1 positive and negative tumors, and these benefits were observe d 
for multiple anti -tumor efficacy endpoints, with objective response rate (ORR), PFS, and OS 
endpoints all showing numerical improvement with the addition of trilaciclib to GC compar ed 
with GC alone. These results were observed in the context of a control group that is refl ective of 
published literature for this patient population. Furthermore, there were trends toward 
improvement in RBC and platelet -based measures  as well as benefit in PRO endpoints . Given 
the en couraging evidence of improved anti-tumor activity as well as positive PRO s observed in 
Study G1T28- 04, a Phase [ADDRESS_890917]- or second- line 
treatment for locally advanced unresectable/metastatic disease is currently ong oing (G1T28-208, 
PRESERVE 2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Pharmacokinetics  
The PK and clinical pharmacology of trilaciclib have been assessed in studies wit h healthy 
subjects, patients receiving chemotherapy (studies noted above), specific populations , and in 
DDI studies (see trilaciclib IB for details ). 
Trilaciclib has a terminal half -life of approximately [ADDRESS_890918] on trilaciclib PK. Two clinical DDI studies using a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole were also conducted. No clinically significant changes  in exposure 
were observed for trilaciclib when co -administered with itraconazole.  
In an additional clini cal DDI assessment in healthy subjects, concomitant use of trilaciclib 
increased metformin (OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K substrate) area under the plasma  
concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC inf) and maximum concentration by 
[CONTACT_3450] 65% and 81%, respectively. Renal clearance of metformin was decrea sed by 37%. 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 27 There were no clinically significant differences in topotecan (MATE1 and M ATE-2K substrate) 
pharmacokinetics when used concomitantly with trilaciclib.  
Trilaciclib is an inhibitor o f OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K. Co- administration of trilaciclib 
may increase the concentration or net accumulation of OCT2, MATE1, and MATE- 2K 
substrates in the kidney (e.g., dofetilide, dalfampridine, and cisplatin). Refer to the pres cribing 
information for these concomitant medications for assessing the benefit and risk of  concomitant 
use of trilaciclib.  
Table 2: Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with Trilaciclib  
Drugs  Recommendations  Comments  
Dofetilide  The potential benefits of 
taking trilaciclib 
concurrently with dofetilide 
should be considered 
against the risk of QT 
interval prolongation.  Increased dofetilide blood levels may occur in patients who 
are also receiving trilaciclib. Increased plasma concentrations 
of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias 
associated with QT interval prolongation, including torsade 
de pointes.  
Dalfampridine  The potential benefits of 
taking trilaciclib 
concurrently with 
dalfampridine should be 
conside red against the risk 
of seizures in these patients.  Increased dalfampridine blood levels may occur in patients 
who are also receiving trilaciclib. Elevated levels of 
dalfampridine increase the risk of seizure.  
Cisplatin  Closely monitor for 
nephrotoxicity .  Concurrent treatment with trilaciclib may increase the 
exposure and alter the net accumulation of cisplatin in the 
kidney, which may associate with dose -related 
nephrotoxicity.  
 
Based on both nonclinical and clinical data, trilaciclib does not inhibit or induce any of the C YP 
enzymes . Therefore, the risk of a  DDI with the concurrent anticancer medications used in this 
study (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab) based on a 
CYP mechanism is minimal to nil . Trilacicli b is a known inhibitor of the drug transport proteins 
OCT2, MATE1, and MATE-2K; however , none of the concurrent anticancer medications used in 
this study are known substrates of these transporters. Therefore, the risk of a drug tra nsporter 
based DDI is minimal to nil.  
4.4.3.  Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Trilaciclib  
Reproductive/embryo- fetal effects are  an important potential risk of trilaciclib. Both nonclinical 
toxicology studies with trilaciclib, and clinical studies with other compounds with a simila r 
MOA, report effects on either the reproductive system or embryo/fetus. Since this  clinical study 
will focus on trilaciclib administered prior to  cytotoxic chemotherapy (which carries its own risk 
of reproductive/embryo- fetal toxicity), the risks specific to trilaciclib are consistent wit h those 
experienced with chemotherapy. In addition, female patients will be required to have  a negative 
pregnancy test prior to the first dose of study drug and will be monitored while on study. 
Eligibility criteria describing specific birth control methods are incorporated in the protocol and 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 28 the informed consent form (ICF) . Dose discontinuation recommendations for female patients 
who become pregnant while receiving trilaciclib are also provided in the protocol 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Detailed information regarding all important identified and important 
potential risks of trilaciclib administration can be found in the t rilaciclib IB.  
At the clinical dose of 240 mg/m2 being used in this study, trilaciclib did not have a clinically 
relevant effect on QTc (i.e., >10 msec).  
In an integrated safety analysis from the four Phase 2 oncology studies conducted with tri laciclib 
to date (G1T28-02 [complete], G1T28-03 [data cutoff: 31 May 2019], G1T28-05 [data cutoff: 
28 Jun 2019], and G1T28- 04 [complete]), the most common treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) (≥10%) that occurred more frequently in patients receiving trilacicl ib compa red with 
placebo were nausea, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, hypokalemia, and infusion related 
reaction. Trilaciclib -related TEAEs occurring in ≥5% of patients with at least a ≥2% higher 
incidence in trilaciclib compared with placebo were nausea, fatig ue, anemia, headache, infusion 
related reaction, neutrophil count decreased, decreased appetite, vomiting, and constipa tion. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) identified for trilaciclib in the  integrated safety 
summary are described below. Some AE SIs have been infrequently reported (or not reported) in 
the trilaciclib clinical program to date but are considered to be potential class eff ects of CDK4/6 
inhibitors. However, as trilaciclib is given intravenously ( IV) and only when chemotherapy is 
administered, the safety profile of trilaciclib appears to be different from tha t of the oral, 
chronically -dosed members of its pharmacologic class. All patients will be monitored for these 
events and dose modification and discontinuation guidelines are provided in Section  9.3. 
Trilaciclib AESIs : 
1. Injection Site Reaction/Phlebitis/Thrombophlebitis:  Infusion of trilaciclib can cause 
injection -site reactions i ncluding phlebitis and thrombophlebitis. Injection- site reactions 
including phlebitis and thrombophlebitis occurred in 56 (21%) of 272 patients receiving 
trilaciclib in clinical trials, including Grade 2 (10%) and Grade 3 (0.4%) AEs. The  
median time to ons et from start of trilaciclib was 15 days (range 1 to 542) and from the 
preceding dose of trilaciclib was 1 day (1 to 15). The median duration was 1 day (range 1 
to 151 for the resolved cases). Injection-site reactions including phlebitis and 
thrombophlebitis resolved in 49 (88%) of the 56 patients and led to discontinuation of 
treatment in 3 (1%) of the 272 patients. 
2. Acute Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction:  Trilaciclib can cause acute drug 
hypersensitivity reactions, including facial edema and urticaria. Acute drug 
hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 16 (6%) of 272 patients receiving trilacicl ib in 
clinical trials, including Grade 2 reactions (2%). One patient experienced a G rade 2 
anaphylactic reaction 4 days after receiving trilaciclib, which resolved with  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
and treatment with trilaciclib was continued. The median time to onset from start of 
trilaciclib was 77 days (range 2 to 256) and from the preceding dose of trilaciclib was 
1 day (range 1 to 28). The median duration was 6 days (range 1 to 69 for the resolved 
cases). Acute drug hypersensitivity reactions resolved in 12 (75%) of the 16 patients . 
3. Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease  (ILD) : Severe, life -threatening, or fatal ILD 
and/or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors, the same drug 
class as trilaciclib. ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 1 (0.4%) of 272 patients receiving 
Protocol   G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022   
 29 trilaciclib in clinical trials. The event was Grade 3 and reported 2 months after 
discontinuing trilaciclib, in a patient receiving a confounding medication. The event did 
not resolve.  
4. Hepatotoxicity:  Both nonclinical toxicology studies with trilaciclib, and clinical studies 
with other compounds with a similar MOA, report reversible elevations in transam inases 
with continuous dosing. There has been only 1 instance of Grade 4 alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increase in a patient receiving trilaciclib, no Grade 4 as partate 
aminotransferase (AST) increases, and no cases of Hy’s law reported in patients 
receiving trilaciclib. However, generally low grade and transient increases in A ST, ALT, 
or bilirubin have been observed in a small number of patients (~5%) receiving trilacic lib 
prior to chemotherapy. Patients with mild hepatic impairment have  been treated with 
trilaciclib without a clinically significant increase in exposure or the frequen cy/severity 
of AEs.  
5. Embolic and Thrombotic Events, Venous:  The CDK4/[ADDRESS_890919] cancer. This same risk has not been reporte d for 
the other approved oral CDK4/6 inhibitors (ribociclib and palbociclib); therefore, it is  not 
clear if this is a class effect. Approximately 3% of cancer patients that received t rilaciclib 
prior to chemotherapy experienced a venous thromboembolic event and half of those 
events (3/6) were Grade 3 or 4. No Grade 5 events were reported. Approximately 2% of 
patients receiving chemotherapy alone or with placebo reported an embolic or thromboti c 
event, 1 of 3 such events was Grade 3.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Tumor Biopsy Collection  
Risks associated with tumor biopsy may include: stinging pain from injection of local aesthetic; 
pain or discomfort from the biopsy procedure; bleeding, swelling, scarring, soreness , or bruising; 
infection  of wound; and contamination of cancer cells  to unaffected tissue when removing 
biopsy needle. 
4.5. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safety and effectiveness of an 
investigational medicine  which  may not always provide direct benefit to the patients 
participating in the trial . In this study, it is unknown whether patients will receive additional 
benefit above that of SOC with the addition of trilaciclib . Potential benefits of trilaciclib  are 
addressed in Section  4.4.2.  Completed  studies with trilaciclib have demonstrated a manageable 
safety profile  in combination with several different chemotherapy regimens. Though trilaciclib 
has not been fully evaluated with an anthracycline/taxane chemotherapy regimen  to date, the 
risks of AC/T  (with and without carboplatin) are well documented. In particular, trilaciclib is not 
associated with significant cardiac risks, unlike anthracyclines which carry a risk of 
cardiomyopathy. There are no known risks of DDI with trilaciclib  and these chemotherapy 
agents nor pembrolizumab. In Study G1T28- 04, the rates of overall toxicity were comparable in 
patients who received trilaciclib with GC versus GC alone despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] 2- fold increase in the 
median number of cycles and 50% increase in the cumulative dose of both gemcitabine and 
carbop latin in patients who received trilaciclib. Rates of discontinuation due to an AE wer e not 
different between the trilaciclib groups and the GC alone group. PRO data also suggested that 
patients on trilaciclib (compared with GC alone) had a better experienc e receiving 
chemotherapy . Finally, e fficacy in Study G1T28-04 demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit 
in OS and PFS when trilaciclib was added to GC. A coronavirus disease (C OVID )-19 risk 
assessment has been performed, documented, and will be provided as a separate document.  
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for patients  participating in this  clinical 
trial may be found in the trilaciclib  IB and informed consent documents.

6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open- label, single -arm, neoadjuvant study with 4 phases: 
1) Screening  Phase, 2) Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase , 3) Treatment  Phase,  and 4) Surgery and 
Follow- Up Phase . A study schema is provided in  Figure 3.  A total of approximately  30 patien ts 
will be enrolled in  the study. 
During the Screening Phase, tumor tissue (sample  #1) will be obtained at baseline  prior to any 
study drug. This sample may be archival tissue, or if unavailable/insufficient, then a fre sh biopsy 
is required . Patients with adequate archival tissue will also have the option to provide a fresh 
biopsy at baseline. Patients will receive a single dose of monotherapy trilaciclib 240  mg/m2 in 
the Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase, followed by [CONTACT_178523] ( sample #2 ) 7 (±1) days later. Following 
the biopsy, patients will enter  the Treatment Phase  in which trilaciclib  240 mg/m2 on Day 1 of 
each cycle  will be administered  along with dose- dense anthracycline/cyclophosphamide 
followed by [CONTACT_660630] (doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 
600 mg/m2 [AC] every 2  weeks for 4  cycles  [Cycles 1 -4], then weekly paclitaxel  [T] 80 mg/m2 
weekly for 12 cycles  [Cycles 5 -16]). If pembrolizumab is given (per Investigator discretion), it 
will start with AC ( Cycle 1 of chemotherapy). If carboplatin is given (per Investigator discretion) 
it will start with paclitaxel ( Cycle 5).  
Growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony stimulating factor [G- CSF]) should be administered 
after each cycle of AC chemotherapy and/or per Investigator discretion. Prem edications will be 
given in accordance with local institutional guidelines.  
Treatment cycles will occur consecutively without interruption, except when neces sary to 
manage toxicities or for administrative reasons. There should be no more than 4 weeks between 
doses of chemotherapy. Dosing delays >[ADDRESS_890920] dose of chemotherapy, patients will proceed to definitive s urgery 
at which time tumor tissue (sample #3) will be collected if the patient has residual disea se. A 
30-day Safety Follow-up V isit will occur 30 (+7) days after last dose of trilaciclib and an End of 
Study Visit will occur within 14 days after surgery. Both the Safety Follow-up Visit a nd End of 
Study Visit may be conducted in person or by [CONTACT_660631] .  
Tumor and blood collection is detailed in Section  11.2 . A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) 
will monitor accumulating data throughout the study on a regular basis, as described in 
Section  11.[ADDRESS_890921] been 
met, or upon Sponsor termination of the study.

 36 6.2. Rationale for the Primary Endpoint  
Clinically meaningful anti-tumor efficacy results were observed in G1T28-04 in patients with 
advanced TNBC and were noted across multiple endpoints, including OS, PFS, and ORR. These 
results are currently being evaluated further in a Phase 3 study in advanced TNBC patients  
(G1T 28-208 ; PRESERVE  2). However, the MOA  of trilaciclib in TNBC  is not completely  
understood and much remains to be learned regarding how best to leverage trilaciclib in treating 
patients . Earlier pre -clinical and translational data from SCLC studies demonstr ate an 
enhancement of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation following trilaciclib treatment 
(Lai, 2020 ). Specifically, trilaciclib -exposed T cells were able to withstand Treg suppression and 
proliferate, and longitudinal assessment of splenic T cell proliferation in trilac iclib treated mice, 
demonstrate d a peak response of 4 days for CD8 + T cells and 7 days for CD4+ T cells. 
Additionally, in SCLC patients treated with trilaciclib, the ratio of CD8 +/Tregs increased over 
time suggesting an increase in CD8 + T cell proliferation and/or depletion of Tregs in circulation. 
Based on these changes in the immune response during the course of t rilaciclib treatment, the 
endpoints for th is study are to measure cytotoxic CD8 + T cell infiltration in  the tumor 
microenvironment and to quantitate the changes in cytotoxic CD8 + T cell /Tregs [ADDRESS_890922] 
single dose monotherapy trilaciclib  (and prior to any chemotherapy/immunotherapy). Seven days 
was selected  as the optimal  timepoint for evaluating  the immu ne MOA  of trilaciclib based on 
parallel assessment of TILs in checkpoint blockade therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Kim, 2019; Choe, 2019 ). 
Collectively, the primary endpoint for this study will provide insight into the t rilaciclib -specific 
effect on the generation of an anti -tumor T cell response.  
6.3. Rationale for Tumor  Biopsy  Collection  
Nonclinical data and data from samples of patients treated with trilaciclib suggest tha t the MOA 
of trilaciclib involves enhancement of immune activation and promotes anti-tumor im munity by 
[CONTACT_660621] T cell subsets followed by a faster recovery of 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes than Tregs  in tumor (See Section  4.1.1 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). The 
immune system is a network of dynamic players that are interdependent and is theref ore difficult 
to capture in a single snapshot. Access to tumor tissue before, during, and after trilaci clib will be  
critical in understanding the immune response of trilaciclib and the complex interactions within 
the tumor microenvironment. This study will enable comprehensive analysis of biomarker 
endpoints and correlation with clinical activity, thus providing important insights  into the 
immune, anti- neoplastic MOA of trilaciclib, identifying biomarkers for patient selection in future 
studies, and elucidat ing mechanisms of resistance to trilaciclib treatment.  
Longitudinal tissue-based studies will be evaluate d at 3 time points . Baseline tumor samples will 
provide initial immune features including PD-L1 expression and quantitation of cytotoxic CD8+ 
T cells and Tregs  in untreated tumors which may be predictive of treatment response. 
Subsequent tumor samples will be analyzed similarly to discern dynamic changes during the  
course of therapy. Several studies have demonstrated that monitoring on- treatment tumor 
immune response via paired  biopsies is more predictive of  treatment outcome than immune 
features  observed in only baseline samples  (Lesterhuis , 2017 ; Park, 2020 ). The [ADDRESS_890923] 
trilaciclib timepoint is supported by [CONTACT_660632]-PD-1 therapy  showing peak  cytotoxic 
CD8 + T cell proliferation  in blood samples approximately [ADDRESS_890924] initial treatment  and are 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 37 predictive of response ( Huang, 2019 ; Kim, 2019 ). Overall, assessment of tumor biopsies will 
provide an immune analysis that is more reflective o f the localized tumor immune environment. 
6.4. Rationale for Peripheral Blood Collection  
Longitudinal blood-based studies will provide a correlative assessment of the immune response 
during the course of the study. Unlike biopsy collection, blood samples are less invasive to 
obtain, can be collected more frequently, and provide a significant number of cells for 
multi -analysis . Blood will be collected at the same time points as tumor bi opsy collection plus an 
additional time point  at C2D1 of trilaciclib plus chemotherapy . All blood samples will be 
analyzed via mass spectrometry for immune profiling and flow cytometry for function al 
assessment via the measurement of cytokine production.  
6.5. Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Trilaciclib  
Previous studies demonstrated the recommended phase 2 dose of trilaciclib was 240 mg/m2, and 
this dose is now approved by [CONTACT_660633]. When trilaciclib was 
administered prior to chemotherapy to cancer patients, doses of 200 mg/m2 (rounded up from 
192 mg/m2), 240 mg/m2, and 280 mg/m2 were evaluated. Trilaciclib exposures  in cancer patients 
were slightly lower compared with healthy subjects, such that the dose of 240 mg/m2 (rather than 
200 mg/m2) more closely matched the biologically effective dose of 192 mg/m2. In addition, the 
dose of 240 mg/m2 demonstrated maximal myelo protection efficacy benefits (compared with 
200 mg/m2 and 280 mg/m2) as measured by a variety of myeloprotection endpoints. The 
myeloprotective effect at 240 mg/m2 was further evaluated and confirmed in three randomized 
controlled P hase 2 studies in SCLC patients.  See the trilaciclib IB for details.  
In all studies enrolling cancer patients, trilaciclib is always administered prior to systemic 
chemotherapy on each day of chemotherapy administration. Trilaciclib shall not be administered 
as monotherapy ( i.e., on days that chemotherapy will be delayed) except for a single dose during 
the Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase, which will be used to evaluate changes in the tumor 
microenvironment prior to beginning the chemotherapy regimen. 
6.6. Rationale for Patient Population  
Among all breast cancer subtypes, TNBC  has the worst prognosis and limited treatment options . 
Due to lack of specific molecular targets, treatment of TNBC has  been relying on chemotherapy, 
in particular, anthracycline and taxane  combinations. In light of the positive impact on OS 
duration observed in Study G1T28-04, as well as trilaciclib’s manageable safety profile and 
improvement in PRO  and myeloprotection endpoints, trilaciclib has the potential  to add to the 
armamentarium of  treating TNBC , an area of high unmet medical need. As such, better 
understanding of the immune mechanism of trilaciclib is greatly warranted.   
Protocol  G1T28-[ADDRESS_890925] conservation and 
has a positive and significant correlation of pCR with long- term clinical benefit and OS 
(Liedtke, 2008 ). Early prospective observational studies evaluating outcome of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy in differe nt breast cancer subtypes revealed that TNBC was more chemosensitive 
compared with non-T NBC  subtypes such as ER-positive, H ER2-negative (luminal), with 
substantially increased pCR rate and clinical response rate. However, as a group, patients with 
TNBC had a poorer prognosis with significantly higher disease recurrence rate and low er 
survival rate. The poor long-term outcome in TNBC was found to be driven by [CONTACT_660634]  (FDA , 2014; EMA , 2014 ). Patients who achieved 
pCR demonstrated sustained clinical benefit regardless of bre ast cancer subtypes  (Carey , 2007 ; 
Liedtke, 2008 ).A large, pooled  analysis demonstrated patients who attain pCR, when defined as 
no tumor in both breast and lymph nodes (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is yp N0), have improved 
survival, with the strongest association  observed in patients with TNBC (Cortazar , 2014 ).  
6.8. Rationale for Anthracycl ine/Taxane -Based  Chemotherapy  
Per current  National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guidelines, dose-dense AC 
(doxorubicin /cyclophosphamide) followed by [CONTACT_660635] a preferred regimen for neoadjuvant 
therapy for HER2- negative  breast cancer patients.  Addition of a taxane to an anthracycline -based 
regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve both DFS and OS in locally-
advanced breast cancer  (De Laurentiis , 2008 ). The pCR rate for paclitaxel followed by [CONTACT_660636] 30% ( von Minckwitz, 2011 ).  
The optimal schedule of paclitaxel was evaluated in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG ) E1199 trial in which neoadjuvant paclitaxel every 3 weeks for 4 cycles was compared 
to weekly for 12 cycles ( Sparano , 2015 ). Weekly paclitaxel improved DFS and OS in the TNBC  
subset compared with the every 3 week paclitaxel arm. Weekly paclitaxel was also u sed as part 
of the chemotherapy backbone in the CALGB40603 and GeparSixto trials. As such, dose- dense 
AC followed by [CONTACT_660637].  
To date, trilaciclib has demonstrated a manageable safety profile in combinat ion with various 
chemotherapy agents, including gemcitabine, carboplatin, etoposide, and topotecan. 
Furthermore,  the Phase 2 adaptive I-SPY2 study ( NCT01 042379) has included a study arm to 
evaluat e the safety and efficacy of trilaciclib in combination with neoadjuvant paclitaxel  (80 
mg/m2 weekly)  followed by [CONTACT_140647] (60 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) every 
[ADDRESS_890926] cancer . Data from this study are pending. 
6.9. Rationale for Pembrolizumab  (per Investigator Discretion)  
Pembrolizumab functions as an immune checkpoint blockade by [CONTACT_226167]-1, which helps to 
restore endogenou s anti -cancer immunity. Pembrolizumab has shown significant clinical 
anti-cancer activity across multiple tumor types including  melanoma, NSCLC, head and neck 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 39 cancer, bladder cancer and has gained FDA approval for treating early -stage and advanced 
TNBC, melanoma, head and neck cancer , and NSCLC . 
Support for the use of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition is provided by a recent meta -analysis which found 
that the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves 
pCR rates in  TNBC patients  (Tarantino , 2021 ). In an earlier Phase 1b study, pembrolizumab in 
combination with different chemotherapy regimens as neoadjuvant treatment for high-r isk, 
early -stage TNBC  resulted in pCR rates of 60% across all groups ( Schmid , 2020b ). These data 
are further  supported by [CONTACT_128633] [ADDRESS_890927] neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, regardless of disease PD -L1 status ( Schmid , 2020a ; [COMPANY_006] Press Release , 2021 ). 
Longer follow-up of the ongoing clinical trials is needed to confirm whether the incre ased in 
pCR rate will translate into a meaningful survival benefit.  
Based  on nonclinical studies, CDK4/[ADDRESS_890928] been shown to enhance anti-tumor T cell 
activity through stabilization of PD -L1 expression on tumor cells, resulting in increased 
sensitivity to ICI, such as  the PD -1 or PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies ( Lai 2020; Deng  2018 ). 
Further, the addition of trilaciclib to chemotherapy/IC I combination has been shown to enhance 
the anti -tumor response ( Lai 2020 ). Collectively, these nonclinical data support the combination 
of CDK4/6 inhibitors like trilaciclib with ICI. In the clinical setting,  trilaciclib was well tolerated 
when given prior to induction treatment with the PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab and 
etoposide/ carboplatin  (E/P/A ) in patients with  SCLC  (Daniel , 2020 ). Compared with placebo, 
fewer patients treated with trilaciclib in combination with E/P/A experienced  serious AEs and 
Grade [ADDRESS_890929] option 
for the patient  at the dose level of 400 mg every 6 weeks. Though the dose level in 
KEYNOTE -522 was 300 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) , the FDA granted accelerated approval to the 
400 mg every 6 week regimen based on PK modeling, safety, and exposure-response analyses in 
the Study KEYNOTE -555. In light of these data and convenience with the dose-dense AC and 
weekly paclitaxel schedule, the every 6 week do sing schedule for pembrolizumab was chosen for 
this study ( Keytruda® Prescribing Information, 2021 ).  
6.10. Rationale for Carboplatin (per Investigator Discretion)  
Neoadjuvant carboplatin in combination with weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 versus paclitaxel  
alone followed by [CONTACT_660638]/cyclophosphamide combination has shown 
increased pCR rates  in patients  with TNBC via 2 randomized trials using either w eekly 
carboplatin at AUC  2 (the Phase II GeparSixto trial ; von Minckwitz, 2014 ), or carboplatin at 
AUC 6 Q3W (the Phase III CALGB [ZIP_CODE] trial ; Sikov, 2015 ). Due to toxicity, in the GeparSixto 
trial, the dose of carboplatin was reduced to AUC 1.5. A meta- analysis  of 1,598 TNBC patients 
treated with platinum -based neoadjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a pCR of 45%, with a 
significantly increased rate of pCR in those treated with platinum therapy vs. nonplatinum  agents 
(risk ratio  1.45 (95% CI, 1.25 -1.68, p<0.0001 ; Petrelli , 2014 ). It is worth noting that in the 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE] study the carboplatin AUC6 Q3W plus weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 arm showed 
statistically significant increase in Grade 3/4 neutropenia (56% vs. 22%) and Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia (20% vs. 4%) compared to paclitaxel alone arm. Taken together, the use of 
carboplatin in the neoadjuvant setting may provide benefit to some patients (as evidenced b y 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 40 pCR);  however, the survival effect has not been confirmed and platinum- based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660592].  
Carboplatin ( with gemcitabine) has been studied in combination with trilaciclib in the Phase 2  
study G1T28-04 in locally recurrent/metastatic TNBC patients  (see Section  4.4.2 ). A total of 
68 patients were exposed to both carboplatin and trilaciclib in this study. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a longer 
duration of chemotherapy in the trilaciclib groups, Grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxiciti es 
associated with chemotherapy  were reported at a similar frequency in patients with and without 
trilaciclib  (Tan, 2019 ). As such, it is possible that the myeloprotective effects of trilaciclib may 
lessen the hematologic toxicities well documented with carboplatin . 
In this study, carboplatin may be administered per Investigator discretion. The decis ion to add 
carboplatin should be made by [CONTACT_660639]. The option to add pembrolizumab and 
carboplatin are exclusive of one another.

Trilaciclib must be reconstituted and further diluted prior to IV infusion as outli ned in the 
Pharmacy Manual. Aseptic technique must  be used for reconstitution and dilution. Following  
reconstitution, the solution must then be diluted to the calculated dose based on the body surface  
area (BSA) of the patient. Actual body weight should be utilized for dose calculations . If there is 
a cha nge in body weight ≥10% relative to the weight at the time of the last dose calculation, dose  
should be recalculated. Recalculation of dose more frequently per local institutional  guidelines is 
permitted. Dose recalculation to adjust for changes in body weight will not be considered a dos e 
reduction and will be made at the discretion of the Investigator. No trilaciclib dose r eductions for 
toxicity management will be allowed during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Administration of Trilaciclib  
• Administer diluted trilaciclib solut ion as a 30-minute IV infusion completed within 
4 hours prior to the start of chemotherapy.  
• When administered with chemotherapy, trilaciclib is always administered first.  
Results from hematology labs should be reviewed prior to administration of 
trilacicl ib. If administration of chemotherapy is delayed or discontinued, trilaciclib 
will also be delayed or discontinued. 
• Diluted trilaciclib solution must be administered with an infusion set, including an 
in-line filter (0.2 or 0.22 micron). Compatible in- line filters include polyeth er sulfone, 
polyvinylidene fluoride, and cellulose acetate.  
• Do not administer diluted trilaciclib solution with a polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) 
in-line filter. PTFE in -line filters are not compatible with diluted trilaciclib soluti on. 
• Do not co-administer other drugs through the same infusion line.  
• Do not co-administer other drugs through a central access device unless the device 
supports co-administration of incompatible drugs.  
If there is any study drug remaining in the infusion bag at the end of the [ADDRESS_890946] ered 
to ensure patients receive the full dose. Upon completion of infusion of diluted trilacicl ib 
solution, the infu sion line/cannula must be flushed with at least 20 mL sterile 5% dextrose in 
water or sterile 0.9% sodium chloride in water  (normal saline ). 
The infusion rate may be decreased to manage an infusion- related AE; for example, if a patient 
experiences a burning sensation during infusion, the duration of infusion may be increased to 
45 minutes (or longer if clinically indicated) to alleviate the symptom . 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 50 [IP_ADDRESS].  Chemotherapy Backbone: Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Paclitaxel  
Descriptions of the formulations of commercially  available doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and 
paclitaxel  can be found in the respective current prescribing information. The dose amount 
required for chemotherapy will be calculated based on milligrams per square meter o f BSA  
(mg/m2). Premedications should be administered as per prescribing information or per 
institutional standard.  
Doxorubicin at a dose level of  60 mg /m2 will be administered by [CONTACT_239208] [ADDRESS_890947].  
Cyclophosphamide at a dose level of 600 mg/m2 will be administered by [CONTACT_660643] 1 of Cycles 1 through 4.  
Paclitaxel at a dose level of 80 mg/m2 will be administered by [CONTACT_660644] 1 of Cycles 5 through 16.  
Actual body weight should be utilized for dose calculations. If there is a change in body weight 
≥10% relative to the weight at the  time of the last dose calculation, dose should be recalculated. 
Recalculation of dose more frequently per local institutional guidelines is permitted . Dose 
recalculation to adjust for changes in body weight will not be considered a dose reduction and 
will be made at the discretion of the Investigator. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment per  Investigator Discretion: Carboplatin and Pembrolizumab  
Descriptions of the formulations of commercially available carboplatin and pem brolizumab  can 
be found in the respective current prescribing information. If carboplatin is administered , the 
dose amount required will be calculated as  AUC at a dose level of 1.[ADDRESS_890948] .  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Sequence of Administration of Study Drugs  
The sequence of administration on treatment days as outlined in  Table  4 is as follows (Figure 4) : 
• Trilaciclib is always administered first  and infusion must be complete  before 
administrating other agents.  
• If pembrolizumab is given, it will be administered  after trilaciclib  and before 
chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab may be administered immediately following 
trilaciclib, but not until the completion of the trilaciclib infusion.  
• SOC c hemotherapy (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel) is always 
administered after trilaciclib  (and pembrolizumab if given). Trilaciclib (and 
pembrolizumab) infusions must be complete before initiating chemotherapy. The 
interval between completion of the trilaciclib infusion and the initiation of the first 
chemotherapy  drug should not be greater than 4 hours.  
• The order of administration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is per institutional 
standard . 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 51 • If carboplatin is given, the order of administration of paclitaxel and carboplatin is per 
institutional standard.

9.1.2.  Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability 
The Investigator or institution is responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliation, a nd 
record maintenance (i .e., receipt, reconciliation,  dispensing, and final disposition records). The 
Investigator/institution may assign some or all of the Investigator’s /institution’s duties for 
investigational product(s) accountability to an appropriate pharmacist or another appropr iate 
individual who is under the supervision of the Investigator /institu tion. 
Further guidance and information are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
9.1.3.  Treatment Compliance  
The Investigator or designee will dispense the study drug, via a P harmacist/ designee, only for 
use by [CONTACT_660645] (Section  9.1). The study drug 
shall  not be used for reasons other than those described in this protocol. The clinical study site 
will maintain reco rds of study drug receipt, preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable 
lot and vial numbers; patient’s height, body weight, and BSA; date and time of the start of each 
infusion for trilaciclib, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel (and carboplatin and 
pembrolizumab if appliable); and planned and actual infusion volumes. 
9.2. Criteria for Starting Study Treatment  and Each Subsequent Cycle  
Patients must meet specific hematologic criteria for each dosing day per Table 6 and Table  7 and 
any nonhematologic toxicities (except alopecia) must be ≤  Grade [ADDRESS_890949] returned to baseline . 
Study drug administration will continue as per protocol to completion or early discontinuati on of 
chemotherapy, until unacceptable toxicity, Investigator’s decision to withdraw the patient  from 
study treatment, pregnancy of the patient , noncompliance with study treatment or procedure 
requirements, consent withdrawal, becoming lost- to-follow-up, death, or administrative reasons 
require cessation of treatment . 
Note: C1D1 of the Treatment Phase may be the same day as the on -treatment biopsy  (7 days 
[±1 day] after trilaciclib monotherapy), as long as the biopsy is done prior to initiation of 
chemotherapy. 
9.3.  Toxicity Management and Dose Modifications  
Toxicities will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute ( NCI)-Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), Version 5.0. For dose delays due to toxicity, 
the patient should be followed (at least) weekly to monitor the toxicity until treatment cr iteria are 
met or until they discontinue treatment. No more than 2 dose reductions in total are allowed per 

Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 52 study drug ( expect trila ciclib for which no dose reductions are allowed). Toxicity that requires 
dose reductions more than twice  for one study drug will lead to discontinuation of that study 
drug. If a dose delay does not require discontinuation of chemotherapy, patients may resu me 
treatment when dosing criteria are met  and continue on treatment to complete the full number of 
cycles per protocol. 
All dose reductions are permanent,  and no dose increases will occur following a dose reduction. 
Likewise, discontinuation from treatment is permanent and once a patient has had a compon ent 
or entire treatment discontinued, it may not be restarted.  
9.3.1.  Dose Modifications for Trilaciclib  
Trilaciclib dosing is not to be modified and will remain at 240 mg/m2 throughout the study. 
Trilaciclib will be administered only on days that chemotherapy is administered except in the 
Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase when monotherapy trilaciclib will be given. Recommendations for 
management of trilaciclib  AESIs are provided in Table  9. 
9.3.2.  Dose Modifications for Chemotherapy  
Doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, and carboplatin dose reductions for hematologic 
toxicities are based on values obtained within [ADDRESS_890950] degree of drug- related toxicity  and are to be 
managed  per Inve stigator discretion and institutional guidelines; recommendations are provided 
in Table  6 and Table  7.

Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 61 9.3.6.  Hy’s Law Management  
Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubi n that 
meet the criteria outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered 
potential cases of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy’s Law cases) and should always be 
considered important medical events.  
Patients who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated furt her to 
determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: 
• Baseline AST or ALT and total bilirubin values are within the normal range and the 
patient subsequently presents with AST or ALT ≥3 × ULN concurrent with a total 
bilirubin ≥2 × ULN with no evidence of hemolysis a nd an alkaline phosphatase 
≤2 × ULN or not available.  
• Pre-existing baseline ALT, AST, OR total bilirubin values are above the ULN, and 
the patient subsequently presents with: 
− AST or ALT ≥2 × baseline value AND ≥3 × ULN, or ≥8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller)  
− concurrent  with total bilirubin ≥2 × baseline value OR ≥3 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).  
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possibl e, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_890955] with a jaundiced patient, surgery, blood transfusion, 
history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further te sting for 
acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (e.g., biliary tract) may be wa rranted. All 
cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria defined a bove, with no other 
cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potent ial Hy’s Law cases 
irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology 
of the abnormal LFTs. Such potential Hy’s Law cases should be reported as serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ). 
9.3.7.  Management of Nausea and Vomiting 
Necessary supportive care (e.g., antiemetics, antidiarrheals) administered p er standard of care at 
the study center will be permitted .  
9.4. Supportive Care Interventions  
9.4.1.  Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor Usage 
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)  should be administered after each cycle of AC 
chemotherapy  or per Investigator discretion. G- CSF 5 μg/kg/day administered subcutaneously 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 62 (SC) should be initiated at [ADDRESS_890956] 72 hours. Pegfilgrastim 
administered SC as e ither a single dose of 100 μg/kg (individualized) or a single dose of 6 mg 
(general approach) at 24 hours after chemotherapy is also acceptable.  
Prophylactic G- CSF use  during treatment with paclitaxel  (with or without carboplatin) is allowed 
per growth factor/neutropenia management guidelines (e.g., American Society of Clinical 
Oncology [ ASCO ]), package inserts, and Investigator discretion  (Aapro , 2011 ; Smith , 2015) . If 
in any cycle a patient experiences febrile neutropenia and /or is at high risk for 
infection -associated c omplications, G- CSF/ granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) should be used to treat the febrile neutropenia event per ASCO guidelines and 
package inserts.  
9.4.2.  Transfusions  
Red Blood Cells 
Based on the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Hematopoietic G rowth Factors 
Version 2.2020 and the AABB Clinical Practice Guidelines, the following RBC transf usion 
thresholds are recommended ( Carson , 2016; Goel , 2018 ); however, the patient’s clinical situation 
should always be the primary guiding factor when deciding to transfuse. 
• Transfusion is not indicated until the hemoglobin level is ≤7 g/dL for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660599] s table.  
• An RBC transfusion threshold of ≤8 g/dL is recommended for patients undergoing 
orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery, and those with preexisting cardiovascular 
disease.  
• Patients with symptomatic anemia should be transfused per Investigator discret ion 
regardless of hemoglobin levels. 
Platelets  
Platelet  transfusion is recommended at a threshold of ≤ 10 x 109/L. Platelets should also be 
transfused in any patient who is bleeding with a platelet count <50 x 109/L (100 x 109/L for 
central nervous system or ocular bleeding) ( Kaufman , 2015 ; Schiffer , 2001). 
9.5. Prior/ Concomitant Medications , Procedures, and Vaccinations   
Medications and Procedures:  
All prior medications  and procedures will be collected from 21 days  prior to signing the ICF. All 
concomitant medications including prescription medications, over- the-counter preparations, 
growth factors, and blood products from informed consent through the End of Study Visit will be 
documented, where possible. The use of gonadotrophin- releasing ho rmone ( GnRH ) agonist 
therapy (e.g., goserelin acetate [Zolodex®]) for ovarian preservation and bisphosphonates  or 
rank ligand inhibitors to prevent osteopenia or osteoporosis is allowed during chemotherapy. 
Administration of other concomitant non-protocol anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660600]. This includes any low-dose systemic chemotherapeutic agent given for a 
non-oncologic purpose (e.g., low-dose methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis). Administra tion of 
other concomitant investigatio nal agents for any indication is not permitted while on this study. 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 63 Any medication that is contraindicated when using doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, 
carboplatin  or pemb rolizumab (when applicable) is not permitted, and warnings and precautions 
for use of these study drugs should be observed.  
Avoid concomitant use with certain OCT2, MATE1, and MATE- 2K substrates where minimal 
concentration changes may lead to serious or life- threatening toxicities  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Any diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedure performed during the study period will be  
documented. Documentation will include information regarding the date(s), indication(s), 
description of the procedure(s), and any clinical or pathological findings, if available .  
Vaccinations:  
All prior vaccinations will be collected from [ADDRESS_890957] dose of study drug or anticipation that 
such a live, attenuated vaccine will be required during the study treatment period is prohi bited. 
Other vaccine types such as inactivated or nucleic acid vaccines (e.g., those given for  COVID-19 
or influenza) are permitted if given at one of these timepoints:  
• > [ADDRESS_890958] be given > [ADDRESS_890959] dose of study 
drug.  
• Between C2D1 of chemotherapy  (after pre -dose blood sample is obtained) and > 21 days 
prior to definitive surgery 
• After definitive  surgery

 64 10. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY TREATMENT AND PATIENT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
10.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Study drugs will be discontinued if any of the following events occur during the study: 
• A patient suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the Investigator, S ponsor, or Medical  
Monitor, presents an unacceptable risk to the patient 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition (e .g., a significant intercurrent 
illness or complication) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, are unacceptable f or 
further administration of study drug 
• Occurrence of pregnancy  in a female patient during the study 
• Significant noncompliance with protocol requirements 
• The Sponsor or legal representative of the Sponsor requests the patient to withdraw 
• If total time between chemotherapy treatments exceeds a total of >4 weeks, unless 
agreed to by [CONTACT_660646]. 
• Where permanent discontinuation of all study drugs is indicated in the toxicity 
management recommendations  (Sectio n 9.3).  
Following study drug discontinuation, a Safety Follow -Up and End of Study Visit should be 
completed with assessments performed as shown in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). The 
Investigator or designee will document the reason for study drug discontinuation on the 
applicable eCRF. When discontinuation is due to a SAE or a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity considered to 
be related to study drug, the Investigator should follow the event until resolution, return to 
baseline, or it is deemed that further recovery is unlikely. Data on these events s hould be 
collected on the AE electronic case report form ( eCRF ). In the event a patient discontinues due 
to pregnancy, the Investigator or designee should notify the M edical Monitor by [CONTACT_155417] 24 hours of pregnancy confirmation (see Section  17.3 ). 
10.2. Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient may withdraw from the study at any time at her own request or may be withdraw n at 
any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative 
reasons. At the time of discontinuing from the study, a Safety Follow-Up and End of Study Visit 
should be completed (if they have not been done already) with assessments performed as show n 
in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  4).  
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may re tain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a patient withdraws from the study, she may request destruction of any samples take n and not 
tested, and the Investigator or designee must document this in the site study records. 
Protocol  G1T28-[ADDRESS_890960] to follow -up (i.e., the patient is unable to be contact[CONTACT_108866]). 
A study site is considered eligible to start participation in the study once all regulat ory approvals 
are in place, site agreement contract is fully executed, and any other required documents a re in 
place as required by [CONTACT_2728].  
The Sponsor reserves the right to close a study site (s) or terminate the study at any time for any 
reason. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when 
all required documents and study supplies have been collected, a study-site closure visit ha s been 
performed, and the site has closed all regulatory activities with the Instituti onal Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC). 
The Investigator may be requested to initiate study-site closure at any time, provided t here is 
reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Should 
this occur with patients receiving study drug , the patients will transition to receive standard of 
care trea tment by [CONTACT_660647]. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_660648]:  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/ IEC or local health authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP ) guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of patients by [CONTACT_737] 
• Discontinuation of further development of trilaciclib 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
Investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract rese arch 
organization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by [CONTACT_660649]. The Investigator shall promptly inform the patient and 
should assure appropriate patient therapy and/or follow-up. 
 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 66 11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS   
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  4). 
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments , is essential and required for study conduct. Immediate safety concerns should be 
discussed with the M edical Monitor upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient 
should continue or discontinue study intervention. 
The Investigator or d esignee will maintain a screening log to record detai ls of all patients 
screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as  applicable.  
Patients who discontinue from the study prior to receiving the first dose of study drug may be 
replaced.  
11.1. Screening Assessments  
The following information for screening failures should be recorded: patient identification , 
demographic data, and reason for failing the screening process. Patients may only be rescre ened 
one time at the discretion of the Investigator . For abnormal laboratory values, a second test to 
confirm the first is permitted ; only the qualifying result should be recorded .  
Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical management (e .g., hematology, 
serum chemistry, baseline diagnostic tissue) and obtained before signing of the ICF ma y be 
utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol- specified 
criteria  and timeframe . 
11.1.1.  ER-, PR-, HER2 -Negative Status  
Eligibility will be based on local ER -negative, PR-negative, HER2- negative statu s from a recent 
tumor biopsy report confirming TNBC  prior to Screening.  
ER/PR-negative status should be histologically or cytologically confirmed by [CONTACT_660650] (defined as <1% nuclei staining) and HER2 non- overexpressin g 
status should be confirmed per 2018 ASCO College of American Pathologists criteria.  
11.1.2.  Baseline Characteristics and Demographics  
Age (year only), sex, race (when reporting is allowed per local regulations), ethnicit y, and 
menopausal status will be collected during the Screening period. 
11.1.3.  Medical and Surgical  History  
Medical and surgical history, including past and current conditions, will be collected. 
Concomitant medications taken from informed consent and vaccinations within [ADDRESS_890961] be thoroughly evaluated by [CONTACT_660651]: date of initial diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, tumor gra de, 
primary tumor location  and type (i.e., single lesion, multi- centric, multifocal), clinical TNM 
staging at baseline, primary and sentinel lymph node biopsies and results, and BRCA 
classification (if availab le). 
Protocol  G1T28-[ADDRESS_890962] on the tumor microenvironment, tumor tissue and blood will be collected. Investigat ions 
may include, but are not limited to:  
1. see Tumor RNA Analyses  
Targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and sequencing in tumor tissue via  
Nano String  technologies will be performed to define longitudinal molecular changes within the 
tumor microenvironment and identify gene sig natures that correlate to clinical response to 
treatment with trilaciclib and the combinations. Trilaciclib induces a response in tumo rs that 
likely reflects an inflamed/immune phenotype. Specific immune -related gene sets (such as those 
capturing interferon-gamma signaling, cytotoxicity, inflammatory chemokines, and antigen 
processing) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual genes rel ated to 
the immune system may also be evaluated (e.g., interleukin -10, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, and 
LAG -3).  
2. Immunohistochemistry using Tumor Tissue 
Tumor samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses via immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) to quantitate cells expressing PD-L1, CD8, and FOXP3, and assess the associ ation with 
response to trilaciclib. Coll ectively, the data will provide insight into the presence and change in 
TIL infiltration from baseline to post -trilaciclib monotherapy, and at surgery.  
3. Immune Profiling of Peripheral Blood 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collection at baseline, on-treatment, and at  surgery will be 
characterized by [CONTACT_660652]. Quantitative assessment of  major immune 
populations and subsets, cytokine production along with qualitative measurement of cell 
activation, maturation, and exhaustion status, and polyfunctionality will provide a 
comprehensive profile of the peripheral blood immune landscape, and the kinetics of the im mune 
response following trilaciclib.  
11.2.1.  Tumor Biops y Collection 
To evaluate the impact of trilaciclib on changes of the tumor-associated immune r esponse in 
TNBC, immunophenotypic changes will be compared in tumor biopsies at three separate 
timepoints  (Table  4):  
1. Screening : baseline tissue is obtained prior to any study treatment 
2. Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase : on-treatment biopsy is obtained 7 (±1) days post single-dose 
administration of monotherapy trilaciclib (prior to initiation of chemotherapy)  
3. Definitive Surgery : in patients who have not achieved a pCR, tissue will be obtained at 
time of  surgery , which  is to occur [ADDRESS_890963] 3 separate tumor cores (ideally ≥ 4), ut ilizing at 
least a  14-gauge needle and multiple passes.  Tumor samples will be analyzed from primary 
tumor in breast, not nodal tissue. For fresh biopsies, cores may be stored in paraf fin blocks or 
embedded in optimal cutting temperature  compound (see laboratory m anual  for details ). 
Protocol  G1T28-[ADDRESS_890964] of representative 
FFPE tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (75-micron) . It is the Investigator’s responsibility to 
confirm there is sufficient baseline tissue prior to first dose. If there is insuf ficient archival tissue, 
a fresh biopsy will be obtained. The patient should not have received any antineoplastic ther apy 
(including systemic therapy or radiation) between the baseline tissue collection a nd first dose of 
study drug. The Sponsor must approve if archival tissue was taken > [ADDRESS_890965] adequate archival tissue may  consent to optional fresh 
biopsy collection at baseline. 
Tumor tissue will be used to analyze immune endpoints including exploratory markers of 
trilaciclib sensitivity such as genomic profiles, mRNA expression, CDK4/[ADDRESS_890966] of trilaciclib on the immune response, immunophenotypic 
changes will be compared from serial peripheral blood samples at four separate timepoints 
(Table  4): 
1. Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase: day of single dose monotherapy trilaciclib  administration 
(pre-dose) 
2. Trilaciclib Lead -In Phase: day of biopsy, prior to  the biopsy procedure and initiation of 
chem otherapy  
3. Treatment Phase: C2D1 of  chemotherapy  (pre-dose)  
4. Definitive Surgery: day of surgery  (prior to surgery); within [ADDRESS_890967] cancer status, pathological staging per current American Joint Committee of 
Cancer (AJCC) Breast Cancer Staging, and assessment of surgical margins w ill be performed by 
[CONTACT_660653]. Remaining tissue will be  used 
for biomarker analysis. 
pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluat ion of 
the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes followi ng 
completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (i.e., ypT0/Tis ypN0 in the current AJCC staging 
system).  
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 69 11.3. Safety Assessments   
Unless specified otherwise, safety assessments should be conducted prior to study drug 
administration.  
11.3.1.  Vital Signs  
The following will be collected per the Schedule of A ssessments  (Table  4): 
• Pulse rate  and blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) 
• Height in centimeters ( Screening  visit only) and body weight in kilograms  
Assessments may be performed by a physician or other qualified health care provider.  
11.3.2.  Physical Examination 
Complete  physical examination at Screening  includes all major body systems , including general 
appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, 
extremities, and neurological examinations. Subsequent symptom- directed physical exams 
should include body systems as appropriate (e.g., limited  physi cian exam  based on symptoms) 
and weight. 
Information about the physical examination must be present in the source documentation at  the 
study site. Clinically relevant findings observed prior  to the start of study drug, should be 
recorded as medical history. Clinically relevant find ings observed after  the start of study drug, 
which meet the definition of an AE, must be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
11.3.3.  ECOG Performance Status  
The Investigator or designee will assess ECOG performance status during the S creening Period 
to assess for eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Table  10).  
Table 10: ECOG Performance Status  
Grade  ECOG 
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre- disease performance without restriction  
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of

Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 70 11.3.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
Hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the sit e’s local 
certified laboratory per the schedule outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  4). A list of 
clinical laboratory tests to be performed is provided in Section  17.1 .  
Hematology may be obtained up to 24 hours and serum chemistry and urinalysis may be 
obtained up to 72 hours prior to each time point on Schedule of Assessments. For women of 
childbearing potential, pregnancy tests will be obtained at Screening and within 72 hours prior to 
chemotherapy treatment  on C1 D1, C5D1 , C11D1, and C16 D1 only using serum  or urine beta 
human chorionic gonadotropin (ß- hCG) . 
Serum chemistry and hematology results shall be reviewed before dosing. Laboratory toxic ities 
will be assessed using the NCI CTCAE v5.0. 
An abnormal laboratory value is not an AE unless it is considered to be clinically signifi cant by 
[CONTACT_737]. Laboratory parameters for which clinically significant v alues are noted will be 
re-measured on the appropriate clinical follow-up arranged by [CONTACT_737]. Any laboratory 
value that remains abnormal at the end of the study and that is considered clinically s ignificant 
should be followed according to accepted medical standards for up to 30 days or until the values 
return  to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_11856]. 
If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable  by [CONTACT_3786], the etiology should be identified, and the Medical Monitor notified.  
If a subsequent cycle is delayed for toxicity, the patient should still complete the c linical 
laboratory assessments on the scheduled Day 1 (entered as an Unscheduled assessment  in the 
eCRF) as well as on the actual first dosing day of that cycle. If the delay is secondar y to 
hematologic toxicity, weekly repeat hematology assessments should continue until the finding 
meets criteria for resumption of dosing (see Section  9.2). 
11.3.5.  Electrocardiogram  
Standard  12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) will be performed  at Screening (Table  4). 
Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated at any  time during the study. A ll 
12-lead ECG s will be obtained after the patient has been resting for at least 10 minutes in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_660601] 25 mm/sec .  
Any ECG with a QTc value of >[ADDRESS_890968] t he QTc value confirmed via manual read . 
Following confirmation, the Investigator should follow institutional guidelines for the 
appropriate dose modifications based on the grade of QTc prolongation and evaluate for any  
other potential causes of the prolongation (e.g. , concomitant medications).  
The Investigator or designee w ill review the ECGs locally . 
11.3.6.  Echocardiogram or MUGA  
An ECHO  or MUGA scan will be performed at Screening to evaluate adequate cardiac function  
and determine eligibility (Table  4). The assessment method will be at the Investigator’s 
discretion and per local standard of care.  Additional assessments  may be performed as clinically 
indicated at any time during the study. I f repeat cardiac assessments are necessary, the method 
(ECHO or MUGA) should be the same throughout the study.  
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 71 11.3.7.  Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
Study- procedure related SAEs  will be collected after the informed consent form is signed ; all 
AEs will be col lected starting from the first dose of study drug through the End of Study Visit . 
Any AE, either directly or indirectly related to biopsy procedures, surgery , or the medication 
required to perform surgery and its sequelae should be reported. Toxicity will be assess ed by 
[CONTACT_660654] v5.0. 
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recordi ng 
events that mee t the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up, as 
applicable, AEs that are serious, considered related to the study drugs or study procedures, or  
that caused the patient to discontinue the study or study drugs (see Section 10.1). Patients should 
be encouraged to report AEs freely or in response to general, nondirected questioning. Adverse 
events (serious and non-serious) should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF from 
the first dose of study treatment through last patient visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse and Serious Adverse Event 
Information 
AEs will be collected starting from the first dose of  study drug through the End of Study Visit. 
Any SAE occurring between the date the patient signs informed consent and the first dose of a ny 
study drug, and which the I nvestigator feels is related to a study specific procedure (i.e.,  would 
not have occurred  unless the patient was on the study), should also be reported. Any AEs that 
occur between the date of signing informed consent and the first dose of study drug should be 
recorded as Medical History.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to G1 Therapeutics , Inc Pharmacovigilance (PVG) or 
designee immediately and should not exceed [ADDRESS_890969] promptly notify G1 Therapeutics , Inc.  PVG or designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Method of Detecting Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 17.2.  
Care should be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow- up of Adverse and Serious Advers e Events  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively fo llow each patient at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs (both serious and nonserious) will be followed in acc ordance 
with good medical practice until resolution, return to baseline, or it is deemed that fur ther 
recovery is unlikely. All measures required for AE management and the ultimate outc ome of the 
Protocol  G1T28-[ADDRESS_890970] to follow -up (as defined in Section  10.3 ). Further information on follow-up 
procedures is provided in Section  17.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification of G1 Therapeutics , Inc.  PVG or designee by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) 
of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards th e safety of 
patients and the safety of a study intervention under clinical invest igation are met.  
G1 Therapeutics , Inc.  has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical inves tigation. G1 
Therapeutics , Inc.  will comply with coun try-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, Central IRB/IEC, and Investigators. For all studies, except 
those utilizing medical devices, Investigator safety reports must be prepared f or suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirem ents and 
G1 Therapeutics , Inc.  policy and forwarded to Investigators, as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE or other  specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from G1 Therapeutics , Inc.  or designee 
will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will noti fy the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female patients will be collected after the start of stu dy intervention 
and until [ADDRESS_890971] dose of study drug. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator or designee should inform G1 Therapeutics , Inc.  PVG 
or designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures 
outlined in Section  17.3 . 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abor tion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
11.3.8.  Definitive Surgery

Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 74 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to any ana lysis that will be 
performed for this study. While the SA P will include more details related to the statistical 
analyses for data collected from this study, this section is a summary of the key aspec ts of the 
planned statistical analyses.  
12.1. Sample Size Determination  
Sample size justification is based off of previo usly published data on the CD8+/Treg ratio from 
early stage TNBC patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( Ahn, 2020) . Using a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05, and anticipating that 10% patients enrolled to this study wi ll 
not have paired data (resulting in 27 patients with paired data), the power of the study to det ect a 
respective mean of paired difference  in CD8 +/Tregs ratio u sing paired Wilcoxon signed-rank 
tests has been calculated using PASS 2019 (v19.0.3), and is presented in the t able below.  
Mean of Paired Difference  in CD8 +/Tregs  Power  
1.8 72% 
2.0 81% 
2.3 90% 
2.5 94% 
Based on the assumption of an estimated standard deviation of paired differences of 3.4. 
12.2. Analysis Population  
The Full Analysis Set - 1 (FAS1) population includes enrolled patients who have received 
trilaciclib during the Trilaciclib Lead -in Phase. This dataset will be used to assess immune 
response in tumor tissue. 
The Full Analysis Set – 2 (FAS2) population incl udes enrolled patients who have received at 
least one  dose of a study drug during the Treatment Phase of the study. This dataset will be used 
to assess safety and tolerability and the rate of pCR for trilaciclib in combination w ith 
neoadjuvant systemic the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
12.3. Statistical Analysis Methods  
12.3.1.  General Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® v9.[ADDRESS_890974] deviations, 25% and 75% percentiles, 
and minimum and maximum values by [CONTACT_1570]. For the immune- response measures and 
other biomarkers, median will be used to present the central point of the population been stud ied.  
12.3.2.  Patient Disposition  
Patient disposition will be summarized for all patients. The summary will include numbe r of all 
screened patients, and number and percentage of patients who were enrolled and received study 
drug, discontinued from each study drug and reasons, and discontinued from study and reasons.  
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 75 12.3.3.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized. The summary wi ll include age, 
age groups, gender, race, ethnicity, screening vital signs, ECOG status, region, and baseline 
disease characteristics.  
12.3.4.  Study Drug Exposure, Modification and Dose Intensity  
Duration of study drug exposure will be defined for each chemotherapy drug (doxorubicin, 
cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pembrolizumab, as applicable ) and for trilaciclib.  
The number of cycles that patients have received will be summarized by [CONTACT_660655] e statistics as 
a continuous variable, while the number of cycles that are completed will be summ arized as a 
categorical variable.  
Study drug modifications will be summarized in three categories: chemotherapy dose reduction, 
cycle delay, and infusion interruption. The number and percentage of patients who have any 
chemotherapy dose reduction or delay  and have at least one dose reduction or delay  for a 
particular chemotherapy will be summarized along with a summary of the number of dos e 
reductions or delays for each chemotherapy; the number and percentage of patients who have  at 
least one infusion interruption for trilaciclib , any chemotherapy, or pembrolizumab (if 
applicable)  will be summarized along with a summary of the number of interruptions. Lastly, the 
primary reason for each form of study drug modification (chemotherapy dose reductions , cycle 
delay,  and infusion interruption) will als o be summarized.  
For trilaciclib,  doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, carboplatin and pembrolizumab 
cumulative dose, dose intensity, relative dose, and relative dose intensity will be deri ved and 
summarized . 
12.3.5.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analyses for Primary I mmune -Response Measure  
Summary statistics for primary immune -response measure, the ratio of CD8 + TIL over FOXP3+ 
regulatory T cells (abbreviated as CD8 +/Tregs), will be provided for measures taken at baseline 
(pre-trilaciclib), 7 ± 1 days after single dose trilaciclib (post- trilaciclib), and the change scores 
(post minus pre). Median will be used as the central point with Q1 and Q3 as the measure of 
sprea d. The significance of the magnitude of change will be tested by [CONTACT_660610]-
Rank test. Analyses on the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS1 population. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analyses for pCR   
For the clinical efficacy endpoint, pCR rate will be reported with a 95% confidence interval 
using the Clopper- Pearson method  based on FAS2 population. In addition, patients will be 
dichotomized by [CONTACT_660611]8+/Tregs ratio, and pCR rate will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_660656]. The association 
between pCR status and high/low in ratio change will be tested using a Chi- square test. These 
analyses will be performed on the FAS2 population.  
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 76 12.3.6.  Safety Analyses  
For trilaciclib alone, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_660613]- in Phase 
based on FAS1 population. For trilaciclib in combination with other systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], sa fety 
and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_2695], dose modification, laboratory tests, vita l signs, and 
ECGs based on FAS2 population. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
Adverse events are defined as those events occurring or worsening after treatme nt has begun on 
this study. Adverse event data will be coded to system organ class and preferred term usi ng the 
latest version of Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). The severity (toxicity 
grades 1 -5) of AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 by [CONTACT_431]. 
The number and percentage of patients experiencing any AE overall, and by [CONTACT_9313] , 
preferred t erm and CTCAE grade will be tabulated. Adverse events considered by [CONTACT_660657] (e.g., trilaciclib or each 
chemotherapy). Severity of AEs will be tabulated based on greatest severity obser ved for e ach 
patient. In the tabulation of grade and causality, if the same AE occurs on multiple oc casions, the 
highest grade and strongest relationship to study drug will be used. AESIs for trilaciclib, AEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation or study drug modi fication will be summarized by [CONTACT_29974] , preferred term  and CTCAE grade, as appropriate. Concomitant medications will be 
coded to Anatomical Therapeutic Classification using the World Health Organizat ion-Drug 
Dictionary (WHO- DD) and summarized .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Other Safety Endpoints  
Observed values and changes from baseline in laboratory assessments of hematology a nd 
chemistry parameters, vital signs, and ECG parameters will be summarized for  each scheduled 
visit at which the assessment is taken. Changes from baseline to the maximum and minimum 
values during treatment will also be summarized.   
Clinical  chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters will be characterized according t o 
CTCAE toxicity grade from [ADDRESS_890975], the 
maximum grade will be reported.  
For vital sig ns and ECG parameters , potentially clinically significant (PCS) findings will be 
summarized. The potentially clinically significant vital signs and ECG measures  are defined 
either by [CONTACT_447]- baseline assessment or by [CONTACT_660658] t he pre-
specified thresholds. The criteria defining PCS for vital signs and ECG parameters will be 
detailed in the study SAP.

Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 87 17.2. Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, and Follow -up 
17.2.1.  Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study pati ent, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered rel ated to the study 
intervention. 
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorm al 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally as sociated with the use 
of study in tervention. 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, serum chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (e .g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those tha t worsen 
from baseline, considered clinically significant  and require clinical intervention or further 
investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test)  in the medical and scientific judgment 
of the Investigator (i .e., not related to progression of underlying disease)  unless they are associated 
with an already reported clinical event, e.g. elevated liver enzymes in a pat ient with jaundice. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensit y of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even  though it may 
have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either s tudy intervent ion or a 
concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE un less it is an 
intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent . Such overdoses should be 
reported regardless of sequelae.  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE D efinition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal sa fety assessments 
which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator to be more 
severe than expected for the patient’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or sympt oms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the pa tient’s condition. 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e .g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at 
the start of the study that do not worsen. 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 88 17.2.2.  Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditi ons 
are met (e .g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease). 
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in whic h the patient was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically  might have caused 
death, if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660602], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329887] (u sually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or t reatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complica tions that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217610], 
the event is serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is 
not considered an AE. 
4. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s abili ty to conduct normal life 
functions. 
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively mi nor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accid ental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life funct ions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption. 
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SA E reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that ma y not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660603] l isted in the above 
definition. These events should usually be considered serious. 
• Examples of such events include invas ive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 89 17.2.3.  Recording and Follow- Up of AE and/or SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the I nvestigator to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) relat ed to the event. 
• The Investig ator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_113502]’s medical records to G1 
Therapeutics , Inc. (or designee) in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE e CRF page  or Paper SAE 
Report Form. 
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_660604] 
G1 Therapeutics , Inc. (or designee). In this case, all patient identifiers, with the exception of  the 
patient number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] o f the medical records before submission to G1 
Therapeutics  Inc. (or designee).  
• The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event base d on signs, symptoms, and/or 
other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the indivi dual signs/symptoms) 
will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
• All SAEs should be reported  to G1  Therapeutics , Inc. PVG (or designee) within 24 hours of 
notification on a n SAE  Form  in the eCRF . Any relevant source data related to the SAE should also 
be emailed or faxed to G1 Therapeutics , Inc. PVG (or designee):

Fax: +1 -[PHONE_13668] 
Assessment of Intensity  
Intensity will be assessed using NCI -CTCAE v5.0 criteria, as follows: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; l imiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living.  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically signific ant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self- care activities of daily living.  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 90 AE and SAE Recording  
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study inter vention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE  (Related or Not Related); i.e., is there a “reasonable possibility” the 
study intervention caused the event (yes/no) . 
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, e vidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relations hip cannot be ruled out. 
• The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and o ther risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention admin istration will be 
considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for markete d products, in 
his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator must  document in the medical notes that she has reviewed the 
AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the I nvestigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to G1 Therapeutics, Inc. PVG  (or designee). However, it 
is very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of c ausality for every event 
before the initial transmission of the SAE data to G1 Therapeutics, Inc. PVG  (or designee).  
• The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]- up information and 
send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory r eporting 
requirements.  
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplementa l measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by G1 Therapeutics , Inc. PVG  (or 
designee ; SAEs only ) to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possi ble. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopath ological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals. 
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF.  
• The Investigator will submit any  new or  updated SAE data on the paper SAE Report Form to G1 
Therapeutics , Inc. PVG  (or designee) within 24 hours of receipt of the information:

Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 91 17.2.4.  Reporting of SAEs 
SAE Reporting to G1 Therapeutics (or designee) via an Electronic Data Collection Tool 
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to G1 Therapeutics (or designe e) will be the 
electronic data collection tool (EDC).  
• If the electronic system  is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE Report Form in or der to 
report the event within 24 hours via email or fax (see below for SAE repor ting contact 
[CONTACT_3031]).  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes a vailable.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line 
to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study patient or receives  updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the 
site should report this information on a paper SAE Report form or notify t he Medical Monitor by 
[CONTACT_756].

Protocol  G1T28-[ADDRESS_890985]-menopausal unles s 
permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear (e .g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes), additional evaluation should be 
considered. 
Women in the following categories are not considered Woman of Childbearing Potential 
1. Premenarchal  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the patient’s medi cal 
records, medical examination, or medical history interv iew. 
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following acceptable surgical sterilization 
techniques: complete or partial hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation , or occlusion with 
surgery at least [ADDRESS_890986] 
2 months prior to dosing. 
3. Postmenopausal female: defined as spontaneous amenorrhea for >12 months prior to 
Screening  without alternative cause (e .g., implantable contraceptive, side effect of 
medication, etc .) and a serum follicle stimulating horm one ( FSH) within the laboratory’s 
reference range for postmenopausal females.  
• Women taking hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) must discontinue HRT at least 
2-4 weeks prior to Screening for accurate assessment of FSH (though exact interval 
will depend on the type and dosage of HRT and should be determined by [CONTACT_1268]). 
Contraception Guidance  
Contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of 
contraception for those participating in clinical studies.  
• All fe males of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine  β-hCG test 
result at Screening  and on Day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle.  
• Females must be either postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or agree to use 
[ADDRESS_890987] 
dose of study drug. Acceptable forms of contraception include: 
− Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception 
(stable dose at least 3 months prior to dosing) 
− Intrauterine device or intrauterine system  
− Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. Barrier  
methods alone (without spermicide) are not acceptable methods. Likewise, 
spermicide alone is not an acceptable method  
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 93 − Male sterilization prior to Screening  with the appropriate post- vasectomy 
documentation (absence of sperm in the ejaculate 6 months after procedure). The 
vasectomized male partner s hould be the sole partner for the patient  
− True abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. Periodic abstinence (e .g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception 
• For patients who are exclusively in same-sex relationships, contraceptive 
requirements do not apply. If a patient who is in a same- sex relationship at the time of 
signing the ICF becomes engaged in a heterosexual relationship, they must agree to 
use contraception as described previously. If a patient who is abstinent at the time of  
signing the ICF becomes sexually active, they must agree to use contraception as 
described above.  
In addition, patients are to comply with the following guidelines: 
• Contraceptive use is required for the duration of the study and for at least [ADDRESS_890988] dose of study drug. 
Collection of Pregnancy Information 
• The Investigator or designee will collect pregnancy information on any female patient 
who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial Information will 
be recorded on the Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form ( Pregnancy  – Initial 
Report Form) and submitted to G1 PVG or designee within 24 hours of learning of a 
patient’s pregnancy within 24 hours of learning of a patient’s pregnancy.  
• The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator or designee will collect follow -up information on the patient and the 
neonate and the information will be collected on the Pregnancy – Follow-up Report 
Form and forwarded to G1 Therapeutics , Inc. PVG or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 12 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (pres ence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregna ncy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 weeks 
gestational age) or still birth (occurring at >22 weeks gestational age) is alwa ys 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post-study pregnancy 
related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by [CONTACT_660663] G1 Therapeutics , Inc. PVG or designee . While the 
Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study patient s, 
he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
Protocol  G1T28-212 
Version 2.0 dated 23 Mar 2022 
 94 • Any female patient who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention.

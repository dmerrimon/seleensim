 2.0 INTRODUCTION  and BACKGROUND  
End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)  is a significant and growing health problem .  In the [LOCATION_002] (U .S.), 
571,[ADDRESS_943910] s underw ent treatment in 2009; and since 2000, a 12% increase in the incidence rate of 
ESRD has been observed in subject s ≥ [ADDRESS_943911] s 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_695777], each lasting 3 -4 hours.  An arteriovenous (AV) 
vascular acces s is needed to remove blood for dialysis filtration and return to the body. The access must provide 
high blood flow volume continuously during treatment. Due to the need for surgical healing and development, the 
access is ideally prepared several weeks or months in advance of anticipated need.  A significant challenge in 
managing ESRD  subject s is providing  access when needed, along with consistent and sustained access.  
 
Vascular access has frequently been referred to as the “Achilles heel” of dialysis because of the high morbidity 
and mortality rates due to infection, thrombosis and ultimate access failure. Of the three types of vascular access: 
fistulas, grafts, and central venous catheters, the type used is influenced by [CONTACT_695794] ’s vasculature. While fistulas are considered as the gold 
stand ard, synthetic grafts are also widely used since fistulas cannot always be successfully established.2  The 
failure rate of fistulas to mature and thus be suitable for dialysis may be as high as 60%.3 Many patients  will 
require an AV graft (AVG) access at some point during the disease course.[ADDRESS_943912] techniques.  Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene 
(ePTFE) is the most common graft materi al.4 Novel self -sealing multilayered ePTFE configurations and other 
graft materials (e.g., polyurethane) have recently been introduced, offering the potential for earlier access.10,[ADDRESS_943913] a greater incidence of  recurrent stenosis, especially a t the venous 
anastomosis,  and require more salvage interventions to maintain patency for dialysis.4  The pathogenesis of 
venous stenosis is comprised of a cascade of events resulting in endot helial and smooth muscle injury that results 
in intimal hyperplasia and ultimately flow limiting occlusion.12  With the conventional end -to-side venous 
anastomosis, the vessel wall is subjected to turbulen t, nonlinear flow and low shear stress at the toe and heel of 
the anastomosis, sites that correspond to the development of intimal hyperplasia.  As hyperplasia progresses, 
increasing stenosis occurs resulting in  a decrease in blood flow, leading to thrombosis. In addition to these 
hemodynamic factors, the trauma of surgical graft implantation due to relatively large (3 -6cm) incision sites and 
circumferentially sutured anastomoses, contributes to increased healing time and possible complications.  These 
findings point to the need for new devices and techniques to optimize AV G flow dynamics and healing, resulting 
in the reduction of stenosis and other complications.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_695778], a large percentage of patients  present with an urgent need for hemodialysis and lack sufficient 
time to allow a fistula or standard surgical graft to be firmly established.  In such cases, the use of temporary 
venous catheter access is the only option currently available . More than 80% of subject s will begin dialysis with a 
catheter and approximately 28% will use a catheter for permanent access.[ADDRESS_943914] established a goal to 
limit chronic catheter use to less than 10% of dialysis patients .2,13 
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 7 of 32 
 While recognizing that a native fistula is the recommended access for hemodialysis, AV Gs remain a frequently 
used access type.  The InterGraft ™ Venous Anastomotic Connector (VIG) was developed for minimally invasive 
venous anastomosis of a standard hemodialysis graft.   This study will evaluate the safety and performance of the 
VIG for anastomosis of a commercially available, 6 mm diameter, ePTFE hemodialysis graft.  Anastomoses with 
the VIG may potentially  reduce venous vessel trauma,  improve the local vessel wall shear stresses and promote 
laminar flow, thereby [CONTACT_695795].    
 
The original investigational InterGraft Clinical Study conducted under the approved IDE #G140221 was 
configured as  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], prospective, multicenter, non -randomized, adaptive design .  The study was intended to 
enroll up to [ADDRESS_943915] 52 subjects receiving treatment 
with the VIG +AIG were enrolled and follow -up was completed.   
 
Investigator feedback, safety data and device performance data (number and type of reported device 
malfunctions) from the first 52 subjects treated with a VIG and AIG (interim analysis population)  were evaluated 
and the results were used to inform the modified study design described in  the previous revision 6 of the 
Investigational Plan .  
 
With this current Investigational Plan, t he study primary analysis population  will now include the following:   
 
• All [LOCATION_003] subjects enrolled since June 5, 2018 and treated with the VIG + sutured arterial 
anastomosis  (These subjects were not included in the interim analysis.)  
 
• All [LOCATION_003] VIG sub -study subjects enrolled after October 17, 2017  (These subjects were not 
included in the interim analysis.)  
 
Roll-in subjects, subjects who were included in the planned interim analysis  that has previously been completed , 
and other subjects that received an AIG will not be included in the primary analysis population. However, these 
subjects will continue to be followed and evaluated according to the requirements of the current  protocol, which 
are identical to the previous  version  protocol requirements , and these results will also be included in a final study 
report.  
 
The current  study will evaluate  use of the VIG for placement of an AV G. The venous anastomosis will be created 
using the VIG and the arterial anastomosis will be created using standard suturing. The study focuses on subjects 
who have a failed fistula, cannot have a fistula , or are better suited for an AV G, as determined by [CONTACT_099]. 
The graft implant procedural outcomes, the number and type of major adverse events, and patency throug hout a 
six (6) month follow -up period will be evaluated.  The 6 -month patency rate will be compared with a pre -
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.

 specified patency performance goal that is drawn from prior surgical AV G literature and published performance 
standards.10, 14-20 
 
This study will be conducted  in compliance with the Investigational Plan , Investigational Device Exemption 
(IDE) regulations, Good Clinica l Practice  guidelines (GCP) , and other applicable  regulatory requirements.   The 
study Sponsor (Phraxis, Inc.) intends that  the study results  will support a 510(k) marketing clearance for the 
InterGraft Venous Anastomotic Connector.   
 
3.0 STUDY DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
 
The device evaluated in the study is the InterGraft ™ Venous Anastomotic Connector  (VIG). The VIG is designed 
for transcatheter delivery within a vein and connection to a n AVG  that has been tunneled under the skin in a 
standard manner. The connection  is made via a small skin incision.  
 
The VIG is constructed with a nitinol framework encapsulated with ePTFE in the midsection and uncoated at the 
ends ( Figure 1 ). The VIG is delivered and deployed within the target ve in using a customized transcatheter 
delivery system. The VIG is a flexible, flar ed, self -expanding endoprosthesis designed for coaxial placement in 
peripheral veins up to 10 mm in diameter. The distal flared end is configured as a nitinol scaffold with anchoring 
barbs that extend into the vein wall. The ‘graft end’ of the VIG is configured as a stent -like framework for 
anchorin g within the  ePTFE  graft.  The materials used  in constructing the  VIG are all medical -grade with well -
established biocompatibility profiles.  
 
The VIG is supplied pre -mounted within a customized transcatheter  delivery system  for over -the-wire delivery 
via a n 11F vascular sheath. The VIG is intended as a permanent implant. The delivery system is a sterile, single 
use, disposable item.  A detailed description of the VIG and  delivery system is provided in the Instructions for 
Use ( Appendix A ). 
Indication  for Use  
The InterGraft ™ Venous Anastomotic Connector provides a minimally invasive, sutureless method for 
attachment of an arteriovenous graft to a vein in the upper extremity.   The InterGraft ™ Venous Anastomotic 
Connector facilitates creation of the arteriovenous graft connection to a vein in support of hemodialysis in patients 
with End Stage Renal Disease. The InterGraft ™ Venous Anastomotic  Connector is intended to be used together 
with conventional suturing of the arterial anastomosis to facilitate creation of an arteriovenous graft in support of 
hemodialysis in patients with End Stage Renal Disease.

 4.0 PRIOR STUDIES  
 
Both the VIG and an arterial InterGraft Connector (AIG) were evaluated i n the prior testing  and studies described 
below.  The findings from the prior testing are also applicable to use of the VIG  only.  The AIG will not be used in 
the current study . 
 
Bench Testing    
Bench testing of the VIG confirmed the structural integrity of the device, adequacy of resistance to compressive 
forces and radial forces, adequacy of bond strengths, kink and migration resistance, and verification of critical 
dimensions.  Where applicable, testing was  conducted using commercial 6mm ePTFE grafts (C.R. Bard, Inc., 
Murray Hill, NJ) that were selected due to their current widespread clinical use.  
 
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)  modeling of the VIG used together with AIG was performed , based on a 6 
mm graft connecting artery and vein.21 This modeling demonstrated resulting graft flows of approximately 1 
L/min when the AV pressure d ifference was approximately 100 mm Hg.  With  graft flow rates ranging from 980 -
1100 ml/min, the maximum wall shear ranged from 265Pa - 180Pa, and thus below the threshold to cause 
mechanical hemolysis (800Pa), or that thought to stimulate hyperplasia.[ADDRESS_943916] to the ability to access, deploy and withdraw.  
 
Acute animal studies evaluated the deliverability of the VIG, the ability to complete an AV circuit using PTFE 
grafts, and near-term graft patency  following initial placeme nt of grafts using a VIG and AIG .22 Testing was 
performed using a femoral ar tery/vein canine model .  These studies provided ev idence of safety and acceptable 
performance of  the VIG. 
 
Clinical Studies  
First-in-Human Study  
A first -in-human clinical evaluation of the  InterGraft Venous and Arterial Connectors  was perform ed.23   The 
InterGraft Connectors were successfully used in 9/9 subjects for connection of an AV G in the upp er arm: [ADDRESS_943917] sutured arterial anastomosis.  InterGraft ™ delivery and deployment success was obtained in all cases. 
All AVGs were patent at the end of the procedure.  
AIG Adverse events occurred during the procedure in 3 subjects: (i) In one case, a successfully deployed AIG was 
inadvertently nicked with a surgical tool during closure of the incision site. This resulted in a hole in the ePTFE 
coating on the AIG, creating a blood leak path that could not be repaired. The AIG was removed and a sutured 
arterial anastomosis was prepared at the same arteriotomy site.  There were no further sequelae. (ii) In another 
case, an acute graft occlusion occurred during the graft impl ant procedure.  Angiographic examination showed 
that the tunneled graft had been positioned in a manner that caused a graft kink. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_695779] a 
guide catheter was performed, the graft was re -positioned to relieve the kink, and graft flow was immediately 
restored. There were no further sequelae. (iii) In another case, persistent bleeding at the AIG arteriotomy site 
occurred and was attributed to an incomplete seal around the arteriotomy site.  The cause was not determined but 
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943918] after discharge: the subject had 
peritonitis and required abdominal surgery (not related to the study device). The subject developed a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -
acquired infection and the graft subsequently became infected and was removed. Of the 8 remaining 
subjects/grafts, 7 were confirmed to be patent at one month following the implant procedure (primary patency). In 
the remaining subject, the one month follow -up has not yet been performed.  
 
Investigator Feedback Collected During Enrollment of the F irst 52 S ubjects in the I DE G140221 Clinical Study  
As originally designed, the  IDE G140221 clinical stu dy inclu ded both an arterial InterGraft Connector  (AIG)  and 
a venous InterGraft connector  (VIG) . Investigator feedback collected during enrollment of the first 52 subjects 
indicated the following:  
 
• A high level surgical/interventional skill was needed for AIG delivery and deployment ; 
• Identifying subjects with a target artery suitable for using the AIG was a key obstacle to enrollment ;  
• The anatomic requirements needed for proper positioning of the AIG relative to the artery orientation, to 
avoid kinks and untoward stresses to the implanted device  were also obstacles to enrollment;  
• Investigators  noted  that while the AIG can work, the current design/procedure is complex and not ready 
for widespread adoption ;  
• Several investigators appear ed to have become disinterested in the study  due to the above noted 
challenges , as evidenced by a very slow recruitment rate.  
 
Based on  this investigator f eedback , Phraxis determined that the AIG in the present configuration with a relatively 
complex delivery and deployment procedure, is excessively challenging to use, and that even if cleared -to-market, 
the AIG would likely not be readily adopted by [CONTACT_15098] . Thus, Phraxis concluded that the AIG is not ready for 
commercial introduction and Phraxis decided  to stop further study of the AIG.  On August 9, 2018, investigators 
were notified to stop further study of the AIG, and to continue follow -up to 6 months in subjects that had 
previously received an AIG, in accordance with the investigational plan.  
 
5.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE  
 
The objective of the current study is to demonstrate that the 6 -month cumulative patency of AVGs connected wit h 
the InterGraft ™ VIG connector  is similar to that of AVGs  connected using standard sutured anastomoses.

8.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is cumulative patency at 6 months, defined as the p ercentage of subjects free from loss of 
access of the study graft for hemodialysis, assessed at 6 months.   
  
Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints for the study include:  
1. Acute device success, defined as AV graft flow at the end of the procedure  as determined by [CONTACT_695797] /or audible bruit, without significant bleeding or emergent surgery . 
Primary Unassist ed Patency at [ADDRESS_943926] graft cannulation . 
3. Number  and type  of interventions required to maintain secondary patency  
4. Number and type of  serious adverse events (SAEs)  through 6 months .  SAEs include the following : death, 
emergent surgery, infection requiring treatment (e.g., prolonged or intravenous antibiotic therapy), significant 
bleeding (defined as bleeding requiring treatment) , and pseudoaneurysm.    
 
Expected interventions for restoration of patency will be documented and reported separately, are reflecte d in the 
evaluation of cumulative  patency, and will not be tabulated again as SAEs.  
 
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 13 of 32 
 Endpoints will be evaluated acutely (at the time of implant), at time of any AVG intervention , at two weeks, and 
monthly through 6 months for all subjects.  The study AV G patency evaluation starts immediately after the index 
procedure is completed (e.g., subject  leaves the surgery suite).  This means that once the AV G is created, patency 
evaluation begins.  The occurrence of acute thrombus  and treatment thereof during the index  procedure while the 
vascular access is being created does not trigger the loss of primary patency.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_943927]  about the study’s purpose and should obtain written 
informed consent.  
 
Final e nrollment  eligibility  is determined at the time of surgery, after the physician has confirmed the final 
inclusion criterion is m et.  Enrolled subjects will be assigned a unique study subject identification number. Each 
study site will maintain screening and enrollment logs to record all subjects who were screened and all subjects 
who were enrolled.  Reason for screen failures will be recorded.  Screening log data will not be included in the 
primary database but will be reviewed during study monitoring . 
 
No clinical site  may contribute  more than 25% of the total enrollment  (excluding roll -in subjects) .       
Baseline I maging  
Angiographic or ultrasonic imaging  of the target limb  vasculature  is routinely performed as part of determining 
the optimal AV access plan  for a subject . As part of subject  screening, baseline imaging should be reviewed to 
determine whether the subject  meets the following criteria  (as determined by [CONTACT_099])  for use of the  VIG:   
• General : Flow rate must be adequate for the creation of dialysis access, as previously mapped with 
ultrasound or angiography  
• Vein inner diameter at planned anastomosis site is 4 -7 mm  in luminal diameter  
• Artery inner diameter at planned anastomosis site is at least 3.[ADDRESS_943928]  
(or their legal representative , if applicable ) must sign the consent form prior to initiation of study procedures. The 
consent form must have been previously approved by [CONTACT_3452]’s IRB.  Failure to provide consent renders the 
subject  ineligible for the study.  Subjects will be given a copy of the signed informed consent document. The 
signed informed consent will be retained with the study records at the site.  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to assure that informed consent is obtained from each subject in accordance with the guidelines of the 
IRB and all applicable regulatory guidelines.

 10.0 STUDY  PROCEDURE  
 
The procedure will be performed in accordance with the Instructions for Use  (IFU)  provided with the study device  
(Appendix A ).   A commercially available 6mm diameter synthetic graft will be used. Such grafts may include 
conventional ePTFE grafts or grafts designed for early cannulation (within 24 -48 hours). The study procedure will 
be performed in an operating room that has fluoroscopic imaging capability for guiding placement of the VIG.  
The anesthesia regimen will be determine d at the physician’s discretion;  there are no study -specific anesthesia 
requirements. A regional nerve block is typi[INVESTIGATOR_695780] G.  Standard, r outine 
hemodynamic monitoring will be performed to assess cardiovascular status throughout the procedure . Heparin 
anticoagulation may be provided at the physician’s discretion.  
 
Small skin incisions will be made for tunneling the graft under the skin in a standard manner.   The VIG device  is 
provided pre -loaded within a customized catheter -based delivery system for over -the-wire delivery.  The VIG is 
inserted through  an introducer sheath placed in the target vein  so that th e ‘vessel end’ of the  VIG is  deployed 
within the ve in, and the ‘graft end’ extend s out of the ve in for connection to the graft.  Delivery and deployment 
will be performed under fluoroscopic guidance. The VIG will be deployed first, connected t o the AV G, then  the 
graft  and VIG  will be flushed and clamped. The arterial anastomosis will then be created using a standard suturing 
method.  
 
NOTE: Although not expected, in the event that connection of the venous graft segment  using the VIG is 
attempted but not able to be completed, the venous anastomosis should be completed using standard suturing. 
Such situations will be considered as a procedure failure.  
 
Following e stablishment of the AV circuit, the skin incisions will be sutured clo sed using standard techniques. 
The subject  will be moved to a recovery area for monitoring  prior to  discharge. It is anticipated that most subjects 
will be discharged the same day or within 24 hours following the AVG  implant procedure.  
Use of C lamps  
To avoid mechanical damage or disruption to the  AVG or VIG, surgical clamps  or other tools with teeth or other 
sharp features  should not be used during the AVG  implant procedure .  An  atraumatic or guarded (e.g ., rubber) 
clamp should be used for clampi[INVESTIGATOR_695781] , as needed .  Do not clamp or manipulate the VIG with surgical tools. 
Use only gentle pi[INVESTIGATOR_695782].  
 
Othe r Treatment Immediately after D eployment  of the VIG  
It is anticipated that no other interventional treatments will be required during the implant procedure.  At the 
venous anastomotic site, no further treatment should be provided if the luminal diameter is > 90% of the adjacent 
normal vessel , based on operator’s assessment .  If the luminal diameter is <90%, balloon angioplasty may be 
performed  as follows:  
 
After deployment, the nitinol -reinforced VIG may be smoothed and more fully seated against the vessel wall by 
[CONTACT_695798]. Balloon treatment should be performed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions , by a physician skilled in peripheral vascular interventional techniques . The balloon diameter used 
should be equal to that of the VIG diameter and should be no larger than 6mm when used to treat the VIG 
segment that is within the  AVG . The balloon should be inflated within the VIG alo ng the entire length.   Multiple 
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 15 of 32 
 inflations may be needed. To avoid possible displacement of the VIG, the physician should assure that the balloon 
is fully deflated prior to carefully removing the balloon.  
 
Vascular G raft for Hemodialysis   
Vascular grafts that meet the following requirements, as determined by [CONTACT_099], may be used:  commercially 
available, straight (not -tapered), [ADDRESS_943929], then immediately followed with the study  procedure.   The patient may be enrolled if, as assessed 
by [CONTACT_093], the central stenosis has <30% residual stenosis, which is the KDOQI threshold for successful 
intervention.  The patient should not be enrolled if the residual stenosis is >= 30% or if the investigator 
determines that the treatment could impact the ability to assess the study endpoints  (e.g., acute device  success, 
graft patency, safety).  
Study Device Failure, Defect, or Suspected Device Problem  
Device malfunction is defined as any occurrence in which the study device does not perform as intended, when 
used or attempted to be used in a study procedure .  As described in the device  Instructions for Use (IFU) , a visual 
examination of the VIG should be performed at the time of opening the packaging  and prior to use in a subject .   
Defective devices (obvious or suspected) should not be used.  A replacement  VIG should be obtained and the 
study procedure continued.  A device accountability log will be used to account for all used and opened/unused 
devices in this study.    
 
If a VIG defect or malfunction is discovered/su spected any time prior to vascular deployment, the VIG should not 
be used .  A replacement device/component should be used and the study procedure continued.  A Device 
Malfunction  form must be completed for all device malfunctions, failures or suspected failures, and the defective 
product identification should be recorded on the device accountability log .  Whenever possible, a 
defective/suspected defected VIG should be return ed to the Sponsor for evaluation.  
 
The Device Malfunction form (eCRF) should be used to report and provide details of situations in which the VIG 
does not perform as intended. Failure of the VIG to perform as intended may be potentially be due to a variety of 
reasons, including defect or suspected defect in the device itself or the delivery system; operator error; anatomic 
issues; or other reasons. If use of the VIG  is attempted but ultimately the device is not able to be used, a Device 
Malfunction eCRF should be submitted to report the surrounding details.   
 
NOTE: Device Malfunctions should  reported on the Device Malfunction eCRF within [ADDRESS_943930] with Sponsor ’s efforts to assess whether any SAEs associated 
with a device malfunction may also have occurred.   
 
 
 
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943931]  should be referred for surgical intervention.  No attempt should be made to 
remove an improperly deployed VIG  using percutaneous methods.  
 
Assessment of Graft Flow at the End of the Study Procedure  
An AV G placed using the VIG and a sutured arterial anastomosis  typi[INVESTIGATOR_333364] a pulse and/or thrill which is easily 
palpable over the skin or directly in the AVG prior to closure of the surgical incisions.  Thus, the AVG  flow 
assessment is similar that used for standard sutured AVGs. An optimal method to confirm AVG patency at the 
end of the implant procedure is to feel a thrill near the arterial anastomosis  or confirm a Doppler signal.   
Ascultation u sing a sterile or covered stethoscope is also acceptable.   At the physician’s discretion and as 
warranted, a final angiogram may  also be performed to verify patency of the graft . 
 
Initial Use of the Study Graft for Hemodialysis  
Initial hemodialysis cannulation of AVGs  placed with the VIG should be performed in accordance with the graft 
manufacturer’s Instructions for Use.   After needle withdrawal, use gentle, non -occlusive digital pressure to 
compress the cannulation site until hemostasis is achieved. The VIG should NOT be directly cannulated.   In 
accordance with standard practice, once placed, AVGs should be used for hemodialysis access as soon as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_110291]/or operator. For standard ePTFE AVGs, the time from placement to first 
cannulation is typi[INVESTIGATOR_695783].  Early cannulation AVGs can be used within one week after placement. 
Every effort should be made to minimize infection risk by [CONTACT_695799].

(http://esrdnetwork18.org/pdfs/QI%20 -%20FF%20Tools/FFTool_VAMPFlowChrt.pdf   or current).  
 
Pharmacologic Regimen  
There are n o study -specific pharmacologic requirements.  The need for intraoperative and postoperative 
anticoagulation therapy should be  based on subject  history  and m aintained a s deemed appropriate  by [CONTACT_24201] .  Anticoagulation /anti-platelet  therapy will be recorded on the  case report form  (CRF). 
 
Follow -up E valuation s 
Subject s will be followed  at two weeks and monthly thereafter  through six months  to assess AVG patency and  
complications.  Measurement of access flow rate is part of standard care. Data from routine AV access flow 
monitoring performed as part of usual care , as available,  will also be collected.    
 
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 17 of 32 
 Graft ultrasound evaluation should be performed at the 3 month and 6 month follow -up visits and the results 
recorded on the CRF.  
 
NOTE: For reference and in accordance with standard care, baseline flow measurements are typi[INVESTIGATOR_695784] 2 dialysis sessions 2  weeks apart; and monthly measurements will be performed thereafter.    An access 
flow rate < 500 mL/min or a drop in access flow rate of 25% from baseline should trigger an angiographic 
evaluation of the AVG  and possible intervention.  
 
Telephone follow -up for subjects that miss the final (6 month) follow -up visit  
If a study subject  misses or is unavailable/unwilling to return for the final [ADDRESS_943933]  or thei r dialysis center should be attempted  to determine the patency status of the AVG  
at 6 months  (the primary study endpoint), and to gather as much additional  information as possible in order to 
complete the [ADDRESS_943934]  cannot be reached, then the dialysis center 
should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]  (if allowed)  in order to determine AVG  patency at [ADDRESS_943935]  treatment and follow -up evaluation is shown in Table 1 .

Final Events  
The following final events will justify cessation of study follow -up: death, AVG  abandonment, lost to follow up  
(at least [ADDRESS_943936] should be made and documented) , or completion of study follow -up.   
 
12.0 POTENTIAL RISKS   
 
Potential adverse events that may occur and/or require treatment with use of the VIG include but are not limited 
to: 
• allergic reaction to device materials or procedure medications  
• anastomotic disruption or tearing  
• aneurysm  
• artery tear or rupture  
• bleeding  
• bruising  
• contrast dye reaction  
• death  
• device breakage  
• dissection or ‘tissue flap’ in blood ve ssels in which the VIG has been inserted  
• embolism  
• hematoma  
• infection  
• inflammation  
• kinking/compression of t he AV G and/or VIG device  
• migration or misplacement of VIG device  
• occlusion  
• pseudoaneurysm  in the AVG , VIG device , or adjacent native blood vessels  
• seroma  
• stenosis  of the AV G 
• swelling of implanted arm  
• thrombosis  of the AV G 
• vessel spasm  
 
Many of the potential adverse events listed above are similar to those that can occur during and after AVG  
placement using standard surgical techni ques. Potential risks of a standard surgical procedure to implant a n AVG  
for hemodialysis include but are not limited to the following:  
• failure of sutures  
• bleeding immediately after the procedure  
• infection  
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 19 of 32 
 • possible need for re -operation  
 
The VIG will be used together with a st andard 6mm AVG  for hemodialysis that is sold and packaged separately. 
Potential adverse events that may occur with use of the AVG  are described in the  Instructions for Use packaged 
with the AVG . 
Pregnant subjects are excluded from the study. In females of reproductive capacity , a pregnancy test must be 
performed prior to the procedure.  This is to ensure that a fetus is not irradiated.  Other potential risks to a fetus 
related to the study procedure are unknown.  
There are no unique blood tests required for the study; however, results of standard blood tests performed to 
evaluate general health status at baseline, during the study procedure and during study follow -up will be included 
with the study data.  Risks of having blood drawn include infection (rare) and bleeding (rare).  
Steps to Minimize Risk  
The following steps will be taken to minimize potential risks:  
• Rigorous technical training will be provided to physician investigators that will perform the study 
proce dures.  
• On-site monitoring w ill occur during the first procedure at each site . On- site monitors will include a 
clinical representative  of the sponsor. On-site monitors may also attend additional procedures throughout 
the co urse of the study.  
• The study procedure will be performed in a surgical suite with radiologic imaging capabilities. In the 
event that the study  procedure is unable to be performed (not expected), the patient will be able to receive 
traditional surgical graft implantation.           
 
13.0 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Potentia l clinical benefit(s) for the VIG  are unknown at this time.  Anastomoses with the VIG may potentially 
reduce venous vessel trauma, improve the local vessel wall shear stresses and promote laminar flow, thereby 
[CONTACT_695795].  
 
14.[ADDRESS_943937] .  
15.0 CRITERIA FOR STUDY TERMINATION  
 
The study  may be terminated at any time  for reasons of safety, based on a recommendation by [CONTACT_1201] , the study 
DSMB, or based on other considerations by [CONTACT_1034].  S erious, device -related or possibly related adverse 
events  that are unexpected in either frequency or type may prompt a review by  [CONTACT_458] , DSMB, 
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 20 of 32 
 Medical Monitor and /or Sponsor, and may lead to consider ation of  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. Such a review and 
discussion will be documented and included with the study records.  
 
16.0 STUDY DURATION  
 
Enrollment is expected to occur over a  24-month per iod.  The  6-month follow -up and 2 -month period of data 
analysis and regulatory submission preparation  is anticipated to be completed by Q 2 of 202 1. 
 
17.0 TRAINING  
 
The training of appropriate clinical site personnel will be the responsibility of Phraxis Clinical Department or 
their designees [ e.g. Data Coordinating Center (DCC)  staff] .  To assure uniform data collection and protocol 
compliance,  trainers  will present a form al educational session to  review the Investigational Plan, techniques for 
the identification of eligible subject s, instructions on data collection, follow -up schedules and regulatory 
requirements.  Ongoing detailed email and telephone feedback regarding completion of CRFs will be provided by 
[CONTACT_695800] . 
 
Prior to enrollment start, technical training on use of the study devices  will be provided by a Sponsor  
representative, who may also attend/observe the roll -in cases.  As part of the tec hnical training, physician 
operators will also perform ‘test deployments’ of the study devices  using a simulated -use model.   
 
Roll-in Cases  
Roll-in cases will be performed at each study site in order to confirm proper training and use of the study device  
and confirm comprehension of the study protocol.  “Roll -in” subjects will be identified as such before enrollment 
and treated according to the same protocol  and 6 month follow -up duration  as used in the main study.  Data from 
roll-in cases will be recorded using the same CRF as the main study.   The number of roll -in cases per each site 
investigator  will be determined by [CONTACT_1034], in collaboration with the primary  investigator  at each site .  No 
more than 1 -2 roll-in cases per investigator  are anticipated. The clinical experience and procedural data from roll -
in cases will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034] , in collaboration with each site investigator.  Upon successful 
completion of the roll -in case requirements, as determined by [CONTACT_1034] , sites will be permitted to begin 
enrollment in the main study. Clinical data from roll -in cases will not be included in the primary study analysis  
but will be analyzed and provided in a separate clinical report at the end of the study.   Data from roll -in cases will 
be included in the final safety analysis for the study.  
 
18.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
 
Analysis population  
The primary analysis population will include all subjects enrolled since June 5, 2018 and treated with the VIG + 
sutured arterial anastomosis, and also all VIG sub -study subjects enrolled after October 17, 2017.  Such subjects 
who meet the enrollment criteria and in whom use of the VIG is attempted will be included in the intention -to-
treat primary analysis population.    
 
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943938] 52 enrolled subjects that received an AIG+VIG (e.g., the interim analysis population) , 
the observed cumulative patency rate at [ADDRESS_943939] A VG implants ranged from 65% to 98% 
(Append ix B).    Based on the proposed sample size for the current study (see below) and an expected cu mulative 
patency rate of 8 4.6% for AVGs placed using the VIG , the exact, lower two -sided 95% confidence bound for 
cumulative patency is est imated to be 79.9% .  A comparison  to a target Performance Goal (PG) of 75% has been 
chosen for the evaluation.   
 
Hypotheses  
The primary study endpoint of the cumulative patency rate at 6 months will be eva luated  in the following testable 
hypotheses:  
H0:   (Cumulative Patency Rate) 6 Months   ≤  PG 
H1:   (Cumulative Patency Rate) 6 Months   >  PG  
where, PG = Performance Goal, here equal to 75%.  
There are no formal hypotheses associated with the evaluation of secondary endpoints.  
Data Analysis  
General Statistical Considerations  
a. Descriptive stati stics will be used to summarize subject baseline and outcome data collected during the study.  
Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges, 
minimums and maximums.  Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency distributions.  
b. Statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_305566] (e.g., SAS, SPSS, or Cytel Software)  
c. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_695785].  
d. A full data listing will be prepared, including an electronic version in a standard computer -accessible format 
(e.g., SAS) at the completion of the study.  Listings of data represented on the CRF will be provided for all 
key baseline, demographic and outcome variables to facilitate further investigation of tabulated values and to 
allow for clinical review of safety variables.  
A one -sided p -value of 0.[ADDRESS_943940] statistic will take the following form:  
 Z-test statistic =     (P - 0.75) / SE (P)

is estimated using the method of Peto et al ( 1977 ). [ADDRESS_943942] labeling.   
1. Acute device success will be summarized by [CONTACT_695801] 95% confidence interval.  
2. Primary Unassisted Patency at 6 Months will be summarized by [CONTACT_695802] 95% 
confidence interval.  
3. Time -to-First-Cannulation will be summarized by [CONTACT_695803] . 
4. Number and type of interventions required to maintain secondary patency will be summarized by [CONTACT_695804] . 
5. Number and type of serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_695805], the subject rates of SAEs by [CONTACT_24975], and the proportion of subjects with at least 
one SAE.  
Additional Safety Data  
In addition to summarizing and reporting SAEs (Secondary Endpoint 5), the number and type of non -serious 
adverse events (AEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_695806].  
Gender Analysis  
Cumulative patency rates between genders will be compared by [CONTACT_695807] a log rank test statistic to compare 
their respective Kaplan -Meier survival curves.   The heterogeneity of cumulative patency rates will also be 
examined using the test statistic used for the primary endpoint analysis.   Gender specific summary statistics will 
also be provided for study primary and secondary endpoints.  
 
Pooling of Sites  
Cumulative patency rates will be compared between study sites using a Chi -square test to evaluate the association 
between rates and sites.   A p -value of 0.[ADDRESS_943943] baseline factors to determine if site differences can b e explained by [CONTACT_695808].   
 
 
 
 
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943944] been considered in 
determining the sample size for the current study. The required sample size for the study was estimated using the 
following assumptions:  
• Test basis:   Kaplan -Meier estimate of cumulative patency rate at [ADDRESS_943945] binomial estimation 
for purposes of sample size  
• Type I error (alpha):   0.025 (one -sided)  
• Statistical power:  80%  
• Performance Goal (PG):  75%  
• Expected cumulative patency for InterGraft at 6 months:   8 4.6%. 
 
Based on the above assumptions, a total of 1 46 evaluable subjects w ill be req uired to compare observed 
cumulative patency  to a PG of 75%.   With an expected loss -to-follow -up rate of 8% over 6 months  (e.g., 12 
subjects) , a total of [ADDRESS_943946] -to-follow up .   Planned minimum and maximum

 19.0 DATA REPORTING AND  PROCESSING  
 
Data Collection  
Primary data collection  based on source documented medical records will be performed by [CONTACT_695809]. Electronic data capture  (EDC)  will be used .  The EDC system(s) used 
will be compliant with FDA requirements.   Site training  on EDC data recording will be provided by [CONTACT_245745] (DCC).   All EDC training will be documented in the Investigator site file. Throughout the 
study, a help desk at the DCC will be available for any questions that arise from the sites concerning EDC.  
 
Notification of subject enrollment must be provided to the Sponsor within 24 hours. The enrollment notification 
may be made by [CONTACT_695810] 24 hours of 
enrollment.  
 
The following guidance is provided regarding entry of CRF data into the EDC:  
• Pre-procedure (b aseline ) Imaging , Inclusion/Exclusion, Index Procedure, and Discharge information 
should be submitted within 2  days of enrollment.  
• Follow -up For ms should be submitted within [ADDRESS_943948] been resolved, the site principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_695786]/her signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a Verification CRF.  Once the study is completed, all data have been 
entered into the clinical database, and all discrepancies have been resolved, an audit will be conducted to verify 
that all requirements for database  lock have been met.  After data base lock, the DCC will export the data into SAS 
datasets and provide them to the project statistician.  
 
CRF submission status will be track ed by [CONTACT_695811].   
 
 
20.0 DATA MONITORIN G AND QUALITY ASSURANCE MEASURES  
 
Sponsor Monitoring  
Study site monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_695812] (e.g. contract monitors). On -
site monitoring will be performed to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with applicable regulations 
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943949].   
 
No sites may receive shipment of study devices until the following documents are received by [CONTACT_456]:  
• Written IRB approval for conduct of the study  
• IRB approval of a consent form  
• Signed Investigator Letter of Agreement  
• Executed Study Agreement  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_695787]’s CV and medical license  
• Financial Disclosure  
 
Clinical  sites will be regularly monitored for timeliness and accuracy of  data submitted to the DCC.  Any evident 
patterns of noncompliance with respect to the protocol, data accuracy, maintenance of source documentation, or 
timeliness will be cause for the site to be put on probation. If correction actions are not made, the site will be 
asked to withdraw from the study.  
 
Medical Monitor  
An independent  study medical monitor (MM) will be designated. The MM will be a qualified physician that is not 
a study investigator. The MM has the responsibility to review and evaluate information relevant to the study 
device safety throughout the development and implementation of the protocol. This oversight includes reviewing 
safety information and providing applicable recommendations to the sponsor. More specifically, the MM will:  
• Evaluate all SAEs and review safety reports. SAEs will be evaluated immediately upon report of 
occurrence.  
• Evaluate all UADEs at the time of occurrence.  
• Advise the Sponsor (IDE holder)  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  (UADE)  
Federal law requires that the FDA be notified immediately of all Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE).   
Investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an UADE as “any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR 812.3(s).”  
 
The UADE review and notification process will be as follows:  
 
(i) The study site will submit an Adverse Event (AE) report, indicating that the AE is serious  and 
related or possibly related  to the study device.  Study sites must  report all SAEs (including 
UADEs) to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery.  If additional supporting information 
regarding the SAE is requested after the initial 24 -hour report, the information will be promptly 
sent to the Sponsor, when available, via email.  
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 26 of 32 
 (ii) The Sponsor will immediately conduct an evaluation and prepare a UADE report.  The Sponsor 
will consult with the Medical Monitor (MM) as part of the UADE evaluation process, and the 
MM will review the UADE report and applicable information for clarity and completeness. The 
sponsor and MM may contact [CONTACT_779], as needed, for additional information and clarification.  
(iii) The Sponsor will report the results of the UADE evaluation to FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and 
participating investigators within [ADDRESS_943950] receives notice of the 
UADE (§§ 812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1).  
NOTE:   Not all SAEs may bear a relation to the study device or procedure, and it is partly the responsibility of the 
MM to confirm that any claims of connectivity are reasonable and that all serious events are properly reported, 
regardless of causation.  
In summary, the MM will collaborate wi th the Sponsor on safety oversight  to meet human subjects’ safety 
standards as defined by [CONTACT_695813], International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (GCP).  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent DSMB  is established and h as responsibility  for safeguarding the interests of study 
participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of study procedures, and for monitoring the overall 
conduct of the study.  The DSMB is an independent group advisory to the Sponsor, and is required to 
provide recommendations about starting, continuing, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. In addition, the DSMB is 
asked to make recommendations, as appropriate, to the Sponsor about:  
• Efficacy of the study intervention  
• Benefit/risk ratio of procedures and participant burden  
• Selection, recruitment, and retention of participants  
• Adherence to protocol requirements  
• Completeness, quality, and analysis of measurements  
• Amendments to the study protocol and consent forms  
• Performance of individual centers and core labs  
• Participant safety, and

Details of DSMB operations  are defined in the DSMB Charter document.  
21.0 CLINICAL EVENTS   
Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom or medical or psychological condition  
even if the event is not considered to be related or possibly related to the study device or study  
procedure/intervention.  Medical condition/diseases present before starting the study will be considered  
adverse events only if they worsen after starting study treatment. An adverse event is also any undesirable and 
unintended effect of research occurring in human subjects as a result of the collection of identifiable private 
Investigational Plan / Rev 8  CONFIDENTIAL  Phraxis, Inc.  
  Page 27 of 32 
 information under the research. Adverse events also include any problems associated with the use of a study 
device that adversely affects the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition which  
is fatal, is life -threatening, requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is medically significant and which the 
investigator regards as serious based on appropriate medical judgment. An important medical event is any AE that 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definitions of SAEs.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Event (UAE)  is defined as any event or experience that meets all three criteria  below:  
• Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity or frequency, given the research procedures that are described 
in the protocol -related documents AND in the characteristics of the subject population being studied  
• Related or possibly related to participation in research. This means that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the incident may have been caused by [CONTACT_695814].  
• The incident suggests that the research placed the patient or others at greater risk of harm than was 
previously known or recognized OR results in actual harm to the patient or others  
 
The occurrence of AEs, including S AEs and UAEs, will be monitored throughout the study duration.  Adverse 
event information will be collected and reported on designated AE forms, assessed and classified by [CONTACT_1961] [INVESTIGATOR_695788]/not serious. The investigator will also determine the relatedness of the AE to the study 
device and study procedure according to the following definitions:  
 
o Related (AE is clearly related to the device/procedure);  
o Possibly related (AE may be related to the device/procedure);  
o Unrelated (AE is clearly not related to the device/procedure).  
 
Procedure -related AEs are AEs that occur during the time interval from when the subject  enters and leaves the 
surgical treatment suite for the index procedure (e.g., AV G implant procedure).  Thus, the procedure includes use 
of the study device, as well as any treatments or procedures that are applied before or after the study device (eg, 
anesthesia, suturing of incision sites after AVG is completed), while the subject  is in the surgical suite.  
Device -related AEs are AEs related or possibly related to the study device  or to the study device procedure which 
includes delivery, deployment, and attachment of the study device  to the AV G.  
Device -related events that occur during the study procedure are also procedure -related events.  
 
Procedure -related events may not necessarily be related to the study device; for example, a procedure event such 
as an anesthesia reaction would not be related to the study device.    
 
Device -related events may also occur after the study procedure, for example, fracture of metal strut in the VIG. 
 
For situations in which a study subject  has a serious adverse event (SAE) that results in abandonment of the study 
AV access site, the subject  should be followed to the next follow -up visit after the study AVG  is abandoned. This 
is done in order to collect general information about the subject ’s health status after the AVG  is abandoned.   
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943951]  be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
discovery , and to national and local regulatory authorities, in accordance with national and local policies and 
procedures.  In addition, all unanticipated adverse device effects  (UADE)  will be evaluated at the time of 
discovery  and reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours.   SAEs are reported by [CONTACT_695815], using a 
designated SAE reporting form provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
 
A final determination as to whether an SAE meets the requirements for expedited reporting to the FDA and 
participating IRBs will be made by [CONTACT_695816]/or Sponsor.  
 
Reporting Deaths.  
Data regarding a subject  death should be recorded on the AE/SAE eCRF as follows:  
If the outcome of an AE is reported as FATAL, then the STOP DATE of the AE should be date of the death.  The 
AE with the fatal outcome will generally be the ‘cause of death’ as stated in source documents. The AE causing 
the death should be recorded on the eCRF either by [CONTACT_695817] 
"Other" and then specifying the AE causing the death.  
 
If a death is discovered during follow -up and there is no information available regarding the AE(s) leading to the 
death outcome, please complete the AE/SAE eCRF, and mark as “other” for AE type.  Record ‘fatal’ for the 
outcome. The START DATE and STOP DATE recorded should be the same date, eg the date of death.  In the 
“Event Summary” section, provide the date of death.  Complete as much information as possible on this eCRF.   
 
For all deaths, a copy of source document information (e.g., death record, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695789], etc) should be provided, if available.  Deaths should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
discovery, along with any available source documents describing the death, as available. Additional Source 
document information regarding the death, as may be requested by [CONTACT_695818] , should be provided as soon as it becomes available.  
 
Clinical Events Committee  
A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will provide medical review of SAEs, UAEs, and any deaths that may occur 
throughout the study.  The CEC will be comprised of the Medical Monitor,  and the Sponsor’s Chief Science  
Officer,  Chief Technology Officer and  Director of Clinical Affairs.  Details of CEC operations  are defined in a 
CEC Charter document.  
 
The principal investigator/institution will permit study -related monitoring, audits of IRB/Ethics committee 
reviews, and regulatory inspections by [CONTACT_60282]. On -site data 
monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_2728]’s study monito rs.  Any data discrepancies will be resolved and 
documented by  a standardized data query process.  
 
 
 
 
Investigational Plan / Rev [ADDRESS_943952] operating procedures, Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), national or local regulations. 
Protocol violations may or may not be under the control of the research team or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717].  
 
Major Protocol Violations  
All major protocol violations must be reported to the IRB, as applicable and in accordance with local IRB policy, 
AND to the study sponsor, immediately upon discovering them, and no later than seven (7) calendar days from 
the time the study team receives knowledge of the event . 
 
A major violation is a protocol violation that meets the following criteria:  
• Represent a serious or continuing failure on the part of the study team to comply with the protocol, 
standard operating procedures, GCPs, federal, state or local regulations;  
• Impacts subject  safety or substantially alter risks to subject s. May or may not result in actual harm 
(clinical, emotional, social, financial, etc);  
• Significantly damages the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the data collected for the study;  
• Is under control of the investigator/research team/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717] . 
 
Any evident patterns of noncompliance with the protocol requirements  will be cause for the site to be put on 
probation for a period of 1 month. If corrective  actions are not made, the site will be asked to withdraw from the 
study.  
 
A log of all protocol deviations should be maintained in the study regulatory binder.

1. INTRODUCTION AND BAC KGROUND  
Curing is the process used i n manufacturing of contact [CONTACT_724323] 
a lens shape.  Curing is achieved at JJVC by [CONTACT_724324] a light 
tunnel within the manufacturing line.  Historically, the lights have varied in intensity 
throughout the tunnel.  It is unknown what  happens if the manufacturing line stalls and the 
lens is exp osed to a static curing process.   A static curing process is also a more robust process 
and is therefore desirable provided similar clinical performance to a var iable intensity process.  
 
The present study is designed to demonstrate non -inferiority of the Test lens (static -curing 
process) compared to the Control lens (step -curing process) with respect to  comfort 
and quality of vision.  
1.1. Name [CONTACT_724343] -based contact [CONTACT_724325] a new UV -blocker.  
Both lenses are investigational.   
 they will  serve as the Control lens while the lenses 
manufactured with static -curing will serve as the Test lens.  
1.2. Intended Use of Investigational Products  
The intended use of the investigative product in this study is for correcting myopia and 
providing visual bene fits in bright lighting situations. During the study, each test article will 
be worn bilaterally in a daily wear modality for at least [ADDRESS_988997] version of the  Investigator’s Brochure.

4. STUDY DESIGN AND RAT IONALE  
4.1. Description of Study Design  
This study is a randomized, [ADDRESS_989006] 80 subjec ts to 
complete.  
 
The study begins with an initial visit (Visit 1). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility 
criteria, they will be random to one of two lens wear sequences (Test/Control/Control or 
Control/Test/Test).  
 
CR-[ADDRESS_989007] five (5) days per week for at least six (6) hours per day for a period of two weeks each. 
Lens replacement is scheduled at [ADDRESS_989008] lenses approximately two weeks each on a daily wear (DW) basis, then wear 
either the Test or Control lens again for two weeks, for a total study  duration of approximately 
42 days (6 weeks) per subject.  
5. TEST ARTICLE ALLOCAT ION AND MASKING  
5.1. Test Article Allocation  
Use of the test articles will be randomized using a randomization scheme supplied by [CONTACT_653827].  
 
This is a multi -site, double -masked, dispensing and randomized study.  The study lenses will 
be worn in a bilateral and random fashion using a 2 treatment by 3 period (2x3) crossover 
design.  
 
A block size of two (2) sequences will be utilized. A computer -generated randomization 
scheme will be used to randomly assign subjects, in blocks of 2, to one of the two possible 
lens wear sequences (TEST/CONTROL/CONTROL or CONTROL/TEST/TEST). The 
random scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_724333] f rom SAS 
Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
 
The study site must follow the randomization scheme provided and complete enrollment 
according to the randomization list and not pre -select or assign subjects. The randomized 
CR-[ADDRESS_989009] occurred prior to randomization:  
 
• Informed consent has been obtained  
• Subject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria  
• Subject history and baseline inform ation has been collected . 
5.2. Masking  
Both test lenses will contain the same new UV -blocker.  Therefore, double -masking is 
possible and will be used to keep both the subject and investigators masked to the identity of 
the study lenses throughout the duration o f the study period. Every attempt will be made to 
keep the other clinical trial personnel involved in the study (e.g. Data management and 
Biostatistician) unaware of the identity of the study lenses.  
 
The identity of the study lenses will be masked by [CONTACT_724334] a label 
containing the study number, lot number, sphere power, expi[INVESTIGATOR_724315] P or W. Only the personnel involved in the over labeling and the unmasked statistician 
will have access to the lens decode information translating the randomization codes into test 
and control groups. The medical monitor will also have access to the decode information in 
case breaking the mask is necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a subject.  
 
Masking will be  used to reduce potential bias. Subjects will be unaware of the identity of the 
investigational product.  Investigators and clinical site personnel involved in the data 
collection will be masked as to the identity of the investigational product.  
 
Under normal circumstances, the mask should not be broken until all subjects have completed 
the study and the datab ase is finalized. Otherwise, the mask should be broken only if specific 
emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by [CONTACT_724335]. In such cases, the Investigator may, in an emergency, contact [CONTACT_7195].  
In the event the mask is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, 
time, and reason for the unmasking must be document ed in the subject record. The 
Investigator is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to the clinical site or 
Sponsor personnel.  
 
Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unmasked are expected to return for all 
remaining schedule d evaluations.  Subjects who are discontinued will be replaced.  
5.3. Procedures for Maintaining and Breaking the Masking  
The test articles mask shall not be broken unless information concerning the lens type is 
necessary for the urgent medical treatment of a su bject.  The Sponsor must be notified before 
the mask is broken.  
 
When dispensing test articles, the following steps should be followed to maintain 
randomization codes:  
CR-[ADDRESS_989010], placed in labeled glass vials with 
Opti-Free® Puremoist®, and stored refrigerated or frozen until they are shipped back to the 
Sponsor.  The lenses will be shipped in special containers to keep the lenses refrigerated.  
 
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return b ack to JJVC.  
All worn study lenses will be collected from the subject, placed in labeled glass vials with 
Opti-Free® Puremoist®, and stored refrigerated or frozen until they are shipped back to the 
Sponsor.  The lenses will be shipped in special containers  to keep the lenses refrigerated.  
 
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for poten tial return back to JJVC.  
6.6. Collection and Storage of Samples  
All worn lenses will be collected and stored in a labeled vial.  The lenses will be stored cold 
at the investigational site and shipped back to JJVC cold for lab testing.  
 
When possible, any lens or test article associated with an Adverse Events and/or a Product 
Quality Complaint must be retained and stored in a glass vial with moderate solution pending 
directions from the sponsor for potential return back to JJVC.  
6.7. Accountability of Test Articles  
JJVC will provide the Investigator with sufficient quantities of study articles and supplies to 
complete the investigation.  The Investigator is asked to retain all lens shipment 
documentation for the test article accountability records.  
 
Test article must  be kept in a locked storage cabinet, accessible only to those assigned by [CONTACT_35500]. The Investigator may delegate this activity to authorized study 
site personnel listed on the Site Delegation Log.  All test articles must be account ed.  This 
includes: 
 
1. What was dispensed for the subject for trial fitting, to wear out of the office, or issued 
for the subject to replace appropriately between visits  
2. What was returned to the Investigator unused  
3. The number and reason for unplanned replac ements   
 
The Investigator will collect all unused test articles from the subjects at the end of the subject’s 
participation. Subject returned unused test articles must be separated from the clinical study 
inventory of un -dispensed test articles, and must be labeled with the subject number and date 
of return.  Following final reconciliation of test articles by [CONTACT_2037], the Investigator or 
monitor will return all unused test articles to JJVC.

8. SUBJECTS COMPLETION/ WITHDRAWAL  
8.1. Com pletion Criteria  
Subjects are considered to have completed the study if they:  
• provided informed consent  
• completed all scheduled visits  
8.2. Withdrawal/Discontinuation from the Study  
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Subject death during the study period  
• Subject withdrawal of consent  
• Subject not compliant to protocol (e.g. Subject more than 2 days out of visit window).  
• Subject lost to follow -up  
• Subject no longer meets eligibility criteria (e.g. the subject becomes preg nant) 
• Subject develops significant or serious adverse events causing discontinuation of 
study lens wear (subjects missing more than 2 days of missed lens wear within a period 
1 of week should be discontinued)  
• Subjects who have experienced a Corneal Infilt rative Event (CIE)  
• Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the subject safety reasons (that it is in the 
best interest of the subject to stop treatment)  
• Subject missed any scheduled study visits  
• Subject not compliant with study lens wear schedule  
• Subject not successfully dispensed due to lack of efficacy and safety including poor 
vision, poor comfort or unacceptable fit  
 
For discontinued subjects, the Investigator will:  
• Complete the current visit (scheduled or unscheduled)  
• Complete the Final Evaluation, indicating the reason that the subject was discontinued 
from the study  
• Record the spherocylindrical refraction with best corrected distance visual acuity  
• Collect used test article(s) (worn or brought to the visit) from the subject and discard 
them, unless otherwise stated in Section 7.2 
• Collect all unused test article(s) from the subject  
 
An additional subject will be enrolled if a subjec t discontinues from the study prematurely.  
 
In cases where a subject is lost to follow -up, every possible effort must be made to contact 
[CONTACT_23814]/withdrawal.  The measures taken to 
CR-[ADDRESS_989013] be document ed including two written attempts and a certified letter (or 
equivalent) as the final attempt.  
9. PRE -STUDY AND CONCOM ITANT INTERVENTION/M EDICATION  
Concomitant medications will be documented during screening and updated during the study.  
Disallowed medicati ons for this study include:   see Section 3.3.    
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35443]:   see Section 3.3.  
10. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL  
Investigator will notify study sponsor upon identification of a protocol deviation. Major 
protocol deviations must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after discovery of the 
protocol deviation.  The Investigator will report deviations per IRB/IEC requirements.  All 
deviations will be tracked and corrective actions implemented as appropriate.  
 
If it becomes  necessary for the Investigator to implement a deviation in order to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the trial subject, the Investigator may implement the deviation 
immediately without notification to the sponsor. Within [ADDRESS_989014] notify and provide the rationale to the Sponsor and, as 
required, the IEC/IRB.  
11. STUDY TERMINATION  
The occurrence of one or more Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE), or 
any SAE where the relationship to study ag ent cannot be ruled out, may result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35446].  In the event of a [LOCATION_003]DE or SAE, the Sponsor may unmask 
the treatment regimen for the subject(s) and will discuss this with the Investigator before any 
further subjects are  enrolled. 
 
The Sponsor will determine when a study will be stopped.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_93788]’s results are compromised.  
 
JJVC reserve s the right to terminate the study at any time for any reason.  Additionally, the 
IEC/IRB reserves the right to terminate the study if an unreasonable risk is determined.  The 
study can be terminated by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_724316], if in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], after a discussion with JJVC, it is determined 
that it would be unwise to continue at the clinical site.    
 
JJVC (and the IEC/IRB and  DMC, if applicable) will evaluate all adverse events.  If it is 
determined that an adverse event presents an unreasonable risk, the investigation, or that part 
of the investigation presenting the risk, will be terminated, as soon as possible.  
 
Should the study be terminated (either prematurely or as scheduled), the Investigator will 
notify the IEC/IRB and Regulatory Authority as required by [CONTACT_35512].  
CR-[ADDRESS_989015] Quality Complaint (PQC) refers to any written, electronic, or oral commu nication 
that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
effectiveness or performance of test articles after they have been released for clinical trial use.   
 
Potential complaints may come from a variety of sou rces including but not limited to subjects, 
clinical research associates (CRA), clinical operations managers (COM), medical monitors, 
and site personnel, etc. The following are not considered product quality complaints:  
• Subject satisfaction inquiries repor ted via “Subjective Questionnaires” and “Patient 
Reported Outcomes (PRO)”  
• Clinical test articles that are stored improperly or damaged after receipt at the 
investigational site  
• Lens replacements that occur due to drops/fall -outs 
• Damage deemed by [CONTACT_724336], 
and not indicative of a quality deficiency (i.e. tears, rips, etc.), only in situations where 
there is no deficiency alleged by [CONTACT_656486] [ADDRESS_989016] be 
recorded in the EDC system, which will trigger an automatic email notification to the 
appropriate COM/CRA and Clinical QA representative. In cases where the EDC system in 
use is not configured to send automatic notifications  or when an EDC system is not used, the 
COM/CRA is responsible for notifying Clinical QA upon discovery that a PQC has occurred.   
 
Upon receipt of the EDC notification, the COM/CRA will contact [CONTACT_724337] i nclude:  
• Date the complaint was received/recorded in the EDC System (Date of Sponsor 
Awareness)  
• Who received the complaint  
• Study number  
• Clinical site information (contact [CONTACT_2300], site ID, telephone number)  
• Lot number(s)  
• Unique Subject Identifier(s)  
• Indication of who first observed complaint (site personnel or subject)  
• OD/OS indication, along with whether the lens was inserted  
• Any related AE number if applicable  
• Detailed complaint description (scheduled/unscheduled visit, wear time, symptoms, 
resolution of symptoms, etc.)  
• Eye Care Provider objective (slit lamp) findings if applicable  
• Confirmation of product availability for return (and tracking information, if available), 
or rationale if product is not available for return 
 
 
Once a complaint is received, it will be assessed by [CONTACT_19569], CRA, or trained site personnel 
to determine if it is an Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event (AE/SAE).  If the complaint 
results in an AE/SAE, the COM/CRA,  or trained site personnel will follow Section 13 of this 
CR-6140 v2.0

CONFIDENTIAL

protocol. If the AE/SAE was potentially the result of a product quality related deficienc y, 
these procedures also applies and will be executed in parallel.   
 
In some cases, a PQC form may be generated in EDC by [CONTACT_35514].  In this event, the 
PQC forms will be marked “Intentionally Left Blank” or “ILB”.  Justification for ILB must 
be documented.  
13. ADVERSE EVENTS  
13.1. Definitions and Classifications  
Adverse Event (AE) – An AE is “any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or 
injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users 
or other persons,  whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device 
or the comparator.  
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes events related to the procedures inv olved. 
Note 3 to entry: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices .”0 
 
An AE includes any condition (including a pre -existing condition) that:  
1. Was not present prior to the study, but appeared or reappeared following initiation of 
the study  
2. Was present prior to the study, but worsened during the study. This would include any 
condition resulting  from concomitant illnesses, reactions to concomitant medications, 
or progression of disease states  
3. Pregnancy must be documented as an adverse event and must be reported to the 
clinical monitor and to the Sponsor immediately upon learning of the event  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (e.g., a sight threatening event, 
a significant persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage, or disruption to the 
subject’s body)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• Requires intervention to prevent permanent damage (the use of the test article  resulting 
in a condition which requires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent 
impairment of the body structure or a body function).  Important medical events that 
may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204216] y be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition

Significant Adverse Events  – Those events that are usually symptomatic and warrant 
discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of the test article (excluding Serious Adverse 
Events).   
 
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Significant Adverse Events include, but 
not limited to the foll owing:

• Any corneal event which necessitates temporary lens discontinuation >2 weeks  
 
Non-Significant Adverse Events  – Those conditions that are usually asymptomatic a nd 
usually do not warrant discontinuation (temporary or permanent) of the test article.  However, 
the Investigator may choose to treat as a precautionary measure.   
 
Diagnoses and conditions that are considered Ocular Non -Significant Adverse Events include , 
but not limited to the following:

• Any corneal event not explicitly defined as serious or significant adverse event, which 
necessitates temporary lens discontinuation <[ADDRESS_989017] (ADE) – An ADE is an “adverse event related to the use of an 
investigat ional medical device.  
Note 1 to entry: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.  
Note 2 to entry: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.”[ADDRESS_989018] (UADE) – Any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, the test article, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or  degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, Investigator’s Brochure or protocol, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with the test article that relates to the rights, safety 
and welfare of subjects.  
13.2. Assessing Adverse Events  
In conjunction with the medical monitor, the Investigator will evaluate adverse events to 
ensure the events are categorized correctly.  Elements of categorization will include:  
• Seriousness/Classifications (see definition in Section 13.1) 
• Causality or Relatedness – i.e. the relationship between the test article, study treatment 
or study procedures and the adverse event (not related; unlikely related; pos sibly 
related; related - see definition in Section 13.2.1) 
• Adverse Event Severity – Adverse event severity is used to assess the degree of 
intensity of the adverse event (mild; moderate; severe for all events - see definition in 
Section 0)   
• Outcome – not recovered or not resolved; recovering or resolving; recovered or 
resolved with sequelae; recovered or resolved; death related to adverse  event; 
unknown 
• Actions Taken – none; temporarily discontinued; permanently discontinued; other  
13.2.1. Causality Assessment  
Causality Assessment – A determination of the relationship between an adverse event and 
the test article. The test article relationship for  each adverse event should be determined by 
[CONTACT_32981]:  
• Not Related - An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article, study 
treatment or study procedures  
• Unlikely Related – An adverse event for which an al ternative explanation is more 
likely, e.g. concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), or the relationship of time 
suggests that a causal relationship is not likely  
• Possibly Related – An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article, or  
to the study treatment or study procedures. An alternative explanation, e.g. 
CR-6140 v2.0
 
Page 49 of 131
CONFIDENTIAL

concomitant treatment, concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive.  The relationship in 
time is reasonable.  Therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded  
• Related – An adver se event that is listed as a possible adverse effect (device) or 
adverse reaction (drug) and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_376706], e.g. concomitant treatment of concomitant disease(s).  The relationship 
in time is very suggestive, e .g. it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challenge and re -challenge  
13.2.2. Severity Assessment  
Severity Assessment – A qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an adverse event 
as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of test article, study treatment or study procedure relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild – Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and d oes not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate – Event is bothersome, possible requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities  
• Severe – Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy 
and interferes with the subject’s daily activities  
13.3. Documentation and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
The recording and documenting of adverse events (ocular and non -ocular) begins when the 
subjects are exposed to the test article, study treatment or  study procedure.  Adverse events 
reported before the use of test article, start of study treatment, or study procedures will be 
recorded as medical history. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study it will be recorded and report ed as an AE. Untoward medical events reported after the 
subject’s exit from the study will be recorded as adverse events at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
 
Upon finding an adverse event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19535]. He/she will complete the Adverse Event /eCRF.   
 
Complete descriptions of all adverse events must be available in the subject record. All 
Adverse Events including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “ser ious 
adverse events” shall be captured on the appropriate case report form or electronic data 
system. All adverse events occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship.   
 
It is the Investig ator’s responsibility to maintain documentation of each reported adverse 
event. All adverse events will be followed in accordance with applicable licensing 
requirements.  Such documentation will include the following:  
• Adverse event (diagnosis not symptom)  
• Drawings or photographs (where appropriate) that detail the finding (e.g., size, 
location, and depth, etc.)  
• Date the clinical site was notified  
• Date and time of onset  
CR-6140 v2.0
 
Page 50 of 131
CONFIDENTIAL

• Date and time of resolution  
• Adverse event classification, severity, and relationship to  test articles, as applicable  
• Treatment regimen instituted, including concomitant medications prescribed, in 
accordance with applicable licensing requirements  
• Any referral to another health care provider if needed  
• Outcome, ocular damage (if any)  
• Likely eti ology 
• Best corrected visual acuity at the discovery of the event and upon conclusion of the 
event 
 
In addition, if an infiltrate(s) is present, he/she will complete the Corneal Infiltrate Assessment 
eCRF.  Where necessary, a culture of the corneal lesion w ill be collected to determine if the 
infection is microbial in nature.  If cultures are collected, the date of culture collection and 
laboratory utilized will be recorded.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE shall be documented to allow an assessment of the  duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed.  Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Changes in the 
assessment of relationship to the Test Article shall also be cl early documented.  
 
Subjects who present with an adverse event shall be followed by [CONTACT_737], within 
licensure, until all signs and symptoms have returned to pre -treatment status, stabilized, or 
been satisfactorily resolved.  If further treatment be yond licensure is required, the patient will 
be referred to the appropriate health care provider.  The Investigator will use his/her clinical 
judgment as to whether a subject reporting with an adverse event will continue in the study.  
If a subject is disc ontinued from the study, it will be the responsibility of the Investigator to 
record the reason for discontinuation.  The Investigator will also document the adverse event 
appropriately and complete the Adverse Event eCRF. Any subjects with ongoing adverse  
events related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures, as of the final study visit 
date, should be followed to resolution of the adverse event or until referral to an appropriate 
health care provider, as recommended by [CONTACT_737]. Non-ocular adverse events that are 
not related to the test article, study treatment, or study procedures may be recorded as 
“ongoing” without further follow -up. 
13.4. Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator will notify the Sponsor of an adverse event by e -mail, facsimile, or telephone 
as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours from discovery for any serious /significant 
adverse events, and 2 days from discovery for any non -significant adverse event.  In addition, 
a written report will be submitted by [CONTACT_941] P rincipal Investigator to the IEC/IRB according to 
their requirements (Section 13.4.2).  The report will comment whether the adverse event was 
considered to be related to the test article, study treatment or study procedures.

13.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events to Sponsor  
Serious/Significant Adverse Events  
The Investigator will inform the sponsor of all serious/significant adverse events occurring 
during the st udy period as soon as possible by e -mail, fax, or telephone, but no later than 24 
hours following discovery of the event.  The Investigator is obligated to pursue and obtain 
information requested by [CONTACT_724338] t he eCRF. 
All subjects experiencing a serious/significant adverse event must be followed up and all 
outcomes must be reported.  
 
When medically necessary, the Investigator may break the randomization code to determine 
the identity of the treatment that the s ubject received.  The Sponsor and study monitor should 
be notified prior to unmasking the test articles.  
 
In the event of a serious/significant adverse event, the Investigator must:  
• Notify the Sponsor immediately  
• Obtain and maintain in the subject’s records all pertinent medical information and 
medical judgment for colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject 
• Provide the Sponsor with a complete case history which includes a statement as to 
whether the event was or was not rela ted to the use of the test article  
• Notify the IEC/IRB as required by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB reporting procedure according to 
national regulations  
 
Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
In the event of an Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect (U ADE), the Investigator 
will submit a report of the UADE to the Sponsor and IEC/IRB as soon as possible, but no 
later than [ADDRESS_989019] report the results of the 
evaluation to FDA, the IEC/IRB and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_989020].  
 
Non-Serious Adverse Events  
All non-serious adverse events, including non -serious adverse device effects, will be reported 
to the sponsor by [CONTACT_35521] 2 days from discovery.  
13.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events to the Responsible IEC/IRB and Health Authorities  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19582].  
 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
CR-[ADDRESS_989021]  
Adverse events that meet the IEC/IRB requirements for reporting must be reported within the 
IEC/IRB’s written guidelines. Each clinical site will refer to and follow any guidelines set 
forth by [CONTACT_19581]/IRB. Each clinical site will refer to and follow a ny guidelines 
set forth by [CONTACT_19582].  
 
The Sponsor will report applicable Adverse Events to the local health authorities according 
the written guidelines, including reporting timelines.  
13.5. Reporting of Pregnancy  
Subjects report ing pregnancy (by [CONTACT_6270] -report) during the study will be discontinued after the 
event is recorded as an Adverse Event.  Once discontinued, pregnant participants and their 
fetuses will not be monitored for study related purposes.  At the Investigator’s discr etion, the 
study participant may be followed by [CONTACT_71178]. However, this data 
will not be collected as part of the clinical study database.  Pregnant participants are not 
discontinued from contact [CONTACT_724339] r safety concerns, but due to 
general concerns relating to pregnancy and contact [CONTACT_19584].  Specifically, pregnant women 
are discontinued due to fluctuations in refractive error and/or visual acuity that occur 
secondary to systemic hormonal changes, and no t due to unforeseen health risks to the mother

14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
14.1. General Considerations  
Statistical Analysis will be undertaken by [CONTACT_35522]. 
A general description of the statistical methods to be implemented in this clinical trial is 
outlined below.   
 
All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version 
9.4, add/modify software if necessary (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) . Throughout the analysis of 
data, the resul ts for each subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  Unscheduled visits will summarized separately and will be excluded from 
the statistical analysis.  
Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency table s) will be provided for all 
baseline variables, efficacy variables and safety variables as appropriate.  Continuous 
variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum and maximum). Frequency count an d percentage of subjects or eyes within 
each category will be provided for categorical data.  
14.2. Sample Size Justification  
This study was designed and powered to show non -inferiority between the Test lens compared 
to the Control lens with respect to CLUE comfo rt and vision. It was assumed there was no 
difference between the Test and Control lenses. The sample size was calculated to achieve a 
minimum statistical power of 90% and a type I error of 5%.  
CR-[ADDRESS_989022] lens from CR -5960 is the Control for this study.  CR-5960 enrolled 133 subjects, of 
which 130 (97.7%) were dispensed study lenses. Of the dispensed subjects, 127 (95.5%) 
completed the study and 3 (2.3%) subjects were dis continued. The per -protocol population 
included 121 (91.0%) subjects out of the total 127 that completed. Table 4 summarizes CLUE 
scores from CR-5960 at the 2 -week follow -up.13

1SD: Standard Deviation  
 
Sample size calculation for CLUE comfort and vision were carried out using an 
approximation of the power of an F -test derived from the non-centrality parameter calculated 
form the observed F -statistic of a linear model . 14 
 
Model details:  
CLUE comfort and vision were analyzed separately  using a linear mixed model. Lens type, 
was included as  the only fixed effect .  A compound symmetric (CS) covariance was used to 
model the correlation between measurements within the  same subject across study periods.  
Below is the variance -covariance matrix used in the CLUE each model.

CR-[ADDRESS_989023] lens and Control lens, the sample size required to 
achieve non -inferiority with a minimum power of 90% and a type I error controlled at 5% 
was estimated to be 80 subjects.  
14.3. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population:  
All subjects who were administered any test article excluding subjects who drop out prior to 
administering any test article. At least one observation should be recorded.  
 
Per-Protocol Population:  
All subjects who have successfully completed all visits and di d not substantially deviate from 
the protocol as determined by [CONTACT_35524] 
(Per-Protocol Population). Justification of excluding subjects with protocol deviations in the 
per-protocol population set will be documented in a memo to file.  
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:  
All randomized subjects regardless of actual treatment and subsequent withdrawal from study 
or deviation from protocol. At least one observation should be recorded.  
14.4. Level of Statistical Signi ficance  
All planned analysis for this study will be conducted with an overall type I error rate of 5%.  
14.5. Primary Analysis  
CLUE Comfort and Vision  
 
Overall comfort and vision CLUE scores will be analyzed separately using a linear mixed 
model adjusting for b aseline values as a covariate. Sequence of lens wear, period, lens type, 
first order carryover effect will be included in each model as fixed effects. An appropriate 
covariance structure will be used to model the residual errors between measurements within  
same subject across study periods (R -side). The covariance structure will be selected based 
on the finite -sample corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion. Covariance structures 
considered include:  
 
• Unstructured Covariance Structure (UN)  
• Homogenous Compound symmetry (CS)  
• Heterogeneous Compound Symmetry (CSH)  
• Autoregressive first order (AR  (1)) 
 
For autoregressive first order (AR  (1)), Site and Subject nest within site will be included as 
random effects (G -side). For the remaining covariance structure s only site will be included as 
a random effect (G -side). The Kenward and Roger method (Kenward and Roger, 1997) will 
be used for the denominator degree of freedom.  
 
Comparisons between the test and control lens at the 2 -weeks follow -up will be carried ou t 
using two-sided 95% confidence intervals constructed for least -square mean differences (test 
CR-6140 v2.0

minus control). The lower limit of the 95% confidence interval will be compared to -[ADDRESS_989024] lens relative 
to the control will be concluded if a lower limit is above -5.  If non-inferiority is established 
the superiority will be tested. S uperiority will be declared if the lower limit of the 95% 
confidence interval is above 0.  
14.6. Secondary Analysis  
Not Applicable.  
14.7. Other Exploratory Analyses  
Driving, Indoor and Outdoor Performance  
 
Each driving, indoor and outdoor performance item will be analyzed separately using a 
generalized linear mixed model for ordinal data with a multinomial distribution and 
cumulative logit as a link function. The experimental design factors: sequence of lens  wear, 
period, lens type, first order carryover effect will be included in each model as fixed effects.  
Site will be included as a random effect. An appropriate covariance structure will be used to 
model the residual errors between measurements within sam e subject across study periods.  
 
The assumption of proportionality of odds across response categories will be assessed 
graphically. If this assumption is violated then the distribution of responses will be 
investigated.  If sparse data is observed then th e sparse response categories may be collapsed 
to ensure there is sufficient data for analysis.  If the assumption of proportionality of odds is 
still violated in the collapsed categories then a partial proportional odds model may be 
considered. If any of t he above models fail to converge, then reduced versions may be 
considered.  A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) may also be considered as necessary.  
 
Comparison between the test lens and the control lens at the 2 -week follow -up will be carried 
out using two-sided 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios (Test over Control); where 
the odds ratio represents the odds of having a higher positive rating/experience for the Test 
lens compared to the Control lens.  
 
For driving items, n on-inferiority of the test lens relative to the control will be concluded if 
the lower limit of the 95%  confidence interval of the odds ratio is above 0.67. If non -inferiority 
is met, then superiority will be tested. Superiority of the test lens relative to the control lens 
will be concluded if the lower limit of the confidence interval of the odds ratio is above 1.  
 
 
CLUE Handling  
CLUE handling will be analyzed and tested in the same exact manner as CLUE comfort and 
vision as describe above in Section 14.5.  
 
Physiological Resp onses will be descriptively summarized for each lens type.  
14.8. Interim Analysis  
There will not be an interim analysis performed on this study.  
CR-[ADDRESS_989025] clinical trials don’t provide the evidence that subject dropout is systematic or not -at-
random. To evaluate the impact of missing data, sensitivity analysis will be conducted using 
multiple imputation methods if the proportion of subject dropout is greater than the 15%. The 
SAS/STAT procedures PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE will be utilized with  a parametric 
regression method used to make at least [ADDRESS_989026] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]/ARCHIVI NG 
15.1. Electronic Case Report Form/Data Collectio n 
The data for this study will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) using an EDC 
system (Bioclinica).   An authorized data originator will enter study data into the eCRFs using 
the EDC system. Data collected on equipment that is not captured in EDC will be formatted 
to the specification of the JJVC database manager and sent to JJVC for analysis.  
 
No externa l data will be collected of the study.  
 
The clinical data will be recorded on dedicated eCRFs specifically designed to match the 
study procedures for each visit.  Once completed, the eCRFs will be reviewed for accuracy 
and completeness and signed by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  The sponsor or sponsor’s representatives 
will be authorized to gain access to the subject recordation for the purposes of monitoring and 
auditing the study.  
 
Edit checks, electronic queries, and audit trails are built into the system to ensu re accurate and 
complete data collection. Data will be transmitted from the clinical site to a secure central 
database as forms are completed or updated, ensuring information accuracy, security, and 
confidentiality. After the final database lock, the Inves tigator will be provided with Individual 
Patient Profiles (IPP) including the full audit trail on electronic media in PDF format for all 
of the study data. The IPP must be retained in the study files as a certified copy of the source 
data for the study.

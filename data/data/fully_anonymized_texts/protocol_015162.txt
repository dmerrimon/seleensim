Page 2 of 17 Revised: December 1, [ZIP_CODE].0 Purpose  of the study: 
1.[ADDRESS_356867] a novel behavioral treatment – Unified 
Protocol Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (UP-CBT)1 – to enhance quality of life in women 
with pelvic floor disorders. Emotional distress is treatable using behavioral procedures, and 
effective treatment would increase women’s emotional health and help to reduce urinary 
symptoms (e.g., incontinence, frequent urination). Women with pelvic floor disorders are 
often seen in the urogynecology or urology clinic, which makes this setting ideal for 
offering additional interventions that may improve their quality of life. Unfortunately, 
many women with pelvic floor disorders may not receive effective behavioral treatment, 
such as cognitive behavior therapy, because urogynecologists, urologists, and other 
medical professionals may not be aware of providers in their community who offer this 
treatment. We will enhance treatment options by 1) providing evidence for an all-purpose 
cognitive-behavioral intervention (i.e., UP-CBT), 2) offering and integrating treatment in 
the medical clinic, maximizing convenience, and 3) improving clinical outcomes for these 
patients.

2. UP-CBT  will be compared to a control condition, supportive therapy. Supportive 
therapy, although often used in clinical settings (e.g., in support groups), is not 
expected to reduce anxiety, or urinary symptoms on average. Thus, we expect that 
the benefits of UP-CBT will be greater than benefits of the control therapy, 
supportive listening.
2.0 Background  / Literature Review / Rationale for the study:
2.1 Gaps in Current Knowledge
Urinary symptoms are common health issues  affecting an individual’s quality of 
life, including mental health. Urinary symptoms include urgency, frequency, incontinence, 
nocturia, and overactive bladder.[ADDRESS_356870] nearly one in four women.4 Women with incontinence are both more likely

Page 3 of 17 Revised: December 1, 2017to have  baseline emotional distress and to develop emotional distress as a result of their 
incontinence. Yet, current methods to treat incontinence do not address the emotional 
impact that urinary symptoms may have on women. In fact, one in five women will have 
surgery for these disorders with 30% needing a second surgery for the same condition.5,[ADDRESS_356871] millions of women. 
2.2 Background
This study  addresses how treatment of overall emotional distress affects anxiety, 
and in turn urinary symptoms. By [CONTACT_292430], this study will also give insight into emotional distress as a mechanism 
of urinary symptoms. Although there is a strong connection between emotional distress 
and urinary symptoms, evidence on their causal connections remain unexplored.7-11 
Furthermore, research on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for people with urinary 
symptoms is lacking. Our study will be the first to apply an empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported, 
transdiagnostic cognitive- and behaviorally-based treatment to women suffering from 
urinary symptoms, carried out in accord with high quality psychotherapy trials. The 
existing evidence base is limited to mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)12,13 and 
physical therapy techniques (e.g., pelvic floor exercises) as treatments for urinary 
symptoms, which did not address co-occurring symptoms of emotional distress. 
Cognitive-behavior therapy has  a well-developed protocol and thus can be 
administered to women of all ages, and of all economic backgrounds. The intervention is 
time-limited and low-cost, requiring only visits with the behavior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_102752] a low-cost 
workbook that is widely available. This project will also facilitate systemic change by 
[CONTACT_292431] a behavioral intervention directly to the woman, as opposed to asking the patient 
to schedule appointments in a different location. Delivering cognitive-behavior therapy in 
the medical setting, such as in primary care, has been used successfully in previous 
studies,14-[ADDRESS_356872] at Northwestern Medicine. This study can also 
bring systematic change to the practice of medicine by [CONTACT_292432] (i.e., UP-CBT) at the disposal of doctors who are treating women with pelvic 
floor disorders.
3.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria:
3.[ADDRESS_356873] and/or are taking 
medication for anxiety will be eligible for the study. Women must consent to 
randomization to treatment, and be willing to complete 12 sessions of treatment, as well as 
to complete baseline and outcome questionnaires. Women that screen positively for an 
alcohol or substance use disorder (based on the medical record) will be excluded from the 
study. Any women with blood in the urine, a positive urine culture, or other signs of 
possible infection will be deferred until they have been evaluated and treated as needed. 
Women who are pregnant or who have given birth within the past 6 months will be

Page 4 of 17 Revised: December 1, 2017excluded from  the study. Other exclusion criteria include serious disease that would impede 
participation (e.g., Alzheimer’s dementia, Parkinson’s disease); recent (within 6 months) 
pelvic or endoscopic surgery, urethral stricture, pelvic malignancy, current chemotherapy 
or other cancer therapy, pelvic device or implant complication; recent (within 12 months) 
Botox injection to the bladder or pelvic structures; or difficulties communicating in 
English. Women who are currently in their own psychotherapy are ineligible for the study.
In addition,  participants must be willing to defer from usual treatment for urinary 
problems until after completing the 12-week therapy intervention. For these women with 
lower urinary tract symptoms, there are multiple treatment options that can be tried 
sequentially, including the management of anxiety. Thus, if the person consents to be in 
the study, they will agree to these procedures before trying an alternative management 
strategy. Some alternatives include physical therapy (e.g., pelvic floor therapy), which can 
by [CONTACT_292433]/or painful, or even surgery, which has other complications. Thus, 
psychotherapy is a reasonable and viable alternative. Lower urinary tract symptoms are not 
life threatening, so waiting to start an alternate therapy will cause waiting for the 
participant, but no harm. The participant will of course have the choice not to agree to the 
study and pursue other treatments, or no treatment, if they wish. If a patient is eligible, they 
will then be given the opportunity to provide informed consent.

and medical history. Demographic data (e.g., age, date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, 
and insurance type) will be obtained from the patient’s electronic medical record, and 
verified via self-report. Demographic variables will likely be used as covariates in 
analyses. Results of physical examinations, particularly urological and gynecological 
history as well as urinary symptoms, will be used to determine inclusion criteria. History 
and diagnoses of serious illness that would preclude study participation will be extracted 
to determine exclusion criteria (see section 3.2 above).  In addition, substance and alcohol 
use history and diagnoses will be accessed through Epic to establish the exclusion 
criterion of substance use disorder. Lastly, mental health history and diagnoses will be 
pulled from Epic for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and to provide background information 
for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 
8.3 Measures
Participants will  be asked to complete questionnaires at baseline, mid-treatment 
(after 6 sessions), posttreatment (after 12 sessions), at a 3-month follow-up, and at a 6-

sent via email. The primary outcome tool for this study will be the six-item Urinary Distress 
Inventory (UDI-6), which is a subscale of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI), as 
measure of urinary symptoms.25 We will also measure anxiety using a short form from the 
NIH Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), which has 
been shown to be reliable and valid;26 this form is brief and easy to complete. Secondary 
measures include the PROMIS profile27 (depression, fatigue, pain, physical function, sleep 
disturbance, and social roles), trauma history assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-
[ADDRESS_356880] (PCL-5),28 the Mini-IPIP, a 20-item short form of the 
International Personality Item Pool measure of the Big Five personality traits,29 the 
Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) short form,30 and the Patient Global Impression of 
Improvement (PGI-I) – a one item self-report assessment of improvement of urinary 
symptoms.[ADDRESS_356881] received any treatment outside of the study for their urinary symptoms and/or 
their anxiety. Any treatment participants receive outside of the study will be tracked in this 
manner and included in data analyses.

Page 8 of 17 Revised: December 1, [ZIP_CODE].4 Therapy
Participants will  be scheduled to come to an individual treatment session once per 
week for 12 weeks, at a convenient time for them, on the Northwestern Campus. This 
arrangement allows for a one-stop experience for the patient, maximizing their 
convenience. As described above, participants will be randomized to one of two therapy 
conditions: UP-CBT or supportive therapy. All sessions, in both conditions, will be 45 
minutes in duration. If a participant happens to miss or cancel a session they will be 
rescheduled. 
Unified-Protocol Cognitive  Behavior Therapy (UP-CBT) is a form of therapy that 
draws upon various forms of cognitive-behavior therapy to “unify” the most important 
tools into one protocol. Cognitive-behavior therapy has been a leading treatment for 
depression and anxiety for decades, but historically has focused on specific disorders (e.g., 
major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder). UP-CBT includes a variety of 
general-purpose techniques to help people cope more skillfully with emotionally stressful 
situations. This includes dealing with emotional situations by [CONTACT_292434] (e.g., “If I get nervous at work, the stress I feel will be temporary and won’t kill 
me” rather than “I can’t deal with my life”). UP-CBT focuses on dealing with stress in 
general, but its techniques are readily adaptable to dealing with urinary symptoms. For 
example, a woman might have catastrophic thinking about urine leakage (“What if 
someone notices that I’ve leaked?”). These catastrophic thoughts can result in strong fear 
responses, as well as potentially problematic behaviors (e.g., avoidance of social situations 
or even skippi[INVESTIGATOR_292409]). In general, UP-CBT teaches people to track emotions, thoughts, 
and behavior in an effort to identify maladaptive patterns. In addition, participants learn to 
restructure their thoughts, and to more confidently confront situations that they find 
challenging. Towards the end of treatment, patients learn to prevent relapses through 
practice of therapy skills. Participants in the UP-CBT group will be asked to complete 
homework outside of the therapy session, to practice therapy skills. Homework will be 
completed in their therapy workbook, and they will be instructed to bring their workbook 
to each session. After completing the [ADDRESS_356883] as pi[INVESTIGATOR_292410]. As such, it is an excellent control condition because it is not merely “sham 10 min X

Page 9 of 17 Revised: December 1, 2017therapy”. Supportive  therapy is widely-used in clinical community settings. In this 
condition, no cognitive-behavioral exercises will be used. Supportive Therapy allows for 
careful control over the number of therapy sessions and time per session. Thus, it is ideal 
for being able to match to UP-CBT. The protocol for supportive therapy will include 1) 
education about urinary symptoms, anxiety, and depression, 2) discussion of patient goals, 
3) sharing of concerns in a nonjudgmental environment, 4) discussion of the possible 
connections between urinary symptoms and emotional distress, and 5) reflective listening. 
Participants in supportive therapy will not be given homework.

8.5 Analysis Plan
Primary analyses . We will create hierarchical linear models (HLM) to test the primary 
hypotheses of  the study. One model will determine the effect of type of therapy on anxiety. 
A separate model will determine the effect of type of therapy on urinary symptoms. The 
dependent variables for these models will be the UDI-6 subscale of the PFDI-20 and 
anxiety as measured by [CONTACT_292435]-29. The structure of 
the HLM model is shown below. Note that these models create a response profile for each 
person across all time points as described in the protocol.
Level 1 
Y = P0 + P1(T2) + P2(T3) + P3(T4) + P4(T5) + E
Level 2
P0 = B00 + B01(Condition)
P1 = B10 + B11(Condition) + R1
P2 = B20 + B21(Condition) + R2
P3 = B30 + B31(Condition) + R3
P4= B40 + B41(Condition) + R4
The dummy  variables P1-P4 are dummy codes for the five time points. These will 
allow us to determine the degree of change from baseline. Each of the “P” coefficients is 
influenced by [CONTACT_292436]-2 variables. T2 - T5 are dummy variables of the time differences from 
baseline. E, R1-R4 represent error terms in the model. Condition will be dummy coded 
(UP-CBT = 1, Supportive Therapy = 0).
Testing Key  endpoints. We have two primary endpoints and therefore we will have two 
models. For both anxiety  (PROMIS T score) and urinary symptoms (UDI-6), the full model 
(see above) will be compared to a reduced model with all of the terms involving condition 
removed (i.e., B01, B11, B21, B31, and B41). If this comparison is significant (p < .05), 
then we will test individual parameters at a Type I error rate of alpha = .05 (two-tailed). 
Note, these tests will only be carried out if the full-reduced model comparison is 
IRB #: STU00207124-MOD0010 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 6/13/2019 through 3/3/2020.
Page 10 of 17 Revised: December 1, 2017significant. The  key prediction for anxiety is that parameters B21, B31, and B41 
(representing the effect of UP-CBT at post-treatment and beyond) will be significant and 
negative (representing fewer symptoms). The key prediction for urinary symptoms is that 
parameters B21, B31, and B41 (representing the effect of UP-CBT at post-treatment and 
beyond) will be significant and negative (representing fewer symptoms).
Missing data. All participants with baseline data will be included in the modeling using 
an intent-to-treat approach. The HLM approach described above can accommodate cases 
with missing follow-up data.
Mediation analysis . We will also carry out mediation analysis in Mplus using bias-correct 
bootstrapped 95%  confidence intervals. We will hypothesize that these confidence 
intervals will not contain zero for the following mediated effects:
Condition   Mid-treatment anxiety  Post-treatment urinary symptoms
Condition   Post-treatment anxiety  3-month urinary symptoms
Condition   3-month anxiety  6-month urinary symptoms
In addition to  testing statistical significance, our hypothesis is directional. Condition (i.e., 
receiving UP-CBT) should lead to lower anxiety, in turn leading to lower urinary 
symptoms.
Exploratory analyses . Although our primary focus is anxiety and urinary symptoms, we 
will conduct HLM  analyses on each scale of the PROMIS Profile (depression, fatigue, 
sleep, pain interference, pain, social function) and other subscales of the PFDI (total score, 
colorectal symptoms, pelvic organ prolapse symptoms). These analyses will be clearly 
marked as exploratory in all write-ups. We will also create a prediction model of treatment 
response (i.e., trajectory of symptoms) based on baseline characteristics. These will also 
be clearly marked as exploratory in all study write-ups.

There is  no deception involved in this study. Participants will be made aware that 
they will be randomized to one of two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
10.0 Recruitment  Methods:
Participants will  be recruited by [CONTACT_292437]. If an IPHP 
clinician identifies a patient as meeting the eligibility criteria, a research coordinator will

Page 11 of 17 Revised: December 1, 2017be called  in to speak with the participant about the study. Coordinators will follow a 
recruitment script. In addition, recruitment flyers and postcards will be placed in the 
waiting area of the IPHP, and will be shared with IPHP clinicians. 
11.0 Consent  Process: 
The consent  process will be carried out by [CONTACT_292438]. 
Written informed consent including HIPAA authorization will be obtained at same visit as 
screening and determination of eligibility. All participants will be asked about their 
understanding of their participation, and will have an opportunity to ask questions about 
the study prior to agreeing to participate. Participants will be free to consult with others 
(e.g., family members) prior to providing informed consent. Participants will provide 
written informed consent before beginning the study. Participants will be informed that 
they are free to withdraw from the study at any time without consequence. Ongoing consent 
will not be formally assessed after participants provide informed consent, but research team 
members will be trained to discuss any questions that may arise and what to do if a 
participant chooses to withdraw from the study. See consent form attachment. 
12.0 Financial  Compensation:
Each participant, irrespective  of treatment group, will be compensated $100. 
Participant payment will occur in three blocks: once they have completed the 12 therapy 
sessions they will receive $70 total ($5 per session, with a $10 bonus for completing all 12 
sessions), then they will receive an additional $15 for each follow-up assessment. 
Compensation will be prorated to $[ADDRESS_356887] (Visa) for 
therapy sessions and via virtual gift card for online follow-up surveys. If a participant 
withdraws from the study they will be given the option to receive their pro-rated payment 
either via Stored Value Card or virtual gift card based on their preference.
13.0 Audio  Recording:
Audio recording  of therapy sessions will be optional. For participants that provide 
consent for audio recordings, therapy sessions will be audio recorded to be reviewed later 
by [CONTACT_458], to ensure fidelity of treatment and for supervision of 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Recording devices will be stored in a locked cabinet in [CONTACT_292444]’s lab space.

14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants: 
Participants will  not necessarily benefit from taking part in this research. However, 
possible benefits include: 1) We can improve behavioral treatment for patients with lower 
urinary tract symptoms and comorbid emotional distress. 2) This study will provide 
important information about the causal link between emotional distress and urinary 
symptoms. 3) Participants may directly experience a reduction in their urinary symptoms 
and emotional distress. The potential benefits of this study should outweigh the risk to 
individual participants.

Page 12 of 17 Revised: December 1, 201715.0 Risks  to Participants:
Participating in  this study involves minimal risks. It is possible that participants 
may feel some shame, emotional discomfort, distress, boredom/fatigue when completing 
the assessments of urinary symptoms, depression, and anxiety, or when participating in 
therapy. If we find that participants in the study are at risk for harming themselves or others, 
we will follow the protocol to connect the participant with crisis services, and document 
the situation accordingly. We will inform participants that their participation in this study 
may result in a loss of privacy. This includes data from questionnaires entered into a 
computerized database, questionnaires completed online, as well as written therapy notes. 
Several steps will be taken to protect confidentiality and minimize the above risks.
If a  participant withdraws from any part of the study (e.g., does not complete one 
of the surveys), they are welcome to participate in other aspects of the study. If a participant 
chooses to withdraw from the study, data that has been collected during their participation 
will be analyzed unless the participant specifies otherwise. 
16.[ADDRESS_356888] the Privacy and Confidentiality of Participants and the 
Research Data:
Participants will  provide written informed consent. Participants will be given a 
copy of the consent materials for their records. To protect confidentiality, participants will 
not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], but by a unique participant identification number. The key 
linking participant name [CONTACT_292441] a password-protected 
file. Any other identifying information (e.g., contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be kept separate 
from the research data. All information, data, and recordings will be kept in secure, 
password-protected files. Any physical data and forms (e.g., consent) will be kept in a 
locked cabinet in a locked room. We will inform participants that unless required by [CONTACT_2371], 
only the research team and representatives of the Institutional Review Board have the 
authority to review any study records. All parties with access to the data will be required 
to maintain confidentiality. Using trained graduate students as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292413]. Further,

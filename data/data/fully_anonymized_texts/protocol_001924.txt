[ADDRESS_487538] treatments (medication and psychotherapy); however, a 
significant subset of depressed patients (15-20%) do not respond to these treatments and are referred to as 
treatment-resistant major depression (TRMD). New treatments for TRMD are needed, and one promising line 
of research are drugs known as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists. In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], our group demonstrated that the NMDA antagonist nitrous oxide (N 2O) is effective in TRMD, however, 
the dose concentration of nitrous oxide to have antidepressant effects is unknown. Therefore, we propose 
conducting a randomized, placebo controlled double-blind crossover (x2) study in which treatment-resistant 
depression patients will all receive 3 randomized, one hour nitrous oxide inhalation sessions of placebo (0% 
N2O), 25% N 2O (low dose), and 50% N 2O (high dose). We aim to compare nitrous oxide’s relative 
antidepressant efficacy of two doses of N 2O by [CONTACT_388885], but not inhaled 
placebo, will significantly show rapid and sustained antidepressant effects.

 SYNOPSIS 
 
Study Title Inhaled Nitrous Oxide for Treatment-Resistant Depression: Optimizing Dosing Strategies 
Objective This study aims to determine whether different concentrations of nitrous oxide (N 2O) have 
different antidepressant effects for adults with treatment-resistant major depression.  
Study Period Planned enrollment duration: Approximately 2 years 
Planned study duration: Approximately 18 weeks 
Number of 
Patients 40 
Study Drug Nitrous oxide (laughing gas). This is an FDA-approved general anesthetic and sedative agent used 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83570]. The use of nitrous oxide in this protocol is off-label and outside of 
the approved indication. Nitrous oxide will be administered under supervision of an attending-
level anesthesiologist and using standard anesthesia equipment (mobile anesthesia machine/FDA-
approved nitrous oxide delivery system, standard monitoring, oxygen, rescue equipment). 
Study Design Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over (x2) trial.  All patients will receive 3 
randomized, one hour N 2O inhalations to placebo (0% N 2O), low dose (25% N 2O), and high dose 
(50% N 2O).  Inhalation sessions will be at least [ADDRESS_487539]-inhalation for each dose.

 1. Specific Aims 
1.1.  To demonstrate that both low and high concentrations of nitrous oxide will show equivalent and 
superior antidepressant effects relative to placebo at immediate (2 hours) and sustained (24 hours) time 
points. 
1.2.  To compare the sustained antidepressant effect of low and high concentrations of inhaled nitrous oxide 
at 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_487540]-inhalation. We hypothesize that for both low and high doses, antidepressant 
effects will be attenuated at 1 and 2 weeks, and will dissipate by [CONTACT_32205]. 
 
2. Background 
It is estimated that as many as 16 million Americans suffer from major depressive disorder (MDD). Fifty 
percent fail an initial pharmacotherapy trial and ~30% fail a series of treatment trials [1], and are referred to as 
“Treatment-Resistant Major Depression” (TRMD). TRMD exacts a high toll on treatment resources and studies 
suggest that patients with TRMD place an unusually heavy burden on total MDD costs (suicide, personal 
financial costs, loss of work, medical co-morbidity [2, 3]). Unfortunately, knowledge regarding the best 
treatments for TRMD remains incomplete.  
 
Studies demonstrate that there are limited effective antidepressant treatments for TRMD. Evidence shows that 
only four treatment approaches are effective in MDD after two sequential ineffective antidepressant trials: 
lithium augmentation, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, electroconvulsive therapy, and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709] 
(e.g. aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; [3]). To address this problem, the NIMH sponsored the largest sequential 
antidepressant trial (STAR*D). Following four levels of adequate dose-duration medications, ~36% of patients 
failed to remit [1]. The STAR*D trial concluded that a significant proportion of MDD patients do NOT achieve 
remission and constitute TRMD. With few exceptions, the majority of existing antidepressant treatments act via 
mechanisms discovered over three decades ago. Hence, antidepressant treatments with alternate mechanisms 
of action are needed. 
 
Over the past [ADDRESS_487541] ketamine is an effective, 
rapid onset antidepressant in TRMD [4]. Most noteworthy, these studies suggest that ketamine acts 
immediately, producing an antidepressant response in less than [ADDRESS_487542] advantage to existing 
antidepressant medications, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_19236] 4-6 weeks to effectively decrease depressive symptoms. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_388879], this compound carries significant limitations: it 
is associated with psychosis, high addiction potential, and potential cognitive impairment [5-8].  
 
Nitrous oxide (N 2O), an odorless, colorless gas typi[INVESTIGATOR_388880], is an NMDA receptor 
antagonist [9]. Our group recently completed the first study of N 2O in TRMD patients [10]. Using a double-
5 
 blind, crossover design, we found that TRMD patients receiving a one hour session of inhaled N 2O (50% N 2O 
in 50% oxygen) versus placebo (50% nitrogen in 50% oxygen) experienced a significant decrease in MDD 
symptoms at 2 and 24 hours after inhalation, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-21 item (HDRS-
21). Mean HDRS score differences at 2 hours: -4.8 points, p=0.002; and 24 hours: -5.5 points, p<0.001). Four 
patients (20%) had treatment response (HDRS reduction ≥50%) and three patients (15%) a full remission 
(HDRS ≤7 points) after N 2O, compared to one patient (5%) and none after placebo (odds ratio [OR] for 
response 4.0, 95% CI 0.45–35.8; OR for remission 3.0, 95% CI 0.31– 28.8). No serious adverse events 
occurred; however, two patients experienced panic attacks/anxiety onset, suggesting that the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_696] N 2O 
concentration may have been too high . Importantly, the N 2O dose in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (50% N 2O in 50% oxygen) 
was based on its use in dentistry because no prior information about N 2O in TRMD existed. 
 
Preclinical studies suggest that different doses of ketamine are associated with variable NMDA receptor and 
antidepressant activity. In single neurons, 50% N 2O blocks >50% of NMDA receptors, whereas ketamine 
concentrations achieved in depression studies likely block ~25-35% of NMDA responses [11]. Thus, it is 
possible that a lower inspi[INVESTIGATOR_388881] N 2O (25%) will have substantial antidepressant effect while 
also reducing the risk of paradoxical anxiety. 
 
We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_97576] a double-blind, crossover (x 2), placebo-controlled design to determine whether different concentrations of N 2O have different antidepressant effects. We hypothesize that 25% and 
50% N 2O, as compared to placebo, will have equivalent antidepressant effects. Further, we predict that these 
effects will occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (2 hours) and be sustained (24 hours, one and two weeks), but will attenuate by [CONTACT_388888]. 
 
3. Drug Information 
Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a colorless, odorless gas. Nitrous oxide is the oldest and most widely used FDA-
approved anesthetic gas. It is commonly used as a component of general anesthesia and as a sedative/analgesic 
agent used in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_83570]. The onset as well as offset of effect is within a few minutes. Nitrous 
oxide is the least potent of inhalational anesthetics. Concentrations above 1 atm are theoretically needed to 
produce complete general anesthesia when nitrous oxide is used as a sole agent. Therefore, concentrations 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_83576] (50%) in dentistry and pediatrics achieve only mild to moderate sedation (but potent analgesia) 
and are not sufficient to produce general anesthesia. Well-known side effects include euphoria, sedation, nausea 
and vomiting, inactivation of vitamin B 12 (commensurate with the duration of exposure and concentration used). 
In general, exposure to 25-50% nitrous oxide for 1 hour is considered extremely safe. The use of nitrous oxide 
in this protocol is off-label and outside of the approved indication.

5. Enrollment 
Participants will be recruited in part through the Volunteer for Health registry at Washington University School 
of Medicine and the Washington University TRMD Database (120+ individuals with TRMD carefully screened 
over the past [ADDRESS_487543]; IRB# 201102247). Eligible and interested participants will be 
consented for participation and enrolled in the study by [CONTACT_3462]. We will recruit a total of [ADDRESS_487544] 4 weeks. Inhalations will include 
exposure to placebo (0% N 2O), 25% N 2O (low dose), and 50% N 2O (high dose). Mood will be assessed at 
baseline (immediate pre-treatment), immediate ([ADDRESS_487545]-inhalation), sustained (24 hours) and at one and two 
weeks, and one month. We will also assess for potential psychiatric side effects including psychosis and 
disassociation. 
 
There will be up to 14 study visits involved with participation. The screening visit (Visit 1) will be used to 
verify eligibility and collect background information.  
 
Specifically, we will collect patient demographic information, medical history, vital signs and a research team 
member will perform a physical exam.  A urine sample will be collected for drug, and an optional blood draw 
may be collected if the study physician requests tests to confirm participants’ safety to participate.  Psychiatric 
assessments (completed by [CONTACT_388890]) will be performed to assess 
for major depression, other mental health diagnoses including significant anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, and psychosis or dissociation. 
 
Visit 2 may directly follow Visit 1 on the same day, if needed.  Visit 2 (Baseline visit) will ask participants to 
fill out several mood-based questionnaires, pass a urine pregnancy screen (Baseline visit only), receive a total of 
[ADDRESS_487546] vital signs taken and mood questionnaires asked. Visits 4 and 5 will occur 1 and 2 
week(s), respectively, after inhalation session one, and involve asking participants about their mood and mental 
state. Visit 6 will occur 4 weeks after inhalation session one, and will include questionnaires to account for a 4 
week follow up and also a baseline visit for the next gas concentration.  The procedures for Visit 6 will be 
identical to Visit 2 (besides urine pregnancy screen) with gas inhalation and mood-based questionnaires before 
and [ADDRESS_487547]. Optional labs may be 
ordered by [CONTACT_388891] a patient.  These screening labs might include but 
are not limited to a comprehensive blood panel and a complete blood count. 
Patients will be reimbursed with $5 + parking for each visit completed after the Screening Visit for their 
expenses and time commitment.  If a participant completes all visits they will receive $65.  Otherwise if the 
participant ends participation before the study visits are complete, the participant will be compensated $5 for 
each visit they did complete. 
 
6.2. Randomization The order of the 3 inhalation sessions will be randomly assigned for each patient by a random number 
generator.  
 
6.3. Blinding Patients will be blinded to the group assignment. Nitrous oxide is a colorless and odorless gas which makes it 
unlikely for patients to identify the group assignment. Likewise, the study setup will be identical for both 
sessions, which will make an inadvertent unblinding of the study unlikely. For the team responsible for the 
administration of the nitrous oxide treatment, the group assignment will be known. This team is completely 
separate from the team assessing the study outcomes which will be blinded to the group assignment. Treatment 
administration and outcomes assessment may also be physically separated in different rooms within the study 
facility.   
  
In addition, after each inhalation session, subjects will be asked whether they thought they received the active 
nitrous oxide gas or the placebo gas. Responses will be recorded with an assessment (5 point scale) asking 
participants to rate the extent to which they knew they were exposed to nitrous oxide; 1) strongly believe the 
treatment was nitrous oxide, 2) somewhat believe the treatment was nitrous oxide, 3) somewhat believe the 
treatment was placebo, 4) strongly believe the treatment is placebo, and, 5) don’t know. 
 
6.4. Setting The inhalation sessions will be performed in Barnes-Jewish-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) suite 
within Washington University. The procedure room used is equipped with vital sign monitoring, resuscitation 
equipment and devices, and has oxygen wall outlets. As part of the standard setup, a mobile FDA-approved 
nitrous oxide delivery system will be used or an anesthesia machine.    
 
  
9 
 6.5. Study Procedures 
Except for the choice of gas (either nitrous oxide concentration or nitrogen [inert]; all mixed with 50% oxygen) 
treatment sessions will be identical. The gas mix will be administered via a standard anesthesia facemask 
through tubing connected to the anesthesia machine or via a facemask which is connected via hose to an FDA-
approved Porter/Praxair MXR breathing circuit. A small sample connector line will be inserted into the 
facemask which allows the measurement of inhaled and exhaled gas concentrations. Inhaled and exhaled gas 
concentrations of nitrous oxide, oxygen and nitrogen will be monitored and adjusted according to protocol. 
Total gas flow will be 2-8 L/min.  
 
Patients will be monitored during and after the treatment according to American Society of Anesthesiologists 
standard which include continuous 3-lead ECG, pulsoximetry, non-invasive blood pressure and endtidal CO [ADDRESS_487548] the suite.  
 
 
7. Data Collection 
7.1. Follow-Up Data will be examined from baseline (prior to each inhalation session) to immediate ([ADDRESS_487549]-inhalation) 
and sustained ([ADDRESS_487550]-inhalation) effects versus compared to each other and the placebo gas.  Additional 
follow-up visits will be scheduled approximately 1, 2, and 4 weeks following completion of each gas inhalation 
session (to assess for treatment efficacy and also duration of efficacy of nitrous oxide effects).   
 
7.2. Assessment of Treatment Efficacy 
The effects of the inhalation gases on behavioral and mood state will be assessed using standard scales used in 
clinical psychiatry:  
 Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  21 items (HDRS-21) scale ( Primary Outcome ) 
 Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
 Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) 
 Clinical Administered Dissociative States Scale 28 item (CADSS-28) 
 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale  (BPRS) 
 Profile of Mood States 2nd Edition (POMS-2) 
Patients will be assessed at all time points by [CONTACT_388892].  
10 
 Additionally, adequacy of the blind will be assessed by a Blinding Questionnaire given after completion of each 
inhalation session (see Section 6.3).  
 
7.3. Assessment of Treatment Safety Treatment safety will be monitored at several levels: adverse events (AE) related to (i) cardiovascular status; (ii) 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]; (iii) central nervous system; and (iv) psychiatric symptoms, particularly the presence of 
psychotic symptoms.  
(i) Cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and other AEs will be identified clinically by [CONTACT_388893]. Follow up recommendations will be given as needed, if necessary, by [CONTACT_25617]. 
 (ii) Psychiatric AEs, such as psychotic and dissociative symptoms, will be assessed via clinical interview as 
well as via standard scales before and after inhalation sessions. Emergence of psychosis will be identified 
by [CONTACT_388894] (for psychotic symptoms); suicidal ideation/intention 
will be assessed clinically and via the suicide questions on the QIDS-SR (question #3) and the HDRS-[ADDRESS_487551] Operating Procedures (SOPs) for clinical 
research. All individuals working under the PI [INVESTIGATOR_388882]. The PI's SOPs are in part developed from and are compliant with the Institutional guidelines, including 
those for a) Interactions with the Washington University Human Subjects Review Committee, b) Informed 
Consent Development and Implementation, c) Subject Recruitment and Screening, d)  Subject Management 
While on Study, e) Adverse Event Reporting. 
 
8.2. The specific monitoring plan for this study is commensurate with the risks and the size and complexity 
of the investigations planned.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_388883]. The potential risks are 
attributable to the use of the gas mixtures or emotional discomfort while completing the 
assessments/questionnaires.   
 
  
11 
 9. Data Analysis  
Major depressive disorder symptoms will be evaluated at baseline (pre-inhalation), at [ADDRESS_487552]-inhalation.  Later time points will assess for duration of sustained antidepressant effects (Aim 2).  
 
Secondary MDD measures taken at the same time points, will include the MADRS, the QIDS-SR, and the POMS 2 (immediate subjective mood change). At the same time points, euphoria, psychosis (BPRS), and 
disassociation (CADSS) will also be measured.  Outcomes will be analyzed with a repeated measures mixed 
effects linear model using restricted maximum likelihood estimation.  To adjust for the observed carryover 
effect, the model will include a randomization group term and a three-way interaction (treatment x time x 
randomization group). To compare response and remission rates (≥50% decrease, ≤7 on HDRS-21, 
respectively), an exact binomial test will be used (and corresponding odds ratios [ORs] calculated). Symmetry 
and spectral power will be assessed from EEG acquired during periods of eye closure or opening. 
 
Power Analysis Our original pi[INVESTIGATOR_388884] 20 subjects. Based on the 
assumption that the low N2O concentration (25%) is non-inferior to the high N 2O concentration, 24 patients 
will be required with a power of 90% to show that the lower limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or 
equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit of -3 points on the 
HDRS with an expected SD of 2.5.  
 
10. Risk Assessment 
10.1. Nitrous Oxide The side effects of nitrous oxide are well known to all anesthesiologists. The dose (25% or 50%) and duration 
(1 hour) used in this protocol are considered extremely safe and of low risk. Similar doses and durations are 
used in everyday dental practice without vital sign monitoring or supervision by a resuscitation-trained 
physician. The gas inhalation will be administered under supervision of an attending-level anesthesiologist and 
according to standards set by [CONTACT_388895], which includes monitoring via: 3-lead 
ECG, pulsoximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, and end-tidal CO 2. With this dose of nitrous oxide, sedation 
may occur but not general anesthesia or respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. Previous evidence shows that the inactivating 
effect of nitrous oxide on vitamin B 12 is dose and duration-dependent and are minor when used as in this 
protocol. An increase in plasma homocysteine by +25% can be expected which is expected to revert to baseline 
within the next 24 hours. Minor side effects after nitrous oxide exposure such as nausea and vomiting may 
occur which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_115216]-limited and short. If a patient develops moderate to severe nausea and vomiting, 
we may administer 4mg of ondansetron. After the inhalation treatment sessions, clinical and nursing staff will 
12 
 continue to be present to monitor patients’ symptoms and state before discharging the patient. Blood pressure 
and heart rate are also checked at the 22-[ADDRESS_487553] before the study, and close clinical scrutiny during all aspects of the study.

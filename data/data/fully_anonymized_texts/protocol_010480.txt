SYNOPSIS   
Title of study:  
A Phase  2 Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled , Proof of Concept  Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of Antroquinonol in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135582] -19 
Indication:  
Mild to moderate pneumonia due to CO ronaVIrus D isease 2019 (COVID -19) 
Number of investigators and study centers:  
Approximately 15 to 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002] , and other countries based on the pandemic situation.  
Development phase:  
Phase  2 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is : 
• To evaluate the efficacy of antroquinonol treatment of mild to moderate pneumonia due to COVID -19, 
as measured by [CONTACT_135662][INVESTIGATOR_1399] (ie,  no need for invasive 
mechanical ventilation, non -invasive ventilation, high -flow oxygen, or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation [ ECMO ]) on Day 14  
The secondary objectives are:  
• To further evaluate the efficacy of antroquinonol compared with placebo in this pat ient population as 
measured by:  
o World Health Organization (WHO) COVID -19 Clinical Improvement Ordinal Scale score on 
Days  7, 14, and 28  
o Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135583]  28 
o Virological clearance on Days 5, 14, and  28 
o Vital status (death) on Days 7, 14,  and 28 
o Duration of intensive care unit ( ICU) stay up to Day  28 
o Proportion of patients alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135584] 7 and 28 
o COVID -19 symptoms  on Days 7,  14, and 28  
• To evaluate the safety of antroquinonol treatment in patients with mild to  moderate pneumonia due to 
COVID -19. 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics  (PK) of antroquinonol in a subset of 20 patients  (first [ADDRESS_153924] 10 patients to placebo)  
The exploratory objective  is to further evaluate efficacy via supportive analyses of : 
• To further evaluate efficacy via supportive analyses of:  
o Subgroup analyses of selected covariates  
o Impact on efficacy of any new authorized treatments recommended as standard of care ( SoC) for 
COVID -19 during the course of the study . 
Methodology/study design:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, Phase  2, proof of concept  study in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135585] -19. Written informed consent must be obtained from all 
patients during screening (Days  -2 to 0). Following completion of all screening assessments and meeting of 
eligibility criteria, patients will either receive antroquinonol or placebo for 1 4 days in combination with SoC 
therapy per local SoC policies. 
A total of 174 patients are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to antroquinonol or placebo.

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_153925] of a sentinel cohort of 20  patients (10  patients randomized to antroquinonol and 10  patients 
to placebo), and an expansion cohort of 154 patients (77 patients in each treatment group). Enrollment will pause 
after the 20th patient in the sentinel cohort has been enrolled and started treatment, until the results of the interim 
analysis  1 are known. Once the 20th patient in the sentinel cohort has completed 14 days of treatment, an 
unblinded Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK of  100 mg 
twice daily (BID) antroquinonol in COVID -19 patients in the sentinel cohort (in terim analysis 1) . The DMC will 
issue a recommendation to enroll patients for the expansion cohort, or to stop the study depending on the safety 
and futility assessment. Once the 80th patient has been enrolled, and completed 14  days of treatment, the DMC 
will review the safety , tolerability , and efficacy data (interim analysis  2). Enrollment may be restricted at the 
100th patient until the DMC has completed the assessment to prevent excessive enrol lment. The DMC will 
continue to review safety and assess the  risk/benefit profile on an ongoing basis. A DMC Charter, which includes 
detailed processes, will be prepared.  
Patients will undergo assessment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135586] 2 if judged to b e ready for discharge. If discharged, patients will then be requested to take study 
treatment at home (as prescribed) up to Day 14. End of Treatment assessments at Day 14 (+2 days) (at home or site visit) will be performed.  A Day 5  (+/- 1 day)  visit (at home or site  visit) will be performed  if the patient is 
discharged prior to Day  5. If the patient is discharged after completion of treatment and before the follow -up 
visit, he/she will be followed up on Day 28 (±2 days) for study assessments ( a telephone or  telemedicine visit). 
Post discharge, assessments will be done by [CONTACT_135663] , except for Day 5, Day 14, and Early 
Termination  (ET) of Study Treatment . If the discharge, ET, or Early Withdrawal visit fall s within the window of 
a schedule Day visit, the assessments for the visits can be combined as one visit . On days of laboratory 
assessments, discharged patients will have a home visit. On days of no laboratory assessments, discharged patients will complete their assessments via telephone , telemedicine , or other means of remote communication. 
Additionally, patients will receive a diary to capture all doses  after a discharge.  
Number of patients:  
A total of 174 patients are planned to be randomized into the study:  
• 20 patients in th e sentinel cohort  (10 patients in each treatment group ) 
• 154 patients in the expansion cohort ( 77 patients  in each treatment group ). 
This enrollment level ensures 80% power to demonstrate proof of concept efficacy with one -sided alpha of 0.2. 
The sample size is based on the following assumptions:  
• The randomized allocation ratio is 1:1 between the antroquinonol  group and the placebo group 
• The proportion of patients alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135587] 78% on placebo vs 89% on antroquinonol  
• The following nonbinding rules will be considered by [CONTACT_135664], and the DMC will not make 
any recommendations to stop for early efficacy:  
o Interim analysis 1 (sentinel cohort): An odds ratio of 3.5 on the primary endpoint in favor of 
placebo . 
o Interim analysis 2: An odds ratio of 1.2 on the primary endpoint in favor of placebo . This 
analysis will be conducted on all data collected up to the 80
th randomized patient  completing 14 
days of treatment. Enrollment may be restricted at the 100th patient until the DMC has 
completed the assessment to prevent excessive enrolment.  
Diagnosis and criteria for inclusion and exclusion:  
Patients must satisfy all of the following inclusion criteria at the Screening visit unless otherwise stated:

stratified by [CONTACT_135669] -19 use at baseline and by [CONTACT_23276] 
(≤65  years vs >65 years).  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
• Clinical improvement measured as a score on the WHO COVID -19 Clinical Improvement Ordinal Scale  
will be analyzed at each timepoint, adjusted for the clinical improvement score at baseline, age at 
baseline , and remdesivir or other authorized treatments for COVID -19 use at baseline, using an ordinal 
logistic regression on Days 7, 14 , and 28. In addition, descriptive statistics will be provided for average 
score, and the proportion of patients at or below each score, at each timepoint. Time to 2- point 
improvem ent from baseline in WHO COVID- 19 Clinical Improvement score, time to score of 2 or 
lower, and time to score of 0, will also be analyzed.  
• The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval for time to event outcomes will be estimated by [CONTACT_135670], with patients censored at the time they are provided any antiviral therapy  not 
prescribed at baseline, or on Day [ADDRESS_153934] not yet recovered. Patients who die at any time will be considered not yet recovered by [CONTACT_2006] 28. Median time to 2- point  improvement , time to  score of 2 or 
lower, and time to score of 0 will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier (KM) method, and the KM curve will 
be provided. The p- value for comparison between groups will be obtained based on proportional hazards 
modeling stratified by [CONTACT_135671] . 
• Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135593]  [ADDRESS_153935] died will be considered as cont inuing 
to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135594] 28 for the purposes of this analysis . 
• Time to virological clearance, measured as study days from start of treatment to first negative 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_153936] died will be considered as not having cleared the virus by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  
• Rate of change in viral load will be summarized descriptively and estimated using a Mixed Model for 
Repeated Measurements model. The model will include the treatment group, age, remdesivir or other authorized treatments for COVID -19 use at baseline, visit, and the interaction between visit and the 
treatment group as fixed factors, and will include the baseline value as a covariate. 
• Proportion of patients with vital status of death in both groups on Days 7, 14, and 28 will be analyzed 
using logistic regression stratified by [CONTACT_135671].  
• Proportion of patients  alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135584] 7 and 28 wil l be compared using the 
same analysis as the primary endpoint.  
• COVID -[ADDRESS_153937] on efficacy of any new authorized treatments recommended as SoC for COVID -19 
during the course of the study will also be evaluated.  
Safety Analysis:  
Adverse events will be coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  version 23.0 dated 
19 April 2020 (exclusively meant for COVID -19), or later . 
The number and percentage of patients with treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), serious AEs (SAEs), TEAEs 
related to study treatment, SAEs related to study treatment, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinua tion, and 
TEAEs leading to death will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred term (PT) , and treatment 
group. In addition, the severity of TEAEs and relationship to study treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and treatment group.  
Test value s and change from baseline will be summarized descriptively for specific laboratory test results, vital 
signs, and complete physical examination , ECG , and chest imaging (x‑ray or CT scan) findings . Where 
applicable, shift tabulations by [CONTACT_2058].

treatment of mild to moderate pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_4113]-19. 
Considering the antiviral and anti- inflammatory activity of antroquinonol and known safety 
profile to date, this study will assess the safety and efficacy of antroquinonol for the treatment of 
mild to moderate pneumonia due to COVID -19, with the goal to assess suppression of the virus, 
improvement of symptoms and prevention of disease progression.

1.2.3. Clinical data  
Antroquinonol is currently being investigated for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), under investigational new drug (IND) [ADDRESS_153949].  
Phase 1 study (Study GOLANTA20090911) 
A first -in-human Phase 1  study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dos e and to 
evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability, and efficacy profiles of antroquinonol in 
NSCLC patients who are refractory to conventional treatment modalities. This open- label, 
nonrandomized, dose-escalation study enrolled a total of 13 patients, all of whom were Asian. A total of 5 patients were enrolled in an accelerated titration phase (1 patient each in the 50 -, 100-, 
200-, 300-, and 450-mg dose groups), and [ADDRESS_153950] titration phase (3 patients in the 450-mg dose group and 5 patients in the 600-mg dose group). No dose- limiting 
toxicities were reported in any patient for any of the doses in the intention- to-treat (ITT) 
population. Safety results indicated that antroquinonol doses up to 600 mg were generall y safe 
and well tolerated when given daily for 4 weeks. 
Under single dose conditions, the maximum antroquinonol concentration was generally observed 
between 1.00 and 3.70 hours, with the exception of the 200- mg dose group where a median  time 
 
 
 
09 July 2021 Page 18 of 75 CONFIDENTIAL  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
to maximum pla sma concentration  (tmax) of 10.00 hours was observed. Under multiple dose 
conditions, the results were similar, with the median t max ranging from 1.92 to 4.05 hours. 
Antroquinonol was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_135600]- life (time between maximum plasma concentration [ Cmax] to 
half-maximum concentration C 1/2 [T1/2]) ranging from 1.30 to 4.33 hours, independent of the 
treatment dose. The rate and extent of absorption of antroquinonol increased in a dose-proportional manner over the dosing range of 50 to 600 mg after multiple administrations of antroquinonol. However, under single- dose conditions, the rate and extent of antroquinonol 
absorption increased in a nondose proportional and a dose-propo rtional manner, respectively, 
over the dosing range of 50 to 600 mg. No clear trend was observed when comparing the PK parameters under single dose conditions to those under multiple dose conditions. 
Phase 2  study (GHNSCLC -2-001) in NSCLC 
A single -arm, open- label, Phase 2  study was conducted to determine the efficacy, safety, and PK 
of antroquinonol in patients with stage IV (including pleural effusion) NSCLC who had failed 
2 lines of anticancer therapy. Thirty-one patients with NSCLC received antroquinonol at 200 mg 3 times daily ( TID) (at 8 -hour intervals) for 12 weeks with option for extension. A total of 
15 patients were Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-positive and [ADDRESS_153951] 12 -week treatment cycle,  5 patients who were progression  
free received further (12 -week) treatment cycles with 200 mg TID antroquinonol (extension 
phase).  
Of the 52 patients screened, 31 patients were enrolled and treated during the Treatment Phase. Overall, 30 (96.8%) patients experienced 268 treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ); 
28 (90.3%) patients experienced 111 treatment -related TEAEs; 12 (38.7%) patients experienced 
at least one serious adverse event ( SAE ). 
Average concentrations of antroquinonol in plasma with 200 mg TID antroquinonol treatment were uniformly higher on Day 28 than on Day 1. The mean C
max was 276.87 and 393.55 ng/mL 
for Days 1 and 28, respectively, and the mean area under the plasma concentration  versus time 
curve (AUC) within a  dosing interval ( AUC tau) was 790.9 and 1224.3 h*ng/mL. The average oral 
clearance for antroquinonol was higher on Day 1 (254.31 L/h) than on Day 28 (197.82 L/h). The mean values of T
1/2 on Day 1 and T 1/2,eff on Day 28 were 1.617 and 7.643 h, respectively. The 
mean antroquinonol t rough plasma concentration ( Ctrough) were 44.99 and 74.71 ng/mL on Days 
1 and 28, respectively. Accumulation of antroquinonol following 28 days of 200 mg TID  dosing 
was estimated to be 1.892-fold. 
Phase 2  study (GHLIP -2-001) Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]  
A total of 180 subjects were screened and 120 of them were eligible. Of the 120 enrolled 
subjects, 30 each were randomly assigned to the placebo, antroquinonol 50 mg, antroquinonol 100 mg, and antroquinonol 150 mg groups. One hundred subjects completed the 12- week study 
treatment period. The main reason of discontinuation was the occurrence of adverse events ( AEs) 
(15 out of 20, 75.0%).

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
Antroquinonol was generally well tolerated when administered at 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg 
once daily for 12 weeks. During the study, 55.6% in the antroquinonol group and 46.7% in the 
placebo group reported at least [ADDRESS_153952] common AE occurring in the antroquinonol group and placebo group by [CONTACT_9313] ( SOC ) were gastrointestinal disorders, in which, diarrhoea was the most frequent AE 
reported in both antroquinonol and placebo groups. The AEs most frequently associated with antroquinonol treatment by [CONTACT_73972] (PTs ) were diarrhoea (32.2%), nausea (6.7%), and 
vomiting (4.4%). There was an increasing trend in the incidence of diarrhoea as the dose of antroquinonol increased. 
Two SAEs were reported in one subject receiving antroquinonol. The SAEs were not related to 
antroquinonol and did not cause study discontinuation. 
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital signs, physical examination, electrocardiogram  (ECG ), and laboratory assessments. 
Overall, the results of this  study showed a positive benefit-risk pr ofile in favor of antroquinonol 
100 mg in terms of lipid profile and arterial stiffness. The dosages of antroquinonol were generally well tolerated.  
1.3. Benefit -risk Assessment  
There remains a significant unmet medical need for treatment options for patients with mild to moderate pneumonia due to COVID -19. Antroquinonol has been observed as a drug with a 
relatively low -toxicity profile in preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies and clinical 
studies. To date, no fatal or severe/serious ADR s have occurred  in the clinical studies of 
antroquinonol. Based on previous studies, antroquinonol has no hepatotoxicity and no cardiac toxicities. Safety of antroquinonol has not been assessed in a patient population hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135601] C OVID -19. More detailed information about the known and 
expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of antroquinonol in other patient populations may be found in the current IB.
5 
The results of PK studies, including absolute bioavailability determination, organ distribution, metabolism related to cytochrome P450 isoform  (CYP450), main metabolites in rat urine, and 
cross-species metabolite comparisons indicated fast absorption, substantial organ distribution 
(especially in lung, heart, and kidney), and CYP450-involved metabolism profiles of antroquinonol. 
No other proven therapeutic options exist for the patient population hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135602] -19. If proved effective, use of antroquinonol in mild to 
moderate pneumonia due to COVID -19 would fulfil an urgent unmet medical need in the context 
of a global pandemic and a novel coronavirus. 
As the design of this study is considered conservative and acceptable, and the study subjects 
targeted are patients with limited treatment options, the overall benefit/risk assessment supports further investigation of antroquinonol in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135603] -19 in a P hase 2 setting.

3. INVESTIGATION PLAN 
3.1. Overall s tudy design and plan d escription  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2, proof of concept study in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135603]-19. As antroquinonol has shown antiviral and anti- inflammatory activity in preclinical studies, it is being planned to use 
for treatment in patients with COVID -19 infection. 
Approximately 15 to 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002] , and other countries based on the pandemic 
situation,  are planned to enroll patients. 
The main characteristics of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135604]: adult patients with onset of COVID -19 symptoms within 2 weeks  prior to randomization.  
The planned treatment duration is 14 days of administration of antroquinonol or placebo in combination with SoC therapy per local SoC policies. The total stud y duration is planned to be a 
maximum of 3 3 days  (screening period up to 3 days, planned study treatment duration up to 
14 days, follow -up/End of Study (EOS) assessments up to 28±2 days  after start of treatment ). 
A total of 174 patients are planned to be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_153955] of a sentinel cohort of 20 patients (10  patients randomized to 
antroquinonol and 10 patients to placebo), and an expansion cohort of 154 patients (77 patients 
in each treatment g roup). Enrollment will pause after the 20
th patient in the sentinel cohort has 
started treatment, until the results of the interim analysis are known. Once the 20th patient in the 
sentinel cohort has completed 14 days of treatment, an unblinded Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will assess the safety, tolerability , efficacy, and PK of 100 mg twice daily ( BID) 
antroquinonol in COVID-19 patients in the sentinel cohort (interim analysis 1) . The DMC will 
issue a recommendation to enroll patients for the expansion cohort, or to stop the study depending on the safety and futility assessment. Once the 80
th patient has been enrolled and 
completed 14 days of treatment, the DMC will review safety , tolerability, and, efficacy data 
(interim analysis  2). Enrollment may be restricted at the 100th patient until the DMC has 
completed the assessment to prevent excessive enrol lment. The DMC will continue to review 
safety and assess the risk/benefit profile on an ongoing basis. 
Patients will undergo assessment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135605] 2 if judged to be ready for discharge. If discharged, patients 
will then be requested to take study treatment at home (as prescribed) up to Day 14. End of Treatment (EOT) assessments will be performed  at Day 14  (+2 days) (at home or site visit) . A 
Day 5 (+/ -1 day)  visit (at home or site  visit) will be performed if the patient is discharged prior to 
Day 5. If the patient is discharged after completion of treatment and before the follow up visit, 
he/she will be followed up on Day 28 (±2 days) for study assessments (a telephone or telemedicine visit) . Post discharge, assessments will be done by [CONTACT_135681], 
except  for Day 5, Day 14, and Early Termination  (ET)  of Study Treatment.  If the discharge, ET, 
or Early Withdrawal visi t falls within the window of a schedule Day visit, the assessments for 
the visits can be combined as one visit. The study design is summarized in  Figure  1.

b Patients could be discharged after start of treatment any time after Day  2 if judged to be ready for discharge. If discharged, 
patients will then be requested to take study treatment at home (as prescribed) up to Day  14. End of Treatment assessments at 
Day 14 (+2 days) (at home or site visit) will be pe rformed. A Day  5 (+/-1 day) visit (at home or site  visit) will be performed if the 
patient is discharged prior to Day  5. If the patient is discharged after completion of treatment and before follow up visit, he/she 
will be followed up on Day  28 (±2 days) f or study assessments (a tele phone or telemedicine visit). Post discharge, assessments 
will be done by [CONTACT_756], except for Day  5, Day  14, and Early Termination  of Study Treatment . If the discharge, E arly 
Termination , or Early Withdrawal visit falls within the window of a  schedule Day visit, the assessments for the visits can be 
combined as one visit.  
3.2. Discussion of s tudy design, i ncluding the c hoice of control groups  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2, proof of concept st udy in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135603]-19 infection. The 
rationale for this study is outlined in Section  1.1 and described in detail below. 
The study is designed to obtain initial safety, efficacy, tolerability, and PK of antroquinonol in patients in a sentinel cohort. Once the DMC assesses safety, efficacy, tolerability, and PK of a sentinel cohort, patient enrollment will resume. The study will assess the efficacy and safety in all of the patients (174 patients).  
Antroquinonol has been studied for NSCLC and pancreatic cancer. Pre clinical studies showed 
that antroquinonol appeared to distribute to the lungs more than any other organ, followed by [CONTACT_135682],  kidneys, and small intestine ( Section  5.2.3 of the IB
5). Hence, the sponsor has planned use 
to assess the safety an d efficacy of antroquinonol in the COVID -19 patient population.

LabCorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_153956] the reliability of any conclusions based on uncontrolled data. Therefore, per the FDA’s recommendation, this is a randomized, placebo -controlled study. 
There are safety concerns in this patient population, both because of risks associated with the disease and because of the potential for adverse effects from the treatment that might be difficult to recognize.   
In addition, altering the immune response during an acute infection could theoretically have either beneficial or harmful consequences that cannot be precisely predicted. For this reason, the DMC will review safety data in [ADDRESS_153957] study drug 
dose of the day on Day 3 and Day 14 (if patients are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) , in the sentinel cohort. 
Although PK has been well characterized in earlier studies, this is an acute patient population 
which may experience third -spacing and may be hemodynamically unstab le. For this reason, 
intensive serial  plasma PK samples (7 -8 samples per patient)  are being collected on Day  [ADDRESS_153958] included oral single doses of 50-600 mg and 200 mg BID (BID use has 
occurred due to a short plasma half-life of 1.30 to 4.33 hours). For the proposed clinical work, a 
starting dose of 100mg (given BID due to short half-life) is proposed based around anti-inflammatory activity in mouse effic acy work and the rat no-observed-adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL ) from toxicology testing. In the former, a 15-50 mg/kg/12.3 body surface factor was 
calculated to correspond to a 1.22-4.07 mg/kg human equivalent dose, or 85-285 mg for a 70 kg person. Therefore, a dose of 100 mg BID is within the animal efficacy range. The proposed dose is also supported by [CONTACT_135683] a mg/m² basis with an approximate 2- fold safety

margin [NOAEL in rat (30 mg/kg) x 6 (to convert dose in mg/kg to dose in mg/m²) = 180 mg/m² 
vs human 200 mg daily dose = 2.9 mg/kg x 37 (dose in mg/kg to dose in mg/m²) which converts to 108 mg/m² for a 70 kg person]. 
The safety of antroquinonol in patients with mild to moderate pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_4113]-19 
will be  confirmed at 100 mg BID i n the sentinel and expansion cohorts, which is within the 
animal efficacy range. 
Treatment duration was selected based on the clinical presentation  of the disease. Patients with 
COVID -19 experience systemic symptoms for approximately 7  to 10 days, and patients with 
disease progression but without ventilator use are typi[INVESTIGATOR_135606] 5 to  7 days. In a 
subset of patients, a cytokine storm can emerge resulting in complications. A treatment duration 
of 14 days should be adequate to treat the infection and prevent the immune response complications.

 Renal i mpairment  
If a p atient has renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50  mL/min), treatment should be 
discontinued. 
4.4.3. Disco ntinuation of s tudy t reatment  
A patient  may be discontinued early from study drug treatment (ET of study treatment) for the 
following reasons: 
• Lack of efficacy (e.g. patients who require nonstudy antiviral or anticytokine therapy due 
to progression of COVID-19), and the investigator’s decision. Note: remdesivir or other authorized treatments for COVID-19 is allowed if considered SoC, if started prior to randomization or during the study. Initiation of remdesivir or other authorized treatments 
for COVID -19 during the study will be considered a tr eatment failure  if started due to 
progression of disease. 
• Adverse event  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676]  (specify reason in the eCRF)  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Death

LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
• Physician decision (i.e. investigator decision based on protocol deviation, assessment that 
it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue, or other reason [specify reason in the eCRF]).  
• Sponsor decision (specify reason in the electronic case report form [ eCRF ]) 
No temporary treatment discontinuation is permitted.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment pr ematurely will be asked about the reason(s) for 
discontinuation and will be asked to continue all assessments up to Day 28. Patients will be educated about the continued scientific importance of their data and encouraged to complete the Day 28 Follow-up/EO S assessments even if they discontinue study treatment prematurely.  
4.4.4. Study withdrawal  
A patient  may be discontinued early from the study for the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676]  (specify reason in the eCRF)  
• Lost to follow-up 
• Death  
• Physician decision  (i.e. investigator decision based on protocol deviation, assessment that 
it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue, or other reason [specify reason in the eCRF]).  
• Sponsor decision (specify reason in the eCRF) 
If the patient  withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. Additionally, patients  
may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 5 ) for data to be 
collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. Patients will be asked to complete Follow-up/ EOS evaluat ions. 
4.4.5. Lost to Follow- up 
A patient  will be considered lost to follow-up if he/ she repeatedly is unable to be contact[CONTACT_135686][INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
The following actions must be taken if a patient repeatedly is unable to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] : 
• The sit e must attempt to contact [CONTACT_135687], counsel the patient  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, 
and ascertain whether or not the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in the st udy.

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
• In cases in which the patient  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970]  (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s  last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s  
medical record.  
• Should the patient  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
4.4.6. Replacement p rocedures  
Patients who discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 
4.4.7. Follow- up of patient s who withdraw from the s tudy  
Due to the continued scientific importance of patient data even if study treatment is discon tinued 
early, p atients who withdraw  from the study will be asked to complete final study procedures 
(Follow-up/ EOS  visit), as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 5). Patients who 
are no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135610]. 
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of discontinuation, or that develop prior to the final 
Follow-up/EOS visit, will be followed until resolution or stabilization, or up to [ADDRESS_153967] dose of study treatment, by  [CONTACT_135688] ( PSS) group 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
Steps will be taken by [CONTACT_135689] ( eg, with a vital 
records search)  up to Day [ADDRESS_153968] of a sentinel cohort of 20 patients (10 patients randomized to antroquinonol and 10 patients to placebo), and an expansion cohort of 154 patients (77 patients in each treatment group). Enrollment will pause after the 20
th patient in the sentinel cohort has 
started treatment. Once the 20th patient in the sentinel cohort has completed 14 days of treatment, 
the unblinded DMC will assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and PK of study medication (interim analysis  1). The DMC will issue a recommendation to enroll patients for the expansion 
cohort, or to stop the study depending on the safety and futility assessment.  
Once the 80
th patient has been enrolled, and completed 14 days of treatment, the DMC will 
review the safety , tolerability and efficacy data (interim analysis  2). E nrollment may be restricted 
at the 100th patient until the DMC has completed the assessment to prevent excessive enrolment. 
The DMC will continue to review safety and assess the risk/benefit profile on an ongoing basis. 
The following nonbinding rules will be considered by [CONTACT_135664], and the DMC will 
not make any recommendations to stop for early efficacy:

• Interim analysis 1 (sentinel cohort): An odds ratio of 3.5 or higher on the primary 
endpoint (proportion of patients who are alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135592] 14) in favor of placebo. 
• Interim analysis 2: An odds ratio of 1.2 or higher on the primary endpoint (proportion of patients who are alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135592]  14) in favor of placebo. 
Enrollment will pause pendi ng unscheduled DMC review of safety data when any of the 
following criteria is met: 
• ≥ 2 patients experience treatment -related SAE, or  
• ≥ 2 patients experience treatment -related severe AEs that are of a similar nature.  
Enrollment and dosing may restart following review of relevant safety data by [CONTACT_1363].  
A DMC  Charter , which includes detailed processes , will be prepared. 
4.6. Study Termination 
The sponsor reserves the right to close a study site or terminate the study ( ET of study) at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study  site closure visit has been performed. Reasons for study 
termination may include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable treatment- emergent safety 
risk to the patients  
• Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the st udy 
• Difficulties in the recruitment of patient s 
• Cancellation of drug development. 
The investigator may initiate study  site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_135690], but are not limited to:  
• Failure of the investigator  to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee or local health authorities, the sponsor's 
procedures, or Good Clinical Practice  guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093] .

6. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT T HERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_135613] O THER R ESTRICTIONS  
6.1. Permitted medications  
Any medication or vaccine (including over- the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the patient  is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded in  the eCRF along with: 
• reason for use  
• dates of administration including start and end dates, and 
• dosage information including dose and frequency. 
Patients must be instructed not to take any medications, including over-the-counter products, 
without first consulting with the investigator . The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_135697]. 
Medicat ions, other than that those listed as prohibited medications and other restrictions, which 
are considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well -being, may be given at the discretion of 
the investigator  and must be recorded in the appropriate sections  of the eCRF.  
6.2. Prohibited medications  
Simultaneous participation in other clinical treatment study protocols is not allowed.  
Treatment with any antiviral drugs (except remdesivir  or other authorized treatments for 
COVID -19), or with any drugs known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C19, 3A4, 
2C8, and 2E1 are prohibited within [ADDRESS_153973] 
administration of study drug, and the use of A. camphorata-containing products other than antroquinonol is prohibited throughout the study. 
Patients who begin to receive nonstudy antiviral medication after the start of study treatment will 
be disco ntinued from study treatment.  Note: remdesivir or other authorized treatments for 
COVID -19 is allowed if considered SoC, if started prior to randomization or during the study. 
Initiation of remdesivir or other authorized treatments for COVID-19 during the study will be 
considered a treatment failure if started due to progression of disease. 
Administration of an authorized COVID- 19 vaccines is permitted as per the local health 
authority recommendation.

7. STUDY A SSESSMENTS AND P ROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 5). 
As protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed, with the exception of immediate safety concerns, deviations should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the patient should continue or discontinue the study treatment. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Assessments, is essential and required for study conduct. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential patients 
meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure (Section  4.4.1), as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the patient’s routine clinical 
management ( eg, blood count) and obtained before signing the informed consent form ( ICF) may 
be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol- specified 
criteria and was performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Appendix 5). Additionally, patients will receive instructions for home administration of study treatment and a diary to capture all doses  after a discharge.  
Results of the confirmatory COVID -[ADDRESS_153975] is not 
document ed as SoC . 
At screening, laboratory tests an d ECGs will be performed locally, as applicable, to assess 
eligibility and do not need to be repeated if already done as SoC ( eg, within 24 to 48 hours of 
screening and patient is clinically stable). Chest x-ray or CT scan will be performed, as applicable,  to assess eligibility and does not need to be repeated if done within [ADDRESS_153976] samples can be taken after confirming eligibility. Baseline laboratory samples can be obtained at screening or on Da y 1 (predose). 
Postbaseline laboratory samp les do not need to be taken predose.  
7.1. Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy assessment will be based on the clinical status of the patient during the study.  
7.1.1. Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is  related to  the proportion of patients alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518] (ie,  no need for invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, high- flow 
oxygen, or ECMO) on Day 14. 
7.1.2. Secondary efficacy endpoints  
 Clinical improvement  
The WHO COVID -19 Clinical Improvement Ordinal Scale  will be used to assess a clinical 
improvement score on Days 7, 14, and 28. See  Appendix 7 for details on the scale.

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_153977] already done as SoC can be used to determine 
eligibility. All subsequent tests (Da y 1 and later) will be performed by a central laboratory. The 
PCR testing for SARS -CoV -2 will be collected during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135615] ( Appendix 5) and evaluated by [CONTACT_2237] . 
Virological clearance will be measured by:  
• Time to viral clearance:  This endpoint will measure the time (days) to the first negative 
test for COVID -19. 
• Rate of change in viral load:  if quantitative PCR results are performed, the level of 
virus will be measured over t ime (days).  
 Vital status  
Patient mortality will be recorded  up to Day  28 and summarized in the analysis  on Days 7, 14, 
and 28. Every effort will be made to ascertain vital status in all randomized patients ( eg, with a 
vital records search ) up to Day 28. 
 Duration of ICU stay 
Duration of ICU stay is defined as the total number of days the patient is managed in the ICU during their participation in the study, up to Day  28. The date of the start and stop of the ICU 
stay must be recorded in the eCRF; no daily as sessment is needed.  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_135616] [ADDRESS_153978] be recorded in the eCRF; no daily assessment is needed.  
 COVID- 19 symptoms  
COVID -19 symptoms a ssessment at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in 
Appendix 5 will evaluate: presence or absence of dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath/

difficulty in breathing), or chills/rigors, myalgia (muscle  pain), headache, sore throat, and loss of 
taste or smell; other symptoms that could be related to COVID -19 will also be recorded. 
7.1.3. Exploratory efficacy endpoints  
The exploratory efficacy endpoints include: 
•Covariates of age, sex, and remdesivir or other au thorized treatments for COVID -19 use at baseline
•Use of any new authorized treatments recommended as SoC for COVID -[ADDRESS_153979] hoc and will be collected from 
the concomitant medications eCRF page.  
7.2. Safety Assessments 
7.2.1. Adverse e vents  
Definitions  
Adverse event definitions and assignment of severity and causality are deta iled in Appendix 1. 
Adverse events will be elicited from the patient (or, when appropriate, from a caregiver, surrogate, or the patient’s legally authorized representative) by [CONTACT_135698] a nonleading question such as “How are you feeling today?” or “Have you had any health concerns since your last visit?” 
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the patient to discontinue the study treatment . 
Adverse event s will be assessed from signing the ICF until [ADDRESS_153980] dose of study 
treatment (Day 28  ± 2 days) as noted in the Schedule of Assessments table ( Appendix 5). 
Adverse events will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) version 23.0 dated 19 Apr il 2020 (exclusively meant for COVID -19) or later . 
Reporting s erious adverse e vents  
Serious AE  reporting will be carried out as per local/country regulations, and will be described in 
the Safety Management Plan.  
All SAEs occurring after the signing of the ICF until [ADDRESS_153981] be reported to Covance within 
24 hours of obtaining knowledge of the event. The report should include all available information requested on the SAE form.

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
Serious AEs - Covance PSS  
 E- mail: [EMAIL_2511] (standard)  
The SAE form will collect data surrounding the event ( eg, the nature of the symptom[s], time of 
onset in relation to initiation of therapy, duration, intensity, and whether or not ther apy was 
discontinued). The investigator ’s assessment of the probable cause of the event will also be 
included. In addition, relevant medical history, concomitant medications, laboratory and 
diagnostic tests reports, and procedures as well as all pertinent medical information related to the event will also be collected.  
Covance P SS will forward SAE queries requesting incomplete or missing information directly to 
the investigator. It is the investigator’s responsibility to be diligent in providing this information back to Covance P SS as soon as it is available .  
7.2.2. Pregnancy  
Female patients of childbearing potential will take a pregnancy test during screening (or 
pretreatment on Day 1) , discharge, ET/EOT,  and at the Day 28 Follow-up/EOS visit.  
Additionally, local/country regulations will be followed as applicable (eg., a pregnancy test one month following the last dose of study treatment in female patients  of childbearing potential). 
A urine pregnancy test m ay be performed but must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test 
(screening only). The Follow-up/EOS visit test will be a urine pregnancy test only (pregnancy test kit will be provided to the patient when discharged). 
Following administration of study tre atment, pregnancy cases in any patient who is a female of 
childbearing potential or female partner of a male patient will be reported if known until the 
patient completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_135699] a completed pregnancy report to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow the patient until completion of the pregnancy and must a ssess the 
outcome in the shortest possible time . Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 
8 weeks following the estimated delivery date . 
The investigator should notify the sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE ( eg, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly 
detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_135700] a completed SAE 
form to th e sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
7.2.3. Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 5.  Clinical laboratory evaluations are 
listed in Appendix 2. Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times 
 
 
 
09 July 2021 Page 44 of 75 CONFIDENTIAL  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_153982] is to be performed in female patients of child bearing potential at a local (site) laboratory, during screening or Day 1, discharge, and ET/EOT. A u rine pregnancy test may 
be performed but must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test (screening only) . The 
Follow- up/EOS visit test will be a urine pregnancy test only  (no serum pregnancy test 
confirmation). Additionally, local/country regulations will be followed as applicable (eg., a pregnancy test one month following the last dose of study treatment in female patients of childbearing potential).  
Screening laboratory test will be assessed by a local laboratory, and baseline and postbaseline laboratory tests will be assessed by a central laboratory.  If delays in transportation of the samples 
are encountered, then local safety laboratory samples can be obtained instead for samples that can’t be frozen for shipment (e.g. hematology and urine). Baseline laboratory tests can be done once patients eligibilit y is confirmed The investigator will perform a clinical assessment of all 
clinical laboratory data.  
All screening laboratory results must be available and reviewed before the patient receives the first dose of study treatment on Day 1. After the test results are evaluated, the investigator should judge whether the patient is still eligible to stay in the study. Significant abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clin ically significant.  
In this study, clinical laboratory tests will be performed pre dose on Days 1, 5, and 14 (+2  days) . 
7.2.4. Vital signs, p hysical examination, and other safety evaluations 
 Physical examinations 
Patients will be examined at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in  Appendix 5. 
A complete physical examination including general appearance, HEENT, lymphatic, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and dermatological systems  will be performed at screening. 
 Vital signs 
Seated blood pressure, seated pulse rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697],  and body temperature will be assessed 
for safety and efficacy endpoints at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix 5. Vital signs may also be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required. 
All measurements will be performed singly and repeated once if outside the relevant clinical 
reference range. Patients must be seated for at least 5  minutes before blood pressure and pulse 
rate measurements.  Body temperature will be measured according to site ’s local practices and 
may include oral, tympanic, rectal, axillary , or frontal.

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
Pulse oximetry to measure the peripheral capi[INVESTIGATOR_19365] (SpO 2) will be collected in 
the eCRF during the study. SpO 2 measurements should be collected at Screening , Day  1, Day  3, 
Day 5, Day  7, D ay 14/EOT  or Discharge/ET , and Day  28 visits if patient i s in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (refer to  
Appendix 5). For discharged patients, SpO 2 should be collected at Day  5 and Day 14 if visits 
completed in  clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. SpO2 may be collected if the visit is conducted at home by a home 
health service professional, but is not required.  
Fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] ( FiO 2) data will be collected and partial pressure of oxygen ( PaO 2) 
will also be collected if  done as standard of care as per  Appendix 5.  
12-lead Electrocardiogram Parameters  
Single 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the patient has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_34884] 
[ADDRESS_153983], and AUC tau. 
Blood samples for PK evaluations  will be on Day 3 at pre dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours 
postdose (after the first study drug dose of the day), for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48256]. For 
discharged patients/ outpatient visits, the 12-hour sample can be omitted for scheduling purposes. 
On Day  14 if patients are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], predose and 2 hours postdose samples (after the first 
study drug dose of the day) will also be collected.  
Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965]  2 prior to PK sampling will not need to 
return to the clinic for sample collection.  
The PK samples will not be collected for the expansion cohort.

8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSES  
8.1. Determination of sample size 
The decision to include 20 patients in the sentinel cohort was chosen arbitrarily.  
The sample size for the expansion group has been determined to provide evidence of proof of 
concept efficacy should the treatment prove effective.  The primary endpoint and futility rules are 
based on assessments at Day  14 to enable rapid decision making, and the assessment  at Day  28 
will also be presented  as a secondary endpoint. 
The detailed assumptions are as follows, and the calculations include the patients from the sentinel cohort that were treated with the same dose used for the expansion cohort: 
Alpha  0.2 (one -sided)  
Power  80% 
Drop -Outs assumed  2% 
Endpoint  Odds of patient alive and respi[INVESTIGATOR_135617]  [ADDRESS_153984] Size  78% Placebo  
89% Antroquinonol  
Futility boundary shape  Manually chosen.  
Odds Ratio of 3.5 at interim analysis 1 in favor of placebo, 
and 1.2 at i nterim analysis 2 in favor of placebo.  
Equivalent to 4 patients not in respi[INVESTIGATOR_135618] 7 on placebo at i nterim analysis 1, or 
26 patients not in respi[INVESTIGATOR_135619] 
28 on placebo at i nterim analysis 2. 
Nonbinding  
Efficacy boundary shape  None  
 
In addition, the performance of the study under the following scenarios for the efficacy of 
antroquinonol were also considered: 
Antroquinonol harmful  78% Placebo  
67% Antroquinonol  
Antroquinonol no effect  78% Placebo  
78% Antroquinonol  
 
The nonbinding decision rules of the i nterim analysis and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_135620]: 
   Cumulative Futility  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_135621] #  Sample  
Size Futility 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_135622] 1 20 3.5 25% 17% 5%

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
The decision rules may be modified pending discussion with the DMC, but any modifications 
will still be considered non binding; therefore , no adjustment for the final alpha will be made. 
The estimates of the probabilities of response are supported by [CONTACT_135701]  19, which reported 21% mortality of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], and 320 patients 
requiring ventilation. The authors reported 88.1% mortality for patients requiring ventilation, implying that 282 patients died after receiving ventilation. Since 553 patients died overall, this means that 271 patients died without receiving mechanical ventilation, and therefore 320+271 = 591 patients either died or received mechanical ventilation. This leads to the conclusion that 591/2634 (22.4%) patients, either died or received mechanical ventilation at some point.  
It is anticipated that at least 50% of patients will need to benefit from antroquinonol to be 
considered a clinical breakthrough, hence an improvement from 22% to 11% is considered appropriate for the alternative hypothesis.  
8.2. Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations will be included for this study: 
Intention- to-treat (ITT):  All randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed according to the 
treatment to which they were randomized. modified ITT  (mITT) : All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
 
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  All patients from the ITT set who have no important protocol deviations 
during the study. Patients with any important protocol deviations shall be excluded from the PPS 
prior to database lock. 
Safety Set (S S): All patients who have received at least 1 dose of the study treatment . Patients 
will be analyzed according to the study treatment they actually received.  
Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS):  Patients in the sentinel cohort who have received at least [ADDRESS_153985] descriptive statistics: number of patients (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Frequency of patients or events and percentages will be summarized in categorical variables.  
Missing values on clinical improvement score will be imputed using Last Observation Carried Forward for a maximum of 1  day at Day  7, 2 days at Day  14, and 4 days at Day  28. For

LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_135623], where a patient has died, their status will not be considered missing but 
will be treated as an observation at each timepoint. 
Unless otherwise stated, all regression models will be adjusted for age and remdesivir or other 
authorized treatments for COVID-19 use at baseline. 
Results will be considered statistically significant at one -sided alpha of 0.025, and considered to 
indicate promising trend at one-sided alpha of 0.2. 
Additional information is available in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
8.4. Efficacy Analysis 
The efficacy analysis will be based on the final SAP.  
8.4.1. Primary e fficacy outcome measures 
The proportion of patients from each treatment group who are alive and free of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135624] [ADDRESS_153986]. The primary model will be stratified by [CONTACT_135669] -19 use at baseline and by [CONTACT_23276] (> 65 years vs ≤  65 years ). 
8.4.2. Secondary e fficacy outcome measures  
Clinical improvement measured as a score on the WHO COVID -[ADDRESS_153987] ratio and its 95% confidence interval for time to event outcomes will be estimated by [CONTACT_135702], with patients censored at the time they are provided any antiviral therapy  not prescribed at baseline, or on Day [ADDRESS_153988] not yet recovered. Patients who die 
at any time will be considered not yet recovered by [CONTACT_2006] 28. Median time to 2-point improvement, time to score of 2 or lower, and time to score of 0 will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier (KM) method, and the KM curve will be provided. The p-value for comparison 
between groups will be obtained based on proportional hazards modeling stratified by [CONTACT_135671].  
Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135593] [ADDRESS_153989], will be evaluated using similar statistical methods as clinical

LabCorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_153990] on efficacy of any new authorized treatments recommended as SoC for COVID -19 
during the course of the study will also be evaluated.  
8.5. Safety Analysis 
Safety variables include incidence of AEs  (or TEAEs) , laboratory test results, vital signs, and 
complete  physical examination, ECG,  and chest imaging (x‑ray or CT scan) findings . All safety 
analyses will be based on the SS. No formal statistical analysis of the safety data will be 
performed.  
Adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA, version 23.0 dated 19 Apr il 2020 
(exclusively meant for COVID -19) or later. 
The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs related to study treatment, SAEs related to study treatment, TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, TEAEs leading to study discontinuation, and TEAEs leading to death will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and treatment group. In addition, the severity of TEAEs and relationship to study treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], PT, and treatment group. 
The AE summary tables will include c ounts of patients. Therefore, if a patient experiences more 
than 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a particular AE, the patient will be counted only once for that event. If a patient 
has more than one AE that is coded to the same PT , the patient will be counted only once for t hat

Pregnancy test results and patient s with confirmed positive pregnancy test result will be listed.  
8.6. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for antroquinonol plasma concentrations at prespecified timepoints and derived PK parameters  (listed in Section  7.3). 
8.7. Interim Analysis  
The following interim analyses will be conducted: 
• Interim analysis 1, for safety and futility , will be conducted when the sentinel cohort has 
completed at least 14 days of treatment. Enroll ment will be paused once the 20
th patient 
in the sentinel cohort has been enrolled and started treatment until the results of the 
interim analysis are known. 
• Interim analysis 2, for safety and futility, will be conducted on all data collected up to the 80
th randomized patient completing 14  days of treatment. Enrollment may be restricted at 
the 100th patient until the DMC has completed the assessment to prevent excessive 
enrollment.  
All interim analyses will be reviewed by [CONTACT_135704]. The DMC will not make recomm endations to stop the study early for efficacy. Futility rules provided to the DMC will be 
nonbinding, and therefore no adjustment of the final analysis will be made. Should either ≥  2 
patients experience treatment related SAEs or severe AEs that are of a similar nature at any time, enroll ment will be paused while the DMC reviews safety data.  
A DMC Charter , which includes detailed processes, will be prepared .

Appendix 1.  Adverse E vent D efinitio ns 
Definitions  
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. This includes the following: 
• Any clinically significant worsening of a pre -existing condition.  
• Any recurrence of a pre- existing condition.  
• An AE occurring from overdose of a s ponsor study drug  whether accidental or intentional ( ie, a dose higher 
than that prescribed by a health care professional for clinical reasons).  
• An AE occurring from abuse of a s ponsor study drug ( ie, use for nonclinical reasons).  
• An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a s ponsor study drug.  
• Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (i.e. the lab oratory  abnormality is associated with symptoms , 
requires medical intervention , or requires changes to study drug treatment).  
Note: A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE. 
A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition (including a condition being treated) that is 
diagn osed before the patient signs the informed consent f orm and that is documented as part of 
the patient’s medical history.  
The questions concerning whether the condition existed before the start of the active phase of the 
study and whether it has increased i n severity and/or frequency will be used to determine 
whether an event is a treatment -emergent AE. An AE is considered to be treatment -emergent if 
(1) it is not present when the active phase of the study begins and is not a chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, or (2) it is present at the start of the active phase of the study or as part of the patient’s medical history, but the severity or frequency increases during the active phase. The active phase of the study begins at the ti me of the first dose of the study 
drug. The active phase of the study ends at the Day 28 Follow-up/End of Study ( EOS ) visit.  
Disease- specific signs and symptoms that were ongoing prior to study entry will not be 
considered AEs unless they worsen ( eg, increase in frequency or severity) unexpectedly during 
the course of the trial.  
Reporting of Adverse Events  
At each visit the investigator, or delegate, will determine whether or not any AEs have occurred. Nonleading questions such as “How are you feeling today?” or “Have you had any health 
concerns since your last visit?” should be used to elicit the patient to report any possible AEs. If any AEs have occurred, they will be recorded in the AE section of the electronic c ase report f orm 
(eCRF ) and in the patient’s source documents. If known, the diagnosis should be recorded, in 
preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. 
Adverse event reporting begins from the time of informed consent and ends [ADDRESS_153995] 
dose of study treatment (Day 28  ± 2 days).

Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using the 
following categories:  
• Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does 
not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
• Moderate: Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with 
usual activities of daily living, causi ng discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
patient.  
• Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, significant ly affects clinical status, or may require 
intensive therapeutic intervention. 
Relationship to Study Treatment  
The investigator will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the study drug using a 4-category system according to the following guidelines: 
• Not related : When the AE is definitely caused by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical state, or the study 
procedur e/conditions.  
• Unlikely Related: When the temporal association between the AE and the drug is such that the drug is not 
likely to have any reasonable association with the AE.  
• Possibly Related : When the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical state or the study 
procedures/conditions.  
• Related : When the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug, abates upon 
discontinuation of the drug, and follows a known or hypothesized cause -effect relationship.  
• If causality is assessed as Related or Possibly Related, the event will be considered as related for regulatory 
reporting purposes.  
Action Taken for Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee will record the action taken for the AE in the eCRF. Actions taken will include: 
• Dose not changed : The medication schedule was not changed.  
• Drug withdrawn: The medication schedule was modified through termination of the prescribed regimen of 
medication.  
• Not applicable  
• Unknown . 
Follow- up of Adverse Events  
All (S)AEs that are ongoing at the time of discontinuation, or that develop prior to the final Follow-up/EOS visit, will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_153996] dose of study treatment , or until resolution or stabilization.  
Adverse Drug Reactions  
 
 
 
09 July 2021 Page 56 of 75 CONFIDENTIAL  CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: [ADDRESS_153997] (IMP; ie, where a 
causal relationship between an IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility) related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs) . 
For marketed medicinal products, a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of diseases or for modification of physiological function, is to be considered an ADR . 
An unexpected ADR  is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (eg, investigator’s brochure for an unapproved IMP).  
Serious Adv erse Events  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that meets 1 or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (see below ) 
• Requires patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see  below ) 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity (see  below ) 
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
A life -threatening adverse event  is any AE that places the patient at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred. A life-threatening event does not include an event that might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually occurred. For example, drug -induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence 
of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening, even though drug-induced hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135625] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a criterion for considering an AE to be 
seriou s. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135626]. In the absence of an 
AE, the participating investigator  should not report hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135627]. This is the case in the following situations:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by [CONTACT_760]  
(excluding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135628]) . Day or night survey visits for biopsy or surgery 
required by [CONTACT_135707].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure followed by [CONTACT_5243] 
(eg, stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in the study file.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135629].

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112044] a pre- existing condition that 
has not worsened does not constitute an SAE ( eg, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a total knee 
replacement due to a pre-existing condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened 
during the study).  
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions (ie, the AE  resulted in a significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, 
damage, or disruption in the patient’s bodily function/structure, physical activities, or quality of 
life).  
If there is any doubt as to whether a case constitutes an AE or SAE based on the information available, the case should be treated as an SAE.  
Pregnancy  
The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of a patient’s pregnancy. The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male patient’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in this study . After obtaining the 
necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the part ner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be 
followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor (or designee). 
Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 we eks following the estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post study pregnancy -related 
SAE considered reasonably related to the IMP  by [CONTACT_135708]. 
While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
Events not to be reported as adverse even ts  
A lack of drug effect is not an AE in this study because the purpose of the clinical study is to 
establish treatment effect.  
The following study- specific clinical events related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID -19) 
are exempt from AE reporting unless the investigator judges the event to be related to study 
drug:

Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines 
• Applicable International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Cl inical Practice ( GCP ) Guidelines  
• Applicable local/country laws and regulations  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, i nformed consent form ( ICF), investigator’s brochure, and other 
relevant documents ( eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/ Ethics 
Committee ( EC) by [CONTACT_135709]/ EC before the study is initiated.  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB/ EC approval before implementation of changes made to 
the study design, exce pt for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator  will be responsible for the following:  
• Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/ EC annually or more frequently in 
accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201]/EC  
• Notifying the IRB/ EC of serious adverse events  or other significant safety findings as required by [CONTACT_1744]/EC 
procedures  
• Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence  to requirements of 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations ( CFR) , ICH guidelines, the IRB/ EC, European regulation 536/2014 for clinical studies 
(if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations. 
Finances and Insurance  
Financing and insurance will be addressed in a separate agreement.  
Informed Consent  
Prior to starting participation in the study, each patient will be provided with a study- specific ICF 
giving details of the study drugs, procedures, and potential risks of the study. Patients  will be 
instructed that they are free to obtain further information from the investigator (or designee) and 
that their participation is voluntary and they are free to withdraw from the study at any time.  
Patients will be given an opportunity to ask questions about the study prior to providing consent for participation.  
Patients  or their legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of informed 
consent that meets the requirements of local regulations, ICH guidelines, and the IRB/ EC or 
study center, where applicable. If using a legally authorized representative, informed consent 
should be obtained from the patient once he/she has regained the cognitive ability to understand 
the study. The patient or their legally authorized represent ative will be given a copy of the signed 
ICF, and the original will be maintained with the patient’s records.  
Patients  must be reconsented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation 
in the study.

Patient  Data Protection  
Patients  will be assigned a unique identifier and will not be identified by [CONTACT_135710] f orms ( eCRFs ), study-related forms, study reports, or any related publications. Patient  and 
investigator  personal data will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
In the event the study protocol, study report, or study data are included in a public registry, all 
identifiable information from individual patients  or investigator s will be redacted according to 
applicable laws and regulations. 
The patient  must be informed that his/her personal study- related data will be used by [CONTACT_135711]. The level of disclosure must also be explained to 
the patient . The patient  must also be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by 
[CONTACT_135712] ( CRO ) auditors or other authorized personnel 
appointed by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor, by [CONTACT_6667]/ EC members, and by [CONTACT_9326].  
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
The unblinded DMC will assess the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of 
study medication. The DMC will assess data in the sentinel cohort (interim analysis  1) and will 
issue a recommendation to enroll patients for the expansion cohort, or to stop the study 
depending on the safety assessment. Once the 80th patient has been enrolled, and completed 
14 days of treatment, the DMC will review the safety, tolerability  and efficacy data (interim 
analysis  2). Enrollment may be restricted at the 100th patient until the DMC has completed the 
assessment to prevent excessive enrolment. The DMC will continue to review safety and assess the risk/benefit profile on an ongoing b asis. 
The DMC members (independent of the sponsor) will be selected on the basis of relevant experience and understanding of clinical research and the issues specific to the therapeutic area, as well as previous DMC experience.  
A DMC charter, which include s detailed processes, will be prepared.  
Disclosure 
All information provided regarding the study, as well as all information collected and/or 
documented during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential. The investigator  (or 
designee) agrees not to disclose such information in any way without prior written permission 
from the sponsor. 
Data Quality Assurance 
The following data quality steps will be implemented: 
• All patient data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless directly transmitted to the s ponsor or 
designee electronically (eg,  laboratory data). The investigator  is responsible for verifying that data entries 
are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_42507].

• The investigator  must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered 
in the eCRF.  
• The investigator  must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/ EC review, and regulatory agency 
inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of 
the data. Pre defined, agreed risks, monitoring thresholds, quality tolerance thresholds, controls, and 
mitigation plans will be documented  in a risk management register. Additional details of quality checking 
to be performed on the data may be included in a Data Management Plan.  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by 
[CONTACT_135713], complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and 
rights of patients  are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently 
approved protocol and any other study agreem ents, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by 
[CONTACT_135714] 21 CFR 312.62(c) unless local regulations or institutional policies 
require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written 
notification to the s ponsor.  
Investigator Documentation Responsibilities 
All individual, patient -specific study data will be entered into a 21 CFR Part  11-compliant 
electronic data capture (EDC) system on an eCRF in a timely fashion. All data generated from 
external sources ( eg, central laboratory, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, 
electrocardiogram  central readers) and transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically will 
be integrated with the patient’s  eCRF data in accordance with the Data Management Plan.  
An eCRF must be completed for each patient  who signs an ICF and undergoes any pre screening 
or screening procedures, according to the eCRF completion instructions. The sponsor, or CRO, will review the supporting source documentation against the data entered into the eCRFs to verify the accuracy of the electronic data. The investigator  will ensure that corrections are made 
to the eCRFs and that data queries are resolved in a timely fashion by [CONTACT_5984].  
The investigator will sign and date the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature [CONTACT_42540]. These signatures will indicate that the investigator reviewed and approved the data on the eCRF, the data queries, and the site notifications. 
Publications  
If on completion of the study the data warrant publication, the investigator  may publish the 
results in recognized (refereed) scientific journals subject to the provisions of the clinical study 
agreement ( CSA ). Unless otherwise specified in the CSA, the following process shall occur: 
The institution and investigator shall not publish or present data from an individual study center until the complete multicenter study has been presented in full or for [ADDRESS_153998] refer to the multicenter findings. Thereafter, if the investigator expects to participate in the publication of data generated from this site, the institution and investigator  shall submit reports, abstracts, 
manuscripts, and /or other presentation mater ials to the sponsor for review before submission for

Appendix 4.  Contraceptive Guidance 
Definitions  
Female Patients of Childbearing Potential:  Premenopausal female study patient s who are 
anatomically and physiologically capable of becoming pregnant following menarche. 
Femal e Patients of Nonchildbearing Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile:  Female  study patients  who are permanently sterile via 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and/or bilateral oophorectomy by [CONTACT_135715]/or medical records. Surgical sterilization to have occurred a 
minimum of 6 weeks, or at the investigator’s discretion, prior to screening. 
2. Postmenopausal: Female study patients  at least [ADDRESS_154000] 24  months without an alternative medical reason. 
Fertile male:  A male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male:  Permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Guidance  
Female Patients  
Female patients who are of nonchildbearing potential will not be required to use contraception. Female patients of childbearing potential must be confirmed as not being pregnant at s creening 
or pre treatment on Day  1 and be willing to use an acceptable highly-effective method of birth 
control from the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF) until [ADDRESS_154001] dose 
of study treatment. Additionally, local/country regulations will be followed as applicable (eg., monthly pregnancy test after the last dose of study treatment in female subjects of childbearing potential). Acceptable methods of contraception include: 
• hormonal injection (as prescribed) 
• combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]/progestogen-only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (as prescribed) 
• combined hormonal patch (as prescribed) 
• combined hormonal vaginal ring (as prescribed) 
• surgical method performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit: 
o bilateral tubal ligation  
o Essure
® (hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion) with confirmation of occlusion 
of the fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134] 
• hormonal implant

Protocol Reference Number : GHCovid -2-001 Protocol Version 4.0  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146  
• hormonal or nonhormonal intrauterine device 
• vasectomized male partner (sterilization performed at least 90  days prior to the screening 
visit) with verbal confirmation of surgical success, and the sole partner for the female 
patient.  
Female patients of childbearing potential should refrain from donation of ova from th e first dose  
through [ADDRESS_154002] dose of study treatment.  
Male Patients  
Male patients (even with a history of vasectomy) with partners of childbearing potential must use a male barrier method of contraception (ie, male condom with spermicide) in  addition to a 
second highly effective method of acceptable contraception from the first dose through [ADDRESS_154003] dose of study treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception for female partners include: 
• hormonal injection  
• combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870]/progestogen- only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]  
• combined hormonal patch  
• combined hormonal vaginal ring  
• surgical method (bilateral tubal ligation or Essure [hysteroscopic bilateral tubal occlusion])  
• hormonal implant  
• hormonal or nonhormonal intrauterine device.  
An acceptable second method of contraception for male patients is vasectomy that has been performed at least 90 days prior to the screening visit, with verbal confirmation of surgical success.  
For male patients (even with a history of vasectomy),  sexual intercourse with female partners 
who are pregnant or breastfeeding should be avoided unless condoms are used from the first dose until [ADDRESS_154004] dose of study treatment.  
Sexual Abstinence and Same -sex Relationships 
Patients who practice true abstinence, because of the patient’s lifestyle choice (ie, the patient should not become abstinent just for the purpose of study participation), are exempt from contraceptive requirements. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. If a patient who is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF becomes sexually active, he or she must agree to use contraception as described previously. 
For patients who are exclusively in same-sex relationships, contraceptive requirements do not 
apply. If a patient who is in a same- sex rel ationship at the time of signing the ICF becomes 
engaged in a heterosexual relationship, he or she must agree to use contraception as described 
previously.

Notes:  
General note: on days of laboratory assessments, discharged patients will have a home visit. On days of no laboratory assessm ents, discharged patients will complete all 
assessments via telephone or telemedicine visi ts. Patients will receive instructions for home administration of study treatment and a diary to capture all doses after a discharge.  
a Patients will undergo assessment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135631] 2 if judged to be ready for discharge. If 
discharged, patients will then be requested to take study treatment at home (as prescribed) up to Day 14. End of Treatment assessments at Day 14 (+2 days) (at home or site visit) will be performed. A Day 5 (+/- 1 day) visit (at home or site visit) will be performed if the patient is discharged prior to Day 5. If the patient is discharged after 
completion of treatment and before the follow up visit, he/she will be followed up on Day 28 (±2 days) for study assessments  (a telephone or telemedicine visit). Post 
discharge, assessments will be done by [CONTACT_135716], except for Day 5 (+/- 1 day) , Day 14  (+2 days) , and Early 
Termination (ET) of Study Treatment, which would be a home or site visit. If the discharge, ET  or Early Withdrawal visit falls within the window of a schedule Day visit, the  
assessments for the visits can be combined as one visit.  
b Initial sentinel cohort of 20  patients to be enrolled to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK. Enrollment will pause after the 20
th patient in the sentinel cohort has started 
treatment, until the results of the interim analysis are known. Once the 20th patient in the sentinel cohort has completed 14 days of treatment, an unblinded DMC will assess 
the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK of 100  mg BID antroquinonol in COVID -19 patients in the sentinel cohort (interim analysis 1). The DMC will issue a 
recommendation to enroll patients for the expansion cohort, or to stop the study depending on the safety and futility assessm ent. Once the 80th patient has been enrolled and 
completed 14 days o f treatment, the DMC will review the safety , tolerability  and efficacy data (interim analysis  2). Enrollment may be restricted at the 100th patient until the 
DMC has completed the assessment to prevent excessive enrollment.  
c Patients must satisfy all of the  criteria at the s creening visit unless otherwise stated (e.g. some criteria can be evaluated at Day 1 if needed).  
d Daily study treatment administration from Day 1 to Day 14.  
e A complete physical examination (general appearance, HEENT, lymphatic, cardiovascu lar, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and dermatological 
systems) will be performed at screening. Vital signs (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate) to be assessed during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], on discharge, ET/EOT 
and Follow -up/EOS visit (for site  or in -person  visits only). Pulse oximetry to measure SpO 2 will be collected in the eCRF at screening (room air) after screening with vital

ET/EOT. Urine pregnancy test may be performed but must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test (screening only). The Follow -up/EOS vis it test will be a urine 
pregnancy test only (pregnancy test kit will be provided to the patient when discharged).  Additionally, local/country regulations will be followed as applicable (eg., monthly 
pregnancy test after the last dose of study treatment in female subjects of childbearing potential).  
h Efficacy parameter assessments: [1] Confirmation of whether the patient is discharged to home, is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or has wor sened to require an ICU. The number of days a 
patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135632]. [2] PCR testing for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_154010] of care can be used to determine eligibility. All subsequent tests will be performed by a central 
laboratory at baseline/ Day 1, D ay 5 (+/-1 day) and Day 14  (+2 days) . Also at Follow -up/EOS if patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Either nasopharyngeal or mid -turbinate samples are 
allowed for central testing. Only one method should be used throughout the study for the participant. [3]  Clinical improvement score will be measured using the WHO 
COVID-19 Clinical Improvement Ordinal Scale (refer to  Appendix 7). [4] Patient mortality will be recorded up to Day 28. Every effort will be made to ascertain vital status 
in all randomized patients (eg,  with a vital records search) up to Day 28. [5] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_135633], non -invasive 
ventilation, high -flow oxygen, or ECMO. The date of the start of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_135634]; no daily assessment is needed. [6] COVID- 19 
symptoms (presence or absence of dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath/ difficulty in breathing), or chills/rigors, myalgia  (muscle pain), headache, sore throat, and loss of 
taste or smell; other symptoms that could be related to COVID -19) will also be assessed during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], on discharge, ET/EOT and Follow -up/EOS visit (at the site, 
home visit, or via telephone or telemedicine if patient has been discharged).  
i Safety parameter assessment s: [1] AEs will be assessed from signing the ICF (during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135635]) daily to Day 5 (+/-1 day) , then Days 7  
(+1 day), 14 (+2 days), 28 (±2 days) until Follow -up/EOS; [2] Standard safety laboratory tests will include all parameters of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis 
(refer to  Appendix 2) and will be performed as applicable at screening, at predose on Day 1, and at Day 5  (+/- 1 day) , and Day 14 (+2 days) (a home visit, or a site visit if 
discharged ). Screening laboratory tests will be assessed by a local laboratory, and baseline and postbaseline laboratory tests will be assessed by a central laboratory. If del ays 
on transportation of the samples is encountered, then local safety laboratory samples can be obtained instead for samples that can’t be frozen for shipment (e.g. hematology 
and urine). Baseline laboratory tests can be done once patients eligibility is confirmed . [3] 12-lead ECGs to be performed at screening while the patient is in supi[INVESTIGATOR_135636] 5  minutes. Additionally, 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at Day  14/EOT or early treatment termination while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135637]  14. [4] Prior and concomitant medications to be recorded from screening assessments daily to Day 5 (+/ - 1 day) , then Days 7  
(+1 day) , 14 (+2 days), 28 (± 2 days).  
j Blood samples will be collected for patients in the sentinel cohort (first 20  patients) only on Day  [ADDRESS_154011] study drug dose of the day. For discharged patients  (ie, on Day  2)/outpatient visit, the 12 -hour sample can be omitted. On 
Day 14, if patients are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], predose and 2 hours postdose samples (after the first study drug dose of the day) will be collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
include C trough, Cmax. tmax, AUC 0-1ast, and AUC tau. Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965]  2 prior to PK sampling will not need to return to the clinic for sample 
collection.  
k The PK of antroquinonol will be assessed in the sentinel cohort. The PK samples  will not be collected for the expansion cohort.

Protocol Version  Date  Reason for version change  
Protocol Version 4.0  08 July 2021  This version was updated to address feedback 
from Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and 
Investigators.  
Protocol Version 3. 1 29 March  2021  This version was updated to  clarify and adapt to 
changes on management of COVID -19. 
Protocol Version 3.0  11 March  2021  This version was updated to clarify and adapt to 
changes on management of COVID -19. 
Protocol Version  2.0  02 September  2020  This version was updated based on the ‘study 
may proceed’ letter from the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) on Version 1.1, and 
addressed feedback from DMC and Investigators.  
Protocol Version  1.1 01 June 2020  Submitted to the FDA in response to their 
questions. 
Original Protocol Version  1.0 14 May 2020  Submitted to the FDA in response to their 
questions. 
The primary changes in this amendment, along with the rationale for the/each change as 
appropriate, are:  
1. Section  4.1:  
• New inclusion criterion #3: Inclusion requirement of oxygen saturation <94% at 
room air at screening was added following the DMC recommendation to ensure the “sicker” of the mild/moderate patients can be enrolled.  
• Current i nclusion criterion #4 (previous inclusion criterion #3): Based on DMC 
and Investigator’s feedback, this criterion was modified to exclude patients requir ing oxygen therapy by m ask with reservoir for treatment of severe Cov id-19 
pneumonia. 
2. Section  7.2.3: 
• Edits made to allow samples to be obtained f or local laboratories tests in case of 
delays in transportation of safety samples to the central laboratory . 
3. Section  [IP_ADDRESS]: 
• Based on  site’s local practices, collection of non -oral body temperature (i.e., 
tympanic, rectal, axillary, and frontal) was also included.  
• Peripheral capi[INVESTIGATOR_19365] (SpO
2) assessment was aligned with vital 
signs assessments. Data of fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO 2) will be collected 
along with partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) (if PaO [ADDRESS_154015] of care).

09 July 2021  Page 3 of 13 CONFIDENTIAL  4. Section  8.2: 
• To be consistent with the statistical analysis plan (SAP),  the Intention- to-Treat 
(ITT) set will be the primary analysis po pulation for efficacy and the modified 
ITT (mITT) and Per Protocol Set (PPS) will be the supportive analysis 
populations for efficacy analysis. 
5. Appendix 5:  
• Schedule of assessments table and footnote ‘e’ were updated to include data to be captured for oxygenation and their assessments .  
• SpO2 assessment was aligned with vital signs assessments.  
• Schedule of assessments table and footnote ‘i’ was updated to include e dits to 
allow samples to be obtained for local laboratories tests in case of delays in transportation of safety samples to the central laboratory. 
Minor changes not displayed in this summary are:  
1. The synopsis  was updated according to the changes in the protocol body, as applicable. 
2. The versi on number and date were updated throughout the protocol. 
3. Editorial, typographical, and formatting errors that did not change the meaning of the text were corrected, as necessary.  
4. Abbreviations were added, as appropriate. 
5. Due to Brand Transition, name [CONTACT_135728] ‘Covance’ to ‘LabCorp Drug Development’ was updated on protocol Title page and in the protocol header. No edits in Sections 4.4.7 
and [IP_ADDRESS] where it will remain as ‘Covance’ Patient Safety Services.

Screening laboratory test will be assessed by a local laboratory, and baseline and postbaseline 
laboratory tests will be assessed by a central laboratory. If delays in transportation of the 
samples are encountered, then local safety laboratory samples can be obtained instead for 
samples that can’t be frozen for shipment (e.g. hematology and urine). Baseline laboratory 
tests can be done once patients eligibility is confirmed. The investigator will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.

Notes:  
General note: on days of labor atory assessments, discharged patients will have a home visit. On days of no laboratory assessments, discharged patients will  complete all 
assessments via telephone or telemedicine visits. Patients will receive instructions for home administration of study  treatment and a diary to capture all doses after a discharge.  
a Patients will undergo assessment during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135631] 2 if judged to be ready for discharge. If 
discharged, patients will then be requested to take study treatment at home (as prescribed) up to Day 14. End of Treatment assessments at Day 14 (+2 days) (at home or site visit) will be performed. A Day 5 (+/- 1 day) visit (at home or site visit) will be performed if the patient is discharged prior to Day 5. If the patient is discharged after 
completion of treatment and before the follow up visit, he/she will be followed up on Day 28 (±2 days) for study assessments (a telephone or telemedicine visit). Post discharge, assessmen ts will be done by [CONTACT_135716], except for Day 5 (+/ - 1 day), Day 14 (+2 days), and Early 
Termination (ET) of Study Treatment, which would be a home or site visit. If the discharge, ET or Early Withdrawal visit falls within the window of a schedule Day visit, the assessments for the visits can be combined as one visit.  
b Initial sentinel cohort of 20  patients to be enrolled to assess safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK. Enrollment will pause after t he 20
th patient in the sentinel cohort has started 
treatment, until the results of the interim analysis are known. Once the 20th patient in the sentinel cohort has completed 14 days of treatment, an unblinded DMC will assess 
the safety, tolerability, effic acy, and PK of 100 mg BID antroquinonol in COVID -19 patients in the sentinel cohort (interim analysis 1). The DMC will issue a 
recommendation to enroll patients for the expansion cohort, or to stop the study depending on the safety and futility assessm ent. Once the 80th patient has been enrolled and 
completed 14 days of treatment, the DMC will review the safety, tolerability and efficacy data (interim analysis 2). Enrollment may be restricted at the 100th patient until the 
DMC has completed the assessment to prevent excessive enrollment.  
c Patients must satisfy all of the criteria at the screening visit unless otherwise stated (e.g. some criteria can be evaluated  at Day 1 if needed).  
d Daily study treatment administration from Day 1 to Day 14.  
e A complete physical examination (general appearance, HEENT, lymphatic, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurolog ical, and dermatological 
systems) will be performed at screening. Vital signs (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, blood pressure, and p ulse rate) to be assessed during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], on discharge, ET/EOT 
and Follow -up/EOS visit (for site or in -person visits only). Pulse oximetry to measure SpO 2 (>94% on room air) will be collected in the eCRF during the study if done per 
standard of car e. Height and body weight will be measured only at screening.  
f Chest x -ray or CT scan should show findings consistent with pneumonia due to COVID -[ADDRESS_154026] (Note: only [ADDRESS_154027] be done for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], ET of Study Treatment, or ET of Study). Chest x -ray or CT scan 
does not need to be repeated at screening if performed as standard of care and done within [ADDRESS_154028] discharge.  
Protocol Version 4.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
LabCorp Drug Development Study: 8427146   Protocol Reference Number: GHCovid -2-[ADDRESS_154029] is to be performed in female patients of child -bearing potential at a local (site) laboratory, during screening or pretreatment Day  1, discharge, and 
ET/EOT. Urine pregnancy test may be performed but must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test (screening only). The Follow -up/EOS visit test will be a urine 
pregnancy test only (pregnancy test kit will be provided to the patient when discharged). Additionally, local/country reg ulations will be followed as applicable (eg., monthly 
pregnancy test after the last dose of study treatment in female subjects of childbearing potential).  
h Efficacy parameter assessments: [1] Confirmation of whether the patient is  discharged to home, is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or has worsened to require an ICU. The number of days a 
patient has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135655]. [2] PCR testing for SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_154030] already done as standar d of care can be used to determine eligibility. All subsequent tests will be performed by a central 
laboratory at baseline/Day 1, Day 5 (+/ -1 day) and Day 14 (+2 days). Also at Follow -up/EOS if patient is  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Either nasopharyngeal or mid -turbinate samples are 
allowed for central testing. Only one method should be used throughout the study for the participant. [3]  Clinical improvement score will be measured using the WHO 
COVID-19 Clinical Improvem ent Ordinal Scale (refer to  Appendix  7). [4] Patient mortality will be recorded up to Day 28. Every effort will be made to ascertain vital status 
in all randomized patients (eg, with a vital records search) up to Day 28. [5 ] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_135656], non -invasive 
ventilation, high -flow oxygen, or ECMO. The date of the start of the respir atory intervention must be recorded in the eCRF; no daily assessment  is needed. [6] COVID -19 
symptoms (presence or absence of dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath/ difficulty in breathing), or chills/rigors, myalgia (muscle pain), headache, sore throat, and loss of 
taste or smell; other symptoms that could be related to COVID -19) will als o be assessed during hosp italization, on discharge, ET/EOT and Follow -up/EOS visit (at the site, 
home visit, or via telephone or telemedicine if patient has been discharged) . 
i Safety parameter assessments: [1] AEs will be assessed from signing the I CF (during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135635]) daily to Day 5 (+/ -1 day), then Days 7 
(+1 day), 14 (+2 days), 28 (±2 days) until Follow -up/EOS; [2] Standard sa fety laboratory tests will include all parameters of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis 
(refer to  Appendix  2) and will be performed as applicable at screening, at p redose on Day 1, and at Day 5 (+/ - 1 day), and Day 14 (+2 days) (a home visit, or a site visit if 
discharged). Screening laboratory tests will be assessed by a local laborato ry, and baseline and postbaseline laboratory tests will be assessed by a central laboratory. Baseline 
laboratory tests can be done once patients eligibility is confirmed. [3]  12-lead ECGs to be performed at screening while the patient is in supi[INVESTIGATOR_135657] 
5 minutes. Additionally, 12-lead ECGs will be performed at Day  14/EOT o r early treatment termination while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135658]  14. [4] Prior and concomitant medications to be rec orded from screening assessments daily to Day 5 (+/ - 1 day), then Days 7 (+1 day), 14 
(+2 days), 28 (± 2 days).  
j Blood samples will be collected for patients in the sentinel cohort (first 20  patients) only on Day  [ADDRESS_154031] study drug dose of the day. For discharged patients (ie, on Day  2)/outpatient visit, the 12 -hour sample can be omitted. On 
Day 14, if patients are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], predos e and 2  hours postdose samples (after the first study drug dose of the day) will be collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
include C trough, Cmax. tmax, AUC 0-1ast, and AUC tau. Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965]  2 prior to PK sampling will not need to return to the clinic for sample 
collection.  
k The PK of antroquinonol will be assessed in the sentinel cohort. The PK samples will not be collected for the expansion cohort.

COVID-19 Clinical  Improvement Ordinal Scale (refer to  Appendix  7). [4] Patient mortality will be recorde d up to Day 28. Every effort will be made to ascertain vital status 
in all randomized patients (eg, with a vital records search) up to Day 28. [5] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_135659], non -invasive 
ventilation, high -flow oxygen, or ECMO. The date of the start of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_135660]; no daily assessment  is needed. [6] COVID -19 
symptoms ( presence or absence of dry cough, dyspnea (shortness of breath/ difficulty in breathing), or chil ls/rigors, myalgia (muscle pain), headache, sore throat, and loss of 
taste or smell; other symptoms that could be related to COVID -19) will also be assessed du ring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], on discharge, ET/EOT and Follow -up/EOS visit (at the site, 
home visit, or via telephone or telemedicine if patient has been discharged).  
i Safety parameter assessments: [1] AEs will be assessed from signing the ICF (during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478] p ost discharge at home) daily to Day 5 (+/ -1 day), then Days 7 
(+1 day), 14 (+2 days), 28 (±2 days) until Follow -up/EOS; [2] Standard safety laboratory tests will include  all parameters of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis 
(refe r to Appendix  2) and will be performed as applicable at screening, at predose on Day 1, and at Day 5 ( +/- 1 day), and Day 14 (+2 days) (a home visit, or a site visit if 
discharged). Screening laboratory tests will be assessed by a local laboratory, and baseline and postbaseline laboratory tests will be assessed by a central laboratory. If delays 
on transportation of the samples is encountered, then local safety laboratory samples can be obtained instead for samples tha t can’t be frozen for shipment (e. g. 
hematology and urine).  Baseline laboratory tests can be done once patients eligibility is confirmed. [3]  12-lead ECGs to be performed at screening while the patient is in 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_135657] 5 minutes. Additionally, 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at Day  14/EOT or early treatment termination while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135661]  14. [4] Prior and concomitant medications to be recorded from screening assessments daily  to Day 5 (+/ - 1 
day), then Days 7 (+1 day), 14 (+2 days), 28 (± 2 days).  
j Blood samples will be collected for patients in the sentinel cohort (first 20  patients) only on Day  [ADDRESS_154039] study drug dose of the day. For discharged patients (ie, on Day  2)/outpatient visit, the 12 -hour sample can be omitted. On 
Day 14, if patients are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], predose and 2 hours postdose samples (after the first study drug dose of the day) will be collected. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
include C trough, Cmax. tmax, AUC 0-1ast, and AUC tau. Patients who are discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965]  2 prior to PK sampling will not need to return to the clinic for sa mple 
collection.  
k The PK of antroquinonol will be assessed in the sentinel cohort. The PK samples will not be collected for the expansion cohor t.

Purpose
PRIMARY PROBLEM ADDRESSED
Current evidence-based type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) self-management interventions 
target glycemic control but ignore other modifiable health concerns prevalent in T1D such 
as hypertension and obesity.  Exercise interventions could provide a novel solution if they 
could innovatively address the diabetes management and psychosocial challenges around 
exercise posed by T1D.  These include especially keepi[INVESTIGATOR_657937] a safe range 
during and after exercise (i.e., glycemic stability), and overcoming the fear of hypoglycemia. 
PRIMARY PURPOSE
Develop a data-driven exercise intervention for T1D and evaluate its feasibility, 
acceptability, and mathematical robustness.
SECONDARY PURPOSE
Determine mechanisms underlying the link between T1D-related barriers (glycemic
stability, fear of hypoglycemia) and physical activity behavior.
Objectives
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
1-1. Evaluate the intervention for feasibility.
1-2. Evaluate the intervention for acceptability (i.e., user satisfaction).
1-3. Evaluate the intervention app algorithm’s accuracy to predict lapses in exercise 
behavior ahead of time. 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES
2-1. Examine whether recognized T1D-related physical activity barriers (fear of 
hypoglycemia, glycemic variation) predict momentary and long-term variation in 
motivation states for physical activity.
2-2. Examine whether motivation states for physical activity predict momentary and long-
term variation in physical activity behavior change, adherence, and maintenance resulting 
from a T1D motivational physical activity intervention.
2-3. Qualitatively identify determinants and sequalae of motivation states for physical 
activity among adults with T1D.
Study Population
Adults 30-[ADDRESS_887161] significantly different needs regarding 
exercise (exercise dependence, desire to improve body image) and self-management 
(transitions in care, residence, and professional life), while those above it have 
significantly different needs regarding exercise including mobility issues and substantial 
modifications to exercise.

121 Background
1.1 Background
PRIMARY AIMS: EXERCISE SUPPORT
Exercise for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an important area for intervention development.
Intensive diet and insulin self-management are required for people with T1D to mitigate 
snacking, physical activity, and mental stress-associated glycemic fluctuations. There are 
several modifiable cardiovascular risk factors including overweight (60%), hypertension 
(40%), dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (60%), and inadequate physical activity (67%-82%)3 exacerbating their 
already elevated risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality4. Existing T1D self-
management interventions (psychoeducation5-7, diabetes devices8-12, digital platforms13-18) 
have improved achievement of glycemic targets, however none of the current interventions 
are effective for cardiovascular risk factors or lifestyle behaviors when measured with reliable 
instruments19,20. For instance, intensive insulin therapy in the Diabetes Control and 
Complications trial while decreasing HbA1c increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_139430], and this 
weight gain correlated with lipid panel and blood pressure deteriorations21,22. Thus, T1D self-
management interventions that address health targets beyond glycemic control are needed. 
Physical activity interventions can improve health outcomes (e.g., aerobic capacity, lipid 
profile)23. Unfortunately, most people with T1D do not regularly engage in physical activity24,25 
indicating a need for novel interventions.
For purposes of describing this study, T1D will also refer to other types of diabetes that 
present similarly from the standpoint of behavioral self-management considerations. These 
types are the others with absolute insulin deficiency: latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood 
and diabetes secondary to pancreatitis.
Physical activity with T1D has been linked to glycemic destabilization and fear of 
hypoglycemia. 
Lack of engagement in physical activity stems from the unique challenges of physical activity 
with T1D26.  Physical activity with T1D can dysregulate blood glucose, leading to hypo- and/or 
hyperglycemia during and up to 24hr later due to consumption of energy, increased insulin 
sensitivity, release of counterregulatory hormones, and various combinations thereof. The 
direction and magnitude of these glycemic fluctuations vary according to type of physical 
activity, personal insulin sensitivity, insulin-on-board, and hormone concentrations27. There is 
also high interindividual variation in these responses due to factors not well understood27,28. 
Predicting these fluctuations to adjust diet and insulin is challenging.  
When these fluctuations bring blood glucose into clinically unsafe ranges, symptoms 
can require halting of physical activity. As well, a context where these symptoms are likely 
(e.g., downward-trending blood glucose or high insulin-on-board) can preclude the start of 
physical activity. Furthermore, repeated exposure to these symptoms leads to fear of 
hypoglycemia, the most reported barrier to physical activity among people with T1D29. This 
fear can motivate people with T1D to avoid physical activity due to remembering past 
symptoms  and anticipating future occurrence of symptoms. 
This investigation does not address exercise for type 2 diabetes (T2D) which faces 
different barriers compared to T1D. There is less risk of hypoglycemia due to the nature of the 
medication treatment, and therefore less fear of hypoglycemia. Meanwhile there is greater 
associated stigma, since the disease has etiology rooted in modifiable lifestyle behaviors. In 
addition, obesity as a comorbidity is more common and more severe. Therefore there is 
greater relevance of obesity-related barriers such as joint pain, exercise equipment being too 
small, and weight stigma.

13Knowledge and technology are available that could support exercise for T1D.
Patients and their providers are encouraged to follow consensus statement guidelines for 
monitoring blood glucose levels and adjusting diet and insulin before, during, and after 
exercise to limit safety hazards and optimize benefits26. In addition, continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) is a now widely used (30%)[ADDRESS_887172], by [CONTACT_657990] “snapshot” values, CGM helps the patient identify risk of exercise-induced hypo- or hyper-
glycemia and adjust insulin and diet accordingly and mitigate fear of hypoglycemia.  Second, 
CGM presents users with time-series feedback of their glucose levels, allowing them to infer 
whether the timing of behaviors such as exercise (e.g., morning vs. afternoon, after vs. before 
insulin bolus) contributes to achievement of the target range31.  Patients with type [ADDRESS_887173] CGM users regularly view the real-time display of current blood glucose values and 
trending direction but few use mobile medical applications to comprehensively view CGM data 
(17%)30.  These metrics are discussed with providers at clinic appointments34, but provider 
discussions often do not translate to daily self-management decisions by [CONTACT_1962].  Studies 
working with people with T1D to develop and test how they could independently use in-depth 
CGM information to promote safe, consistent, and effective exercise represent an 
underexplored, promising area for intervention development.
We propose to address the gap between the available relevant medical information and 
translation to successful exercise by [CONTACT_113484] T1D by [CONTACT_657991]-Motivation-
Behavioral Skills (IMBS) model (Figure 1)35.  The IMBS model has been successfully applied 
to self-management interventions for T1D36,37 and other chronic diseases38,39 and explained 
variance in self-management outcomes35,40,41.  In the present application, we propose to 
develop mobile tools that leverage the diabetes literature, CGM data, and informatics to derive 
the needed components of IMBS for exercise (information about exercise, motivational 
encouragement to exercise, and feedback on long-term exercise outcomes) and deliver it to 
people with T1D.

SECONDARY AIMS: PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS FOR BEHAVIOR CHANGE

14Rationale for determining real-time mechanisms underlying physical activity behavior 
and T1D-related barriers. 
Fear of hypoglycemia has been measured as a “trait” (i.e., personality-specific) but in just one 
study as a “state” (i.e., situation-specific)42. Participants reported their state fear of having 
hypoglycemia over the next 12hr42. Responses had significant intraindividual variation and 
correlation with the related construct of blood glucose variability, indicating the need to further 
study fear of hypoglycemia as a state variable. Glycemic destabilization meanwhile is 
recognized to cause intense symptoms that acutely preclude physical activity, but no study 
has addressed the possible impact of more nuanced changes. E.g., downward-trending 
glucose could affect motivation to be active even if not projecting an excursion outside the 
clinically safe range.  
Conceptual model of barriers to change.
Addressing this weakness, we and others have begun demonstrating that such affective (i.e., 
automatic) feeling states are the primary motivational factors driving humans to engage in 
physical activity43-47. Furthermore, these motivational factors have highly transient effects, 
exhibiting more state than trait qualities. Our team developed the Wants and Aversions for 
Neuromuscular Tasks (WANT) model to explain these relationships48-52 based on 
Kavanaugh’s model of affective motivation states determined by [CONTACT_657992], affective 
valence (pleasure/displeasure), and arousal/activation53. Past models by [CONTACT_657993] (SCT) constructs (i.e., self-efficacy, outcome 
expectations, sociocultural traits)54-56. Therefore, we must test not only SCT constructs but 
also WANT model real-time states to link T1D-related barriers to physical activity (Figure 2).  
In sum, our secondary objectives will address underlying psychological mechanisms 
of the intervention. Knowledge of these mechanisms would improve tailoring. For example, if 
we find an individual’s lack of motivation for physical activity is predicted by [CONTACT_657994]-
average starting blood glucose, a below-average blood glucose reading an hour before 
opportunities for physical activity would trigger a reminder for additional carbohydrates. On 
the other hand, if we find the predictor is fear of hypoglycemia, the message would provide 
psychological support such as cognitive behavioral therapy for fear of hypoglycemia57. To 
generate the needed mechanistic knowledge, we have proposed the secondary aims of this 
study.

change. Dotted lines indicate alternative hypothesis that T1D-related barriers directly impact 
physical activity without mediation by [CONTACT_657995].

151.2.1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_657938]-aged adults with T1D58,59 (Yale 
HIC #[PHONE_13613]) 
Working with an industry partner (GlucoseZone™, FitscriptLLC, New Haven, CT) we 
customized a mobile digital application providing on-demand instructional exercise videos, 
access to a text-based exercise coach ([CONTACT_642584], an expert in T1D exercise), daily electronic 
self-monitoring diaries, and monthly reports of BG and exercise data discussed with [CONTACT_642584] 
in a motivational enhancement therapy session. We evaluated its feasibility, safety, and 
acceptability in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Participants were followed for 2 weeks of baseline and 10 weeks 
of application use and completed assessments by [CONTACT_657996], home-based clinical assessments, surveys, and interviews. Exercise was tracked by 
[CONTACT_657997], electronic self-monitoring diaries for non-video guided exercise, and 
Apple Watch heart rate. All participants wore continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and 
dispensed insulin by [CONTACT_155828] (Bluetooth smartpen or continuous infusion pump); 
these data were captured by [CONTACT_941] “Share” feature of proprietary websites. 
Recruitment. Using targeted Facebook news feed advertisements, word-of-mouth spread on 
Facebook and emails by [CONTACT_657998] T1D, and approaching patients at clinical visits we 
recruited adults (N=20, 55% F, 42.3±15.0 years old, 20.5±15.3 years of T1D) with risk factors 
suggesting need for exercise intervention: body mass index 29.5±5.1 kg/m2, median 3 (IQR 
0,7) daily exercise minutes, and high avoidance of exercise due to fear of hypoglycemia 
(3.9±0.8 out of 5). News feed advertisements were more cost-effective than clinic recruitment 
($41.11 vs $250.00 per eligible volunteer), captured higher-risk participants than role model 
word-of-mouth advertising (88% vs 25% obesity, 88% vs 25% elevated A1c), with faster yield 
than all other methods (8 participants enrolled over 20 days of advertising). Totally the 
eligibility rate was 20 / 47 = 43%.
Feasibility.  Assessment completion was 85%-100% for all outcomes. Participants exercised 
with the app an average of 2.4±1.7 times per week and attended 35 / 40 monthly discussions 
(88%). Participants were queried on each non-exercise day about their barriers to exercise, 
and app malfunction was reported as a barrier <1% of the time. CGM data capture was 
92.5±7.2% during baseline and 88.3±9.8% during weeks 9-10, with 95% of timepoints meeting 
literature standard ≥75%60. Accelerometer wear time at baseline met the literature standard of 
≥10 hours per day on 6.7±0.[ADDRESS_887174] of 
≥4 days per week, and accelerometer data at follow-up are pending analysis. Participants 
completed a median of 98% (IQR 88%, 100%) of the 84 possible mobile diaries, with 90% 
meeting literature standard ≥70%.
Safety. There were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_657939]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_657940]. Ash, Weinzimer, and 
Nally biweekly for safety concerns.
Acceptability. The overall intervention rating was moderate (3.4±0.9 out of 5). Participants 
rated the monthly feedback and coaching discussions most acceptable of all components 
(4.4±0.8 out of 5) but requested more frequent feedback and coaching sessions. The elements 
designed for more frequent touchpoints were rated somewhat lower (exercise videos 3.8±0.9, 
text-based exercise coach 3.2±0.8, daily diaries 2.2±0.6), indicating need for more 
automated and frequent support as planned in the current study.
Preliminary Efficacy. Participants increased their exercise from a median of 4 (IQR 0, 41) to 
64 (20, 129) minutes per week (d= 0.71).  Body mass index increased (d= 0.57). Systolic blood 
pressure (d= -0.45), HbA1c (d= -0.42), and mean sensor BG (d= -0.41) tended to slightly 
decrease while total daily insulin (d= 0.09) was not different. In summary, the intervention was 
safe and showed promising efficacy, supporting virtually delivered exercise guidance if it 
can be delivered more intensively and sustainably.

and two in progress (#[PHONE_13615], #[PHONE_13616]). The latter two occurred in virtual settings. 
These trials have had similarly high feasibility and acceptability as our adult study detailed 
above. None have had instances of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis. 
1.2.3. We can use data from momentary surveys and continuous biometric monitoring 
to predict physical activity among adults with T1D. 
Using data from the above study with adults (c.f sect 1.2.1, 1,125 person-days), we developed 
a deep neural network to predict the successful completion of physical activity on each day 
(≥10min sustained) using [ADDRESS_887176] physical activity for the adults with T1D (80% accuracy, 82%

172 Rationale/Significance
2.1 Rationale and Study Significance 
PRIMARY AIMS:
Current evidence-based T1D self-management interventions target glycemic control but 
ignore other modifiable health concerns prevalent in T1D such as hypertension and obesity.  
Exercise interventions could provide a novel solution if they could innovatively address the 
diabetes management and psychosocial challenges around exercise posed by T1D.  
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) allows patients and providers to comprehensively track 
the short- and long-term outcomes of exercise.  Evidence-based interventions to translate 
CGM technology into sustainable adherence to exercise-related behaviors are lacking.  
SECONDARY AIMS:
Physical activity with T1D has been linked to glycemic destabilization and fear of 
hypoglycemia, but there is a need to determine real-time mechanisms underlying this link. 
Fear of hypoglycemia has been measured as a “trait” (i.e., personality-specific) but in just one 
study as a “state” (i.e., situation-specific)42. Participants reported their state fear of having 
hypoglycemia over the next 12hr42. Responses had significant intraindividual variation and 
correlation with the related construct of blood glucose variability, indicating the need to further 
study fear of hypoglycemia as a state variable. Glycemic destabilization meanwhile is 
recognized to cause intense symptoms that acutely preclude physical activity, but no study 
has addressed the possible impact of more nuanced changes. E.g., downward-trending 
glucose could affect motivation to be active even if not projecting an excursion outside the 
clinically safe range.  
Addressing this weakness, we and others have begun demonstrating that such affective 
(i.e., automatic) feeling states are the primary motivational factors driving humans to engage 
in physical activity43-47. Furthermore, these motivational factors have highly transient effects, 
exhibiting more state than trait qualities. Therefore, we must test these real-time states to link 
T1D-related barriers to physical activity (Figure 2 in section 1.1).  
2.2 Risks
Confidentiality: Due to the collection of private identifiable information, there is a possibility 
of a security breach compromising subject confidentiality. Such breaches are extremely 
uncommon when proper IRB-approved precautions are taken.
Several steps will be taken to safeguard the confidentiality of subjects and their data.  All 
research data collected outside of the mobile applications will be assigned a study participant 
number and that number will only identify participants in digital databases on REDCap or 
Actigraph Actilife software (downloads Actigraph GT9X blinded hip & wrist watch). Audio-
recorded interviews and orientation sessions will be transcribed and names, places, and any 
other identifying information will be removed.  The names of participants will not be associated 
with this data and assessments will be maintained according to participant study number. A 
master list connecting participant study numbers to participant names will be kept on a secure 
server where it can only be accessed by [CONTACT_528696].  Any information published 
as a result of the study will be such that it will not permit identification of any participant.

Hypoglycemia: There is risk of hypoglycemia due to exercise. The magnitude of these events 
can range from a few minutes of mild symptoms (e.g., dizziness, fatigue) to prolonged severe 
symptoms (e.g., loss of consciousness, diabetic ketoacidosis).
The T1D standard of care70 recognizes the probability of these events as common in the 
context of daily living. Our previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_657948] T1D (c.f. sect 1.2.1, 1.2.2) had 
some epi[INVESTIGATOR_657949], but they quickly resolved following 
appropriate rescue carbohydrates and there were no severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], ketoacidosis, or other 
adverse events. 
We will apply the same safety protocols to minimize these risks in the current study. To ensure 
safety, all participants will receive clearance to participate in the exercise by [CONTACT_658003]. Weinzimer or Nally. They will self-monitor their blood glucose using a 
CGM. Those without their own monitor upon study entry will have one provided.  CGM has 
reduced risk of hypoglycemia during and after exercise in randomized controlled trials 
compared to usual care (reviewed in53). 
They will also be provided a comprehensive exercise safety orientation which is detailed in 
Appendix 22a. Briefly, the information includes review of devices, supplies, space, safe 
glucose ranges and carbohydrate snacking for exercise, reminders from CGM training 
pertinent to exercise, insulin adjustments around exercise, watching for symptoms, and who 
to call with concerns. They will be provided and instructed to keep carbohydrate-containing 
foods and drinks (eg, orange juice, glucose tablets) available to use when indicated by [CONTACT_658004]. In addition, they will be educated regarding the American Diabetes 
Association guidelines for self-monitoring blood glucose and urine ketones, if indicated, and 
appropriate adjustments of diet and insulin before, during, and after engaging in exercise70,71. 
For instance, if blood glucose is less than 90 mg/dL, they can consume 10-20g of fast-acting 
carbohydrates (eg, 4 oz of orange juice or 3 glucose tablets) and wait to commence with 
exercise until blood glucose is confirmed to be above 90 mg/dL. If blood glucose is greater

20than 270 mg/dL and not associated with a recent meal, they must check their blood for ketones 
and avoid exercise if they have ketones ≥1.0 mmol/L.  
Participants will be encouraged to be vigilant for symptoms of hypoglycemia during exercise 
and for the remainder of the day because exercise increases the risk for nocturnal 
hypoglycemia.  The symptoms they will be encouraged to be vigilant for include cold, clammy 
skin, pallor, difficulty concentrating, shakiness, lack of coordination, irritability, hostility, and 
poor behavior, a staggering gait, fatigue, nervousness, excessive hunger, headache, blurred 
vision and dizziness, and abdominal pain or nausea.  In these instances, they will be advised 
to refrain from exercise while checking blood glucose. 
Participants will be monitored for exercise-associated events (hypo- and hyperglycemia, 
diabetic ketoacidosis, other health risks) as detailed in the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(Sect 8.7). In brief, a research staff member will daily review each participant’s CGM data, 
fingerstick glucose tests, ketone tests, exercise start times, and diary records of hypoglycemia 
and other clinical events (see Data and Safety Monitoring Plan “Tracking” section) each of the 
first [ADDRESS_887179], or other clinical event will result in immediate 
discontinuation of exercise until a physician has alerted the participant and the participant’s 
primary diabetes care provider to the issue and developed a prevention strategy, consulting 
with the primary diabetes care provider as needed. For instances of a missed test, physician 
contact [CONTACT_658005], followed by [CONTACT_658006]. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ash and a study physician (Drs. Weinzimer or Nally) will review 
the above data plus carbohydrate and insulin dosing around exercise, every 2 weeks during 
the clinical trial.  Participants exhibiting patterns confirmed by [CONTACT_658007]-induced hypo- or hyperglycemia will be alerted to the issue and referred 
to their diabetes care provider for follow-up (all patients will submit provider information to the 
study team at study start).  [CONTACT_113490] will join at least every other occurrence of these 
meetings (i.e., at least every 4 weeks) and provide a second review of [CONTACT_658084]’s medical 
management decisions. Participants will be trained in allowing their provider to access their 
CGM data. Mild hypoglycemia will not be exclusionary since such individuals are in high need 
of exercise intervention. Any day-to-day decisions about clinical care, including adjustment of 
insulin dosing or CGM target ranges will be made by [CONTACT_2299]’s provider, not the study 
physicians.  Clinical providers will not monitor CGM in real-time.
All participants participate in routine follow-up, consisting of quarterly visits to the clinic and 
24-hour access to nurse and/or physician consultation.  It is not anticipated that any of the 
data collection procedures or the intervention will cause any adverse effects.  Nonetheless, 
the participants will continue to receive routine medical and nursing care throughout the study 
period, and intervention for adverse effects will be available.   
These protocols have been utilized by [CONTACT_6283]. Ash, Weinzimer, and Nally over four prior exercise 
clinical trials among youth and adults with T1D that had no instances of severe hypoglycemia 
or diabetic ketoacidosis (HIC #s [PHONE_13614], [PHONE_13613], [PHONE_13615], [PHONE_13616]). 
Hyperglycemia: There is a risk of hyperglycemia due to exercise from factors such as 
counterregulatory hormone response releasing glucose into the blood26. 
See above regarding blood glucose testing, blood glucose monitoring review by [CONTACT_3647], 
Drs. Ash, Nally, Weinzimer, and routine clinical support.  Regarding hyperglycemia

Version #[ADDRESS_887180].  They will be advised in these instances to 
reassess their blood glucose. If blood glucose is greater than 270 mg/dL and not associated 
with a recent meal, they should check their blood for ketones and avoid exercise if they have 
ketones ≥1.0 mmol/L.  
Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia: There is a risk of severe hypoglycemia or 
hyperglycemia due to exercise. 
Severe hypoglycemia will be defined as any blood glucose level resulting in symptoms which 
require outside intervention to control (including but not limited to confusion and loss of 
coordination). Severe hyperglycemia will be defined as blood glucose >500mg/dL, presence 
of urine ketones or other signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (including but not limited 
to weakness and fatigue, confusion, shortness of breath). Patients will be asked to contact 
[CONTACT_658008]. Specifically, Yale-affiliated patients with T1D 
have access to a 24-hour hotline with access to nurse and/or physician advice or can choose 
to call 911. Non-Yale-affiliated patients will be asked to call [ADDRESS_887181] their providers’ 
after-hours staff (all patients will submit provider information to the study team at study start).  
The study team will be notified of the event within 24 hours via daily diaries; moreover all 
participants will have the PI’s direct contact [CONTACT_658009]. Our team will then notify the patient’s primary diabetes provider (if 
not already notified) and all study-related exercise will be suspended until patient receives 
further advice from their diabetes provider regarding next steps which may include modified 
exercise routines or suspension of the study altogether. All serious adverse events such as 
severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_657950] 24 hours of 
study staff being notified and to university’s IRB committee in writing within 5 business days. 
In the case of >1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_657951] 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_657952], the participant will be removed from the study and referred 
to their diabetes care provider for follow-up.
Exercise-related injuries: Exercise may cause muscle soreness/pain, muscle strain, 
cardiovascular events, and tiredness during or after the activity. 
The probability and magnitude of such injuries varies based upon factors such as the individual 
participant’s fitness level and the difficulty of the exercise routines. Our previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] 
(sect. 1.2) had no injuries or muscle strains. The American Heart Association Scientific 
Statement114 notes that the frequency of exercise-related out-of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657953] 35-90yr was measured at 3.[ADDRESS_887182] classes 
from the “beginner” category and “short” to “medium” duration (15-40 minutes). 
Though risk of serious injury is minimal, the research assistant will ask the participant weekly 
if they are having any of the symptoms overviewed on the consent form or any other injuries 
that could be made worse by [CONTACT_167765]. In the event of positive responses, exercise 
physiologist (EP) [CONTACT_642584] will contact [CONTACT_658010]-up questions, following protocols from 
the American College of Sports Medicine113, to determine if they are indicative of pathology. If 
they are, [CONTACT_642584] will report the epi[INVESTIGATOR_657954]. Stuart Weinzimer and the 
participant’s own PCP and suspend the participant’s exercise participation unless receiving 
PCP clearance to continue.

22Study questionnaires and interviews: Participants may experience some distress when 
discussing factors important to diabetes, diabetes management, and psychosocial stressors.
The probability of such responses is uncommon and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_657955]. No such instances were reported in our previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (sect. 1.2). 
Research participants who report negative psychological reactions to the research protocol, 
or negative emotional reactions to diabetes elicited during participation in the research 
study, will be referred to their regular clinical provider. If research staff determine that the 
degree of psychological reaction is severe, the physician staff of the study ([CONTACT_113490] or 
[CONTACT_658084]) will be contact[CONTACT_658011].
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): Participants will use Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved Dexcom G6 CGM as part of the American Diabetes Association standard of 
care70. There is a low risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of the sensor needle 
placement. Itchiness, redness, mild bleeding, and or bruising may occur at the insertion site. 
Participants may develop localized reactions to adhesive used to secure the sensor.
Risks of glucose sensor insertion will be minimized because participants will be instructed to 
cleanse skin aseptically prior to insertion. Participants will receive training on sensor use if 
they have not used the sensor previously.
Fitbit: In a very small number of participants (~3% in a recent report72) the Fitbit may 
contribute to skin irritation or allergies. To minimize this risk, participants will be trained in 
manufacturer guidelines including keepi[INVESTIGATOR_657956], not wearing it too tight (loose enough that it 
can move back and forth on the wrist, moved 2-[ADDRESS_887183] bone during 
exercise only), and giving the wrist a rest by [CONTACT_658012]. 
There are no potential social, cultural, financial, or legal risks to participants consenting to 
participate in this investigation.
Overall assessment: The risks associated with the current study are greater than minimal 
because exercise presents risk of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and injuries. However, the 
exercise routines are within the scope normally performed by [CONTACT_166038] T1D or other absolute 
insulin deficiency diabetes during daily living and the participants will benefit from our protocol 
measures described above that minimize exercise risks. In addition, the information to be 
gained will help develop an intervention supporting adults with T1D or other absolute insulin 
deficiency diabetes to become more physically active and overcome these risks of usual 
activity. Therefore, the value of the information to be gained outweighs the risks involved. 
2.3 Anticipated Benefits
All participants in this study will receive a mobile health application that may help them 
increase their exercise.  
Exercise is recommended by [CONTACT_658013] T1D due to 
its physical and mental health benefits.

benefits that outweigh their risks.  Furthermore, our participants will be supported in exercise 
safety by [CONTACT_658014] (blood glucose monitoring review by [CONTACT_6283]. Ash, Nally, 
Weinzimer, and routine clinical support) which further decreases the risk to benefit ratio. 
The skin irritation risks associated with wearing commercially-manufactured biosensor 
devices including the CGM and Fitbit in the context of the study are also the same as those 
from wearing these devices under normal conditions of daily living.  Wearing a CGM is 
recommended in the American Diabetes Association standard of care, and wearing a Fitbit 
device is a common and popular strategy to increase exercise. These benefits further 
decrease the risk to benefit ratio. 
There are standard risks of research including confidentiality breach, and distress when 
completing study questionnaires and interviews. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ash has 
determined in consultation with his mentors Drs. Weinzimer and Fucito that these are 
outweighed by [CONTACT_658015].

hazards will continue to appear with expected frequency (≥1 of the above patterns occurring 
in ≥80% of person-weeks). 
Hypothesis 1-3-3: The data will verify that small or greater (d≥0.1) changes in blood glucose 
resulting from exercise are detectable by a Bayesian model. 
SECONDARY 
Hypothesis 2-1-1: Fear of hypoglycemia and blood glucose trends over the past [ADDRESS_887185] momentary motivation states for physical activity (timepoints T1-T2). 
Hypothesis 2-1-2: Fear of hypoglycemia and glycemic metrics over the past week will predict 
motivation states for physical activity over the past week (timepoints T0-T2). 
Hypothesis 2-2-1: Motivation states for physical activity over the past week will predict physical 
activity behavior change and adherence over the 4-week intervention period (T0-T1). 
Hypothesis 2-2-2: Motivation states for physical activity over the past [ADDRESS_887186] 
physical activity maintenance, over the 2 weeks following the intervention (T1-T2).

emails, and social media advertisements (e.g., Facebook, Google, Instagram) will also be 
used, particularly targeting T1D support groups such as BeyondType1.org. Leaders of 
private groups will be contact[CONTACT_658023]. Study 
candidates identified on EPIC using the Joint Data and Analytics Team (JDAT) will receive a 
direct mailer, and those among them who have a MyChart account will receive a MyChart 
message.  Lastly, the study will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov and our departmental website.  
Images and text for these advertisements are given in appendices 14 and 15 respectively. 
Full layouts are given in Appendix 15a.
Interested individuals viewing these advertisements will be invited to inquire about the study 
by a) contact[CONTACT_658024], or b) 
providing their eligibility web questionnaire answers (Appendix 1b1) and contact [CONTACT_506178] 
a secure HIPAA-compliant Qualtrics webform (not capturing IP address or GPS location) so 
investigators may contact [CONTACT_658025]. These individuals (i.e., inquirers) will 
be provided a brief description of the study and invited to ask questions.  Among the 
inquirers, those wishing to volunteer will complete a brief eligibility interview (Appendix 1a, 
1b, 1c). If they meet criteria, their primary care provider (PCP) will be contact[CONTACT_658026] (Appendix 24). If eligible, the participant will be invited to schedule a 
consenting televideo visit on Zoom, which they will be asked to complete from as private a 
physical setting as possible. They will be emailed a pdf of the consent form the same day 
as screening, to review in advance of the consenting visit. Consent will be documented by

Consent/assent will use the standard IRB-approved compound consent / HIPAA 
research authorization form. 
A pdf of each IRB-approved form will be converted to an electronic survey on YCCI’s 
approved REDCap e-consent framework. The framework adds to REDCap’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_657957] (a) a final screen displaying all responses as a pdf that 
participants are asked to certify, (b) storage of the form as a pdf rather than 
exportable data fields, and (c) fields allowing for “wet” signatures (hand-traced using 
the mousepad).
The forms listed in the first bullet describe in detail the study intervention, study 
procedures, and risks. They are given to the participant and written electronic 
documentation of informed consent on these forms is required prior to starting study 
assessments and administering study intervention. Written electronic documentation 
on each form includes the signature [CONTACT_658083]/authorization form.
The participant will be asked to read and review the documents. The principal 
investigator, a co-investigator, or a research assistant will explain the research study 
to the participant (in terms suited to their comprehension) and answer any questions 
that may arise. This conversation will take place over a Zoom televideo call, which 
the participant will complete from as private a physical setting as possible.
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the electronic written forms 
and ask questions prior to signing. To identify and clarify any misconceptions, 
participants will be encouraged to describe the research procedures and their 
associated risks in their own words, followed by [CONTACT_658028]. A quiz is used to ensure understanding of study procedures. The 
participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate.
Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A pdf of the signed 
consent/assent documents will be sent by [CONTACT_658029].

6.1.1 Data Collection
STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW
The study is a single-group longitudinal study with periods of familiarization with devices, intervention using 
devices and mobile app, and maintenance follow-up (Figure 4). The primary aim is observing the intervention 
for feasibility, acceptability, and mathematical robustness. The secondary aim is observing psychological and 
biometric outcomes through assessments (Table 2) which are completed 1x/weekly during the entire study 
to test long-term effects (hypothesis 2-1-2 & 2-2-1) and 5x/daily during maintenance follow-up to test 
momentary effects (hypothesis 2-1-1 & 2-2-2). The secondary aim also includes an interview at the end of 
the study (hypothesis 2-3).

PROCEDURES FOR EACH VISIT ARE GIVEN BELOW:
VISIT 1 (Day 1)
On REDCap: consenting, medical history (verify from eligibility interview Appendix 1c), demographics form 
(Appendix 1d), contact [CONTACT_3031] (Appendix 1e). 
When possible, research staff will compare the collected medical and demographic information with EMR 
data accessed through EPIC (Yale patients) or Share Everywhere (non-Yale patients who have a MyChart 
account). In the event of any discrepancies, the staff will ask the participant for clarification to resolve the 
discrepancy.  
Monitor Symptoms
The research assistant will ask the participant if they are having any of the symptoms overviewed on the 
consent form or any other injuries that could be made worse by [CONTACT_167765]. In the event of positive 
responses, exercise physiologist (EP) [CONTACT_642584] will contact [CONTACT_658010]-up questions, following 
protocols from the American College of Sports Medicine113, to determine if they are indicative of pathology. 
If they are, [CONTACT_642584] will report the epi[INVESTIGATOR_657954]. Stuart Weinzimer and the participant’s 
own PCP and suspend the participant’s exercise participation unless receiving PCP clearance to continue.
Mailing
After visit 1, participants will be mailed a package containing:
a. Blood pressure monitor (Omron BP760N)
b. CGM transmitter plus 6 sensors (Dexcom G6). If not already using. Issued by [CONTACT_658032] a research 
contract, not involving a prescription.
c. Bluetooth ketone meter and test strips (Keto-Mojo GK+). The device also acts as a glucometer for CGM 
calibrations and sensor changes.
d. Prepackaged snacks containing 15g fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., Nestle Juicy Juice 125mL boxes, 
Glucose Tablets)
e. Fitness smartwatch (Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 3)
f. Bluetooth Smart Insulin Pen (Companion Medical Inpen). If not a pump user. Issued by [CONTACT_658033] 
a research contract, not involving a prescription. A prescription for the participant’s normal insulin in the 
correct cartridge for the InPen (3mL, U-100) will be obtained from the participant’s primary diabetes care 
provider, or sent by a study physician through EPIC.
g. Smartphone. If not already owned

allowed to continue with other aspects of the study. For example, if they lose the smartwatch they can still 
use the exercise app with feedback missing the heart rate, steps, and sleep. Or if they lose the scale, they 
can still attend the weekly visits and complete the surveys and blood pressure readings. Participants will not 
be responsible for the cost of any lost or damaged items.
VISIT 2 (Day 8)
Devices
Participants not currently using a Dexcom G6 CGM will be trained over tele-video by [CONTACT_658034] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ash. The training protocol incorporates information from the manufacturer setup 
protocol plus additional guidance provided by [CONTACT_658035]. Weinzimer and Nally (Appendix 
21). Participants will log into either their own Dexcom account (current users) or an anonymous account set 
up by [CONTACT_9872] a generic username, generic email address, and password (new users) and pair the 
device. They will be guided to create a “share code” that gives the holder access to CGM data in real-time; 
research staff will record the code on Yale’s secure server for transmission to their primary diabetes care 
provider. The CGM is validated against venous blood glucose (mean absolute percentage error 9%-10%86,91). 
For the 2-week familiarization period until visit 4, the trainer will review CGM data after days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 
[ADDRESS_887192] sensor 
change (day 10) was completed as scheduled). The trainer will also talk with the participant at each weekly 
visit and query if there are any issues with skin irritation, sensor dislodgement, or values suspi[INVESTIGATOR_657958]. At the visit 2 weeks after initiation (visit 4), they will ask if there were any 
issues with the first sensor change. Trainer will follow up with participant to troubleshoot as needed. We will 
start with a bank of standard troubleshooting techniques from our procedure manual, then involve Dexcom 
customer service or a senior clinician from the research team as needed. 
Participants will set up the Fitbit Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1312] 3 to track steps (typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] ~5% overestimation)92,93 and heart rate 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] ~3% underestimation)92. It will arrive to participants linked to an account set up by [CONTACT_9872] 
a generic username, generic email address, and password. Participants will be guided to place it on their 
non-dominant wrist and taught to mark exercise start-stop times using the side button, advised that marked 
bouts will have logged timing on the dashboard but all bouts are counted toward daily totals. Fitbit non-wear 
is defined as ≥[ADDRESS_887193] 22 hours per day and charge it for 2 hours when the battery is low (expected every 5-7 days). 
Participants will set up the Keto-Mojo GK+ which uses fingerstick strips to track blood ketones and blood 
glucose, the latter replacing CGM values when needed (i.e., during CGM calibrations and sensor changes). 
It will arrive to participants linked to an account set up by [CONTACT_9872] a generic username, generic 
email address, and password. Participants will receive a demonstration with explanation that it works like a 
standard glucometer, with blue strips testing ketones and brown strips testing glucose. 
Participants will set up the insulin smartpen (Companion Medical InPen), over tele-video with training guided 
by [CONTACT_658036] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ash (Appendix 23). It will arrive to participants linked to an 
account set up by [CONTACT_9872] a generic username, generic email address, and password. The account 
will be disabled for all features and alerts that guide insulin dosing and timing. The trainer will review the 
participant’s use of their normal insulin pen, ensure they use it correctly, then orient them to the parts of the 
InPen so they can use it the same way as their normal pen. The trainer will also note that the InPen is reusable 
and train the participant to change cartridges. Patients already owning the device will be asked to use their 
own, or otherwise one will be provided by [CONTACT_5051]. Patients who administer insulin in their usual 
care by a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump rather than multiple daily injections will continue using their

techniques from our procedure manual, then involve Medtronic customer service or a senior clinician from 
the research team as needed.
Participants will set up the Actigraph GT9X hip accelerometer (i.e., blinded hip and wrist watch) on their own 
belt, elastic waistband, or a belt we provide. They are asked to wear the device on the hip for all waking hours 
except bathing, and on the dominant wrist (i.e., opposite wrist of the Fitbit) for sleep. The device samples 
data at 30Hz and aggregates it into 60-second epochs. Non-wear periods are defined by [CONTACT_658037]’s algorithm94 
confirmed against participant logs of non-wear periods; previously our wear time exceeded literature 
standards (14.1±1.9 waking hours per day for 5.4±1.0 out of 7 days)58. Participants will receive a daily 
morning SMS survey through Ilumivu or Qualtrics asking them to log that morning’s attachment time and 
previous night’s removal time.
Participants will measure blood pressure by [CONTACT_658038]95. We will take the 
average of 2 brachial artery measurements after ≥12 hours abstention from acute blood pressure 
confounders (exercise, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, nicotine) and ≥[ADDRESS_887195] using the Omron 
BP760N, which includes a rigid cuff that minimizes fitting errors. If the measurements differ by >[ADDRESS_887196] two will be averaged. In the event of a result meeting the home BP 
monitoring criteria for uncontrolled accelerated hypertension (systolic >160 mmHg and/or diastolic >100 
mmHg), the participant will be withheld from exercise participation until BP can be reassessed at least one 
day later. In the event of a second occasion meeting these values, the participant will be removed from the 
study and referred to their healthcare provider for follow-up. 
Daily morning survey that captures daily morning context during app intervention is started at this 
visit -- Appendix 8a: 1) prior day hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; 2) recent clinical events (asked every day for 2 
weeks, then every 2 weeks); 3) fear of hypoglycemia previous night and coming day; 4) sleep quality and 
nocturia previous night; 5) competing demands and exercise plan for the day.
Surveys
Participants will complete the first weekly “long-term” survey (Table 2, third column) on REDCap. 
Communication to primary diabetes provider

Start of Intervention
Participants will download and be oriented to use the GlucoseZone™ (New Haven, CT) mobile application 
that delivers the digital intervention. The intervention is designed to target [ADDRESS_887197] with recommendations70,71. Participants utilize exercise videos with biometrically-driven feedback 
coaching.
Data Captured by [CONTACT_658041] -- Appendix 8a: 1) prior day hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; 2) recent clinical events 
(asked every 2 weeks only); 3) fear of hypoglycemia previous night and coming day; 4) sleep quality and 
nocturia previous night; 5) competing demands and exercise plan for the day.
Pre- and mid-exercise context captured in conjunction with videos – Appendix 8b & 8c and passive 
data from app and sensors: 1) carbohydrates taken; 2) insulin dosing; 3) weather; 4) day of the week; 5) 
exercise instructional video selected; 6) exercise performance metrics.
24hr passive data from sensors – 1) Continuous blood glucose; 2) Physical activity outside of exercise 
videos 
The app uses this biometric data to give exercise guidance, as described in the funded grant submission 
(1K01DK129441) and below
Tool #1: Access to a library of 200 exercise videos following brief human orientation consultation 
(Appendix 18b). Our ~200 exercise videos (GlucoseZone™, New Haven, CT) include a combination of 
aerobic, resistance, flexibility, and balance exercises, in accord with American Diabetes Association 
recommendations70,71.  They can be filtered by [CONTACT_658042], duration, type of exercise (aerobic vs. 
resistance), muscle groups, mobility limitations (knee-friendly, shoulder-friendly, chair-based), 
indoor/outdoor, and home equipment availability.  Using these filters, participants can select single sessions 
or 30-session series that progress in difficulty and duration. Participants self-schedule exercise time in their 
home environment or outdoor guided walking routes. Participants may select routines requiring no 
equipment, use a $[ADDRESS_887198] (EP) from the research team ([CONTACT_642584],) will guide

analysis (Sect 7.2.1, hypothesis 2-3). A consultant from the manufacturer of GlucoseZone (Fitscript LLC; [CONTACT_658085] O’Connell or Ms. LaurieAnn Scher) will be available for assistance with downloading, navigating, or 
troubleshooting the app.

42Tool #2: Daily just-in-time adaptive text messages to overcome exercise barriers on vulnerable days. 
Just-in-time adaptive messaging is “an intervention that adapts the provision of support (e.g., the type, timing, 
intensity) over time to an individual’s changing status and contexts with the goal to deliver support “at the 
moment and in the context that the person needs it most and is most likely to be receptive.”2 From “data 
captured by [CONTACT_97458]” (above, Appendix 8) the app will extract data to generate just-in-time adaptive messages. 
Specifically, the app organizes these data on a dashboard accessible to Yale staff. When a Yale staff member 
monitors this dashboard daily for exercise safety as described in the DSMP (Sect 8.7, “tracking”) they export 
the contents onto the Yale Secure Server and enter them into our machine-learning code using Python to 
generate a supportive message (or confirmation that no message is needed that day). The staff member 
relays this information to the EP [CONTACT_642584] who edits the message as needed according to standard of care 
T1D exercise guidelines26,70,71 then sends the message to the participant through the GlucoseZone app.
The exported data include firstly exercise adherence, by [CONTACT_658043] (videos 
or guided outdoor walking). Fitbit heart rate readings verify exercise timing, duration, and intensity. The Borg 
Rating of Perceived Exertion prompt captures intensity for non-aerobic exercises such as weightlifting 
(Appendix 8c). The extracted data also include contextual variables that may predict vulnerability to missing 
exercise: 1) 24hr blood glucose derived from interstitial vales sampled every 5min by [CONTACT_658044] (coefficient of variation, mean, % time >180, 70-180, <70mg/dL)60. 2) Fear of 
hypoglycemia the previous night and coming day (Appendix 8a). 3) Sleep Quality the previous night from 
self-report (Appendix 8a) and Fitbit (sleep time overestimation ~10%)96; 4) Competing demands and exercise 
plan (Appendix 8a); 5) Weather; (temperature, humidity, windchill) captured using GPS location and the 
National Weather Service API; 6) Day of the week (weekday vs. weekend). 7) Insulin dosing (including 
entered carbohydrates) from the participant’s device (InPen, Tandem, Omnipod, or Medtronic). 8) Physical 
activity outside of exercise videos; captured by [CONTACT_658045] (intensity classification 
accuracy 85%97, step counts ±3%92;).
The above markers of individual context, day of the week, and between-participant characteristics, 
including demographics and clinical characteristics that can impede exercise (body composition, mobility 
limitations), will be exported from GlucoseZone to our Yale Secure Server for processing by [CONTACT_658046]-
learning code. The code is programmed to identify predictors of exercise “lapse,” defined as the 3rd missed 
day of the week or 2nd consecutive missed day given that the goal is 150 min/week spread over ≥[ADDRESS_887199]-in-time message meeting its occurrence would read: “Sometimes blood 
glucose can go up and down. You can still be active using the strategies you and your provider have 
discussed.” This encouragement does not extend to suggestions of specific exercises or managing low blood 
glucose.
The mathematical basis of the code is a binary classification model of exercise lapse using Python 
scikit-learn package v. 0.19.098, including random forests and gradient boosted tree ensembles (such as 
XgBoost99). We have completed analyses that train the model at the group level which was aim 2 of our prior 
protocol (HIC #[PHONE_13613]). Briefly, we collected data on blood glucose, insulin dosing, fear of 
hypoglycemia, sleep, illness, and exercise occurrence. We ran two types of machine learning – random forest 
and dense neural network -- to predict exercise lapses (i.e., days without exercise) based upon prior days’ 
blood glucose, fear of hypoglycemia, sleep, and illness. The data were randomly split where 80% of person-
days were used to train the model and the other 20% were used to test the model. The present study will use 
the random forest model which had the highest accuracy (79%). Its sensitivity to predict exercise lapses was 
83% and specificity was 71%. A confidential draft of the full manuscript describing the development is 
included (Appendix 20). These accuracy metrics, while limited, are better than the non-AI alternative of 
sending an encouraging message every day without any attempt to select for the most vulnerable days. 
Doing so can lead the participants to develop alarm fatigue and silence the notifications. 
These models have been pruned to reduce the complexity of the final classifiers and avoid overfitting 
the training data. This group-level model (Appendix 9a) will be the starting point for training a person-level 
model for each participant via supervised transfer learning methods during the present study to give the 
participant tailored prompts. This strategy mitigates the shortness of the timeframe (4 weeks) to train each

pi[CONTACT_158793]-level model. Second, they will be combined with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a larger sample size to assess 
potential covariates, including pump vs. injection users, prior CGM usage, and age. If needed, separate 
models for subgroups can be established in the subsequent beta version of the app. Models are evaluated 
by [CONTACT_658047]-level models to reach acceptable accuracy (receiver-
operator characteristic AUC .80, or precision-recall AUC .80 if <20% of days are lapses), thus estimating a 
“learning window” before users can expect adaptive feedback. We can anticipate this learning window by 
[CONTACT_658048] a simplified algorithm (e.g., chosen from a bank according to an a priori 
hierarchy of barriers present) until adaptive feedback starts. For instance, the example at the end of the 
previous paragraph would be utilized based on the detection of high blood glucose variability, even if the 
model has not yet established high blood glucose variability as a vulnerable state predictor. 
The messages will go through expert human review and edits by [CONTACT_658049]. Differences between the algorithm-generated and human-edited messages will be 
tabulated for analysis at the end of the study (Sect 7.2, Hypothesis 1-3-1). 
Tool #3: Personalized review of safety hazard occurrences around exercise and tips to avoid them. 
The GlucoseZone cloud will apply heuristic codes to the exercise and CGM data to recognize common 
patterns that contribute to glycemic regulation (Table 3). These patterns were selected using a list in 
international consensus guidelines for the entire T1D population26 pared down to ones observed occurring in 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The GlucoseZone cloud will send participants weekly reports to summarize their patterns, 
corresponding follow-up tips, daily CGM tracings with indicated exercise times, and weekly summary 
statistics. The above patterns may occur less commonly than expected (≥1 of the above patterns occurring 
in ≥80% of person-weeks) or differ in occurrence by [CONTACT_658050]. injection users, 
prior CGM usage, and age. In that case, we will examine the data for other more commonly occurring patterns 
to include in this tool in the next version. CGM tracking of people with T1D in the earliest stages of exercise 
uptake is novel, so some new patterns are expected.

44Tool #4: Health outcome feedback regarding the causal impact of exercise upon blood glucose 
(Appendix 18). The GlucoseZone cloud will draw CGM metrics (coefficient of variation, mean, % time >180, 
70-180, <70mg/dL)60 and covariates (insulin-on-board, carbohydrates self-reported into insulin device, 
exercise metrics including video selected and Fitbit minutes / heart rate / distance / calories / sleep / activity 
at sub-exercise intensity). The app organizes these data on a dashboard accessible to Yale staff. A Yale staff 
member exports the contents onto the Yale Secure Server weekly and enters them into our Bayesian R-code 
(Appendix 9b)100. The EP reviews the results and accompanying visualizations documenting a positive, 
neutral, or negative effect of exercise  once per 1-[ADDRESS_887200] representative results and/or visualizations and any 
recommended adjustments by [CONTACT_658051]26,70,71 (e.g., “You have done 
purely resistance exercise for the past [ADDRESS_887201] of increasing blood glucose 
time above target range. Consider more aerobic exercise.”)  If these EP’s recommendations indicate 
repeating certain videos, they will accordingly appear on the home-screen the following week.
The mathematical basis of the R-code is our Bayesian time series model. Briefly, it compares CGM 
metrics over each 1-[ADDRESS_887202] a counterfactual predicted based upon the CGM during the 1-4 
weeks before the period and the covariates over the 1-4 week period. The full formalism and an example of 
this analysis is available in our manuscript100. The advantage over linear modeling frameworks is the flexibility 
to evaluate the intervention’s effect strength at all points in the intervention period. If p-values do not reach 
significance (α=.05) then the next version of the app will extend the length of the testing window before 
providing feedback, though even 1 week of CGM data at minimal adherence (70%) yields k=1,411 
observations resulting in 96% power to detect a small effect size (d≥0.10) at α=.05. The maximum window

to reach out. B, If your blood sugar is high (more than 270 mg/dL) before starting exercise, check your blood or urine for ketones. 
If you test positive for ketones, avoid vigorous activity.  If you do not have ketones in your blood or urine and you feel well, it 
should be fine to exercise.

use and degree of technical support needed, α=.91) for each of the above tools and each biosensor, Likert-
style survey items specially designed for each of the novel mobile tools based upon the above questions, net

7.2 Planned Analyses
Primary Objective 1 (DESCRIPTIVE). Evaluate the intervention for feasibility
Hypothesis 1-1. Participant use metrics (i.e., % completion of diary, % wear-time of 
biosensors, frequency of video usage, % received of text messages) will be summarized

Primary Objective 2 (DESCRIPTIVE). Evaluate the intervention for acceptability (i.e., user 
satisfaction)
Hypothesis 1-2. Results of acceptability survey will be summarized with descriptive 
measures. Weekly interviews about app usage will be transcribed, reviewed, and analyzed

Primary Objective 3 (MACHINE LEARNING). Evaluate the mathematical robustness of the 
intervention by [CONTACT_658060], assess exercise 
safety hazards, and measure exercise glycemic response.
Hypothesis 1-3-1. Predicting Exercise Behavior. The mathematical basis of the code is a 
binary classification model of exercise lapse using Python scikit-learn package v. 0.19.098, 
including random forests and gradient boosted tree ensembles (such as XgBoost99). We have 
completed analyses that train the model at the group level using the previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_657969] 
(section 1.2.3). These models have been pruned to reduce the complexity of the final 
classifiers and avoid overfitting the training data. This group-level model (Appendix 9a) will be 
the starting point for training a person-level model for each participant via supervised transfer 
learning methods during the present study to give the participant tailored prompts. This 
strategy mitigates the shortness of the timeframe (4 weeks) to train each person’s model. At 
the end of the study, the data will first be used as an independent sample to validate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_657970]-level model. Second, they will be combined with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a larger sample size

Hypothesis 2-1-2. Week-to-week changes in motivation states. We will develop two 
generalized linear mixed models for the dependent variables of want and aversion for physical 
activity (CRAVE 10-item “right now”) respectively. A random intercept will incorporate 
correlations within-subject. We will include long-term assessed independent variables and

Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in confidence by [CONTACT_324062], their staff, and the sponsor(s)/funding agency. Therefore, the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. 
While there is a possibility of a security breach compromising subject confidentiality, several 
steps will be taken to safeguard the confidentiality of subjects and their data as detailed 
below.  
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.
All research data collected outside of the mobile applications will be assigned a study 
participant number and that number will only identify participants in digital databases on 
REDCap or Actigraph Actilife.  Audio-recorded interviews and orientation sessions will be 
transcribed and names, places, and any other identifying information will be removed. 
Recordings will then be promptly destroyed. The names of participants will not be associated 
with these data and assessments and transcriptions will be maintained according to participant 
study number. A master list connecting participant study numbers to participant names will be 
kept on a secure server where it can only be accessed by [CONTACT_528696].  Any 
information published as a result of the study will be such that it will not permit identification of 
any participant. 
All research data that is collected via the mobile applications (CGM, diary responses, exercise 
performance, insulin usage, carbohydrates, GPS) will be stored on the relevant web 
application programming interface (API) platforms (Dexcom, Fitbit, GlucoseZone), researcher 
dashboard (Keto-Mojo, Ilumivu, Qualtrics), or user dashboard (InPen) in accord with Yale 
Information Technology Services protocols (Sect 2.2, Table A1).  After syncing the data, the 
data will be immediately deleted from the participants’ biosensor devices and smartphones.  
Web-based application and user sessions are encrypted between the server and client

598.7 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
I. OVERVIEW
This clinical study is a feasibility study of the alpha version of an informatics-based digital 
application to promote safe exercise.
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) outlined below for the study will adhere to the 
protocol approved by [CONTACT_658065].
II. ADVERSE EVENTS
A.Adverse event assessment
The expected risks of this protocol are:
Confidentiality: Due to the collection of private identifiable information, there is a possibility 
of a security breach compromising subject confidentiality.
Hypoglycemia: There is risk of hypoglycemia due to exercise.
Hyperglycemia: There is a risk of hyperglycemia due to exercise. Hyperglycemia can lead 
to diabetic ketoacidosis.
Exercise-related injuries: Exercise may cause muscle soreness/pain, muscle strain, 
cardiovascular events, and tiredness during or after the activity. 
Study questionnaires and interviews: Participants may experience some distress when 
discussing factors important to diabetes, diabetes management, and psychosocial stressors.
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): Participants will use Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approved Dexcom G6 CGM as part of the American Diabetes Association standard of 
care70. There is a low risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of the sensor needle 
placement. Itchiness, redness, mild bleeding, and or bruising may occur at the insertion site. 
Participants may develop localized reactions to adhesive used to secure the sensor.
Fitbit: In a very small number of participants (~3% in a recent report72) the Fitbit may 
contribute to skin irritation or allergies. 
The approved protocol and consent form will address these risks.

health risks associated with exercise:
We will detect any diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia within 24hr and suspend 
exercise until a personalized preventive strategy can be formed. To achieve this level of 
monitoring, a research assistant will monitor daily the biometric dashboard which contains 
Bluetooth-captured glucose, ketones, and exercise start/stop times. Safety signals include any 
of the following during or within 1hr of exercise: 1) Diabetic ketoacidosis (glucose ≥270 mg/dL 
+ ketones ≥1.0 mmol/L), 2) Possible diabetic ketoacidosis (glucose ≥270 mg/dL and failure to 
test ketones), and 3) Possible severe hypoglycemia (glucose <55 mg/dL). Research staff will 
respond to each of these events within 24hr of its occurrence by [CONTACT_658066] (app account will be suspended) until the 
participant has been contact[CONTACT_426] a study physician. The physician will alert the participant 
and the participant’s primary diabetes care provider to the issue and develop a prevention 
strategy, consulting with the primary diabetes care provider as needed. The exercise 
suspension will then be lifted, unless the participant has met the protocol’s stoppage criteria 
(>1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_66677], 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_657974]). 
      In the event of the “possible” occurrences (#2, #3), physician contact [CONTACT_658067]. Then, if possible diabetic 
ketoacidosis is supported by [CONTACT_658068], or possible severe 
hypoglycemia is supported by [CONTACT_658069]/or physical status 
requiring assistance from another person for recovery, physician contact [CONTACT_658070] #[ADDRESS_887222] any other exercise-associated health risks within 24-36hr and suspend 
exercise until a personalized preventive strategy can be formed. To achieve this level of 
monitoring, the morning survey question about prior day’s clinical events (Appendix 8a, last 
question) will be asked of participants and monitored by [CONTACT_658071]. If the participant 
reports a clinical event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_657975] (c.f. Protocol 
Sect 6.3) the same day (i.e., within 24-36hr of the reported event). If the event may be 
exercise-related, the participant will be informed to immediately suspend the exercise program 
(app account will be suspended) until the participant has been contact[CONTACT_426] a study physician. 
The physician will alert the participant to the issue and develop a prevention strategy, 
consulting with the participant’s primary diabetes care provider as needed. The exercise 
suspension will then be lifted, unless the participant has met the protocol’s stoppage criteria.
B. Biweekly monitoring for mild hypo- or hyperglycemia:

with elevated glucose values (Table 3, Sect 6.1.1). Safety issues will be noted and 
communicated to participant. Participant will be referred to their diabetes care provider if 
insulin dose adjustments are needed. The data will secondly be reviewed for adverse events.  
The study timetable has been set so that no more than 11 participants are active at one time, 
making this auditing manageable.  Adverse events will be defined as severe hypoglycemia

of causality. [CONTACT_113490] will join at least every other occurrence of these meetings (i.e., at

decisions. [CONTACT_113490] is a world expert in CGM for T1D glycemic management in adult 
patients 18-25 years old, whose glycemic patterns are similar to those 30-65 years old. As a 
preeminent CGM authority he frequently advises adult endocrinologists on CGM issues. 
Regarding non-glycemic medical issues related to older age (e.g., angina history), [CONTACT_658088], an adult endocrinologist at the University of Maryland and previous collaborator of 
[CONTACT_642584] ([CONTACT_642584]’s manuscripts58,[ADDRESS_887224]. Spanakis’ own clinical trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), will

viewing and commenting. 
C. Weekly monitoring for elevated blood pressure (BP) and symptoms
The protocol also includes tracking of blood pressure (BP) so that participants developi[INVESTIGATOR_657976]-up. Weekly tracking protocols are based upon [CONTACT_642584]’s dissertation65 and a prior 
exercise clinical trial conducted in the same laboratory111 overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Paul Thompson, 
Chief of Cardiology, Hartford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. In those trials, participants with pre- to stage 1 
hypertension safely performed moderate to maximal exercise. Those trials utilized office BP 
criteria of uncontrolled accelerated hypertension (systolic > 160 mmHg and/or diastolic >100 
mmHg) for study exclusion which are cutoffs where consensus guidelines recommend more 
careful monitoring95. We will use these cutoffs. The specific procedures are below:
BP will be checked by [CONTACT_658072] (visits 2-10) by [CONTACT_658073]95. Briefly, we will take the average of 2 brachial artery measurements 
after ≥12 hours abstention from acute blood pressure confounders (exercise, caffeine, alcohol, 
tobacco, nicotine) and ≥[ADDRESS_887225] using the Omron BP7350 (Omron Healthcare), 
which includes a rigid cuff that minimizes fitting errors. If the measurements differ by >[ADDRESS_887226] two will be averaged. In the event of a result meeting 
the home BP monitoring criteria for uncontrolled accelerated hypertension (systolic >145 
mmHg and/or diastolic >90 mmHg), the result will be faxed to the participants’ primary diabetes 
healthcare provider as a possible early indicator of true uncontrolled accelerated hypertension. 
In the event of a result meeting uncontrolled accelerated hypertension (systolic >160 mmHg 
and/or diastolic >90 mmHg) the participant will be withheld from exercise participation until BP 
can be reassessed at least one day later. In the event of a second occasion meeting these 
values, the participant will be removed from the study and referred to their healthcare provider 
for follow-up. 
The research assistant will ask the participant if they are having any of the symptoms 
overviewed on the consent form or any other injuries that could be made worse by [CONTACT_167765]. 
In the event of positive responses, exercise physiologist (EP) [CONTACT_642584] will contact [CONTACT_658074]-up questions, following protocols from the American College of Sports Medicine113, to 
determine if they are indicative of pathology. If they are, [CONTACT_642584] will report the epi[INVESTIGATOR_657977]. Stuart Weinzimer and the participant’s own PCP and suspend the 
participant’s exercise participation unless receiving PCP clearance to continue. For complaints 
that are musculoskeletal issues that can be temporarily avoided by [CONTACT_658075]. Ash 
recommending GlucoseZone videos that avoid the injured area, then such videos can be 
continued without PCP clearance.
Steps to Minimize
Among enrolled subjects, steps will be taken to minimize risks of hypoglycemia and 
hyperglycemia as detailed in section 2.2, “Protection against Risks”. Briefly, these include

Version #[ADDRESS_887227]. Nally’s medical management decisions by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Weinzimer at least every 4 weeks, 
and routine clinical support. Regarding non-glycemic medical issues related to older age (e.g., 
angina history), [CONTACT_658089] will be available for consultations.
Participants will be instructed to call the Yale 24-hour access to nurse and/or physician 
consultation or [ADDRESS_887228] 
with their provider who will then determine the next steps regarding resumption of exercise 
and ongoing mobile application usage.  Any day-to-day decisions about clinical care including 
adjustment of insulin doses or CGM target ranges will be made by [CONTACT_2299]’s provider, 
not the study physicians.  
These protocols have been utilized by [CONTACT_6283]. Ash, Weinzimer, and Nally over four prior 
exercise clinical trials among youth and adults with T1D that had no instances of severe 
hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (HIC #s [PHONE_13614], [PHONE_13613], [PHONE_13615], 
[PHONE_13616]).
Exercise-related injuries: 
To minimize adverse events during exercise we will exclude patients who have chronic 
disease or physical disability that would influence treatment intervention or preclude 
participation in regular exercise. Information to make this determination will be collected by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ash administering the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, a consensus instrument 
endorsed by [CONTACT_658076]112. This information is then processed in three steps. First, individuals 
meeting any of the following conditions will be excluded: diabetic ketoacidosis not clearly 
related to pump site failure in past 6 months, >[ADDRESS_887229] 6 
months, home blood pressure >160 mmHg systolic or >100 mmHg diastolic, chronic renal 
failure, pregnancy, cognitive impairment, inability to read and/or understand English, severe 
retinopathy, neuropathy or nephropathy, history of uncontrolled arrhythmia (e.g., Afib with 
RVR, new onset Afib, ventricular tachycardia, escape rhythms), congestive heart failure (stage 
3 or 4), exercise-induced asthma (not controlled on inhalers), chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (requiring home oxygen), myocardial infarction and (or) angina in the past 12 months.  
Second, one of the study physicians Drs. Weinzimer or Nally will review any positive 
responses from the questionnaire not listed in the previous sentence. If they determine any of 
the positive responses would influence treatment intervention or preclude participation in 
regular exercise (e.g., recent spi[INVESTIGATOR_61691]), that individual will also be excluded. Third, the 
individual’s primary care provider (PCP) will be contact[CONTACT_658077] (Appendix 24).  
Individuals passing this screening will be considered medically cleared to enroll, although [CONTACT_658090] or Nally or the individual’s own PCP can revoke clearance at any time during the 
study, for example if the patient has a change in clinical status and/or a response to exercise 
that EP [CONTACT_642584], [CONTACT_113490] or Dr, Nally determines warrants a stoppage of usage of the 
mobile application.  At any stage of this process, [CONTACT_658089] will be available for Drs. Ash, 
Weinzimer or Nally to consult on medical issues related to older age (e.g., angina history).  
Also to minimize the risk of injuries or strains, participants will complete the GlucoseZone 
videos warm-up and cool-down routines. In addition, they will be coached to initially select

Though risk of serious injury is minimal, if pain persists or prevents daily activities, participants 
will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_263235].
In addition, symptoms and blood pressure are monitored and evaluated weekly (see above 
“Tracking”, section C).
Study Questionnaires and Interviews
Research participants who report negative psychological reactions to the research protocol, 
or negative emotional reactions to diabetes elicited during participation in the research study, 
will be referred to their regular clinical provider. If research staff determine that the degree of 
psychological reaction is severe, the physician staff of the study ([CONTACT_113490] or [CONTACT_658084]) 
will be contact[CONTACT_658078].
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
Risks of glucose sensor insertion will be minimized because participants will be instructed to 
cleanse skin aseptically prior to insertion. Participants will receive training on sensor use if 
they have not used the sensor previously.
Fitbit 
In a very small number of participants (~3% in a recent report72) the Fitbit may contribute to 
skin irritation or allergies. To minimize this risk, participants will be trained in manufacturer 
guidelines including keepi[INVESTIGATOR_657956], not wearing it too tight (loose enough that it can move back 
and forth on the wrist, moved 2-[ADDRESS_887230] bone during exercise only), and 
giving the wrist a rest by [CONTACT_658079].

64Events that may require a temporary or permanent interruption of study activities by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_657962] (if possible) with a written report filed within 5 calendar days.  
Reportable Events (which are events that are serious or life-threatening and unanticipated (or 
anticipated but occurring with a greater frequency than expected) and possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to study procedures) will be filed as a written report within 5 calendar days. 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) will be filed as a 
written report within 5 calendar days. UPI[INVESTIGATOR_657963]: 
• Adverse device effects from any of the biosensors (continuous glucose monitor, smartwatch, 
insulin smartpen, hip accelerometer), since no adverse effects are expected from any of the 
devices used in the study. 
• Adverse events or injuries that are serious, unexpected, and related; 
• Breaches of confidentiality involving risks; 
• Interim analyses altering the risk/benefit profile by [CONTACT_658057];
• Revisions to safety information, such as MedWatch Reports, that meet the definition of a 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]; 
• New information indicating an unexpected increase in risks or decrease in potential benefits 
(e.g., literature/scientific reports or other published findings); 
• Protocol deviations, violations, or other accidental or unintentional changes to the protocol 
or procedures involving risks or with the potential to recur; 
• Unapproved changes made to the research to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to a 
subject; 
• Other problem or finding (e.g., loss of study data or forms) that an investigator or research 
staff member believes could influence the safe conduct of the research.
Events that do not require prompt reporting and are only documented at regular reports (twice 
yearly to DSMB, annual renewals to the Yale IRB, and annual progress reports to NIDDK) are:  
• Anticipated adverse events (described in Section II-A)
• Adverse device effects that are non-serious, anticipated, or unrelated; 
• Adverse events or injuries that are non-serious, expected, or unrelated; 
• Deaths not attributed to the research (e.g., from “natural causes,” accidents, or underlying 
disease when the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_657964]’s death); 
• Interim analyses not altering the risk/benefit profile; 
• Protocol deviations or violations unlikely to recur or not involving risks to subjects; 
• Subject complaints that were resolved or complaints not involving risks
• Problems or findings not involving risk (unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_657965]’ willingness to continue in the research)
Any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of this study (e.g., IRB actions, 
or actions by [CONTACT_473]) will be immediately reported to the appropriate NIDDK program 
official.

65Oversight of participant safety includes review of adverse events as well as study 
progress, data integrity and study outcomes.
A.Justification of sample size
As described in section 7.2:
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_657979], for which a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_657980] 10-[ADDRESS_887231] 
ensure thematic saturation of interviews (aims 1-2, 2-3), and second achieve adequate 
power for one of the secondary objectives, specifically hypothesis 2-1-1. Based on my past 
retention and adherence among sedentary adults with and without T1D (88% participants 
completed, they provided 83% of ecological momentary assessments on longer surveys 
than the present study, 90% continuous glucose monitor wear, and 95% accelerometer 
wear)58,[ADDRESS_887232] wants and aversions (.28/.39 ICC, 
9.9/12.3 total variances)[ADDRESS_887233] design effects of 14.21/20.[ADDRESS_887234] errors of 
0.37/0.48, yielding 91%/81% power to detect predictors having ≥ .34 correlation (e.g., 
pleasure52, fear of hypoglycemia42). For other secondary objective hypotheses (2-1-2, 2-2-1, 
2-2-2) the study is not designed to detect statistical significance but calculate effect sizes 
(Cohen’s f2) for purposes of determining whether the WANT48-52, SCT model54-56, or both 
generate a signal for prediction of physical activity behavior.
B.Safety and study progress reviews
[CONTACT_642584] will have primary responsibility for ongoing monitoring of adverse events and 
submitting reports according to the timetables in section II-B to the study physicians Drs. Nally 
and Weinzimer, the DSMB, the Yale University IRB, and the NIDDK program.  The DSMB will 
review all adverse events and make recommendations.  [CONTACT_642584] will notify NIDDK of IRB-
approved revisions to the study protocol that indicate a change in risk entity as appropriate 
and (if applicable) the action plan for the response, as well as notice of any actions taken by 
[CONTACT_437503].
[CONTACT_642584] and the DSMB will review reports of safety as they are made according to the 
timetables in section II-B; thus, serious events will be reviewed within [ADDRESS_887235]. Ash will review study progress every 3 months.  This will include recruitment (number of 
participants approached, number eligible, number enrolled, reasons for ineligibility and non-
enrollment), retention (percentage of participants completing baseline and follow-up 
assessments, reasons for dropouts), and adherence (biosensor wear time, percentage of daily 
mobile diaries completed).  
[CONTACT_642584] will hold a research meeting every [ADDRESS_887236]. Weinzimer’s research nurses and coordinators involved with the study to review the status 
of all enrolled participants and discuss the eligibility of potential participants. At this biweekly

66meeting, they will review study progress (i.e., recruitment goals, retention, protocol 
adherence). Any adverse events will be reviewed at this meeting including serious adverse 
events that may have been attended to outside of this biweekly meeting. [CONTACT_113490] will 
join at least every other occurrence of these meetings (i.e., at least every 4 weeks) and provide 
a second review of [CONTACT_658084]’s medical management decisions. [CONTACT_658089] will be available 
for consultations on medical issues related to older age (e.g., angina history).  
An annual progress report will be submitted to NIDDK and the Yale University IRB that lists 
and summarizes adverse events; documents whether adverse event rates are consistent with 
pre-study assumptions; summarizes recruitment and retention and reason for dropouts; and 
summarizes study progress related to the stated aims. 
C.Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_657981].  
There is no possibility in the present study of futility of treatment or overwhelming evidence of 
the benefit of treatment. This is because the purpose of the study is to develop and improve 
an intervention that will not be tested in a randomized controlled trial against usual care until 
a future study. 
IV. Informed Consent
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject at entry into the study. The informed 
consent process is described in section 5.5. Briefly, written consent to participate will be 
obtained from all participants after the research procedures and risks associated with 
participation have been explained. The entire consent form will be reviewed in detail with the 
participant via one-on-one HIPAA-compliant televideo (Zoom, San Jose, CA).  They will be 
asked to take the video call from a private setting which the researcher will verbally verify 
before starting the consent process.  The consent form will provide clear and explicit language 
about the intervention components, assessments, and study procedures. Any questions the 
participant may have will be addressed.  In order to identify and clarify any misconceptions, 
subjects will be encouraged to describe the research procedures and their associated risks in 
their own words, followed by [CONTACT_658080]. An Informed Consent Quiz is used to ensure understanding of study procedures. 
All research staff will receive extensive training from [CONTACT_642584] in appropriate procedures to 
obtain informed consent, including administering these measures of capacity to provide 
informed consent.  If participants wish, they may keep the consent form and consider it further 
before signing.  They may also request to speak to anyone on the research team about 
questions they have or to consult others, including their physician and family members. 
Following resolution of any questions or concerns, the participant will be asked to sign 
the eConsent form on REDCap, if he/she agrees to participate.  
[CONTACT_642584] will perform monthly audits for conformance with informed consent 
requirements.

Version #[ADDRESS_887237]. Ash will be responsible for data quality and management.  
Data Collection Forms
As described in section II-A, continuous glucose monitoring data will be monitored every 
2 weeks through the Dexcom application programing interface, and mobile diaries will be 
monitored daily through the GlucoseZone application programming interface.  This 
monitoring will include audits for completeness.  Other biosensors that continuously sync 
with their web application programming interface (Fitbit, insulin devices) will be monitored 
every [ADDRESS_887238]. Ash will also perform quarterly audits for conformance with 
source document completion.  
Data Integrity and Protection of Databases
Paper source documents will be entered into REDCap on a quarterly basis.  Databases will 
be exported quarterly from REDCap, Ilumivu, Qualtrics, and Actigraph Actilife onto Yale 
University secure servers and audited for completeness and aberrant values using frequency 
statistics.  Datasets from biosensors will be checked in on REDCap checklists as they are 
downloaded, and the checklists will be audited quarterly.  Original reports of all biosensor 
downloads will be retained for verification and further data analysis.
VI. Confidentiality
As described in Section 2.2 Risks:
While there is a possibility of a security breach compromising subject confidentiality, several 
steps will be taken to safeguard the confidentiality of subjects and their data.  All research 
data collected outside of the mobile applications will be assigned a study participant number 
and that number will only identify participants in digital databases on REDCap, Ilumivu, or 
Actigraph Actilife.  Audio-recorded interviews and orientation sessions will be transcribed and 
names, places, and any other identifying information will be removed.  The names of 
participants will not be associated with this data and assessments will be maintained according 
to participant study number. A master list connecting participant study numbers to participant 
names will be kept on a secure server where it can only be accessed by [CONTACT_658081].  Any information published as a result of the study will be such that it will not permit 
identification of any participant.  
All research data that is collected via the mobile applications (CGM, diary responses, exercise 
performance, insulin usage, carbohydrates, GPS) will be stored on the relevant web 
application programming interface (API) platforms (Dexcom, Fitbit, GlucoseZone), researcher 
dashboard (Ilumivu, Qualtrics), or user dashboard (InPen) in accord with Yale Information 
Technology Services protocols. After syncing the data, the data will be immediately deleted 
from the participants’ biosensor devices and smartphones.  Web-based application and user 
sessions are encrypted between the server and client browser through the use of industry 
standard SSL certificates.  As soon as each participant completes the study protocol, their 
data will be immediately transferred from the API [INVESTIGATOR_657982]-protection strategies, assigned to the de-identified participant study number noted in the 
previous paragraph, and deleted from the API [CONTACT_52804].  All data is encrypted both at rest and 
in transit.

68Right to privacy for participation in this research will be protected through alphanumeric coding 
of data (in place of names) and proper storage of research records, including interviews and 
data downloaded from the web API [CONTACT_52803].  Collected materials will be maintained via an 
alphanumeric reference system maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ash.  Participants’ names will appear only 
on the consent form, the HIPAA authorization form, and a master list maintained on REDCap 
that is separate from research data. Our data collection and management procedures are fully 
compliant with HIPAA.  Access will be limited to personnel intimately involved in the study.  
Electronic data will be deidentified and password protected.  Only members of the study team 
will have access to the physical or electronic data.

70Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent 
document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied;
Related or possibly related to participation in the research ("possibly related" means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and
Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.
If the study team becomes aware of an unanticipated problem (e.g. data breach, protocol 
deviation), the event will be reported to the IRB by a Report of New Information (RNI).
The UP report will include the following information:
Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI's name, and the IRB project 
number;
A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;
An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;
A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have 
been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:
UPs will be reported to the IRB within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of 
the event.

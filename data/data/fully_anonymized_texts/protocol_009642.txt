BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major and growing problem in 
children. A 70% increase in the annual rate of VTE  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755136] [1]. VTE often 
collectively referred to  as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE), is now considered an important endemic complication of 
tertiary care settings. Although often perceived as an acute disorder, 
VTE entails a long -term risk of persistent or progressive thrombosis , 
post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), recurrence and post -PE syndrome, 
also called chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH) [2]. Of all the VTE outcomes, PTS is the most frequent, chronic 
and debilitating complication [3]. As such, current therapy is merely 
focused on treating the acute VTE, not attempting to prevent late 
sequelae like PTS. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_755137], up to one half 
patients will develop these poor complications within 2 years of the acute 
event [4].   
 
VTE is not merely a ‘nuisance’ medical problem. Rather, VTE is costly 
and burdensome to patients and society , both in terms of dollars spent 
and effect on quality of life and productivity [5]. The estimated health care 
costs directly attributable to pediatric VTE for care of secondary VTE are 
five times higher than cos ts with an idiopathic VTE ($95,120 vs. 
$20,238) [5]. These costs are expected to be much higher in the 
presence of adverse outcomes of thrombosis [6]. 
  
Although PTS is a direct and most frequent DVT complication in 
children, effective  treatments are lacking and new innovative 
approaches to manage PTS are sorely needed . The 9th edition of the 
American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on 
antithrombotic Therapy in Neonates and Children, widely considered to 
represent the stan dard of care for pediatric thrombosis do not currently 
have any recommendations for management of pediatric PTS [7]. 
Recently, the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement 
to provide an up -to-date overview of PTS and concluded, “as a result of 
the paucity of studies in this area, it is not possible to make specific 
recommendations on the prevention or treatment of pediatric PTS ”, 
highlighting this as an area in pressing need of scientific 
investigation [8]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_755138], up to a quarter to one half of DVT patients develop 
PTS[3]. Lack of effective and evidence -based treatment for PTS is a 
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, [ADDRESS_1033757] frequent and debilitating complication after extremity 
DVT 
The annual rate of VTE - encompassing DVT and PE - has increased by 
70% in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_755139], to approximately 1 in 
200[1, 6] . Accompanying this increase i s the attendant increase in 
chronic sequelae of VTE, the most frequent of which is the PTS. PTS is 
the most burdensome complication of DVT. The lasting signs and 
symptoms of PTS include chronic pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], swelling, varicose 
collateral veins and in ext reme cases, painful venous ulcers [9]. 
Children with PTS have an impaired QoL [10]. 
 
Children at risk of or with PTS do not have any effective, evidence -based 
treatments available  
In contrast to the gains achieved in treating acute DVT, there are very 
few treatment options for PTS in children. Clinicians  often prescribe 
physical compression methods to counteract increased venous 
pressure. However, the SOX trial, the largest randomized trial so far of 
elastic compression stockings in adults did not prevent PTS with two 
years of use after a first proximal D VT[11]. Venoactive medications and 
surgical treatments for PTS such as venous valve repair or venous 
by[CONTACT_755150] [12, 13] . 
Novel approaches to the  treatment are sorely needed.  
 
 
Enhancing activity post DVT represents a new paradigm for pediatric 
PTS 
The pathophysiology of PTS involves: 1) damage to venous valves by 
[CONTACT_755151] [14], which causes 
valvular reflux; and 2) residual venous obstruction due to thrombus 
persistence leading to impaired venous return [15, 16] . Both processes 
result in venous hypertension. When DVT is diagnosed, standard 
anticoagulation treatment prevents clot extension and embolization, but 
does  not lyse the acute clot. Follow -up studies of patients with DVT 
treated with anticoagulants have shown only partial clearance of 
thrombus and even in patients who do achieve clot lysis, permanent 
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, 03 -02-21  damage to the valve occurs. This is thought to be via throm bus induced 
activation of inflammation or scarring associated with acute and 
resolving thrombosis, leading to valve incompetence as shown in studies 
of adults [14]. Aerobic activity increases oxygen delivery to muscle fibers, 
improves muscle metabolism and ox idative capacity [17]. It is plausible 
that this may counteract the hypoxic dam age to muscle contractile fibers 
and decreased muscle perfusion caused by [CONTACT_755152] [18]. It 
may aid faster venous recanalization by [CONTACT_755153]. Indeed, 
adult data sho w a tendency for higher levels of self -reported physical 
activity in 300 patients one month after DVT to be associated with less 
severe PTS three months later, suggesting that increasing physical 
activity may reduce symptoms of PTS [19]. Similarly, in another 2 -center 
Canadian pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 42 adults with PTS were randomized to 6 months 
of exercise training or control. Supervised exercise training was 
associated with improvement in PTS severity, QoL, leg strength and leg 
flexibility [20]. The potential benefits of enha nced physical activity have 
not been previously studied in the pediatric setting.  
 
Activity trackers show promise in incentive based activity trials in children  
While previous efforts have relied on self -report measures to increase 
activity, more recently  direct and objective fitness trackers have been 
used to track population levels of physical activity in children and 
adolescents [21, 22] . One such tracker, the Fitbit has shown high 
correlation with steps recorded by [CONTACT_62867], accuracy when 
compared to a gold standard pedometer and has been validated [23]. 
Recent studies show that tailored in tervention, such as responses and 
messaging created to address the needs of individuals on baseline 
steps/day maybe efficient and effective [24, 25] . Indeed, daily step target 
to measure physical activity in children has been shown to increase as a 
result of participating in activity tracker -based interventions in conjunction 
with daily step goals and incentives [26].  
 
Conceptual model of endothelial dysfunction and 
impaired fibrinolysis supports biomarker 
assessment in PTS 
The overall progression of the initial thrombotic 
event towards propagation or resolution depends 
on the balance between: 1) endothelial dysfunction 
and inflammation, and 2) residual venous 
obstruction from impaired fibrinolysis. Standard 
anticoagulati on relies upon endogenous fibrinolytic  
Figure 1 : Conceptual 
pathophysiological 
model underlying 
PTS.  

STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, 03 -02-21  mechanisms to remove thrombus, which are often impaired in children 
with DVT [27]. Even in those who achieve clot lysis, permanent damage 
to venous valves occurs frequently, likely via thrombus -induced activation 
of inflammation [14]. I propose th at a bidirectional relationship between 
inflammation and abnormal fibrinolysis drives a feedback loop resulting 
in increased complications after DVT over time, including PTS  (Figure 
1). Bringing together this insight and our current knowledge of 
coagulatio n assessment by [CONTACT_755154] -focusing on PTS - may 
uncover new and better approaches to identify and treat at -risk 
individuals. Exercise has shown to decrease thrombin generation and 
fibrinolytic markers in children as well as adults. Alterations in the l evel of 
related biomarkers, reflecting coagulation activation, inflammation and 
markers of fibrinolysis, may be of interest when assessing a patient’s risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_755140].  
 
Extrapolating from the above, I propose that an activity regimen for 
children a fter lower extremity DVT is unlikely to be harmful, maybe of 
benefit and needs further study. In the past, investigator initiated trials 
involving prevention or treatment of pediatric VTE have been terminated 
because of feasibility concerns [28]. Accordingly, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_755141] a fully 
powered, definitive trial.  
 
INNOVATION  
This proposal is innovative because: (1) it will be the first trial to integrate 
modern technological tools, such as activity trackers to improve 
adherence to life style interventions aimed at preventing PTS. Although 
there are many ways to increase physic al activity in children, my goal is 
to use a simple , user -friendly tool that will appeal to children across a 
broad age range; (2) activity/exercise as a therapeutic modality in 
children with DVT has not been previously studied; (3) there have been 
no prev ious randomized trials of PTS prevention or treatment in children; 
and (4) trial outcomes include patient reported outcomes (i.e. QoL) and 
laboratory based biomarkers.  
 
PRIMARY AIM:  
To demonstrate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of a personal 
“fitness tracker” to improve adherence to an activity regimen following an 
initial DVT in children.  
Hypothesis:   The intervention of using a fitness tracker to adhere to an 
activity regimen will be acceptable, and effective in improving adherence 
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, [ADDRESS_1033758] -DVT activity regimen in children. I propose a validated, fitness 
tracker, the Fitbit, to improve adherence to a 16-week activity regimen in 
a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT), in which [ADDRESS_1033759] of a) feasibility indicators determined a priori  
(eligibility, consent, adherence, retention) and b) estimates of effect size 
associated with the prescribed activity regimen, by [CONTACT_755155] -
subject change in QoL and ‘potential’ biomarkers of PTS pre and post 
intervention in each group.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  (Figure 2)  
The study design is that of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_755142], against standard 
practice, which currently 
consists of providing education 
about PTS and instructions to 
‘be active’ . I will use a validated 
activity tracker, t he Fitbit and its 
data platform - the Fitabase.

The study has [ADDRESS_1033760] 
of care visi ts.  
 
Screening  
The parents/legal guardians will be given an explanation about the 
study and informed consent and/or assent will be obtained. This may 
occur in the inpatient or the outpatient setting.  Demographic 
information and relevant medical history, including results of scans and 
thrombophilia testing will be collected. All medications, including 
anticoagulant medication received for the thrombotic event will be 
recorded.   
a. Baseline Assessment s (collected as SOC  (standard of care) ):   
i. History and Physical Examination:  
1. Detailed history regarding medical disorders 
predisposing to thrombosis and potential triggers 
(birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], recent travel or surgery or 
immobility) and predispositions (thrombophilia, 
obesity etc.) will be collected.  
2. Review of existing medical records recorded on 
Children’s Medical Center electronic medical 
record to review past medical, family and social 
history will be performed.   
3. Comprehensive physical exam (PE) consisting 
of vital signs, general appearance, head, eyes, 
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, 03 -02-21  ears, nose , throat (HEENT), cardio -respir atory, 
abdominal, extremities and skin will be 
performed at each visit as per standard of care.  
ii. Laboratory:  
1. Complete blood count (CBC), reticulocyte count, 
baseline coagulation studies , and a 
comprehensive thrombophilia panel performed 
as SOC will be recor ded. 
 
 
 
iii. Treatment:  
1. Information on anticoagulant therapy 
(medication of choice, intensity of 
anticoagulation, planned duration of therapy) 
prescribed as per the treating physician will be 
collected for subjects who meet eligibility criteria 
and whose parents provide written i nformed 
consent  
iv. Radiological:  
1. All information related to site, extent and venous 
segments involved of the thrombotic venous 
segment at the time of diagnosis, and at 
completion of therapy will be collected. 
Information on reflux assessment at the time of 
end of therapy ultrasound will also be collected.  
v. Assessmen t of Post -thrombotic syndrome (PTS):  
All subje cts with will be assessed with standardized, 
validated outcome assessment tools: the Manco -
Johnson Instrument and the modified Villalta scale  
starting at [ADDRESS_1033761] of care . See appendix 1 for these scales.  
 
b. Study Interventions:  
i. Study procedures/Randomization : 
Eligible, consenting subjects will be individually 
randomized via a web -based program to the Fitbit arm 
or the control arm (1:1 allocation ratio).  
1. Intervention (Fitbit) arm.  The intervention arm will 
wear  a Fitbit for a 16-week period ( Figure  2). 
General Principles of an aerobic activity regimen:  
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, [ADDRESS_1033762] opted to use a 
walking -jogging program to capture steps/day by 
[CONTACT_31275]. This will target all potentially affected 
muscles (quadriceps , hamstrings ad 
gastrocnemius/soleus). If preferred by [CONTACT_423], 
other weight bearing exercises could replace the 
walk/jog, for example, dancing or team sports such 
as basketball or volleyball. Because of the 
unfamiliarity with activity trackers, subjec ts will be 
provided with hands -on training to promote 
successful use of the Fitbit and Fitabase.  
a. Schedule and procedures (Table 1 ): After 
consent (baseline visit), subjects in this arm will 
receive a standardized 15-20 minute education 
session  on PTS (what constitutes PTS, why 
patients get it, how to manage it) and enhanced 
activity after DVT . Subjects will be asked to wear 
the Fitbit for a period of four weeks to establish 
baseline or ‘habitual’ activity. Using steps/day 
data received at the end of four weeks, we  will 
determine an individualized activity prescription 
of ‘target  
steps/day’, corresponding to a 25% increase 
above the baseline.

be up to the choice of the subject) after DVT; 2) 
monthly phone contacts will be made  to check in 
with patients/families and remind them about 
completion of activity logs and follow -up visits.  
 
Study  assessments for both arms  
1. Biomarker testing : Blood for biomarker  of 
coagulation activation  (D-dimer, FVIII, thrombin 
generation), markers of inflammation (CRP), and 
markers of fibrinolysis {modified 
thromboelastogram (TEG) with fibrinolysis , PAI -1, 
will be obtained at each visit One and a half extra 
teaspoons will be collected at each visit  for a total 
of 4.[ADDRESS_1033766]’s 
time in the study.  
2. Elastic compression stockings (ECS)  
i. Subjects in both arms will be provided with 
custom fitted compression stockings and their 
use will be tracked using EC S logs throughout 
study period. In general, SOC 
recommendations are to wear ECS starting 
after the diagnosis of DVT and to continue as 
long as they provide benefit in regards to pain 
and swelling , up to a period of two years post 
DVT diagnosis. For the sake of the study, their 
use will be documented strictly during the 
study period.  
3. Activity log completion during the intervention period 
will be used to record physical activities. These  logs 
will capture information on the type of activity, and 
the frequency and duration of activity  
4. Quality of life ( all visits ): QoL will be measured using 
the PedsQL TM which is a modular approach to 
measure generic health related quality of life in both 
healthy children and adolescents, as well as those 
with acute and chronic health conditions. It consists 
of structured interview with the parents and the child 
with 23 items divided among 4 sub -scales to assess 
function in 4 domains: Physical ; Emotional; s ocial; 
and School . The instrument is brief, takes [ADDRESS_1033767] age range.  
5. PTS : Modified Villal ta’s scale and Marilyn -Manco 
Johnson Instruments, the two validated PTS scales , 
will be used to diagnos e and grade severity of PTS 
at the 6 month mark  corresponding to Visit 2  and the 
9 month mark (corresponding to Visit 3) . The 
principal and co -investigators will complete PTS 
evaluations  as is standard o f care  at Visit [ADDRESS_1033768] (currently 
routinely assigned to the Thrombosis and Bleeding 
Disorders Program) at both visits . 
6. Medication adherence: Anti-Xa and INR will be 
collected for participants on lovenox and warfarin , 
respectively. Families with participants on 
Rivaroxaban will be asked to complete a medication 
log because no assay will be used to measure 
adherence for Rivaroxaban. The medication log will 
measure compliance with anticoagulation during 
active treatment  period and will include the subject’s 
specific anticoagulant, dose, and date and time 
medication was taken.  
 
See appendix for copi[INVESTIGATOR_755143], administration and scoring 
procedures.  
 
IV. PARTICIPANT TIMELINE  
All study visits will coincide with  standard -of-care visits for patients with 
VTE at our center . All visits will be allowed a time window to 
accommodate preferences of subjects and families  ± 2 weeks for visit 1  
and ±4 weeks for visit 2 and 3 . 
 
Study assessments : (Table 1  for schedule of events).  
 
V.MODIFICATIONS  
a. RISKS  
i. Blood Draws: Risks associated with drawing blood 
include minimal discomfort and/or bruising, infection, 
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, 03 -02-21  excess bleeding, clotting, and/or fainting are 
possible.  
ii. Doppler Ultrasound: There are no risks from the 
sound waves used for ultrasound.  The test is not 
painful and does not have any radiation. This  will be 
done as per standard of care.  
iii. Skin irritation or allergies wit h wearing the activity 
tracker  
iv. Injuries or falls related to increased physical activity  
v. As we plan to use an online data format to gather 
subject information, security of information may be a 
concern. Fitabase code and databases reside on 
the Microsoft Windows Azure Platform and rely on 
the robust security, both physical on -premise 
guarding, and over network, provided as part of that 
platform. Windows Azure runs in data centers that 
comply with key industry standards for security and 
reliability . 
vi. Loss of confidentiality related to use of protected 
health information ( PHI). 
 
b. BENEFITS  
Study subjects may discontinue their participation at any 
time. However, information regarding the potential benefits 
to continue on the study will be made explicitly clear prior to 
their discontinuation.  
i. Whether or not the subject or their family consent s, 
the schedule of the clinic visits will remain the same 
as proposed in the study. All patients with 
thrombosis are followed until they become adults 
with more frequent visits in the first [ADDRESS_1033769] DVT patients, many do not 
use them due to th e expense of the stockings and 
lack of availability.  
c. Every effort will be made to retain study subjects  in the trial 
for the entire ~9 months to enable complete follow -up and 
data collection.  
 
V. WITHDRAWAL/TERMINATION  
a. Subjects that ‘No Show’ for Visit 2 , are unable to provide 
>80% of the ‘steps/day’  data and are unable to be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]/rescheduled. Data already collected will be used 
in the analysis.  
b. Subjects for whom an a lternative diagnosis discovered . 
c. In the investigator’s medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is best to with draw 
the subject from the protocol  
 
VI. CONCOMITANT CARE  
a. Patients who initially receive thrombosis care elsewhere 
prior to enrollment may participate in the study if all 
eligibility criteria are met.  
b. Subjects who need to continue long term prophylactic 
anticoa gulation will still be eligible and will be included at 
discretion of their attending h ematologist.  
c. The activity tracker, the Fitbit, is made up of a flexible 
durable material used in many sports watches (and one 
that does not contain latex) with a surgica l grade stainless 
steel clasp and contains traces of nickel. It is meant to be 
worn day and night on the wrist. Because there’s a 
possibility of skin irritation and allergies with any type of 
jewelry, all participants in this study will be warned and care 
and wearing tips will be provided. They will be monitored for 
any skin problems during the clinic visits and a treatment 
plan will be made in collaboration with their primary 
pediatrician should any skin irritation develop. I will ask to 
be notified immedi ately of any such occurrence at home 
and will then contact [CONTACT_755156]022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, 03 -02-21  their clinical condition and make a treatment plan based on 
the severity of the skin condition.  
 
VII. OUTCOMES AND POWER CALCULATIONS  
Primary Outcomes  will be  1) feasibility indicators (Table 2) 
measured throughout trial.  The level of adherence in the 
intervention group will be calculated as the proportion meeting the 
weekly steps/day goal during the 
‘active’ 8 -week period of the total 1 6 
weeks of intervention as determined 
by [CONTACT_755157], 
and 2) change in clinical outcomes  
such as PTS biomarkers at baseline and Visit 2 , and QoL (at all 
visits ).  Secondary outcome : I will assess for PTS with validated 
scales at the [ADDRESS_1033770] of care.   
Analyses : The objectives of this trial are to assess the feasibility of 
the design  and to measure the effect size of the intervention . All 
analyses will therefore be descriptive and will be performed once, 
at the end of the trial . Means and  standard deviations, or when 
appropriate, medians and semi -inter-quartile ranges will be used 
to describe demographic and clinical characteristics. Reasons for 
non-eligibility, lack of consent, dropout and lack of compliance will 
be documented.  For feasibility indicators , we (study investigators 
and Song Zhang -biostatistician)  will describe rate of eligibility 
(proportion of subjects screened who fully meet trial eligibility 
criteria to participate in the trial), rate of consent (the proportion of 
eligible subjects who consent to participate) and rate of loss to 
follow -up (proportion of randomized subjects who drop out of the 
trial, in total, and by [CONTACT_755158]). We will also describe 
the level of compliance in the intervention group, calculated as the 
ratio of who complied with the activity prescription to the number 
given the prescription. We will consider the trial successful  if the 
following criteria are met: rate of eligibility ≥ 30%, rate of consent 
≥ 30%, rate of loss of follow -up <20%, level of compliance ≥ 60% 
and proportion of subjects who complete the trial ≥ 80%. For the 
clinical outcomes  (including the secondary outc omes), we will 
describe change (means and standard deviations) in the 
intervention and control groups, from baseline to [ADDRESS_1033771] of covariates such as age, sex, BMI, baseline activity, 
intensity of activity over and above the activity prescription, on 
change scores.  
Sample size calculation : For reasons of practicality and cost, we 
have decided to limit the size of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_755144] 44 subjects (20 
in each arm; 22 after considering a 20% drop out rate). We 
anticipate that the probable primary outcome for the larger trial 
will be change in rate of PTS development and/or progression. 
This trial may also provide compelling preliminary data for future 
studies . For example, if this intervention reduces the risk of PTS 
from 26% (known probability of PTS) to 10%, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_297536] 
71% chance of showing a promising trend (p -value<0.2) tha t the 
intervention reduces the risk of PTS. We acknowledge that the 
small size of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_755145]; 
therefore, we will be cautious with such analyses.  
 
 
I. RECRUITMENT  
a. Information about the clinical study will be provided via 
direct communication by [CONTACT_755159]’s Medical Center including ED physicians, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266], and general pediatricians attending on the 
inpatient medicine services and outpatient continuity clinic 
as well as house offi cers.  
b. Information regarding the study will be available on the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern clinical trials website and 
at clinicaltrials.gov.  
c. Potential subjects will be identified through review of new 
patient referrals to Children’s Medical Center, inpatient 
admissions and/or consultations for thrombosis.  
d. Each subject will receive financial compensation for 
participation. Payment will be made at comp letion of the 
study visits at Visits 1 and 2  ($25 each ) and at the end of 
Visit 3  ($50)  based on atte ndance and return of the tracking 
logs.  
e. Expected recruitment rate will be 2-[ADDRESS_1033772] been enrolled on the 
study, or at approximately 9 -12 months.  
 
II. DATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND ANALYSIS  
a. DATA COLLECTION METHODS  
Clinical information will be collected from each patient’s 
electronic medical record at all visits while on study.  T his 
information will include the following: name, gender, race, 
ethnicity, date of birth, current medications, social history, 
patient medical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52122]; family history, 
physical exam and laboratory results. Additional information 
to be c ollected from self reported diaries include adherence 
data and adverse reaction data. Returned diaries will be 
maintained in a research binder, while medical history, lab 
results, and medications will be recorded in the electronic 
medical record and then o n electronic Case Report Forms 
(eCRF). Contact [CONTACT_755160].  
 
b. DATA MANAGEMENT  
The eCRF will be housed in UT Southwestern REDCap. 
REDCap is a self -managed, secure, web -based dat a 
support system.  The data is backed up offsite nightly and 
hosted in a secure environment maintained by [CONTACT_755161]. This password protected study database will 
include a subject’s personal identifiers and all Protected 
Health Information (PHI)  such as medical history. All 
personnel who will be accessing the data will be trained in 
REDCap and have individual user ID and passwords. 
Subjects will have a study ID number that will be utilized in 
lieu of personally identifiable information for all re search 
data provided to statisticians.  
 
c. STATISTICAL  ANALYSES  
The following will be calculated:  the proportion of screened patients 
who fully met trial eligibility criteria, the proportion of eligible patients 
who consented to participate, the proportion in the physical activity/ 
Fitbit group who adhered to prescribed activity, and the proportion of  
randomized patients who completed the trial (in total, and by [CONTACT_755162]). The feasibility outcomes will be  reported descriptively 
STU022016 -057, Zia, FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_18, 03 -02-21  using mean (standard deviations [SD]) for continuous outcomes, and 
raw counts (%) for categorical outcomes are r eported. For the clinical 
end points, using an intent -to-treat analysis that includes all participants 
with data at baseline and 6 months (end of the intervention period), 
within -patient change from baseline (diagnosis or pre -VTE levels) to 6 
months (mean,  SD) in the physical activity will be compared to  
standard care in the following measures: D -dimer, FVIII, CRP, thrombin 
generation assay parameters of endogenous thrombin potential and 
peak thrombin, fibrinolysis on thromboelastography, QoL (total and 
physical), selfreported physical activity levels, and PTS (change from 6 
to 9 months). This will be  averaged for each group, and within -group 
differences will be  compared between the standard care and physical 
activity groups using a t test. ECS use will be  descriptively described 
but not included in a formal analysis.

Health -Related Quality of Life  (QoL) Instruments  
 
General QoL:  
The PedsQL TM is a modular approach to measure generic health 
related quality of life in both healthy children and adolescents, as well 
as those with acute and chronic health conditions. It consists of 
structured interview with the parents and the child with 23 items divided 
among 4 sub -scales to assess function in 4 domains: Physical; 
Emotional; social; and School. Each item is a statement of a problem, 
which the subject rates in severity from 0 -4, indicating a problem neve r 
occurs (score of 0) to almost always occurs (score of 4). The 
instrument is brief, takes [ADDRESS_1033777] of DVT and PTS on symptoms and quality of 
life from the patient’s perspective.  The item covers symptoms (10 
items), limitations on daily activities ( 9 items), time of day of greatest 
intensity (1 item), change over the past year (1 item), and psychological 
impact (5 items).

This is short survey to find out about your level of physical activity 
before and after you developed a blood clot. These includes sports or 
dance that make you sweat or make your legs feel tired, or games that 
make you breathe hard, like tag, skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], ru nning, climbing, and 
others.  
 
Your answers will help us understand how a blood clot affects your 
ability to be active.  We believe your answers will help us treat you and 
other children with blood clots better.

Patients will be asked to complete a vertigo VAS for vertigo intensity and 
nausea intensity twice daily in the morning between 10:00 am and 12:[ADDRESS_898098] before the study drug intake.  
Patients will continue to be monitored for vertigo, nausea and vomiting, 
vital signs (both supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]), ability to unassisted walk, and 
imbalance assessment (Romberg tests) until discharge from the h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_664896] a full efficacy assessment will be performed. It will include 
assessment of the quality of life, and VOG. The same assessments will be 
performed at the following visit on day 5 and at the end of the study on 
day 28. Only the assessments planne d during the visits are mandatory.  The 
additional assessments planned during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521]  (i.e. 
Romberg test twice a day and VNG once a day) are considered optional. 
In case some of these assessments cannot be performed (for example 
during th e week -end), this should not prevent from including a patient.

1. Overview  
 
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the planned analysis and reporting for Sensorion 
protoco l number SENS 111 -201 (A multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 dose regimens of orally administered SENS -111 
(100 mg and 200 mg) given during 4 days in patients suffering from Acute Unilatera l 
Vestibulopathy), dated 05 -Nov-2018 version #4.0. Reference materials for this statistical plan 
include the protocol and the accompanying sample data collection documents. Operational 
aspects related to collection and timing of planned clinical assessment s are not repeated in this 
SAP unless relevant to the planned analysis.  
The structure and content of this SAP provides sufficient detail to meet the requirements 
identified by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), 
and Int ernational Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for 
Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use: Guidance on Statistical Principles in Clinical 
Trials1. All work planned and reported for this SAP will  follow internationally accepted 
guidelines, published by [CONTACT_470585]2 and the Royal Statistical Society3, 
for statistical practice.  
The planned analyses identified in t his SAP may be included in clinical study reports (CSRs), 
regulatory submissions, or future manuscripts. Also, post -hoc exploratory analyses not 
necessarily identified in this SAP may be performed to further examine study data. Any post -hoc

 2.2. Study  Endpoints  
 
2.2.1.  Safety  Endpoints  
 
The safety endpoints are adverse events (AEs), laboratory, vital signs, and ECG . 
Each AE will be coded to a Preferred Term and associated System Organ Class (SOC) according 
to an established and validated adverse reaction dicti onary (MedDRA, version 20.0) before the 
randomized treatment code is broken.  
The AE endpoints are number of patients experiencing:  
• at least 1 event  
• an event under each recorded Preferred  Term  
• an event under each recorded  SOC  
These endpoints apply to all AE s, regardless of relationship of the event to the study drug.  
 
2.2.2.  Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the vertigo intensity measured by [CONTACT_233834] 
(AUC) of the Vertigo Intensity Visual Analogue Scale (VI -VAS) in standing position over the 4 
treatment days ([ADDRESS_898126] -baseline assessments).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
The secondary efficacy endpoints deal with the comparison between treatment groups of:  
1. Worst spontaneous vertigo intensity measured  by [CONTACT_664921] -VAS over the 
4 treatment days ([ADDRESS_898127] baseline assessments)  
2. Change from baseline of the total score of the Romberg tests at the end of the  treatment 
(D5) and at the end of study  (D28)  
3. Change from baseline of the peak slow phase velocity (SPV) of the peripheral vestibular 
spontaneous nystagmus, measured by [CONTACT_664922] 
(D5) and end of study  (D28)  
4. Nausea severity measured by [CONTACT_664923] 
(NI-VAS) over t he 4 treatment days ([ADDRESS_898128] baseline  assessments)  
5. Change from baseline of the functional disability at the end of study (D28) assessed by 
[CONTACT_664924] (DHI) functional subscale  score  
6. The functional disability at the end of study (D28) assessed the Vestibular  Disorders 
Activities of Daily Living Scale  (VADL)  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory Efficacy  Endpoint(s)  
The exploratory efficacy endpoints of this study include the following:

 1. Vertigo Intensity in standing position at the end of the study (D28) assessed by  [CONTACT_664925]-VAS  
2. Worst spontaneous vertigo at the end of the study (D28) assessed by [CONTACT_664926]-VAS  
3. Time to unassisted walk assessed by a specific  question  
4. Health economic evaluation assessed with the Work Productivity and Activity 
Impair ment (WPAI -SHP) questionnaire at the end of  study.  
 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic  Variable(s)  
 
Serum samples are collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis at 3 time points: H12, H24, and 
at end of treatment visit (D5). In cases where PK sample cannot b e taken at H12 or H24, it is  also 
acceptable to take a PK sample before the 4th intake (H48 ). Plasma concentration of SENS -111 
will be used as the parameter to describe the plasma exposure to  SENS -111. 
No pharmacodynamic (PD) variables are being investigated in this study.  
 
2.2.4.  Ancillary  Endpoints  
 
Additional tests will be performed at baseline and at the end of the study in sites participating in 
the ancillary study:  
• Video -head impulse test (vHIT) which provides a quick and objective measure of  the 
vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) in response to head  movements  
• Caloric test which provides two parameters: total response (TR) and relative vestibular 
reduction  (RVR)  
 
3. Overall Study Design and  Plan  
 
The study is a double -blind, randomized, [ADDRESS_898130] acebo -controlled, international study 
in patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy.  
This study will be a multicenter international study conducted in about 38 sites in Europe, Israel, 
US, and South Korea. Each patient’s participation in the study will be 28 days: [ADDRESS_898131]  
60 mm on a 100 mm VAS measured in standing position feet together. 
It is plan ned to enroll 105 patients into 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio:  
• 35 patients receiving SENS -111 200 mg daily for 4  days 
• 35 patients receiving SENS -111 100 mg daily for 4  days 
• [ADDRESS_898132]-33.05 Effective date: 22 -Jan-2018  
Version1.2 | 12 -Nov-2019 | AD -PR-109.01 Effective date: 26 -Jun-2017  Page 19 of 58   
 This study includes a screening/incl usion phase, a treatment phase, and a follow -up phase. The 
screening and inclusion are to be done no more than [ADDRESS_898133]; the study drug is 
to be taken immediately after all baseline assessment are performed.  
The screening evaluation includes: vital signs, a complete oto -neurological examination, a 
nausea and vertigo evaluation that will confirm the diagnosis and the absence of exclusion 
criteria for past medical history, concomitant treatments, laboratory tests, or other concomitant 
diseases. Specific attention will be paid to exclude any patient with a stroke in the last 3 months 
(a negative past MRI is needed for inclusion of patients wit h possible stroke of the brainstem or 
cerebellum).  
Following this screening phase, eligible patients will undergo a nystagmus evaluation with a 
videooculography (VOG), and either a head impulse test or caloric test or both to confirm the 
diagnosis. They wi ll complete vertigo evaluations with VAS scores and questionnaires, 
assessment of imbalance (Romberg tests), nausea and vomiting scales just before the first intake 
of the investigational drug at the investigational site. Patients will be requested to stay  under 
medical supervision for at least [ADDRESS_898134] before  the second dose regimen is given. In cases 
where PK sample cannot be taken at H12 or H24, it is also acceptable to take a PK sample before 
the 4th intake (H48).  
Patients will be asked to complete a vertigo VAS for vertigo intensity and nausea intensity tw ice 
daily in the morning between 10:00 am and 12:[ADDRESS_898135] before 
the study drug intake. Patients will continue to be monitored for vertigo, nausea and vomiting, 
vital signs (both supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]), ability to unassisted walk, and imbalance assessment 
(Romberg tests) until discharge from t he hospi[INVESTIGATOR_664901] a full efficacy assessment will be 
performed. It will include assessment of the quality of life, and VOG. The same assessments will 
be performed at the following visit on day [ADDRESS_898136] anned during the visits are mandatory. The additional assessments planned during 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60521] (i.e. Romberg test twice a day and VNG once a day) are considered 
optional. In case some of these assessments cannot be performed (for example durin g the week - 
end), this should not prevent from including a patient.  
Patients will be followed for AEs throughout the study. Inquiry about potential AEs will be done 
at every on -site visit and on day 14 when a phone call will be given.  
Safety parameters will include routine blood tests (complete blood count, chemistry, liver 
function tests and lipid profile), pregnancy tests (if applicable), cardiac evaluation by [CONTACT_90660], 
physical exams and vital signs (with orthostatic blood pressure).  
The WPAI -SHP questionnaire will be requested at the end of study visit (D28).  
Additional tests will be conducted at some specific sites participating in an ancillary study:

For full details of the study design, please refer to the  protocol.  
3.1. Overall  Design  
3.2. Sample Size and  Power  
The sample size calculation is based on the AUC of the VI -VAS from baseline included to 
second measurement of Day 4 included.  
The assumptions are the followings:  
• Each comparison to placebo performed at 5% one -sided -significance  level  
• Power of each comparison to placebo set to  75% 
• Randomization ratio  1:1:1  
• Intra -group standard deviation of 71  mm/day  
• Difference to placebo of 40 mm/day (i.e. 20% of an average AUC of 200 mm/day  on 
placebo)  
3.3. Study  Population  
Men and women aged 18 -75 years, suffering from Acute Unilateral Vestibulopathy.  
3.4. Treatments  Administered  
Orally disintegrating t ablets (ODT) will be given once daily for 4 days:  
• SENS -111 200 mg: 100 mg ODT + 100 mg  ODT  
• SENS -111 100 mg: 100 mg ODT + placebo  ODT  
• Matching placebo: placebo ODT + placebo  ODT  
The orally disintegrating placebo tablets match SENS -111 (100 mg) tablets, and are identical in 
appearance. An additional dose (respectively 200 mg, 100 mg and placebo) will be administered 
to the patients approximately [ADDRESS_898138] ively.  
3.5. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  Groups  
The randomization will be managed centrally using an interactive web system response (IWRS).  
A total of 105 eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment 
groups, stratified by [CONTACT_664927] (≤ 24 hours, > 24 hours), as 
determined at the time of randomization.  
A patient will be considered randomized when the IWRS has given the treatment number to be 
allocated.  
All randomized subjec ts (Day 1) will receive either SENS [ADDRESS_898139]-33.05 Effective date: 22 -Jan-2018  
Version1.2 | 12 -Nov-2019 | AD -PR-109.01 Effective date: 26 -Jun-2017  Page 21 of 58   
 • The treatment will be given once  daily.  
• The first dose (2 ODT) will be given at the  site. 
• An additional dose (2 ODT) will be given approximately [ADDRESS_898140] dose (not 
less than [ADDRESS_898141]  dose).  
3.6. Blinding and  Unblinding  
The orally disintegrating placebo tablets match SENS -111 (100 mg) tablets, and are identical.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters that could potentially unblind the study team will not be disclosed 
during the conduct of the study.  
Investigators will have no access to the randomization code except under the special 
circu mstances. In case of an emergency, when knowledge of the randomization status is deemed 
necessary for the medical care of the patient, the randomization code can be unblinded for a 
specific patient.  
3.7. Schedule of  Events  
A detailed schedule of events for the study is provided in Table [ADDRESS_898142]-33.05 Effective date: 22 -Jan-2018

4. Statistical Analysis and  Reporting  
 
4.1. Introduction  
Data processing, tabulation of descriptive statistics, calculation of inferential statistics, and 
graphical representations wi ll be performed primarily using SAS (release 9.4 or higher). If the 
use of other software is warranted, the final statistical methodology report will detail what 
software was used for what purposes.  
Continuous (quantitative) variable summaries will include  the number of subjects (n) with 
non-missing values, the number of missing values, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum, and maximum, unless otherwise specified.  
Categorical (qualitative) variable summaries will include the frequency and percenta ge of 
subjects who are in the particular category or each possible value. In general, the denominator 
for the percentage calculation will be based upon the total number of subjects in the study 
population for the treatment groups, unless otherwise specifie d. 
The number of missing values will be calculated as difference of the total number of subjects in 
the study population for the treatment group minus the number of non -missing values.  
The minimum and maximum will be reported with the same degree of precis ion (i.e., the same 
number of decimal places) as the observed data. Measures of location (mean and median) will be 
reported to 1 degree of precision more than the observed data and measures of spread (SD) will 
be reported to [ADDRESS_898148], unless otherwise specified.  
 
4.2. Interim Analysis and Data  Monitoring  
 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will independently monitor subject safety 
during the SENS [ADDRESS_898149] and monitoring of randomized clinical trials. The DMC does not include 
Sponsor’s per sonnel or personnel from Contract Research Organizations (CRO) appointed by [CONTACT_429].  
The DMC meetings will be held:  
• (first meeting) after [ADDRESS_898150] completed the  study  
• thereafter, when a further 35 patients (approximately) have completed the study  or 
annualy (whichever comes  first)

reports. The unblinded or partially blinded analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_664928].  
The DMC is empowered to make recommendations on the SENS -111-201 study based on the 
results of the ir reviews. The possible recommendations the DMC can make are to:  
• Continue the trial without  modification  
• Continue the trial with protocol amendments (DMC will provide details of suggested 
modifications and reasons for the modifications according to the be nefit/risk  ratio)  
• Modify or strengthen safety  procedures  
• Suspend enrolment and treatment administration in the trial pending further  information  
• Terminate the trial earlier  
The scope of responsibility of the DMC, its membership and its confidentiality, as well as the 
frequency, content, and format of data review meetings, is described in a separate DMC charter 
of operations approved by [CONTACT_664929] t o the first review meeting.  
No other interim analysis, except DMC analysis, is planned.  
 
5. Analysis  Populations  
 
The followings are planned for this study:  
• Screened Population ( Screened): The Screened Population includes all screened and 
consented subjects.  This population will be used for disposition  only.  
• Safety Population (SAF): The Safety Population includes all treated patients according 
to first treatment actually received. Note that the Safety population may also be referred 
as Safety Analysis  Set. 
• Intention -To-Treat Population (ITT): The ITT population includes all  randomized 
patients.  
• Modified Intention -To-Treat Population (mITT): The mITT population includes all 
patients of the ITT population with a unilateral AUV (diagnosed before or after 
randomiz ation), a baseline standing VI -VAS ≥ [ADDRESS_898153] one study drug 
intake.  
• Per-Protocol Population (PP): The PP population includes all patients of the mITT  
population with the primary efficacy endpoint (AUC for the standing VI -VAS)  available 
and without a protocol deviation likely to impact the primary efficacy  endpoint.  
• Ancillary Population (ANC): The Ancillary Population includes all patients  performing 
ancillary tests, i.e video -head impulse test and/or caloric  test. 
The ITT population will be the primary population for efficacy analysis. The PP population will 
be secondary for the efficacy analysis. The mITT population will be used for a sensitivity

 efficacy analysis in a selection of endpoints: standing VI -VAS, worst VI -VAS, and nausea 
intensity VAS. The SAF will be used for the analyses of safety endpoints.  
 
All efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the randomized treatment  assignment by 
[CONTACT_10966]; all safety analyses will be conducted to the treatment actually received.  
 
Subjects to be included in the PP Population will be determined by [CONTACT_664930]. A subject with a protocol deviation who is classified as ‘major’ per the 
Protocol Deviation Guidance Plan will be excluded from the PP Population only if the protocol 
deviation may directly impact the primary efficacy endpoint.  
 
Subjects with a major protocol deviation may be excluded from the PP Population if any of the 
following are met:  
 
• Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria that may impact the primary efficacy  endpoint  
• Intake of any interfering concomitant  medication  
 
• Randomization  error  
6. General Issues for Statistical  Analysis  
 
6.1. Statistical Definitions and  Algorithms  
 
6.1.1.  Baseline  
 
For the VAS endpoints, the baseline observation is the first observation recorded in the ePRO on 
the day of the randomization or otherwise the last observation before the day of the 
randomization.  
For the  Romberg score and sub scores, the Average and Peak Slow phase velocity,  the 
baseline observation is the observation recorded in the eCRF at Visit [ADDRESS_898154]-33.05 Effective date: 22 -Jan-2018

Version1.2 | 12 -Nov-2019 | AD -PR-109.01 Effective date: [ADDRESS_898155] VI -VAS, and NI -VAS  
won't be replaced in the calculation of the AUC. Since the trapezoid rule will be used to calculate 
the AUC, linear interpolation of intermediate values or no imputation at all will lead to the same 
AUC estimation. Missing final meas urement(s) (e.g. in case of patient's withdrawal) will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_190381] (baseline observation carried forward) if the reason for missing data is severe 
vertigo or by [CONTACT_317875] (last observation carried forward), i.e. absence of improvement, if the reason 
for missing data is nausea, other or unknown.  
A mixed model without replacement of missing values using a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) for repeated measures will be conducted to examine whether or not results are robust to 
the data imputation.  
Any subject who withdraws from the study will be considered as study discontinuation. Subjects 
who discontinue study should be assessed in accordance with the assessments/tests specified 
normally for the end of the study visit.  
 
6.1.4.  Analysis Visit  Windows  
As per protocol a window of ±6 hours is allowed for the screening visit, while a window of ±3 is 
allowed for visit at H12 and H24. For the end of treatment visit, a window of -1 to +2 days is 
allowed. A window of ±2 days is allowed for the phone ca ll visit and the end of study visit.  
Statistical analyses will be based on scheduled visit as collected in the eCRF without further 
realignment.  
 
6.1.5.  Pooling of Sites  
 
As there are expected to be relatively few patients per centre, the centre will not be taken  into 
account in the analyses. Therefore the question of pooling of centres does not arise. However, a 
breakdown by [CONTACT_664931]’ disposition.  
 
6.1.6.  Derived  Variables  
 
The following derived and computed variables have been  initially identified as important for the 
analysis of efficacy.  
It is expected  that additional  variables  will be required.  The SAP will not be amended  for additional 
variables  that are not related  to the primary  target  or key secondary  target  variables.  Any additional 
derived or computed variables will be identified and documented in the SAS programs that  create 
the analysis files. If the SAP is not amended, further derivations related to primary and  secondary 
target variables will be described  in the  CSR.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment -emergent adverse  events  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as events occurring after the first dose

 If the start date of an AE are partially or completely missing, the AE will be assumed to be 
treatment -emergent if it cannot be definitely shown that the AE did n ot occur or worsen during 
the treatment -emergent period (worst case approach). Missing dates will not be replaced.  
The following are used for guidance for  programmers.  
• If the start date of the AE is complete, the AE will be excluded from  treatment -emergent  
AEs if the start day is before day of first treatment or the start day is after end day of the 
treatment -emergent  period.  
• If the day is missing but the start month is complete, an AE will only be excluded from 
treatment emergent AEs if the start month is before month of first treatment or the  start 
month is after end month of treatment -emergent period or if the stop date is before the 
start of first  treatment.  
• If the start day and months are missing but the start year is complete, an AE will only be 
exclud ed from treatment -emergent AEs if the start year is before year of first treatment  or 
if the start year is after end year of treatment -emergent period or if the stop date is before 
the start of first  treatment.  
If the start date is completely missing, an AE will not be excluded from treatment -emergent AEs 
unless the stop date is before the start of first treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Area under the  curve  
The baseline assessment and the first [ADDRESS_898158] -baseline assessments will be included in the 
calculation of the AUC.  
The AUC calculation includes the 4 days of treatment, from baseline to 96±6 hours. All 
assessments within baseline and baseline + 102 hours will be included in the calculation. The 
AUC will not be calculated if no baseline value is available or if no VAS assessment is available 
between 18 (12+6) hours and 102 (96+6) hours from baseline for reason not linked to severe 
vertigo.  
The interval between baseline and the first post -baseline assessment will be included in the AUC 
calculation.  Skipped assessments do not extend the time interval used. Missing intermediate 
measurements will not be replaced in the calculation of the AUC. Missing final measurements 
will be replaced as described in Section 6.1.3  with t ime of assessment equal to 96 hours.  
The AUC for the VAS will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule, which is based on the 
formula to find the area of a trapezoid: take the sum of its basis, multiply the sum by [CONTACT_664932], and the divid e the results by 2.  
Therefore, the VAS -AUC in mm/day will be:  
J−1

8. Efficacy  Analysis  
 
This study will examine the efficacy of SENS -[ADDRESS_898172] VI -VAS, and nausea intensity VAS will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model for the mITT population.  
 
8.1. Primary Efficacy  Analysis  
 
The standing VI -VAS will be summarized using descriptive statistics of absolute values and 
changes from baseline at each mapped time point, and of the AUC including the length of the 
AUC observation period. Each VAS assessment will be mapped to a time point as follows:  
 
Time point 
(mapped value)  VAS assessment time 
since baseline (hours)  
12 hours  6 (excluded) to 18 (included)  
24 hours  18 (excluded) to 30 (included)  
36 hours  30 (excluded) to 42 (included)  
…  
 
When more than one VAS assessment fall within the same time window, then only the VAS 
assessment closest to the middle point will be assigned to the time point. In case of values that 
are equidistant to the middle point, the latest assessment only will be assigned to the time point.

 VAS assessment not mapped to time point will not be included in the summary statistics and in 
the MMRM analysis.  
 
The VI -VAS AUC will be compared between treatment groups within an analysis of covariance 
model (ANCOVA) with the stratification factor duration of vertigo (≤24 hours, >24 hours befo re 
being treated) and the baseline VI -VAS as covariates. The two comparisons to placebo (SENS - 
111 at 100 mg vs placebo, and SENS -111 at 200 mg vs placebo) will be tested for superiority at 
5% one -sided significance level, the corresponding 90% two -sided c onfidence intervals will be 
presented. In addition the pool of the two active doses (SENS -111 at 100 mg and SENS -111 at 
200 mg) will also be tested for superiority at 5% one -sided significance level, and the 
corresponding 90% two -sided confidence interval will be presented.  
A sensitivity analysis using the date/time of the first dose intake of randomized study drug as the 
time reference for the AUC calculation will also be performed. In this analysis, the baseline will 
be defined as the last observation rec orded in the ePRO until the time of the first dose intake and 
the AUC calculation will conducted as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS] (using all VAS assessments 
between baseline and baseline + 102 hours). This analysis will be conducted on the mITT and 
the PP res tricted to subjects for whom the baseline standing VI -VAS based on first study drug 
intake is available and ≥ [ADDRESS_898174] baseline VI -VAS scores at mapped time points (12h, 24h, 36h, 48h, 72h, 84h, 96h) will 
be analyzed, without replacement of missing values,  using a restricted maximum likelihood 
(REML) based repeated measures approach. The same analysis using baseline and mapped time 
points both defined with reference to time of first dose intake will be applied on the mITT and 
the PP restricted to subjects f or whom the baseline standing VI -VAS based on first study drug 
intake is available and ≥ 60 mm.  
Analyses will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, time, and treatment -by-time 
interaction, as well as the binary stratification factor (duratio n of vertigo before being treated) 
and the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline VI -VAS and baseline score -by-time interaction.  
An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors. If this 
analysis fails to converge, sim pler structures (e.g. first -order ante -dependent or heterogeneous 
compound symmetry structures) will be tested in a model without treatment effect; the 
covariance structure converging to the best fit, as determined by [CONTACT_100830]’s information criterion, 
will b e used in the full model. Only the final model will be included in the report.  
The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. 
Within this model the test of interest will be the treatment -by-time interaction perform ed at 
significance level of 5%. In a second step, the 2 comparisons to placebo will be tested at each 
time at 5% one -sided significal level and the corresponding 90% two -sided confidence intervals 
will be presented.

8.2.1.  Worst spontaneous vertigo intensity over the [ADDRESS_898176] will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
at the following visits: baseline, end of treatment (D5), end of study (D28).  
The change from baseline of the total score of the Romberg tests at the end of treatment visit 
(D5) will be compared between treatment groups within an analysis of covariance model.  
Patients without data available at the end of treatment will be excluded from the analysis. The 
covariates will be the stratification factor, duration of vertigo (≤24 hours, >24 hour s) before 
being treated and the baseline total score. The 2 comparisons to placebo will be tested at 5% one - 
sided significance level, the corresponding two -sided 90% confidence interval will be  presented.  
The same approach will be applied to the change fr om baseline at the end of study (D28).

The DHI total score and subscores will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765].  
The change from baseline of the DHI functional subscore scale at the end of study (D28) will be 
compared between treatment groups using the approach des cribed in Secti on 8.2.3 for the 
Romberg tests. Patients without data available at the end of study will be excluded from the 
analysis. The 2 comparisons to placebo will be tested at 5% one -sided significance level, the 
corres ponding two -sided 90% confidence interval will be presented.  
The VADL total score and subscores at the end of the study (D28) will be described using

8.3. Exploratory Efficacy  Analysis  
 
8.3.1.  The caloric  test 
 
The caloric test at baseline and end of study visit (D28) will be performed in some centers 
participating in an ancillary study. The total response (TR), i.e. the absolute sum of all 
appropriately directed responses, and the relative vestibular reduction (RVR) will be analyzed 
using descr iptive summaries for each visit.

 13.2. Planned Listing  Descriptions  
 
The following are planned data and patient/subject data listings for protocol 2.0. Data listings 
will be numbered according to the nomenclature used to support the CSR when the 
xxxxxxxxx h CSR template is used. However, the listing numbering structure  can be modified 
per the sponsor’s request to meet compatibility with the sponsor’s CSR template.  
In general, one listing will be produced per CRF domain. All listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_3148], 
site, and subject number. All calculated variables will be included in the listings.  
In all listings a blank line will be placed between each subject. Within a data listing, if an item 
appears line after line (eg, repetition of subject number), then only the first occurrence will be 
displayed.  
In data listings, the information for one subject will be kept on one page if at all possible, rather 
than splitting a subject’s information across pages.

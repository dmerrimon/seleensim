Senile  Purpura  is a benign common condition characterized by [CONTACT_585625]. Other names of this condition are 
Bateman  purpura, named after British  dermatologist Thomas Bateman, who first described it in 1818, 
and actinic  purpura, because of its association with sun damage  (1). 
More recently in 2007, K aya and Saurat coined the term dermatoporosis to describe the chronic 
cutaneous fragility of aging skin. Dermatoporosis features include thinning atrophic skin, purpura, skin 
lacerations and delayed healing (2).  
This condition affects over 10% of those age d over 65  years old and is equally common in males and 
females . Risk factors  are known to include  the use of  oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_585602]-coagulants  
(3). 
With age and sun damage, the dermis becomes thin. As a result, this condition results from superficial 
vessels tearing even with negligible trauma. The subsequent extravasation of blood into the 
surrounding  dermis  results in the development of ecchymosis. Histologically, the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_585603], as well as extravasated red blood cells (4).    
Intense  pulsed  light  (IPL) is  non-coherent, non -collimated, p olychromatic  light  energy . IPL emits  different 
wavelengths that target specific chromophores. This makes IPL a versatile therapy with many 
applications, from the treatment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_585604]. 
Its large sp ot size ensures a high skin coverage rate and ease of use over large areas. The treatment has 
very little downtime given its non -ablative nature which makes it an attractive option. In many cases, IPL 
is similar to laser therapy in effectiveness, convenien ce, and safety and together with its versatility will 
lead to an expanded range of applications and possibilities in the future.  
Relevant Clinical Research  
 
Published studies on treatments for senile or actinic purpura or dermatoporosis are very limited. In one 
small double blinded study (N=14) published in 1995 in The Archives of Dermatology, they showed twice 
daily treatment with retinoic acid cream resulted in significant reduction in Bateman’s actinic purpura 
after two weeks, however there were no signi ficant differences after that time (6). 
Multiple studies have shown the efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_585605] 2016 showed not only 
an increased thickness in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_585606] -regulated genes for Collagen Type 1 (COL1A1) and 
Collagen Type 3 (COL3A1) with corresponding increases in procollagen 1 and procollagen 3 protein 
expression  (7). 2.1 BACKGROUND INFO RMATIO N  2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION  AND  SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
 
  A very small study (N=6) on the effectiveness of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_585607] 15 to 2.3 ( 8). 
More recently in 20 17, Ceilley published his experience with DerMend in the Journal of Cllinical and 
Aesthetic Dermatology, reviewing why he thought a topi[INVESTIGATOR_585608], Alpha hydroxyl 
acids, Arnica oil, Ceramindes, Niacinamide, and Phytonadione would be an op timal treatment for this 
condition (3).   
The current literature supports the  ability of IPL to induce collagen neogenesis. Studies  on mice showed 
that IPL treatments significantly increased the number of collagen and elastic fibers within the dermis 
and i mproved the parallel distribution of collagen fibers in relation to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. These results were 
only evident after three IPL treatments spaced [ADDRESS_770161] one or two treatments 
(5).  In a study with rats, IPL increased dermal col lagen fibers and collagen fiber diameter after 3 weeks 
(9) and in another study on rats, IPL increased dermal thickness, density of collagen, the hydroxyproline 
content, and the expression of III procollagen mRNA (18).  In one study in humans, [ADDRESS_770162] treatments (19). The current 
literature not only supports the  ability of IPL to induce collagen neogenesis  but also microneedling and 
microneedling with radiofrequency. One study  showed microneedling resulted in greater skin and 
dermal thickness than IPL and increased expression of Type 1 collagen and total collagen content (20).  
In Patrick Bitter’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_585609] 2015 in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, they used 3 '-end 
sequencing for expression quantification ("3 -seq") to discover the gene expression associated with 
human skin aging and the impact of broadband light (BBL) treatment. In the study skin aging was 
associated with a significantly altered expression of 2 ,265 coding and noncoding RNAs, of which 1,293 
became "rejuvenated" after BBL treatment (more similar to expression levels in youthful skin). 
Rejuvenated genes (RGs) included several known key regulators of organismal longevity  (16). Hence, 
according to th is study, BBL treatment appears to be able to restore gene expression pattern of photo 
aged and intrinsically aged human skin to resemble young skin and therefore may be an ideal treatment 
option for senile or actinic purpura.  
In addition, though most cos metic surgeons and injectors have seen firsthand the improvement of post 
procedural bruising with both pulse dye lasers or intense pulse light lasers, there are limited published  
studies on this topic. One study published in the Archives of Plastic Surger y in 2009 showed pulsed -dye 
laser was effective for treating ecchymoses after facial cosmetic procedures and resulted in a 63% mean 
improvement in ecchymosis scores within 48 to 72 hours ( 14), however there are no published studies 
to date using IPL.  
 
 
 
The current treatments of senile or actinic purpura include oral arnica, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_585610], vitamin K, 
retin -A, retinol, growth factors, alpha hydroxyl acids, ceramides, and niacinamide.  However, all of these 
have very limited results, if any, and there have been no large -scale studies proving their long -term 
efficacy for this condition.   2.2 RATIONALE  
 
  If broadband light (BBL) is used to reduce photo -damage, decrease post -procedural purpura, is 
associated with a significantly altered expression of RNAs similar to that in youthful skin, and has been 
reported to increase collagen production and epi[INVESTIGATOR_585611], then it follows that this treatment 
may be an ideal option for reduction of senile purpura.  
 
 
 
Common potential risks  of BBL include swelling, pain, scabbing, blistering, reduction of hair and 
lentigenes, erythema, pruritus, lightening and darkening of the skin, and reactivation of herpes 
infection.  Rare but potential risks  of BBL  include severe burn, skin ulceration, scarring and infection.  
Common potential risks of a skin biopsy include bleeding and scarring while rare but potential risks 
include infection and allergy to the lidocaine, bandages, or sutures used in the procedure.  
 
 
 
Improvement of the subject’s ecchymoses  leading to an aesthetic improvement. This aesthetic 
improvement may positively impact the subjects’ psychological well -being. In addition, the treatment 
may lead to less skin tears  by [CONTACT_585626][INVESTIGATOR_585612], 
infection risk, and scarring.

• Sciton’s BBL, Joule Platform  
 
 
 
The Sciton BBL as described in the 510(k) summary for the Joule multi -platform system on which it is 
located, is described as a laser surgical instrument for use in general and plastic surgery and in 
dermatology. One of the  intended use s is described as the treatment of vascular lesions . We are 
therefore using this device as per indication since a vascular lesion is a lesion r elating to, affecting, or 
consisting of a vessel or vessels, especially those that carry blood and purpura is a le sion relating to 
the injury of blood vessels in which blood escapes into the surrounding skin. We will mainly be using 
the 560 and 590 cut off filters since these are the recommended filters to treat vascular lesions.  
 
 
   
• The BBL treatment will take approximately 15 minutes  
• The last treatment will be done on Day 21

Serious adverse event or serious suspected  adverse reaction . 
 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5183] o f existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcome s listed in this definition.

7 ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
7.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIO[LOCATION_003]DVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
7.1.3  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  (UP)  
 
  Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the parti cipant 
population being studied ; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_341034]);  and 
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized. [4]  
 
With these events the following will occur:  
• Modification of inclusion or exclusion criteria to mitigate the newly identified  risks  
• Implementation of additional safety monitoring  procedures  
• Suspension of enrollment of new participants or halting of study procedures for 
enrolled participants  
• Modificat ion of informed  consent  documents  to include  a description  of newly  recognized  risks  
• Provision of additional information about newly recognized risks to previously 
enrolled participants . 
 
7.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE  EVENT
  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s 
daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interferenc e with  
functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.  
 
 
 
All AEs will have their relationship to study agent or study participation assessed.  
Evaluation of relatedness will consider etiologies such as natural history of the underlying disease, 
concurrent illness, concomitant therapy, study -related proced ures, accidents, and other external 
factors.   
 
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event will be reported. All AEs must have 
their relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product will always be suspect. 
To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
7.2.1  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
7.2.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY  AGENT  
 
   
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
agent and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to s uggest a causal 
relationship between the study agent and the  AE. 
• Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent 
caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, 
or an alternate etiology has been  established.   
 
 
 
The primary investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or 
unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event 
is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study agent.  
 
  7.[ADDRESS_770181] 
questionnaires.  
 
 Information to be collected on al AE or SAE includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to  study product, and time of resolution/stabilization of the 
event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as  
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at 
any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collect ion 
system throughout the study.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the 
event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and durati on of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The primary investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 14 days (for SAEs) after the last study 
intervention. At each study visi t, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since 
the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
7.2.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
   
  7.4 REPORTING  PROCEDURES
  
 
The IRB will receive notification of any UP, AE, or SAE within 24 hours of discovery by [CONTACT_125137].  
 
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to 
be chronic or the adherence to be stable. The pr imary investigator will be responsible for notifying 
FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but 
in no case later than 7 calendar days after the investigator’ s initial receipt of the information.  
 
 
 
If it is discovered that a subject is pregnant, the subject will discontinue any interventions and 
continue in the study while continuing safety follow -up until the conclusion of her pregnancy.  
 
  7.5 STUDY  HALTING  RULES
  
 
Administration of the study agent will be halted when two SAEs determined to be related  
are re ported . The primary investigator will inform the FDA of the temporary halt and the 
disposition of the study.  
 
  7.6 SAFETY OVERSIGHT & CLINICAL MONITORING
  
 
An independent medical expert (medical monitor) will advise the study investigator and monitor 
participant safety. The role of the Medical Monitor is to 1) Review all AEs on a regular basis 
throughout the trial; 2) be available to advise the i nvestigators on trial -related medical questions or 
problems, and 3) evaluate cumulative participant safety data and make recommendations 
regarding the safe continuation of the study. The Medical Monitor will remain blinded throughout 
the conduct of the cli nical trial unless un -blinding is warranted to optimize management of an 
adverse event or for other  
 
safety reasons. Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of 
human  
subjects are protected, that the reported trial d ata are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that 
the conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with 
GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).

  8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
 
Primary Endpoint  
 
𝐻0:µ𝐶=0  ;   𝐻1:µ𝐶>0 
 
➢ The null hypothesis is the absolute mean difference in the change from baseline to [ADDRESS_770182] treatment on the treatment arm as compared to the non -treatment arm is zero.  
➢ The alternative hypothesis is the absolute mean change  from baseline to [ADDRESS_770183] will be used to analyze the primary endpoint.   The results of the 
statistical analysis will be presented as an odds ratio with 95% Confidence intervals. A  
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk Test will be used to  assess the normality of data.  
   8.3   ADDITIONAL SUB GROUP ANALYSIS  
The primary and secondary endpoint will be analyzed based on age, sex, race/ethnicity or other 
variable such as subjects behavior ( smoking , diet, handedness, exercise, etc..)  
 
8.4   SAMPLE SIZE  
N/A – Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]

In order to avoid bias, the subjects will be randomized to receive treatment on either their left or 
right arm. All evaluators of pi[INVESTIGATOR_585616].   In 
order to avoid bias, the evaluator will not be the primary investigator.  
To ensure only the clinical investigator performing the procedures and the study coordinator know 8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
ENROLLMENT/ RANDOMIZATION/ MASKING PROCEDURES  
 
 
  the assignment of arms , each subject will have an envelope assigned to them to be held by [CONTACT_585631]’s name [CONTACT_585635]. Only during 
treatments does the study coordinator allow the clinical investigator to see the inside of the 
envelope.  
 
The skin biopsy samples will be coded t o ensure blinded analysis.  
 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_770184]
  
 
 The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for 
the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR 
Part 56, and the ICH E6.  
 
 
9.2 INFORMED CONSENT  PROCESS
  
 
Informed consent is required for all participants. In obtaining and documenting informed consent, 
the investigator will comply with applicable regulatory requirements and will adhere to 45 CFR Part 
46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and ICH GCP. Prior to the written informed consent, the consent 
forms will be provided to the participants. Consent forms describing in detail the study agent, study 
procedures, and risks will be given to the participant and written documentation of informed 
consent is required  prior to starting intervention/administering study product.  
 
The investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that 
may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehe nsion 
of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 
participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and 
ask questions prior to signing. The participants will have the opportunity to think about being a 
participant prior to agreeing to sign. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior 
to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at 
any time thro ughout the course of the trial. A copy of the informed consent document will be given 
to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by 
[CONTACT_585632].  
 
9.[ADDRESS_770185] by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and 
the sponsor(s) and their agents. Ther efore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other 
information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the 
data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the 
sponsor.  9 ETHICS/PROTECTION  OF  HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
   
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor, representatives of the IRB or 
pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records required 
to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records for the 
participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.

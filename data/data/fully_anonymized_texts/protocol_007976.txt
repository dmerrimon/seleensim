Objectives Acute  Pain:  
● To determine the effect of genotype- guided therapy  on pain control  and use 
of DEA schedule  II opi[INVESTIGATOR_380458]-surgical participants  
 
Chronic Pain:  
● To determine the effect of genotype- guided therapy on pain control in 
chronic pain participants  
 
Depression:  
● To determine the effect of genotype- guided selection and dosing of  
antidepressants on control of depression in participants with ≥3 months of  
depressive symptoms who require  new or revised therapy  
 
All Trials:  
● To determine the effect of genotype- guided therapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  
antidepressants, and optional additional, CPIC gene- drug pairs on overall  
well-being  
● To determine the effect of genotype- guided therapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],

healthcare utilization  
 
 
 
Study  Design  ADOPT PGx is comprised of three separate trials, Acute Pain, Chronic Pain, and 
Depression. Each trial is a prospective, multicenter, two arm randomized pragmatic  
trial. For all trials, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to immediate pharmacogenetic testing and genotype- guided therapy (Intervention arm) or 6- 
month delayed testing on participants receiving standard care (Control arm). In each trial, the primary outcome comparison will be between the intervention group (i.e. immediate testing) and control group (i.e. delayed testing) in the subset of  
participants  with actionable phenotypes,  within  each study.  
 
 
Rationale for Study  
Design  Pain and depression are conditions that impact substantial proportions of the US  
population and have challenges associated with identifying the right therapy while  
minimizing adverse effects or opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827]. There is evidence that both opi[INVESTIGATOR_380459] (PGx) data based on existing guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC).  Using such an approach,  a recent  single  site Pragmatic 
Clinical  Trial (PCT)  demonstrated that among CYP2D6 poor (PM)  and intermediate  
 
Page 20 of 72   metabolizers (IM), there was greater improvement in pain control in the genotype- 
guided arm compared to usual care arm[1]. Similarly, existing studies of PGx  
tailored antidepressant therapy suggest that the genotype- guided approach is  
superior to usual care in remission and/or response rates, however these studies  
are small and often industry -sponsored.  
 
A broader  trial is needed to determine the importance of PGx testing and genotype  
guided therapy for improving symptom management (i.e. pain control or control of  
depression symptoms), DEA schedule II opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], well -being, and overall  
healthcare utilization.

Page 21 of 72  Description of  
implementation of  
intervention (e.g., The intervention for ADOPT PGx is the immediate return of PGx testing results to 
the participant’s  healthcare provider.  
 
dose, schedule,  etc.) The PGx testing is comprised of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments  
(CLIA) validated, panel -based genetic testing of two required genes, CYP2D6 and 
CYP2C19. The resulting CYP2D6 genotypes will be converted to enzymatic  
activity scores and the activity scores converted to metabolizer phenotypes after  
also taking strong and moderate CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor drug interactions into account.  The CYP2 C19 genotypes  will be converted  to metabolizer phenotypes.  
 
The results of the PGx test will be returned to the healthcare providers using standard site- specific laboratory return of results methods, a static report with both 
interpretation and recommendations, and where possible, interruptive clinical  
decision support (CDS) alerts within the electronic healthcare system. Both the 
static report and interruptive alerts will guide health care providers towards  
medications best suited to the  participant.

safe and effective drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_380468]. In the case of treatment for acute 
and chronic pain, the challenge is finding effective therapy while minimizing adverse effects or opi[INVESTIGATOR_103583] (and the ensuing consequences). For depression, there are few clinically relevant predictors  
of successful treatment leading to multiple trials of inadequate therapy for some patients. Both opi[INVESTIGATOR_380469] (PGx) data based on existing 
guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). A pi[INVESTIGATOR_380470] -1, in patients with chronic pain supports the potential benefit of a genotype- 
guided approach to pain therapy.[1] Existing studies of tailored antidepressant therapy are small and often industry -sponsored but suggest the genotype- guided approach is superior to usual care. We 
propose a randomized pragmatic clinical trial that enrolls patients into three PGx -guided therapy  
scenarios: acute post -surgical pain, chronic pain, and depression. For each scenario, participants will  
be randomized to genotype- guided drug therapy versus usual approaches to drug therapy selection 
(hereafter referred to as usual care). Changes in patient reported outcomes representing pain and depression control using standard PROMIS scales define the primary endpoints. Secondary analyses  
include safety endpoints, changes in overall well -being, and economic impact represented by  
[CONTACT_380556].  
Background and Significance  
Acute  and chronic pain represents  the most  prevalent and expensive public health condition in the U.S.,  
affec ting an estimated 100M Americans with annual costs to society estimated at $635B dollars.[2, 3]  
This exceeds the combined costs of cancer, AIDS and heart disease.[3] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_380471] a mainstay of treatment for chronic pain, yet analgesic responses to opi[INVESTIGATOR_380472].[4, 5] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_380473] 1999, with 65 in 100 
people getting an opi[INVESTIGATOR_380474] 2016, and nearly 215M opi[INVESTIGATOR_380475].[6, 7]  
Nearly half of all opi[INVESTIGATOR_380476], and approximately 35% are from  
surgeons.[8]  
 
Tramadol, codeine, hydrocodone, and oxycodone comprise the vast majority of opi[INVESTIGATOR_380477] U.S.[9] Codeine and tramadol are dependent on bioactivation by [CONTACT_2750]2D6 enzyme to morphine and O -desmethyltramadol, respectively, which have 200- fold greater affinity for the µ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_380478]. CYP2D6 genotype has important relevance for response to codeine and 
tramadol. Specifically, 5- 10% of individuals are poor metabolizers (PMs), with no active CYP2D6 
enzyme secondary to frameshift mutations (*3, *6), splicing defects (*4), or complete gene deletion (*5).  
As a result, PMs are unable to generate the active metabolites of codeine and tramadol and may derive no pain relief from these drugs.[10] Another 2- 11% are intermediate metabolizers (IMs), with  
significantly impaired enzyme activity secondary to having both a nonfunctional and a reduced function 
CYP2D6 allele and may derive little pain relief from codeine and tramadol. At the opposite extreme,  
approximately 1- 2% of individuals are ultra- rapid metabolizers (UMs) with CYP2D6 gene 
duplication/multiplication.  UMs are at increased risk for  toxic concentrations of  active  opi[INVESTIGATOR_380479], with reports of life- threatening toxicity and death with codeine or tramadol.[11- 15] 
Hydrocodone and oxycodone undergo similar metabolism via CYP2D6 to compounds with 10- to 40- 
fold higher receptor affinity, respectively, and recent data support CYP2D6 genotype as an important  
contributor  to hydrocodone efficacy, though risk exists for both drugs in those with UM phenotypes.[1]  
Page 28 of 72  Guidelines support CYP2D6 genotype- guided use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], but this is rarely done in clinical 
practice.[10] In a single center PCT[1], CYP2D6 genotype- guided prescribing led to improved pain 
control in PMs and IMs compared to a traditional pain management approach. We now propose a multi - 
center  PCT in which  we will make  recommendations  based on CYP2D6  genotype and CYP2D6  
enzyme inhibitor drug interactions that can convert individuals to PM or IM phenotypes. In PM, IM and 
UM we will recommend avoidance of hydrocodone, tramadol and codeine, and for normal metabolizers  
(NM), tramadol will be recommended as the preferred opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], given its opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_380480].[16, 17] One study suggested the potential for abuse 
and dependence with tramadol in patients with chronic non- cancer pain was significantly  less than for  
hydrocodone,  and not different  from that of non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_76942].[16]  
 
The prevalence of major depressive disorder ranges from 5 to 10% in primary care, and it can be as  
high as 37% after critical care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137655].[18] SSRI prescriptions have increased 5.8-fold between 1991 and 2011.[19] Response to SSRIs and other antidepressants depends on 
numerous factors, but pharmacokinetic adjustments based on drug- drug interactions, renal and hepatic  
function, and pharmacogenomic variants within CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 play a substantial role in 
interindividual  drug response.[20]  
 
Existing clinical trials of PGx -guided treatment of depression have been primarily industry -sponsored 
and often investigate proprietary treatment algorithms.[21] One open label, non- randomized study  
demonstrated significantly improved depression outcomes in 227 adults with major depressive disorder  
(MDD) treated with PGx -guided prescribing of psychotropic medications relative to unguided 
participant s.[22] Another 12- week randomized, double- blind trial of 144 adults with MDD receiving PGx - 
guided prescribing reported a 2.52- fold greater chance of remission of depressive symptoms. A  
randomized clinical trial of 685 adults with anxiety and depression identified significantly improved outcomes relative to controls in patients diagnosed with depression or anxiety using pharmacogenetic - 
guided medication selection.[23]  A meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials of pharmacogenetic  
tests and depressive symptom remission concluded that individuals receiving treatment of depression with pharmacogenetic -guided decision support tools were 1.71 (95% CI: 1.17- 2.48; p = 0.005) times  
more likely to achieve symptom remission relative to individuals who receive treatment as usual.[24]  
Another industry -sponsored, randomized, double- blind prospective trial with only 51 study subjects (26 
pharmacogenetic -guided versus 25 unguided) reported a trend toward improved clinical outcomes in a 
10-week trial. PGx -guided participants with depression had greater than double the likelihood of  
response and remission. Mean percent improvement in depressive symptoms was higher for the PGx - 
guided group over Treatment as Usual (TAU). PGx -guided treatment doubled the likelihood of respo nse 
in patients with treatment resistant depression.[25] A more recent double- blind randomized controlled 
trial of 316 adults with MDD failed to report a difference in sustained response within a 12- week period.  
However, the PGx -guided treatment group had a higher responder rate compared to treatment as  
usual.[26]  
 
While the above clinical trials suggest improved depression outcomes with use of pharmacogenomic - 
guided management of psychotropic medications when treating major depression in outpatient  
psychi atric practices, the majority of the trials were small and sponsored by [CONTACT_45655]. Importantly, a 
large, definitive trial with non- proprietary drug selection algorithms has not yet been published. Three of  
the six most commonly used SSRIs (sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram) require functional  
CYP2C19  enzyme  activity for their  hepatic inactivation in vivo, and CPIC  recommends dose  reduction 
in the setting of a CYP2C19 poor metabolizer phenotype (to reduce probability of side effects) and alternative drug in the setting of a CYP2C19 ultra- rapid or rapid phenotype (to reduce the probability of  
pharmacotherapy failure).[27] Two additional common antidepressants (fluvoxamine, paroxetine) are 
oxidized  by [CONTACT_097]2D6,  one of the most  polymorphic of all human enzymes.  For the present  investigation,

2.2 Aims  and Objectives  of the Study  
Our rationale for examining a genotype- guided approach to acute and chronic pain management is  
based on the importance of CYP2D6 for the bioactivation of tramadol, codeine, and hydrocodone and 
data from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_380481]/PMs in the genotype -guided arm who are 
taking these drugs at baseline. Similarly, the rationale for examining a genotype- guided approach to 
depression medication therapy is  based  on the demonstrated role of  CYP2D6  in the bio inactivation 
and CYP2C19 oxidation of select, commonly used SSRIs.  Secondly, data from industry sponsored 
trials support  the hypothesis of  improved symptom  control  in a genotype- guided arm. 
 
Acute Pain:  Determine if a genotype- guided approach to acute post -surgical pain therapy leads to 
improved  pain control  compared to usual  care,  as defined by a decrease in the SIA score. Secondarily,  
we will evaluate whether this approach leads to reduced use of DEA Schedule II opi[INVESTIGATOR_380482].  
 
Chronic Pain:  D etermine if a genotype- guided approach to pain therapy in participants with at least 3 
months of chronic pain leads to improved pain control compared to usual  care.  
 
Depression:  Determine if genotype- guided dosing or selection of antidepressants  among participants  
with at least 3 months of depressive symptoms who require new or revised antidepressant therapy  
leads to improved control of  depression,  compared to usual care.

4. Study  Arms  & Design  
This is a prospective, multicenter, subset analysis of 1:1 randomized Intervention (immediate PGx  
testing and genotype- guided opi[INVESTIGATOR_380484]) vs. Control (usual  
care with delayed PGx testing) pragmatic, open label clinical trial (Figure 1). The three trials are 1)  
genotype- guided opi[INVESTIGATOR_380485] -surgical acute pain participants (Acute Pain, Figure 1A), 2)  
genotype- guided opi[INVESTIGATOR_380486] (Chronic Pain, Figure 1B), and 3)  
genotype- guided SSRI therapy in participants with depression (Depression, Figure 1C). Trial -specific  
outcomes will be compared between participants in the intervention arm and control arms who have an 
actionable phenotype. Actionable phenotypes are defined as CYP2D6 IM and PMs (i.e. CYP2D6 activity score ≤ 0.75) for the acute pain and chronic pain trials and CYP2C19 UM, RM and PMs or  
CYP2D6  UM and PMs for the depression trial.

Page 32 of 72  4.1 Randomization  
After participants provide informed consent/assent, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation to 
the Intervention (i.e. immediate PGx testing and genotype- guided opi[INVESTIGATOR_380487]) and Control (i.e. usual care with delayed PGx testing) arms. Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_380559] a random block size within each site or clinic. We anticipate variability in patient populations between recruiting sites or clinics and aim to balance the intervention 
assignments within the site or clinic unit.  Additionally, the randomization for the chronic pain trial will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_102924]/absence of depression, and the randomization for the acute pain and depression 
trials will be stratified  by [CONTACT_380560]/adult.  
 
The randomization scheme will be generated by [CONTACT_89813]. Randomization assignments  
will be generated in real time in REDCap  at the Coordinating Center.  
 
4.2 Blinding  
ADOPT  PGx randomization assignments will not be blinded to the participants  or their providers  but will 
be masked to the UF call center personnel who may be administering some of the participants follow - 
up surveys. Due to the nature of the intervention, it is impossible to completely mask participants and 
providers from the pharmacogenetic testing and return of results, hence participants, providers, and local study personnel will not be blinded. While the UF call center personnel administering follow -up 
surveys will be masked from the results and randomization, study -arm specific questions in the final (6 
month) survey may reveal study arm randomization. Additionally , participants may volunteer to reveal  
their randomization 
or PGx testing results.  If the randomization or phenotype is revealed to the call  
center,  prior to administering the 6 month surveys,  it will be documented in the database.

If a participant wishes to withdraw consent, they should contact [CONTACT_464]. A participant may also  
revoke HIPAA authorization and must provide the revocation in writing. Study staff may attempt to 
obtain a reason for withdrawal  from the participant  and record  it in the study  database.  
 
In th e  acute pain trial, the principal  investigators  or clinical  site investigators  may withdraw  a participant  
from the study  for any of these reasons:  
● Participant  does not have  the surgery  within  12 months of study  enrollment  
● Participant has the surgery at a healthcare system that is different from where the participant  
enrolled 
● Participant's surgery is scheduled for a date after the close of the enrollment  period for 
that clinical site  
● Participant  is unable to have  the surgery  for other  medical  reasons

Additionally, data collected from the EHR and Medicare and Medicaid claims data (see Section 9 
for details)  will be robust  to missing  data due to participants  that are lost to follow  up.

will generally be covered by [CONTACT_2299]’s insurance (if insured), and will not be covered by [CONTACT_10748].  
 
6.8 Compensation to Participants  
Participants will be reimbursed for their time and effort, prorated by [CONTACT_90142]. Sites will follow  
local policies and procedures for amount, timing of, and mechanism for issuing compensation to participants. Participants may be reimbursed for travel or parking expenses per institutional specific  
policies.

7. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
An overview  of the  study  procedures  to be followed is presented in this section.  Recruiting sites will 
receive training  on the protocol  and MOP  before site activation for enrollment.  
 
7.1 Interventions/Treatments  
The intervention, genotype- guided pain or depression therapy, is intended to reflect the practices and  
procedures  that are likely  to be implemented if PGx testing were  to be integrated into standard clinical  
practice. The intervention has two technical components: the PGx panel testing and the clinical  
decisions support/clinical recommendations for providers, described below. The participant and 
provider  facing components  of the intervention include the following:  
 
Patient  Participants  
● The return of the PGx testing results to the participant’s medical record that is analogous to  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_380490].  Participants  may discuss their results with  their provider.  
 
Providers  
● The return of PGx testing results to the participant’s provider via standard site- specific  
laboratory  return  of results methods  
● Clinical decision support will be provided to all providers, how that is provided may vary. At least  
one of the two options  below  that includes drug- drug interactions,  is required.  
a. A static report/consult note with interpretation of the genetic testing results and drug - 
drug interactions,  and treatment  recommendations  
b. W here possible, a provider prescribing alert for actionable phenot ypes, triggered when a  
relevant opi[INVESTIGATOR_380491]’s genetic  
results and/or metabolizer phenotype, the predicted phenotype (i.e. efficacy of various  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_380492]),  other  considerations, and treatment  recommendations  
 
PGx Panel  Testing 
 
For all trials, the PGx testing panel includes two required genes: CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 . The list of  
drugs with responses affected by [CONTACT_380566] 1 . Reflecting the pragmatic nature of the trial, there may be site to site variability in the 
testing of specific variants due to site- specific institutional approvals. The minimal required set of  
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6  variants are listed in  Appendix B. 
 
Table  1. Genes  to be  tested  and drugs  with CPIC  recommendations  
 
Genes Drugs  
CYP2C19  citalopram,  escitalopram,  sertraline  
CYP2D6  codeine,  oxycodone,  tramadol,  hydrocodone,  fluvoxamine,  paroxetine  
 
CYP2D6 phenotypes will be inferred based on the activity scoring system as shown in Table 2 and  
Table 3 . The activity score value of each allele ( Table 2) is added together to determine the total  
activity score for the diplotype. The activity scores are converted to phenotypes per Table 3 . The IM  
phenotype will be defined as an activity  score  of >0 to 0.75, not >0.[ADDRESS_673817] an a priori analysis plan to determine whether participants  
in the usual care arm with an activity score of >0.75 to 1 (who we will define as NM) have worse pain 
control or depressive symptoms than NMs with an activity score > 1 to 2. If an allele is duplicated, and it  
is unknown which allele is duplicated, then the AS may be a ranged number, resulting in a ranged phenotype.  If the ranged phenotype is NM-UM, the individual  will be treated clinically as  is if they were 
a UM.

Page 40 of 72  The CYP2C19 metabolizer  phenotype and the CYP2D6  metabolizer  phenotypes  and/or  activity  scores  
will be included in the PGx testing report generated by [CONTACT_25699], which is then returned to the 
provider  and deposited in the EMR,  where available.  
 
Clinical Decisions Support  / Clinical Recommendations  
 
Acute  a nd  Chronic Pain 
Standardized clinical consult notes with or without pharmacogenetics expert consultations will be generated based on the genotype- inferred  phenotype,  and in the case  of drugs including CYP2D6  
guidance,  will include  consideration of  drug interactions.  
 
For CYP2D6 , those taking concomitantly a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (as defined by [CONTACT_380569][28]) will be considered to have been pheno- converted to a PM and recommendations  
will be consistent with that for a PM. Examples of strong inhibitors include, but are not limited to:  
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], fluoxetine and paroxetine.  Moderate inhibitors include, but are not limited to:  duloxetine 
and mirabegro n and reduce CYP2D6 activity scores by 50%, and thus the inferred phenotype will be 
based on the genotype activity  score  x 0.5. Activity  scores that align with a given  phenotype, and which  
will ultimately will be based on genotype and drug interaction data, are shown in Tables [ADDRESS_673818]  significant  toxicities  
(especially respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]).[1, 29- 31] Thus, oxycodone will be a drug for which we will make 
strong recommendations  about  avoiding use in UMs.  
Using a standardized consult note/CDS or pharmacogenetics expert consultation, recommendations  
will be made to avoid tramadol, hydrocodone, or codeine in PMs, IMs, and UMs and to use an alternative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (e.g. morphine, hydromorphone) or non- opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (e.g. NSAID), as noted in Table 5.  
Consideration of tramadol as the first line opi[INVESTIGATOR_380493]. While not part of the 
primary  hypothesis,  for safety  reasons,  avoidance of oxycodone will also be recommended in UMs.  
 
Additionally, where possible, the CDS will include a provider alert for actionable phenot
 ypes, triggered  
when a relevant opi[INVESTIGATOR_380494]’s genetic results, the  
predicted phenotype,  other  considerations,  and treatment  recommendations.

Clinical decision support in the form of computerized alerts, standardized clinical consult notes, and/or  
pharmacist consultations will be generated to guide prescribers on dosing or selection of SSRIs or  
select ion of alternate antidepressants based on predicted phenotype. Recommendations on drug 
choice and starting  dose will be made  in accordance with CPIC  guidelines  and/or  FDA label  information 
for paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline, as outlined in Table 6. Drug -drug 
interactions leading to pheno- conversion will be incorporated into recommendations. For CYP2D6,  
concomitant use of a strong inhibitor (listed above) will result in a predicted phenotype of poor  
metabolizer, and the effect of concomitant moderate inhibitor (listed above) will be estimated by  
[CONTACT_380570]2D6 activity  score by  0.5.

Page 42 of 72  Context  of the intervention implementations  
Reflecting the pragmatic nature of the clinical trial, the intervention may be implemented in 
environments in which there are existing PGx testing and CDS. The PGx testing may be completed as  
part of larger, CLIA validated, PGx panel that include optional gene- drug pairs (Table 7). Additionally , 
clinical decision support may be in place for the study gene- drug pairs as well as other CPIC drug- gene 
pairs and/or  other  drugs affected by  [CONTACT_380572].

7.2 Baseline  Participant  Assessments  
All study participants will complete baseline surveys for demographics and participant reported 
outcomes (PROs) (see Table 8 for details). These data will be collected by [CONTACT_380573],  email, or  text. 
 
Baseline data will be collected for the Chronic Pain and Depression trials following consent, for the Acute pain trial,  survey  data will be collected before surgery.  The type of surgery  information will be  
collected after  the completed procedure.  
 
Participant demographics – including but not limited to age, sex, gender, race, Hispanic/Latino ethnicity  
(Yes or  no), and smoking status will be  administered at baseline as a survey.  
 
Past medical  history – A snapshot of  the participant’s  medical  history . See MOP for details.  
 
Baseline medications - Participant medications will be collected through the EHR and/or participant 
self-report. See MOP for details.  
Page [ADDRESS_673819]-intervention  data collection timing are as follows.  
 
Acute  Pain:  
● Date of surgery (intervention and control arms)  
Chronic Pain and Depression:  
● Intervention arm: When the pharmacogenetics results are returned to the provider and 
deposited in the EMR  
● Control arm: At date of DNA sample collection plus one week, where one week reflects the  
average  time from sample collection to returning the results to the EHR 
● Note: There will be variability in time the results are returned to provider and when 
genotype- guided therapy  is delivered to the participant,  time from results being available to 
the next provider -participant interaction (e.g. email, clinic visit, new prescription order, phone 
visit, etc.) will be  recorded by  [CONTACT_24355].  
 
Post intervention assessment collection may be done by [CONTACT_380574].  The center agents will be trained survey collectors*, using an IRB approved 
telephone script.  The collected survey responses will be entered into the study database.  If preferred, 
the participant will have the option to complete the study follow -up survey by a URL link sent by [CONTACT_3649] 
(to mobile  phone)  or email and captured in REDCap  database  
 
In the event  that the call center  is unable to reach a participant,  local study  coordinators  may contact  
[CONTACT_380575] -up surveys.  
 
Data  will be collected in the following timeframes*:

Page [ADDRESS_673842] appropriate for the site or study participant preference. The sample collection can 
occur  in person or by [CONTACT_380576].  
 
Once sample collection is completed, participants are randomized to a trial Control or Intervention      
arm. All DNA  sample  types and collection  processes are detailed in the MOP.  
 
 
7.5 Specimen  Transfer and Genetic  Testing  Procedures  
All collected specimens  will be clearly  marked with two patient  identifiers (CLIA  requirement).  Samples 
from the Intervention arm participants will be processed, using analytically validated PGx testing procedures (see Table [ADDRESS_673843]). For Control arm samples, designated laboratories  
will eit her extract DNA after sample receipt, and store the DNA for later analysis or store the sample 
and extract DNA after the Control participant has completed the 6- month follow -up assessment. After  
the Control participant has completed the 6- month follow -up assessment, Control Arm samples will be 
processed using analytically validated procedures.  Details of sample storage and transport will be 
presented in the MOP.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_673844] 
site-specific laboratory return of results methods, a static report/consult note with interpretation and 
treatment recommendations, and, where possible, a CDS within the EHR as described in Sections 7.[ADDRESS_673845] site- s pecific laboratory return of results  
methods, a static report/consult note with both interpretation and treatment recommendations, and,  
where possible, a just in time alert within the electronic health system. Sites will work with their  
institutional information technology departments to set up provider alerts for actionable PGx 
phenotypes when a relevant opi[INVESTIGATOR_380503]. Provider alerts will indicate the 
participant’s genetic results, the predicted phenotype (e.g. efficacy of various opi[INVESTIGATOR_380504]), and 
prescribing recommendations.  
 
Continuing on the health IT collaborative efforts  established in IGNITE I through CDSKB  
(http://cdskb.org ), all participating sites will seek to harmonize their CDS logic, recommendations, and 
provider alerts using a framework of required and optional elements for both the static report and the 
just in time alert. However, due to the pragmatic nature of the trial, the many involved research sites,  
and variations in local CDS policies, it is anticipated that there will be differences in CDS  
implementation details, but all sites will ensure that providers are alerted to the PGx test results and 
associated significance.  Details  of the alerts  will be provided in the MOP.

algorithms, site- developed algorithms, and/or manual chart abstractions. EHR query results will be 
sent to  the IGNITE PTN CC via secure data transfer and formatted for consistency across sites. 
Details for the  EHR elements and transfer  process will be provided in the MOP.  
 
7.9 Data Collection from CMS  and State Medicaid  Agencies  
 
Medicare and Medicaid claims data from CMS and state Medicaid agencies will be used to assess  
health care utilization, costs, and medications among participants covered by [CONTACT_380577]. Claims made in the period of 12 months prior to surgery (acute pain) or return of results  
(chronic pain, depression) through 6 months following those events will be collected. See Section 9

8. SAFETY  ASSESSMENT  AND  MONITORING  
ADOPT PGx  is a prospective, multicenter, subset analysis of 1:1 randomized Intervention (immediate 
PGx testing and genotype- guided opi[INVESTIGATOR_380484]) vs. Control 
(usual care with delayed PGx testing) pragmatic, open label clinical trial. It is regulated under an 
Abbreviated Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). The genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]- guided therapy is the device 
and classified as a minimal risk to the welfare of the enrolled participants. Only Adverse Device Effect 
(ADE) events suspecte d to be related to the specimen collection, laboratory assay genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_380508], and phenoconversion recommendations from the Best Practice Alerts (BPAs)/Consult notes 
will be reported to the IRB. Reportable ADEs or unanticipated Adverse Device Effect ( UADEs ) events 
including unanticipated study related deaths will be collected in the study database per IRB reporting 
policies. See the MOP for more details.  
 
The IRB reporting timeline  requirements  are: 
● Immediately (within 24 hours) upon learning of an unanticipated study -related death.  Study  
personnel will notify the IRB via phone or email by [CONTACT_1541] a brief summary of the event; then 
within  1 week (5 business days),  study  personnel  should submit  report  to IRB 
● Within  5 business days for unanticipated events  
● Within  10 business days for any other  problem or  event  
 
 
8.1 Medication  Side  Effects 
Participant reported medication side effects will be collected in the baseline and follow -up surveys. The  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_380509]: problems with sleep; nausea, gas or  
indigestion; constipation or diarrhea; and dizziness or balance problems. The SSRI medication side effects  that will be surveyed include:  fatigue,  change in weight,  GI upset,  sedation/somnolence,  anxiety,  
insomnia,  irritability/hostility, and sexual dysfunction.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_673848] of the study and guidance to ensure the safety and well -being of participants. The DSMB will  
meet semi -annually. A DSMB Charter will be developed detailing the procedures to be followed. A Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plan and a separate DSMB statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed in collaboration with the IGNITE  PTN,  IGNITE  PTN CC, and NHGRI,  and enacted  by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_673849] not been followed, the investigator believes it is in the participant’s  
best interest, or for any other reason. If specimens or data have been stored as part of the research 
study,  they too may be destroyed without  participant  consent.  
Page [ADDRESS_673850] -effectiveness data that can inform reimbursement decisions for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Reporting 
metrics will include:  
1. A verage costs for each study arm, considering overall cost to the payer and select services  
directly  relevant to the acute pain,  chronic pain,  and depression groups  
2. Differences in cost utility between the intervention arm, considering overall cost to the payer and 
select services directly  relevant  to the acute  pain, chronic pain,  and depression groups  
3. Incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER), i.e., the incremental change in cost per unit  
improvement  of effectiveness.  
All metrics will be ascertained over a 6- m onth follow -up period with the assumption that beneficial  
effects  of genotype- guided therapy  are fully realized within  this time period and that the control  arm 
participants  have  not yet developed any cross -over effects  from the 6-month  delayed testing.  
 
In a population of mixed payer  types,  collecting actual costs  for all participants  is not feasible.  
Therefore, costs will be obtained from Medicare and Medicaid claims data and imputed or cross -walked 
to the other  payer  types.  Based  on data in the National  Inpatient  Sample,  53% and 4% of knee  and 
59% and 4% of hip arthroplasties were reimbursed by [CONTACT_380578], respectively. For chronic  
pain participants, data from the University of [LOCATION_012] suggest 40% and 20% are covered by [CONTACT_380579], respectively. Thus, considering enrollment gaps, at least 60% of the study population is  
anticipated to have claims data, from which comprehensive cost analyses can be performed and extrapolated to the entire cohort. Major cost drivers associated with pain and depression will be ascertained from the participant using validated resource questionnaires, and verified through secondary  claims  data whenever  possible.  
 
9.2 Data Collection  
Data  for this specialized analysis  will come  from these  sources:  
1. Participant report of healthcare utilization (e.g. emergency department, urgent care, office) for  
all participants, these will focus on high- cost items and/or items that are expected to be 
sensitive  to the  intervention 
2. Medicare claims  data for Medicare enrollees  
3. Medicaid  claims  data for Medicaid  enrollees  
 
Participant reported visits : Participant reported assessment for health care utilization is previously  
described in section 7.3.  
Medicare claims data: For Medicare enrollees in fee- for-service (FFS) plans or Medicare Advantage,  
clinical groups will ascertain Medicare claims data (Part A -D) directly from the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid  Services  (CMS).  
Medicaid claims data: For Medicaid enrollees, clinical groups will ascertain claims data from their  
states’ Medicaid agencies  directly.  
 
To ensure full adjudication, requests to Medicare/Medicaid for claims data will be timed to occur  
between 6- [ADDRESS_673851] enrolled patient. Claims data  
will also be requested for one year  before trial enrollment  up to 6 months thereafter.  
Page 52 of 72  The procedure for obtaining claims data will require a database linkage step – mappi[INVESTIGATOR_380510]/Medicaid identifiers.  The data linkage will rely on social  security  number  (SSN)  
or Medicare ID and date of birth (DoB),  which  can be collected in two possible ways:  
1. Both SSN and/or  Medicare ID and DoB are collected as part of the trial by [CONTACT_380580] 
2. One or both variables are extracted from the medical record of the participating health center by  
a healthcare data security officer  or the local equivalent,  on behalf  of the study  team  
 
For 2020- [ADDRESS_673852] three groups:(1) Clinical Trial Participants: To achieve our 
goals to understand the effects of a genotype- guided approach, we will have all Medicare beneficiaries 
who participated in the ADOPT PGx  clinical trial and enrolled in the trial. (2) Controls - a standardized 
national cohort based on the 5% sample of beneficiaries who did not participate the clinical trial but had 
similar characteristics with beneficiaries who participate the clinical trial (received opi[INVESTIGATOR_380511]). We will further require beneficiaries to have at least [ADDRESS_673853] 2 months of FFS in the year that they received the opi[INVESTIGATOR_380512]. (3) Controls – a cohor t of 
beneficiaries from [LOCATION_012], [LOCATION_001], North Carolina, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Indiana (the states 
in which the clinical sites are located), pulled from the 100% sample, in which the beneficiaries did not participate the clinical trial but have similar characteristics with beneficiaries who participate the clinical trial received opi[INVESTIGATOR_380511]). We will further require beneficiaries to have at least [ADDRESS_673854] two groups: (1) Clinical Trial Participants: we will have all 
Medicaid beneficiaries who participated in the ADOPT PGx  clinical trial and enrolled in the trial. (2) 
Controls- a cohort of beneficiaries from [LOCATION_012], [LOCATION_001], North Carolina, Tennessee, South Dakota, 
and Indiana (the states in which the clinical sites are located), in which the beneficiaries did not 
participate the clinical trial but have similar characteristics with beneficiaries who participate the clinical trial received opi[INVESTIGATOR_380511]). We will further require beneficiaries to have at least [ADDRESS_673855] information is unavailable.  
 
Costs  i
mputation  
The Medicare/Medicaid (M/M) claims will be used to impute healthcare utilization and costs for  
participants who are enrolled in other plans or not insured as follows. First, the subset of the study  
participants with both the participant reported set of medical encounters and M/M claims data will be identified. In this subgroup, claims data and self -report data will be used to derive extrapolation factors  
for total healthcare utilization and cost across all study participants. Additionally, for participants in other  
plans or uninsured,  we will use M/M data to assign average cost to each  of the self-reported items.  
 
 
10. STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  PLAN  AND  SAMPLE SIZE  
 
10.[ADDRESS_673856],  the power  requirement  was 
set to 90%. Second, sample sizes are adjusted for a 10% drop- out (for which UF has data from several  
studies that this is a good estimate). Third, slightly smaller effect sizes than what was observed in prior  
studies was used. Finally, sample size calculations are based on an alpha of 0.049, to allow one interim 
analysis with an alpha of  0.001 in each study.  
Due to the study design and the delay in the control arm to obtaining the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_380513] a ssignment,  it is not feasible to directly  monitor the 
number of randomized participants in the actionable subgroup for the enrollment stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. Alternatively, the observed trial specific actionable phenotype percentages and the corresponding trial specific total enrollment target s will be used to identify when enrollment  can conclude for a fully 
powered mITT study .  
 
Acute  P
ain  
In the University  of [LOCATION_012]’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_380514],  the difference between study  arms  in SIA score  was 
–38.[ADDRESS_673857] size of 0.375, 304 participants with an actionable phenotype per group, 15 2 from the intervention 
arm and 152 from control  arm, are required to achieve 90% power  for a two-sided two-sample t- test. 
Preliminary data from the University of [LOCATION_012]’s acute pain study indicates the proportion of participants  
w
ith an actionable phenotype, genotypic or pheno- converted CYP2D6 IM or PM, will be approximately  
18%. After adjusting for the subset anticipated to have an actionable phenotype, 845 participants  
completing all assessments, per group, are required to achieve 90% power in the sub- group analysis  
(1678 total). Assuming 10% drop out or lost to follow -up and 7% of participants not going on to surgery,  
a total of 2020 randomized participants is required to sufficiently power this study.  Factoring in 
variability in the proportion that are IMs or PMs (15% to 24%), 1516 to 24 24 randomized subjects   would 
be need to achieve  90% power in the mITT analysis . 
 
Chronic Pain:  In the University of [LOCATION_012]’s prior chronic pain study, the difference between study arms  
in composite pain score was 0.[ADDRESS_673858] size of 0.40, 268 participants within the specified subgroup, 134 from the intervention arm and 
134 from control arm, are required to achieve 90% power for a tw o-sided two- sample t -test. Preliminary  
data indicate the proportion of participants  with an actionable phenotype will be 30-35%; 10- 15% of 
participants with an actionable genotype- based phenotype ( CYP2D6 IM or PM) and an additional 20%  
with a pheno- convert ed PM/IM based on drug- drug-gene interactions. After adjusting for the subset  
anticipated to have an actionable phenotype, 447 participants completing all assessments, per group,  
are required to achieve 90% power in the sub- group analysis (894 total). Assu ming 10% drop out or  
lost to  follow -up, a total of 994 randomized participants  is required to sufficiently  power this study.  
Factoring in variability of the proportion of  randomized population that are IMs or PMs  (24-33%) , 906 
to 1244  randomized subjects would be need to achieve 90%  power in the mITT analysis . 
 
Depression:  
In prior studies of depression, the difference between study arms in PROMIS 8a T -scores was – 6.[ADDRESS_673859] size of -.67. For the purposes of power analysis, a 4- point  
change is considered the minimally important difference representing a response to therapy that is  
congruent with the predicted CYP enzyme phenotype compared to the response to therapy which 
Page 54 of 72  conflicts with the  phenotype.  
Preliminary  dat a from published studies indicate the proportion of participants with an actionable 
phenotype (CYP2C19 PM, RM, UM or CYP2D6  PM or UM, or pheno- converted  CYP2D6  PM or UM) 
will be 40%. However, due to the distribution of study -related antidepressants in primary care and 
behavioral health settings, an estimated 67% of the participants with an actionable phenotype are 
anticipated to also have a study -related dosing or drug selection intervention. In other words, the 
analytic group of CYP2DC UM, PM, or CYP2C [ADDRESS_673860] of care arm since they are not being prescribed a study -relevant antidepressant. In accounting 
for this population mixture, we incorporated a dilution factor of 67% into the clinically meaningful effect  
size projection and assume the effective difference of 0.28, representing a 2.8- point change to the T - 
score. We will need [ADDRESS_673861] size of 0.28 with 90% power. After adjusting for the subset anticipated to have an actionable 
phenotype (i.e. 40%), 678 participants completing all assessments, per group, are required to achieve 
90% power in the mITT analysis (1356 total).  After accounting for 90% retention, 754 participants from  
the intervention arm and 754 participants from  control arm (1508  total) are required to achieve 90%  
power for a two- sided two- sample t -test. Factoring in variability for the on the mITT proportion of the 
randomized population (40-60%) , 1006-1508 randomized subjects would  be needed  to achieve 90% 
power  in the mITT analysis .

10.2 General  Statistical  Methods  
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be developed for each trial (acute pain, chronic pain, and 
Page 55 of 72  depression)  and contained in a separate document.  Prior  to analysis,  each trial study  population details,  
including the number  randomized, in each  treatment arm, and lost to follow -up will be described.  
Baseline participant characteristics will be summarized as means, standard deviations, medians, and  
25th, 75th percentiles for continuous variables, and as counts and percentages for categorical variables.  
Model assumptions will be examined prior to analysis and transformations implemented, if necessary,  
to more adequately meet the assumptions. Unless otherwise stated, hypotheses will be tested as two- 
sided with a significance level of  0.05.

In addition to the primary research exploratory analyses, we will also analyze the uptake and utilization of the clinical decision support (CDS) tools that were created and its role in any medication changes 
made by [CONTACT_380584]. We will examine the impact of the CDS tools on various primary and secondary 
outcomes. We may also describe the development of the CDS tools, with a specific focus on the 
automated phenoconversion calculations implemented by [CONTACT_365162]. As part of  these analyses, we may 
collect and/or include the following data points: socio- demographics, health care characteristics (i.e. 
comorbidities), site ID, clinical group ID, CDS related data points (i.e. alert ID, CDS name, CDS alert type, date triggered, provider action), prescriber specialty, medication details (i.e. triggering medications, medication or dose changes, medication concordance/discordance), genotype and phenoconversion results.  
 We will also analyze reach, adoption, and implementation of the trial and PGx testing. We will examine enrollment and screening information, missing data rates, visit completion information. We will also analyze patient preferences for contact [CONTACT_380585], in addition to survey completion

Healthcare costs: In the Medicare fee- for-service or Medicaid enrollees, log- transformed overall  
expenditures (between index visit and 6 months follow -up) will be compared using a 2- sample t -test 
between the study arms (after ensuring that the variances in the log- scale are equal). Alternatively, cost  
comparisons will be made using appropriate regression models such as generalized linear models. For  
all participants, regardless of insurance type, we will estimate and aggregate participant -reported 
healthcare utilization during follow -up and assign cost for each item based on unit weighted mean cost  
estimates  from the Medicare/ Medicaid data.  
 
Within the Medicare/Medicaid population, we will compare estimated cost differences between genotype- guided and usual care based on billing records versus participant report to further validate the 
cost comparisons for the entire population. Cost for the index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380519], but we will compare length of stay between groups as reference 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_380520]- based reimbursement schemes. All costs will  
be converted to 2021 $US using the chain- weighted Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI).  
 
Finally, we will compare the Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries among our trial enrollees to a larger  
random sample of beneficiaries in the participating states and compare demographic and key clinical  
characteristics to explore representativeness  of our study  sample,  evaluate the impact  of attrition  and 
loss to  follow -up and make  inferences about  the generalizability  of our results.  
 
Cost utility: For the cost -utility analysis, the PROMIS -43 responses will be converted into utilities using 
previously validated crosswalks.[41] Cost and quality adjusted life year (QALY) estimates, adjusted for  
clustering within site and baseline utility for QALYs, will be obtained using appropriate regression 
models such as generalized linear models. The analysis of maximum likelihood parameter estimates  
will allow us to capture differences in cost and QALYs between the intervention arm and control arm of  
the trial. The Incremental cost -effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated from costs and QALY. A  
bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_380521] (CI) around the ICER estimate (2.5
thand 97.5thpercentiles corresponding to the lower and 
upper bounds of the CI, respectively). This sampling uncertainty will be summarized using cost - 
effectiveness acceptability  curves.  
 
Details  of these statistical  analyses,  along  with other  exploratory  analyses will be described in the study  
SAP.  
 
10.7 Interim  Analyses 
A single  specified interim  analysis is planned for each trial. To account  for repeated significance testing  
of the accumulating data, the group sequential method of Lan and DeMets will be used as a guide for  
Page 60 of 72  interpreting this interim analysis.  Monitoring boundaries for the primary endpoint will be based on a 
two-sided symmetric O’Brien- Fleming type spending function with an overall two- sided significance 
level of α=0.05. The O’Brien- Fleming approach requires large critical values early in the study but  
relaxes (i.e.,  decreases)  the critical value as the trial progresses.  
 
Acute  P ain  
The interim analysis of the acute pain primary endpoint will compare SIA scores at [ADDRESS_673875] return  of 
PGx testing result to providers, will compare the participants with CYP2D6 PM/UM or CYP2C19 PM, 
RM and UM phenotypes in the Control arm to the participants with CYP2D6 PM/UM or CYP2C19  
PM/RM/UM  phenotypes  in the intervention arm.  
 
The primary analysis is a modified intent to treat design and the analytical subgroup is defined by [CONTACT_380586]. Because the drug metabolizer phenotypes for participants in the Control arm  
is determined around the time of the 6- month follow up assessments for all trials (Acute Pain, Chronic  
Pain, and Depression), only participants that have completed their 6- month assessments will be 
included in the interim analysis. To account for the delays in receiving genetic testing results, the 
interi m analysis will be targeted to occur when approximately 50% of the participants have completed 
their 6- month assessments.  If the interim  analysis does not  propose stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303]  (p-value  
<0.0003 and the intervention has the larger reduction in the primary endpoints), then the conditional  
power  to detect  a significant  result at  the end of the trial will be estimated.  The conditional  power will  be 
presented to the DSMB  to facilitate  discussion  of whether  the trial should be stopped  for futility.

could be "significant" by [CONTACT_3364]. Adjusting for the effects of the repeated significance testing for the 
Page 61 of 72  multiplicity of secondary endpoints would require that very small significance levels be used for every  
comparison. Therefore, rather than adjusting for multiple comparisons, we will be conservative in the 
interpretation of the analyses, considering the degree of significance, and looking for consistency  
across endpoints. The nominal (unadjusted) p- value for each comparison will be reported to aid in the 
overall  interpretation.  We have  also prespecified the primary  and secondary  outcome variables  to avoid 
over-interpretation of strictly  exploratory comparisons.  
Page [ADDRESS_673877]  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_380522]: data collected from participant surveys, genetic testing results, data 
from the EHR, and CMS billing records. Data will be entered into a REDCap database maintained by  
[CONTACT_380587] -up assessments 
and by [CONTACT_380588] -up assessments. Site staff will receive training on the use of the 
REDCap  database. After staff are trained, they will receive a unique user identification and password

Laboratories will transfer genetic testing results to the IGNITE PTN CC and follow standard site- specific  
return  of results procedures  for providers.  The genotype and result (i.e.  metabolizer  phenotype)  for 
each participant will then be  imported to the participant’s study database record from  laboratory 
produced output files. The accuracy of the import of laboratory results will be verified by [CONTACT_380589] a subset of the study participants . See MOP for details.

14. APPENDICES  
 
14.1 APPENDIX A. SIA SCORE  BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
For the primary endpoint, we propose to use a composite score that captures both opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 
(MED) and pain intensity. This is based on preliminary data from a University of [LOCATION_012] (UF) pi[INVESTIGATOR_380532]2D6 genotype- guided opi[INVESTIGATOR_380533] a 
usual care approach (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]). While not powered to detect  
differences in clinical endpoints, preliminary results from [ADDRESS_673887]-surgery between genotype- guided and usual  care groups,  but significantly lower  MMEs  in 
the genotype- guided group. The combination of lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_380534]- guided arm. However, assessing opi[INVESTIGATOR_380535] -individual differences in opi[INVESTIGATOR_380536], which is why we believe a composite endpoint that integrates the two is justifiable.  
 
The Silverman Integrating approach (SIA) score has been shown to provide superior statistical power  
with appropriate control of type [ADDRESS_673888] - 
operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_174056].[1,  2] When comparing  the SIA score  between genotype- guided and 
usual care arms in the UF study described above, the score indicated lesser pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_380537]- guided arm compared with greater pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_380538] (p=0.07). To date, at least [ADDRESS_673889] - 
operative setting.[3- 13] While the majority utilized patient -controlled analgesia pumps, a pain expert at  
UF proposes the SIA score applicability warrants consideration in an acute post -surgical pain 
populati on. The SIA score is referenced in recommendations by [CONTACT_7902],  
Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT), which aims to develop consensus  
recommendations for design and execution of clinical trials of pain management [14], as well as in a systematic review of predictive experimental pain studies.[15] However, both acknowledge that the SIA  
score is rarely used in pain research and that additional research is needed on its utility.  While this  
approach is not part of current consensus recommendations for pain trials, consensus bodies have expressed interest in its utility.  Importantly, it allows us to jointly assess two important, interlinked 
parameters in the setting of acute post -surgical pain – both opi[INVESTIGATOR_380539] c ontrol.  While we could 
focus on MMEs as the primary endpoint based on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_380540], we believe that MME  
alone, without  knowing the pain control,  is difficult  to interpret  clinically,  and thus suboptimal.

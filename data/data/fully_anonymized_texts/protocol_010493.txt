 1 Introduction  
This is an investigator -initiated  application to evaluate a new prostate therapy that is 
intended to relieve the symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). There is no 
monetary support from commercial entities. The intent of the study is to evaluate the 
outcome  of prostate artery embolization for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia. This 
procedure was originally  reported from two separate groups, one in Lisbon , Portugal  and 
one in Sao Paulo, Brazil. After their initially promising data several different groups  in the 
[LOCATION_002] , Asia,  and Europe  have added there data to the literature . The study will 
use commercially available embolic ma terials, which represents a new application for 
these devices, which have been cleared for sale for other indications.  
 
2 BPH  
2.1 Introduction  
BPH is a highly prevalent condition in which there is nodular growth of prostatic tissue, 
enlarging the prostate and narrowing the urethra. BPH contributes to symptoms of 
frequency and urgency of urination in men as they age.  It is estimated that close to 80%  
of men will develop BPH.  Most men will be treatable for this condition with alpha -blockers 
or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, but close to 10% of men who develop an enlarged 
prostate will need surgery to correct symptoms  from this disorder.  The symptoms include 
frequent urinary traction infections, bladder stones, inability to urinate , and urinary 
incontinence.  
 
2.2 Signs and symptom s of Prostate Gland Enlargement  
 Weak urine stream, difficulty in starting urination  
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_211988], dribbl ing at the end of urination  
 Straining while urinating, frequent need to urinate  
 Prolonged urination  
 Urge incontinence – involuntary leakage followed by [CONTACT_165547]  
 Increased frequency of urination at night (nocturia)  
 Urgent need to urinate and not being able t o completely empty the bladder  
 Blood in the urine (hematuria)  
 Urinary tract infection  
 
2.3 Traditional management  
2.3.1  Medical  
Current medical management of BPH includes two class  of medications that target the 
dynamic and stable aspects of prostatic obstruction; α -adrenergic blockers and 5α -
reductase inhibitors respectively. The α -adrenergic blockers directly inhibit sympathetic 
tone, which relaxes the smooth muscle of the prostate.  The 5α -reductase inhibitors 
(including Finasteride) prevent conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which 
  Page [ADDRESS_253880] co -incident 
bladder dysfunction and anticholinergic medications may prove beneficial [1]. 
2.3.2  Surgical  
Surgical therapy is reserved for patients exhibiting moderate to severe symptoms not 
controlled by [CONTACT_212004].  Traditionally open prostatectomy was the surgical option of choice, but with  
onset of new surgical techniques and technologies open prostatectomy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_211989] (usually >80 -100g) prostates. Open prostatectomy may also be 
recommended when there is a concomitant bladder diverticulum or bladder stone.  
The current g old standard of medical refractory BPH  is transurethral resection of the 
prostate (TURP). This procedure focuses on resecting peri -urethral prostatic tissue, which 
is most contributory to static obstruction.  Complications of TURP include significant 
bleed ing (often requiring transfusions) , TUR syndrome (hyponatremia secondary to 
absorption of hypotonic irriga tion), retrograde ejaculation,  impotence,  and urinary 
incontinence.  Given these potentially serious adverse events, several new techniques 
have been developed  and investigated.  However , a recent systematic review noted that 
there is little evidence that any of these are more efficacious than TURP and as such it 
remains the gold standard [2]. Some of these newer approaches include transurethral 
incision of  the prostate, which is reserved for men with obstruction and a small prostate. 
This procedure is more rapid than TURP and outcomes in well -selected patients are 
equivalent to that of TURP with less morbidity from bleeding, TUR syndrome, and rate of 
retrograde ejaculation [3]. Several different protocols  using  laser surgery for the prostate 
have been described, the two main ener gy sources are Nd:YAG and holmium:  YAG. 
These procedures can be performed under direct visualization or with transrectal 
ultrasound guidance.  Laser ablation is particularly useful in patients on anticoagulation 
as the risk of  bleeding is minimal.  Similar  to other coagulative techniques, the prostatic 
urethra is not immediately excised/resected; instead it is sloughed off over the course of 
a few weeks. Studies suggest that patients undergoing Holmium laser enucleation require 
shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], expe rience decreased blood loss, and have similar outcomes to 
TURP at the expense of increased procedure time [4]. Yet, despi[INVESTIGATOR_211990], none of these technologies has been sufficiently 
effective  to displace TURP.

3.1 Pelvic Embolization  
Non-selective  hypogastric artery embolization was originally described as a management 
option for refractory hematuria in 1974 [5] and was subsequently reported in case repor ts 
as an emergency treatment for refractory hematuria secondary to BPH, adenocarcinoma 
of the prostate, and post -operative/post -biopsy bleeding [6,7]. 
Over the past [ADDRESS_253881] been published regarding embolization of pelvic tumors, incl uding prostate and 
bladder cancer, and for bleeding after transurethral resection of the prostate.  In total, 
there are 130 patients reported in the case reports and studies  [5-17]. All were pelvic 
embolizations, with a wide range of pathologies. If one lea ves out the study by [CONTACT_212005] 
[16], which included a variety of malignancies in the pelvis, all the other above cases, [ADDRESS_253882] since been performed to assess the safety and feasibility of prostatic 
embolization in animal models.  
 
Darewicz  in 1980  [19] published the  first investigation on transarterial prostatic 
embolization . Five dogs were catheterized and each internal iliac artery embolized with 
n-butyl -2-cyanoacrylate. This liquid embolic material results in complete occlusion of the 
vessels into which it is inje cted. After animal sacrifice, pathologic examination of the 
prostate tissue showed no macroscopic changes. Microscopic examination revealed 
infiltration of lymphocytes , histiocytes , and fibroblasts in the interstitial tissue. No injuries 
to other pelvic or gans were noted.  
 
Sun et al [20]  used pi[INVESTIGATOR_211991] (TAE) as a 
potential treatment for BPH. Sixteen  healthy large white male pi[INVESTIGATOR_211992]. 
Eight animals were randomly assigned  to the TAE group, and eight were randomly 
assigned to the control group. Each pig in the TAE group underwent bilateral super  
selective catheterization of the prostatic branch of the inferior  vesical artery and 
subsequent embolization with 500 –700 µm microsphere particles (Embos phere; 
Biosphere Medical, Louvres, [LOCATION_009]). Three months after the procedure, both the pi[INVESTIGATOR_211993]. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_211994], and necropsy a nd pathologic 
analysis were immediately performed with particular attention paid to the prostate. There 
was no significant difference in sexual function between the two groups. The urinary 
bladder, ureters, deferent ducts, urethra, sigmoid colon, and rectu m appeared to be 
normal in all animals. The prostate volume was significantly smaller (P <.001) in the TAE 
group than in the control group. In the TAE group pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], microsphere particles were 
identified within occluded arterioles and there was fibrotic tissue  formation and glandular

In a study of prostate embolization in canines, benign prostatic hyperplasia was induced 
using hormones in 9 beagle dogs [21]. The dogs underwent hormonal stimulation for 
either 12 or 24 weeks. Five of the 9 beagl es were embolized, in all cases with 255 -355 
µm polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles, (Contour®, [LOCATION_011] Scientific, Natick, MA). Half the 
dogs were hormonally stimulated for 12 weeks and half for 24 weeks. All animals that 
were embolized (5 of the 9) were tre ated 12 weeks after the initiation of the hormones 
and were sacrificed 12 weeks after embolization (24 weeks after baseline). In the group 
stimulated for [ADDRESS_253883]  recent  study reported in 2011, again using hormonal stimulation in 10 beagles 
for 4 months [22].  Seven of the ten were randomly selected for embolization with 300 -
500 µm tris-acryl gelatin microspheres ( TAGM ). The pathologic findings were similar to 
the study reported above. The embolized prostate glands showed gross cystic change 
and microscopic cysts lined with atrophied glands, compatible with major areas of 
glandular ne crosis. There were no bladder injuries, but two animals were found to have 
a slight adhesion between the posterior surface of the prostate and the anterior wall of 
the rectum.  No mural or mucosal injuries to the rectum were reported.  
 
Animal studies in this setting have limitations. The beagle model does not replicate human 
BPH, symptom change cannot be assessed in animals, and objective improvement of 
urinary flow also cannot be measured, as the BPH model in canines does not induce 
bladder outlet obstru ction. Also, most men who would be treated with this treatment are 
over [ADDRESS_253884] symptoms (LUTS) secondary to BPH [23].  The gross hematuria resolved 
immediately after the procedure and follow -up at 12 months demonstrated a significant 
reduction in his LUTS as measured by [CONTACT_212006] ( IPSS ) 
(24 to 13).  Further, there was a 40% reduction in prostate volume  and a decrease in

operative fever, there were no complications in that patient.  
 
In the last five yea rs there have been several small clinical trials on patients with BPH 
refractory to medical management. In Brazil, Carnevale et al. performed PAE with 300 -
500 µm TAGM on two patients with acute urinary retention secondary to BPH who were 
initially managed on α-blocker therapy and urethral catheterization [24].  One patient was 
treated with bilateral embolization while the other was unilaterally  embolized .  Preliminary 
results with 6 -month follow -up demonstra ted a 39.7% reduction on US and 47.8% 
reduction on MRI in prostate volume from baseline in the bilaterally treated patient and 
25.5% and 27.8% respectively in the unilaterally treated patient with no evidence of 
complications in either patient. Further fol low-up at 18 months demonstrated interval 
increase in prostate size as measured by [CONTACT_212007] 
(19.6% and 12.2% reduction from baseline) while the bilaterally treated patient’s prostate 
volume remained stable (39.7% and 5 3.6% reduction from baseline) relative to 6 -month 
follow -up.  Both patients reported significant improvement in their IPSS and quality of life 
(QoL) score at 18 months with the bilaterally treated patient reporting a score that 
decreased from 8 at 1 month follow -up to 1 while the unilaterally treated patient reported 
a decrease from 17 to 7 [25].  
 
This group  presented results in a total of 12 patients, including  the two discussed above, 
at the March 2012 Annual Meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology [26]. All of 
these patients had catheter dependent urinary retention. The procedure was clinically 
successful in [ADDRESS_253885] -treatment. Wh ile no major complications were noted, 3 of 12 had 
minimal rectal bleeding, 2 of 12 had diarrhea, and focal bladder ischemia in 1 of 12. Mean 
prostate volume reduction was 30% and most had significant improvement in IPSS and 
QoL scores.   
  
Finally, this group recently published results from a prospectively collected group of 35 
patients who had very large prostates (>90 g) which ranged in size from 90 -252 g [27].  
This is a subset of patients that would typi[INVESTIGATOR_211995].   They achieved 
technical success, defined as bilateral prostatic artery embolization, in 33 of 35 patients.  
In their report of 3 month follow up the mean prostate size decreased significantly  (p < 
0.001) , QoL  scores improved significantly (p < 0.001) , peak flo w rate (Qmax) increased 
significantly ( p < 0.001), and IPSS improved significantly ( p < 0.001) .  They also 
demonstrated a significant decrease in the PSA ( p = 0.002).  They did have minor 
complications in a few patients which included two cases of re ctal bleeding, two cases of 
hematosperima, one case of diarrhea, and one case of ureteral trauma secondary to 
Foley insertion.   
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_211996]. published a clinical study with 15 patients performed in Portugal in early 2011  
utilizing 200  µm non -spherical PVA particles (Cook Inc., Bloomington IN) [28].  Technical 
success, defined as selective prostatic arterial embolization of at least one pelvic side, 
was achieved in 14 of 15  patients. Bilateral embolization was achieved in 13 patients, 
unilateral in 1 and embolization failed technically in one patient on both sides due to

of IPSS by a mea n of 6.5 points (p= .005), improved QoL score by 1.14 (p=.065), an 
increase in erectile function score by 1.7 points (p=0.63), a mean decrease in PSA by 
2.27 ng/mL (p=.072), and a mean prostate volume reduction by 26.5  mL (p=.0001).  The 
authors reported a major complication in one patient that experienced severe 
intraoperative pain during embolization and was subsequently found to have a 1.5  cm2 
area of necrosis in the inferior bladder wall requiring surgical repair.  Of the 14 patients 
that were technically successfully treated, only 10 achieved clinical success (defined as 
an improvement of symptoms with an IPSS  <20 and/or improvement of Q max to greater 
than 7mL/sec).  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_211997]’s group also presented the results of 152 patients at the same SIR meeting in March 
2012 [29] with a subset of  these patients  being published  in early 2013 [30].  However, 
later in [ADDRESS_253886] patient series of 255 patients.  Of these 
patients the procedure was technically successful in 250 (98%) of patients.  The group 
presented data fo r follow up at 1 , 3, 6 , 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months for varying numbers 
of patients.  They found clinical improvement in 81.9% 80.7%, 77.9%, 75.2%, 72%, 72%, 
72%, and 72% respectively.  They also demonstrated statistically significant improvement 
of IPSS , QoL  score , Qmax, PVR, prostate volume, and PSA at all time intervals.  The 
group reported only one major complication, the  afore mentioned bladder wall ischemia.  
They reported urinary tract infections in 19 patients, transient hematuria in 14 patients , 
rectorrhagia in 6  patients, and balanitis in 4 patients.   
 
Recently, a report of early ﬁndings from a prospective [LOCATION_002] clinical trial to 
evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of PAE for BPH has been published [ 32]. 72 patients 
were screened and 20 pati ents underwent treatment. Embolization was technically 
successful in 18 of 20 patients (90%); bilateral PAE was successful in 18 of 19 (95%). 
Unsuccessful embolization were secondary to atherosclerotic occlusion of prostatic 
arteries. Clinical success was seen in 95% of patients (19 of 20) at 1 month, with average 
AUA symptom score improvement s of 10.8 points at 1 month (P=  .0001), 12.1 points at 
3 months (P =  .0003), and 9.8 points at 6 months (P = .06). Q oL scores  improved at 1 
month (1.9 points; P = .000 2), 3 months (1.9 points; P = .003), and 6 months (2.6 points; 
P = .007). Sexual function improved by 34% at 1 month (P = .11), 5% at 3 months (P = 
.72), and 16% at 6 months. (P= .19). Prostate volume at 6 months had decreased 18% 
(n = 5; P = .05). No mino r or major complications were reported.    
 
Kubatov et al  [33] also reported similarly good mid -term outcomes of 88 patients treated 
in Italy.  The y too showed a significant improvement in mean IPSS (p < 0.05), mean Qmax 
(p < 0.05), post void residual ( PVR) (p < 0.05), prostate volume (p < 0.05), and QoL score 
(p < 0.05) at [ADDRESS_253887] of different particle size (100 -
µm vs 200 -µm) on the outcome of PAE on BPH.  No significant differences were found in 
pain scores and adverse events between two groups. Whereas PSA level and PV showed

200-µm particles.  [34] 
 
Recently Wang et al published a study of 117 patients with pr ostrates >80 mL  in Chinese 
patients .  They  used 50 µm and 100 µm PVA  [35].  They were technically successful, 
defined as unilateral or bilateral prostatic artery embolization, in 109 of 117 patients.  This 
group reported outcomes at 24 months in 84 patients which demonstrated significantly 
decreased IPSS  (p < 0.001), QoL scores  (p < 0.01), Qmax (p < 0.01), PVR (p < 0.01), 
and decreased prostatic volume (p < 0.01).  Some of these patients were followed for 
longer than [ADDRESS_253888] common minor complication was urethral burning.      
 
In early 2014  a prospective trial comparing TURP to PAE was conducted and published  
which demonstrated that while initially the TURP cohort showed sig nificantly better 
improvement in IPSS, QoL  scores , Qmax, and PVR at 1 and 3 months  [36].  These 
differences disappear and the treatments become equivalent at [ADDRESS_253889] 1 5 patients with 
symptomatic BPH treated at University of Minnesota. Our initial experience showed a 
technical success and clinical improvement based on IPSS of 90% and  75% respectively . 
Following PAE, 2 out of 15  patients had hematuria ; however,  post-embolization  
cystoscopy showed no bladder ulceration or abnormalities. These patients had a good 
clinical  outcome in the follow up.  Using Cone -Beam CT (CBCT) has allowed to identify 
all the collateral and dangerous anastomosis and prevented from non -target 
embolization.  
 
These initial reports suggest that prostate embolization is safe. The  results suggest that 
improvement in symptoms occurs in the majority of the patients and that shrinkage in 
prostate volume is likely.  Only [ADDRESS_253890] FDA cleara nce for other indications and are 
readily available for interventionalists to use in this treatment. The relevant clinical articles 
are included in Appendix G. The animal studies and the clinical studies related to prostate 
embolization as a treatment for BPH are provided. The studies and case reports related 
to the treatment of bladder or prostate hemorrhage can be provided if needed.

With the proposed procedure there are the general theoretical risks associated with all 
angiograph ic procedures , which  include pain, post procedure groin hematoma, bruising 
or bleeding at the puncture site , pseudoaneurysm, transient or permanent renal injury, 
arterial dissection or thrombosis  (very rarely necessitating amputation) , infection,  fever, 
and a  potential for an allergic reaction to intra -arterial contrast administration.   Some of 
these complications can lead to the need for surgical intervention, new endovascular 
procedure, or even potentially death.   
 
Specific risks to PAE are limited and incl ude migration or non -selective delivery of the 
embolic agent leading to a non -targeted distribution. The most severe result of this could 
include focal necrosis of a segment of the bladder wall.  They may have persistent urinary 
retention or incontinence.   The patient may also have abdominal pain and although never 
reported may theoretically develop sensory abnormalities.  
  
3.5 Rationale  
Current “gold standards” for treatment of BPH include reducing prostate mass through 
either an open or robotic simple prost atectomy or transurethral resection of prostate 
(TURP).  These are not without their own set of complications and risks. Known 
complications include erectile dysfunction, incontinence, bladder neck contractures, 
hematuria, retrograde ejaculation, etc. Esti mates are as high as 1 in 5 (20%) will have a 
surgically related complication.  
 
It is anticipated that PAE, if successful, will offer at least equivalent results with a markedly 
decreased risk profile and fewer complications, enhancing patients’ lives and  health.

such case, the deviation will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible.

5.10 Procedure  
Subjects will be scheduled in Interventional Radiology for a PAE consult a fter they 
complete a urologic evaluation including TRUS, uroflowmetry, cystoscopy , and laboratory 
analyses.  The IR clinic consult will include screening for eligibility, informed consent, 
IPSS, Q oL, and IIEF questionnaire s as well as  a consult appointment with the Principal

the subject study calendar.   
Consented subjects will have prostate embolization.   
 The morning prior to the procedure the pa tient will be given ibuprofen  and Omeprazol.  
The patient will be given ciprofloxacin just prior to the procedure.    
 Under US guidance right common femoral arterial access will be achieved using 
micropuncture technique and micropuncture needle ultimately exchanged for a 5 Fr 
introducer sheath.  
 The left internal iliac artery will be catheterized using an appropriate catheter.   A co -
axial microcatheter system will be advanced into the anterior branch of the internal 
iliac artery and angiograms obtained.  
 The catheter will then be selectively advanced into likely inferior vesical artery and 
microcatheter injections performed to identify and catheterize the prostatic artery.  A 
CBCT may be performed at this stage.   CBCT is optional and will be used in cases 
wher e the provider feels that further spatial resolution is needed to avoid embolizing 
from a point that would cause non -target embolization.  This will be weighed against 
the increased radiation that comes with CBCT.   
 The microcatheter will then be positione d as distally as possible and CBCT study 
obtained to map the prostatic branches.  
 Once catheter position is confirmed embolization will be performed using Embosphere  
or Embozene  particles of a size to be  decided by [CONTACT_212013] . 
 Recheck images will demonstrate good -coverage of the small prostatic branches.  
 At this point the right will be studied after catheterization of the left internal iliac artery 
using an appropriate catheter and angiograms obtained.  
 The microcatheter will be advanced into the prostatic branches and microcatheter 
injections performed.  
 Again a small fraction of microparticles will be injected with adequate coverage of 
vascular branch with preserving the bladder vascularity as much as possib le. 
 The above process will be repeated on the contralateral side resulting in a bilateral 
embolization.  
 Hemostasis at the arterial puncture will be achieved using a closure device followed 
by [CONTACT_212014].

This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  Prostate volume : We want to know if PAE can reduce prostatic volume. An increase in 
prostatic volume can also indicate the progression of BPH. TRUS can be used to measure 
both prostate length and weight . TRUS is the current standard imaging for the clinical 
assessment of the prostate gland [ 35] 
 
Uroflowmetry : Decreased peak urine flow rates are common in men with BPH.  
Uroflowmetry including peak and average flow rates, total void time, and total void volume 
at each follow -up visit.  
 
Post void residual (PVR) urine volume : PVR has generally been considered to reflect the 
severity of bladder outlet obstruction.   PVR will be measured at each follow -up visit to 
monitor impairment or improvement of bladder emptying due to the treatment or disease 
progression.  
 
CTA/MR perfusion : Will identify the prostatic vasculature and serve as a map for the 
embolization procedure.  
  
IPSS and Quality of life : BPH is associated with impairment of quality of life. A validated 
quality of life measure specific to BPH into the study includes  the disease -specific quality 
of life question included with the AUA -SI (or IPSS) questionnaire. [38-39] 
 
Sexual function and dysfunction : Both BPH and many of its therapi[INVESTIGATOR_211999]. The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF -5) Questionnaire is a 
validated, gender -specific measure of sexual function assessed at each follow -up visit  
[40]. 
 
[ADDRESS_253902] safety information reliably, all adverse events will be recorded.  The anticipated 
adverse events include :  
 
 Genitourinary events, i.e., events associated with the urinary tract and/or the 
surrounding genital region  
 Damage to the bladder floor, trigone, sphincters, and rectum  
 Infections  
 Secondary surgical interventions  
 All transient post -procedure events  
 Deaths  
 
Potential Complications of vascular embolization  
Vascular embolization is a high -risk procedure. Complications may occur at any time 
during or after the procedure, and may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 
 Stroke or cerebral infarction  
  Page 17 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized.   Occlusion of vessels in healthy territories  
 Vascular rupture and hemorrhage  
 Neurological deficits  
 Infection or hematoma  at the injection site  
 Allergic reaction, cutaneous irritations  
 Transient pain and fever  
 Vasospasm  
 Death  
 Ischemia at an undesirable location, including ischemic stroke, ischemic infarction 
(including myocardial infarction), and tissue necrosis  
 
Also, the Society of Interventional Radiology complications classes will be assessed 
following the PAE procedure.  These clas ses include vascular, device related, contrast 
related, neurologic, peripheral nervous system complications, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]/pulmonary, 
infectious/inflammatory, and death.   
Adverse events will be categorized according to their respective relatedness to the de vice 
or procedure, and their severity.  The onset, resolution and method of resolution will be 
document ed.   
Adverse Events (AEs) encountered during treatment and post treatment periods will be 
recorded on the appropriate AE pages of the Case Report Form ( CRF).   
For this protocol, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g.,  sign, symptom, 
disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, abnormal laboratory finding) that begins  or 
worsens (in severity or frequency) from baseline status during the treatment or post 
treatment periods. Note:  Unchanged, chronic medical conditions  are NOT AEs and 
should not be recorded on AE pages of the CRF unless there is an exacerbation of a 
chronic condition.  
AEs will be classified according to NCI’s common terminology criteria for adverse events 
V 4.0 (CTCAE) and reported on the schedule below.  
A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronicapplications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf  
AEs should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE):   
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinic al or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting a ge-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) .   
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; dis abling; limiting self care

 Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5 Death related to AE.  
Serious adverse event s (SAEs)  are adverse events occurring at any dose, which meet 
one or more of the following serious criteria : 
 
 AE resulted in death  
 
 Is life-threatening  (i.e. The AE placed the subject at immediate  risk of death; it 
does not apply to an AE which hypothetically might have caused the death if it 
were more severe.)  
 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (i.e. The AE required at least a 24 -
hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_212000].  
 
 Is disabling  (i.e. temporary or permanent disruption in activities of daily living)  
 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus 
of a subject exposed to the study drug prior to co nception or during pregnancy)  
 
 It does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject  
and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  (This criterion should not be used for SAEs that meet any 
other seriousness criteria.)  
 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Events  are those that have not been described in the:  
 
 Package insert or investigator's brochu re (for FDA investigational agents);  
 
 Protocol; or  
 
 Informed consent document.  
 
Adverse Event  - Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment 
or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedur e. 
 
Attribution  – The determination of whether an adverse event is related to a medical 
treatment or procedure. Attribution categories include Definite, Probable, Possible, 
Unlikely and Unrelated.   A clinical events committee will make this determination.  
 
  Page 19 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  Unrelated :   The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational 
agent/procedure. -  i.e.  Another cause of the event is most plausible; 
and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the 
onset of the event and the study  medication administration; and/or a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.   
 
Unlikely :    The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational 
agent/procedure.  
 
Possibly : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence  from 
administration of the study drug/procedure, follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug, but that could readily 
have been produced by a number of other factors.  
 
Probably :   The adverse event is likely related to the investigat ional 
agent/procedure.  
 
Definitely Related :  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational 
agent/procedure – i.e. An event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug, follows a known or 
expected response  pattern to the suspected drug, that is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_212001]’s clinical state.

Introduction
 
 
Cigarette
 
smoking
 
is
 
the
 
leading
 
cause
 
of
 
preventable
 
death
 
and
 
illness
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
and
 
throughout
 
the
 
developed
 
world.
 
Recent
 
work
 
suggests
 
detrimental
 
links
 
between
 
exposure
 
to
 
point-of-sale
 
tobacco
 
marketing
 
(POSTM),
 
increases
 
in
 
cigarette
 
cravings,
 
and
 
the
 
failure
 
to
 
quit
 
smoking.
 
Understanding
 
how
 
individuals
 
are
 
influenced
 
by
 
[CONTACT_510069].
 
We
 
propose
 
to
 
use
 
an
 
innovative
 
set
 
of
 
methods
 
to
 
test
 
whether
 
repeated,
 
real-world
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
affects
 
smoking
 
behavior,
 
and
 
whether
 
this
 
is
 
mediated
 
by
 
[CONTACT_510070].
 
Our
 
approach
 
combines
 
mobile-phone
 
based
 
geolocation
 
tracking,
 
ecological
 
momentary
 
assessment
 
(EMA),
 
and
 
functional
 
magnetic
 
resonance
 
imaging
 
(fMRI).
 
Research
 
using
 
geospatial
 
location
 
tracking
 
and
 
surveys
 
suggests
 
that
 
high
 
levels
 
of
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
may
 
increase
 
craving;
 
however,
 
correlational
 
studies
 
preclude
 
causal
 
inferences
 
about
 
POSTM
 
effects.
 
Relatedly,
 
laboratory
 
studies
 
have
 
documented
 
neural
 
and
 
behavioral
 
reactivity
 
to
 
standardized
 
visual
 
smoking
 
cues,
 
such
 
as
 
photographs
 
of
 
cigarettes
 
in
 
an
 
ashtray,
 
but
 
the
 
brain’s
 
response
 
to
 
naturalistic
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
has
 
not
 
been
 
explored.
 
By
 
[CONTACT_510071],
 
and
 
causal
 
inferences
 
from
 
an
 
experimental
 
pre-post
 
design,
 
we
 
aim
 
to
 
significantly
 
advance
 
actionable
 
insight
 
about
 
POSTM
 
effects
 
in
 
cancer
 
control.
 
 
 
1.1
 
Background
 
and
 
Relevant
 
Literature
 
 
 
Summary:
 
The
 
tobacco
 
industry
 
has
 
come
 
to
 
rely
 
increasingly
 
on
 
point-of-sale
 
tobacco
  
marketing
 
(POST-M),
 
with
  
large
 
displays
 
near
 
cash
 
registers
 
in
 
retail
 
outlets
 
such
 
as
 
convenience
 
stores
 
and
 
gas
 
stations
 
[1].
 
Recent
  
work
 
utilizing
 
geospatial
 
location
 
tracking
 
has
 
found
 
that
 
smoking
 
V2025-[ADDRESS_659410]-M,
 
particularly
 
when
 
their
 
general
  
tobacco
 
craving
 
levels
 
are
 
otherwise
 
low
 
[2].
 
This
 
suggests
 
that
 
POST-M
 
exposure
 
may
 
increase
 
craving,
  
making
 
abstinence
 
more
 
difficult.
 
This
 
finding
 
converges
 
with
 
recent
 
survey
 
results
 
demonstrating
 
that
  
during
 
quit
 
attempts,
 
a
 
significant
 
percentage
 
of
 
smokers
 
experience
 
urges
 
to
 
purchase
 
cigarettes
 
when
  
exposed
 
to
 
POST-M,
 
and
 
feel
 
that
 
the
 
removal
 
of
 
POST-M
 
would
 
make
 
quitting
 
easier
 
[3].
 
These
 
reports
  
indicating
 
that
 
incidental
 
exposure
 
to
 
cigarette
 
cues
 
adversely
 
affects
 
smoking
 
abstinence
 
are
 
supported
  
by
 
[CONTACT_510072].
 
A
 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_510051],
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
hand
 
holding
 
a
 
cigarette,
 
followed
 
by
 
a
 
measurement
 
of
 
participants'
 
craving
  
intensity.
 
Smoking
 
abstinence
 
has
 
been
 
found
 
to
 
potentiate
  
self-reported
 
craving
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
cigarette
 
cues
 
[4-7,8],
  
suggesting
 
a
 
mechanism
 
for
 
the
 
finding
 
that
 
exposure
 
to
 
POST-M
 
during
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt
 
leads
 
to
 
poorer
  
outcomes.
 
No
 
studies,
 
however,
 
have
 
experimentally
 
manipulated
 
exposure
 
to
 
POST-M
 
cues
 
in
 
vivo.
 
To
 
this
 
end,
 
we
 
will
 
examine
 
whether
 
assigning
 
smokers
 
to
 
a
 
high
 
or
 
low
 
level
 
of
 
POST-M
 
exposure
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
their
 
daily
 
routine
 
affects
  
several
 
smoking
 
outcomes.
 
A
 
location
 
tracking
 
smartphone
 
application
 
(Google
 
Maps)
 
will
 
be
 
used
 
to
  
document
 
participants’
 
exposure
 
to
 
retail
 
outlets
 
and
 
link
 
each
 
person
 
to
 
the
 
retail
 
environment.
  
Measurements
 
will
 
assess
 
longitudinal
 
tobacco-use
 
patterns
 
and
 
perceptions
 
across
 
the
 
study
 
period,
 
as
  
well
 
as
 
changes
 
in
 
cravings.
 
If
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
case
 
that
 
low
 
POST-M
 
exposure
 
reduces
 
smoking,
 
this
 
emphasizes
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
further
 
regulation
 
of
 
retail
 
advertising
 
for
  
tobacco.
 
 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
the
 
hypotheses
 
and
 
analysis
 
plans
 
described
 
here,
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
has
 
preregistered

consistently
 
reports
 
associations
 
between
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
in
 
naturalistic
 
settings,
 
and
 
increased
 
smoking

and

The
 
density
 
of
 
POSTM
 
in
 
an
 
individual’s
 
neighborhood,
 
a
 
proxy
 
for
 
exposure,
 
also
 
influences
 
smoking
 
behavior
29–33
;
 
for
 
example,
 
longitudinal
 
work
 
finds
 
that
 
smokers
 
are
 
more
 
likely
 
to
 
relapse
 
during
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt
 
if
 
they
 
live
 
near
 
a
 
POSTM
 
store
34
.
 
In
 
a
 
virtual
 
store
 
study,
 
enclosing
 
the
 
POSTM
 
display
 
reduced
 
smokers’
 
purchase
 
attempts
 
and
 
urges
 
to
 
smoke
35
.
 
This
 
body
 
of
 
research
 
thus
 
suggests
 
that
 
further
 
regulation
 
of
 
POSTM
 
would
 
be
 
beneficial
 
from
 
a
 
cancer
 
control
 
perspective;
 
however,
 
causal
 
evidence
 
linking
 
longitudinal,
 
naturalistic
 
exposure
 
and
 
smoking
 
outcomes,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
neural
 
evidence
 
supporting
 
the
 
mechanisms
 
of
 
cumulative
 
and
 
causal
 
effects,
 
would
 
substantially
 
bolster
 
science-based
 
policy
 
making.
 
 
The
 
significance
 
of
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
and
 
ecological
 
momentary
 
assessment.
 
Geolocation
 
tracking
 
provides
 
the
 
unique
 
ability
 
to
 
objectively
 
and
 
unobtrusively
 
assess
 
participants’
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
outlets.
 
The
 
recent
 
ubiquity
 
of
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
built-in
 
to
 
smartphones
 
provides
 
the
 
opportunity
 
for
 
incorporating
 
this
 
methodology
 
into
 
experimental
 
designs
 
with
 
reduced
 
participant
 
burden.
 
This
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
improvement
 
over
 
prior
 
POSTM
 
exposure
 
work,
 
which
 
is
 
limited
 
by
 
[CONTACT_510073]-reports
 
of
 
the
 
timing
 
and
 
degree
 
of
 
POSTM
 
exposure,
 
or
 
by
 
[CONTACT_510074],
 
non-representative
 
exposures.
 
In
 
PA,
 
DE,
 
and
 
NJ,
 
where
 
data
 
collection
 
will
 
take
 
place,
 
obtaining
 
a
 
local
 
cigarette
 
dealer
 
license
 
is
 
mandatory
 
for
 
cigarette
 
retailers
36
 
and
 
listings
 
of
 
licensed
 
outlets
 
are
 
publicly
 
available
 
and
 
updated
 
monthly
37
.
 
Layering
 
smokers’
 
geolocation
 
tracks
 
onto
 
maps
 
of
 
tobacco
 
retail
 
outlets
 
allows
 
objective
 
quantification
 
of
 
an
 
individual’s
 
exposure
 
to
 
POSTM
 
in
 
their
 
natural
 
environment.
 
38
.
 
In
 
parallel
 
with
 
geolocation
 
tracking,
 
we
 
will
 
sample
 
participants’
 
behaviors
 
and
 
craving
 
throughout
 
each
 
day
 
using
 
EMA,
 
to
 
capture
 
time-sensitive
 
fluctuations
 
in
 
a
 
representative
 
manner
15
.
 
EMA
 
optimally
 
complements
 
the
 
naturalistic
 
geolocation
 
tracking
 
data
 
by
 
[CONTACT_510075]’
 
location

with
 
reports
 
indicating
 
natural
 
smoking
 
behavior
 
and
 
craving
 
on
 
a
 
moment-to-moment
 
basis.
 
Thus,
 
this
 
project
 
will
 
link
 
individuals’
 
smoking
 
cravings
 
and
 
behavior
 
to
 
the
 
POSTM
 
environment
 
in
 
both
 
time
 
and
 
location.

The

If
 
the

in

condition
 
is
 
significantly
 
(

greater
 
than
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
“increased

in
 
the
 
control
 
condition,
 
this
 
will
 
trigger
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
to
 
reconvene
 
for
 
a
 
reassessment
 
with
 
members
 
of
 
the

the
 
Primary
 
Investigator,
 
the
 
Co-Investigators
 
who
 
have
 
expertise
 
in
 
tobacco
 
research,
 
and
 
the
 
external
 
stakeholders.
 
This
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
termination
 
of
 
this
 
arm
 
of
 
the

and
 
reassignment
 
of

participants
 
to
 
the
 
other
 
two
 
groups.
 
Additionally,
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
this

we
 
will
 
reach
 
out
 
to
 
the
 
participants
 
in
 
all
 
conditions
 
who
 
met
 
the
 
criteria
 
for
 
an
 
“increased

to
 
offer
 
additional
 
counseling
 
on
 
smoking
 
cessation
 
resources.
  
The

will
 
further
 
make

The

to
 
withdrawal
 
of
 
the

procedures
 
should
 
be
 
clinically

Although
 
an

it

Risks
 
 
●
 
There
 
may
 
be
 
a
 
risk
 
of
 
unintentional
 
breach
 
of
 
conﬁdentiality,
 
but
 
we
 
will
 
take
 
all
 
necessary
 
steps
 
to
 
prevent
 
this
 
from
 
happening.
 
Internet
 
data
 
transfers
 
between
 
mobile
 
device
 
users
 
and
 
the
 
study
 
web-server
 
will
 
be
 
based
 
on
 
a
 
session
 
ID
 
unique
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
and
 
the
 
date
 
and
 
time
 
of
 
access.
 
All
 
information
 
collected
 
via
 
the
 
Internet
 
will
 
be
 
kept
 
secure
 
in
 
transit
 
using
 
the
 
Secure
 
Socket
 
Layer
 
(SSL)
 
protocol,
 
the
 
same
 
technology
 
used
 
to
 
encrypt
 
credit
 
card
 
numbers
 
during
 
transmission
 
over
 
the
 
Internet.
 
All
 
data
 
will
 
be
 
stored
 
in
 
a
 
database
 
subject
 
to
 
both
 
physical
 
and
 
electronic
 
protection.
 
 
●
 
Past
 
literature
 
suggests
 
that
 
there
 
may
 
be
 
negative
 
consequences
 
of
 
increased
 
exposure
 
to
 
POST-marketing,
 
such
 
as
 
increased
 
difﬁculty
 
in
 
quitting
 
and
 
increased
 
craving
 
during
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt.
 
However,
 
our
 
manipulation
 
does
 
not
 
involve
 
a
 
quit
 
attempt,
 
and
 
does
 
not
 
go
 
beyond
 
a
 
level
 
of
 
POST-marketing
 
exposure
 
that
 
participants
 
may
 
be
 
expected
 
to
 
have
 
in
 
their
 
normal
 
daily
 
lives.
 
At
 
most,
 
participants
 
are
 
asked
 
to
 
enter
 
a
 
POST-marketing
 
store,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
common
 
convenience
 
store,
 
once
 
per
 
day.
 
Thus,
 
the
 
study
 
design
 
poses
 
risk
 
to
 
participants
 
on
 
par
 
with
 
everyday
 
life.
  
 
●
 
For
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
COVID-19
 
pandemic,
 
entry
 
into
 
retail
 
stores
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
study
 
V2025-06
 

 
may
 
increase
 
participants'
 
risk
 
of
 
being
 
exposed
 
to
 
and
 
spreading
 
SARS-COV-2,
 
the
 
virus
 
that
 
causes
 
COVID-19
 
disease.
 
To
 
reduce
 
transmission
 
risks,
 
the
 
study
 
team
 
will
 
send
 
participants
 
KN95/KF94
 
or
 
N95
 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13530]
 
(masks)
 
in
 
their
 
box
 
of
 
study
 
materials,
 
which
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
strongly
 
encouraged
 
to
 
wear
 
during
 
study-related
 
store
 
visits
 
(in
 
accordance
 
with
 
local
 
guidelines)
 
and
 
in
 
their
 
daily
 
life.
 
Participants
 
are
 
also
 
required
 
to
 
be
 
vaccinated
 
against
 
COVID-19.

For

component:
 
Safety
 
concerns
 
in
 
MR
 
environment:
 
The
 
magnetic
 
field
 
of
 
the
 
MRI
 
environment
 
has
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
cause
 
burns
 
or
 
bodily
 
injury
 
if
 
ferrous
 
metal
 
objects
 
are
 
implanted
 
in
 
the
 
body
 
or
 
if
 
personal
 
articles
 
containing
 
ferrous
 
material
 
are
 
brought
 
into
 
the
 
MR
 
environment.
 
Because
 
we
 
are
 
excluding
 
subjects
 
with
 
contraindications
 
for
 
MR
 
studies
 
(e.g.,
 
metallic
 
implants
 
such
 
as
 
pacemakers,
 
surgical
 
aneurysm
 
clips,
 
or
 
known
 
metal
 
fragments
 
embedded
 
in
 
the
 
body)
 
using
 
a
 
standard
 
screening
 
form,
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
damage
 
due
 
to
 
implanted
 
metal
 
is
 
low.
 
Investigators
 
and
 
personnel
 
of
 
the
 
MRI
 
unit
 
have
 
extensive
 
experience
 
with
 
standard
 
safety
 
precautions,
 
including
 
safety
 
screening
 
on
 
paper
 
and
 
verbally
 
by
 
a
 
trained
 
technologist.
 
These
 
considerations
 
minimize
 
the
 
risk
 
of
 
accident
 
or
 
injury
 
in
 
the
 
MR
 
environment.
 
Psychological
 
discomfort
 
secondary
 
to
 
MRI
 
acquisition
 
may
 
occur
 
in
 
some
 
subjects
 
due
 
to
 
claustrophobia.
 
Claustrophobia
 
is
 
also
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
exclusion
 
criteria,
 
and
 
participants
 
are
 
informed
 
that
 
they
 
may
 
stop
 
the
 
study
 
at
 
any
 
time
 
without
 
consequences
 
to
 
them.
 
Risk
 
of
 
discomfort
 
due
 
to
 
fMRI
 
scanner
 
noise
 
will
 
be
 
minimized
 
by
 
[CONTACT_510112].
 
The
 
level
 
of
 
noise
 
is
 
not
 
great
 
enough
 
to
 
pose
 
a
 
health
 
risk,
 
with
 
or
 
without
 
earphones.
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
risk
 
that
 
the
 
magnetic
 
resonance
 
image
 
will
 
reveal
 
a
 
minor
 
or
 
significant
 
lesion
 
in
 
the
 
brain,
 
e.g.
 
a
 
tumor,
 
previously
 
unknown
 
to
 
the
 
subject.
 
Structural
 
MRI
 
scans
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
read
 
by
 
a
 
radiologist,
 
and
 
subjects
 
will
 
be
 
informed
 
of
 
this.
 
No
 
diagnostic
 
or
 
clinical
 
information
 
will
 
be
 
provided,
 
and
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
informed
 
of
 
this
 
before
 
consenting
 
to
 
participate.
 
We
 
exclude
 
subjects
 
with
 
contraindications
 
for

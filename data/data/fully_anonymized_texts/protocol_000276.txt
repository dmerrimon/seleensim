Date: April 5, [ADDRESS_1015564] and registered with the National Library of Medicine ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Research team 
members screened patients using the electronic medical record syst em. We obtained written informed 
consent from all participants. Patients were enrolled between December 2017 and July 2019.  
        All adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) presenting with a suspected exacerbation of CHS and had active 
vomiting or nausea in the  ED were eligible. Exclusion criteria were: minors (< 18 years old), pregnancy, 
known allergy to capsaicin or hot peppers, those with resolution of nausea prior to randomization, 
outpatient use of prescription antiemetics within the past [ADDRESS_1015565] performed 
prior to enrollment. We randomized patients that provided informed consent to the experimental or 
control group using REDCap database (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt Univers ity). 
Randomization used 1:1 allocation and stratified by [CONTACT_547]. The treatment consisted of five grams of 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 0.1% capsaicin cream, and the placebo consisted of a moisturizing cream. The study team pre -
packaged the capsaicin and placebo creams in iden tical single -dispensing tubes and coded each with a 
study identification number. The capsaicin cream and the placebo were identical in appearance and had 
no scent. An ED nurse applied study medication cream once to the abdomen in a uniform manner. The 
treating physicians, research team members, and patients were blinded to study drug allocation. In 
addition to study medication, patients received conventional therapy, which was determined by [CONTACT_742860].  
 
Methods a nd Measurements  
         Research team members collected relevant patient demographic, clinical, and treatment data and 
entered data into a secure REDCap. We measured the intensity of the patient’s nausea upon 
randomization and at 30 - and 60 -minutes follow ing application of study medication. For nausea 
assessment, we used a previously validated visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10 cm ([ADDRESS_1015566] severe).18,19 A research team member remained at the patient’s bedside for the first 60 
minutes to assess for any immediate adverse events. Additionally, the patient was assessed for any 
adverse events over the entire course of the patient’s ED stay and, later, through a phone call at 30 
days.  
 
Outcomes  
        The primary outcome was the patient’s reported nausea on the VAS at 30 minutes following study 
medication application. Secondary outcomes were the patient’s reported nausea and percent change 
from baseline at 60 minutes, disposition status (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l admission or discharge), and the need for 
rescue anti -emetic medication. The [ADDRESS_1015567] (<30 minutes) but may have a delayed maximum 
effect. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_742859].

  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) are significant health burdens and are on the rise across  the globe. Nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease is characterized by [CONTACT_720300], insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus,  dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, and other aspects of metabolic 
syndrome. N onalcoholic steatohepatitis shares these characteristics but additionally is 
characterized by [CONTACT_720301] , hepatocyte necrosis  and potentially  fibrosis, which places 
patients at increased  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_720277].   
The prevalence of NAFLD, NASH and HCC are on the rise throughout the world. In a recent 
study published by [CONTACT_720302]. ( Estes, 2018), NAFLD cases in the [LOCATION_003] are projected to increase 
from 83.1 million in 2015 to 100.9 million in 2030. This equates to a 33.5% prevalence among 
adults over the age of 15. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cases in the U SA are projected to rise 
from 16.5 million in 2015 to 27 million in 2030.  In addition, the incidence of HCC is projected to increase by 137% from 2015 to 2030 leading to an incr ease in liver related deaths.  From 2015 
to 2030, the estimate of nearly 800,000 excess liver deaths are expected.  From a global 
perspective, NAFLD prevalence is 25.4% with the highest rates in the Middle East and South America.  This correlates with a 40.76% rate of NASH and/or fibrosis  progression.  The HCC 
incidence was 0.44 per 1,000 person years in NAFLD patients.  Liver associated mortality had a 
higher risk ratio 1.94 compared to overall mortality 1.05 in a NAFLD patient population 
(Siddiqui, 2018).   When looking at the  [LOCATION_003], it is reported the NAFLD rates to be between 10 
and 30%.  These rates also apply to Europe and Asia ( Younossi, 2016).  
There are currently no [LOCATION_003] Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approved medications 
specifically for NAFLD or N ASH, but many drug candidates are in development.  
Many pathological processes contribute to NASH, including the toxic effects of fat 
accumulation, oxidative stress, cell injury and cell death, leukocyte recruitment and activation of 
infiltrating cells and resident macrophages, profibrogenic activation of hepatic stellate cells, 
fibrosis, and carcinogenic transformation of liver cells.  Effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_720278].  Targeting late -disease processes, especially 
those related to fibrosis, is especially important.  Most patients with NAFLD and early NASH 
are asymptomatic and therefore it is expected that they will already have moderately advanced NASH by [CONTACT_720303].  Also, fibrosis is the strongest predictor of adverse 
clinical outcomes associated with NASH  such as progression to cirrhosis and HCC .  Whereas 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_720279], inflammation, and other triggers of NASH will be important for halting disease progression,  it is vitally important to develop treatments that more directly inhibit 
fibrogenesis, stimulate fibrolysis, promote restoration of liver function, reduce the risks of 
carcinogenesis, and restrict tumor progression.  CRV431 is a drug candidate that is proposed to 
directly target many of these pathological events.  
5.2. Rationale  
CRV431 is a chemically modified analog of the immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporine A (CsA). 
Cyclosporine A exerts its immunosuppression by a two- step process. C yclosporine A first binds 
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -201  Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_720274], Inc.  
Version 5.0 
01 March 2021 Confidential   Page 20 of 64 
  to cyclophilin A  (Cyp A), a peptidylprolyl isomerase that regulates target protein structure and 
function by [CONTACT_720304] -trans conformation of proline peptide bonds.   Then the CsA -Cyp 
A duplex binds to and inhibits the activity of the phosphatase, calcineurin, in lymphocytes.   
CRV431 is chemically and functionally different from CsA in that it retains binding to Cyp A , 
but the CRV431- cyclophilin duplex does not strongly bind to calcineurin and therefore does not 
have significant immunosuppressive potential.  
CRV431 binding and inhibition of Cyp A is 13 -times more potent than that of CsA with an 
inhibitor constant, Ki = 1 nM, and it is this high- affinity, cyclophilin inhibition that is proposed 
to mediate therapeutic effects of CRV431. Moreover, CRV431 inhibits not only Cyp A but also 
other cyclophilin isoforms, notably cyclophilin B  (Cyp B)  and cyclophilin D (Cyp D), which 
contribute to a variety of pathological processes ( Nigro  et al., 2013; Naoumov, 2014; Bukrinsky, 
2015; Dawar et al., 2017a, b; Briston et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2018). For example, Cyp A is an abundant cytosolic cyclophilin that influences many intracellular signaling 
pathways.  It is released from injured cells and stimulates inflammation by [CONTACT_106820]147 and 
contributes to cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia and is recruited into the life cycles of many 
viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Cyclophilin B is located 
in the endoplasmic reticulum where it participates in protein fo lding and secretion of proteins. 
Notably, Cyp B regulates  procollagen hydroxylation, formation of procollagen triple -helices , and 
rates of secretion of procollagen from cells .  Impairment  of Cyp B -regulated  procollagen 
production is hypothesized to be the major mechanism by [CONTACT_720305]431 decreases liver 
fibrosis.   Cyp D is located in the mitochondrial matrix and is the primary regulator of 
mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTP).  These mitochondrial pores open in 
response to common types of cellular injury, such as oxidative stress and calcium overload, 
leading to mitochondrial destruction and cell necrosis.  Inhibition of Cyp D protects cells from a 
variety of insults and may be important for reducing cell loss and ensuing pathological cas cades 
in NASH livers. Cyclophilin D also is implicated in liver steatosis and in oncogenic events 
related to the tumor suppressor, p53, to which Cyp D binds. In summary, several cyclophilin-
dependent pathological processes in NASH livers are likely to be attenuated by [CONTACT_720306]431.   For 
information on mechanism of action and additional preclinical data, please refer to the CRV431 
Investigational Brochure.   
5.3. Rationale for this Stu dy Design and Dose Selection  
CRV431 has consistently demonstrated the ability to prevent the progression of liver fibrosis in a 
variety of animal models and in precision- cut human liver slices.  The primary mechanism of 
action to prevent collagen synthesis is via Cyp B inhibition although a dditional mechanisms may 
involve Cyp A and Cyp D.  The half maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC50 ) for cyclophilin 
inhibition range s from 3.2 to 9.5 ng/mL.  Human whole blood concentrations after a single dose 
75 mg of CRV431 achieved a maximum observed whole blood concentration (Cmax) of 334 ± 
106 ng/mL.  Steady state concentrations for 75 mg QD dosed for 28 days achieved a C max of

  7.4. Study Restriction  
7.4.1.  Prohibited and Concomitant Medication  
Any prescription medication or over the counter medication taken from 30 days prior to the time 
of consent to the End of Study/Early Termination Visi t will be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record (source document) and Case Report F orm ( CRF ).  
Once a subject is considered eligible, prior to Day 1, a concomitant medication form will be 
completed by [CONTACT_720308].  
Use of the following medication  prior to and during the study is prohibited: 
• Any drugs or substances known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_983338] dose of study drug. ( NOTE: 
Please refer to Appendix A  and if there are questions, please contact [CONTACT_456]);  
• Systemic immunosuppressants, with the exception of short -term treatment for asthma, 
received within [ADDRESS_983339] dose of study drug and during the study;  
• Any investigational product or investigational device received within [ADDRESS_983340] should be treated according to the judgement of the PI.  
 
Consumption of foods and beverages containing the following substances will be prohibited as 
indicated:  
• Xanthines/caffein e:  24 hours prior to dosing and throughout the period of PK sample 
collection; 
• Alcohol:  48 hours prior to dosing and throughout the period of PK sample collection;  
• Grapefruit/Seville orange:  [ADDRESS_983341] 
should try to receive their second dose of the vaccine seven days prior to the commencement of 
receiving study drug ( Day 1) or receive their first dose of the vaccine [ADDRESS_983342]’s Concomitant Medications CRF page 
if the subject  receives the vaccine after consent and through Day 42/EOS.   
7.6. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSM B) will monitor  the trial .  The DSM B will 
comprise of medical professionals with expertise in NASH  and clinical trials and are external to 
the Sponsor.  The DSMB will meet periodically or as needed to review accumulating safety  data 
and any available PK data collected  throughout the trial.  
Safety and available PK data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_720309]. The DSMB  will review safet y data when at least six (6) subjects in Cohort A 
(CRV431 75 mg) and at least three (3) subjects in Cohort B (matching placebo) have reached [ADDRESS_983343]  includes: 
• Grade 3 or higher CTCAE AEs possibly or probably related to study drug  as 
determined by [CONTACT_86206]; 
• Grade 4  CTCAE  AEs regardless of relation to study drug as determined by [CONTACT_290164]; 
• Any SAE s thought to be related to the study drug as determined by [CONTACT_720310].  
For s ubjects experiencing any hepatic AE s or SAE s judged by [CONTACT_720311], the investigator , DSMB, Medical Monitor  and S ponsor will review all 
available safety data and make a determination to proceed with one of the following options : 
• If the event was a drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ), considered  as increases in  
aminotransferases (AT) >[ADDRESS_983344] or >3 x baseline where baseline is defined as the 
average values of Screening and Day -1, no additional subjects will be dosed until it 
is determined  that it is safe to proceed and in addition the frequency of blood 
chemistries will increase to daily, if appropriate.

  − Repeat testing of ALT, AST, ALP, TB L will be performed within 48- 72 hours to 
confirm the abnormality.  
− If there are persistent elevations  of AT  > [ADDRESS_983345] or a 2 -fold increase above 
baseline values (for those subjects with elevated values prior to drug exposure) 
upon repeat testing then close observation visits should be implemented and/or discontinuation of drug should be considered.  Close  Observations are described in 
Section  7.8. 
• If the event was not a DILI, as defined above, one of the following actions will be 
taken:  
− Dose an entire additional cohort at the same or lower dose than the dose taken by 
[CONTACT_720312];  
− Continue to pause the study, until it is determined, that it is safe to proceed.  
A decision to discontinue or temporarily interrupt the study drug for a subject will be  considered 
based on following criteria:  
• If ALT/AST baseline measurements (BLM) are <[ADDRESS_983346] increases to >5  x BLM ; 
• If ALT/AST BLM ≥[ADDRESS_983347] but <[ADDRESS_983348] increases to 
3 x BLM ; 
• If ALT/AST BLM ≥[ADDRESS_983349] increases to >2 x BLM 
AND the increase is accompanied by a concomitant increase in TBL  to >2  x BLM 
OR the International Normalized Ratio ( INR) concomitantly increases by >0.2; 
• Any subjects with signs and symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, and/or rash, accompanied by a >5% increase in  
eosinophils; 
• Subjects who miss more than 2 consecutive QD doses of study drug. Subjects may be replaced unless a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_720280].

women who have not undergone surgical sterilization; specifically, hystere ctomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, hysteroscopic sterilization, and/or tubal ligation, must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening , within  the [ADDRESS_983380] associated with 
the use of a drug (investigational or non- investigational) in humans, whether or not considered 
drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -201  Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_720274], Inc.  
Version 5.0 
01 March 2021 Confidential   Page 49 of 64 
  finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgement on causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in 
combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, 
including overdose.  
All AEs that occur after any subject has been consented, before treatment, during treatment, or 
up to and including the End of Study or Early Termination Visit, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_720318][INVESTIGATOR_2394].  
11.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event s  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it fulfills at least one of the following:  
• Results in death;  
• It is immediately life -threatening; 
• It requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect;  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been consented, before treatment, during treatment, or up to and including the End of Study or Early Termination Visit, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_720318][INVESTIGATOR_2394].  
11.2.3.  Other Adverse Event s  
Other AEs will be identified by [CONTACT_720319].  Adverse events of special 
interest , other than SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of the subject from the study, will be 
classified as other AEs.  For each of these other AEs , a narrative may be written and included in 
the Clinical Study Report.  
11.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product, when appropriate, for each AE (unrelated, possibly related or probably 
related).  The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause  and effect 
relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE 
should be considered “related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -[ADDRESS_983381] and/or in response to an open question from 
the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and pulse 
requiring an intervention should be reported as AEs. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the 
onset (date and time), resolution (date and time) , severity, causality, action taken, serious outcome 
(if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study.   
Adverse events  should be collected and recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF 
beginning at the time of signing the informed consent. Adverse events 
and SAEs should be reported 
through End of Study V isit or Early Termination V isit.  Both AEs and SAEs should be followed until 
resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually agreed upon between the medical  monitor 
and i nvestigator.   
Subject s who experience any AE or SAE should receive appropriate treatment and medical 
supervision as clinically indicated.  
All AEs will be graded for severity according to the Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse 
Events t able v5.0 ( CTCAE , 2017 ). 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  11.2.[ADDRESS_983382] be reported and recorded on Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]’s pregnancy form.  Pregnancy, in itself, is  not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_174509] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject  was 
discontinued from the study.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abo rtions without complications should not be 
handled as AEs.  
11.5. Reporting Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_983383] provide a follow -up report as soon as the event resolves (or upon receipt of significant 
information if the event is still ongoing).  Additional follo w-up information, if required or 
available, should reported to the Sponsor within one business Day of receipt. This should be completed on a follow -up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with 
the appropriate section of the CRF an d/or study file.  
All SAEs must be followed until resolution/stabilization or until a time that is mutually  agreed 
upon between the Medical Monitor and the Investigator.

Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) summarized by [CONTACT_720321] (TEAE) and the number of TEAEs reported. A by -subject 
AE data listing including verbatim term, coded term, treatment, severity, and relationship to 
population will be provided.   
Safety data including ECGs, vital signs assessments and clinical laboratory results, will be summarized by [CONTACT_720322].  
Descriptive statistics using appropriate summary statistics will be calculated for quantitative safety data as well as for the difference to baseline, when appropriate. In addition, a shift table 
describing out of normal range shifts will be provided for clinical laboratory results.   
Concomitant medications will be listed by [CONTACT_720323]. Medical history will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
Protocol HEPA -CRV431 -[ADDRESS_983384] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
13.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigator can enter a subject  into the study, Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or representative) may visit the 
investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities;  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or representative).  This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or 
representative) and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or representative) will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s);  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable;  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRF, and that investigational product accountability 
checks are being performed;  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the CRF 
with the subject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each 
subject  (e.g., clinic charts);  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or representative);  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or representative) and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
13.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_720286] (or representative ), regulatory authority personal , or members of 
IEC or IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections including source data verification.  
The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data 
were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice, guidel ines of the International Conference on Harmonization , and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  The investigator should contact [CONTACT_720318][INVESTIGATOR_720287] a

written approval to Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (or representative) before he or she can enroll any subject into the study. 
The investigator is responsible for informing the  IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol 
in accordance with local requirements.  In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all advertising 
used to recruit subjects  for the study.  The protocol must be re -approved by [CONTACT_720325], as local regulations require.  
The investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious 
adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the investigational product.  Hepi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 
(or represent ative) will provide this information to the investigator. 
Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB or IEC according to local regulations and guidelines.  
15.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with International Conference on Harmonization 
/Good Clinical Practice , and applicable regulatory requirements.  
15.3. Written Informed Consent 
The investigator(s) at each center will ensure that the subject  is given full and adequate oral and 
written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study.  Subjects  
must also be notified that they are free to discontinue f rom the study at any time.  The subject  
should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
The subject ’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study 
procedures. The investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed ICF.  A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the subject .

 Treatment  Period  
Subjects will receive treatment with CRV431 or placebo from Day 1 to Day 28.  
 Follow Up Period  
After completion of the treatment period, the subjects will be monitored for additional 14 days.  
3.2 Treatment  
Subjects in Cohort A will receive CRV431 75 mg (1 x 75 mg softgel capsule) QD and subjects in 
Cohort B will receive  the matching placebo (1 x placebo softgel capsule) for Cohort A. 
Subjects in Cohort C will receive CRV431 225 mg (3 x 75 mg softgel capsules) QD and subjects in Cohort D will receive the matchin g placebo (3 x placebo softgel capsules) for Cohort C. 
 Treatment Administration  
Subjects will take study drug on the morning of each dosing day, with approximately [ADDRESS_983393] report

CONFIDENTIAL    Page [ADDRESS_983394], when appropriate, for each AE (unrelated, possibly related or probably 
related). The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause and effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.”  If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” or “probable” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.
 
 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it fulfills at least one of the following: 
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may requir e medical  
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 Adverse Event Summaries  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) occurring after completion of the informed consent process and before the end of study, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be included and classified by [CONTACT_720326] (MedDRA).     
For treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), the following will be summarized and presented for the 
safety  analysis set:  
i. An overall summary of TEAEs, which includes:   
a. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE  
b. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE by [CONTACT_720327] 
c. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE by [CONTACT_720328] 
d. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a TEAE leading to study 
withdrawal  
e. the number and percentage of subject s experiencing a treatment emergent SAE 
(TESAE)  
ii. the number and percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE by [CONTACT_720329][INVESTIGATOR_720274], Inc.HEPA- CRV431 -201 Statistical Analysis Plan (version 1.0)  
 
CONFIDENTIAL    Page [ADDRESS_983395] s experiencing a TEAE leading to study 
withdrawal by [CONTACT_720330] (i), besides tabulating the number and percentage of 
subject s, the total number of TEAE epi[INVESTIGATOR_720290]. If a subject  has repeated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] a particular TEAE, all epi[INVESTIGATOR_720291].   
In the remaining summary tables, the incidence of TEAEs will be calculated by [CONTACT_720331] s who  have experienced the event by [CONTACT_720332] s in the safety  
set.  Thus, the incidence of TEAEs is shown in terms of the total number of subject s and not in 
terms of the total number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  If a subject  has repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] a particular TEAE, 
only the most severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], or the epi[INVESTIGATOR_720292], 
will be counted in the summary tables.  
A subject  with more than one type of TEAE in a particular SOC will be counted only once in the 
total of subjects experiencing TEAEs in that particular SOC.  Since a subject could have more 
than one type of TEAE within a particular SOC, the sum of subject s experiencing different 
TEAEs within the SOC could appear larger than the total number of subjects experiencing 
TEAEs in that SOC.  Similarly, a subject  who has experienced a TEAE in more than one SOC 
will be counted only once in the total number of subject s experiencing AEs in all SOCs. 
All occurrences of all AEs will be listed for each subject , grouped by [CONTACT_9084].  The listing will 
contain the following information: treatment group, verbatim term, SOC, PT, severity, relationship to study medication, date and day of onset, date and day of resolution, treatment given to treat the adverse event, the outcome, whether the event was an SAE, whether it led to withdrawal and whether it is a TEAE .  Listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_720333], 
onset date, SOC, and PT. If the onset date is completely missing, then these events will be presented first . If the onset date is missing a month or a day, then these events will be presented 
before any complete dates.  
7.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
Hematology, Coagulation, Blood Chemistry and Urinalysis  data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_6982].  All clinical laboratory data  will be converted to International System 
of Units ( SI). Both raw and change from baseline values will be summarized by [CONTACT_720334]. 
Central and local drug and alcohol test results and pregnancy tests results will be listed.  
7.4 Vital Signs  
Vital sign s raw and change from baseline values will be summarized by [CONTACT_720335], heart rate, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_720293].

TITLE: Part A:  A Phase 2A, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Single Dose, Sequential 
Group Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics, and Pharmacokinetics of 
PB2452 with Ticagrelor Pretreatment in Older and Elderly Subjects  
STUDY PHASE: 2A 
STUDY SITE: 1 clinical site in the [LOCATION_002]: [COMPANY_003] Pha se [ADDRESS_682501], Austin, [LOCATION_007] [ZIP_CODE] 
INDICATION:  Reversal of  ticagrelor  anti-platelet activity  
DURATION OF STUDY:  The estimated duration of the study for each subject, excluding 
Screening, is approximately 35  days.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary : 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) doses of PB2452 vs matching placebo 
with oral ticagrelor plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) pretreatment in older and elderly subjects  
• To assess the efficacy /pharmacodynamics (PD ) of intravenous ( IV) doses of PB2452 vs matching 
placebo in reversing ticagrelor antiplatelet activity by [CONTACT_35755] P2Y 12 reaction units (PRU) with 
VerifyNow® P2Y 12 assay in older and elderly subjects    
Secondary :

• To determine the PK of ticagrelor and the ticagrelor active metabolite AR -C124910XX (TAM) in 
the presence of PB2452  
• To evaluate the effect of PB2452 on ticagrelor antiplatelet activity by [CONTACT_526050] (LTA) and platelet reactivity index (PRI)  
with vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay by [CONTACT_28745]- linked  immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA)  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity potential of PB2452 
Exploratory : 
• To evaluate the effect of PB2452 on the PK profile of unbound ticagrelor and unbound TAM 
plasma concentrations 
• To investigate the effect of PB2452 vs matching placebo on circulating biomarkers of platelet 
activation, such as P -selectin, in subjects pretreated with ticagrelor + ASA  
• To examine the correlation between estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) and the  PK of 
ticagrelor and TAM.  
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
This is Part A of a two-part Phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, 
sequential group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK , and PD of PB2452 vs matching 
placebo. Part A investigates various dose levels an d regimens of PB2452 administered intravenously 
to older (age s 50 to 64 years) and elderly (ages 65 to 80 years) male and female subjects pretreated 
with ticagrelor + aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA) as part of dual antiplatelet therapy . Part B investigates various dose 
levels and regimens of PB2452 administered to healthy male and female subjects (ages 18 -50) 
pretreated with a high dose of ticagrelor alone (180 mg twice daily ( BID)). Part B is  described in a 
separate protocol document.

Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part A  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 5 In Part A described herein, up to 5 dos e levels and/or administration regimens will be evaluated in up 
to 5 cohorts. Each cohort will include 8 to 12 subjects randomized in a 3:1 ratio (PB2452:placebo). 
All references to study drug within the content of the protocol apply to PB2452 or matching placebo.   
This initial cohort (Cohort 1) will include approximately 8 subjects ages 50 to 80 years pretreated 
with ASA + ticagrelor who will be  randomized to 18 grams (g) of PB2452 or matching placebo 
administered as an initial 6 g bolus infused over 10 minutes, followed by 12 g infused over the next 15 hours and 50 minutes to complete a 16 hour regimen. This initial regimen was shown to be safe 
and well tolerated in healthy young adults (18 to 50 years) in a prior Phase 1 study and provided immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor.  
Following completion of Cohort 1, subsequent cohort(s) may  test the same, higher or lower dose 
levels, and/or different  infusion regimens of PB2452 or matching placebo in the same population as 
in Cohort 1, or in different populations such as  elderly subjects (65 to 80 years old)  as determined by 
[CONTACT_526051](s) . A writte n 
Dosing Memo provided by [CONTACT_526052], 
cohort population, cohort size, sampling schedules and other cohort- specific study activities prior to 
initiation of each cohort. The maximum total dose of PB2452 administered to any subject will not exceed 30g. Duration of study drug infusions will not exceed 48 hours. The maximum administration 
rate of PB2452 will not exceed 18g over 30 minutes.   
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all available safety data from ongoing or completed 
cohorts and will document their review and assessment in written SRC minutes prior to initiation of a 
subsequent cohort. Dose escalation may occur only if the SRC affirms the dose and regimen from the 
previously completed cohorts were safe and well tolerated and no  dose -limiting toxicities  (DLTs ) 
were observed.  
The study will consist of a Screening period (Days –45 to –4), a Check -in day (Day -3) and  
Pretreatment Period , an on- site Randomization/Treatment day (Day 1), 3 days on- site for treatment 
and safety monitoring, a Follow -up Visit  (Day  7), and a Final Follow -up visit (Day 28 [± 2 days]). 
Seven days prior to Randomization (Day -7), subjects will be administered ASA 81 mg orally once 
daily ( QD) until the  final dose on the morning of Day [ADDRESS_682502] a 6th dose of ticagrelor administered 24 hours after the 
initiation  of study drug in a subsequent cohort.  
Subjects will check in to the clini cal site ([COMPANY_003]) on Day -3. In the morning on Day -2, subjects will 
begin pretreatment with ticagrelor as described in the preceding paragraph. On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a ratio 3:1  
(PB2452 :placebo) , to receive an IV dose of PB2452 or placebo 2 hours following the 5
th ticagrelor 
dose. Subjects may be discharged from the clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will 
return for a Follow -up visit on Day 7, if already di scharged , and on Day 28 (± 2 days).  
Serum and plasma sampling times for PB2452, ticagrelor, and TAM PK and PD assessments will be 
described in a detailed Dosing Memo for each cohort. Hour 0 will be the time for initiation of study 
drug infusion (2 hours following administration of the 5th ticagrelor dose). PK and PD time points for 
subsequent cohorts may be adjusted as needed based on available PK, PD, and safety data from prior 
cohorts. In any cohort subsequent to Cohort 1, there will be no more than 6 additional sampling time 
points.  The written  Dosing Memo provided by [CONTACT_526053]:  
• Number of subjects to be randomized  
• Total PB2452 dose and administration regimen  
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part A  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 6 • Whether or not a 6th ticagrelor dose will be administered 24 hours after the 5th ticagrelor  dose  
• The PK and PD sampling schedule  
• Safety electrocardiogram ( ECG ) schedule  
• Biomarkers 
Safety and tolerability will be carefully monitored throughout the study. Immunogenicity samples 
will be collected from  all subjects at Baseline and at D ays 7 and 28 (±2 days ) following 
administration of study drug.  
Dose Escalation  
An SRC will be formed to conduct a blinded review of all safety and tolerability data (e.g., clinical 
laboratory test results, adverse events [AEs], ECGs , Holter monitoring report, vital signs) after each 
cohort- prior to initiation of a subsequent cohort. Escalation to a higher total dose of PB2452 will 
occur only if the SRC affirms the safety, tolerability, and absence of dose limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) in 
the preceding cohort(s).  
The SRC will be minimally composed of the on- site [COMPANY_003] investigator /medical monitor, P haseBio  
medical monitor, and PhaseBio clinical operations lead. Changes to the administration regimen (rate 
and duration) without escalation of the total dose or without increasing the infusion rate will not 
require formal SRC approval. Similarly, reductions in t he total dose or the infusion rate will not 
require SRC approval.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526020], pending investigation by [CONTACT_12217], if any of 
the following occur after confirmation the subject has received  PB2452: 
• Any preclinical or clinical events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], contraindicate further dosing of additional subjects with PB2452 
• Any serious adverse event  (SAE)  occurring prior to discharge from the clinical site   
• Data from previous cohorts indicate safety concerns for dosing at a higher level, such as 
unanticipated adverse responses (e.g., clinically significant  [CS]  changes in clinical 
laboratory test data, 12 lead ECG s, continuous 12- lead electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) 
results, vital signs, physical examinations) 
• Two or more subjects in a cohort experience any DLT, or [ADDRESS_682503] experiences a  
≥Grade 2 AE (DLT) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], warrants suspension of do se escalation  
• Two or more subjects have >3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or >[ADDRESS_682504] of bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) when no other reason can be found to explain the i ncreases  
• One or more subjects experiences a ≥Grade 2 infusion- related reaction (IRR) despi[INVESTIGATOR_526021]. Dosing may also be suspended if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_526022], any 
new or unexpected significant safety or tolerability issues related to ticagrelor or PB2452 are 
identified that warrant further evaluation before additional subjects are dosed. This may include 
emerging nonclinical data, clinically relevant AEs, or relevant data from other sources indicating safety concerns, even if the event(s) per se does not meet the protocol -specified definition of a DLT.

For Cohorts receiving a 6th dose of ticagrelor 24 hours following study drug initiation, AUC 0-48 will 
not be calculated  for neither  plasma PB2452 nor ticagrelor/TAM. The remaining PK parameters m ay 
be calculated for Days 1 and 2 separately.  Additional PK parameters may be generated , if needed.   
Details will be provided in a separate document, the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Urine PK  
Pooled urine samples to assess urine PB2452, ticagrelor , and TAM concentrations will be collected

Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-[ADDRESS_682529] AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
PB2452 (molecular weight 47.4 kDa) is a specific and selective recombinant human 
neutralizing antibody IgG1 λ monoclonal fragment antigen -binding antibody that binds with 
high affinity to ticagrelor and to AR-C124910XX (TAM), the major active circulating 
ticagrelor m etabolite . It is expressed in Escherichia  coli cells.  
PB2452 is intended to reverse the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in patients who  experience major bleeding or who require urgent surgery or intervention.  Platelet transfusion has appeared to be inferior to standard care for those taking antiplatelet therapy.
(Baharoglu,  2016)  
A strategy is needed to re- establish the integrity of the clotting cascade for the many patients 
who have abnormal coagulation due to pharmacological anticoagulation. (Beshay, 2010)  
Antiplatelet medications and anticoagulants pose a significant treatment dilemma since no direct reversal agents currently exist to reverse or mitigate antithrombotic properties .
(Dornbos  III, 
2018) Accordingl y, the current lack of an effective therapy to mitigate ticagrelor -induced 
platelet inhibition in patients who have life -threatening bleeding or require urgent surgery or 
intervention represents a significant unmet need. 
Ticagrelor is an orally available, direct -acting cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine, a selective and  
reversibly binding P2Y [ADDRESS_682530] .(Storey, 2007) TAM, the ticagrelor active metabolite 
(30% to 40% plasma exposure relative to parent in humans, (Storey , 2007)  has potency similar to 
ticagrelor versus P2Y 12. In addition to P2Y 12, ticagrelor also inhibits the equilibrative 
nucleoside transporter-1, thereby [CONTACT_526059] .(Armstrong , 2014; 
Beshay JE, Morgan H , Madden  C, Yu W, et al. Emergency reversal of anticoagulation and antiplatelet 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526025]. J Neurosurg 2010 Feb;112(2):307-18. 
Catteneo , 2014) Ticagrelor in combination with low- dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) is 
indicated for the prevention of thrombotic events (e.g., cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction [MI], and stroke) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. Ticagrelor also reduces the rate of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. In the management of ACS, ticagrelor treatment is initiated with a 180  mg 
loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily (bid) during the first year after an ACS event. After one year , the prescribed dosage is  decreased to  60 mg bid.
 
Therapy with ASA plus an oral antiplatelet agent such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], prasugrel, or ticagrelor is known as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Although DAPT is strongly recommended in the early management of patients experiencing an ACS event, it also increases the risk of bleeding.
(Storey, 2011)  Patients with ACS may require urgent or emergent coronar y artery by[CONTACT_526060], Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part A  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 24 graft (CABG) surgery. In such patients, DAPT is associated with a 2 -fold increase in risk of 
blood transfusion, a 5-fold increase in risk of reoperation, and a 50% increased risk of wound 
infection. (Bell, 2011; Fitchett, 2011)  Consequently, guidelines and guidance statements recommend 
the P2Y [ADDRESS_682531] be stopped ≥ 5 days prior to the procedure, a recommendation 
that is not possible in patients who require urgent surgery. 
There are no approved drugs or biological agents capable of reversing the P2Y 12 inhibition 
produced by [CONTACT_183072] P2Y 12 inhibitors; therefore, in the event of major bleeding in 
a patient on DAPT, there are limited treatment options. Although platelet transfusion restores 
platelet function in patients on A SA, (Taylor, 2013)  it does not reverse the antiplatelet effect of 
ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding.

inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration- and dose-dependent manner in vitro (in human platelet- rich plas ma) and in vivo (mouse and 
pig, dose-dependency data in mouse only). In mice d osed with ticagrelor to a 
supra therapeutic plasma exposure, those dosed with PB2452 before a tail cut had reduced 
bleeding to a degree  not statistically different from the observation  in mice not treated with 
ticagrelor . The activity in vitro and the rapid onset of effect observed in vivo translated to a 
reduction of bleeding in ticagrelor- treated mice to a degree  that was not statistically 
significantly different from mice not tr eated with ticagrelor . Detailed descriptions of the non-

profiles of PB2452 may be found in the Investigators ’ Brochure (IB) for PB2452. 
PB2452 appeared generally safe and well tolerated across a dose range of 0.1 g to 18 g. A 
total of 30 adverse events occurred after initiation of PB2452 or placebo and were reported by 19 of the 64 volunteers (30%). Of the 48 volunteers who received PB2452, 17 (35%) 
reported 27 adverse events; of the 16 volunteers who received placebo, 2 (12%) reported 3 
adverse events. There were no dose- limiting toxic ity (DLTs) effects or infusion- related 
reactions  (IRRs). There were no deaths or adverse events that led to discontinuation of the 
trial drug . One volunteer had 2 serious adverse events (alcohol poisoning and acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) [ADDRESS_682534] results, vital signs, and electrocardiographic results were similar across cohorts among volunteers who received different  doses or regimens of 
PB2452 and were similar among those who received PB2452 and those who received placebo. Of the 48 volunteers who received PB2452, 21 (44%) had detectable anti- drug 
antibodies in blood obtained 7 and/or 28 days after exposure; 15 (31%) had been positive before they received PB2452 and 6 (12%) became positive after they received PB2452, albeit 
with low titers of 40 (in 5 volunteers) and 160 (in 1 volunteer). Of the 16 volunteers who 
received placebo, 3 (19%) were positive for anti- drug a ntibodies, with 2 (12%) having 
preexisting antibodies. The presence of these antibodies had no observed effect on the safety 
or efficacy of PB2452. 
The PK  profile of PB2452 demonstrated that mean plasma concentrations of PB2452 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_183034]. In cohorts 1-3 when PB2452 was 
administered as a 30 -minute intravenous infusion in the absence of ticagrelor, elimination 
appeared to be biphasic with half-life values ranging from 1.5 to 9.2 hours for the dose range 
0.1 g to 1 g. In the presence and absence of ticagrelor, g eometric mean observed maximum 
plasma concentration  (C
max) values and geometric mean a rea under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve (AUC) from time zero extrapolated to infinity  (AUC 0-∞) )values of total 
PB2452 appeared to increase in a dose-proportional manner. The inter -individual variability 
(geometric mean coefficient of variation [ CV% ]) for C max and AUC 0-∞ was low, ranging from 
4.8% to 28.9% across Cohorts 1-3. PB2452 appeared to incre ase mean total plasma 
concentrations of ticagrelor and TAM compared to placebo, and this effect was dependent on the dose of PB2452.  Additionally, PB2452 increased the renal CL of ticagrelor and TAM in a 
dose-dependent manner.

25July2019 Page 26 The PD profile of PB2452 demonstrated that f or subjects receiving steady -state ticagrelor, IV 
infusion of PB2452 (3 to18 g) restored platelet activity to approximately 100% of baseline 
using multiple assays of platelet function . The onset of reversal was rapid, occurring at the 
first assessment of platelet function following initiation of PB2452 infusion (30 minutes in 
cohorts 4-6 and 5 minutes in cohorts 7-10). The duration of ticagrelor reversal appeared to be dependent on the total dose and infusion duration of PB2452.  
1.1.3 Benefit/Ris k Assessment  
The first in human study of PB2452 in healthy volunteers (PB2452- PT-CL-0001) 
demonstrated that PB2452 appears to be generally safe and well tolerated when administered 
intravenously across a dose range of 0.1- 18 g. The healthy volunteers who were 18- 50 years 
in age were not expected to nor received any  benefit fr om administration of PB2452. Platelet 
function analyses showed that PB2452 delivered immediate and sustained reversal of ticagrelor, occurring as early as 5 minutes after initiatio n of PB2452 infusions and lasting for 
20-24 hours. Rapid and sustained ticagrelor reversal by [CONTACT_183075]2452 may provide clinically significant benefit in patients taking ticagrelor who  experience serious bleeding or require 
urgent surgical procedures by [CONTACT_526061] g rapid  hemostasis  or prevention of procedure- related 
bleeding. 
Although treatment emergent adverse events associated with PB2452 in the Phase 1 study 
were mostly mild and infrequent with no infusion- related or hypersensitivity reactions 
observed, in the older and elderly subjects in this Phase 2A study, there remain potential risks of infusion- related  reactions (IRRs), infusion site reactions, and hypersensitivity- type 
reactions which can result from exposure to recombinant protein drugs administered intravenously (IV). These risks may be mitigated by [CONTACT_526062] . Risks may also be mitigated by 
[CONTACT_183078]2452 which will be implemented if a study subject develops a Grade ≥[ADDRESS_682535] is considered low and was not observed in the Phase 1 study.

1.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY 
Current recommendations for management of bleeding in patients treated with  
antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526026]; they are mostl y supportive and non- specific.  
Platelet transfusion, while useful for some antiplatelet agents, exposes patients to th e  
known risks of blood products. Further, t he efficacy of transfused platelets may be  
limited by [CONTACT_526063] , if present. Moreover,  
it has been demonstrated that platelet transfusions do not reverse the effects of ticagrelor .
(Dalen, 2013; Godier, 2015; Maillard, 2015; Teng, 2016)  
An agent to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_526027] -platelet aggregation (IPA) a ssociated with effects of  
ticagrelor , and the metabolite TAM,  would fulfill an important unmet clinical need for those 
patient s: 
• who have major bleeding with  ticagrelor possibly contributing 
• who are taking ticagrelor and require urgent surgery or intervention associated with a 
high risk of bleeding 
• who are taking ticagrelor for conditions with a high risk of thrombosis, require major surgery, and/or need  to minimize the time when  they are  not receiving ticagrelor 
1.[ADDRESS_682536] in human Phase 1 study of PB2452, 18 g administered as an initial 6 g bolus 
followed by a prolonged infusion of the remaining 12 g over 16 hours in healthy subjects aged 18- 50 years old was considered generally safe and well tolerated. There were no 
PB2452- related adverse effects, injection site reaction ( ISRs ), or DLTs observed as 
determined by [CONTACT_526064]. The profile of rapid and sustained ticagrelor reversal delivered by [CONTACT_941] 18 g dose level is potentially clinically meani ngful and considered 
ideal for patients on ticagrelor with acute major bleeding or who need urgent surgery.  
The 18 g dose level and prolonged infusion regimen administered in the Phase 1 study will 
be repeated in the current study in older and elderly subjects who are more similar in age and background comorbidities to the actual patient population treated with ticagrelor. Potentially longer infusions of PB2452 may be investigated in this study, using potentially higher  total 
doses of PB2452. To mitigate a ny risks related to dose escalation, a Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) will be assembled to review all emergent safety and tolerability data and available PK data after each cohort is completed to determine whether dose escalation and/or 
prolongation of infusion duration is warranted. PK/PD modeling will be used to simulate 
potential doses, infusion regimens, and C
max and AUC exposure profiles prior to dose-
escalation or adjustment of infusion regimen to ensure that no dose or infusion regimen

25July2019 Page 33 3. INVESTIGATION PLAN  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY  
This is Part A of a two -part Phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single 
dose, sequential group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of PB2452 vs 
matching placebo. Part A investigates various dose levels and regimens of PB2452 administered intravenously to older (ages 50 to 64 years) and elderly (ages 65 to 80 years) male and female subjects pretreated with ticagrelor + aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA) as part of dual antiplatelet therapy. Part B investigates various dose levels and regimens of PB2452 administered to healthy male and female subjects (ages 18 -50) pretreated with a high dose of 
ticagrelor alone (180 mg BID). Part B is described in a separate protocol document.   
In Part A described herein, up to 5 dose levels and/or administration regimens will be 
evaluated in up to 5 cohorts. Each cohort will include approximately  8 to 12 subjects 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio, PB2452:placebo. All references to study drug within the content of the protocol apply to PB2452 or matching  placebo.  
This initial cohort (Cohort 1) will include approximately 8 subjects ages 50 to 80 years pretreated with ASA + ticagrelor who will be randomized to 18 grams (g) of PB2452 or matching placebo administered as an initial 6 g bolus infused over 10 minutes, followed by 12 g infused over the next 15 hours and 50 minutes to complete a 16 hour administration regimen. This initial regimen was shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy young adults (18 to 50 years) in a prior Phase 1 study and provided immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. Following completion of Cohort 1, subsequent cohort(s) may test the same, higher, or lower dose levels, and/or different infusion regimens of PB2452 or matching placebo in the same population as in Cohort 1 or in different populations, such as, elderly subjects (65 to 80 years old) as determined by [CONTACT_526051](s). A written Dosing Memo provided by [CONTACT_526052], cohort population, cohort size, sampling schedules, and other cohort- specific study activities prior to initiation 
of each cohort. The maximum total dose of PB2452 administered to an y subject will not 
exceed 30g. Duration of study drug infusions will not exceed [ADDRESS_682541] of a Screening period (Days –45 to –4), a Check -in day (Day -3) and  
Pretreatment Period, an on -site Randomization/Treatment day (Day 1), 3 days on- site for 
treatment and safety monitoring, a Follow -up Visit (Day  7), and a Final Follow-up visit (Day 
28 [±2 days]). Seven days prior to Randomization (Day - 7), subjects will be administered 
ASA 81 mg orally once daily (QD) until the final dose on the morning of Day [ADDRESS_682542] a 6
th dose of ticagrelor administered  24 hours after the initiation of study drug 
in a subsequent cohort.  
Subjects will check in to the clinical site ([COMPANY_003]) on Day -3. In the morning on Day -2, 
subjects will begin pretreatment with ticagrelor as described in the preceding paragraph. On Day 1,  subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized in a ratio 3:1 (PB2452:placebo), to receive an IV dose of PB2452 or placebo 2 hours following the 5
th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from the c linical site 
between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7, if already discharged, and on Day 28  (±2 days).  
Serum and plasma sampling times for PB2452, ticagrelor, and TAM PK and PD assessments and urine sampling times for urinary PB2452, ticagrelor, and TAM concentrations will be described in a detailed Dosing Memo for each cohort. Hour 0 will be the time for initiation of 
study drug infusion (2 hours following administration of the 5th ticagrelor dose). PK and PD 
time poin ts for subsequent cohorts may be adjusted as needed based on available PK, PD, 
and safety data from prior cohorts. In any cohort subsequent to Cohort 1, there will be no more than 6 additional sampling time points.   
• For each cohort, the final dose level, administration regimen, PK/PD sampling and ECG schedule will be conveyed from the Sponsor to the clinical  site in a written 
Dosing Memo 1 to 2 weeks prior to initiation of each cohort, including the following instructions Number of subjects to be randomize d  
• Total PB2452 dose and administration regimen  
• Whether or not a 6th ticagrelor dose will be administered 24 hours after the 
5th ticagrelor  dose 
• The PK and PD sampling schedule  
• Safety ECG schedule  
Hour 0 on Day 1 for all PK/PD and safety assessment will be the initiation of study drug infusion (2 hours following administration of the 5
th ticagrelor dosing).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation  
The SRC will conduct a blinded review of all safety and tolerability data from a cohort at least through Day 3 (e.g., clinical laboratory results, AEs, ECGs, Holter monitoring reports if available, vital signs , and available PK data) and available data for each completed dose 
cohort and will document their review and assessment in written SRC minutes prior to initiation of a subsequent cohort. Dose escalation may occur o nly if the SRC affirms the dose 
and regimen from the previously completed cohorts were safe and well tolerated and no DLTs were observed.   
The SRC will be minimally composed of the on -site [COMPANY_003] investigator/medical monitor , 
PhaseBio  medical monitor, and PhaseBio clinical operations lead. Changes to the 
administration regimen (rate and duration) without escalation of the total dose or without

25July2019 Page 42 increases in the infusion rate will not require formal SRC approval. Similarly, reductions in 
the total dose or the infusion rate will not require SRC approval.  
The investigator may make a recommendation concerning whether the safety profile is 
sufficient to proceed to a higher  dose level, whether a pause in dosing for review of 
additional safety and/or PK data is needed , or whether adjustment of the dose of the next 
dose cohort is needed . The decision to adjust or pause the dose or proceed to the next cohort 
will be made by [CONTACT_12217].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -related or Allergic Reactions  
The administration of study drug infusion must be performed under supervision of trained medical staff and where facilities to handle allergic reactions are available. Should a subject  
experience symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_526029]  
e.g., lightheadedness, nausea, chills, fever
(Doessegger 2015)  the study drug infusion must be 
immediately and permanently discontinued. Should a subject experience symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_110412] (e.g., shortness of breath, anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema), the study drug administration must be immediately and permanently discontinued. Suspected IRRs will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria f or Adverse Events 
(CTCAE ) version 5.
(NCI CTCAE, v5, 2017)  Should any one subject develop a ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_682559] be administered premedication (diphenhydramine 25 mg by [CONTACT_1966] [ PO] + acetaminophen

To monitor for potential IRRs, vital signs, including BP, HR, Temp, RR, will be assessed at Baseline (prior to study d rug infusion), every [ADDRESS_682561] hour after initiation of the infusion. The remaining  assessments of vital signs will be performed as described in the Schedule of 
Events (Appendix 7.1). Suspected allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and anaphylaxis will 
be assessed according to the clinical diagnostic criteria outlined by [CONTACT_526070] v5 in  Appendix 7.3 (Definition and 
Management of Anaphylaxis ) and  Appendix 7.4 (Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing 
Anaphylaxis) . Subjects will receive appropriate medical treatment  for these and other 
medical concerns at the discretion of the investigator.

25July2019 Page 43 [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -limiting Toxicities  
The SRC will review all AEs and all laboratory and ECG Holter monitoring abnormalities 
according to CTCAE v5 to determine whether DLT  has been identified in a subject who is 
confirmed to have received PB2452. If the SRC determines an AE is related to administration of ticagrelor or another confirmed cause, the AE will not be considered a DLT. Definitions of DLT are:  
• Any AE assessed as ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_682562] received PB2452.  
• Any ≥ Grade 2 laboratory abnormality (outside the clinical laboratory normal reference 
range) that occurs in a subject confirmed to have received PB2452.  
• Note: For a Grade 2 electrolyte abnormality that spontaneously resolves to ≤Grade 1 
without intervention within 24 hours, the SRC may decide to exempt the laboratory 
abnormality from being considered a DLT.  
• Any treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) that leads to study withdrawal of a 
subject confirmed to have received PB2452. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526020], pending investigation by [CONTACT_12217], if 
any of the following occur after confirmation the subject has received PB2452: 
• Any preclinical or clinical events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], contraindicate further 
dosing of additional subjects with PB2452 
• Any serious AE (SAE) occurring prior to discharge from the clinical site  
• Data from previous cohorts indicate safety concerns for dosing at a higher level, such as unanticipated adverse responses (e.g., CS changes in clinical laboratory test data, ECGs  
Holter monitor ing results, vital signs, physical examinations)  
• Two or more subjects in a cohort experience any DLT, or [ADDRESS_682563] experiences  a ≥Grade 2 AE (DLT) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], warrants suspension of dose 
escalat ion 
• Two or more subjects have >[ADDRESS_682564] of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or >[ADDRESS_682565] of bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) when no other reason can be found to explain the increases 
• One or more subjects expe riences a ≥ Grade 2 IRR despi[INVESTIGATOR_526031] . 
Continuation of dosing following suspension will be determined by [CONTACT_526071]. Dosing may also be suspended if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_526022] , any new or unexpected significant safety or tolerability issues related to 
ticagrelor or PB2452 are identified that warrant further evaluation before additional subjects are dosed. This may include emerging nonclinical data, clinically relevant AEs, or relevant data from other sources indicating safety concerns, even if the event(s) per se does not meet the protocol-specified definition of a DLT.

3.5.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Definitions 
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs observed or reported during the study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. For the purposes of AE recording when relationship to study drug is assessed, study drug refers to PB2452 or placebo. A separate line on the eCRF is for assessing whether or not an AE is related to the administration of ticagrelor.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not it is considered drug- related. Subjects will be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_209786].  
A TEAE is defined as any AE not present before exposure to study drug or any AE already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure to study drug. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility the study 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug (IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “ adverse reaction,” which means any AE caused by a study drug.  
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part A  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 52 An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions when there are reasons to conclude the drug caused the event.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed with the study drug; or, if an IB is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “ Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs 
or suspected adverse reactions mentioned in the IB that occur with a certain class of drugs or as anticipated based on the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically 
mentioned as having occurred with the specific drug under investigation.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered an SAE/suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
•  Death  
•  Life-threatening AE  
•  Inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
•  Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
•  Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, may not be life threatening, or may not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ life threatening ” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_526035], its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE or suspe cted adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
Special attention will be given to DLTs and the MTD, if applicable. DLT is defined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The overall safety profile, including but not limited to DLT s and MTDs will be used 
in the selection of the starting dose(s) in future studies of PB2452 administered by [CONTACT_104482].

25July2019 Page 53 [IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and  Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF 
and reported to PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. From the time informed consent is signed through to completion of all study procedures and assessments at the Day 28 (±2  days ) visit, 
all AEs will be assessed.  
Subjects may spontaneously report and/or will be asked a standard question to elicit any medically related changes in their well -being. They will also be asked if they have used any 
new medications or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and OTC  medications).  
In addition to subject observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected on the AE page of the eCRF (e.g., laboratory values, physical examination  findings, ECG, Holter 
monitoring changes) or other documents relevant to subject safety . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatmen t, type of event, time of onset, dosage, 
investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. The AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_526075] s ignificant  (NCS). The current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs.  
Any medical condition present at the time the subject is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. Ho wever, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_11770] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
must be reported to the Sponsor immediately (after the investigator has confirmed the 
occurrence of the SAE). The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility the study drug caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE, as outlined in the US Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts [ADDRESS_682576] (IRB) directly.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_526076] ’s daily activities . Severity  will be classified as mild, 
moderate, or seve re using the following criteria:  
•  Mild:  These events require minimal to  no treatment and do not interfere with the 
subject ’s daily activities.  
•  Moderate:  These events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with normal 
functioning.  
•  Severe:  These events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Changes in the sever ity of an AE should be documented to allow assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity. An AE characterized as intermittent requires 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The CTCAE v5 grading scale will be used by [CONTACT_526077] s for subsequent study subjects. Additionally, CTCAE v5 will be 
used by [CONTACT_526078] a DLT and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526036].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship between an AE and study drug or ticagrelor is part of the documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
The investigator will assess causality of all AEs and SAEs (i.e., whether there is a reasonable certainty the study drug caused the event). The relationship between an AE and an SAE to study drug (and ticagrelor) will be characterized using the following classifications:   
•  Unrelated: This relationship suggests there is no association between study drug (or 
ticagrelor) and the reported event.  
•  Possible:  This relationship is based on evidence suggesting a causal relationship between 
the study drug (or ticagrelor) and the AE (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the event). The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration or the event follows a known response pattern to study drug (or ticagrelor ) but could also have been caused by [CONTACT_1604].  
•  Probable:  This relationship suggests a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with 
drug administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological action of the

25July2019 Page 55 drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of drugs, or 
judgment based on the investigator’ s clinical experience, the association of the event with 
study drug (or ticagrelor) seems likely.  
•  Definite:  This relationship suggests that a definite causal relation ship exists between 
study drug (or ticagrelor) administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Event s 
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page of the eCRF and followed until it 
is resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_11755] ( NCS ). 
3.5.3 Clinical Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by [CONTACT_526079]. Blood will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1) and will be 
prepared using standard procedures. Repeat clinical laboratory tests may be performed at the discretion of the investigator, if necessary, to evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria or clinical laboratory abnormalities. The clinical laboratory performing the tests will provide the reference ranges for all clinical laboratory parameters.

25July2019 Page 57 Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be flagged as either high or low (or normal or 
abnormal) based on the reference ranges for each laboratory parameter. The investigator will determine whether any of the abnormally high or low re sults are CS  or NCS . Clinical 
significance is defined as any variation in  results that has medical relevance and may result in 
an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, therapeutic measures). If a CS  change from the Screening value is noted, the CS value and etiology or 
reason for clinical significance will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional assessments until the values have reached either the reference range or the values at Screening or until the investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary . 
When schedule procedures overlap at the same time point (see Schedule of Events  (Appendix 7.1).  there must be planning to collect the specific information within the 
designated time window. Accordingly, the importance of these procedures is: 
1.  Blood collection (whether for PD, PK, immunology, or safety) should always be collected 
at the designated time point (if possible) . However, multiple collections (PD, PK, 
immunology, and safety) may be required at the same time  point. Therefore, the 
recommend ation is for blood to be drawn in this order: PD, PK, immunology, and safety 
(see lab collection manual from CirQuest for additional information related to collection of PD samples).  
2.  The 12-lead ECG Holter monitoring has a ± 10-minute  window (unless otherwise 
 designated in the Schedule of Events, [ Appendix 7.1]) when  this may be done, either 
 before or after blood collection.  
3.  If time permits, vital sign measurements  should be completed just prior to or just after  
 blood collection; this may be still be done within the designated window in the Schedule 
 of Events ( Appendix 7.1).  
3.5.4 Vital Signs Measurements 
Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events  
(Appendix 7.1).   
Vital sign measurements will include SBP, DBP, oral body temperature, RR, and HR. The subject will have rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] ≥10 min utes before all measurements are 
taken. Note:  Vital signs collected during the initial 30 minutes of infusion of study drug 
require only the BP and HR. 
The investigator will determine whether any of the vital sign measurements are CS or NCS . 
Clinical significance is defined as any variation in results that has medical relevance and may 
result in an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, therapeutic measures). If a CS change from Screening values is noted, the CS  value and  
reason for clinical significance will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional assessments until the value 
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-[ADDRESS_682578] has rested in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] ≥[ADDRESS_682579] abnormalities. In addition, 
measurements of these intervals will be reported: RR interval, PR interval, QRS width,  
and and QTcF   
The investigator will determine whether any of the 12- lead ECG results are CS or NCS. 
Clinical significance is defined as any variation in results that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, therapeutic measures). If a CS  change from Screening is noted, the CS value and reason for 
CS will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional assessments until either the values have reached either reference range or the values at Screening or until the investigator determines follow -up is no 
longer medically necessary.  
3.5.6 Holter Monitoring ( Continuous Twelve -lead ECG ) 
Holter monitoring (continuous 12-lead ECG recording) for 24 hours will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1) to monitor HR and rhythm 
activity as standard safety measurements. The clinical research site will be responsible for providing trained study personnel for setting up and managing the Holter m onitoring system 
to ensure that reports of Holter findings for each subject will be available for review at the safety review meeting for each cohort. The continuous ECG waveform data recorded by [CONTACT_526080]- response QTc analysis. The Holter 
monitoring system used will be maintained in accordance with the clinical research site SOPs.  
The SRC will determine if any of the Holter findings are CS at the safety review meetings. Clinical significance  is defined as any variation in results that has medical relevance and may 
result  in an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, 
therapeutic measures).

25July2019 Page 59 If a CS finding from the Holter report is noted, the CS findings and etiology or reason f or 
clinical significance will be documented in the AE page of the eCRF. The SRC may 
recommend repeat Holter monitoring during the 28- day safety period if clinically indicated.  
3.5.7 Physical Examinations  
A physical examination will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1).   
A full physical examination will include assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities.  
A brief physical examination will include assessment of  skin (including any signs of 
cutaneous erythema), lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver, spleen). Interim physical examinations will be performed at the discretion of the investigator,  if necessary, to 
evaluate AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities. Height and weight will be measured , and 
BMI  will be calculated at Screening and at Day 28 (±2 days).  
3.5.8 Infusion Site Assessments 
The infusion site will be examined by [CONTACT_526081]ée concerning pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling, as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 7.1).  Infusion site reactions will be assessed according to the CTCAE v5 grading 
scale and will be recorded as AEs; these should be followed until resolution. 
3.5.9 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Immunogenicity (antibody) samples will be screened for the presence of binding anti- drug 
antibodies (ADA) at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1).  
Results of immunogenicity samples taken prior to administering study drug do not need to be available prior to dosing nor to confirm subject eligibility. A subject who tests positive for ADAs at the final scheduled visit (Day 28 ±2 days) will be asked to return for follow-up sampling approximately [ADDRESS_682580] positive or until levels return to a predose state. 
3.6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
3.6.1 Sample Size Calcul ations 
The sample size (N) of up to 5 cohorts of approximately for this study is based on clinical and practical considerations rather than  on formal statistical power calculation. The sample

* In successive cohorts following Cohort 1, if indicated in a Dosing Memo from Sponsor to site, one or more 
cohorts may also receive a 6th dose of ticagrelor 90 mg, 24  hours after initiation of PB2452 (or placebo) 
infusion on Day 1.  
** Modifications to this schedule may be made in a Dosing Memo from Sponsor to site prior to initiation of 
each cohort. For cohorts receiving a 6th ticagrelor dose only: Sampling times will be specified in a Dosing 
Memo from Sponsor to site.  
*** Modifications to this schedule may be made in a Dosing Memo from Sponsor to site prior to initiation of 
each cohort. For cohorts receiving a 6th ticagrelor dose only: P ooled urine samples to assess urine ticagrelor and 
TAM concentrations will be collected over the following intervals beginning with the 6th ticagrelor dose: 0 to 6, 
6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours.  
a=Screening Period=Days -45 to - 4 (including Day -7, when ASA is started).  
b=Serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

STUDY PHASE: 2A 
STUDY SITE: 1 clinical site in the [LOCATION_002]: [COMPANY_003] Phase 1 Clinic, 7551 Metro Center Driv e, 
Suite 200, Austin, [LOCATION_007] [ZIP_CODE] 
INDICATION:  Reversal of  ticagrelor  anti-platelet activity  
DURATION OF STUDY:  The estimated duration of the study for each subject, excluding 
Screening, is approximately 35  days.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary : 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (IV) doses of PB2452 vs matching placebo 
with a high -dose of oral ticagrelor (180 mg BID) pretreatment in healthy subjects  
• To assess the efficacy /pharmacodynamics (PD) of IV doses of PB2452 vs matching placebo in 
reversing  a high dose of ticagrelor ’s antiplatelet activity by [CONTACT_35755] P2Y 12 reaction units (PRU) 
with VerifyNow® P2Y 12 assay in healthy subjects     
Secondary : 
• To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PB2452 in the presence of a high dose of ticagrelor  
• To determine the PK of ticagrelor and the ticagrelor active metabolite AR -C124910XX (TAM) in 
the presence of PB2452  
• To evaluate the effect of PB2452 on ticagrelor antiplatelet activity by [CONTACT_526088] (LTA) and platelet reactivity index (PRI)  
with vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) assay by [CONTACT_28745]-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA)  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity potential of PB2452 
Exploratory : 
• To evaluate the effect of PB2452 on the PK profile of unbound ticagrelor and unbound TAM plasma concentrations 
• To investigate the effect of PB2452 vs matching placebo on circulating biomarkers of platelet activation, such as P -selectin, in subjects pretreated with  high -dose ticagre lor 
• To examine the correlation between estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) and the  PK of 
ticagrelor and TAM.  
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
This is Part B of a two-part Phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, single dose, 
sequential group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK , and PD of PB2452 vs matching 
placebo. Part A investigated various dose regimens of PB2452 administered intravenously to older (ages 50 to 64 years) and elderly (ages 65 to 80 years) male and female subjects pretreated with 
ticagrelor + aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA) as part of dual antiplatelet therapy . Part B investigates various dose levels 
and regimens of PB2452 administered to healthy male and female subjects (ages 18 -50) pretreated 
with a high dose of ticagrelor alone (180 mg) twice daily (BID). Part A is described in a separate 
protocol document.  
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part B  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 5 In Part B described herein, up to 3 dose levels and/or administration regimens of PB2452 will be 
evaluated in up to 3 cohorts. Each cohort will include up  to 12 subjects randomized in a 3:1 ratio  
(PB2452:placebo). All references to study drug within the content of the protocol apply to PB2452 or 
matching placebo. 
This initial cohort of Part B  will include healthy subjects pretreated with 180 mg of oral ticagrelor 
twice daily  for 48 hours prior to randomization to a dose and regimen of PB2452 ( or matching 
placebo) described in a cohort- specific Dosing Memo . The written Dosing Memo provided by [CONTACT_526089], cohort size, sampling schedules, 
and other cohort -specific study activities prior to initiation of each cohort. The dose level of the initial 
regimen in Part B w ill not exceed twice the total dose level (36 g) shown to be safe and well tolerated 
in older and elderly subjects (50-80 years) in Part A of this Phase 2A study and in the Phase 1 study 
of PB2452 in healthy subjects (PB2452- PT-CL-0001).  
Following completion of Cohort 3, subsequent cohort(s) may  test the same, higher or lower dose 
levels, and/or different  infusion regimens of PB2452 or matching placebo as determi ned by [CONTACT_526090](s) and described in a 
subsequent Dosing Memo . Duration of study drug infusions will not exceed 48 hours.  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all available s afety data from ongoing or completed 
cohorts and will document their review and assessment in written SRC minutes prior to initiation of a 
subsequent cohort. Dose escalation may occur only if the SRC affirms the dose and regimen from the previously completed cohorts were safe and well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities  (DLTs ) 
were observed.  
The study will consist of a Screening period (Days –45 to –4), a Check -in day (Day -3), a 48 hour 
Pretreatment Period  starting on Day -2, an on-site Randomization/Treatment day (Day 1), 3 days on-
site for treatment and safety monitoring, a Follow -up Visit  (Day  7), and a Final Follow -up Visit (Day 
28 [±2 days]). Two days prior to Randomization (Day -2), subjects will be administered ticagrelor 
180 mg orally twice  daily ( BID) until the  final dose on the morning of Day [ADDRESS_682608] ticagrelor 180  mg oral dose will be administered on the morning of Day -2 followed by 
180 mg every 12 hours until the 5
th dose has been administered on the morning of Day 1.   
Subjects will check in to the clinical site ([COMPANY_003]) on Day -3. In the morning on Day -2, subjects will 
begin pretreatment with ticagrelor as described in the preceding paragraph. On Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a ratio 3:1 (PB2452 :placebo) , to receive an IV dose of PB2452 or placebo 2 hours following the 5
th ticagrelor 
dose. Subjects may be discharged from the clinical site between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will 
return for a Follow -up visit on Day 7, if already discharged , and on Day 28 (± 2 days).  
Serum and plasma sampling times for PB2452, ticagrelor, and TAM PK and PD assessments will be 
described in the  detailed Dosing Memo for each cohort. Hour 0 will be the time for initiation of study 
drug infusion (2 hours following administration of the 5th ticagrelor dose). PK and PD time points for 
subsequent cohorts may be adjusted as needed based on available PK, PD, and safety data from prior cohorts. In any cohort subsequent to the initial cohort in Part B , there will be no more than 
6 additional sampling time points.  The written  Dosing Memo provided by [CONTACT_526091]: 
• Number of subjects to be randomized  
• Total PB2452 dose and administration regimen  
• The PK and PD sampling schedule  
• Safety ECG schedule  
• Biomarkers schedule

Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part B  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 6 Safety and tolerability will be carefully monitored throughout the study. Immunogenicity samples 
will be collected from  all subjects at Baseline and at D ays 7 and 28 (±2 days ) following 
administration of study drug.  
Dose Escalation  
The SRC will conduct a blinded review of all safety and tolerability data from a cohort at least 
through Day 3 (e.g., clinical laboratory test results, adverse events [AEs], ECGs , Holter monitoring 
report, vit al signs)  prior to initiation of a subsequent cohort . Escalation to a higher total dose of 
PB2452 will occur only if the SRC affirms the safety, tolerability, and absence of DLTs in the 
preceding cohort(s).  
The SRC will be minimally composed of the on- site [COMPANY_003] investigator /medical monitor, P haseBio  
medical monitor, and PhaseBio clinical operations lead. Changes to the administration regimen (rate 
and duration) without escalation of the total dose or without increasing the infusion rate will not 
require formal SRC approval. Similarly, reductions in the total dose or the infusion rate will not require SRC approval.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526020], pending investigation by [CONTACT_12217], if any of the following occur afte r confirmation the subject has received  PB2452: 
• Any preclinical or clinical events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], contraindicate further dosing of additional subjects with PB2452 
• Any serious AE (SAE)  occurring prior to discharge from the clinical site  
• Data from previous cohorts indicate safety concerns for dosing at a higher level, such as 
unanticipated adverse responses (e.g., clinically significant  [CS]  changes in clinical 
laboratory test data, 12 lead ECG s, continuous 12- lead electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) 
results, vital signs, physical examinations) 
• Two or more subjects in a cohort experience any DLT, or [ADDRESS_682609] experiences a

Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-[ADDRESS_682633] AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
PB2452 (molecular weight 47.4 kDa) is a specific and selective recombinant human 
neutralizing antibody IgG1 λ monoclonal fragment antigen -binding antibody that binds with 
high affinity to ticagrelor and to AR-C124910XX (TAM), the major active circulating 
ticagrelor m etabolite . It is expressed in Escherichia  coli cells.  
PB2452 is intended to reverse the antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor in patients who  experience major bleeding or who require urgent surgery or intervention.  Platelet transfusion has appeared to be inferior to standard care for those taking antiplatelet therapy.
(Baharoglu,  2016)  
A strategy is needed to re- establish the integrity of the clotting cascade for the many patients 
who have abnormal coagulation due to pharmacological anticoagulation. (Beshay, 2010)  
Antiplatelet medications and anticoagulants pose a significant treatment dilemma since no direct reversal agents currently exist to reverse or mitigate antithrombotic properties .
(Dornbos  III, 
2018) Accordingl y, the current lack of an effective therapy to mitigate ticagrelor -induced 
platelet inhibition in patients who have life -threatening bleeding or require urgent surgery or 
intervention represents a significant unmet need. 
Ticagrelor is an orally available, direct -acting cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine, a selective and  
reversibly binding P2Y [ADDRESS_682634] .(Storey, 2007) TAM, the ticagrelor active metabolite 
(30% to 40% plasma exposure relative to parent in humans, (Storey , 2007)  has potency similar to 
ticagrelor versus P2Y 12. In addition to P2Y 12, ticagrelor also inhibits the equilibrative 
nucleoside transporter-1, thereby [CONTACT_526059] .(Armstrong , 2014; 
Beshay JE, Morgan H , Madden  C, Yu W, et al. Emergency reversal of anticoagulation and antiplatelet 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526025]. J Neurosurg 2010 Feb;112(2):307-18. 
Catteneo , 2014) Ticagrelor in combination with low- dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (acetylsalicylic acid; ASA) is 
indicated for the prevention of thrombotic events (e.g., cardiovascular death, myocardial 
infarction [MI], and stroke) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. Ticagrelor also reduces the rate of stent thrombosis in patients who have been stented for treatment of ACS. In the management of ACS, ticagrelor treatment is initiated with a 180  mg 
loading dose, followed by 90 mg twice daily (bid) during the first year after an ACS event. After one year , the prescribed dosage is  decreased to  60 mg bid.
 
Therapy with ASA plus an oral antiplatelet agent such as clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], prasugrel, or ticagrelor is known as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Although DAPT is strongly recommended in the early management of patients experiencing an ACS event, it also increases the risk of bleeding.
(Storey, 2011)  Patients with ACS may require urgent or emergent coronar y artery by[CONTACT_526060], Inc             PB2452

25July2019 Page 23 graft (CABG) surgery. In such patients, DAPT is associated with a 2 -fold increase in risk of 
blood transfusion, a 5-fold increase in risk of reoperation, and a 50% increased risk of wound 
infection. (Bell, 2011; Fitchett, 2011)  Consequently, guidelines and guidance statements recommend 
the P2Y [ADDRESS_682635] be stopped ≥ 5 days prior to the procedure, a recommendation 
that is not possible in patients who require urgent surgery. 
There are no approved drugs or biological agents capable of reversing the P2Y 12 inhibition 
produced by [CONTACT_183072] P2Y 12 inhibitors; therefore, in the event of major bleeding in 
a patient on DAPT, there are limited treatment options. Although platelet transfusion restores 
platelet function in patients on A SA, (Taylor, 2013)  it does not reverse the antiplatelet effect of 
ticagrelor in healthy volunteers and is unlikely to be of clinical benefit in patients with bleeding.

profiles of PB2452 may be found in the Investigators ’ Brochure (IB) for PB2452. 
PB2452 appeared generally safe and well tolerated across a dose range of 0.1 g to 18 g. A 
total of 30 adverse events occurred after initiation of PB2452 or placebo and were reported by 19 of the 64 volunteers (30%). Of the 48 volunteers who received PB2452, 17 (35%) 
reported 27 adverse events; of the 16 volunteers who received placebo, 2 (12%) reported 3 
adverse events. There were no dose- limiting toxic ity (DLTs) effects or infusion- related 
reactions  (IRRs). There were no deaths or adverse events that led to discontinuation of the 
trial drug . One volunteer had 2 serious adverse events (alcohol poisoning and acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) [ADDRESS_682638] results, vital signs, and electrocardiographic results were similar across cohorts among volunteers who received different  doses or regimens of 
PB2452 and were similar among those who received PB2452 and those who received placebo. Of the 48 volunteers who received PB2452, 21 (44%) had detectable anti- drug 
antibodies in blood obtained 7 and/or 28 days after exposure; 15 (31%) had been positive before they received PB2452 and 6 (12%) became positive after they received PB2452, albeit 
with low titers of 40 (in 5 volunteers) and 160 (in 1 volunteer). Of the 16 volunteers who 
received placebo, 3 (19%) were positive for anti- drug a ntibodies, with 2 (12%) having 
preexisting antibodies. The presence of these antibodies had no observed effect on the safety 
or efficacy of PB2452. 
The PK  profile of PB2452 demonstrated that mean plasma concentrations of PB2452 rapi[INVESTIGATOR_183034]. In cohorts 1-3 when PB2452 was 
administered as a 30 -minute intravenous infusion in the absence of ticagrelor, elimination 
appeared to be biphasic with half-life values ranging from 1.5 to 9.2 hours for the dose range 
0.1 g to 1 g. In the presence and absence of ticagrelor, g eometric mean observed maximum 
plasma concentration  (C
max) values and geometric mean a rea under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve (AUC) from time zero extrapolated to infinity  (AUC 0-∞) )values of total 
PB2452 appeared to increase in a dose-proportional manner. The inter -individual variability 
(geometric mean coefficient of variation [ CV% ]) for C max and AUC 0-∞ was low, ranging from 
4.8% to 28.9% across Cohorts 1-3. PB2452 appeared to incre ase mean total plasma 
concentrations of ticagrelor and TAM compared to placebo, and this effect was dependent on the dose of PB2452.  Additionally, PB2452 increased the renal CL of ticagrelor and TAM in a 
dose-dependent manner.

25July2019 Page 25 The PD profile of PB2452 demonstrated that f or subjects receiving steady -state ticagrelor, IV 
infusion of PB2452 (3 to18 g) restored platelet activity to approximately 100% of baseline 
using multiple assays of platelet function . The onset of reversal was rapid, occurring at the 
first assessment of platelet function following initiation of PB2452 infusion (30 minutes in 
cohorts 4-6 and 5 minutes in cohorts 7-10). The duration of ticagrelor reversal appeared to be dependent on the total dose and infusion duration of PB2452.  
1.1.3 Benefit/Ris k Assessment  
The first in human study of PB2452 in healthy volunteers (PB2452- PT-CL-0001) 
demonstrated that PB2452 appears to be generally safe and well tolerated when administered 
intravenously across a dose range of 0.1- 18 g. The healthy volunteers who were 18- 50 years 
in age were not expected to receive any  benefit fr om administration of PB2452. Platelet 
function analyses showed that PB2452 delivered immediate and sustained reversal of ticagrelor, occurring as early as 5 minutes after initiation of PB2452 infusions and lasting for 20-24 hours. Rapid and sustained ticagrelor reversal by [CONTACT_183075]2452 may provide clinically significant benefit in patients taking ticagrelor who  experience serious bleeding or require 
urgent surgical procedures by [CONTACT_526095]- related 
bleeding. 
Although treatment emergent adverse events associated with PB2452 in the Phase 1 study 
were mostly mild and infrequent with no infusion- related or hypersensitivity reactions 
observed, in the older and elderly subjects in this Phase 2A study, there remain potential risks of infusion- related  reactions (IRRs), infusion site reactions, and hypersensitivity- type 
reactions which can result from exposure to recombinant protein drugs administered intravenously (IV). These risks may be mitigated by [CONTACT_526062] . Risks may also be mitigated by 
[CONTACT_183078]2452 which will be implemented if a study subject develops a Grade ≥2 IRR.  
The healthy  subjects in Part B of this study will be administered a high -dose of ticagrelor 
(180 mg BID) which is expect ed to cause a dose-dependent increase in exposure compared to 
the [ADDRESS_682639] carries a risk of bleeding. However, in a ticagrelor study in atherosclerosis patients, the elevated exposures from 180 mg BID of ticagrelor demonstrated no apparent increase in bleeding compared to patients treated with ticagrelor 90 mg BID (Storey et al. DISPERSE-2 JACC 2007; 50: 1852-6). Based on the patient data and because the duration of high- dose ticagrelor treatment in Part B of this study 
is only [ADDRESS_682640] is considered low and was not observed in the Phase 1 study.  
Based on available information concern ing the risks of PB2452 and the precautions included 
in this clinical study, the risks are considered acceptable.  
1.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY 
Current recommendations for management of bleeding in patients treated with  antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_526026]; they are mostl y supportive and non- specific.  
Platelet transfusion, while useful for some antiplatelet agents, exposes patients to th e  
known risks of blood products. Further, t he efficacy of transfused platelets may be  
limited by [CONTACT_526096] , if present. Moreover,  
it has been demonstrated that platelet transfusions do not reverse the effects of ticagrelor .
(Dalen, 2013; Godier, 2015; Maillard, 2015; Teng, 2016)  
An agent to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_526027] -platelet aggregation (IPA) associated with effects of  
ticagrelor , and the metabolite TAM,  would fulfill an important unmet clinical need for those 
patient s: 
• who have major bleeding with  ticagrelor possibly contributing 
• who are taking ticagrelor and require urgent surge ry or intervention associated with a 
high risk of bleeding 
• who are taking ticagrelor for conditions with a high risk of thrombosis, require major 
surgery, and/or need  to minimize the time when  they are  not receiving ticagrelor 
1.[ADDRESS_682641] in human Phase 1 study of PB2452, 18 g administered as an initial 6 g bolus 
followed by a prolonged infusion of the remaining 12 g over 16 hours in healthy subjects aged 18- 50 years old was considered generally safe and well tolerated. There were no 
PB2452- related adverse effects, ISRs , or DLTs observed as determined by [CONTACT_526097]. The profile of rapid and sustained ticagrelor reversal delivered by [CONTACT_941] 18 g dose level is potentially clinically meaningful and considered ideal for patients on ticagrelor with acute major bleeding or who need urgent surgery.  
The 18 g dose level and prolonged infusion regimen administered in the Phase 1 study will 
be repeated in the current study in older and elderly subjects who are more similar in age and background comorbidities to the actual patient population treated with ticagrelor. Potentially

25July2019 Page 27 longer infusions of PB2452 may be investigated in this study, using potentially high total 
doses of PB2452. To mitigate any risks related t o dose escalation, a Safety Review 
Committee (SRC) will be assembled to review all emergent safety and tolerability data and available PK data after each cohort is completed to determine whether dose escalation and/or prolongation of infusion duration is w arranted. PK/PD modeling will be used to simulate 
potential doses, infusion regimens, and C
max and AUC exposure profiles prior to dose-
escalation or adjustment of infusion regimen to ensure that no dose or infusion regimen investigated in this study will e xceed C
max or AUC exposures achieved at the no observed 
adverse effect level ( NOAEL) in GLP toxicity study in rats.  
In the rat GLP toxicity study, there were no adverse effects observed following single doses 
of PB2452 at the highest dose level tested of 2000 mg/kg  given IV , alone or in combination 
with oral ticagrelor (20  mg/kg). Therefore, 2000 mg/kg was considered NOAEL  with a 
maximum plasma concentration  (Cmax) of [ZIP_CODE] µg/mL and  an area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve from time zero  extrapolated to infinity ( AUC 0-∞) of [ZIP_CODE] 
µg*h/mL.  
One or more doses and administration regimens of PB2452 will be tested in Part B to identify 
an approach to reverse a high oral dose of ticagrelor (180 mg BID). In a previous study of ticagrelor, co -administration of ticagrelor with CYP3A inhibitors resulted in higher exposure 
to ticagrelor and lower exposure to its active metabolite (Teng et al 2013).  Similar increases 
in exposure were reported in ACS patients who were treated with oral 180 mg ticagrelor twice daily. In the patient population, the elevated exposures from this high dose of ticagrelor resulted in a dose-dependent increase in inhibition of platelet aggregation but no apparent increase in bleeding compared to patients treated with ticagrelor 90 mg BID ( Cannon et al. 
2007 and Storey et al. 2007).

3.1 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY  
This is Part B of a Phase 2A, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, 
sequential group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of PB2452 vs matching placebo with ticagrelor pretreatment. Various dose levels and/or administration regimens of 
PB2452 may be administered to healthy male and female subjects 18- 50 years old. All 
references to study drug within the content of the protocol apply to PB2452 or 
matching  placebo.  
In Part B up to 3 dose levels and/or administration regimens of PB2452 will be evaluated in 
up to 3 cohorts. Each cohort will include up to 12 subjects randomized in a 3:1 ratio 
(PB2452:placebo).  
This initial cohort of Part B (Cohort 3) will pretreat subjects with 180 mg of oral ticagrelor 
twice daily for 48 hours prior to randomization to a dose and regimen of PB2452 or matching placebo described in a cohort-specific Dosing Memo. The written Dosing Memo provided by 
[CONTACT_526098], cohort size, 
sampling schedules, and other cohort- specific study activities prior to initiation of each 
cohort. The dose level of the initial regimen in Part B will not exceed twice the total dose 
level (36 g) shown to be safe and well tolerated in older and elderly subjects (50 -80 years) in 
Part A of this Phase 2A study and in the Phase 1 study of PB2452 in healthy subjects 
(PB2452- PT-CL-0001). 
Following completion of Cohort 3, subsequent cohort(s) may test the same, higher or lower dose levels, and/or different infusion regimens of PB2452 or matching placebo in the same 
population as in Cohort 3, or in different populations such as elderly subjects (65 to 80 years 
old), as determined by [CONTACT_526051](s) and described in a subsequent Dosing Memo. Duration of study drug infusions will not exceed 48 hours.  
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will review all available safety data from ongoing or 
completed co horts and will document their review and assessment in written SRC minutes 
prior to initiation of a subsequent cohort. Dose escalation may occur only if the SRC affirms the dose and regimen from the previously completed cohorts were safe and well tolerated and 
no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed.  
The study will consist of a Screening period (Days –45 to –4), a Check -in day (Day -3), a 48 
hour Pretreatment Period starting on Day -2, an on- site Randomization/Treatment day (Day 
1), 3 days on- site for treatment and safety monitoring, a Follow- up Visit (Day  7), and a Final 
Follow-up visit (Day 28 [±2 days]). Two days prior to Randomization (Day - 2), subjects will 
be administered ticagrelor 180 mg orally twice daily (BID) until the final dose on the 
morning of Day [ADDRESS_682645] ticagrelor 180  mg oral dose will be

25July2019 Page 32 administered on the morning of Day -2 followed by 180 mg every 12 hours until the 5th dose 
has been administered on the morning of Day 1.   
Subjects will check in to the clinical site ([COMPANY_003]) on Day -3. In the morning on Day -2, 
subjects will begin pretreatment with ticagrelor as described in the preceding paragraph. On 
Day 1, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomized in a ratio 3:1 (PB2452:placebo), to receive an IV dose of PB2452 or placebo 2 hours following the 5
th ticagrelor dose. Subjects may be discharged from the clinical site 
between Days 3 and 7 inclusive and will return for a Follow-up visit on Day 7, if already 
discharged, and on Day 28  (±2 days).  
Serum and plasma sampling times for PB2452, ticagrelor, and TAM PK and PD assessments 
will be described in the detailed Dosing Memo for each cohort. Hour 0 will be the time for initiation of study drug infusio n (2 hours following administration of the 5
th ticagrelor dose). 
PK and PD time points for subsequent cohorts may be adjusted as needed based on available PK, PD, and safety data from prior cohorts. In any cohort subsequent to Cohort 3, there will be no more than 6  additional sampling time points.  The written Dosing Memo provided by 
[CONTACT_526099]: 
• Number of subjects to be randomized  
• Total PB2452 dose and administration regimen  
• The P K and PD sampling schedule  
• Safety ECG schedule  
• Biomarkers  schedule 
Safety and tolerability will be carefully monitored throughout the study. Immunogenicity samples will be collected from all subjects at Day -3, Randomization , Days 7 and 28 (±2 
days) following administration of study drug.  
3.2 SELECTION OF STUDY P OPULATION 
Male or female subjects will be evaluated in up to 3 cohorts in the US, North America . To 
ensure the study clinic has sufficient subjects available for dosing for any cohort, additional 
subjects may be asked to present to the clinic for check in. The number of subjects brought in for check -in and pre-dosed with ticagrelor will be at the discretion of the study clinic 
personnel/principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_526043] e is a sufficient number of subjects available 
for dosing with study drug for a given cohort. Subjects who check in to the clinic may be dosed with ticagrelor in preparation for dosing with the study drug according to the S chedule 
of Events (Appendix 7.1). Extra subjects may be dosed with ticagrelor, so on the day of randomization there is a sufficient number of subjects available to fill the cohort.

3.4 STUDY TREATMENTS  
3.4.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
On Study Day 1 eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with either PB2452 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio, PB2452:placebo.  
3.4.2 Treatments Administered  
PB2452: 
PB2452 IV infusion, prepared according to the Pharmacy Manual, will be administered on 
Day 1  for up to 48 hours. For each cohort, the dose, infusion rate, and duration will 
be communicated from the Sponsor to the study site , [COMPANY_003],  in a Dosing Memo issued prior to 
initiation of each treatment co hort.  
Matching Placebo: 
0.9% sodium chloride single IV infusion, administered on Day 1, will be delivered at a rate 
and volume matching the active infusion.  
Ticagrelor: 
Ticagrelor 90 mg oral tablet s (immediate release)  administered as 180 mg  
(2 × 90 mg tablets) every 12 hours for 5 total doses.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation  
The SRC will conduct a blinded review of all safety and tolerability data from a cohort at 
least through Day 3 (e.g., clinical laboratory results, AEs, ECGs, Holter monitoring reports if available, vital signs , and available PK data) and available data for each completed dose 
cohort and will document their review and assessment in written SRC minutes prior to initiation of a subsequent cohort. Dose escalation may occur only if the SRC affirms the dose and regimen from the previously completed cohorts were safe and well tolerated and no DLTs were observed.   
The SRC will be minimally composed of the on -site [COMPANY_003] investigator/medical monitor , 
PhaseBio  medical monitor, and PhaseBio clinical o perations lead. Changes to the 
administration regimen (rate and duration) without escalation of the total dose or without

Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part B  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 38 increases in the infusion rate will not require formal SRC approval. Similarly, reductions in 
the total dose or the infusion rate will not require SRC approval.  
The investigator may make a recommendation concerning whether the safety profile is 
sufficient to proceed to a higher  dose level, whether a pause in dosing for review of 
additional safety and/or PK data is needed , or whether adjustment of the dose of the next 
dose cohort is needed . The decision to adjust or pause the dose or proceed to the next cohort 
will be made by [CONTACT_12217].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion -related or Allergic Reactions  
The administration of study drug infusion must be performed under supervision of trained medical staff and where facilities to handle allergic reactions are available. Should a subject  
experience symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_526029]  
e.g., lightheadedness, nausea, chills, fever
(Doessegger 2015)  the study drug infusion must be 
immediately and permanently discontinued. Should a subject experience symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_110412] (e.g., shortness of breath, anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema), the study drug administration must be immediately and permanently discontinued. Suspected IRRs will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) version 5.
(NCI CTCAE, v5, 2017)  Should any one subject develop a ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_682660] be administered premedication (diphenhydramine 25 mg by [CONTACT_1966] [ PO] + acetaminophen 
650 mg PO) 30 to 60 minutes prior to receiving study drug to mitigate the risk of IRR. If any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_526030]2452 (after unblinding) develops a ≥Grade [ADDRESS_682661] be premedicated (as described above) 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration of study drug.  To monitor for potential IRRs, vital signs, including BP, HR, Temp, RR, will be assessed at Baseline (prior to study drug infusion), every [ADDRESS_682662] hour after initiation of the infusion. The remaining  assessments of vital signs will be performed as described in the Schedule of 
Events ( Appendix 7.1). Sus pected allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions and anaphylaxis will 
be assessed according to the clinical diagnostic criteria outlined by [CONTACT_526100] v5 in  Appendix 0 (Definition and 
Management of Anaphylaxis ) and  Appendix 7.4 (Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing 
Anaphylaxis) . Subjects will receive appropriate medical treatment  for these and other 
medical concerns at the discretion of the investigator.

25July2019 Page 39 [IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -limiting Toxicities  
The SRC will review all AEs and all laboratory and ECG Holter monitoring abnormalities 
according to CTCAE v5 to determine whether DLT  has been identified in a subject who is 
confirmed to have received PB2452. If the SRC determines an AE is related to administration of ticagrelor or another confirmed cause, the AE will not be considered a DLT. Definitions of DLT are:  
• Any AE assessed as ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_682663] received PB2452.  
• Any ≥ Grade 2 laboratory abnormality (outside the clinical laboratory normal reference 
range) that occurs in a subject confirmed to have received PB24 52.  
• Note: For a Grade 2 electrolyte abnormality that spontaneously resolves to ≤Grade 1 
without intervention within 24 hours, the SRC may decide to exempt the laboratory 
abnormality from being considered a DLT.  
• Any treatment -emergent adverse event ( TEAE ) that leads to study withdrawal of a 
subject confirmed to have received PB2452. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526020], pending investigation by [CONTACT_12217], if 
any of the following occur after confirmation the subject has rec eived  PB2452: 
• Any preclinical or clinical events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], contraindicate further 
dosing of additional subjects with PB2452 
• Any serious AE (SAE) occurring prior to discharge from the clinical site  
• Data from previous cohorts indicate safety concerns for dosing at a higher level, such as unanticipated adverse responses (e.g., CS changes in clinical laboratory test data, ECGs  
Holter monitor ing results, vital signs, physical examinations)  
• Two or more subjects in a cohort experience any DLT, or [ADDRESS_682664] experiences  a ≥Grade 2 AE (DLT) that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], warrants suspension of dose 
escalation  
• Two or more subjects have >[ADDRESS_682665] of either alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspart ate aminotransferase (AST), or >[ADDRESS_682666] of bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) when no other reason can be found to explain the increases 
• One or more subjects experiences a ≥ Grade 2 IRR despi[INVESTIGATOR_526031] . 
Continuation of dosing following suspension will be determined by [CONTACT_526071]. Dosing may also be suspended if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_526022], any new or unexpected significant safety or tolerability issues related to ticagrelor o r PB2452 are identified that warrant further evaluation before additional subjects 
are dosed. This may include emerging nonclinical data, clinically relevant AEs, or relevant data from other sources indicating safety concerns, even if the event(s) per se does not meet the protocol-specified definition of a DLT.

3.5.2 Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Definitions 
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs observed or reported during the study, 
regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. For the purposes of AE recording when relationship to study drug is assessed, study drug refers to PB2452 or placebo. A sep arate line on the eCRF is for assessing whether or not an AE is related to the 
administration of ticagrelor.  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not it is considered drug- related. Sub jects will be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_209786].  
A TEAE is defined as any AE not present before exposure to study drug or any AE already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure to study drug. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility the study 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug (IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than “ adverse reaction,” which means any AE caused by a study drug.  
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions when there are reasons to conclude the drug caused the event.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or 
at the specificity or sev erity that has been observed with the study drug; or, if an IB is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if  the IB listed 
only cerebral vascular accidents. “ Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs 
or suspected adverse reactions mentioned in the IB that occur with a certain class of drugs or as anticipated based on the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically 
mentioned as having occurred with the specific drug under investigation.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered an SAE/suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part B  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 48 •  Death  
•  Life-threatening AE  
•  Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
•  Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
•  Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, may not be life threatening, or may not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical event s 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ life threatening ” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_526035], its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more sever e form, might have caused death.  
Special attention will be given to DLTs and the MTD, if applicable. DLT is defined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. The overall safety profile, in cluding but not limited to DLT s and MTDs will be used 
in the selection of the starting dose(s) in future studies of PB2452 administered by [CONTACT_104482]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and reported to PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. From the time informed consent is signed through to completion of all study procedures and assessments at the Day 28 (±2 days ) visit, 
all AEs will be assessed.  
Subjects may spontaneously report and/or will be asked a standard question to elicit any medically related changes in their well -being. They will also be asked if they have used any 
new medications or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and OTC  medication s).  
In addition to subject observations, AEs will be documented from any data collected on the AE page of the eCRF (e.g., laboratory values, physical examination findings, ECG, Holter monitoring changes) or other documents relevant to subject safety . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of event, time of onset, dosage, 
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-[ADDRESS_682677] also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_11755] (NCS). The current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs.  
Any medical condition present at the time the subject is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if the condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it should be recorded a s an AE.  
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_11770] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
must be reported to the Sponsor immediately (after the investigator has confirmed the occurrence of the SAE). The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility the study drug caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE, as outlined in the US Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Parts [ADDRESS_682678] (IRB) directly.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_526101] ’s daily activities . Severity  will be classified as mild, 
moderate, or severe using the following criteria:  
•  Mild:  These events require minimal to  no treatment and do not interfere with the 
subject ’s daily activities.  
•  Moderate:  These events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with normal functioning.  
•  Severe:  These events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity. An AE characterized as intermittent requires

Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part B  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 50 documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The CTCAE v5 grading scale will be 
used by [CONTACT_526077] s for subsequent study subjects. Additionally, CTCAE v5 will be 
used by [CONTACT_526078] a DLT and/or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_526045].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of the relationship between an AE and study drug or ticagrelor is part of the documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
The investigator will assess causality of all AEs and SAEs (i.e., whether there is a reasonable 
certainty the study drug caused the event). The relationship between an AE and an SAE to 
study drug (and ticagrelor) will be characterized using the following classifications:   
•  Unrelated: This relationship suggests there is no association between study drug (or 
ticagrelor) and the reported event.  
•  Possible:  This relationship is based on evidence suggesting a causal relationship between 
the study drug (or ticagrelor) and the AE (i.e., there is a reasonable possibility the drug caused the event). The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration or the event follows a known response pattern to study drug (or ticagrelor ) but could also have been caused by [CONTACT_1604].  
•  Probable:  This relationship suggests a reasonable temporal sequence of the event with 
drug administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug or class of drugs, or judgment based on the investigator’ s clinical experience, the association of the event with 
study drug (or ticagrelor) seems likely.  
•  Definite:  This relationship suggests that a definite causal relationsh ip exists between 
study drug (or ticagrelor) administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear to explain the event.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page of the eCRF and followed until it 
is resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_526102] . 
3.5.3 Clinical Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by [CONTACT_526079]. B lood will be 
collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1) and will be 
prepared using standard procedures. Repeat cli nical laboratory tests may be performed at the 
discretion of the investigator, if necessary, to evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria or

Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be flagged as either high or low (or normal or 
abnormal) based on the reference ranges for each laboratory parameter. The investigator will determine whether any of the abnormally high or low results are CS  or NCS . Clinical 
significance is defined as any variation in  results that has medical relevance and may result in 
an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, therapeutic measures). If a CS  change from the Screening value is noted,  the CS value and etiology or 
reason for clinical significance will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional assessments until the values have reached either the reference range or the values at Screening or until the investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary . 
When schedule procedures overlap at the same time point (see Schedule of Events  (Appendix 7.1).  there must be planning to collect the specific information within the 
designated time window. Accordingly, the importance of these procedures is: 
1.  Blood collection (whether for PD, PK, immunology, or safety) should always be collected 
at the designated time point (if possible) . However, multiple collections (PD, PK, 
immunology, and safety) may be required at the same time  point. Therefore, the 
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-0002 Part B  Clinical Study Protocol  
25July2019 Page 53 recommend ation is for blood to be drawn in this order: PD, PK, immunology, and safety 
(see lab collection manual from CirQuest for additional information related to collection 
of PD samples).  
2.  The 12-lead ECG Holter monitoring has a ± 10-minute  window (unless otherwise 
 designated in the Schedule of Events, [ Appendix 7.1]) when  this may be done, either 
 before or after blood collection.  
3.  If time permits, vital sign measurements  should be completed just prior to or just after  
 blood collection; this may be still be done within the designated window in the Schedule 
 of Events ( Appendix 7.1).  
3.5.4 Vital Signs Measurements 
Vital signs will be measured at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events  
(Appendix 7.1).   
Vital sign measurements will include SBP, DBP, oral body temperature, RR, and HR. The subject will have rested in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] ≥10 minutes before all measurements are taken. Note:  Vital signs collected during the initial 30 minutes of infusion of study drug 
require only the BP and HR. 
The investigator will determine whether any of the vital sign measurements are CS or NCS . 
Clinical significance is defined as any variation in results that has medical relevanc e and may 
result in an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, 
therapeutic measures). If a CS change from Screening values is noted, the CS  value and 
reason for clinical significance will be documented on the AE page of t he eCRF. The 
investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional assessments until the value has reached either the reference range or the value at S creening or until the investigator 
determines follow -up is no longer medically necessary. 
3.5.[ADDRESS_682680] has rested in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] ≥[ADDRESS_682681] abnormalities. In addition, 
measurements of these intervals will be reported: RR interval, PR interval, QRS width,  
and and QTcF   
The investigator will determine whether any of the 12 -lead ECG results are CS or NCS. 
Clinical significance is defined as any variation in results that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation, diagnos tic measures, 
therapeutic measures). If a CS change from Screening is noted, the CS value and reason for 
PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc             PB2452 
Protocol No. PB2452- PT-CL-[ADDRESS_682682] reached either 
reference range or the values at Screening or until the investigator determines follow -up is no 
longer medically necessary.  
3.5.6 Holter Monitoring ( Continuous Twelve -lead ECG ) 
Holter monitoring (continuous 12-lead ECG recording) for 24 hours will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1) to monitor HR and rhythm 
activity as standard safety measurements. The clinical research site will be responsible for providing trained study personnel for setting up and managing the Holter monitoring system to ensure that reports of Holter findings for each subject will be available for review at the safety review meeting for each cohort. The continuous ECG waveform data recorded by [CONTACT_526080]- response QTc analysis. The Holter 
monitoring system used will be maintained in accordance with the clinical research site SOPs.  
The SRC will determine if any of the Holter findings are CS at the safety review meetings. Clinical significance  is defined as any variation in results that has medical relevance and may 
result  in an alteration in medical care (e.g., active observation , diagnostic measures, 
therapeutic measures).  
If a CS finding from the Holter report is noted, the CS findings and etiology or reason for clinical significance will be documented in the AE page of the eCRF. The SRC may recommend repeat Holter monitoring during the 28- day safety period if clinically indicated.  
3.5.7 Physical Examinations  
A physical examination will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1).   
A full physical examination will include assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities.  
A brief physical examination will include assessment of  skin (including any signs of 
cutaneous erythema), lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver, spleen). Interim physical examinations will be performed at the discretion of the investigator,  if necessary, to 
evaluate AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities. Height and weight will be measured , and 
BMI  will be calculated at Screening and at Day 28 (±2 days).

25July2019 Page 55 3.5.8 Infusion Site Asses sments  
The infusion site will be examined by [CONTACT_526081]ée concerning pain, 
tenderness, erythema/redness, and induration/swelling, as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Appendix 7.1).  Infusion site reactions will be assessed according to the CTCAE v5 grading 
scale and will be recorded as AEs; these should be followed until resolution. 
3.5.9 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Immunogenicity (antibody) s amples will be screened for the presence of binding anti -drug 
antibodies (ADA) at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix 7.1).  
Results of immunogenicity samples taken prior to administering study drug do not need to be available prior to dosing nor to confirm subject eligibility. A subject who tests positive for ADAs at the final scheduled visit (Day 28 ±2 days) will be asked to return for follow-up sampling approximately [ADDRESS_682683] positive or until levels return to a predose state. 
3.6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
3.6.1 Sample Size Calculations  
The sample size (N) of up to 3 cohorts of up to 12 subjects for Part B of this study is based on clinical and practical considerations rather than  on formal statistical power calculation. 
The sample size will provide preliminary safety, efficacy and PK inf ormation in a 
dose/regimen finding fashion.  
3.6.[ADDRESS_682684] ≥1 measurable

by [CONTACT_2715]. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_526082] (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation ( SD), CV , median, 
minimum, and maximum). Geometric means will be reported for AUCs and C
max.  
The PK parameters of PB2452, ticagrelor, and TAM will be determined with noncompartmental methods using Phoenix
® WinNonlin® (Certara, L.P., Princeton, NJ) 
Version 6.4 or higher or SAS® Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Actual 
sampling times, r ather than scheduled sampling times, will be used in all calculations of PK 
parameters. However, for ease of presentation, scheduled sampling times will be used to present results in tables, listings, and figures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Pharmacodynamic data will be summarized for each time point using descriptive statistics 
(number of subjects, mean, SD, CV , median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment group or by [CONTACT_491684] . Pharmacodynamic parameters will also be 
summarized .  Inferen tial analysis maybe carried out to compare the % inhibition of PRU, 
LTA, PRI between PB2452 vs Placebo individually. However due to the limited sample size, efficacy analysis results will be considered descriptive.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_183108] -organ -class  (SOC) using the 
latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All AE data

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any ONE  of the following 3 criteria is  fulfilled:  
1.  Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue- uvula) AND 
AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
 a.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced  
  peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [ PEF], hypoxemia)  
 b.  Reduced blood pressure ( BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g.,  
  hypotonia [ collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2.  Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that 
patient (minutes to several hours):  
   a.  Involvement of the skin- mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen  
   lips-tongue- uvula)  
  b.  Resp iratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced  
   PEF, hypoxemia)  
  c.  Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse],  
   syncope, incontinence)  
  d.  Persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3.  Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):  
  a.  Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (S BP; age specific) or >30% decrease 
   in S BP*  
  b.  Adults: S BP <90 mm Hg or > 30% decrease from that person’s B aseline 
*   Low SBP for children from 1 month to 1 year is defined as <70 mm Hg (<70  mmHg + [2 x age]) ; 
 <70  mmHg + [2 x age ] from 1 to 10 years ; and <90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

Background  
It is estimated that 1 in 6 people worldwide will experience a stroke, with about 30%  of those 
individual s experiencing aphasia, which is a loss in their ability to understand or express language [1], [2] . 
Aphasia  is associated with increased mortality  [3], decreased rates of functional recovery  [4], [5] , loss of 
productivity, and social isolation [6]–[10]. Broca's aphasia is one of the most common types of apha sia 
and results in slow, effortful, pauses and disturbed rhythm of language  [11], [12] . While intensive therapy 
can reduce language impairment [13], it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_542641] k of 
coverage, transportation, or limited access to a trained rehabilitation specialist [14]–[17]. Thus, individuals 
with aphasia often fail to recover to their full potential [18]–[21]. Additionally, individuals  with Broca’s 
aphasia often have extremely limited recovery with traditional speech therapy methods  due to large 
lesions in the left -hemispher ic language regions  of the brain  [22]. For these individuals, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_542642] -hemispheric regions have the potential to improve  the language 
recovery process  [22]–[24]. Rhythm -based treatments are particularly well -suited to engage these specific 
right -hemisph eric regions [25], [26] , leading to promising improvements in language recovery [27]–[29]. 
However, to maximize potential language recovery with rhythm -based treatments, the therapy dosage 
needs to be much highe r than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_11427] [30]. Home therapy options  could increase the dosage 
of therapy individuals receive, but available options are not motivating, lack performance feedback , and 
have failed to gain widespread adoption.  
 Recognizing this, we developed an easy -to-use, rhythm -based, home therapy app for individuals 
with non -fluent aphasia.  The app instructs users to tap  their left hand  and speak aloud with each syllable 
of a phrase as it scrolls from left to right across th e screen. The rhythmicity of the target phrase is cued 
using a background metronome and the visual spacing of each syllable. The app uses the built -in tablet 
microphone to detect if the user spoke the target syllable with the correct timing. The app guides users 
though a set of pre -programmed phrases with fading cues, requiring them to first tap the target rhythm, 
then tap and speak the phrase simultaneously, and finally to speak t he phrase without tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
Study Desi gn 
We evaluated the usability of the app in  a four -week  at-home study with 10 individuals with aphasia 
in the chronic stage of stroke . All participants were provided a ta blet with the therapy app installed and 
were in structed to perform a 30-minute language therapy session 5 days  a week  over the 4 -week period.  
 
Methods  
Inclusion criteria included a diagnosis of aphasia due to stroke, >[ADDRESS_708136]  stroke, and sufficient 
motor function of the unaffected upper extremity to tap on a table while speaking. Exclusion criteria 
included incidence of other neurological diseases (though individuals with apraxia were allowed to 
participate) and age <85, as ol der age may be a confounding variable when assessing the feasibility of a 
new technology. While we believe it is likely that people with other types of aphasia can benefit from the 
therapy app, we wanted to keep the inclusion criteria narrow for this initi al feasibility study, and the 
language abilities (e.g., relatively intact comprehension of simple spoken and written language)  and needs 
(e.g., impaired repetition and naming) of people with non -fluent aphasia are well -suited to the therapy 
app’s design.  
All participants provided informed consent, with appropriate measures taken to reduce the 
challenges associated with obtaining consent from people with aphasia who may have both 
communication and cognitive impairments. Specifically, the consent form was wr itten in plain language, 
and the researcher obtaining consent 1) read the consent form aloud to the participant while being 
cautious to maintain a slowed rate and pause frequently, 2) allowed the participant to read the consent 
form, and 3) used any augmen tative/alternative communication format the participant uses when 
communicating [31]. Further, the app was demonstrated briefly during the consent process to support 
understanding of what the participant is being asked to do. In  situations where a participant did not have 
capacity to consent, the participant was asked to provide assent and consent was obtained from their 
legally authorized representative. Participants were then evaluated using the WAB assessment and a short 
form of the [LOCATION_011] Naming Test (BNT) [32] to establish baseline levels of language impairment. Next, they 
were invited to use the therapy app under supervision from a study administrator who  provided initial 
instruction on how the sy stem worked and then guided the users through a practice session . Participants 
played through the game for a few phrases until they had demonstrated that they could play the game 
on their own.  
After the practice session, participants took home a tablet wit h the app pre -installed and were 
instructed to complete at least one 30 -minute language therapy session 5 days a week (equating to a 
target dose of 2.5 hours of therapy per week, or 10 hours over 4 weeks) . Each therapy session c onsisted 
of practicing a sin gle phrase 8 times in a row with progressing difficulty (i.e. 8 attempts “just tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” , 
then 8 attempts “ tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] + speaking” , then 8 attempts “ speaking without tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” ) before moving to a 
new phrase, with a goal of practicing 12 different phrases each da y. The same set of 12 phrases was 
practiced for 1 week, and at the end of each week, participants were provided a set of 12 new phrases. 
More difficult phrases with two and three syllable words were gradually introduced over the 4 -week 
period. After comple ting all 12 phrases in a given day, participants were free to practice any previous 
phrases. Participants returned for follow -up evaluation after 4 weeks.  
 
Results and Statistical Analysis  
Ten individuals with aphasia in the chronic stage of stroke were recruited. Data from two individuals 
was not considered in analysis as one was deemed ineligible due to global aphasia diagnosis and the other 
withdrew from the study shortly after baseline asse ssment.  Our primary outcome measure for this study 
was patient adherence  (measured as hours of app use during the study period ), which was extracted 
directly from the tablet at the follow -up assessment. Over the [ADDRESS_708137] eted the target dose of home therapy (at least 10 total hours)  with three individuals completing 
over 20 hours of therapy. No safety concerns or adverse events were reported.  No additional statistical 
analyses were performed due to the small sample size of the study

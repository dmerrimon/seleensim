settings and to evaluate Exparel in a similar setting  
Numerous text changes to accommodate the addition 
of the two cohorts  and to provide Exparel instructions  To pro vide clarity in protocol instructions with the 
addition of two cohorts , remove redundant text and 
improve clarity of language  
 
 
Changes from Protocol version 2.0 to 3.0  Rationale  
Addition of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_149145] (MTF) 
dated [ADDRESS_171633] to continue use of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
Modificat ion of Mayo block instructions prior to start 
of cohort 2 per MTF 26 March:  
• Previous instructions: A Mayo block using 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.25% 30 mL prior to surgery 
and lidocaine HCl 1.5% 12 mL at the end of 
surgery  
• New instructions: A Mayo block prior to 
surgery 30 mL of a mixture of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149146] 0.5% 15 mL combined with lidocaine HCl 
2% 15 mL resulting in bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.25% (75 
mg) and lidocaine 1% (300 mg).  To provide adequate  time for the Mayo block to set up 
and avoid a second infiltration post -surger y, lidocaine 
was added to the block at the outset and not used 
later on after  CA-008 dosing.  
Use of monitored anesthesia care  (as defined by [CONTACT_41536]) 
rather than the term “ sedation ”. To avoid confusion over anesthesia conduct . 
Minor changes were made to remo ve confusing 
language or make text more readable.  Reduce confusion or the potential for 
misinterpretation

Study Title:  An Open -Label Study of Intraoperative CA -[ADDRESS_171636] : CA-008  
Planned Study 
Center(s):  1 US site  
Indication:  Acute postsurgical pain  
Sample Size:  N = 36 (9 per treatment cohort )  
Population:  Adults ages 18 to 65 years, inclusive, who are planning to undergo an elective unilateral 
Bunionectomy (BUNX) and otherwis e meet eligibility criteria may be considered for 
enrollment into the study.  
Study Duration:  Up to 76 days: Screening period from 45 days prior to surgery (D -45) to D29±[ADDRESS_171637] -
anesthesia care unit (PACU).  
Study Design:  
 This is a Phase 2, sin gle-center, open -label study of [ADDRESS_171638] metatarsal osteotomy for the correction of hallux valgus deformity 
(bunionectomy or BUNX ) under monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and Mayo field block 
with or without a supplemental popliteal block with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] (HCl)  and 
lidocaine HCl .   
Additionally, a 4th cohort of 9 subjects will receive Exparel® (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149147] ; Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ) under monitored anesthesia care 
(MAC) and Mayo field block with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149148].  
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-205               Confidential  
Version: 02 May 2019        Page 6 of 73 The study will be conducted in two parts:  
• Inpatient period which continues to T72 hNRS  
• Outpatient period which begins on discharge from the inpatient unit through 
follow up visits to D29±2 after surgery  (cohorts 1 -3) or to D8 ±1 (cohort 4)  
Study 
Objectives:  Primary Objective : 
To evaluate different standard of care anesthetic regimens on CA -[ADDRESS_171639] of care anesthetic 
regimens in subjects undergoing an elective BUNX . 
Exploratory  Objective  
To evaluate Exparel ’s performance in subjects undergoing an elective BUNX  under a 
standard of care anesthetic regimen.  
CA-008 Dosing 
Schedule and 
Administration  
(Cohort s 1-3): CA-008 (4.2 mg in 14 mL) will be injected/instilled intraoperatively into the soft tissues 
and osteotomy surgical site as follows:  
• Instill 2 mL at cut bone sites  
• Prior to capsule closure, i nfiltrate the deep soft tissue and area proximal to the 
capsule with a total of 9 mL (approximately 2.25 mL into each quadrant 
circumferentially)  
• Close the capsule, but using a small gauge catheter (or needle) infiltrate 2 mL into 
the clo sed capsule space    
• Prior to closure of the subcutaneous tissues and skin, instill 1 mL to coat all 
exposed surfaces  
Exparel Dosing 
(Cohort 4)  Exparel  106 mg (8  mL of the 133 mg/10 mL suspension ) will be infiltrated 
intraoperatively into the soft tissues and osteotomy surgical site prior to closure as 
follows:  
• Infiltrate  7 mL into the tissues surrounding the osteotomy   
• Infiltrate  1 mL into the subcutaneous tissues  
See Exparel full prescribing information  for detailed administration instructions :  
https://www.exparel.com/hcp/prescriptioninformation.pdf  (as revised 11/2018; Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.).  
Anesthesia  and 
Intraoperative 
Analgesia : The surgery is to be performed under MAC anesthesia (Appendix 17.H ) supplemented 
with one of two different standard of care regimens to produce surgical anesthesia.  In 
both regimens, intraoperative analgesia will include IV ketorolac [ADDRESS_171640] is free to administer additiona l IV fentanyl doses per anesthesia 
discretion.  
The systemic anesthesia medication doses detailed in the current protocol (including but 
not limited to fentanyl, ketorolac and acetaminophen) are suggested guidelines to be

metatarsals).  
In the 1st cohort of 9 subjects, prior to surgical incision (except as noted), perform the 
following local anesthetic nerve blocks:  
• A popliteal block performed under ultrasound guidance using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 
0.25% 30 mL (75 mg)  
• A Mayo block u sing bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.25% 30 mL (75 mg) also prior to surgery 
and lidocaine HCl 1.5% 12 mL at the end of surgery  
In the 2nd cohort  of 9 subjects perform the following:  
• A Mayo block alone using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% 1 5 mL combined with 
lidocaine HCl 2% [ADDRESS_171642] and 4th cohort s of 9 subjects in each perform the following:  
• A Mayo block alone using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% 1 0 mL combined with 
lidocaine HCl 2% 20 mL prior to surgery   
• CA-[ADDRESS_171643] be injected no sooner than 20 minu tes after the Mayo 
block  
• Total bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149149] 176.8 mg: 121.8 mg from Exparel and 55 
mg from bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149150]:  Subjects will be monitored after surgery (through T72 hNRS hour) at the trial site as an 
inpatient .  Safety and  efficacy evaluations will be performed.  Subjects will be required to 
meet standard pre -specified criteria for discharge from the unit.  Subjects will continue to 
be monitored as an outpatient after discharge for safety and efficacy assessments.  
Inpatien t 
Multimodal 
Analgesia:  After recovery from surgery, subjects in cohorts 1 and 2 will be given:  
• celecoxib (Celebrex®) 200 mg PO bid each day while an inpatient, and  
• acetaminophen 1 g PO (2 doses on the day of surgery starting at 6±2h after 
surgery and ag ain at 12±2h after surgery) and t.i.d. each day thereafter while an 
inpatient  
After recovery from surgery, subjects in cohorts [ADDRESS_171644] use as needed.  
Rescue 
Medication 
during the 
Inpatient The following rescue medication is available to subjects and may be administered for any 
moderate to severe breakthrough pain at any time  during the inpatient period:  
• During the PACU stay (90 minutes , if possible , to ensure that pain is well 
controlled), administer IV fentanyl 25 -50 mcg q5-10 min  prn moderate (≥ 4) or 
severe pain (≥ 7) as reported by [CONTACT_149186] 0 to 10 numerical rating scale

Version: 02 May  2019        Page 8 of 73 Period:  of current pain intensity (NRS)  
• After PACU discharge  to T24h , administer PO oxycodone 5 mg for moderate or 
10 mg for severe pain prn q2h 
• After 24h, admini ster PO oxycodone [ADDRESS_171645] or administration should be based on 
T0hNRS (defined as the time of PACU admission).  
Analgesia 
during 
Outpatient 
Period:  
 Once discharged from the inpatient unit, all study participants will be instru cted to take a 
combination of OTC analgesics (NSAID and acetaminophen) at an appropriate dose per 
Investigator medical judgment to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain 
(note that these medications will not be provided by [CONTACT_456]):  
• NSAI D (e.g., ibuprofen 400 - 600 mg prn up to qid [Advil® or Motrin®] or 
naproxen 220 mg prn up to tid [Aleve®]) or other options per Investigator 
discretion and  
• Acetaminophen 1 -2 tablets (325 mg or 500 mg ) prn but no more than 1g for a 
single dose and doses m ay not be taken more frequently than q4h with a daily 
maximum acetaminophen dose of 3g.  
If a subject is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_149151] 6h prior to discharge from the inpatient 
unit, then at discharge prescribe no more than 9 tablets (1 PO tid prn) of  oxycodone [ADDRESS_171646] the need 
for an unscheduled in -person visit to assess the surgical site.  If such a situation occurs, 
the Investigator should use clinical discretion on adequacy of analgesic  treatment, but to 
capture this event as an adverse event (AE) and document any required treatments.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  Enrollment in the study will be paused for evaluation of specific TEAEs after CA -008 
dosing (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_149152] 4):  
• If one or more subjects experience any grade 4 (or higher) related TEAE (see 
table below) or  
• If 2 or more subjects experience the same grade 3 related TEAE (see table below)

Visit Schedule:  
 1. Screening D -45 to D -1: Subjects undergo screening during this period. All screening 
assessments (including informed consent form [ICF]) must be completed at least 1 
day prior to surgery.  If screening occurs prior to D -30, it may be necessary to 
reverify eligibility and ICF agreement, but only if the facility SOP requires su ch 
reverification be performed.  
2. Site Unit Admission D0 : Day of surgery , perform baseline evaluations prior to 
surgery.  
3. Surgery D0 : BUNX procedure is performed under MAC  anesthesia with the 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-205               Confidential  
Version: [ADDRESS_171652]-surgery  to T72 hNRS: Subject remains at the Site Unit for study assessments.  At 
discharge provide follow up instructions, particularly on diary completion.  
5. Follow Up D8±1 : clinic visit for study assessments  (cohorts 1 -3) and study 
completion visit (cohort 4).  
6. Follow Up D15±2:  clinic visit for study assessments  (cohorts 1 -3 only)  
7. Follow Up D29±2:  clinic visit for study assessments and study completion visit 
(cohorts 1 -3 only)  unless a pending safety event is ongoing and requires follow up  
8. Early Termination (ET):  For subjects who terminate early, an ET visit will be 
required. Safety and subject -reported outcome assessments will be performed.  
9. Unscheduled visits:  may occur at any time to assess any safety event  
Safety 
Parameters:  • Incidence of spontaneous reported TEAE s or SAEs : 
o TEAEs are defined as AEs occurring after start of  CA-008 or Exparel dosing  
o AEs/SAEs  recorded from the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed 
up to D0/T0 will be recorded in medical history.   The Investigator must 
determine whether any su ch AE/SAE merits a delay in study participation.  
• Surgical site assessments and neurosensory testing near the incision as an outpatient 
on D8, D15 and D29  (CA-008) or D8 only (Exparel) .   
o If there are skin reactions atypi[INVESTIGATOR_84699], e.g., m ore than 
expected erythema, drainage, bruising or hematoma, induration, swelling or 
other skin changes, they should be documented as AEs, graded for severity 
and followed regularly until resolution or establishment of a new baseline.  If 
the local reaction s are typi[INVESTIGATOR_149156], it should not be 
captured as an AE.  
o Numbness at or near the incision need not be considered a neurologic AE 
since this could occur because of tissue trauma and inflammation from the 
surgery.  
o Sensory deficits or clinic ally significant persistent sensory change beyond the 
area proximal to the incision at time of discharge, such as allodynia or 
hyperalgesia atypi[INVESTIGATOR_149156], must be designated as a 
neurologic AE. Subjects will be followed until there is fu ll return to baseline 
for the neurosensory assessment or until there is a determination that it has 
reached a resolution or establishment of a new baseline.  
• D15 and D29 visits: assess for presence of rebound pain at the surgical site  (cohorts 
1-3 only)  
• Physical examination (PE): complete at screening; interim assessments on D -1 (or D0 
prior to surgery if not done on D -1) and during each outpatient visit (D8, D15 and 
D29)  for cohorts 1 -3 only ; for cohort 4 , at screening , interim assessments on D -1 (or 
D0 prior to surgery if not done on D -1) and D8.  
• Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR]) and 
temperature at screening, entrance and discharge from the PACU, and during the 
inpatient period (per site SOP but generally once per shift or every 8h) and during 
Clinical Trial Protocol  CA-PS-205               Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 13 of 73 each outpatient visit (D8, D15 and D29)  for cohorts 1 -3 only ; and for cohort 4, 
through D8 only .    
• X-rays should be obtained during screening, if not already performed in the 6 months 
prior to screening, and at the D29 visit  (cohorts 1 -3 only) . 
• Screening clinical laboratory tests  
o CBC  
o Blood Chemistry: sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, creatinine and 
glucose  
o Serum and urine pregnancy test for FCBP: βhCG test at screening and urine 
test usually to be done within 24 hours prior to surgery.  
• Drug screen  
Efficacy 
Parameters:  1. NRS scores will be assessed as follows:  
• At T0h (entry to PACU), T 1hNRS, 2hNRS, 3hNRS, 4hNRS, 6hNRS, 8hNRS and 12 hNRS 
and every 6h thereafter while an inpatient.  
• Pain scores may be skipped between the hours of midnight and [ADDRESS_171653] may not miss two consecutive assessments due to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
• The T24 hNRS and T48 hNRS hour assessment s must be completed even if the 
subject is asleep at these times.    
• An additional NRS assessment must be obtained within [ADDRESS_171654]  but prior to administration of rescue .  Note that failure 
to obtain this assessment wil l be considered a major protocol deviation.  
• Starting in the evening of the 1st postoperative day through the D8 visit, NRS 
assessments twice daily at approximately 0800h (±2h) and each evening prior to 
bedtime at approximately 2000h (±2h) at rest and with ambulation of 
approximately [ADDRESS_171655] be 
documented in the diary.  
2. Daily and total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (OC) in oral morphine dose equivalents (MEDs) 
will be recorded during the inpatient and outpatient periods.  
Safety 
Endpoints:  The following safety endpoints will be evaluated:  
• Incidence of TEAEs or treatment -emergent SAEs  
• Clinically significant changes in s urgical site assessments and neurosensory testing  
• X-ray healing (CA-008 only)  
• Absence of rebound  pain at the surgical site  (CA-008 only)  
Efficacy 
Endpoint s: Using NRS scores (at rest and with ambulation), pain intensity over the 72h inpatient stay 
will be assessed.  NRS scores at various time points: T24 hNRS, T48 hNRS and T72 hNRS.

5.1. Background   
Concentric Analgesics, Inc. (Concentric) is developin g CA -[ADDRESS_171674] -surgical pain following a single local administration  (for 96h and beyond) .  CA -008 
is a prodrug of trans -capsaicin (trans -8-methyl -N-vanillyl -6-nonenamide) , the substance in chili 
peppers that produces the sensation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_84713].  Capsaicin is a transient receptor potential 
cation channel, subfamily V (vanilloid), member 1 (TRPV1) agonist.  TRPV1 is a ligand -gated, 
nonselective, cation channel preferentially expressed most densely in C -fiber nociceptors and to 
a lesser extent on Aδ –fiber nociceptors (Babbar 2009, Caterina 2001 ). TRPV1 responds to 
noxious stimuli including capsaicin, heat, and extracellular acidification, and integrates 
simultaneous exposures to these stimuli (Suresh 2010, Surh 1995, Tomin aga 1998 ).   
Capsaicin exposure  to TRPV -1-expressing nociceptor peripheral terminals  results in initial 
excitation of the nociceptor followed by a functional desensitization which continues for some 
time after removal of capsaicin from the site.  Capsaicin , however, is virtually insoluble in 
aqueous media  or local anesthetic solutions which means that capsaicin formulations tend to be 
quite hydrophobic and viscous making them hard to inject and less likely to permeate surgical 
site tissues.  To work around the solubility limitations of capsaicin, t he highly water -soluble 
capsaicin pro -drug CA -[ADDRESS_171675] or had clinical development programs for such products.  
Centrexion Therapeutics has an active development p rogram (CTNX -4975) for intraarticular 
injection of capsaicin  in a polyethylene glycol solution  for chronic knee osteoarthritis  (currently 
in Phase 3) and Morton’s neuroma (see http://centrexion.com/our -pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]/ ).

through a 25 g needle or larger.  It readily penetrates surgical site tissues where it releases 
capsaicin through a non -enzymatic pH -driven process.  Local administration of CA -008 at or 
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: [ADDRESS_171677].  The free base form of CA-008 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149160] a cyclic urea,  as shown in the 
scheme below:  
 
CA-008 was specifically selected for development due to its short half -life (<5 min) at neutral 
pH.  In Tris buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C, it completely breaks apart to capsaicin and CA -101 as the 
sole degradants.  
The cyclic urea (CA-101) formed has not been previously evaluated for biological activity.  
While not a known compound in the clinical literature, its safety was evaluated in all nonclinical 
studies with CA -008 and it was shown to be inactive.  The toxicokinetic profiles for CA -008, 
CA-101, and capsaicin were determined in GLP safety studies  and the PK profile for various 
doses were determined in a Phase 1 ascending dose safety study and a Phase 2 parallel design 
study in patients undergoing bunionectomy . 
5.3. Previous Human experience  
There is substantial clinical support for the potential safety of capsaicin, the active molecule 
released by [CONTACT_28474] -008 in vivo.  In addition to consumption in hot spi[INVESTIGATOR_84716] (chili peppers) , 
capsaicin is an approved product for dermal applications for OTC and prescription use (Qutenza; 
8% patch for management of neuropathic pain associated with post herpetic neuralgia) , is 
frequently used intradermally in experimental pain models,  and has be en studied clinically for 
wound instillation for postsurgical analgesia (Anesiva; Adlea; capsaicin for instillation).    
Additionally, a  first-in-human study (Study CA -PS-2017 -101) evaluated  the safety and 
tolerability of CA -008 (dose ranges 0.5 mg to 4.2 m g) in 40 subjects (6 at each CA -008 dose for 
a total of 30 and 10 receiving placebo) undergoing a unilateral transpositional first metatarsal 
osteotomy for correction of hallux valgus deformity, more commonly known as a  bunionectomy.  
A follow -on Phase 2 b unionectomy study (CA -PS-201) was completed with 147 subjects 
enrolled and randomized to one of 3 active doses: 0.7 mg  (N=36) , 2.1 mg  (N=36 ) and 4.2 mg  
(N=38 ) vs. placebo  (N=37) .  The highest dose of 4.2 mg was well tolerated and was statistically 
signific antly superior to placebo for the primary efficacy endpoint of AUC 0 -96h (p=0.005) and 
key secondary efficacy endpoints: AUC 0 to week 1 (p=0.036); mean opi[INVESTIGATOR_149161] -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 24 of 73 (reduced by 50%, p<0.002); and percent of subjects who were opi[INVESTIGATOR_149162] 0 to 96 h (26% vs. 
5% for placebo; p=0.039).  There was a single SAE (delayed cellulitis) in the placebo group.  
5.4. Study and Dose Rationale  
5.4.1.   Study Rationale  
CA-008 is being investigated as a potential therapy for treatment of pain following surgery.   
5.4.2.  Selection of Do ses 
The safety of CA -008 was established in relevant animal models and supported by [CONTACT_149188] (CA-PS-2017 -101 and CA -PS-201) as well as  the first dosing cohorts (CA -
008 5 mg dose) in complete abdominoplasty and total knee arthroplasty .  These studies  are 
considered sufficient to support the intended use of CA -008 in th is study.  
5.4.3.  Selection and Timing of Dose  
CA-008 is a pH labile prodrug of capsaicin that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_149163].   Decision for single a dministration at the time of surgery is based on capsaicin’s 
mechanism of action.  Capsaicin exposure results in initial excitation followed by a functional 
desensitization of TRPV -1-expressing nociceptors which continues for some time after removal 
of cap saicin from the site.   Administration while the patient is under anesthesia for the 
procedure supplemented by a regional local anesthetic block or local anesthetic infiltration 
addresses the pain that results from TRPV1 agonism.  Administration of CA -008 during the  
closure process is ideal for delivering therapy to the surgical site, thus optimizing target 
engagement.  During closure, the surgical tissue is exposed and visible which allows for  
complete and adequate delivery of CA-008 to the potential areas  where noxious pain is being 
generated.

7.3.2.  Planned Anesthesia and Regional Blocks  
The surgery is to be performed under MAC  supplemented with one of two different standard of 
care regimens to produce surgical anesthesia: popliteal + Mayo block OR Mayo block alone .  For 
the Mayo block, the su rgeon should inject just distal to the base of the 1st metatarsal to provide 
coverage of each quadrant paying particular attention to the space between the 1st and 2nd 
metatarsals).   In each cohort, i ntraoperative analgesia will include IV ketorolac 30 mg and IV 
acetaminophen 1 g at the onset of anesthesia .   
The systemic anesthesia medication doses (including but not limited to fentanyl, ketorolac and 
acetaminophen) are suggested guidelines to be followed by [CONTACT_149189]. The  actual doses given are at the discretion of the anesthesiologist based on the clinical 
status of the subject.  With respect to non -analgesic medications, the anesthesiologist is free to 
use clinical discretion on the choice and dose.  
In the 1st cohort of 9 subjects, prior to surgical incision (except as noted), perform the following 
local anesthetic blocks:  
• A popliteal block performed under ultrasound guidance using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.25% 
(30 mL volume) with an assessment of the adequacy of the block  
• A Mayo  block using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0. 25% 30 mL ( 75 mg) prior to surgery and 
lidocaine HCl 1.5% 12 mL at the end of surgery .   
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: [ADDRESS_171681] s, prior to surgical incision, perform the following : 
• A Mayo block using a combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% 15 mL and lidocaine HCl 
2% [ADDRESS_171682] and 4th cohort s of 9 subjects  in each , prior to surgical incision, perform the following : 
• A Mayo block using a combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% 10 mL and lidocaine HCl 
2% 20 mL prior to surgery .   
• Note that CA -008 or Exparel administration should be no sooner than 20 minutes after 
the Mayo block.  
• In cohort 4, t otal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149164] 176.8 mg: 121.8 mg from Exparel and 
55 mg from bupi[INVESTIGATOR_149165], patients will be monitored in the PACU to ensure recovery from the  
anesthesia.  Note that T0 hNRS is the time of entry to the PACU .  Subjects will be monitored for 72 
hours  in an inpatient unit during which time s afety and efficacy evaluations will be performed.  
Subjects will be required to meet certain pre -specified criteria prior to discharge.  
7.3.3.  Administration of CA-008 
Prior to wound c losure, CA-008 will be injected/instilled into the soft tissues and osteotomy 
surgical site with a t otal volume of 14 mL of CA -008 as follows:  
• Instill 2 mL at cut bone sites  
• Prior to capsule closure, i nfiltrate the deep soft tissue and area proximal to th e capsule with 
a total of 9 mL (approximately 2.25 mL into each quadrant circumferentially)  
• Close the capsule, but using a small gauge catheter infiltrate 2 mL into the closed capsule 
space  
• Prior to closure of the subcutaneous tissues and skin, instill 1 m L to coat all exposed 
surfaces of the wound  
7.3.4.  Administration of Exparel  
Exparel 106 mg (8 mL of the 133 mg/10 mL suspension) will be infiltrated intraoperatively into 
the soft tissues and osteotomy surgical site prior to closure as follows:  
• Infiltrate 7 mL into the tissues surrounding the osteotomy  
• Infiltrate 1 mL into the subcutaneous tissues  
Note that Exparel administration should not begin until 20 minutes after the Mayo block.  See

For cohorts 1 and 2, a fter recovery from surgery, subjects will be given:  
• celecoxib (Celebrex®) 200 mg PO  bid each day while an inpatient, and  
• acetaminophen 1 g PO (2 dos es on the day of surgery starting at 6±2h after surgery and 
again at 12±2h after surgery) and t.i.d. thereafter each day while an inpatient  
For cohorts 3 and 4, other than the non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_149166], no additional non -
opi[INVESTIGATOR_149167] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_149168].  
No other non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_149169] . 
7.5. Postoperative Rescue Medication  
Additionally, the following rescue medication may be administered for any moderate to severe 
breakthrough pain during the inpatient period:  
• During the PACU stay (90 minutes, if possible, to ensu re that pain is well controlled), 
administer IV fentanyl 25 -50 mcg q5 -10 min prn moderate (≥ 4) or severe pain (≥ 7) as 
reported by [CONTACT_149186] 0 to 10 numerical rating scale of current pain intensity 
(NRS)  
• From time of PACU discharge to  T24hNRS hours, PO oxycodone 5 mg for moderate or 10 
mg for severe pain prn q2h  
• After T24 hNRS hour to discharge from the inpatient unit, PO oxycodone 5 mg for 
moderate or 10 mg for severe pain prn q4h  
Subjects will be encouraged to rescue only for moderate pain scores  (≥ 4), however rescue may 
be requested at any time and medication will be provided when requested per protocol timing.  
7.6. Postoperative Care  While an Inpatient  
After surgery, subjects will be monitored as an inpatient until discharged .  Safety and efficacy 
evaluations will be performed.  Subjects will be required to meet standard pre -specified criteria 
for discharge from the unit.   
The schedule of assessments are as follows:  
• Perform NRS assessments of current pain intensity  (Appendix 17.B ):  
o During the inpatient stay, at T 0hNRS (entrance to PACU) , 1hNRS, 2hNRS, 3hNRS, 4hNRS, 
6hNRS, 8hNRS and 12hNRS and every 6 hours (if awake at time of assessment) until 
discharge from the inpatient unit (may not miss two consecut ive assessments.    
o Pain sco res may be skipped between the hours of midnight and [ADDRESS_171683] 
may not miss two consecutive assessments due to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

twice daily at approximately 0800h (±2h) and each e vening prior to bedtime at 
approximately 2000h (±2h) at rest and with ambulation of approximately [ADDRESS_171685] be documented in the diary.  
o There will be a ±[ADDRESS_171686] 4 hours after the end of surgery after which will be a ±15 minute window allowed  
while an inpatient . 
• Vital signs: (HR, BP, RR and temperature) at screening, entrance and discharge from the 
PACU, and during the inpatient period (per  site SOP but generally at least once per shift or 
every 8h) .   There will be a ±[ADDRESS_171687] 4 hours after the end of surgery, after which will be a ±15 -minute window allowed.  
• Perform i nterim PE: surgical site assessment (Appendix 17.D  and Appendix 17.E) and 
neurosensory testing ( Appendix 17.F) of the foot proximal to the surgical site with 
contralateral compariso n: prior to discharge from the inpatient unit.  
• Document c oncomitant medication use including doses and times taken  
• Document AEs 
After completing the assessments through T 72NRS hours after surgery and prior to discharge from 
the inpatient unit, review wit h the subject the use of a diary for at -home use to record pain 
assessments and medication use (including pain medication) at home.  Finally, instruct s ubjects 
to return to the study center on D8 ±1 for a follow -up assessment.   
Once discharged from the inpa tient unit, all study participants will be instructed to take a 
combination of OTC analgesics (NSAID and acetaminophen) at an appropriate dose per medical 
judgment to manage any residual or breakthrough postsurgical pain through D29/W4.  
Outpatient period:   
• If needed for pain management, over -the-counter (OTC) analgesics administered PO, 
e.g.,  
o NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen 200 mg to 400 mg prn qid [Advil® or Motrin®] or 
naproxen 220 mg prn tid [Aleve®]) or other options per investigator discretion 
and  
o Acetaminop hen 1 -2 500 mg tablets (up to 1 g) tid or 650 mg qid (3g daily limit)  
• If a subject is still requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_149151] 6h prior to discharge from the inpatient 
unit then at discharge prescribe no more than 9 tablets (1 PO tid prn) of oxycodone 5 mg 
for the initial outpatient period.   Document this prescription and number of tablets

7.7. Outpatient Phase : D8±[ADDRESS_171688] and after ambulation each 
morning (08:00 ±2  hours), a nd each evening (20:00 ±2  hours) using the NRS .  The morning NRS 
assessment should be obtained prior to taking any pa in medication.  Subjects will also record any 
medication they take  (dose and time) whether  to treat their pain  or for any other reasons . 
Persistent pain or pain exacerbations during this period may suggest the need for an unscheduled 
in-person visit to ass ess the surgical site.  If such a situation occurs, the Investigator should use 
clinical discretion on adequacy of analgesic treatment, but to capture this event as an adverse 
event (AE) and document any required treatments.  
For cohort 4, the D8 visit is t he study completion visit.  
Subjects will return to the study center on D8 ±1 for the following assessments:  
• Subject home diary review , then collect subject home diary  
• Document p ain intensity ( NRS ) at rest and after ambulation each day since discharge from 
the inpatient unit  
• Perform surgical site assessment and neurosensory exam of the foot proximal to the surgical 
site with contralateral comparison  
• Document c oncomitant medication use including doses and times taken for analgesic 
medications  
• Document concom itant treatment use including topi[INVESTIGATOR_149170]

Subjects will return to the study center on D 29±2, or if applicable  at premature study 
discontinuation  (early termination or  ET), for the following assessments:  
• Subject home diary review ( NRS scores  at rest and after ambulation each day since 
the last visit  and pain medication  usage , if ET is ≤ Day 8) 
• Perform surgical site assessment and neurosensory exam of the foot proximal to the surgical 
site with contralateral comparison

• Pregnancy  
• Use of unacceptable concomitant medication(s)  
• It is not considered in the best interest  of the subject to continue  
• Administrative reasons (e.g., termination of enrollment or study)  
The Investigator must maintain a record of all subjects who discontinue from the study prior to 
completion; the reason(s) for study discontinuation will be docume nted.  If a subject chooses to 
withdraw from the study, the Investigator should make a reasonable attempt to obtain and record 
the reason(s) for withdrawal in as much detail as possible, although the subject is not obligated to 
provide such a reason.  
If a subject is discontinued while at the clinical site, the early termination procedures should be 
performed prior to discharge from the clinical site.  The investigator should ask the subject to 
participate in f ollow -up procedures, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent for such 
procedures.   If the subject refuses to complete early termination/ follow -up procedures or

PO Oxycodone   1.5 
PO Tramadol   0.1 
For an y IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480],  we will use a 2 -step process to calculate its oral (PO) morphine 
equivalent dose (MED).   
1. Convert its IV dose to IV morphine MED by [CONTACT_149195].   
2. Once the IV morphine MED is calculated, convert to the PO morphi ne MED 
using the conversion factor  for PO equivalence . 
For any PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], use the conversion factor to calculate the PO MED.  
*Note that for non -tolerant patients, we are using the 6:1 conversion for IV to PO 
morphine , or in other words, 10 mg IV morphine =  60 mg PO morphine . 
10.5. Safety Assessments  
Safety monitoring will be performed throughout the study for all subjects.   All AEs, regardless of 
causality or severity, will be recorded on the AE CRF.  
10.5.1.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Appropriate screening labs  will be performed at the site’s local  laboratory.  It is the responsibility 
of the Investigator to review and sign all lab reports expeditiously, and to document appropriate 
safety monitoring of study subjects.  The Investigator should sign and date each lab report 
concurrent with her or his review and should indicate the clinical significance of each 
abnormal/flagged value by [CONTACT_12542] “NCS” (not clinically significant) or “CS” (clinically 
significant), for example.  Notations indicating that a value is clinical ly significant should also 
include a brief description of the underlying disease or condition that is associated with the 
value, e.g., “CS/mild anemia.”  In general , and as determined by [CONTACT_093], abnormal, 
clinically significant laboratory values are expected to be associated with an item recorded in 
medical history or with an AE.  
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 45 of 73 Blood samples will be collected, processed, and shipped according to instructions from the local  
lab. Additional samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigato r if the results of any 
tests fall outside reference ranges or clinical symptoms necessitate testing to ens ure safety and to 
verify return to normal or to a new baseline. S uggested s pecific screening assessments are as 
follows:  
• CBC  
• Blood Chemistry: sodium , potassium, calcium, chloride, creatinine and glucose  
• Serum and urine pregnancy test for FCBP: βhCG test at screening and urine test 
usually to be done within 24 hours prior to surgery.  
• Urinalysis if indicated  
10.5.2.  Urine Drug Screen and Alcohol Breath Test  
Urine drug screen and alcohol breath tests will be complet ed at screening and pre -procedure.  All 
subjects will be tested for drugs -of-abuse (i.e. amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC) , methadone, methamphetamine, 
tricyclic anti -depressant s, and o xycodone).  
The drug and alcohol screens may be performed in -house at the Clinical Unit.  If any of these 
tests are positive (note exception for THC below), the subject will not be allowed further 
participation in the trial.  A positive test may be repeated  at the discretion of the PI.  Note that for 
those subjects who test positive for THC, if they are willing to abstain from use (e.g., 
inhalational) or consumption of THC -containing products from 3 days prior to surgery to the D8 
visit, they may be allow ed to participate in the study.  
10.5.3.  X-Ray 
An X -ray of the surgical site will be performed during screening (or verified as previously done) 
and at D29/ET  (cohorts 1 -3 only) . 
10.5.4.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination (PE) including all major body system s (HEENT, neurologic, 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, dermatologic and musculoskeletal systems) will be 
performed at Screening and an interim PEs prior to Surgery .  Evaluation of the surgical site and 
neurosensory testing of both lower extre mities  should be performed at specific times .   
Body weight (kg), in indoor clothing, but without shoes, and h eight in centimeters (cm) will be 
measured  to calculate  BMI at Screening.  BMI shall be calculated as kg/m2.  Use the NIH 
website BMI calculator http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmi -m.htm . 
10.5.5.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time the subject has signed t he ICF until 
D29 (cohorts 1 -3) or D8 (cohort 4), and , if necessary,  later to follow an AE to resolution or

that occur between Screening and the study procedure should be considered medical history and 
be added to the subject’s medical record.  Serious AEs and AEs that have been designated as 
possibly related to CA-008 will be fo llowed until resolution or stabilization.  Further details on 
AEs, including definitions, elicitation, and reporting are provided in Section  11.

10.6.1.  Efficacy Endpoints  
Using NRS scores (at rest and wit h ambulation) , pain intensity  over the 72h inpatient stay  will be  
assessed .   
10.6.2.  Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints include the following:  
• Incidence of TEAEs  and SAEs  
• Surgical Site assessment findings  
• Neurosensory testing results  
• X-ray healing of the surgical site (cohorts 1 -3 only)  
• Absence of rebound pain at the surgical site  (cohorts 1 -3 only)

11.1. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The following definitions, developed in accordance with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal 
Regulations (CF R) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Clinical Safety 
Data Management Guidance for Industry, E2A, will be used to identify AEs in this study.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or increase in severity of a preexisting abnormality, temporally  associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A “suspected adverse reaction” means any AE for which there is a reasonable  possibility that the 
drug caused th e event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   
11.1.1.  Relationship  to CA-[ADDRESS_171708] abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to CA-008 or Exparel  administration which  makes a causal 
relationship improbable or if other drugs, chemicals or underlying 
disease provide more plausible  explanations.  
While temp oral sequence may be an important factor in determining 
causality: i.e., whether the observed reaction or event began after the 
CA-008 or Exparel , it may well be that the surgery, anesthesia, a 
concurrent medical condition or concomitant medications admini stered 
during or after surgery were more likely than not to be responsible for 
the AE.  The investigator should use clinical judgment to evaluate the 
evidence and determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
CA-008 or Exparel  actually caused th e AE or whether based upon the 
evidence it is more likely that something else is responsible.  If the 
former, choose “possibly related” and if the latter, “unlikely related.”   
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 48 of 73 For the purpose of this protocol, the term “unlikely related” will be 
considere d an AE not related to CA-[ADDRESS_171709] abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to CA-008 or Exparel  administration, which also may be 
explained by [CONTACT_149196].  In such 
cases, if the investigator using clinical judgment is unable to rule out a 
reasonable possibility that CA-008 or Exparel  was partly responsible, 
then choose “possibly related.”  
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has possible re lationship 
to CA-008 or Exparel  will be defined as a “Suspected Adverse Drug 
Reaction”.   
Probably related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to CA-008 or Exparel  administration, in which the 
investigator has determined that the event is unlikely to be attributed to 
other factors.    
For the purpose of this protocol, an event that has probable relationship 
to CA-008 or Exparel  will be defined as an “Adverse Drug Reaction”.  
 
11.1.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs m ust be entered on the AE CRF, regardless of causality or severity. AEs include new 
AEs, worsening baseline conditions, clinically significant laboratory findings, disease -related 
signs and symptoms that were not present at baseline, and any events or findi ngs that the 
Investigator feels are clinically significant.  
Disease -related signs and symptoms that are present at baseline should not be recorded as AEs 
unless they worsen in severity or increase in frequency.  
Information collected concerning AEs will inc lude the following:  
▪ Name [CONTACT_12581]  
▪ Onset date  
▪ Resolution date  
▪ Severity (i.e., mild, moderate, severe or potentially life -threatening)  
▪ Relationship  
▪ Action and outcome  
▪ Seriousness of event  
All SAEs will be documented and followed from the time the subjec t has signed the ICF until 
D29 visit (cohorts 1 -3) or D8 visit (cohort 4) after the completion of surgery.  All SAEs and non -
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 49 of 73 serious AEs will be documented and followed from the time of administration of CA-008 or 
Exparel  until D29  or D8, respectively,  or later if necessary. AEs /SAEs  that occur between 
Screening and the administration of study medication should be considered medical history and 
added to the subject’s medical record, unless the AE is due to a study -related procedure (such as 
phlebotomy), in w hich case it will be recorded as a non -treatment emergent AE.  Serious AEs 
and AEs that have been designated as possibly related to CA-008/Exparel  will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization.  
11.1.3.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE or reaction is any adv erse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
▪ Death  
▪ Is life -threatening (at the time of the event)  
▪ Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
▪ Results in persistent or significan t disability/incapacity  
▪ Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in an offspring)  
▪ An Important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
For cohorts 1 -3, all AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a pre -existing

recorded on the appropr iate CRF: study specified hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], short -term administrative 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84748], tests or treatments of conditions that would not otherwise 
constitute an SAE, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].

Serious AEs must b e reported to the Sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_171711] is receiving CA-008 and within 14 days following the 
study completion visit (or 21 days following an ET if applicable) are reportable withi n 24 hours. 
During this follow -up period beyond study completion or after an ET, only those SAEs 
considered to be possibly related to CA-008 or Exparel should be reported within 24 hours.

discovery) by [CONTACT_149197].  Calls related to SAEs should first 
be directed to the CRO Medical Monitor or designee.  
o CRO Medical Monitor: Jon Ruckle, MD  
o 24/[ADDRESS_171712]: [PHONE_1987] /  ([PHONE_3327]

▪ The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor is available for questions about safety -related issues:  
Mike A. Royal, MD JD MBA; 858 -204-1112 or [EMAIL_3059].  
▪ The initial report should inc lude all information known at the time of the report (additional 
information can be reported as discovered). Do not delay the initial reporting in order to 
obtain resolution or follow -up information.  
▪ The site will enter into the electronic database (or fax , if the database cannot be accessed for 
any reason) an SAE report, or similar form, that includes the following information, as 
available:  
o Subject ID  
o Basic demographic information (age, gender, weight)  
o Outcomes attributed to the event (death, life -threate ning hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [new or 
prolonged], disability, congenital anomaly, required medical intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment/damage, etc.)  
o Onset date and severity of the event  
o Brief description of the event including frequency and severity of sym ptoms leading 
to diagnosis  
o List of relevant test results and laboratory data  
o Any other relevant history  
o Whether CA-008 or Exparel was discontinued  
o Investigator ’s assessment of causality  
The CRO Medical Monitor or another representative of the Sponsor may c ontact the Investigator 
to request additional information regarding the event or to confirm information. All SAEs will be 
entered on the AE CRF. The same nomenclature should be used on both the SAE report and the 
AE CRF.  The Investigator is responsible fo r the complete and timely reporting of all SAEs to 
the Sponsor (or designee), reporting pertinent follow -up information on the SAE, and notifying 
the appropriate IRB of the occurrence of and details surrounding the event. In the event there is a 
question a s to whether the AE is serious, the event should be reported.

Version: 02 May  2019        Page 51 of 73 11.1.4.  Severity Grading for AEs  
Grading the severity of AEs is per investigator discretion ( Section  17.G ).   Additionally, the 
following general guideline may be helpful:  
• Grade 1 (mild) = asymptomatic or mild symptoms requiring no treatment, only clinical or 
diagnostic observation  
• Grade 2 (moderate) = event or symptoms limit age -appropriate activities of daily living 
(ADLs) more than is expected from the surgery itself, requ iring minimal treatment or 
local noninvasive intervention indicated.   
• Grade 3 (severe) = medically -significant but not immediately life -threatening, 
significantly limiting of self -care ADLs, requiring of medical treatment and may require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o r prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
11.2. Pregnancy  
If a female subject become s pregnant at any time during the study, the Investigator must notify 
the CRO Medical Monitor or designee within [ADDRESS_171713] through the pregnancy term, and report to the 
CRO Medical Monitor or designee the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal or neonatal 
outcome. Information on the status of the mother and the child will be forwarded to the CRO 
Medical Monitor or designee. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will also be reported 
on this form. Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an SAE, 
any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnanc y for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE and will be followed as such. A spontaneous abortion is considered to be an 
SAE.

This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requiremen ts. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee may conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 12.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigator and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audi t of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, completeness, and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. The Sponsor or designee will 
review source documents for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits and 
after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator, as 
appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non -compliance will be investigated and remedial action instituted 
when appropria te. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigational site 
termination and regulatory authority notification.  
12.1. Data Collection  
Source documents include, but are not limited to, original documents, data and records such as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/medic al records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, 
participant diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and 
pharmacy records, etc. This study will use electronic data capture (EDC). At a minim um, all data 
required by [CONTACT_149198].  
All CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_12555]’s monitor or 
designated representative. The Sponsor’s monitor or de signated representative will review all 
source records on -site and compare them to the data collected on the CRF.  All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by [CONTACT_12556]. 
All data entries will be veri fied for accuracy and correctness by [CONTACT_12557]. The 
electronic data capture system maintains a full audit trail.  
12.2. Study Auditing and Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing CRFs for accuracy and 
complete ness) will be performed by [CONTACT_1034]’s designated monitor(s). The extent, nature, and 
frequency of on -site visits will be based on such considerations as the study objectives and/or

Version: 02 May  2019        Page 53 of 73 endpoints, the purpose of the study, study design complexity, and enroll ment rate. By [CONTACT_12558], the Investigator agrees that, within local regulatory restrictions and institutional and 
ethical considerations, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and/or 
an IRB may visit the site to perf orm audits or inspections, including the drug storage area, CA-
[ADDRESS_171714]. The purpose of the Sponsor audit or inspection is to 
systematically  and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether the study -related activities were conducted, and data recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, the site’s standard operating procedures , GCP 
guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_12559] a regulatory agency regarding an inspection.

13.1. Statistical and Analytical Plans  
This section  describe s the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety.  The 
final analysis plan  will be documented in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be 
finalized before database lock.  The SAP will include details on how vari ables will be derived, 
how missing data will be handled, and how data will be presented as well as the details on 
statistical methods to be used for safety and efficacy analyses.  The final clinical study report 
will discuss deviations from the SAP, if any . 
13.2. Sample Size Justification  
The currently planned study is a follow -on exploratory study to a prior phase 2 study (CA -PS-
201) which showed CA -[ADDRESS_171715], therefore no sample size 
estimation was performed.  It was felt that a comparison of 9 in each treatment cohort  would be 
sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of any anesthesia combination.   
13.3. Analysis Populations  
The following ana lysis populations are planned for this study:  
• The Safety Population will include all subjects who received at least part of a dose of CA-
008 or Exparel .   
• The Study Completer  Population  will include all subjects who complete the D29 visit  
(cohorts 1 -3) or  D8 visit (cohort 4).  
Subjects who elect to discontinue study participation during the inpatient phase of the study, will 
be asked to continue with assessments through T 72h if they have not elected to withdraw from 
all aspects of study participation.  Subj ects who elect to discontinue participation after discharge 
from the inpatient unit but prior to D8 will be considered to have terminated as of the date of 
their election, however they will be asked to return to the site to reassess the surgical site for 
wound healing.  
All safety and efficacy assessments and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the 
Safety Population.  All summaries will be grouped by [CONTACT_84810].    
13.4. Planned Analyses  
Summary statistics will be provided for the variables described in the following sections. For 
continuous variables, these statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_149176], mean,

statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_149177].  
13.5. Study Subjects and Demographics  
13.5.1.  Disposition and Withdrawals  
The numbers of subjects enrolling, completing and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_1570].   The number of subjects in each 
analysis population will be reported.  
13.5.2.  Protocol Deviations  
All protocol deviations will be classified and documented before database lock and will be 
discussed in the CSR.  All protocol deviations, both minor s and majors, will be presented in a 
data listing.  
13.5.3.  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race, weight, and height) will be 
summarized for each treatment group and for the overall popul ation by [CONTACT_9086]. 
Medical history and screening clinical laboratory tests will be listed.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_149199], classified us ing World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classes and preferred terms.  
13.5.4.  Exposure  
Since this is a single dose study, CA-008 or Exparel administration will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_82187].  
13.5.5.  General Consideration s 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) 
using the descriptive statistics n, mean, SD, median, and range (minimum, and maximum).  
Categorical assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_149200] t (as applicable) using 
frequency counts and rates of occurrence (%).  Changes from baseline for continuous outcomes 
will be presented as their corresponding continuous measures for post -baseline visits.  All study 
data will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], subject and time point.  
No preliminary rounding will be performed; rounding will only occur after the analysis.  Means 
and medians will be presented with one more decimal place than the precision of the data.  
Standard deviations will be presented with two  more decimal places than the precision of the 
data.  Percentages will be presented with one decimal place.  A percentage of 0% or 100% will 
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 56 of 73 be reported as 0% or 100%, respectively.  Minimums and maximums will be presented with the 
same precision as the or iginal data.  
All analyses will be performed using the SAS System® version 9.3 or higher. The domain 
(Study data tabulation Model [SDTM]) and analysis (Analysis Data Model [ADaM]) data sets 
will be taken as input to the SAS programs that generate the report -ready tables, figures and 
listings. The submission ready SDTM and ADaM data sets will be provided to the sponsor along 
with display deliveries. The specifications for the domain data sets and analysis data sets will be 
provided in a separate document.  
The following conventions will be used throughout the study analysis:  
• Time T0 hNRS is the time of entry to the PACU .  
• Day of surgery is defined as D0  
• Assessment visit times are defined by [CONTACT_5586] T0 NRS /D0. 
• Baseline value is defined as the last valid measurement prior to beginning CA-008 
administration.  
• Change from baseline is defined as post -baseline value minus baseline value.  
• Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and as 
hours for AEs lasting less than 24 hours.  Durati on in hours will be calculated as the stop 
date/time of the event minus the start date/time.  Duration in days will be calculated by [CONTACT_149201] +[ADDRESS_171717] in the  
database, whichever is later.  Missing dates will be imputed as described in the Study’s 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
• The number of days in the study is computed as: [Date of study completion or withdrawal 
minus the da te of study drug administration (Day 1)] + 1.  
• If duplicate values are obtained at a given visit (e.g., repeated vital sign measurements), the 
last value will be used unless it is noted that the measurement was in error for that value. 
Values that compromi se interpretation will not be used in summaries (e.g., values that were 
obtained post -dose will not be summarized as pre -dose values).  
13.6. Analysis of Efficacy Measures  
All efficacy endpoints (e.g., NRS scores), will be summarized over time by [CONTACT_149202].   Details may be found it the 
study statistical analysis plan (SAP)  
AUC calculations will be done using the standard trapezoidal rule  
Clinical Trial Protocol CA -PS-205            Confidential  
Version: 02 May  2019        Page 57 of 73 AUC  =     ∑ (𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+𝑁𝑅𝑆 𝑖+1
2)𝑥
𝑖=0 ∗ (𝑇𝑖+1− 𝑇𝑖) 
Where:  NRS i = NRS at time i, and (T i+1 – Ti) is the Time difference in minutes between time i 
and time i+1.  A similar calculation and handling of missing data will be performed for the NRS 
scores with ambulation.  
In this study, sub jects are permitted to take rescue medication for analgesia.  During both 
inpatient and outpatient portions of the study , the subjects will be instructed to record NRS  
immediately prior (within approximately 15 min) to taking rescue medication.  
Missing NRS  will be handled as discussed in the Study’s SAP and as briefly outlined in Section 
13.6.1 .   
13.6.1.  Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data  
All efforts will be made to minimize missing data.  These efforts will include the following:  
• Subjects are required to consent continuous data collection even after subjects 
discontinue CA-008 or Exparel ; 
• Continue data collection after subjects taking rescue medication;  
• Establish robust efficacy data collection procedures.  
With the p rocedures above, it is expected that the missing would be minimal.   
For subjects who take rescue  medication a windowed last pain score carried forward (LOCF) 
will be used.  The pre -rescue pain score will be used to impute scheduled  assessments for 30 min 
after IV fentanyl and 4 hours  following  PO oxycodone .  Intermittent missing pain scores (due to 
subject sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], etc.) will not  be imputed, and AUC will be calculated based on non -missing 
values.  For subjects who drop out  of the study prior to Day 15, sche duled assessments  will first 
be imputed using the worst prior pain score carried forward (WOCF).  As sensitivity analyses, the 
AUC will also be calculated where assessments after drop out will be imputed using LOCF, 
using the last scheduled non missing pain  score prior to drop out  or replacing drop out with the 
median data from the remainder of subjects in that treatment group . 
For secondary continuous efficacy endpoints, similar methods as the primary analysis will be 
used.  For categorical endpoints, when assessments are imputed for data after a subject 
discontinues from the study, a WOCF method will be used.  
Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy variable using different methods of imputation for 
rescue medication may also be performed.  Additional s ensitivity analysis with different missing 
value imputation methods for subjects who drop out of the study may also be performed.   All 
imputation methods for pain intensity will be documented in the SAP.

Safety analyses will be conducte d using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section  13.3).  
Safety will be assessed through TEAEs , surgical site and neurosensory assessments.  
No formal statistical comparisons will be performed for safety endpoints.  
13.7.1.  Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) reporting system. Treatment -emergent AEs are 
defined as any of the following:  
▪ Non-serious AEs with onset on the date of treatment through D29 (cohorts 1 -3) or D8 (cohort 
4) or Early Termination, whichever occurs first;  
▪ Serious AEs with onset on the date of surgery  through D29 (cohorts 1 -3) or D8 (cohort 4) or 
Early Termination, whicheve r occurs first;  
▪ AEs that start before the start of treatment but increase in severity or relationship at the time 
of or following the start of treatment through D29 (cohorts 1 -3) or D8 (cohort 4) or Early 
Termination, whichever occurs first.  
The number and  percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be displayed for each treatment group 
by [CONTACT_9315]. Additionally, TEAEs will be tabulated for each treatment group by 
[CONTACT_149203]-008. A listing of SAEs will be provided if app licable.

For all assessments, the foot should be warm.  
• Foot Inspection : The feet are inspected for evidence of excessively dry skin, callous formation, fissures, 
frank ulceration or deformities. Deformities include flat feet, hammer toes, over lappi[INVESTIGATOR_149180], hallux valgus, 
joint subluxation, prominent metatarsal heads, medial convexity (Charcot foot) and amputation.  
• Monofilament Sensation Testing:  For this examination, it is important that the patient’s foot be supported 
(i.e., allow the sole of  the foot to rest on a flat, warm surface). The filament should initially be prestressed 
(4-6 perpendicular applications to the dorsum of the examiner’s first finger). The filament is then applied 
to the dorsum of the great toe midway between the nail fold  and the DIP joint. Do not hold the toe directly. 
The filament is applied perpendicularly and briefly, (<1 second) with even pressure.  When the filament 
bends, the force of [ADDRESS_171727], whose eyes are closed, is asked to respon d yes 
if he / she feels the filament.  Eight correct responses out of 10 applications is considered normal: one to 
seven correct responses indicate reduced sensation and no correct responses translates into absent 
sensation.  
• Testing for Allodynia: testing should be performed bilaterally with the great toe unsupported. Allodynia 
will be tested using a foam brush applied to the dorsum of the great toe.  The foam brush will be lightly 
stroked [ADDRESS_171728] w ill be asked to compare sensation 
of toe on the surgical side with the toe on the nonsurgical side.  If the sensation is described as painful or 
very unpleasant then allodynia will be reported as present.  If sensation is not felt a t all then it will be 
reported as absent.

Page 3 of 116Diagnosis and Main Criteria for  Inclusion of Study Subjects:
This study targets critically ill subjects with severe sepsis requiring the level of care that 
is normally associated with treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The inclusion criteria for organ dysfunction and c oagulopathy must be met within a [ADDRESS_666890] be receiving treatment in an ICU or in an acute  care setting (e.g., 
Emergency Room, Recovery Room).
2. Subjects with:
a. Clinical objective evidence of  bacterial infection and a known site of 
infection (Refer to Appendix C, Section 15.3).
b. Current treatment wit h intravenous antibiotics.
c. White Blood Cell (WBC) count greater than (>) 12,000/mm
3or less than (<) 
4,000/mm3or Bandemia greater than (>) 10%.
d. Temperature of < 36ºC or fever > 38ºC. For hypothermia, a core re ading is 
preferred.
Note 1: If a subject has a Gram stain consistent with bacterial infection, positive
culture from blood or an otherwis e sterile body fluid, observed  peritonitis, positive 
urinary antigen, clinical presentation of meningococcemia, or ot herwise 
compelling evidence of infection as determined by [CONTACT_145859], only  one of the two 
inclusion criteria # 2c (WBC) or 2 d (temperature) is required. 
Note 2: The presence of concurrent  fungal or viral infection is al lowed for the 
study entry, provided that the pr imary reason for treatment is bacterial infection.
3. Subjects with sepsis-associated organ dysfunction defined by [CONTACT_106462]:
a. Cardiovascular Dysfunction defin ed as requiring both adequate fluid 
resuscitation and vasopressors*to maintain Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) 
greater than or equal to (>) 65 mmHg (implies fluid resuscitation alo ne does 
not raise MAP to > 65 mmHg). Adequa te fluid resuscitation is def ined as:
oIntravenous administration of at least 20 mL/kg crystalloid or 
10 mL/kg colloid infusion within 6 hours.
OR

Pulmonary Artery Wedge Pressure (PAWP) of greater than ( >) 
12 mmHg.
*If dopamine is the only vasopressor used, the infusion rate must be greater 
than (>) 5 μg/kg/min (i.e., must be prescribed to support cardio-pulmonary 
perfusion). If vasopressin is used, it mu st be given in conjunction with another 
vasopressor.
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_514601]2/FiO2 ratio of <250 (or < 200 when lung is the site of 
infection). For the purposes of t his protocol, mechanical ventil ation is defined 
as any type of ventilation adminis tered via an endotracheal tub e or 
nasotracheal intubation. A simple  administration of supplementa l oxygen is 
NOT considered to be mechanical  ventilation for the purposes of this study.
4. Subjects with coagulopathy characterized by [CONTACT_514678] >1.40 with out other known 
etiology (e.g., anticoagulant  therapy, chronic liver disease)
5. Subjects with coagulopathy ch aracterized by [CONTACT_284500] i n the range of greater 
than (>) 30,000/mm3to less than (<) 150,000/mm3ORa greater than 30% decrease 
in platelets in [ADDRESS_666891], Dosage  and Mode of Administration: 
ART-123 - thrombomodulin alpha:
ART-123 or Placebo, are administere d at the equivalent dose of 0 .06 mg/kg/day up to a 
maximum dose of 6.0 mg/day for six days.  ART-123 is given by i ntravenous bolus or 
rapid IV infusion, in which case 0.06 mg/kg/day up to a maximum  dose of 6.0 mg/day is 
diluted in 50 mL of Normal Salin e (NS) and given over a period of [ADDRESS_666892] 5 m L of 0.9% Saline solution both  prior to and 
following the administrati on of study drug or placebo .
ART-123 is supplied as individual glass ampules containing 6.0 mg of formulated drug 
in 1 mL of total volume, with an overfill of 0.1 mL*. Ampules must be refrigerated at 2ºC-
8ºC and protected from light during storage.
*Refer to Section 3.[ADDRESS_666893].

the following assumptions are made:
1) 5% two-sided Alpha level2) 8% treatment effect (24% plac ebo mortality rate vs. 16% ART-1 23 mortality rate).
The assumed treatment effect of 8% is based upon the results of  post-hoc analyses from 
the Phase IIb study.
Informed Consent:
Fully informed consent will be obtained before any study specif ic procedures are 
performed in accordance with all applicable ethical and regulat ory requirements. It is 
anticipated, by [CONTACT_514680] t hemselves due to various 
reasons including sedation, uncons cious state, etc. and at no t ime will medical treatment 
be delayed to secure authorized informed consent for study part icipation. Therefore, the 
following will be applied as long as your local laws allow:
xConsent from an Authorized or Legally Authorized Representative  (AR / LAR) /
next of kin / legally appo inted individual in person;
xVerbal consent from an AR/LAR / next of kin / legally appointed individual via
telephone, confirmed by  [CONTACT_514681] l (at least 
2 people from the study site are required, one to administer the  informed consent 
and the second as a witness);

required by [CONTACT_427]; 
xIn extreme and urgent circumstances when emergent action is req uired to mitigate 
the risk of death, it is understood that the presumed will of t he subject will be 
determined by a physician and documented based on his/her knowl edge of the 
study subject. As appropriate, an independent physician, who is  a qualified 
medical doctor with at least one year’s experience in intensive  care medicine but 
must be from another department  and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514603], may sign 
the informed consent for the subject if the local laws, regulat ions and ethics 
committees approve this process. In countries where permissible , this independent 
physician may be from the same department. The study subject mu st be presented 
with the informed consent as soon as it is possible and reasonab le, and informed 
consent obtained for continued st udy participation. The AR/LAR may act as an 
agent on the subject’s behalf once they are available to provid e informed consent. 
In addition, where local regulatory and/or ethics committees al low, advance consent may 
be obtained prior to study ent ry in an attempt to obtain person al consent from the subject 
themselves. Should a subject who is enrolled in the study on th e basis of advance consent 
subsequently become unable to mak e medical decisions for him/he rself, then the subject's 
legally acceptable AR/LAR indepe ndent physician should be infor med of the subject's 
participation in the trial.

Protocol 3-[ADDRESS_666905] several decades, mor tality from sepsis remains 
unacceptably high. The risk of death is related to the severity  of the sepsis, which is 
characterized in terms of the pres ence of organ dysfunctions an d coagulopathy.
1.1.1 Sepsis
Sepsis has been defined as infection complicated by a systemic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS).1,3A reassessment of sepsis raised concerns that the SIRS criteria  were too 
sensitive, and that the approach to sepsis continued to need re finement.2,3Surviving Sepsis 
Campaign Guidelines provide diagnostic criteria for sepsis as w ell as a definition of severe 
sepsis in which the diagnostic criteria for sepsis includes the n ecessity for infection and 
inflammatory response, and that s evere sepsis is characterized by [CONTACT_514684]3.
Numerous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_514612], and all but one, Drotrecogi n alfa (recombinant human 
activated protein C, Xigris®), have failed to show evidence of efficacy,4,5,6Xigris, which 
showed evidence of efficacy in early clinical trials, was withd rawn from the market by [CONTACT_13989] (Eli Lilly and Co.) on October 25, 2011.
In contrast, mortality has been r educed by [CONTACT_514685]7
or the introduction of bundles of treatments that target variou s physiologic manifestations of 
sepsis.8
1.1.2 Coagulopathy
It has been known for a long time that coagulopathy is associat ed with increased mortality in 
sepsis.9While thrombocytopenia is an inde pendent risk factor, its role i n increased mortality 
is less clear, and may not be a result of coagulopathy.10Disseminated Intravascular 
Coagulation (DIC) has been well- described as an important risk factor for mortality in sepsis.[ADDRESS_666906] been confounded by [CONTACT_514686].16
Irrespective of these findings,  modulation of coagulation is a credible approach towards the 
realization of improved prognosis  for subjects with sepsis and coagulopathy.  
1.2 Mechanism of Action
ART-123 is a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (thrombomo dulin alpha).
Endothelial membrane bound and so luble forms of thrombomodulin are part of a network of 
endogenous anti-coagulant proteins that also possess potent ant i-inflammatory activities in the 
presence of sepsis.17The primary mechanism of protection afforded by [CONTACT_514687] t 
soluble thrombomodulin is derived from its capacity to bind cir culating thrombin molecules 
and serve as an activ ation complex to conve rt protein C to acti vated protein C (APC).
Soluble thrombomodulin possesses an array of activities which a re also relevant in its 
mechanism of protection in sepsis. Soluble thrombomodulin avidly  binds thrombin and the 
thrombin: thrombomodulin complex can no longer bind to fibrinoge n substrates to generate 
fibrin clots. Additionally, thrombin-soluble thrombomodulin com plexes activate a plasma 
procarboxypeptidase B species know n as TAFI (thrombin activatab le fibrinolysis inhibitor). 
Furthermore, soluble thrombomodu lin has intrinsic anti-inflamma tory properties separate from
its ability to inactivate thrombin and generate APC.  In experi mental models of sepsis soluble
thrombomodulin reduces the expre ssion of pro-inflammatory cytok ines and chemokines, 
attenuates endot helial cell adhesion molecule expression, limit s neutrophil- endothelial 
interactions and lowers circulating levels of the late acting m ediator of sepsis High Mobility

Patients requiring Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) for chronic o r acute renal failure, were 
prohibited from being included in  the previous Phase IIb trial an d the current Phase III trial 
because the clearance of ART-123 in humans is mainly renal and be cause of the lack of clinical 
information such as the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety in thi s population. In addition, 
subjects who required RRT post study enrollment were required b y protocol to discontinue the 
study drug administration. A Phase I trial studying the safety a nd PK of ART-123 subjects with 
impaired renal function and in healthy subjects with normal ren al function was completed. This 
study included the collection of PK and safety data of ART-123 in end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) subjects undergoing hemodial ysis. Based on the data from t his study the Sponsor has 
modified the exclusion criteria related to RRT thereby [CONTACT_514689].
Over 120,[ADDRESS_666908]-
marketing studies indicate that ART-123 is safe and well tolera ted. Details on all previous 
investigations using ART-123 can  be found in the current versio n of the Investigator’s 
Brochure.
2 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
2.1 Overall Study Design
This is a randomized, double-b lind, placebo-controlled, multi-c enter, parallel-group study of 
ART-123 in subjects with coagulopathy due to severe sepsis and a concurrent diagnosis of 
shock and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_514613] v entilation for hypoxemia. At 
randomization, subjects who meet  all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be 
randomly assigned, in a 1:1 rati o, to receive ART-123 in a dose  of 0.06 mg/kg/day up to a 
maximum dose of 6 mg/day or a matching placebo for 6 consecutiv e days. These doses will be 
administered as an intravenous  bolus injection or diluted in 50  mL of NS and infused over the 
period of 15 minutes. Blood samples for assessing coagulation an d inflammation parameters, 
ART-123 concentration, organ dys function and safety laboratory tests will be obtained 
between baseline assessments and the end of the study procedure s. Safety-related assessments 
will include reports of adverse events, monitoring for the degr ee of burden and risk threshold, 
and assessing continua tion of treatment with ART-123/placebo dur ing the dosing period Day 
1-6, ECGs and clinical laboratory test results.

Page 20 of 1162.2 Study Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:
xTo evaluate whether ART-123, when administered to subjects with  bacterial infection 
complicated by [CONTACT_514690],  can reduce mortality.
xTo evaluate the safety of ART-123 in this patient population. 
Secondary objectives include:
xAssessment of the efficacy of ART-[ADDRESS_666909] likely to respond to ART-123, perhaps b ecause of changes in the 
methods of identifying subjects with DIC. These studies did not  require organ dysfunction 
other than DIC.  Analysis of data from the global Phase IIb tri al showed that subjects with 
cardiac or respi[INVESTIGATOR_514614] s tudy entry had better response 
to treatment than subjects wit hout these conditions and it was not always feasible to identify 
the cause of renal or hepatic dys function as seps is or “other”.
The population for the present study will be limited to subject s with cardiovascular and/or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_26517], plus c oagulopathy in addition to infec tion characterized by a known 
site of the infection, fever/hypothermia and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_514615]

Protocol 3-[ADDRESS_666910] (serum or urine hCG) obtained during the current  admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The 
active drug ART-123 has a half- life of approximately 20 hours. Study drug is administered for 
up to 6 days to subjects who are either in shock and/or on a ven tilator. Ten half-lives will have 
passed [ADDRESS_666911] dose;  therefore, there is no reaso nable likelihood that such study 
subjects will become pregnant durin g the period that drug is pre sent in the patient.
The dose and duration of treatme nt have been established in pre clinical and clinical trials.

as ART-123, i.e., Placebo must not b e administered concurrently wi th any other medications 
and the IV line that is used for administering placebo must be flushed with at least 5 mL of 
0.9% Saline solution both prior to a nd following administration  of study drug or placebo.
3.[ADDRESS_666937] unblinding will  be handled as a serious adverse 
event in accordance with the procedures outlined in this protoc ol. Any broken blind will need 
to be clearly justified, explained by a comment within the Elec tronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF), and captured on the Serious Adverse Event Form.
The treatment assignment for the subject can be determined by t he Investigator only and only 
by [CONTACT_514697]. The Investigator must record the date, time and the rea son for the unblinding in the 
subject’s study chart.
Protocol 3-[ADDRESS_666938] 
below outlines which study specific laboratory blood draws are for central laboratory draws 
(using the provided central laboratory kit) and which are for l ocal laboratory draws (using 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514628]).  If Sta ndard of Care (SOC) local labs  for Organ Dysfunction (OD) are 
to be drawn on the days where study drug is administered, we sug gest these be drawn within [ADDRESS_666939]  of Care labs are drawn, use 
the PaO2/FiO2 (for ventilated s ubjects) results for the Organ D ysfunction assessments. If an 
ABG is not performed as SOC, a Pulse Oximetry O 2saturation may be used for calculating the 
PaO2/FiO2 (Refer to
 . For centers that 
may be at an altitude  of more than 1000 meters, an adjustment ma y be needed for purposes of 
calculating PaO2/FiO2.
To avoid contamination or clotting, all coagulation tests taken  for the purposes of this study 
should be obtained from an origin al arterial stick or venipunct ure. If it is not possible to obtain 
blood from an original stick or venipuncture, blood may be coll ected from an arterial line in 
which no Heparin is infused. The arterial line will be flushed with NS both prior to and after 
the blood draw. No coagulation samples can be obtained from a H eparin infused or Heparin 
coated central line. Heparin must not be used when flushing an arterial line for this purpose. 
The site staff should use proper collection technique as descri bed in the Central Laboratory 
Manual.  If an original arterial stick or venipuncture is used then to avoid clotting, the 
coagulation test tubes should not  be the first tube of blood fil led. Any other non-coagulation 
blood tests unable to be obtained fro m the original arterial st ick or venipuncture may be taken 
from an existing port or line. If a central line is used, explor atory laboratory tests should be the 
last to be collected.

may act as an agent on the subject’s behalf once they are avail able to provide informed consent. 
The above guidelines apply to all areas of the protocol where I nformed Consent is referenced 
or required.
5.3 Baseline Visit (prior to dosing)
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria and have signed info rmed consent will be discussed 
with the CCC for authorization to randomize. After the CCC veri fies eligibility of the subject 
Protocol 3-[ADDRESS_666943] will be randomized by  [CONTACT_514698]/internet system.
Once the subject is randomized, the automated system will provide t he study staff with a unique 
randomization number for the subj ect and an assigned investigatio nal product kit number. The 
assigned kit should be ordered or obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_514630] l product storage location.

a   EOS = End of Study – When a subject is discontinued from the  study prior to Day 28 for any reason other than Death (i.e., wi thdrawal of consent as defined in Section 2.7.2 ). This 
does not include the subjects who discontinue study drug early,  but remain in the study for all other assessments.
b  This visit is performed when a subject is discharged from the h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_514638] 1-[ADDRESS_666966] remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514649] 6thdose. The Early Treatment Termination Visit is performed 24 hou rs (± 2 hours) after the last dose of study medication if study  drug administration was discontinued early or 
this window does not apply. This visit is done in pl ace of the daily study visit.
1. If the subject is to be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965] 1 3 perform the Day 14 visit in p lace of Day 13 visit (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514650]). ONLY if subject has been 
discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514651] a +[ADDRESS_666967] not be administered w ithin 12 hours of major surgery. (See Section 2.6.3.) All dosing times are based on the first dose of drug. 
The windows are: Day 2: 24 hours (±2 hours), Day 3: 48 hours (±2 hours), Day 4: 72 (±2 hours), Day 5: 96 hours (±2 hours) and Day 6: 120 hours (±2 hours). If IP is held 
due to surgery refer to Section 3. Dosing is discontinued when a subject is discharged from the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Administration of study drug is contraindicated if the co -administration of 
excluded concomitant medication (e.g. full heparinization, oral  anticoagulant, anti-platelets drug) is required for subject tr eatment, or has an intolerable adverse event, such as 
bleeding events or conditions that place the subject at high ri sk of bleeding.
3. Assessments are made within one hour after IP administration on  Dosing Days. If blood samples (central, local and Arterial Blood  Gas if vented, and not performed as SOC) and
ECG are required these are to be completed within (1) hour AFTER study drug administration. 
4.Within one (1) hour PRIOR to study drug administration, blood s amples will be collected.

7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND REPORTING
7.1 Adverse Events 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurre nce in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal r elationship with this treatment.  An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, sympto m, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (inve stigational) pr oduct, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal (investigati onal) product. A baseline event refers to  medical history that is present prior to 
the last inclusion criteria bein g met and obtaining informed co nsent. Examples of adverse events 
include:
xIncrease in severity of a baseline event
Protocol 3-[ADDRESS_666974] basel ine (consolidate to a diagnosis if 
available)
xA new event with an ons et date post baseline
xAn event present at baseline wher e more aggressive treatment or  an intervention/surgery is 
required post baseline (e.g. increase in total dosage per day, an invasive intervention such as chest 
tube insertion, debr idement, etc.).
All local and systemic adverse e vents, whether volunteered by t he subject, discovered by [CONTACT_514700], or detected through other means, will be collected  and recorded on the Adverse Event 
form and followed as appropriate.
Once the patient is authorized to randomize SAEs will be collec ted through Day 28. Once 
randomization has occurred both AEs and SAEs are collected. The DAIDS Toxicity/Adverse Event 
Grading Table (Appendix I ) will be used by [CONTACT_514701]. If Appendix I does not provide severity guidelin es for certain events, please  see Section 7.1.1
of the protocol.
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory A ctivities (MedDRA) terminology
by [CONTACT_514702].
Medical conditions/diseases present before authorization to rand omize are only considered AEs if 
they subsequently worsen in severity, require more aggressive tr eatment/intervention/surgery, or if 
they resolve then re-emerge. Whenever possible, a diagnosis wil l be used to describe the AE. If a 
diagnosis is not available, the event will be captured using si gns and symptoms. Each sign or 
symptom is its own AE until a diag nosis that they can be collap sed under is known.
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (both from cent ral or local laborat ories), if not part of 
a diagnosis, are required to be captured as AEs.
As far as possible, each AE will also be described by:  
[CONTACT_514703] (st art and end dates)
xThe severity grade (Grade 1/mild, Grade 2/moderate, Grade 3/seve re, Grade 4/Potentially life 
threatening as defined by [CONTACT_514704])
xThe relationship to the study  drug (none, unlikely, related)
xWhether the AE involved bleeding of any kind
xThe action(s) taken 
xThe outcome
Protocol 3-001 Confidential 28APRIL2017
Version 4.1 Asahi Kasei Pharma America Corporation
Page 58 of 116Major Bleeding Events
A Major Bleeding event is defined as:
xany intracranial hemorrhage,
xany life-threatening bleeding, 
xany bleeding event classified as  serious by [CONTACT_737] (e. g., resulting in permanent 
morbidity), 
xthe administration of at least 1440 mL (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 units) of packed  red cells over two consecutive 
days.6
Note: Should a major bleeding event oc cur, study product must be disc ontinued.
All major bleeding events must  be collected, documented, and pro mptly reported as SAEs.
Blood product administration w ill be recorded in the eCRF.
7.1.1 Severity of Adverse Events
The Investigator is to classify the severity of an AE using the  DAIDS Toxicity Table provided in 
Appendix I . If the toxicity table does not p rovide severity guidelines fo r certain events, the following 
definitions will be used:
Table 2 :Guidelines for Grading AE Severity
Severity Characteristic
Mild: Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual soc ial & 
functional activities
Moderate: Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference wit h usual social & 
functional activities
Severe: Symptoms causing inabilit y to perform usual social & fun ctional activities
Potentially Life-
ThreateningSymptoms causing inability to perform basic self-care functions  O R  
Medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent  
impairment, persistent disability, or death
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 7.[ADDRESS_666975] will note an end date and a new entry for the SAE should be 
recorded with an onset date equal to the date the event met seri ousness criteria.
7.1.2 Relationship of AE to Study Drug
The following table should be used as a guideline for assigning  the relationship of the adverse event 
to the study drug. 
Table 3:  Guidelines for Grading R elationship of AE to Study Dr ug
Association Definition
None (not related): (1) The existence of a clear alternative exp lanation (e.g., mechanical 
bleeding at surgical site) or (2) non-plausibility, e.g., the su bject is struck 
by [CONTACT_514705][INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after drug 
administration.
Unlikely (remote): A clinical eve nt, including laboratory test a bnormality (if applicable), 
with an improbable time sequence to drug administration and in which 
other drugs, chemicals, or underl ying disease provide plausible  
explanations. 
Related: A clinical event, incl uding laboratory test abnormality  (if applicable), 
occurring in a reasonable time relationship to drug administrat ion and 
which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_113395].  The response to withdrawal of the drug should be cl inically 
plausible.
Adverse events judged as “Unlik ely” or “Related” will be define d as “Adverse Drug Reaction”.
7.2 Serious Adverse Events
Information about all serious adverse events (SAEs) must be col lected and recorded on the SAE 
Report form and faxed or emaile d to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_666976] also be reported within 24 hours as descr ibed above.
(Safety reporting contact i nformation is provided in Appendix A). The site is to follow their local 
regulations related to the reporting of SAEs to their local IRB /REB/IEC.  An SAE is any undesirable 
sign, symptom, or medical condition which:
xIs fatal or life-threatening (i .e., an event wit h an outcome of ‘Death’), or
xRequires or prolongs inp atient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or
xResults in persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity, or
xConstitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect; or
xIs medically significant, as determined by a qualified health p rofessional, may jeopardize the 
subject, and may require medical o r surgical intervention to pr event one of the outcomes listed 
above
xMajor Bleeding Events mu st be reported as SAEs ( See Section 7.1 )
xAny adverse event causing a need for unblinding must be reported a s a serious adverse event
Events notconsidered to be SAEs are: 
xHospi[INVESTIGATOR_514654]-planned , for a pre-existing condition that 
did not worsen; or
xTreatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event notfulfilling any of the definitions of 
serious given above and notresulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].
All on-study deaths, including new fatal adverse events or adve rse events that worsen post-
baseline resulting in death, must be reported as the outcome of a n associated SAE .I f  t h e  c a u s e  
of death is not immediately known the event may be reported ini tially as “Death”, with the actual 
diagnostic event term provide d as follow-up as soon as it is de termined.
Pregnancies are not considered SAEs unless complications result  which meet serious criteria.  
Pregnancy, although not in itself an SAE, must also be reported t o the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_666977] with positive anti-ART-123 antibody results will ha ve SAEs/thrombotic events captured 
beyond Day [ADDRESS_666978]’s 18 month Follow-Up Visit.
Clinical evidence of thrombosis m ay include deep vein thrombosi s (DVT), pulmonary embolism, 
post-thrombotic syndrome, supe rficial thrombophlebitis, stroke,  and myocardial infarction. 
Sites will be informe d when subjects are antibody positive, after  which SAEs and thrombotic events 
occurring after Day 28 be collected and reported.
7.3 Expected Adverse Events
Expected Adverse Events are those that are consistent with the c urrent version of the Investigator 
Brochure, including specificity or severity.
7.4 Expedited Reporting
All serious adverse events meetin g the definition of reportable  will be forwarded to the proper 
governing regulatory authority within the mandated timelines set  forth by [CONTACT_514706].  
Once the safety report has been ge nerated and forwarded to the proper agency, a letter will be written 
and forwarded to the study Investigators.  The Investigators wi ll be instructed to submit this 
notification to their IRB/REB/I EC as soon as possible according  to their local requirements. 
7.5 Assessment of Risk Burden
In acknowledgement of the need to provide added oversight for v ulnerable populations, monitoring 
for the degree of burden and risk, and assessment of the approp riateness of continuation of treatment 
with ART-123/placebo during the dosing period of Days 1-[ADDRESS_666979] of care. Additional ly, because of the inherent risk of 
bleeding with compounds such as ART-123, in addition to the ass essments called for in the protocol 
(Sections 5.6 - 5.10 ) study drug must be discontinue d in instances where a major bl eeding event 
Protocol 3-001 Confidential 28APRIL2017
Version 4.1 Asahi Kasei Pharma America Corporation
Page 62 of 116(defined in Section 7.1 ) is observed. Additional conditions where study drug must be d iscontinued 
are detailed in protocol Section 2.7.[ADDRESS_666980] 
below outlines which study specific laboratory blood draws are for central laboratory draws (using 
the provided central laboratory  kit) and which are for local la boratory draws (using hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514655]).  
To avoid contamination or clotting, all coagulation tests taken for the purposes of this study should 
be obtained from an original art erial stick or venipuncture. If  it is not possible to obtain blood from 
an original stick or venipuncture, blood may be collected from an arterial line in which no Heparin is 
infused. The arterial line will be flushed with NS both prior to  and after the blood draw. No 
coagulation samples can be obtai ned from a Heparin infused or H eparin coated central line. Heparin 
must not be used when flushing an arterial line for this purpos e. The site staff should use proper 
collection technique as described in the Central Laboratory Man ual.  If an original arterial stick or 
venipuncture is then used to avoid clotting, the coagulation tes t tubes should not be the first 
tube of blood filled. Any other blood tests unable to be obtain ed from the original arterial stick 
or venipuncture may be taken from an existing port or line. If a central line is used, exploratory 
laboratory tests should be the last samples to be collected.
7.6.1 Central Laboratory Tests:
The following laboratory assessments will be collected and sent to the central laboratory for analysis:
xSerum Chemistry (Na, K, Cl, Bicarbonate, Glucose, Ca, BUN, Crea tinine, ALT, AST, 
Alkaline Phosphatase and Total bilirubin)

7.7 Physical Examination
Physical examination is performed at the Baseline Visit. The ph ysical will include general 
appearance; HEENT; neck; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; chest; ab domen; lymphatic; musculoskeletal 
and extremities; skin; and neurol ogic examination. Routine phys ical examinations will not be 
recorded after baseline. Any findings on the baseline physical,  that are not attributable to a medical 
condition present prior to obtaining informed consent and meetin g the last inclusion criteria, are to 
be captured either under a medical diagnosis on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF or as a sign or symptom on 
the Adverse Event eCRF if not part of an diagnosis. All changes  in physical examination from the 
time the subject met the last in clusion criteria and signed inf ormed consent must  be documented and 
recorded as an adverse event (e ither under a medical diagnosis o r as a sign or symptom if not part of 
a diagnosis) in the eCRF.
7.7.1 Vital Signs
Vital signs include: 
xBlood Pressure

7.8 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A 12-lead ECG will be performed as outlined in the “Visit Sched ule and Assessments” (beginning 
with Section 5 ) and the table outlining the “Schedule of Events” ( Section 5.19 ).  Subject’s ECGs will 
be read centrally and the final read/interpretation of the ECG will be forwarded to the sites for filing 
in subject source records and doc umentation in subject’s eCRF. Clinically significant changes in the 
ECG findings vs. baseline will be evaluated by [CONTACT_514707] / SAEs 
as applicable. 
[ADDRESS_666981] be app roved by [CONTACT_514708]/IEC, as applicab le, before implementation.  
9 DATA MANAGEMENT 
9.1 Documentation
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will identify each subject  by [CONTACT_18022] (compi[INVESTIGATOR_514657]) and subject's initials (per local  regulatory guidelines). Originals or 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_129299] , and correspondence will be kept  on file at the inves tigational site. 
The data required by [CONTACT_514709]. All s ource data will be 
available to the study monitor who may perform a 100% data chec k (comparison of the data recorded 
in the eCRF with those in the s ource documents).  The source da ta will also be availa ble for an audit 
by [CONTACT_514710] (Food and Drug Administration) and al l applicable regulatory agencies at 
any time.
Protocol 3-[ADDRESS_666982] specific databa se information has been declare d to be complete and accurate the 
database will be locked. Any changes to the database after that  time can only be made with written 
agreement of the Sponsor. 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
P-values will be reported as 2-sided p-values with the decision  criteria discussed in Section 10.1.1
evaluated using these values.  Confidence intervals will be gen erally reported using traditional 95% 
two-sided intervals.  The primary analysis for this study will be conducted on the data up through 
Day 28.  Long-term survival status data will be analyzed once i t becomes available following the 
analysis of the data through Day 28.  
Randomization will utilize permut ed blocks with a [ADDRESS_666983]. For 
sample size and power calculati ons an unstratified Cochran-Mant el-Haenszel (chi-squared) test has 
been used.  A sample size of 800 subjects provides 80% power if the following assumptions are made:
1. 5% two-sided Įlevel

3. [ADDRESS_666984] is 12% (24% vs. 12%) a sample size  of 800 provides greater than 80% 
power when a 0.1% alpha level is used.
These sample size and power calc ulations were performed with Pa ss 2007.
10.1.1 Decision Guidelines
The primary analysis of this Phas e 3 trial is formally based on  a two-category decision guideline.  To 
be specific, the decision guide line for this trial is based on whether the observed two-sided p-value 
associated with comparison of the 28-day survival for the ART-1 23 arm vs. the placebo arm is, 
between 0.05 and 0.001 or less than 0.001.
1. If the two-sided p-value is between 5% and 0.1% then the ART- 123-based regimen will have met 
the generally accepted level of evidence (false positive error rate) required to demonstrate 
efficacy.
2. If the two-sided p-value is less than 0.1% and supporting ana lyses corroborate this finding ART-
123-based regimen will have provided highly  reliable and statis tically strong mortality results in 
a disease with limited treatment options.  A second confirmator y study would then not be required. 
In this [ADDRESS_666985] study an obser ved treatment be nefit of appro ximately 6% is expected to result in 
a two-sided p-value less than 5%  and a difference of approximat ely 9% is expected to result in a two-
sided p-value less than 0.1%. A s ample size of 800 subjects and t hese assumptions also provide 32% 
power for a 0.1% two-sided Įlevel.

10.3.2 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_514659] y pursued unless it would be unethical 
to continue the study based upon the magnitude of benefit obser ved.  In this situation should the 
primary efficacy results surpass an O’Brien-Fleming type boundar y with Lan-DeMets 
implementation based up on a two-sided alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_666988] and so positive it is unethical to continu e the study they may recommend 
termination for efficacy.  
10.3.3 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_514660]/Fut ility
An analysis to rule out clinically meaningful benefit will also  be performed. The goal of these 
analyses is to stop the study if sufficient evidence exists tha t there is not a clinically meaningful 
treatment benefit. The futility analyses will be conducted with  the use of a lower O’Brien-Fleming 
type boundary.  This boundary will be constructed using a one-s ided alpha level of 0.20 and the 
hypothesis: the 28-day mortality rate on ART-123 is reduced by 6%. Should interim analyses be 
performed after the 600 subjects  time-point (75% information) t he DMC will interpret the results of 
the futility calculations in context of the remaining enrollmen t.
10.4 Handling of Missing Data
Missing data will not be imputed f or summarization; summary sta tistics will be reported based upon 
observed data.  
Exception: for testing of the primary endpoint, Day [ADDRESS_666989]’s health was such that it  was unlikely they would be alive at Day 
28.   If so, it will be assumed the subject was dead at Day [ADDRESS_666990] (chi-squared test) of t he primary endpoint  will be conduct ed.

13.[ADDRESS_666998]/Research Ethics Board/ Independe nt Ethics 
Committee
Before implementing this study, the protocol, the proposed info rmed consent form and other 
information to subjects will be reviewed by a properly constitu ted IRB/REB/IEC.  A signed and dated 
statement that the protocol and informed consent have been appr oved by [CONTACT_1201]/REB/IEC will be 
given to the Sponsor before stud y initiation.  The name [CONTACT_514737]/REB/IEC will be supplied to the Sponsor.  Th is committee will approve any 
amendments to the protocol, other than administrative changes.
13.[ADDRESS_666999] is unable to provide consent 
for him/herself, informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_514716], 
which must comply with an individual country’s local laws and et hics committees regulating the 
enrollment of incapacitated adults into clinical trials.
This process must be expedited to ensure that securing an autho rized representative’s consent does 
not lead to delays that may result in increased risk to the sub ject.  Furthermore, at no time will medical 
treatment be delayed to secure aut horized informed consent for study participation .
Therefore, the following will be  applied as long as your local laws allow:
xConsent from a LAR/AR / next of ki n / legally appointed individu al in person;
Protocol 3-001 Confidential 28APRIL2017
Version 4.1 Asahi Kasei Pharma America Corporation
Page 74 of 116xVerbal consent from a LAR / AR / next of kin / legally appointed i ndividual via telephone, 
confirmed by [CONTACT_514717] (at least 2  people from the study 
site are required, one to adminis ter the informed consent and th e second as a witness);
xConsent from a judge or specifical ly appointed lawyer for this purpose– if required by 
[CONTACT_427];
xIn extreme and urgent circumstances when emergent action is requ ired to mitigate the risk 
of death, it is understood that the presumed will of the subjec t will be determined by a 
physician and documen ted based on his/her knowledge of the stud y subject. As 
appropriate, an independent phys ician, who is a qualified medic al doctor with at least one 
year’s experience in intensive care medicine but must be from a nother department and/or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_514661], ma y sign the informed consent f or the subject if the local 
laws, regulations and ethics committees approve this process. I n countries where 
permissible, this independent phy sician may be from the same de partment. The study 
subject must be presented with t he informed consent as soon as it is possible and 
reasonable, and informed consent obtained for continued study p articipation. The 
AR/LAR may act as an agent on the subject’s behalf once they ar e available to provide 
informed consent. 
When consent is obtained by [CONTACT_514718] a LAR / AR / next of kin / au thorized individual, an original 
signature [CONTACT_66975] a t the earliest opportunity.
Subjects enrolled in the study on the basis of consent by a LAR / AR / next of kin / legally appointed 
individual  / independent physi cian will be given the opportuni ty to provide written confirmatory 
consent when and if they become able to do so.  If the subject declines to confirm consent, they will 
be withdrawn from the study at t he point where they decline con sent.
In addition, where local regulatory and/or ethics committees al low, advance consent may be obtained 
prior to study entry in an attempt to obtain personal consent f rom the subject themselves. 
Should a subject who is enrolled in the study on the basis of a dvance consent subsequently become
unable to make medical decisions for him/herself, then the subj ect's legally acceptable next of kin / 
LAR should be informed of the subj ect's participation in the tri al.
The above guidelines apply to all areas of the protocol where I nformed Consent is referenced or 
required.

Major Bleeding Events
A Major Bleeding event is defined as any intracranial hemorrhag e, any life-threatening bleeding, 
any bleeding event classified as  serious by [CONTACT_737] (e. g., resulting in permanent 
morbidity), or any bleeding that required the administration of  at least 1440 mL (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 units) 
of packed red cells over two consecutive days.[ADDRESS_667000]  be collected, documented, and pro mptly reported as SAEs.
Appropriateness of Ini tial Antibiotic Therapy
The Investigator will review all culture data from the time of infection onset to determine whether 
there is a definite identification of a causal organism (i.e., culture from a normally sterile site such 
as blood or pleural fluid), a likely identification of a causal  organism (i.e., culture of suspected 
pathogen from another site with  additional support [e.g., sputu m culture where the sputum had 
< 10 epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] > 25 WBC per field]), or no causative o rganism identified. The 
Investigator will also review initial antibiotic therapy and or g a n i s m  M I C  d a t a ,  t o  d e t e r m i n e  
whether it was appropriate for t he known or suspected causative  organism. Such review may 
include calculations of AUC/MIC  relationships based on doses an d anticipated clearances.
Mechanical Ventilation
Mechanical ventilation is described for the purposes of this pr otocol as any kind of ventilation 
administered via an endotracheal tube or nasotracheal intubatio n. This applies to all modes of 
ventilation (VA, VC and PC). Pr essure Support Ve ntilation (PSV) is permissible. Simple 
administration of supplemental ox ygen is NOT considered to be m echanical ventilation.

Clinical objective evidence of bacterial infection and being tr eated with antimicrobial medication(s):
The evidence of bacterial infection would include but not be li mited to the following:
xPhysical examination findings (i.e., cellulitis or abscesses)
xPositive culture(s) from normally sterile areas**
xGram stain or other fluid/ tissue preparations (i.e., Direct Fluo rescent Antibody, Nucleic Acid 
probes)
xAntigen detection in urine (i.e., Legionella, Streptococcus pneumoniae )
xRadiographic studies
xSurgical pathology specimens
** Note: A positive culture is not required 
Infection is a pathological process caused by [CONTACT_266715] a hos t tissue or a normally sterile fluid or 
body cavity by [CONTACT_514721], 
local tissue injury, and immune response/inhibition or toxin pr oduction.  
Examples of compelling clinical objective evidence of bacterial  infection (temperature and/or WBC may 
be required) include: 
xRadiographic evidence of pneumonia associated with production o f purulent sputum and a positive 
Gram stain or urinary antigen
xRadiographic evidence of perforated abdominal viscus (i.e., air under the diaphragm), except in cases 
of chemical peritonitis
xPresence of white blood cells in a normally sterile body fluid ( e.g., cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_514664])
Examples of cases lacking compel ling clinical objective evidenc e of bacterial infection (temperature and 
WBC may be required):
xBilateral basilar infiltrates without productive sputum and con firmation of bacterial infection with 
Gram stain, or urinary antigen
xUrine sample with some bacteria and no WBC
xUrine sample with a positive leukoesterase test or only a few W BC and no bacteria

Page 86 of [ZIP_CODE].9 Appendix I: Toxicity/Adverse Event Grading Table
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult an d Pediatric Adverse Events (“DAIDS 
AE Grading Table”) is a descriptive terminology which can be ut ilized for Adverse Event (AE) 
reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each AE t erm.
This clarification of the DAIDS T able for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AE’s provides 
additional explanation of the D AIDS AE Grading Table and clarif ies some of the parameters. 
I. Instructions and Clarifications
Grading Adult and Pediatric AEs
The DAIDS AE Grading Table incl udes parameters for grading both  Adult and Pediatric AEs.  When 
a single set of parameters is not appropriate for grading speci fic types of AEs for both Adult and 
Pediatric populations, separate s ets of parameters for Adult an d/or Pediatric populations (with 
specified respective age ranges) are given in the Table.  If th ere is no distinction in the Table between 
Adult and Pediatric values for a type of AE, then the single se t of parameters listed is to be used for 
grading the severity of both Adul t and Pediatric e vents of that  type.  
Note: In the classification of adve rse events, the term “severe ” is not the same as “serious.” 
Severity is an indication of the i ntensity of a specific event ( as in mild, moderate, or severe 
chest pain).  The term “serious” relates to a participant/event outcome or action criteria,
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a particip ant’s life or functioning. 
Addenda 1-[ADDRESS_667001], male genital area 
or rectum, strong consideration should be given to using Append ices I-III as the primary grading 
scales for these areas. The prot ocol would need to specifically  state that one or more of the 
Appendices would be primary (and thus take precedence over the main Grading Table) for items that 
are listed in both the Appendix and the main Grading Table.

Addendum 2 - Male Genital Grading Ta ble for Use in Microbicide S tudies - PDF
Addendum 3 - Rectal Grading Table f or Use in Microbicide Studies  - PDF
Grade 5
For any AE where the outcome is  death, the severity of the AE i s classified as Grade 5. 
Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Table
In order to grade a clinical AE that is not identified in the DA IDS AE grading table, use the 
category “Estimating Severity Grade” located on Page 3.

ADULT AND PEDIATRIC ADVERSE EVENTS
VERSION 1.0, DECEMBER, 2004; CLARIFICATION AUGUST 2009
Page 87 of 116Determining Severity Grade for  Parameters “Between Grades”
If the severity of a clinical AE could fall under either one of  two grades (e.g., the severity of an AE 
could be either Grade 2 or Grade 3), select the higher of the t wo grades for the AE. If a laboratory 
value that is graded as a multiple of the ULN or LLN falls betw een two grades, select the higher of 
the two grades for the AE. For example, Grade [ADDRESS_667002] (which is betwe en the two grades), the severity of 
this AE would be Grade 2, the  higher of the two grades.
Values Below Grade [ADDRESS_667003].
For example: Phosphate, Serum, L ow, Adult and Pediatric > 14 ye ars (Page 20) Grade 1 range is 
2.50 mg/dL - < LLN. A particular l aboratory’s normal range for Ph osphate is 2.1–3.8 mg/dL. A 
participant’s actual laboratory value is 2.5.   In this case, th e value of 2.[ADDRESS_667004] for the 
local lab, but will be graded as Gr ade 1 per DAIDS AE Grading T able.

Conversions for PaO2/FiO2 whe n the altitude is greater than 100 0m :
1) If your center uses Pb (Pb=barometric pressure in mmHg): Plac e the barometric pressure at 
your altitude into the equation P aO2/FiO2 x (Pb / 760 mm Hg)
2) If your center uses kPa: Place the atmospheric pressure at your  altitude, into this equation 
PaO2/FiO2 x kPa/100 kPa.

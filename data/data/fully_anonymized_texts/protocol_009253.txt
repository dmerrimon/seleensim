1. STUDY OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS  
Primary Objective(s)  
Primary aim: Compare the diagnostic yield of Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) 
with Small -Bowel Capsule Endoscopy (SBCE) in pediatric patients with known 
Capsule Endoscopy  
IRB # 13080263  
Rev 01.31.2017   Page 3 of 15 
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) including Crohn’s disease (CD) or indeterminate 
colitis (IC).  
Secondary Objective(s)  
  
1. To determine the detection rate of small bowel disease / complications, subjected 
to a strategy of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) – small bowel screening / 
surveillance vs MRE in a pediatric tertiary medical institution.  
2. Compare sensitivity and specificity of both MRE and WCE in identifying patients 
with active vs. inactive CD and IC as d efined by [CONTACT_371094]’s disease 
activity index.  
3. To correlate the fin dings detected on WCE by L ewis score with  Crohn’s disease 
activity index.  
2. BACKGROUND  
 
Crohn’s Disease  CD represents a chronic idiopathic disorder primarily involving 
the gastrointestinal tract. Although any part of the gastrointestinal tract can be involved, 
the most common pattern in paediatric patients is ileocecal involvement. More proximal 
small intestin al involvement is more common in pediatric patients with a prevalence of 
up to 20%[1] . The clinical presentation and sequelae of small intestinal involvement in 
Crohn’s Disease is varied and include  nutritional sequelae resulting in growth delay and 
includ ing iron deficiency anemia, stricture formation, obscure abdominal pain and 
eventually obstruction [1,2] . Small intestinal screening in suspected Crohn’s Disease and 
periodic small intestinal surveillance in known cases is the current accepted standard of 
care [1]. There are several modalities that can be employed toward visualizing the small 
intestine although there is no gold standard [1]. Options include contrast studies including 
small bowel series and computed tomography  enterography (CTE). Gadolinium en hanced 
MRI imaging (GAD MRI) of the abdomen and small bowel enema are technically more 
demanding but may be more sensitive in early disease.  
 
There is growing concern with recurrent radiation exposure particularly from 
routine radiol ogic modalities in chi ldren [3 ], this is especially relevant in pediatric 
Crohn’s Disease in so far as CT entercolysis abdomen and small bowel series are often 
seen as complementary [ 3]. Although small bowel series is accepted as a routine 
diagnostic modality in pediatric IBD if fluoroscopy time is kept to a minimum , its 
limitations are well defined and are especially relevant in the early stages of IBD wherein 
fistulising, stricturing disease is less common.  Magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) 
has a diagnostic effectiveness c omparable to other radiological modalities for evaluation 
of adult patients with CD, [1,2] but without radiation exposure. However it is limited by 
[CONTACT_741203], the availability of the requisite equipment and software, need for sedation in 
pediatric population,  limited expertise in accurate interpretation especially in early 
lesions such as are more common in pediatric IBD, and overall insensitivity to early 
mucosal lesions including vascular abnormalities.  
 
Capsule Endoscopy

Rev 01.31.2017   Page 4 of 15 
   Alternative modalities for small bowel imaging are being studied and include the 
routine use of wireless -video capsule endoscopy (WCE) which allows visualization of  the 
small -bowel mucos al lesions in Crohn’s disease [4 ]. Because the risk for capsule 
retent ion in suspected or established Crohn’s disease is significantly increased; in some 
series up to 13%; pre WCE  small bowel imaging or patency capsule has become standard 
of care .  
 
The main indications for WCE in Crohn’s disease are to establish the diagnos is, to 
assess disease prognosis, disease activity, and mucosal healing post therapy, and to define 
the e xtent and severity of disease [5]. A small, prospective study of [ADDRESS_1013375] Crohn’s disease, revealed a sensitivity of 93% and specif icity of 84% for the 
WCE examination compared to surgical and enteroscopic tissue samples , and 
demonstrated a significant change in their management  [6]. Another prospective 
randomized blinded s tudy adults (N = 21) reported  the sensitivity and specificity of CD 
in terminal ileum were 100% and 91% by [CONTACT_741204] [7]. Jenson suggested WCE as first line 
modality for detection of small bowel CD beyond the reach of colonoscopy  [7]. In adults 
with known CD,  Karoui et al evaluated WCE in a prospective study (N = 20) compar ing 
it to radiological techniques and concluded that WCE is more accurate in detection of 
small bowel lesions in CD[ 8]. 
 
In a small retrospective study ( N=7), most older children and adolescents with 
unexplained growth failure and normal small bowel series were found to have Crohn’s 
disease involving the small intestine  [9]. A recent prospective study performed in 60 
pediatric patients  with suspected crohns  showed both MRE and WCE appeared 
complementary  methods for  the detection of Crohn’s disease in suspected CD  patients . 
Both have a high degree of  accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity at 98.3%, 100%, 97.6%, 
and 91.9%, 90.9%, 92.3%, respectively  [10].  Another  large prospective study in  children 
(N=117) with established or suspected CD demonstrate a statically significant diagnostic 
yield of WCE in reclassifying indeterminate colitis IC into CD (60%), detection of CD 
lesions in known CD (41%) and establishing new diagnosis in suspected CD(50%)  
compared to other radiological modalities[11].  
 
Overall tolerance and safety:  WCE is safe in children approximately 9 years of 
age and older, endoscopic placement is feasible in individuals refusing or unable to 
swallow the capsule  but adds to the potential morbidity and expense of the procedure . 
WCE has been safely  performed in ch ildren as small as 11.5 kg [ 4]. Jensen and 
colleagues  studied the factors associated with incomplete WCE studies and their 
diagnostic yield in pediatric patients. In this study, 22% of the WCE studies were 
incomplete, and in 12 (44%) of these were normal p re-WCE radiologic findings  [4].   
 
WCE should be used with caution  and most likely contraindicated  in patients with 
known swallowing disorders, gastrointestinal obstruction and fistulas. The risk for WCE 
retention (which is defined as capsule remains in di gestive tract for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1013376] intervention to aid in its passage) in Crohn’s disease patients is 
estimated to be 5% –13% [12]. Even though Crohns disease is reported to have the most 
Capsule Endoscopy  
IRB # 13080263  
Rev 01.31.2017   Page 5 of 15 
 common retention rate it is reported in met analysis that retention rate is 2.6% in all 
prospective and retrospective studies  [13]. 
 
Atay and colleagues  investigated the risk factors for capsule retention in their 
cohort (n = 207) of pediatric patients studied by [CONTACT_741204] [14]. Capsule retention complicat ed 
1.4% of studies; all in known Crohn’s patients. The risk in known CD patients was 
therefore 5.2%, and rose to 37% if there had been a prior small bowel series showing 
small bowel disease, and to 43% if the patient’s body mass index was less than the 5th  
percentile, presumably indicative of more severe, longstanding small bowel involvement  
[14]. 
The Patency Capsule (Agile ®) was developed, tested, and shown to greatly 
curtail the possibility of small bowel capsule retention and therefore obviate the need for 
surgery[15].  A pre -WCE, patency capsule (PC) strategy has completely removed the 
incidence of capsule retention[15]. The caveat to PC testing is that it also impacts the 
utility of WCE overall in so far as a proportion of patients cannot thus be studi ed (failed 
PC passage).  The Patency capsule is identical in shape and size to the actual WCE 
device but in the presence of small intestinal enzymes  it will dissolve starting at [ADDRESS_1013377] ingestion, thus slow passage or retention  of PC  in the small bow el signal s a risk of 
capsule retention and are usually interpreted as a contraindication for WCE. [16]  
 
The safety of PC was evaluated in a multicenter clinical trial  (N=106)  with known 
Crohn’s disease and intestinal strictures which showed that all cases had a complete 
passage of WCE if patency capsule proved patency [15] . Adverse events of PC were 
reported in 17/106 patients such as abdominal pain was managed with 
conservative management. One case developed obstruction and underwent surgery 
which seems un related to the patency capsule because it was not retained at the 
time of surgery (1/106)  [15]. Another retrospective study by [CONTACT_741205] [ADDRESS_1013378] 
WCE  after one week  with one patient experiencing  capsule ret ention[17] . The results 
of the study led to the diagnosis of CD and the patient subsequently underwent a needed 
ileocecal resection [ 17]. 
 
RATIONALE  
Most of the studies evaluating the roles of MRE and WCE conducted in pedia tric 
patients have been retrospective with the main goal of making a diagnosis in patients with 
suspected IBD. The current study is the first prospective study in children with known 
IBD  assessing the roles of MRE and WCE in identifying disease exacerbati on. This 
study will help to identify if capsule endoscopy is superior or complementary to MRE in 
the evaluation of suspected disease exacerbation in IBD patients . 
 
3.  STUDY DESIGN  
• Prospective single blinded comparison of a cohort of pediatric patients with 
indeterminate colitis (IC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are scheduled to undergo 
Capsule Endoscopy

Rev 01.31.2017   Page 6 of 15 
 routine small bowel screening or surveillance using MRE. Subjects will swallow a  
patency capsule (PC) to study  bowel patency.  If MRE shows stenosis or stricture 
subject and caregivers will be given the opportunity to continue with the study or 
withdraw.  Those patients, who pass an intact PC, usually within [ADDRESS_1013379] the wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE). The WCE will b e performed 
within [ADDRESS_1013380] Crohn’s disease lesions/complications and correlate the 
findings with Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI).  
4. TARGET STUDY POPLUATION SPE CIFICS  
 
Study participants (n= 50) ages 4 – 17.99 years of age will be recruited for this 
study.  Patients will be identified for recruitment  after an initial evaluation  in

Rev 01.31.2017   Page 7 of 15 
 • Standard of Care MRE visit :  
o At the  MRE procedure visit, if not previously consented, the subject and 
family will be approached by a member of the study team to explain the study 
and ask if  they woul d like to participate . If a subject is unable to stay after 
MRE to complete patency capsule procedures , the family  can choose to  return 
in the next 1 -2 days to  any CMH GI location with study staff to  complete the 
procedure.  
• Post Consent:  
o Subject will have  lab draw for: Hemoglobin/Hematocrit (Hgb/Hct), 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Albumin . 
▪ Lab draw at time of standard of care IV placement for MRE if possible  
▪ If not possible to complete at MRE subject may have at the time of    
      patency capsule  or WCE visit.  
▪ If the subject has had these labs drawn for standard of care in the last [ADDRESS_1013381] of this lab draw  
o  Patency capsule (performed as a part of the research study): A dissolvable 
capsule the same size as the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_741197], with a radio frequency 
identification (RFID) tag (size 3mm x 13mm) packed in a lactose and barium 
powder. If the capsule is retained  more than [ADDRESS_1013382] will swa llow the capsule. They will then follow the below schedule.

2 doses (34 grams), 5 -10 years of age 3 doses (51 grams), greater 
than 10 years of age 4 doses (68 grams).  
▪ Due to the age range of subjects in the study they will likely be in school 
during the time they are enrolled in the study. To allow for greater 
flexibility for families. The paten cy capsule can be swallowed at home or  
 
with a parent/caregiver at school during the lunch period. The patient or 
caregiver must record the exact time the pi[INVESTIGATOR_741198] # [ADDRESS_1013383] will receive Miralax and instructions for WCE home prep.  
• Post Patency Capsule Swallow  
o A follow up phone call  will take place with the subject and family the day 
following patency capsule ingestion. Subjects will return to CM radiology for 
an abdominal x -ray within [ADDRESS_1013384] so they are identified as being 
able to participate in these study procedures.  
• WCE Visit  
o The subject will return to the GI clinic to complete the WCE 5 days (± 2 
days) from  the time of patency capsule ingestion . Subject dietary restrictions 
the day before the wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) visit.  
▪ To allow for greater flexibility for those subjects who are in school at the 
time of study procedures. The miralax prep may be started after school 
however the no solid foods after noon must still be observed.  
▪ Subject will fast for 8 hours overnight.  
 
o WCE visit (approx imately  1 hour) - performed as a part of the research study.  
 
▪ The WCE used in this study is the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_741199] c apsule (Given  
      Imaging, Israel) that measures 11mm × 26mm and weighs less than 4 g.  
▪ Subjects will wear a belt sensor around their waist and a recording  device     
attached to it for the duration of the WCE study.  device

 ▪ Subject will be asked questions about any symptoms and/or new      
      medications.  
▪ Subject will swallow the capsule in GI procedure room.  
▪ Subjects should not be around electromagnetic fields while WCE 
procedure is performed  
▪ Subject may drink clear liquids 3 hours after ingesting the capsule  
▪ Subject may eat solid foods 6 hours after ingesting the capsule, 
respectively.  
▪ Subjects will be asked to return to the GI procedure room to return the belt 
sensor 8 -12 hours after ingesting the WCE  
At times due t o Crohn’s disease a portion of the bowel can become inflamed and 
narrowed. These stenosed/strictured areas are not often easily identified until a patient 
has symptoms of bowel obstruction. It is possible that the capsule may identify these 
areas because i t is not able to pass through the decreased space in the lumen. If the family 
or subject does not visually see the capsule pass within [ADDRESS_1013385]’s primary GI physician about 
the finding and medical management will be attempted to reduce the subject’s 
inflammation so that the capsule may pass through. In some cases the capsule may 
identify such a diseased portion of the bowel that it needs to be surgically removed. This 
capsule retention due to a strictured portion of the bowel will not be considered an 
adverse event. It will be considered an incidental finding of the subject’s disease process. 
The subject and their 3rd party payor will be responsible for the treatment of these 
incidental findings.  
6. DATA COLLECTION  
 
Data Collection Procedures  
• The subject’s medical record will be reviewed for data collection to include but 
not limited to, subject demographics, medical and surgical history, imaging 
results initial disease presentation and patient current clinical status. Data will be 
collected on a separate paper data collection form.  
• The capsule images will be independently interpreted by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_741200] [ADDRESS_1013386]’s medical record as they 
would be for standard of care in compliance with the CMH policy on medi cal 
record documentation of research subjects. The subjects regular GI provider will 
review the results of the WCE and consider the results when making decisions 
about the subjects treatment plan. We will be using the capsule endoscopy data 
collection form  including the Lewis scoring system that is automatically 
Capsule Endoscopy  
IRB # 13080263  
Rev 01.31.2017   Page 10 of 15 
 calculated and included in the RAPID® software. Lewis score is a WCE ranking 
of inflammatory activity into three levels based on erythema, stenosis, edema and 
erosions in small intestinal tertiles: 1) no disease or clinically insignificant disease 
(LS<135); 2) mild disease (135≤LS≤790); and 3) moderate or severe disease 
(LS>790) . 
• The study will be considered negative if no abnormalities were seen and as 
positive if clear abnormalities of the SB mucos a (i.e. ulcerations, erosions, polyps, 
vascular lesions, and bleeding lesions) were observed. White lesions within a 
crater with surrounding erythema were considered ulcers, whereas small 
superficial white lesions, even with surrounding erythema, were cons idered 
erosions.  If no abnormalities or non -specific findings (such as erythematous spots 
or mucosal breaks) were seen the examination was considered non -specific or 
normal.  
• The examiners of WCE and MRE will be blinded to each other’s findings but will 
be aware of the patient’s history and laboratory data.  
• To reduce variation in MRE readings, one radiologist will retrospectively review 
the MRE for all subjects to provide a consistent assessment of the extent of the 
subjects’ disease.  
 Records to be kept  
Information will be collected on a paper data collection sheet and entered in an electronic 
database. Additionally if a research team member chooses they may complete the data 
collection form electronically by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_741201]. D ata collection 
forms will be identified only by [CONTACT_741206] , date of service  and will be 
retained indefinitely. The electronic database will only retain assigned  subject study ID 
numbers and will be retained indefinitely. An electronic master subject list will include 
subject name, MRN, dates of service and study assigned ID number. The electronic 
master subject list will be retained indefinitely. A pre -recruitmen t log with patient name, 
MRN and date of MRE will be used to track and keep record of those subjects 
approached for study participation. The pre -recruitment log will be destroyed at the time 
enrollment is completed.  The WCE procedure uses a software instal led on the hard drive 
of the password protected CMH GI procedure room computer. The images from the study 
and subject name, MRN, and date of birth will be retained indefinitely on the hard drive. 
The information entered into the medical record will be reta ined indefinitely.

Measures  
 
1. Detection rate of upper intestinal lesions in known IBD – CD undergoing WCE vs 
radiologic modality.  
2. Definitive diagnosis of S B involvement of patients undergoing WCE vs 
radiologic modality in indeterminate IBD.  
3. Complication rate for WCE vs 1st radiologic testing  
4. Retention rate of WCE  
5. The Crohn’s disease activity index and it is relation with the findings on both 
modalities  
6. Lewis  score on WCE  
 
 
Sample size determination  
 
With a sample size of [ADDRESS_1013387] 80% power probability to 
detect the 23 % difference in IBD small intestinal MRE findings and WCE detection rate 
similar to previously reported pediatric studies  [11]. This determination  uses a Chi -
Square test and a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  Subjects whose MRE results show 
findings that are contraindicated with WCE will be considered screen failures. We 
anticipate around 20% screen failure rate and inten d to recruit 40 subjects to obtain a 
sample size of 34 evaluable subjects.  
   
 
Data Analyses  
 
The disease activity detection rate of MRE and WCE will be compared using McNemar’s 
test and Chi square test. The sensitivity and specificity of both tests will b e calculated 
based on a gold standard of classifying disease activity using Crohn ’s disease activity 
index (CDAI). The person correlation coefficient or spearman rank correlation coefficient

We request a partial Waiver of HIPAA Authorization for pre -recruitment activities.  
 
Potential participants will be identified at the time of a clinic appointment or prior to thei r 
scheduled MRE appointment in radiology. IBD program coordinators or GI providers 
will notify a research staff member of a potential participant’s eligibility. The family will 
be approached at a clinic visit about participation. If the research staff is n otified at a time 
that the family is not in the clinic a member of the study team will call the family to 
introduce the study to them briefly and ask if they can talk with them about the study 
prior to their MRE . A recruitment flyer and permission assent f orm can be sent to the 
family prior to the appointment via e -mail, fax or postal mail should they request it. The 
recruitment flyer will also be made available in the GI Clinic.  
 
Prior to drawing any blood or performing any other procedures related to this  study, the

1.0 PROTOCOL SUMM ARY AND SCHEMA 
 
This  is  a  study  utilizing  the  hypoxia  tracer  fluorine-18-labeled  fluoro-misonidazole  (18F- 
FMISO) to evaluate the presence and bio-distribution of tumor hypoxia in head and neck 
cancer patients.  Two cohorts of patients will be accrued to this protocol: 
 
• Cohort [ADDRESS_1277181]  of 100  patients with Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_909663]  (HPV+) 
tumors and 50 patients with Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_909664]  (HPV-) tumors. 
 
 
• Cohort  [ADDRESS_1277182] of care. 
 
When  possible,  we  will  also  obtain  multi-parametric  magnetic  resonance  (MR)  scans 
consisting   of   conventional   anatomical   MR   imaging   (e.g.   T1-   and   T2-weighted), 
diffusion-weighted   MR  imaging  (DW-MRI),   and  dynamic  contrast  enhanced  magnetic 
resonance  imaging  (DCE-MRI).  These  MR  scans  will be  utilized  to  assess  changes  in 
MR intensities and  the perfusion and  diffusion of water molecules in tumo r and irradiated 
normal  structures  during  and  after  the  course  of  fractionated  external  beam  radiation 
therapy  (RT).  The  DCE-MRI  data  will provide  insight  into  the  tumor  pathophysiology. 
With  proper  compartmental  modeling,  the  DCE-MRI  data  will  yield  results  on  tumor- 
vessel  permeability,  tumor  perfusion,  and  extracellular-extravascular  volume  fraction,  i.e. 
data  relating to  the tumor microenvironment.  These results will determine the potential of 
DCE-MRI data as a priori or early markers of tumor response to chemoradiation as well 
as long term disease-free survival after treatment. 
 
This study will further entail the first human study of 18F-FMISO PET image-guided core 
biopsy of neck node(s) in both HPV+ and HPV- head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC; for Cohort 1 patients that consent to this optional biopsy). Additional tissue will 
be collected from patients who will undergo surgical resection of their cancer per standard 
of care (Cohort 2). We will correlate the intensity of the 18F-FMISO PET signal with the 
degree   of  i mmunohistochemical  staining   of  the  following  hypoxia  biomarkers,   among 
others:  HIF-1α,  Lysyl  Oxidase,  and  Ki67  (an  independent  marker  of  tumor 
aggressiveness). 
 
Lastly,  this  study  will evaluate  a  number  of treatment  approaches  to  HPV-related  head 
and neck cancer. The approaches applicable  to Cohort 1 of this study are outlined  below: 
 
1.   Definitive  chemoradiation  without  pretreatment  surgical  resection  in  which  both 
the primary tumor site and the neck nodes receive 70Gy. In patients who exhibit a 
complete nodal response with this treatment,  no further  treatment is necessary. 
2.   Definitive   chemoradiation   without  pretreatment  surgical  resection  in  which  the 
primary site receives 70Gy while the neck nodes receive a lower dose of radiation 
at  60Gy  instead  of 70Gy.  This  definitive  chemoradiation  is  followed  by  a  FDG 
PET/CT scan at 3 months (+/- 4 weeks) post-treatment. In patients who exhibit a

complete nodal response  with this method  of  treatment (as determined  by  [CONTACT_941] 3- 
month post-treatment FDG PET/CT scan), no further treatment  is necessary. 
 
Patients enrolled  on  to  this protocol who  will receive either of the treatments above (i.e. 
those  without  surgical resection  of  their  cancer)  will be  included  in  Cohort  1,  and  will 
continue  with  standard  institutional care in the case of incomplete or no  nodal response. 
The information obtained from the use of 18F-FMISO PET scans in Cohort 1 will be used 
to  guide  these  patients’ treatment on this protocol. HPV+ head and neck cancer patients 
in Cohort 1  that exhibit no  evidence of hypoxia on their baseline 18F-FMISO PET scan 
and HPV+ head and neck cancer patients in Cohort 1 with early resolution of hypoxia on 
their repeat 18F-FMISO PET scan will receive 70Gy to the primary site and 60Gy to the 
neck nodes followed  by  a FDG PET/CT scan and observation. 
 
Cohort [ADDRESS_1277183] HPV+ tumors that demonstrate no evidence of 
hypoxia on a 18F-FMISO PET scan will receive 30Gy to the surgical bed and neck lymph 
nodes concurrent with standard  chemotherapy followed by a [ADDRESS_1277184]  chemoradiation  will be  given.  All other 
patients  in  this  cohort (i.e.  those who  are not in the select HPV+ tumor group  outlined 
above) will receive standard of care treatment following  their surgery. 
 
Please note the  18F-FMISO  PET imaging protocol is exactly the same for all patients on 
this protocol, regardless of cohort. 
 
 
 
Schema: 
 
1.1 Evaluation,  determination  of cohort, and consent. 
 
1.2 Baseline  studies (standard of care) for head and neck cancer. 
 
1.3 Perform a pretreatment FDG PET/CT scan for Cohort 1 patients. 
 
1.4 Perform   a   recommended   pretreatment   multiparametric   MRI   scan   for 
Cohort  1   p atients.   This  scan  will  be  used  to  derive  a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]-by-pi[INVESTIGATOR_909665]   (D),   perfusion   fraction   (f),   and   apparent 
diffusion   coefficient   (ADC)    using   available   software   when   available 
(unless contraindicated;  for main campus only). 
 
1.5 Prior  to  the  injection  of  the  18F-FMISO  radiotracer,  check  the patient’s 
vital signs.

1.6 Perform a pretreatment dynamic 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan.   This scan will 
be  used  to  verify  the  constancy  of the  hypoxic  regions  within  the  gross 
tumor volume  (GTVh). 
 
1.7 A   safety   assessment   will   be   performed:   vital   signs   and   a   toxicity 
assessment  will  be  completed  i mmediately  after  the  scan  session,  and  a 
follow-up  phone  call  to  assess  for  toxicities  will  be  done  on  the  next 
business  day  following  the  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan  (excluding  holidays 
and weekends).

radiation  therapy)  for  patients  deemed  eligible  for  a  repeat  18F-FMISO 
PET/CT  scan.  This  scan  will be  utilized  to  determine  whether there is a 
reduction of the 18F-FMISO-avid or GTVh within  the gross tumor volume. 
 
1.12 A safety assessment will be performed  for patients who received a repeat 
18F-FMISO PET/CT scan: vital signs and a toxicity assessment will be

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
Hypoxia 
 
Hypoxia is a characteristic feature of malignant tumors that has been well established  (1, 
2).    Unlike healthy tissues, many tumors contain a fraction of hypoxic cells, which 
i mmunohistochemical  studies  suggest  consist  of  nests  of cells  of up  to  several hundred 
micrometers in diameter,  located  at poorly perfused locations within the tumor  (3).   It is 
well known that hypoxia renders tumor cells up  to  three times more resistant to  ionizing 
radiation  than  aerobic  cells  (1-3).    In  addition  to  increased  radioresistance,  hypoxia  is 
associated  with  a  more aggressive and  metastatically viable malignant phenotype.    It has 
been shown in several studies to  be  an important determinant of loco -regional control of 
head  and  neck  tumors  (4,  5).    Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  is  a  noninvasive 
imaging  modality  with  the  potential  to  identify  tumor  hypoxia  at  both  global and  local 
levels  through  the  use  of  hypoxia  targeting  molecules.     If  these  hypoxic  regions  are 
identified,   they   may   be   specifically   targeted   with   additional  radiation   and   perhaps 
translate into further  improvement  in local control. 
 
18F-FMISO PET/CT Scan 
 
A  recently  developed  PET  imaging-based  hypoxia  measurement  technique  using  18F- 
FMISO  can  de tect  and  quantify hypoxic regions within a tumor (6).    Misonidazole is a 
hypoxic   cell   radiosensitizer,   which   is   preferentially   and   metabolically   reduced   and 
entrapped within hypoxic cells and not aerobic cells. An 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan is a 
noninvasive  imaging  method  in  detecting  tumor  hypoxia.    In  a  R3327-AT  Dunning  rat 
prostate tumor model at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), microPET 
imaging of 18F-FMISO  has been used  to  detect tumor hypoxia,  followed  by  [CONTACT_909689] [ADDRESS_1277191]  also  been  performed  in  patients  at  numerous 
institutions  (e.g.  Rasey  et  al)  (6).    A  phase  I  trial of using  concurrent  tirapazamine,  a 
hypoxic cell sensitizer,  cisplatin,  and  radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced  head  and

neck cancer has been done at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute in Australia (8 ).   All 
patients underwent 18F-FMISO  PET to  provide evidence of tumor hypoxia.   All patients 
also  had  baseline FDG PET scans and  the scan was co-registered with the 18F-FMISO 
PET.    18F-FMISO PET scans in this study were obtained [ADDRESS_1277192]-injection for 20 head and neck cancer patients (MSKCC 04-070). These 
studies  focused  first  on determining the constancy of 18F-FMISO  PET image sets when 
repeat  scans  were  performed  3  days  apart  (an  essential pre-requisite  for  IMRT  dose 
painting).  Prel i minary  results  demonstrated  that  imaging  of  hypoxic  subvolumes  (GTVh) 
is  feasible  and  that reproducible zones of hypoxic tracer uptake are observed  (7).    We 
also performed a third 18F-FMISO scan on p atients at four weeks into their radiotherapy 
treatment (MSKCC  04-070).  The objective of this third  scan was to  determine whether 
tumor reoxygenation occurred, as indicated by [INVESTIGATOR_8614] 18F-FMISO uptake, or whether hypoxia 
persisted throughout treatment. Our finding from this second clinical study objective, as 
evidenced  by  18 /20  patients  exhibiting  no  18F-FMISO  uptake,  was  that  hypoxia  is  no 
longer  evident  late  into  a  course  of radiotherapy.  Patients  in  this cohort experienced  at 
95%  nodal  control  rate  (9).  The  possibility  of  tumor  reoxygenation  early  during  the 
course  of  fractionated  radiotherapy  cannot  be  overlooked.     Therefore,  in  the  current 
version of this protocol, our goal is to perform a repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan early in 
the  course  of  standard  chemotherapy  and  fractionated  radiotherapy  (5  to  10  treatment 
days) for a series of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients (Cohort 1).   If these 
repeat  scans  also  demonstrate  no  evidence  of residual  18F-FMISO  uptake  early  in the 
course  of  fractionated   radiotherapy,   this  information  will  have  major  implications  for 
hypoxia-guided  fractionated  radiotherapy. 
 
In summary,  hypoxia is a characteristic feature of malignant tumors that can render tumor 
cells  up  to  three  times  more  resistant  to  ionizing radiation than aerobic cells.    With the 
use  of  18F-FMISO  PET,  a  noninvasive  imaging  modality,  hypoxic  subvolumes  (GTVh) 
within  a  tumor  can  be  identified.    If these  hypoxic  regions  are  identified  and  verified, 
they  may  be  specifically  targeted  by  [CONTACT_909690]: 04 -070 A(38)

specific  region. Ultimately,  by  [CONTACT_909691]  a  differential  dose  of  radiation  to  the 
tumor, the local control rates of head and neck cancer patients may further  be improved. 
 
Multipara metric  MRI 
 
MRI   is   a   non-invasive   technique   utilized   to   assess  morphological  and   physiological 
changes in tumor and irradiated normal structures. In this study we will be taking a series 
of  multiparametric  MR  images  around  the  same  time  as  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  that  will 
enable a direct comparison between PET defined hypoxia volume and MR defined tumor 
volume.  The  excellent  soft  tissue  contrast  will aid  in  improved  normal tissue  contouring 
of  salivary  glands  and   lymph  nodes  which  will  ultimately  help  in  further  sparing  of 
normal   structures   during   external   beam   planning.   Si mi lar   i mmobilization   techniques 
employed  during CT simulation and  MR scan will help  in co-registering MR images with 
CT and PET scans, when available. 
 
Radiation of the head  and  neck  can irreversibly damage oral mucosa, vasculature, muscle 
and bone resulting in xerostomia, dental caries, trismus, soft tissue necrosis and 
osteoradionecrosis.  A  change  in  intensity  or  image  texture  over  the  course  of radiation 
obtained  from  these  MR  scans  may  be  an  indication  of  radiation  damage  to  these 
sensitive  structures.   In  addition,   we  hypothesize  that  perfusion  and  diffusion  changes 
observed in tumor and normal structures could be dose dependent. 
 
DW-MRI 
 
DWI-MRI measures differences in tissue microstructures based on the random Brownian 
motion  of  water  molecules  in  biological tissues.  It  quantifies  the degree of restriction of 
water  diffusion  or  tissue  diffusivity  and  has  the  potential  to  differentiate  benign  lesions 
from malignant  tumors.  The  quantitative  measure of water mobility is calculated  in terms 
of apparent  diffusion  coefficient  (ADC)  by  [CONTACT_909692] ‘b’ values. 
Tumors  with  more  densely  packed  tumor  cells  and  more  cell membranes have a lower 
ADC due to greater restriction to diffusion. Non-tumoral tissue changes such as edema, 
inflammation,  fibrosis,  and  necrosis  typi[INVESTIGATOR_909668] 
(28,  29).  In addition  to  molecular diffusion of water in biological tissue,  microcirculation 
of  blood  (or  “perfusion”)  in  the  capi[INVESTIGATOR_909669]  ‘b’ 
values.  DWI-MRI  using  both  low  and  high  b  values  (also  called  intravoxel incoherent 
motion  sequence  or  IVIM)  gives  a  quantitative  measure  of  true  diffusion  (D)  and 
perfusion  fraction  (f) (30) without  the use of an intravenous  contrast agent. 
 
DWI-MRI has been successfully applied  for various disease sites.  Its clinical applications 
in  head   and   neck  cancer  have  been  in  differentiating  malignant  tumors  from  benign 
lesions (31,  3 2),  characterizing and  staging of lymph nodes in the head  and  neck  region 
(33) and monitoring tumor response (34, 35, 36, 37). A few studies have investigated the 
salivary  gland  response  based  on  changes  in  ADC  value  (38,  39).  Malignant  tumors 
usually  show  low  ADC  values  compared  to  benign  tumors.  A  mean  cut-off  value  of 
1.2x10-3  for  adult tumors and  1.25 x10-3  for pediatric head  and  neck  tumors has been 
shown   to   distinguish   b etween   malignant   and   benign  tumors   with  87%  and   92.8%

accuracy,   respectively  (5).   Dirix  et  al  have  shown  superior  accuracy  of  DW-MRI 
compared  to  conventional imaging in nodal staging where DW-MRI was shown to agree 
with  pathology  with  a  sensitivity  of  89%  and  specificity  of 97%  per  lymph node (33). 
Changes  in  ADC  value  have  been  shown  to  correlate  significantly  with  2 -year  local 
regional control based  on  multiple MRs taken over the course of chemotherapy (34, 35). 
In  a  chemoradiation  setting,  efficacy  of ADC  was  investigated  for  prediction  and  early 
detection  of  treatment  response.  Changes  in  ADC,  compared  with  pretreatment  value, 
after  the  first week  of  chemoradiation therapy have shown high sensitivity and  specificity 
in separating  complete responders from partial responders (36). 
 
Very few studies have looked at the utility of DWI for normal tissue response. Dirix et al 
and  Zhang et al have looked  at radiation induced  changes in major salivary glands using 
DWI.   ADC  changes  were  inversely  related  to  salivary  flow  measurements  and  may 
represent a sensitive marker of salivary gland dysfunction. Both these studies have shown 
potential  to  predict  radiation-induced  xerostomia.  A  more  recent  study  from our  group 
looked  at  the  efficacy  of  pre-treatment  multimodality  imaging  consisting  of MRS,  DCE- 
MRI and FDG PET (40) in head and neck cancer patients to predict short-term response 
to treatment. We are not aware of any studies that have looked at 18F-FMISO and DW- 
MRI  for  tumor  heterogeneity  in  head  and  neck  cancer  patients.  In  this  study,  when 
possible, we will obtain a MR scan before (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 main campus patients), 
approximately weekly (Cohort 1  main campus patients only),  and post-external beam RT 
at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after external beam RT (+/- 4 weeks; Cohort 1 main 
campus   patients   only),   unless   contraindicated.   We   will  evaluate   changes   in   tumor 
heterogeneity  between  PET  and  MR  scans  as  markers  of tumor  response.  Changes  in 
perfusion  and  diffusion  fraction  for  normal  structures  from  serial  MR  scans  over  the 
course of radiation therapy will enable us to  evaluate markers of radiation-induced  acute 
and long term toxicities. 
 
Treatment  for Head and Neck Cancer 
 
Currently,  there are several approaches in the treatment  of head and neck cancer. 
 
1.   Definitive  chemoradiation  where  both  the primary tumor site and  the neck  nodes 
receive  70Gy.    In patients in whom a complete nodal response is achieved  with 
this treatment,  no further treatment  such as neck dissection  is needed. 
 
2.   Definitive  chemoradiation  where  the  primary  site  receives  70Gy  while  the  neck 
nodes receive a lower dose of radiation at 60Gy instead of 70Gy. This treatment is 
then followed  by a  FDG PET/CT scan and continued  observation. 
 
3.   Surgical resection  of the  tumor.  Following  this surgery,  patients may or may not 
undergo   adjuvant   radiation   with   or   without   concurrent   chemotherapy.   The 
utilization  of  radiation  and/or  chemotherapy  following  surgical resection  is 
dependent  on  the  staging  and  pathologic  features  of the  disease/resected  tissue, 
among other risk factors.

Although a high loco-regional control rate of >90%  is seen for oropharyngeal carcinoma 
treated  with  chemoradiation,  patients  still  experience  significant  acute  and  late  toxicities 
(13,    45 ).    These   toxicities   are   particularly   concerning   considering   the   increasing 
prevalence  of HPV-associated  head  and  neck  carcinoma  (42),  particularly  those  of the 
base of tongue and  tonsillar sites (both anatomical sites of the oropharynx) in individuals 
ages  20-44  in  the  United  States  (46).  This  latter  statistic  will ultimately  coincide  with 
longer-lasting   long-term   morbidities   associated   with   OPSCC-targeted   chemoradiation, 
which  may  have  significant  social  and  financial  implications  in  the  future  (45)  and  an 
adverse effect on the long-term quality  of  life of patients who undergo this treatment. 
 
Given   the   recent   rise   in   HPV-related   oropharyngeal   carcinoma   and   the   toxicities 
associated  with  the  standard  treatment  course  for  this  disease,  an  investigation  into  the 
efficacy and safety of treatment de-escalation to reduce the morbidity associated with the 
treatment  of this  disease is warranted.  This is particularly true for the cohort of patients 
who  present with HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma, as these patients are more likely 
to  be  younger  and  healthier  than  those  presenting  with non-HPV-related  disease.  When 
making  the  determination  of  which  patients  should  undergo  a  less  intense  treatment 
regiment,  it  is  important  to  make  an  evidence-guided  selection.  This  cohort should  only 
include patients most likely to: (1) respond efficaciously to treatment reduction, and (2) 
maximally    benefit    from    a    decrease    in    treatment-related    toxicities.    Otherwise, 
unwarranted  tumor recurrences  may result. 
 
A  number  of  investigations  have  established  that  the  prognosis  of patients  with  HPV- 
related oropharyngeal carcinoma is superior to that of patients with non-HPV-related 
oropharyngeal  carcinoma  (41,  44,  and  47).  In  addition  to  HPV  status  serving  as  a 
mediator of overall prognosis and  treatment response,  it is well known that the presence 
of hypoxia renders tumor cells up  to  three times more resistant to  ionizing radiation than 
aerobic cells (1-3).    Hypoxia is also associated with a more aggressive and metastatically 
viable malignant phenotype, and has been shown in several studies to be an important 
determinant  of loco-regional control of head and neck tumors (4, 5). 
 
At  our  institution,  we have an active hypoxia imaging protocol,  MSKCC  IRB#  04-070, 
for all head and neck tumors regardless of HPV status. The first 20 head and neck cancer 
patients that were enrolled in this protocol were all treated with 70Gy to both the primary 
site and the neck nodes.   An exceptionally high locoregional control rate of 95% was seen 
with  a  nodal control rate  of 95%  as  well (9).    Furthermore,  all but  two  patients  had 
resolution  of  their baseline hypoxia  on repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT imaging. 
 
When considering the evidence regarding HPV status and the effects of hypoxia on tumor 
response, it can be inferred that oropharyngeal carcinoma patients with the most superior 
prognosis  are  those  who  meet  the  following  criteria:  HPV-related  and  no  evidence  of 
hypoxia. Therefore, given: (1) the rise in HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinoma, (2) the 
significance  and  burden  of  oropharyngeal carcinoma  treatment-related  toxicities,  and  (3) 
in-house  data  where  hypoxia  response  correlated  with  high  loco-regional  control,  the 
current  version  of  this  protocol  seeks  the  following  for  select  patients  in  Cohort  1 
(patients receiving  chemoradiation  without  surgical resection):

A. to give HPV+ oropharyngeal carcinoma patients who demonstrate no evidence of 
hypoxia  on  a  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan  the  option  of  an  alternative  standard 
approach to  the treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma  through delivering 60Gy to 
the neck  nodes followed  by  a  FDG PET/CT scan.   The primary site will receive 
70Gy,    and    these    patients   will   undergo    standard    chemotherapy   regimens. 
Delivering  60Gy  to  the  neck  nodes  followed  by  a  FDG  PET/CT  scan  and 
continued  observation  does  not  deviate  from one  current  standard  of care,  and 
allows for the ability to deliver a lower dose of radiation to the neck with the goal 
of    mini mizing    radiation    toxicities     while     ensuring    that    no    unwarranted 
compromise   to   the   already   excellent   loco-regional  control  in  this  population 
occurs.  All the imaging  studies  will be done exactly per protocol. 
 
Si mi lar  to  oropharyngeal  cancer,  rates  of  the  oncogenic  HPV-[ADDRESS_1277193]  been 
demonstrated  to be present in as many as 79% of HPV-related anal carcinoma  cases (53). 
In  the  early  1970s,   investigators  at  Wayne  State  University  demonstrated  that  anal 
carcinoma  (Nigro  Protocol)  could  effectively  be treated  preoperatively with a concurrent 
course of chemotherapy with 30Gy (56). Results demonstrated 84% of patients to be free 
of cancer  following  treatment  per  the  Nigro  Protocol,  suggesting  30 Gy could  effectively 
treat   carcinomas   when   administered   concurrently  with  chemotherapy.   Furthermore,   a 
79%   five-year   overall  survival  rate   was   demonstrated   (48).   When  utilizing  salvage 
therapy  in  the  setting  of  treatment  failure  with  the  Nigro  Protocol,  rates  of successful 
treatment response, as defined by [CONTACT_909693] a mean of 34-months follow- 
up, have been documented  to be as high as 95% (49). 
 
When utilizing a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy for HPV-related 
oropharyngeal cancers  today,  a  number  of cancer  treatment centers often omit  radiation 
to  the  primary  disease  site in low-risk  patients whose surgical margin is negative.  When 
taking  this  into   consideration  with  the  evidence  of  HPV  status  on  tumor  response, 
hypoxia on tumor response, and the work that has been done in anal carcinoma, it can be 
inferred   that   low-risk   HPV+   oropharyngeal  carcinoma   patients   treated   initially   with 
surgical  resection  of  their  primary  disease  site  may  optimally  respond  to  30Gy  with 
concurrent   standard   chemotherapy.   The   current   version   of  this   protocol  seeks  the 
following  for  select  patients  in  Cohort  2  (patients  receiving  surgical  resection  of  their 
cancer): 
 
B.  to   give   a   select   HPV+   tumors   an   alternative   treatment   for   oropharyngeal 
carcinoma. This select cohort will be comprised of patients who meet all of the 
following  criteria: 
 
1.   resection of their primary  tumor site 
2.   low-risk HPV-related oropharyngeal  carcinoma

disease  at  the  time  of  this  neck  dissection,  additional  chemoradiation  will  be 
given. 
 
Please note that initially  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_909670] 35 patients and after a 
meeting  requested by [CONTACT_909694] [INVESTIGATOR_909671]'s, and with the advice from 
the IRB, it was decided to close the trial at patient 19 and write a new trial for 
cohort B.  This new trial is MSKCC IRB 17-409. 
 
 
 
Immuno histoc he mistry 
 
Several  studies  examined  the  relationship  between  p16  expression  by  [CONTACT_909695]-time  PCR  and  found  great  correlation.     These  studies  all 
uniformly showed  that either  is a good  p rognostic marker for treatment outcome. RTOG 
0129  was a large  randomized  controlled clinical trial that was recently published for head 
and neck cancer of which there was a large tissue sample size that examined the relative 
strength of HPV DNA using in situ hybridization vis-a-vis p16 IHC as a prognostic 
marker  (13).  The  study  also  showed  that  there  was  a  very  strong  agreement 
between the presence of HPV DNA and p16 expression in head and neck tumors. 
Results of analyses using p16 expression as a stratification factor were consistent 
with those based on HPV status.   Given p16 expression measured by [CONTACT_61847] a 
relatively simple procedure, we will stratify patients based on p16 status.  This is 
also convenient for the patients as we will not have the need to subject the patients 
to further biopsy for HPV DNA analysis. 
 
One important  characteristic  of tumor development  is angiogenesis.   Induced by 
[CONTACT_68413],  the tumor cells secrete a variety  of cytokines and growth factors that induce 
proliferation  (evidenced  by o verexpression  of Ki-67), migration,  and blood vessel 
formation  (23-25).  Ki-67 is one known prognostic marker in head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma  (HNSCC) and is inversely  related to the presence of hypoxia.  The 
rationale  is  that  a  stronger  and  more  widespread  Ki-[ADDRESS_1277195] that high  Ki- 
67 staining  should be accompanied  by [CONTACT_909696] 18F-FMISO image intensity  and vice 
versa. 
 
Cellular  response to hypoxia  is regulated  primarily  through  the transcriptional factor, 
hypoxia-inducible  factor (HIF-1α), which is the central mediator of the angiogenic 
response in hypoxia.  Studies have shown that the dysregulation  of  HIF -1α may play a 
role  in  the  malignant  progression  of  HNSCC  (24,  25 ). Overexpression of HIF-1α has 
been  reported as an independent  prognostic  factor in HNSCC and is associated with poor 
prognosis as well as locally  aggressive  behavior of HNSCC. In one series where a cohort 
of 98 patients  were treated with curative  radiation  therapy for their oropharyngea l cancer,

94% showed overexpression  of  HIF-1α as determined  by [CONTACT_4658] (24). The degree of HIF-1α 
correlated inversely  with both the rate of complete remission  of the primary  tumor as well 
as the lymph  node metastases; local failure-free  survival,  disease-free survival,  and 
overall survival.  They concluded  that HIF-1α is overexpressed in the vast majority  of 
oropharyngeal cancer and that the degree of expression has prognostic significance  in 
individuals  undergoing  curative  radiotherapy.  In addition,  studies on gene expression 
have shown hypoxia  induces metastasis- mediated  genes.  The overexpression  of the 
recently  identified  lysyl oxidase (LOX) as a hypoxia  and HIF-1α regulated  gene was 
strongly  associated  with  increased  metastasis,  progression  and  OS  (26,  27 ).    LOX has 
been implicated  as a marker for metastasis  and OS for HNSCC. 
 
This  is the first human study that that uses a non-invasive imaging technique for hypoxia 
(18F-FMISO  PET/CT)  for  the  purposes  of  i mmunohistochemistry  (IHC)  correlation  for 
tissue  markers  of hypoxia.  To  date,  nearly [ADDRESS_1277196]  biopsied  areas  that  demonstrated  high 
18F-FMISO  uptake on the  18F-FMISO PET/CT scan. However, initial results from these 
biopsies  have  demonstrated  that  nearly  50%  of these  specimens  did  not  contain  tumor 
cells,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_909672]  18F-FMISO  avid  regions.  Only 
stromal,  fibrous,  and  lymphoid  tissues were able to  be  identified.    In order to overcome 
the sampling error associated  with small needle biopsy,  we will obtain more tumor tissue 
without  deviating  from current standards of care for head  and  neck  cancer.    Given that 
one current standard  in the treatment of loco-regionally advanced oropharyngeal cancer is 
surgical  resection  using  the  robotic  surgery  technique,  we  plan  to  utilize  the  surgical 
specimens  of  these  patients  for  our  IHC  hypoxia  studies.  Furthermore,  we  will image 
these   patients   with   an   18F-FMISO   PET/CT  scan  prior  to   their  standard   of  care 
pretreatment   surgical  resection  in  order  to   correlate  hypoxia  on  imaging  with  IHC 
performed  on  their  surgical specimen.  The  surgeons  performing  these  surgical resections 
will  be  asked  to  orient  their  surgical specimen  according  to  the  18F-FMISO  PET/CT. 
Patients undergoing this standard  of  care surgical resection will make up Cohort [ADDRESS_1277197] human study of 18F-FMISO PET image-guided core 
biopsy of neck node(s) in both HPV positive and negative HNSCC (for Cohort 1 patients 
that consent to  this optional biopsy).  Additional tissue will be collected from patients who 
will undergo  surgical resection of their HNSCC per standard of care (Cohort 2). We will 
correlate the intensity of the 18F-FMISO PET signal with the degree of IHC staining of the 
following  hypoxia  biomarkers,   among  others:  HIF-1α,   Lysyl  Oxidase,  and  Ki67  (an 
independent  marker of tumor aggressiveness ).

Rationale  for Change in 18F-FMISO PET/CT Imaging  Protocol 
 
The  prel i minary  18F-FMISO  PET  image  data  acquired  in  patients  with  head  and  neck 
cancers have shown variable hypoxia tracer uptake at the fixed 2.5 hour time p oint used 
in the initial study.    In order to  convert the  18F-FMISO  images to parametric images of 
tumor  hypoxia,  a  group  in  Tübingen,  [LOCATION_013]  has  recently  shown  the  importance  of 
obtaining kinetic information of the tracer in the tumor (14-17) for an unambiguous 
interpretation  of the hypoxia  images. 
 
PET/CT Scan Protocol 
 
Dynamic  scans  will  be   acquired   on  one  of  the  PET/CT  scanners  qualified  by  [CONTACT_909697][INVESTIGATOR_909674].  3-D  mode  and  with  listmode  option  will  be  turned  ON.    The 
listmode  option  allows  the  patient  data  to  be  reconstructed  in a cine mode (in variable 
time frames) so  that pharmacokinetics of tumor uptake of the radiotracer can be studied . 
The patient will be set up  in the radiotherapy treatment position with an intra-venous line 
for  radiotracer  injection.  A  PET/CT  scan  will be  performed  with the tumor at the field 
center.  These  images  will be used  for both attenuation correction and  registration of the 
serial image set. 
 
Approximately 5-10 mCi dose of 18F-FMISO will be injected as a bolus, and the dynamic 
scan initiated  coincident with the injection. Data will be acquired in dynamic mode for up 
to  a maximum of 45  minutes from the time of injection,  but may be shorter  (e.g.  if the 
patient  is  in  discomfort  in  the  i mmobilization  device  for  this  duration).  The  patient  will 
then  be  removed  from the scanner,  and  instructed  to  return at  approximately 90-minutes 
for a second  PET scan and again at approximately180-minutes for a third PET scan. No 
further activity will be injected  in the  patient at these times.  The 2nd  and  3rd  PET scans 
will consist of a 10-minute image of the tumor. A low dose CT scan will be performed at 
each of these two image sessions for attenuation  correction and image registration. 
 
In up  to  [ADDRESS_1277200] IVIM departmental protocol and utilization of the patient’s 
i mmobilization  device  when  the  i mmobilization  d evice  is  available  and  the  patient agrees 
to utilize it. DWI-MR images will also be acquired according to the standard IVIM 
departmental protocol. 
 
At  the  pretreatment  MR  scan  for  Cohort  1  and  Cohort  2  main  campus  patients,  an 
additional scan  will be  acquired  based  on a research sequence provided  by  [CONTACT_191731]  (the

manufacturer  of the  machine on which these MRIs occur)  that will allow visualization of 
cortical  bones  in  the  head  and  neck  region  and  potentially  differentiate  bone  from air 
sinus cavity. This scan will be used to evaluate the potential of using MR alone images to 
differentiate  and  segment  normal  tissues  used  in  radiotherapy  treatment  planning.  This 
additional sequence will add  an extra [ADDRESS_1277201] of care. Additional scans will be acquired 
on  our  Philips  3T  research  scanner.   Images  will  be  sent  to  the  research  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_909675].  These  images  may  be  used  for  contouring  of 
normal  structures   during   the   treatment   planning   process.   DW-MRI   images   will  be 
processed  on  the  Philips  research  platform  and  corresponding  diffusion  and  perfusion 
maps  will  be  analyzed  for  therapy  response  assessment  and  treatment  planning.  Spatial 
changes   during   treatment   will  also   be  evaluated   using  functional  diffusion  maps  or 
parametric response maps. No clinical decision will be made at this point based on MR 
findings. 
 
PET/CT Image-guided  Core Biopsy (Optional – Cohort 1 Patients Only) 
 
The  PET/CT  scan  will be  performed  in  the  Center  for  Image-Guided  Intervention  and 
Surgery at MSKCC, which houses a PET/CT scanner in an interventional radiology and 
operating   room   environment.   The   PET   image-guided   core   biopsy   procedure   will 
conducted as follows: 
 
On  the  day  of  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  imaging,  patients  will  be  injected  with  the  study 
tracer,  18F-FMISO.     After  the  final  18F-FMISO  PET  image  acquisition  at  each  visit 
session  (where  applicable),  biopsy  samples  will be removed  from tumor tissue exhibiting 
high and low 18F-FMISO uptake (if both are available). These high and low 18F-FMISO 
uptake   regions   correspond   to   putative   hypoxic   and   normoxic   regions,   respectively. 
Parametric   image   maps   will   also   be   retrospectively   generated   from  compartmental 
models  that  define  the  rate  of 18F-FMISO  radiotracer entrapment.  These values will be 
used,  in  addition  to  the  percent  injected  dose  per  gram,  for  correlation  with  IHC  of 
hypoxia  specific markers. 
 
The  aforementioned   biopsy  samples   will  be  obtained  by  [CONTACT_909698]  18F-FMISO  PET/CT images.  1% lidocaine will be used 
for local anesthesia supplemented with midazolam and fentanyl citrate for light conscious 
sedation.  The biopsy needle  will be placed  in position to remove core biopsy material of 
the node(s),  and  the patient will have an additional low dose CT to  visualize the biopsy

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1277202]  images  will be  co-registered  using  mutual information  d ensity 
software.     Immediately  following  biopsy,  the  specimen  will  be  properly  oriented  and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_160065].  Based  upon  published  experience,  discussion  with  other  investigators,  and  our 
own experience of obtaining tissue prior and during treatment, we anticipate it will take 
approximately fifteen minutes to  perform each biopsy.  The specimen acquired  from these 
tumor  samples  will be  taken  for  paraffin  embedding,  fresh frozen (if patient consents to 
any  of  optional  banking  studies),  and  histological processing  to  our  Pathology 
Department. Ten 5µm thick sections from p araffin tumor blocks or core samples will be 
deparaffinized  and  rehydrated,  and  stored  at −80 °C  until processing.  IHC  analyses will 
also  be performed  for the following hypoxia relevant biomarkers,  among others: HIF-1α, 
LOX, and Ki-67. 
 
Pretreatment  Surgical Resection (Cohort 2 Patients Only) 
 
The  eligible  patient  will  undergo  a  pre-surgery  FDG  PET  scan  and  an  18F-FMISO 
PET/CT  scan.      Following  these  pre-surgical  scans,   the  patient  will  undergo  his/her 
standard  of  care surgery.   The surgeon will annotate the location of each sample resected 
from  the  lesion  by  a  text  description  for  documentation  of  relative  position.     The 
specimen   will  be  embedded   in  paraffin  in  an  orientation  that  will  allow  sectioning 
parallel to  the  imaging  plane  of the PET/CT image.  Tissue sections will be stained  with 
H&E,   hypoxia  specific,  and  proliferation  markers  using  the  same  procedures  as  the 
described for the biopsy specimens  in this  protocol. 
 
Biospecime n  Samples 
 
Biospecimen  samples  from Cohort  1  (obtained  via  biopsy) and  Cohort 2  (obtained  via 
surgical resection)  will not used  for diagnostic  purpose.  They will instead  be utilized  for 
a research purpose.  They will be labeled with de-identified subject IDs, initials, date and 
time of specimen collection,  and  visit time  point,  which are linked to the identifiable PHI 
and  will  be  kept  confidential.  The  participant’s  personal  identity  willl  not  be  used  in 
reports that are written about the research. The MSKCC IRB/PB will review all requests 
for  research  performed   involving  tissues  ascertained   through  this  protocol.  With  the 
permission   of  IRB/PB,   research  studies  on  cellular,   genetic,   i mmunologic,   or  other 
features  of tumor  or normal samples may be performed  with no  names attached  to  the 
samples  but  linked  by  [CONTACT_909699].  The  results  of any  research  using 
tissues will not be placed in the medical record. 
 
HIF-1α 
 
IHC  staining will be performed  on biospecimen samples  using the antibody against HIF- 
1α  (Novus  Biologicals,  Littleton,  Colorado,  dilution  1 :1600)  utilizing  previously  reported 
techniques.  Briefly,  [ADDRESS_1277203]  Plus  slides,  deparaffinized  with  xylene  and  rehydrated.  Tissue

will be  then avidin/biotin blocked with blocking kit (Vector SP-2001). For HIF-1α, 
DakoCytomation   catalyzed   signal  amplification   system  (Dako,   K1500)  will  be  used 
according to the manufacturer directions. Slides will be counterstained with hematoxylin, 
dehydrated  and  cover-slipped.  Only the nuclear staining for HIF-1α willl  be considered a 
positive  result.  Expression  of  HIF-1a  will be  determined  by  [CONTACT_31576]-quantitatively assessing 
the   percentage   of   marked   tumor   cells   and   the   staining   intensity   to   calculate   an 
i mmunoreactive  score  (IRS).  Therefore,  the  percentage of positive cells will be rated  as 
1–10%  po sitive  cells  (1×),  11–50%  po sitive  (2×),  51–80%  po sitive  (3×),  and  >  80% 
positive cells (4×). The staining intensity will be scored as weak (1×), moderate (2×), and 
intensive (3×). Scores for expression and scores for percentage of positive cells will be 
multiplied  to calculate  an IRS ranging  from 0 to 12. 
 
Lysyl Oxidase 
 
5μm  formalin-fixed   paraffin-embedded   tissues   will  be   deparaffinized   in   xylene,   then 
rehydrated  before antigen retrieval by [CONTACT_909700] (pH 6.0). The 
slides  will then  be  incubated  with a peroxidase block,  followed  by  [CONTACT_909701]    (LOX)    according    to    the    company’s    protocol.    After   hematoxylin 
counterstain,  the  slides  will be  cover  slipped.  Cytoplasmic staining will be  considered  as 
positive.  The  intensity  and  proportion  of  i mmunostaining  will be  scored  on  a 
semiquantitative  six-point  scale.  Negative  samples  will  receive  a  score  of  0,  whereas 
weak,   moderate,   and   intense  staining  samples  will  receive  a  score  of  1,  2,  or  3, 
respectively. For the percentage tumor cell positivity the following scoring will be used: 
negative=0, 1–25%=1, 25–50%=2, >50%=3.   Both the staining intensity and percentage 
positivity  scores  will  be  summed  and  tumors  with  scores  ranging  from 0  to  5  will be 
assigned  to  group  0= low lysyl oxidase,  whereas those with a score of 6 will be assigned 
to group 1=high lysyl oxidase. 
 
Ki-67 
 
5μm formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded  tissue will be subjected  to  IHC  for Ki-67 staining 
using the MIB1 mouse mAb (Immunotech, Westbrook, ME) at a 1:[ADDRESS_1277204] 
avidin–biotin–peroxidase  complex  techniques  will  be  used.  Antigen  retrieval  in  heated 
citrate  buffer  at  pH  6.0  will be  applied.  Slides  will be counterstained  with hematoxylin. 
Only nuclear staining of tumor cells will be considered positive. Ki67 expression will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_31576]-quantitatively  assessing the percentage of positive  tumor cells. 
 
Tissue Banking 
 
With  the  patient’s  consent,  we  willl  bank  the  additional  and  left  over  tissue  after  the 
biopsy (Cohort 1) or surgical resection (Cohort 2) in Tissue Procurement Service (TPS). 
To further access this tissue, we will submit a plan to the Human Biospeciman Utilization 
Committee   (HBUC).   For   retrospective  feasibility  studies,   tissue  use  at  MSKCC   is 
governed by [CONTACT_909702]. The HBUC has trans-departmental and multidisciplinary 
representation.      As  institutional  policy,   the  HBUC  will  give  special  consideration  to 
tissues requested  for correlative analysis as part of a clinical trial,  or to develop a tissue

bank   at   an   academic   institution,   cooperative  group   or  corporate  entity.   While  the 
specimens  for  this  protocol  will  reside  in  local  repositories,  we  will  nevertheless  seek 
HBUC approval for use of the resources in this study as other investigators in the Center. 
We  recognize  that  specimen  resources  are  ultimately  institutional  resources,  wherever 
they are stored and by [CONTACT_909703]. Approval by [CONTACT_909704].  Each specific research use proposed  for use 
of these banked  specimens will be reviewed  in the context of the scientific study design 
and human  subjects’ protection implications. 
 
In a series of check boxes at the end of the consent form, patients in both Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 2  are asked  if: 1) they permit their biospecimen to  be  stored and used in future 
research to learn about or prevent cancer or side effects of treatment, or to develop new 
treatments; 2) if they permit their samples to be stored and used in future research to learn 
about, prevent, or treat diseases other than cancer; or 3) if they permit their samples, with 
personal identifiers protected, to be used for research about inherited genetic factors; 4) if 
they permit their samples to be used for genetic analysis of the tumor and normal samples 
to learn about the causes of cancer; 5) if they agree to be contact[CONTACT_909705];  6)  if  they  consent  to  be  contact[CONTACT_909706]; and  7) if he/she (the patient) is  not available 
(e.g.  deceased),  if they wish to have their designee designated on the consent form to be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
 
Participants will not be provided  with specific results of research tests performed on their 
collected  human  biologic specimens.  With their permission,  the patient may be contact[CONTACT_909707],  if 
they would consent to research that would allow updates of their health status and if they 
consented  to  be  contact[CONTACT_909708]. 
 
It  will be  stated  that researchers at MSKCC  may either keep  indefinitely or dispose of 
any   tissues,   including   DNA   that   the  samples  contain.   Tissues  will  be  stored   with 
identifiers  in  secure  tissue  banks.  It  is  stated  that  the  samples  could  be  lost  or  ruined 
because  of mechanical failure,  and  that  MSKCC  cannot  guarantee  that samples will be 
stored indefinitely. The samples will be store for as long as deemed useful for research 
purposes. 
 
The  protocol  consent  form  asks  participants  for  permission  for  re-contact  [CONTACT_909709]. If a participant agrees to be 
re-contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], he/she will not be told  the specific results of the research test,  but will be 
informed  that his/her samples were used in a project and a potential risk was uncovered. 
If the participant is interested  in further discussion of the research findings, he/she will be 
asked to  come into MSKCC Clinical Genetics Service for counseling and specific genetic 
testing.

4.2       Intervention 
 
For patients in Cohort 1,  there willl  be no  change or intervention in a patient’s treatment 
regime using chemoradiation where both the primary and the neck nodes receive 70Gy   if 
the tumors are not associated  with HPV or if there is no  resolution of hypoxia on their 
repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan. This is currently  one accepted standard of care. 
 
Patients in Cohort 1 with tumors that are positive for HPV who exhibited no evidence of 
hypoxia   on   their   baseline   18F-FMISO   PET/CT  scan  or  whose  tumors  have  early 
resolution  of  hypoxia  on  their  repeat  early  response  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan  will 
undergo  an  alternative  treatment  where  the  primary  tumor  site  receives  70Gy  while  the 
neck nodes receive 60Gy followed  by a planned  FDG PET/CT scan and observation. 
 
Select Cohort 2 HPV+ tumors that demonstrate no evidence of hypoxia on an 18F-FMISO 
PET scan will receive 30Gy to the surgical bed and neck lymph  nodes concurrent with 
standard chemotherapy  followed  by a [ADDRESS_1277205] pathologic 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 04 -070 A(38) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1277206] chemoradiation  will be given.  All other patients in this 
cohort (i.e. those who are not in the select HPV+ tumor group outlined  above) will 
receive standard of care treatment  following  their surgery. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS 
 
DCE-MRI   studies   will  be  acquired   using  a  fast  multi-phase  spoiled   gradient  echo 
sequence.  A  Gadolinium-based  agent  will  be  used  for  DCE-MRI  studies.  This  is  the 
standard contrast agent used with MRIs. 
 
18F-FMISO is prepared and tested for quality assurance in this study at MSKCC or by [CONTACT_909713].     The  radiopharmaceutical  is  being  utilized  in  this  protocol 
under a MSKCC IND. 
 
Radionuc lide  dosimetry 
Biodistribution data on 18F-FMISO has been obtained for 60 patients at the University of 
Washington,  School of Medicine,  and  do simetry was performed. The normal organ doses 
absorbed  following 18F-FMISO  administration was published  by  [CONTACT_359515].  (15) and

7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN (WITH LIMITED WAIVER OF AUTHORIZATION) 
 
Patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_909715].     The  attending  physician  will obtain  informed  consent  from the 
eligible  patient. 
 
Potential research subjects willl  be identified by a member of the patient’s treatment team, 
the protocol investigator, or research team at MSKCC.   If the investigator is a member of 
the  treatment  team,  s/he  willl  screen  their  patient’s  medical records for suitable research 
study  p articipants  and  discuss  the  study  and  their  potential for  enrolling  in the research 
study.   Potential subjects contact[CONTACT_423035]/research  staff of the study. 
 
The  Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_909676]  a  treatment  relationship  for  the  l i mited  purpose  of identifying patients 
who would be eligible to enroll in the study and to record appropriate contact [CONTACT_909716]. 
 
During  the  initial conversation  b etween  the investigator/research staff and  the patient,  the 
patient  may  be  asked  to  provide  certain  health  information  that  is  necessary  to  the 
recruitment  and   enrollment  process.     The  investigator/research  staff  may  also  review 
portions of their medical records at MSKCC  in order to  further assess eligibility.    They 
will use the information provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or medical record to confirm that the 
patient  is  eligible  and  to  contact  [CONTACT_909717].    If the  patient 
turns  out  to  be  ineligible  for  the  research  study,  the  research  staff  will  destroy  all 
information  collected  on  the  patient  during  the  initial  conversation  and  medical records 
review,  except for any information  that must be maintained  for screening  log purposes. 
 
In most cases,  the initial contact [CONTACT_909718],  investigator  or  the  research  staff  working  in  consultation  with  the

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
For patients in Cohort 1,  there willl  be no  change or intervention in a patient’s treatment 
regime using chemoradiation where both the primary and the neck nodes receive 70 Gy   if 
the tumors are not associated  with HPV or if there is no  resolution of hypoxia on their 
repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan. 
 
Patients in Cohort 1 with tumors that are positive for HPV who exhibited no evidence of 
hypoxia   on   their   baseline   18F-FMISO   PET/CT  scan  or  whose  tumors  have  early 
resolution  of  hypoxia  on  their  repeat  early  response  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan  will 
undergo  an  alternative  treatment  where  the  primary  tumor  site  receives  70Gy  while  the 
neck nodes receive 60Gy followed  by a planned  FDG PET/CT scan and observation. 
 
Select Cohort 2 HPV+ tumors that demonstrate no evidence of hypoxia on an 18F-FMISO 
PET scan will receive 30Gy to the surgical bed and neck lymph  nodes concurrent with 
standard chemotherapy  followed  by a [ADDRESS_1277215] chemoradiation  will be given.  All other patients in this 
cohort (i.e. those who are not in the select HPV+ tumor group outlined  above) will 
receive standard of care treatment  following  their surgery. 
 
Please note that for patients who  receive a repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan, the repeat 
18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan  will  only  be  performed  5-10  days  into  chemoradiotherapy 
treatment.   For  Cohort  1  patients,  a  repeat  18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan  will  only  be 
performed  if the pretreatment  baseline  18F-FMISO PET scan is positive for hypoxia. 
 
Chemotherapy  will be administered  in two doses. Chemotherapy  will begin +/- [ADDRESS_1277216] day of radiation  therapy. The second cycle of chemotherapy  will begin 3 
weeks later (+/- 5 days), although  d elays for safety (e.g., low white blood count, elevated 
creatinine)  are allowed.  Standard chemotherapy  with either Cisplatin  or  Carboplatin/5- 
Fluorouracil is strongly  recommended.  Any other schedule (e.g., weekly chemotherapy) 
is discouraged  and requires approval of the principal investigator. 
 
• Patients should receive standard high dose Cisplatin  chemotherapy  at 100 mg/m². 
If the patient is unfit  or cannot tolerate Cisplatin,  the treating  physician  must 
discuss with study medical oncologist,  [CONTACT_909728],  to jointly  confirm what 
chemotherapy  should be given  in place of Cisplatin.

10.0 EVALUATION  DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION 
 
All patients will be evaluated  according to  the standard  of care  for their head  and neck 
cancer. 
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS 
 
No side effects are expected as a result of this study. However, in the unlikely event that 
an adverse reaction to either radiopharmaceutical occurs, these toxicities will be graded 
according  to  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.0. 
The results will be documented and reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_909677].

Patients who  partake in the optional storage and  analysis of tissue samples will not have 
additional risks or toxicities  other than the unauthorized  and inadvertent  release of PHI. 
 
Gadavist,  a  gadolinium-based  contrast  agent,  is  the  standard  contrast  agent  utilized  in 
contrast  MRIs.  However,  adverse  reactions  to  gadolinium-based  contrast  agents  have 
been  do cumented,  which may include headaches,  rash,  and  itching.  Furthermore, 
gadolinium-based  contrast  agents  are  associated  with  a  risk  for  Nephrogenic  Systemic 
Fibrosis (NSF) and renal failure. Due to these associated risks, subjects enrolled on this 
protocol with a known contraindication to the standard MRI contrast agent (Gadavist, a 
gadolinium-based   contrast   agent)   and/or  a  recent  estimated   glomerular  filtration  rate

12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOM E  ASSESSMENT 
 
Not applicable. 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
If at any time  the patient develops progressive disease he/she will be taken off study and 
referred  for  alternative  therapy.  If at any time  the patient develops unacceptable toxicity 
he/she will be removed from study. 
 
If at  any  time  the patient is found  to  be  ineligible for the protocol as designated  in the 
section  on  Criteria  for  Patient/Subject  Eligibility  (i.e.,  a  change  in diagnosis),  the patient 
will be removed from the study. 
 
If at any time a patient wishes to participate in the optional sub-study regarding additional 
banking and  analysis of tissue  via the optional biopsy (Cohort 1) or via the standard  of 
care  surgical resection  (Cohort  2),  the  patient  has a right to  withdraw participation and 
prohibit any future use of their biologic specimen that has not already been undertaken. If 
the specimen has already been sent out from the archive for research purposes, it cannot 
be  excluded  from the research,  nor would  any results derived  from the research activity 
be excluded.

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Cohort 1 will accrue a cohort of 150 head and neck cancer patients over 5 years, of 
which  100  will  be  HPV+  tumors  and  50  will  be  HPV-  tumors.  Due  to  biomarker 
screening  and  to  accommodate  a  20%  exclusion  rate,  in  order  to  reach  [ADDRESS_1277221]  of care . 
We  will  image  50  non-HPV  positive  patients  to  evaluate  the  ability  of  dynamic  18F- 
FMISO  PET  scanning  to  accurately  determine  the  location  hypoxia  sub-regions  within 
the  tumor  volume.      For those HPV negative patients whose  18F-FMISO  PET exhibits 
hypoxia, we will also perform a repeat 18F-FMISO PET/CT scan 5-10 days into treatment 
with chemoradiotherapy.    This will provide us the volume of hypoxic region at the 5-10 
days  time-point.    The  changes in the volume of the hypoxic regions after 5-10  d ays of 
therapy  will  be  summarized.  We  estimate  that  40  HPV  negative  patients  will  require 
repeat  18F-FMISO  PET.  Among  these  patients,  we  anticipate Wilcoxon rank  sum tests 
willl  be used  when the imaging results are measured  continuously and Fisher’s exact tests 
will be  applied  when  the  imaging  results  are  dichotomized.  We will also  search for the 
best cut-off value for SUV and/or k3  to predict “response”. To this end, we willl  examine 
all possible cut-off values and the corresponding  sensitivity  and specificity. 
 
The Youden index,  defined  as sensitivity+specificity-1,  will be used to determine the best 
cut-off  value  for  SUV.  For  long-term treatment  outcomes,  Kaplan-Meier  estimates  will 
be  calculated  for  each  stratum and  compared  using the log-rank  tests.  When competing 
risks are present (death without distant metastasis), Gray’s test willl be used. Due to the 
moderate   sample   size,   we   may   not   have   enough   power   for   declaring   statistical 
significance for our tests, in which cases we will report all summary and test statistics and 
point out future  research directions. 
 
As 18F-FDG PET scans are routinely obtained  before and  after chemoradiation for head 
and   neck   cancer,   we   will  include   a   prospective   MTV   (metabolic   tumor   volume) 
calculation  in  addition  to  the  already  calculated  standard  uptake  value  (SUV)  for  the 
routine  18F-FDG  PET  scans.    We  will not  alter  any patient management based  on  the 
calculated  MTV.  The  MTV,  defined  as  tumor  volume  with  42%  or  greater  of  the 
maximum    18Fluorine-fluoro-deoxyglucose     (18F-FDG)    signal    intensity    on    positron 
emission   tomography   (PET),   has   been  demonstrated   to   correlate  with  loco -regional 
control,  freedom  from  distant  metastases,  and  overall  survival  in  oropharyngeal  cancer 
patients treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy at MSKCC (21). These findings 
corroborate  those  of  previously  published  retrospective  studies  from  Stanford  Medical 
Center (22, 23 ).

100  HPV+  patients  with negative  baseline  scan  or early resolution of tumor hypoxia of 
their node(s) at 5-10 treatment days into chemoradiation, defined by [CONTACT_909720] 18F-FMISO uptake on PET/CT, will achieve an equivalent nodal control 
with  nodal  radiation  dose  at  60Gy  in  the  setting  of  chemotherapy  with  concomitant 
reduction  in  treatment-related  complications.  To  test  if  patients  receiving  60Gy  to  the 
node(s)  followed  by  [CONTACT_909721]  70Gy  to  the  nodes  both  in  the  setting  of  co ncurrent 
chemotherapy,   we   will  apply  a  one-sided   one  sample  proportion  test.      Our  past 
experience  is that the nodal control rate at 3  months for such patient with  70Gy to  the 
nodes  is  94%.     We  will  reject  our  hypothesis  of  equivalent  control  whether  patients 
receive  70Gy  to  the  nodes  or  60Gy  to  the  nodes  followed  by  [CONTACT_909722] ≤[ADDRESS_1277222] a power of 
0.93  for detecting that 60Gy will result in 3-month regional control lower than 80% with 
the  type  I  error rate lower than 0.05.    To  test if patients receiving 60Gy to  the nodes 
followed   by  [CONTACT_909723]  [ADDRESS_1277223] 
experience is that this toxicity  rate for patients receiving  70 Gy is around 75%. 
Using  the  total  of  [ADDRESS_1277224]  our 
hypothesis  of  equivalent  or  higher  toxicity  rate  when  the  nodes  receive  10Gy  less 
radiation from 70Gy when ≤[ADDRESS_1277225] one ≥ grade [ADDRESS_1277226] a power of 0.84 for detecting the probability of 60% of patients will have at 
least one ≥grade [ADDRESS_1277227] for 
toxicities  after  3  months  from  chemoradiation.     Instead,  we  will  summarize  the  data 
descriptively  and  when  applicable,  we  will  use  survival analysis  tools  such  as  Kaplan- 
Meier  estimation  and  log-rank  tests to  determine whether 60Gy results in lower toxicity. 
To   examine  the  potential  correlations  between  various  evaluation  methods  for  nodal 
control status, we willl  apply a series of Fisher’s exact tests. 
 
The spatial extent of 18F-FMISO PET imaging  within  the neck node(s) determines  the 
underlying  hypoxia  tumor phenotype for both HPV positive  and negative  HNSCC. To 
determine  whether baseline  18F-FMISO PET/CT and/or early-response  18F-FMISO 
PET/CT  at  5-10  treatment  days  after  chemotherapy  and  IMRT  correlate  with  selected 
proliferative/hypoxia  molecular  markers,  Wilcoxon  rank  sum tests  will  be  used  for  each 
marker. Multiple  testing  adjustments  such as Bonferroni  procedures will be used. To 
investigate  whether the extent of 18F-FMISO PET/CT measured hypoxia  at baseline 
and/or  5-10  treatment  days  into  chemoradiation  for  both  HPV  positive  and  negative 
tumors  correlates  with  the  development  of  distant  metastasis,  Kaplan-Meier  estimates 
will  be  calculated   for  each  stratum  and   compared   using  the  log-rank   tests.  When 
competing risks are present,  Gray’s test willl  be used  to examine the correlation between 
the extent of 18F-FMISO PET/CT measured hypoxia with the development of distant 
metastasis.      To   examine   the   potential  correlations  between  the  baseline  and   early

response  18F-FMISO  PET  imaging  and  tumor’s  underlying  HPV  status,  we  willl  apply 
Fisher’s exact tests. 
 
Multiparametric scans will also  be  obtained. We will attempt comparisons to 18F-FMISO 
PET  results  and  i mmunohistochemistry hypoxia results,  but due to  the small pi[INVESTIGATOR_909678],  we may not produce significant results. In that case, we will present 
summary  statistics  and suggest directions  for future study.

17.0 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Risks  of Study  Participation:    Patients  who  will undergo  a  treatment that deviates from 
the  current  standard  of  care  for  their  disease  will be  those  patients  in  Cohort  [ADDRESS_1277231]-chemoradiation, and a possible booster dose of 
chemoradiation following neck  dissection (this booster dose is dependent on the result of 
the  planned   neck   d issection).   The  risks  involved  include  those  entailed  by  [CONTACT_91959]  a 
decreased   do se  of  radiation  and   a  neck   dissection  at   three  to  four  months  post- 
chemoradiation.  However,  the  risk  associated  with  the  decreased  dose  of  radiation  is 
mediated  by  [CONTACT_909726]-chemoradiation.  Should  any 
residual  disease  be  discovered  at  the  time  of  this  neck  dissection,  the  patient  will be 
treated with a chemoradiation boost per standard of care. These patients will be closely 
monitored throughout their treatment on this protocol, and will receive standard of care 
treatment should  any complications  occur. 
 
Financial  Costs  to  Patients:    All diagnostic  and  therapeutic  interventions  except  for  the 
18F-FMISO   PET/CT   scans   and   the   neck   dissection   three   to   four   months   post- 
chemoradiation for select Cohort 2 patients are part of the current routine care of 
patients/subjects  eligible  for  this  study.  A research grant will cover the cost of the  18F- 
FMISO  -PET  scans  and  the  tracer,  the  optional 18F-FMISO  PET  image-guided  core 
biopsies,  and  the  neck  dissections.  In  addition,  the multiparametric scans on the Phillips 
MR machine will not generate a charge. There are no additional financial costs or burden 
to the patient beyond the charges routinely  incurred  as part of standard medical care. 
 
Patient   Confidentiality:      Patient/subject  privacy  and   confidentiality  will  be  maintained 
according  to  MSKCC  guidelines  and  all data derived  from this study will be kept in a 
secure  database.     All  data  and  results  will  be  anonymously  reported  with  regard  to 
individual  subjects.

Study  Title :  
An Observational S tudy of TKI258 in Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients 
Evaluating Markers of FGF si gnaling  in Bone Marrow Plasma.  
Study Phase:  Phase II Exploratory  
Primary Objective:   
 To estimate overall survival and early response as characterized by a drop in  PSA  
 To identify the PSA modulation  in 40 se lected patient s with advanced prostate 
cancer , and correlate PSA Modulation with c hanges in bone remodeling markers  
Secondary Objective (s): 
 
 To estimate the objective tumor response rate by [CONTACT_612752].  
 To explore the potential association between serum PSA and bone turnover 
markers  with bone marrow FGF R1 and FGF9  while on TKI 258 
 To explore the predictive values of baseline FGF R1, FGF9, and FGF signaling in serum and those in the bone marrow before and during treatment with TKI258. 
 To identify candidate mRNA gene expression changes in bone marrow biopsy aspi[INVESTIGATOR_612721]258  
 To collect and archive bone marrow biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], seru m and plasma in 
study patients  for later hypothesis generating  associations 
 To explore FGF R expression following eight  weeks of TKI 258 
Study Design :  
This is an observational study to explore the effect of TKI258 therapy on bone turnover markers (serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase and urinary N-telopeptides), and 
expression of FGF R 1, on both tumor and host cell compartments in bone marrow. 
Study Population :  
Approximately [ADDRESS_812314], Dose , and Mode of A dministration:   
TKI258 500mg PO daily for [ADDRESS_812315] period. Each cycle is 28 days.  
Duration of Treatment:   
Patient s will continue to receive TKI 258 until progression, unacceptable toxicity or 
withdrawal of consent 
Statistical Met hods:   
This is a phase IIA activity trial of TKI  258 for treatment of castrate resistant prostate 
cancer with  skeletal metastases . The two primary outcomes are survival time and early 
response as characterized by a drop in PSA as defined by  [CONTACT_612753] 
2 criteria. Based on a historical mean survival of time 8 months, a mean survival time on 
average > 10 months with TKI258 would be considered promising evidence of anti- disease 
activity.  The planned sample size is 40 patients, with an antic ipated accrual rate of 3

 patients per month. Based on historical experience using carefully selected candidates with 
evidence for iliac involvement on bone scan, we anticipate that ~6 0% of patients will have 
positive biopsies. No early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612722]- epi[INVESTIGATOR_612723] (SE -pathway) 
may produce clinical benefit  independent of PSA modulation.  Consequently, it may be the 
case that TKI258 does not cause significant reductions in PSA, but survival time is 
prolonged due to inhibition of disease progression. Given the short survival time of these patients and anticipated accrual rate of 3 patients per month, it also will not be feasible to 
implement an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612724].  Based on an historical rate of 20% grade [ADDRESS_812316] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612725] (1998) will be used to monitor toxicity.  
 Unadjusted survival time will be estimated using the meth od of Kaplan and Meier (1958) 
and  the effects of the following four potential prognostic covariates Inhibition of FGF signaling by [CONTACT_612754] 8 weeks, modulation of the bone markers (a) urinary NTX and (b) bone specific alkaline phosphatase, and  baseline signature [CONTACT_612807] R -1, FGF R- 3 and FGF 9 on Prob(PSA response) will be estimated using 
logistic regression, and on survival time will be estimated using the Cox model or an appropriate time -to-event regression model. 
 Preliminaries: This is a phase IIA activity trial of TKI258 for treatment of castrate resistant 
prostate cancer with skeletal metastases . The two primary outcomes are survival time and 
early response as characterized by a drop in PSA as defined by [CONTACT_612755] (25).   
 Historical Experience and Goals: Based on the historical experience in which the mean survival time was 8 months, under a Bayesian model we assume that the unadjusted mean survival time with TKI258 follows an uninform ative inverse gamma with mean 8 and 
variance 1000, equivalently with scale parameter 2.064 and shape parameter 8.512, denoted mE ~ IG(2.064, 8.512).  A mean survival time on average > 10 months would be considered promising evidence of anti- disease activit y.  Formally, assuming that the 
historical mean survival mH ~ IG(52, 400),  TKI258 will be considered promising if, based on the data from the trial,  Pr(mE >  mH | data ) > .95. The planned sample size is 40 patients, with an anticipated accrual rate of 3  patients per month.  In addition, the 
relationships between several potential prognostic covariates and the above clinical outcomes will be explored, as described below.  
Monitoring Rules: No early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612726]- epi[INVESTIGATOR_612727] (SE- pathway) will be related to clinical benefit.  Consequently, it may be the case 
that PSA does not drop but survival time is prolonged due to inhibition of disease progression by [CONTACT_612756]258. Given the short survival time of these patients and anticipated accrual rate of 3 patients per month, it will not be feasible to implement an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612724].  However, based on an historical rate of 20% grade [ADDRESS_812317] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it will be assumed that p = Prob(grade 3 or 4

 with TKI258) follows a beta prior with parameters (.20, .80).  Using the method of Thall 
and Suung (26), based on the observed toxicity data, accrual to the trial will be stopped 
early if Pr(p > .20 | data)  > .95, with this rule applied after successive cohorts f size 5.  This rule says to stop the trial if [# patients with a grade 3 or 4 toxicity]/[# patients evaluated] is greater than or equal to 3/5, 5/10, 7/15, 8/20, 9/25, 11/30, 12/35.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Receptor Tyr osine Kinsases ( RTKs ) are involved in both the growth of different types 
of tumors as well as in the initiation, growth, and maintenance of blood vessels 
supplying the tumor with blood, oxygen, and nutrients (Schlessinger 2000, Arteaga 2001, and Cohen 2002) . Several members of the RTKs are expressed on solid tumors 
and are involved in cancer cell growth and survival (Collett and Erikson 1978; Takahaski, et al 1995) . In some cases, mutations of these RTKs and their subsequent 
aberrant signaling are directly linked to the abnormal growth (Mizuki, et al 2000; 
Deininger, et al 2000) . In many other cases, expression and/or overexpression of 
these RTKs have been demonstrated; however, the exact role of these kinases in driving most cancerous growth is still unknown. Some tumors, however, are known to have their growth driven by a single mutation in a growth factor receptor kinase. These include FLT3 mutations in 20% to 30% of patients with AML (Gilliland and Griffin 2002);  FGFR3 ectopic expression/mutation in 15% to 20% of patients with 
multiple myeloma (Rasmussen, et al. 2003; Li, et al 2001) ; c-KIT in gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors (GIST), a rare form of stomach cancer (DeMatteo 2002), and the 
Philadelphia chromosome fused gene translocation mutation (Bcr abl) in nearly all patients with CML (Druker, et al 2001). 
 
RTKs such as VEGF receptors, FGF receptors, and PDGF receptors have been shown to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis (Dvorak 2003). VEGF is produced 
by [CONTACT_612757] s a direct effect on endothelial cells, 
causing their proliferation, migration, invasion, and growth (Nagy, et al 2002). FGFs are potent stimulators of angiogenesis in both normal and pathological tissues, having a direct effect on both vessel assembly and sprouting (Auguste, et al 2003).  A recent 
publication has demonstrated that a blockade of the FGF pathway can overcome resistance to VEGFR inhibitors, emphasizing the importance of FGFR and specifically the need for multi- targeted inhibitors (Casanovas, et al 2005).  PDGF 
receptors are expressed on pericytes - smooth muscle cells that surround the 
vasculature and provide maintenance and support to the tumor neovasculature (Bergers, et al 2003) . Inhibition of these three growth factor receptor kinases should 
provide a powerful and broad inhibition of the angiogenesis process and provide potent antitumor effects. TKI258 is a potent inhibitor of these three RTKs as well as other RTKs directly involved in tumor cell growth, particularly activating mutations of c-KIT and FLT3. Nonclinical studies were conducted with TKI258 free base or its 
lactate, mesylate, or hydrochloride salts. For consistency, these forms are collectively referred to as TKI258 in this document.   As mentioned above, the pathways and growth factors involved in angiogenesis and tumor cell growth are very complex and in many cases redundant. The first generation receptor kinase inhibitors to undergo clinical trials were in many cases specific inhibitors of a single receptor kinase. Compounds such as gefitinib (Iressa®) (EGFR), SU5416 (VEGF), and PTK787 (VEGF) are examples of some of the earlier, single targeted kinase inhibitors (Arteaga 2003; Dancey and Sausville 2003). A 
second generation kinase inhibitor, SU6668, hits a variety of kinase targets, including PDGFR, VEGFR, and FGFR. Other drug candidates such as ZD6474 (vandetanib),

 SU11248 (sunitinib), and B AY43-9006 (sorafenib) were later developed to have 
activity against a variety of growth factor receptor kinases. Sunitinib (Sutent®) and 
soraf enib (Nexavar®) have recently been approved for the treatment of advanced 
renal cell carcinoma, an indication with a high level of VEGF -induced angiogenesis. 
Sunitinib was also approved in refractory GIST, a tumor type driven by [CONTACT_612758] c -KIT. The approval of these drugs provides clinical rationale for the 
development of additional multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors with different target profiles. TKI258 is from a novel chemical series, inhibits multiple cancer or angiogenesis related kinases, and has favorable physicochemical and PK properties. TKI258 has potent activity in a variety of nonclinical tumor xenograft and targeted -tumor or angiogenesis animal models.  
 
1.2 Background /Rationale 
Androgen deprivation (AD) therapy induces a remission in 80% to 90% of patients with advanced prostate cancer and results in a median progre ssion -free survival of 12 
to 33 months, at which time; an androgen -independent phenotype usual ly emerges.  
 Androgen deprivation can be achieved surgically with orchiectomy, or medically using some form of drug treatment that lowers serum testosterone .  Medical castration 
is commonly achieved with luteinizing hormone - releasing  hormone (LHRH) 
agonists (for example, Lupron).  The conventionally accepted de finition of castration 
is a serum concentration of testosterone to less then 50 ng/dl. Additional anti-androgen therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612729]: (1) block testosterone activity (for example, bicalutimide), (2) block adrenal synthesis of testosterone (for example, 
ketoconazole); or (3) synthetic estrogens (for example, DES). These agents are generally used to treat  patients who demonstrate PSA and/or clinical progression 
while on Lupron monotherapy. Because m any cancers  continue to respond to these 
“second -line” hormonal strategies ( given either singly or in combination) despi[INVESTIGATOR_612730], this clinical state is referred to  “castrate- resistant” 
disease ( as opposed to “hormone- refractory” disease).   
 After failure of anti -androge n therapy, p atients with castrate -resistant prostate cancer 
are routinely treated with cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Two randomized trials testing docetaxel based regimen s demonstrated PSA responses ranging from 40 to 50% but 
only a modest survival benefit of ~ 2 to 3 months. Chemotherapy was  also associated 
with significant toxicities, including grade 3/4 neutropenia (~30%), infections (~6%), anemia (~5%), fatigue (~5%), dyspnea (~3%), nausea (~3%), diarrhea (~2%) and neuropathy (~1.5%). Based on these data, docetaxel -based chemotherapy is an option 
for patients with castrate -resistant disease but is  not considered “standard of care”.    
Current research efforts are now focused on identify ing novel molecularly targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] t hat will reduce morbidity and mortality from castrate- resistant disease and 
obviate (or at least delay) the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
 The propensity for prostate cancer to metastasize to the skeleton  has led investigates 
to speculate that the tumor microenvironment and the stromal- epi[INVESTIGATOR_97072] s 
within bone are critical for  prostate cancer progression. Furthermore, the development 
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812320] invariably associated with some extent of tumor 
infiltration into  the bone marrow.  There is evidence of increased expression of 
androgen converting genes in the castrate-resistant bone marrow tumor 
microenvironment.   MD Anderson Experimental observation:  
We recently discovered that prostate cancer cell s, especially those that had 
metastasized to bone, overexpress fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), a discovery that prompted us to study how FGF9 participates in prostate cancer progression and metastasis.  FGF9 (also known as glial activating factor) is a secreted, glycosylated
 
26-kDa protein that has mitogeni c effects on a variety of different cell types. In the 
normal prostate, FGF9 is not expressed by [CONTACT_612759][INVESTIGATOR_1663], but is expressed by [CONTACT_612760] [21]. We have recently found positive staining for FGF9 in 
prostate cancer cells in 24 of 5 6 primary tumors derived from organ-confined prostate 
cancer and in all the bone metastases cases studied (25 of 25) (Table 1 and Figure 1). Findings were confirmed by [CONTACT_937]- PCR analysis of RNA obtained by [CONTACT_612761][INVESTIGATOR_612731] (Figure 1 a). This switch in the source of FGF9 
from the stroma to the cancer cells could increase the availability of FGF9, thereby [CONTACT_612762]  (Li, et al. 2008) .

 To obtain preclinical evidence of the role of FGF9 in the osteoblastic progression of 
prosta te cancer cells in bone, we used a new prostate cancer xenograft (MDA PCa 
118b) derived from a bone metastases in a man with castrate resistant prostate cancer. MDA PCa 118b cells, which express high FGF9 levels, induce the proliferation of cocultured osteoblasts  in vitro  and can grow and induce a strong osteoblastic reaction 
in the bone of immunodeficient mice. We found that MDA PCa 118b–induced osteoblast proliferation in vitro  was blocked by [CONTACT_9266]9 antibody and that FGF9 
induced the formation of new bone i n an organ -culture assay.  To assess in vivo  the 
relevance of FGF9 in the osteoblastic bone growth of this model, we examined the effect of blocking FGF9 signals in mice injected with MDA PCa 118b cells into their femurs. We injected MDA PCa 118b (1X10
6) cells into the femurs of [ADDRESS_812322] FGF9 (R&D (Clone [ZIP_CODE]), 250 µg/mouse) i.v. twice weekly and another 10 mice were treated with IgG isotype (R&D, 250 µg/mouse) i.v. twice weekly. Treatment s tarted the same day of 
cell injection and was performed for five consecutive weeks at which time tumor volumes in the femurs were determined by [CONTACT_612763] [22] .  MRI analysis of MDA PCa 118b tumors five weeks after cell 
injection demonstrated that the mice treated with FGF9 neutralizing antibody developed significant smaller tumors than controls did ( P=0.011, Figure 1b ). In order 
to assess whether the MDA PCa 118 induced bone reaction was also affected by [CONTACT_9266]9 blockade, we subsequently monitor the tumor associated bone mass by [CONTACT_12884] X-ray analysis and terminated the experiment 7 weeks after cell injection ([ADDRESS_812323] end of treatment).  We then performed specimen micro CT analysis (20 µm resolution) of tumor bearing bones and found a significantly lower bone volume in the femur of treated than in control mice ( P=0.0057). Accordingly, histological 
analysis of tumor bearing bones demonstrated areas of woven bone in control but not 
in treated femurs (Figure 2).   Taken together, these results suggest that FGF9 plays an important role in the osteoblastic progression of prostate cancer cells in bone  (Li et 
al. 2008) .

 1.3 Drug and Dosing Information  
TKI258 ( dovitinib lactate ) is an investigational new drug initially discovered and 
developed under the name [CONTACT_612808]-258 by [CONTACT_612765], now part of [COMPANY_001]. 
TKI258 inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in solid and hematologic cancers, as well as tumor angiogenesis. Based upon its potency as an inhibitor of Class III/IV/V RTK signaling both in vitro and in vivo , and pharmaceutical properties 
including high oral bioavailabi lity in three species, TKI258 is being studied in clinical 
trials as a cancer therapeutic.  
 TKI258 has in vitro inhibitory activity against vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor kinases with IC50 values of approximately 10 nM. These structurally related receptors are important for the growth and survival of endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis; PDGFR and FGFR are also believed to play a role in the proliferation of certain tumor cells and supporting stromal cells. Based on growth factor specific cell based assays and kinase assays, additional kinases such as stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor 1 (C SF 1R), tyrosine receptor kinase A (TrkA) and the Ret oncogene are also 
inhibited in vitro with IC50s below 10 nM (for c-KIT, FLT3, TrkA and RET) and 
below 40 nM (for CSF 1R). c-KIT and FLT3 have been implicated to play a role in leukemias; CSF 1R has been  implicated in the activation of osteoclast progenitor 
cells, initiating bone resorption in multiple myeloma, and other cancers that are associated with bone metastasis. Distantly related RTKs and most serine/threonine kinases were not inhibited by [CONTACT_612756]258.  As a result of inhibition of RTKs by [CONTACT_612756]258, cellular functions are blocked, including activation of downstream-signaling molecules, cellular proliferation, and survival. In cultured human endothelial cells expressing VEGFR, TKI258 inhibits VEGF stimulated mitogenesis.  In a FGF2 dependent model of angiogenesis, TKI258 potently inhibited neovascularization of Matrigel plugs in vivo with an average ED50 
of 3 mg/kg. The effects on endothelial cells suggest that TKI258 may have potent antiangiogenic activity . Additionally, direct antiproliferative effects were observed in 
cell lines; those cells that expressed an RTK inhibited by [CONTACT_612756]258 were most sensitive to the drug (MV4;11: an acute myeloid leukemia [AML] cell line driven by [CONTACT_612766]3; TF 1: a AML cell line driven by c -KIT; KMS11: a 
multiple myeloma line driven by [CONTACT_612767]3; RT112 and RT4 bladder cancer cell lines overexpressing FGFR3; and the colon cancer cell line KM12L4a, driven by [CONTACT_612768]3- TRKA translocation). Antitumo r effects for this agent 
may therefore be conferred by [CONTACT_36939], antistromal activity, and antiproliferative activity directed against tumor cells that directly express TKI258 targets.  
 The antitumor activity of TKI258 was evaluated in a variety of tumor xenograft models in athymic mice. In all models tested, TKI258 administered orally caused anti-tumor responses, ranging from growth inhibition and stasis to regression in tumor 
models driven by [CONTACT_612769]258 targets. Furthermore, in a model of 
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812324] cancer cells in the livers of mice from a 
subcutaneous (SC) xenograft primary was significantly reduced by [CONTACT_612770]258. To demonstrate that direct inhibition of RTKs in tumors was a pr imary 
mechanism of xenograft growth inhibition by [CONTACT_612756]258, tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR2, PDGFR β, FGFR3 and the downstream- signaling proteins AKT (also 
known as protein kinase B) and ERK (also known as MAPK) was shown to be inhibited following a single oral dose of TKI258. Inhibition was observed up to 24 hours (h) in some models. These results indicate that TKI258 may be useful in the treatment of disseminated disease and leukemia, as well as solid tumors and myeloma. The broad target profile of TKI258 is likely to contribute to its efficacy in many different types of tumor models by [CONTACT_612771].  
 The safety of TKI258 was evaluated on a daily dosing schedule in rats, dogs, and monkeys.  The dose- limiting toxicity in all animal species tested was gastrointestinal 
irritation reflected in emesis, diarrhea, severely decreased food consumption, and severe body weight loss. There were no target organs identified for clinical monitoring other than GI irritation. At severely toxic doses, morbidity was attributed to emaciation. Comparison of plasma exposure between species for a ssessment of a 
safety margin was confounded by [CONTACT_29623]-dependent reduction in plasma exposure of TKI258 (as assessed by [CONTACT_331578] [Cmax] and area under the concentration time curve [AUC] values) following repeated oral administration. Therefore, body surface area -normalized dosing between species provided the most 
accurate prediction of safety.  
 TKI258 is manufactured for use in clinical trials as a  100mg hard gelatin capsule. As 
of 10 September 2010, there were a total of 420 patients enrolled in the nine Phase I and three Phase II single agent clinical studies: CTKI258A1101 (1101) (advanced 
solid tumors), CTKI258A2101 (2101) (advanced solid tumors), CTKI258A2102 (2102) (acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), CTKI258A2103 (2103) and CTKI258A2104 (2104) (multiple myeloma [MM]), CTKI258A2105 (2105) (locally advanced or metastatic melanoma), CTKI258A2106 (2106) (advanced solid malignancies,) CTKI258A2107 (2107) advanced/ metastatic renal cell  cancer (RCC), 
CTKI258A2112 (2112) (Phase 1, Bioavailabili ty - FMI capsules),  CTKI258A2116 
(2116) (Phase I, Bioavailability - FMI tablets), CTKI258A2202 (2202) (Phase II, 
metastatic breast cancer) and CTKI258A2204 (2204) (Phase II, multiple myleoma). Clinical studies 2101, 2102, 2103, 2104, [ADDRESS_812325] been discontinued and the 1101, 2107, 2112, 2116, 2201, 2202 and 2204 studies are ongoing. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TKI258 for the continuous daily dosing regimen was defined at 400 mg/day (study 2105); the MTD for the intermittent dosing regimen o f 5 days 
on/2 days off was defined at 500 mg/day (study 2107). The MTD has not been established in Japanese population (dose escalation is still ongoing for study 1101).   Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory data (hematology and chemistry) were available from [ADDRESS_812326] commonly reported non-
laboratory AEs were nausea, fatigue/asthenia, diarrhea, vomiting and

 anorexia/decreased appetite for both  continuous daily dosing and 5 days on/2 days off 
dosing regimens. Commonly reported AEs  were reversible and manageable; most 
were mild or moderate in severity (CTCAE grade 1 or  2). 
 
The majority of the hematology laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2 events across all  dosing regimens. In continuous dosing regimen studies, five patients (3.5%) 
had grade 4 hemoglobin values, 7 patients (7.4%) had grade 4 absolute neutrophil count (ANC) values, 19 patients (14.6%) had grade 4 platelet counts, and 9 patients (6.9%) had grade 4 WBC values during study participation. The relativ ely higher 
incidence rate of grade 3/4 hematology abnormalities in the continuous daily dosing regimen was mainly due to acute myeloid leukemia (study 2102) and multiple myeloma (studies 2103 and 2104) patients. In global 5 days on/2 days off dosing regime n studies, 2 patients (1.3%) had grade 4 ANC values, 1 patient (0.5%) had 
grade 4 platelet counts, and no patients had grade 4 hemoglobin or white blood counts during study participation. Also, one patient (4.5%) had grade 4 hemoglobin in the Japanese 5 da ys on/[ADDRESS_812327] elevations (aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkatine phoshatase, and total bilirubin). In most cases these changes  were CTC grades [ADDRESS_812328] abnormailites were seen  in < 10% of patients treated with dovitinib. 
There was one fatal case of hepatoxicity  (cholestatic liver injury); both the death and 
the heaptotoxicity were deemed related to  dovitinib treatment by [CONTACT_093].  
As of the 10 September 2010 cutoff date, data from a total of 5196 ECGs (of which [ADDRESS_812329] -treatment) were obtained from 360 patients across ten studies (2101, 
2102, 2103, 2104, 2105, 2107, 2112, 2201, 2202, and 2204). The time- averaged 
changes from baseline ECG for each patient across different study days and dose groups were investigated. Outlier  analyses were performed according to the ICH E14 
guidance. The results of the analyses of   the available ECG data do not reveal any 
effect of TKI258 on cardiac repolarization across days and doses of therapy, nor is there any specifi c outlier signal observed consistent with the central tendency finding.  
 In September 2009, an exposure ECG analysis was conducted through a mixed effect linear  model using 546 matching ECG- TKI258 concentration data from 61 patients 
(studies 2105 and 2107 in which more timepoints with ECG monitoring and PK sample collection were  availabe). The exposure- ECG analysis confirmed the 
conclusion of no-QTc prolonging signal from central tendency and outlier analyses.  
 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) data  were available from [ADDRESS_812330]-treatment data from studies 2101, 2102, 2103, 2104, 2105, 
2107, 2112, 2201, 2202 and 2204. Of these patients, 21 had ≥ 20% post- treatment 
LVEF decrease on ECHO or MUGA. Among the 21 patients, 11 patients had LVEF decrease to a value that was below  50%. The LVEF data were reviewed by [CONTACT_612772] 2008- [ADDRESS_812331] on the LVEF.  In summary, based on the available data, no consistent pattern of cardiac events related to  TKI258 administration has been observed to date. More data will be 
collected to further assess the cardiac safety in relationship to TKI258 treatment.  
Although efficacy was not the primary end point for the dose escalation portion of the Phase I  trials, preliminary efficacy data were obtained from some of the studies. Two 
metastatic renal  cell cancer patients treated at 500 mg on a 5 -day on/ 2- days off 
dosing regimen in study 2107 achieved confirmed partial response (PR). A FLT3- ITD 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  patient who was treated at 100 mg/day in study 2102 
achieved a morphologic complete  remission with incomplete blood count recovery. 
Unfortunately the patient’s peripheral blood count did not recover and the patient died unexpectedly due to a fungal infection, secondary to diseae progression. This patient stayed on the study for 69 days. A metastatic melanoma patient who was treated at 175 mg/day in study 2101 achieved a partial response at the end of cycle 11 and 
remained on treatment for 3.3 years (1217 days) before discontinued due to disease progression.   As of March 2010, pharmacokinetic data were available from 178 patients in studies CTKI258A2101, CTKI258A2102, CTK2582103/2104, CTKI258A2105, CTKI258A2106 and CTKI258A2107. Noncompartmental analysis was conducted on full plasma PK profiles of TKI258. Coefficients of variation in the PK parameters (Cmax and AUC
24hr) were between 16 and  111%. Cmax was observed at 
approximately 4 - 8 hours after dosing, and the concentration of TKI258 declined monoexponentially thereafter. Within the tested dose levels ranging from 25 to 600 mg/day, linear absorption of TKI258 was observed. TKI258 was extensively distributed to tissues.   
 Time -dependent PK of TKI258 was observed across all tested dose levels ranging 
from 25 to 600 mg/day. Following daily administration at dose below 400 mg, the auto-induction of CYP1A1/A2 resulted in lower plasma exposure of TKI258 on day 7 
(steady state) than that  observed on day 1. However, after increasing the daily dose to 
400 - 600 mg, TKI258 plasma concentration on day 7 was found to be similar to or greater than that on day 1, suggesting a more pronounced accumulation of TKI258 at higher doses. In addition, an over-proportional  increase in TKI258 plasma exposure 
was observed with doses from 400 to 600 mg/day. The maximum tolerated dose of TKI258 for the continuous daily dosing schedule was 400 mg (CTKI258A2105).  The time -dependent PK and the nonlinear PK resulted in dose- dependent time to 
reach steady  state, as well as dose-dependent accumulation at steady state. To prevent 
the prolonged and over-proportional accumulation in TKI258 exposure with dose escalation, an intermittent dosing schedule of 5 days on/2 days off was proposed for study CTKI258A2107. At tested dose levels of 500 mg and 600 mg, no accumulation was observed on day 15 (steady state).

 The MTD for the 5 days on/2 days off dosing schdule was 500 mg (CTKI258A2107). 
The human ADME study identified the major metabolites as C -hydroxyl metabolites 
(in feces) and N -oxide (in plasma). The ADME study demonstrated that majority of 
the total dose administered was recovered from feces, and less than 21% of the dose was recovered in urine.   No formal drug -drug interaction s tudies have been conducted. Available data from 
human as well as in vitro studies demonstrated that TKI258 has low or no inhibition 
potential for CYP450s. Therefore, TKI258 is not expected to cause inhibitory metabolic drug -drug interactions when co-admini stered with drugs metabolized by 
[CONTACT_097]450s. TKI258 induces CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19; hence co-administration with substrates of  CYP1A2/2C9/2C19 could reduce the exposure of 
these substrates.   
 A relative bioavailability study (CTKI258A2112) was conducted t o compare the final 
market  image (FMI) capsule of TKI258 (monohydrate salt) with the clinical service 
form (CSF) capsule of TKI258 (anhydrate salt). PK data from [ADDRESS_812332] of food on the bioavailability of TKI258 was studied in 19 patients with advanced solid tumors (CTKI258A2112 Arm 2;   FMI capsu le formulation).   The PK 
of TKI258 following administration with no meal (i.e. at least [ADDRESS_812333] 2 hours following a light meal) (NM), with a low -fat meal (LF) or 
with a high -fat meal (HF) were compared to determine the relative bioavailability of 
drug administered with LF and HF compared to NM.  The results demonstrated that 
there was no clinically relevant effect on the AUC or Cmax of TKI258 when administered with either LF or HF meal relative to NM (please refer to the cur rent IB 
for additional information).  However, the study design did not allow an assessment 
of the impact of consistently taking the daily TKI258 dose with HF in the multiple -
dosing condition, compared to no effect expected when consistently taking the dru g 
with LF and NM, or occasionally with HF.  Based on the results of the food effect 
test, TKI258 may be taken, as previously, without food, or with an amount of food up to the level tested, i.e. low -fat meal of ≤ 500 calories with ≤ 20 grams fat. 
 Examples of a low -fat meal of approximately 500 calories and 20 grams of fat  
include: (1) 6 ounces (approximately 177 mL) of orange juice (except  Seville), 8 
ounces (approximately 237 mL) of 2% milk, [ADDRESS_812334] and 2 teaspoons (approximately 10 ml) of butter; (2) 1 cup of plain congee/porridge (approximately 240- 250mL), 1 cooked salted duck egg or 1 
preserved duck egg and 1 steamed pork bun; (3) 1 cup of steamed rice (186 g), 1 cup 
of miso soup (approximately 240- 250mL), fried soybean curd (30 g) and [ADDRESS_812335] been reported as a pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker for 
drugs of  anti-VEGF/VEGFR pathways such as bevacizumab (Avastin ®), sunitinib 
(Sutent ®) and  PTK787/ZK222584. The preliminary PD data from study 2102 (AML) 
indicated that VEGF  levels were increased in patients treated with TKI258 at 400 mg 
dose but not at lower doses.  In the melanoma trial (study 2105), plasma VEGF level were increased 2-5 fold at cycle 1 day 26 in 3 patients treated at 400 mg and 4 out of 5 patients at 500 mg. Patients at all dose levels  had 20-30% reduction of soluble VEGFR2 in plasma, which 
is consistent with other VEGFR2  inhibitor such as sunitinib and sorafenib 
(Nexavar
®).  
 Reduction of leukemic blasts either in bone marrow or in peripheral blood has proven to be a robust marker of tumor burden in clinical trials of FLT3 inhibitors and ha s 
been routinely monitored as a primary response marker. In study 2102, a total of [ADDRESS_812336] increases without any reduction while on the study; 22 showed > 50% blast cell count reduction at some point during the study and [ADDRESS_812337] reduction for these 16 patients was 21 days (range 2 - 82). Of the 22 patients who had > 50% 
blast cell count reduction, 7 patients were FLT3-ITD and 15 patients were FLT3 -WT. 
  
 
1.3.1 Physical, chemical and pharmaceutical properties  
TKI258 lactate salt (TKI258 or TKI258 LC) is designated chemically as (4 Amino 5 
fluoro 3 [6 (4 methyl 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_200270]) 1H benzimidazol 2 yl] 2(1H) quinolinone mono DL lactate) and its structural formula is:  
 
 
 
TKI258 is a yellow to orange and/or brownish tinged, nonhygroscopic solid that disso ciates into TKI258 free base and lactic acid between 125 to 250
oC. Its molecular 
formula is C21H21FN6O • C3H6O3 (molecular weight 482.5). TKI258 is freely soluble in water, DMSO, 1 methy 2 pyrrolidone, and acetic acid. In buffered aqueous solutions, depending on the prevailing pH, TKI258 reverts back to the appropriate

 ionized species or free base. Since the degree of ionization is pH dependent, the 
solubility of TKI258 varies with pH (e.g., 6 μg/mL at pH 7 and 13.6 mg/mL at pH 2). 
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_812338] gelatin capsule contains TKI258 equivalent to 100 mg of TKI258 free base. The inactive ingredients for the TKI258 capsules are pregelatanized starch, colloidal silicon dioxide, microcrystalline cellulose , and magnesium stearate. The capsules are stored in a high -density 
polyethylene bottle. Each bottle will contain 30 capsules. The capsules should be stored between 15 to 30 °C (59 to 86 °F) in a secured, limited access area until required. 
 1.[ADDRESS_812339] been observed in a variety of nonclinical 
models representing solid and hematological cancers. The in vivo effects of TKI258 
were shown to be a result of its dual mechanisms of action: antiangiogenesis and direct antitumor activity. Inhibition of angiogenesis (through in activation of VEGFR, 
PDGFRβ, and FGFR on stroma and endothelium) was demonstrated by a reduction in hemoglobin concentration in subcutaneous Matrigel plugs, as well as reduced microvessel density in tumor xenografts after administration of TKI258. Direct inhibition of RTK activation on tumor cells (PDGFRβ, FLT3, and FGFR 1 & 3) was 
confirmed by a reduction in phosphorylation of these target RTKs, as well as signaling pathway components (ERK, STAT5, and AKT) in tumor xenografts (Chase et al. 2007) . Target in hibition was observed for as long as [ADDRESS_812340], and ovarian, TKI258 had anti-tumor effects on both small and large established tumor xenografts.  
 TKI258 has high oral bioavailability in mice, rats, and monkeys, and moderate bioavailability in dogs. The agent clears rapi[INVESTIGATOR_612732] n t1/2 
of about 3 hours in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. TKI258 distributes widely to tissues, including tumor xenografts (in mice). After multiple dosing, TKI258 demonstrates a time dependent reduction in plasma exposure in rats, dogs, and monkeys, but not mice. Two major metabolites were identified in vitro and in vivo in 
Protocol 2008- 0510

 plasma from mice, rats, and monkeys. The N desmethyl TKI258 metabolite 
(generated by [CONTACT_097]3A4) has in vitro potency similar to that of TKI258, whereas the N 
oxide TKI258 metabolite (generated by [CONTACT_15003]) is 5 to 10 fold less active.   
TKI258 is metabolized by a number of enzymes, including CYP2C8, CYP2D6, 
CYP3A4, CYP1A1/2, FMO1, FMO3, and FMO5.  Though no drug interactions have been studied clinically, drugs that inhibit or induce such enzymes may interact with 
TKI258. TKI258 demonstrated low inhibition potential (IC
50 greater than 25 µM) in 
five major human hepatic cDNA derived CYP450 isozymes and in pooled human 
hepatic microsomes (CYP 3A4, 2D6, 2C19, 2C9, 1A2), suggesting that TKI258 is unlikely to cause significant inhibitory metabolic drug drug interactions when coadministered with drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_612773]450s. The induction potential of TKI258 was evaluated in primary cultures of rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes.  TKI258 treatment was not associated with the induction of CYP2B or CYP3A protein or enzyme activity in these species.   
However, TKI258 treatment was associated with the induction of CYP1A1 and 
CYP1A2 protein and activity, as well as with the induction of UGT protein in dog, monkey and human hepatocytes. Therefore potent inhibitors/inducers of these enzymes, such as quinidine (a CYP2D6 inhibitor), fluvoxamine (CYP1A inhibitor), omeprazole (a CYP1A inducer), ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin and glibenclamide (CYP3A4 inhibitors), as well as phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_612733] (all CYP3A4 inducers), should be used with caution.  The safety of TKI258 was evaluated on a daily dosing schedule in rats, dogs, and monkeys for up to [ADDRESS_812341] level was approximately 60 mg/m², and 180 mg/m² approached the MTD after 28 days of daily dosing. The dose- limiting toxicity in all animal 
species tested was gastrointestinal irritation reflected in emesis, diarrhea, severely decreased food consumption, and severe body weight loss. There were no target organs identified for clinical monitoring other than GI irritation. At severely toxic doses, morbidity was attributed to emaciation. Comparison of plasma exposure between species for assessment of a safety margin was confounded by [CONTACT_5586]-dependent reduction in plasma exposure of TKI258 (as assessed by [CONTACT_612774]) following repeated oral administration. Therefore, body surface area-normalized dosing between species provided the most accurate prediction of safety.

 addition, inhibition of these receptors results in modulation of important downstream -
signaling pathways that are essential for tumor cell proliferation and metastasis.  
 
TKI258 inhibited angiogenesis in an FGF driven murine model of neovascularization with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 3 mg/kg/day (9 mg/m
2). Considerable 
antitumo r activity (MED 4 to 10 mg/kg/day; 12 to 30 mg/m2) was demonstrated in 
target driven tumor models. These included an AML xenograft model (MV4;11) with an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation and an FGFR3 mutated multiple myeloma model (KMS11), both cell lines with constitutively active receptor tyrosine kinases known to be essential for tumor cell proliferation. Tumor regressions, including complete responses, were observed with doses of at least 10 mg/kg/day (30 mg/m
2) against established (300 mm3) and very large tumors MV4;11 tumors (500 to 
1000 mm3). TKI258 also demonstrated tumor stasis at 50 mg/kg/day in the orthotopic 
RT112 bladder cancer model and regression at 60 mg/kg/day in the KMS11 multiple myeloma xenograft.  
 TKI258 treatment in additional oncology models of diverse tumor origin, including colon, myeloma, prostate, ovarian, lung, renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, also resulted in tumor regression, stabilization, or growth inhibition. Spontaneous liver metastases were i nhibited in a murine breast tumor model. Several 
dose scheduling studies have demonstrated similar efficacy with twice -daily, 
intermittent, or cyclic regimens compared with daily dosing in several models.  
 The biological activities of TKI258 have been determined in vivo . Inhibition of 
activity of  downstream-signaling components of the target RTKs and reduced 
receptor phosphorylation have been demonstrated. Durable inhibition of kinase activity was demonstrated for 24hr after a high single dose of TKI258.  
 
1.5.1  In Vitro pharmacology 
TKI258 is an inhibitor of type III, IV, and V receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that mediate both endothelial and tumor cell proliferation and survival. These growth factor receptors include FGFR subtypes 1, 2 and 3, three VEGFR subtypes (VEGFR 1, 2, and 3), PDGFRβ, CSF 1R, c-KIT, RET, TrkA, and FLT3. The biochemical activity against these receptors is in the low nanomolar range (IC50 = 1 to 40 nM) (Table 1-1).

RTKs belonging to other classes are either not inhibit ed or are much less responsive 
to inhibition by [CONTACT_612756]258 ( Table 1-2). For example, EGFR1, HER2, or Insulin 
Receptor (INSR) were inhibited in biochemical assays at IC50 values greater than 2.[ADDRESS_812343] other int racellular kinases 
(IC50 values greater than 1 μM). Four additional tyrosine and serine threonine kinases (Fyn, Lck, RSK2, and Nek2) had IC50 values of less than [ADDRESS_812344] roles in T -cell signaling and proliferation, RSK2 is implicated in th e 
activation of the mitogen activated kinase (MAPK) cascade and the stimulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, and Nek2 is a regulator of centrosome structure and function. 
    
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812345] a large number of cancer cell lines and primary nonmalignant cell lines in vitro ( Table 1-3). 
In a subset of cancer cell lines and in endothelial cells, proliferation was inhibited with an EC50 value less than 60 nM, consistent with their dependence on an RTK targeted by [CONTACT_612756]258; for example, t(4;14) translocation and FGFR3 activation in KMS11 cell line; expression of constitutively active FL T3 in MV4;11 cell line; 
VEGFR2 mediated proliferation in HMVEC; and c-KIT mediated proliferation in the TF 1 cell line). The EC50s for proliferation inhibition in primary norm al cell lines 
were all greater than 1 μM.

phosphorylation of VEGFR2 after 1 hour of incubation with 100 nM TKI258. There was no change in total VEGFR2 levels. Consistent with inhibition of VEGFR2, the phosphorylation of the downstream- signaling molecule ERK/MAPK was also 
inhibited significantly after 1 hour with 100 nM TKI258 ( Figure 1-4). Equivalent 
protein loading was confirmed by [CONTACT_612775], 14-3-3.  Figure 1-4 - Dose -dependent inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by [CONTACT_612756]258 (CHIR-

  IN VITRO ACTIVITY OF TKI258  IN PROSTATE TUMOR CE LLS 
Prostate cancer epi[INVESTIGATOR_612736] (FGFR1 to 4) at variable frequencies. Expression of FGFR1 and FGFR4 is most closely linked to 
prostate cancer progression, while the role of FGFR2 remains controversial. Expression of FGFRs and other TKI258 targets were assessed by [CONTACT_612776] (not shown). FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 were expressed at varying levels in prostate cell lines, with marked high expression of FGFR3 in 22RV1 cells and FGFR4 in MRI-HI-579 tumor xenograft samples. The cognate FGF ligands were also expressed, suggesting the possibility of autocrine activation of FGFR signaling. Prostate tumor cell lines and tumor xenograft samples also expressed other 
TKI258 targets such as VEGFR1 and 2, PDGFR β, and FLT3. 
 
Inhibition of FGF stimulated signaling was analyzed  by [CONTACT_612777] ( Figure 1-5). Concentrations of [ADDRESS_812346] (pERK) in 22RV1 and PC3 cells. DU145 cells

 mean tumor volume was 100 to 200 mm3. TKI258 was formulated as a solution in 
water and was administered daily by [CONTACT_16759]. Statistically significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in each study, and a minimum effective dose (MED) was determined from the dose response curve. TKI258 was also evaluated in an in vivo angiogenesis model in which Matrigel-containing FGF2 was plac ed 
subcutaneously in mice. TKI258 was administered daily for [ADDRESS_812348] potent antitumor activity of TKI2 58 (MED of 3 to 10 mg/kg/day; 9 to 30 
mg/m2/day) was observed in RTK target-driven tumor models (e.g., KMS11 FGFR3 mutant multiple myeloma and MV4;11 FLT3-ITD mutant AML). In these cases, the mutations in the target RTK are known to drive disease progression and to be associated with poor clinical prognosis.  For in vivo studies mentioned in Section 1.4.2, tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was 
calculated as % (mean tumor volume of treated group /mean tumor volume of control group)-1.

 IN VIVO ACTIVITY OF TKI258  IN PROSTATE TUMOR MO DELS  
The antitumor activity of TKI258 was evaluated in the human prostate tumor xenograft  models PC3, DU145 and 22RV1. In single agent tumor growth inhibition 
studies, TKI258 was administered at daily oral doses ranging from 10 to 100 mg/kg, with tumor growth inhibition seen at doses above 20 mg/kg. In general TKI258 was well tolerated at the lower doses. Daily dosing at 100 mg/kg incurred significant body weight loss requiring cessation of dosing in most studies.  Tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) determined from several studies in DU145, PC3 or 22RV1 is summarized in Figure 1-8. In these studies, subcutaneous DU145, PC3 or 
22RV1 human prostate tumors in male nude mice (300-500 mm3) were treated with vehicle (p.o. daily x 15- 21 days) or TKI258 (p.o., daily x 21 days) at the indicated doses. Data represent mean tumor growth inhibition compi[INVESTIGATOR_612737], with n = 10 mice/group/study. 
  
 
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812349] of TKI258 in combination with Taxotere (docetaxel) was evaluated in the 
DU145 and 22RV1 tumor models. Suboptimal doses of single agents were used in these studies in order to reveal potential combination effects.  In the DU145 model, mice treated with a combination of TKI258 and Taxotere showed substantially greater tumor inhibition (> 86% TGI) compared to single agent TKI258 (60% TGI) or Taxotere (47 or 69% TGI) treatment at the end of 3 weeks (Figure 1-9). Tumor shrinkage occurred by [CONTACT_4475] 18 in response to combined treatment 
with a response greater than either agent alone. The durability of response of was also evident from the analyses of tumor growth delay (to 1500mm
3), where, combination 
of TKI258 and Taxotere not only significantly suppressed tumor growth but also increased growth delay of the tumors (TKI258 + Taxotere >37days vs. TKI258 = 8 days or Taxotere = 15 days. Maximum average body weight loss in the groups treated with TKI258 ranged from 7-10%, while in the Taxotere monotherapy groups t he 
maximum body weight loss was 10% at the lower dose and 20% at the higher dose. The combinations of Taxotere and TKI258 were relatively well-tolerated with no more than 10% maximum average body weight loss.

TKI258 was also evaluated in combination with Taxotere in the androgen- receptor 
positive 22RV1 prostate xenograft model. Combination therapy of TKI258 (40 
mg/kg) and Taxo tere (20 or 30 mg/kg) produced pronounced tumor inhibition and 
delayed time to tumor regrowth compared to monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (> 98% inhibition; p<0.001 vs. vehicle; see Figure 1-10). In this study TKI258 was well tolerated as 
monotherapy, with average body weight loss of 0 and 2 % respectively for the 30 and 40 mg/kg groups. In the Taxotere monotherapy group’s maximal body weight loss was 2 and 5%, respectively for the 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg groups. In the combination group’s  maximal average body weight loss ranged from 5 to 7 %.

TKI25 8 and Taxotere on total serum PSA levels in tumor- bearing nude mice ( Figure 
1-11). Basal levels of total serum PSA were undetectable in naïve, non- tumored male 
mice. The mean total PSA level was 0.67 ng/ml in serum of vehicle -treated mice 
bearing 22RV1 tumors of approximately 2cm3. Treatment with TKI258 at 20 or 40 
mg/kg produced a dose-dependent decrease of total serum PSA levels, with statistically significant inhibition in total PSA observed with 40 mg/kg (0.07 ng/ml vs. vehicle or Taxotere; p<0.001). Taxotere therapy (30 mg/kg) did not change total serum PSA levels compared to vehicle treatment (p>0.05). Substantial reduction in total PSA levels was observed with combined TKI258 and Taxotere therapy (p<0.001 vs vehicle or single agents). The decrease in total serum PSA levels with combination therapy correlated well with tumor growth inhibition (see Figure 1-11).

1.5.3  Safety Pharmacology  
An in vitro HERG assay and in vivo monkey safety pharmacology studies were 
performed and described below. Additional cardiovascular safety measurements were part of the GLP dog study [Study No. N103753]. There was no effect on 
cardiovascular parameters during 28 days of dosing in the dog. A GLP oral safety pharmacology study in rats was also performed to evaluate effects on CNS and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] [Study No. 0770153]. TKI258 at 100 mg/kg did not have any effects on CNS  functional observation battery (FOB) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. 
 Effects on HERG were evaluated in GLP [Study No. SPH03-029] “Effects of CHIR-
258LC on HERG Tail Current Recorded from Stably Transfected HEK293 Cells” (Table 1-12) . The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of TKI258 on the 
human ether- a go-go-related gene (HERG) -encoded channel tail current recorded 
from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably transfected with HERG

 complementary DNA. TKI258 was tested at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 μM along with a 
positive control (E-4031) previously validated in the assay. Single cells were continuously exposed in the bath solutions to TKI258, the positive control or vehicle, for the duration of the measurements. The concentration- response curve was fit with a 
sigmoidal function. The IC25 and IC50 values were estimated from the best- fit 
results. No statistically significant inhibition in HERG tail current was observed at concentrations below 1 μm. The IC25 and IC50 values were 2.5 and 6.6 μM, respectively. The positive control used produced an 84% decrease in tail current at 
100 nM. 
 
Table 1-12 - In vitro safety pharmacology studies 
 
 
In GLP [Study No. UBAW-0200] “A Cardiovascular Safety Study of CHIR154258 
Administered to Naïve Telemetered Cynomo lgus Monkeys”, a group of telemetered 
cynomolgus monkeys, 3 per sex, received single escalating oral gavage doses of vehicle and 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg (370, 1222, and 3700 mg/m2) TKI258 (Table 1-
13). Doses were escalated weekly. The dose levels chosen for  this study were at or 
above dose levels that produced lethality in the multiple daily dose GLP monkey study. Monkeys were monitored for changes in heart rate, blood pressures (systolic, diastolic, and mean), body temperature, and electrocardiogram paramet ers 1.[ADDRESS_812351] dosing.  Emesis occurred with a dose dependent increase in frequency and duration starting at ≥ 100 mg/kg. Heart rates were decreased in all animals (10 to 30 bpm) following treatment with TKI258 at all dose levels compared with vehicle administration beginning [ADDRESS_812352] dose administration. This response was not dose dependent and was similar at all 3 dose levels. Several animals demonstrated an increase in mean arterial blood pressure during the period of decreased heart rate. One of the six treated anima ls had a potentially biologically significant prolongation of 
QTc interval (22 to 39 msec) at each dose of CHIR-258LC. This finding occurred within a very narrow time period at night. This particular animal had wide variations in heart rate making QTc inte rval determination difficult to interpret. The relevance 
of these findings at such high single dose levels compared to tolerated multiple doses at 5 mg/kg (60 mg/m2) in the monkey is not known. Although decreased heart rates were observed, this observation did not appear to be dose related. Cardiac arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, or quantitative ECG abnormalities (including QTc prolongation) were not consistently observed following the oral administration of TKI258 at any of the dose levels tested. 
 
   
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812353] concentrations of the radiolabel observed in the harderian gland, liver, renal medulla, spleen, adrenal gland, and kidneys (30 to 100 fold higher than plasma). The radioactivity in both tissues and plasma peaked within 4 hours after dosing and was significantly lower at 24 hours after dosing.  In murine xenograft models, oral dosing with TKI258 demonstrated extensive distribution to tumors relative to plasma or normal tissue (up to 200 fold higher at 48 hours after cessation of dosing). Plasma or normal tissue concentrations declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_612738], suggesting that TKI258 may be preferentially retained in tumors. TKI258 was highly bound to plasma proteins (90.8% to 98.2%), mainly to albumin, and its binding was independent of concentration (0.5 to 10 μg/mL) and gender in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human plasma.  The blood cell to plasma partitioning ratios of TKI258 ranged from 1.45 to 2.64 and were, in general, independent of concentration and gender in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human blood. These results indicate that the majority of TKI258 in blood was associated with blood cells. 
 
1. 5.6 Metabolism 
TKI258 is metabolized mainly by [CONTACT_097]1A1/2 and FMO. FMO is not readily induced or inhibited by [CONTACT_612779], therefore the drug-drug interactions between TKI258 and FMO inducers/inhibitors are of lesser concern. To a lesser extent, TKI258 could be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 enzymes.  Though no drug interactions have been studied clinically, drugs that inhibit (ciprofloxacin, clinafloxacin, enoxacin, fluvoxamine, oltipraz, propranolol, rofecoxib, thiabendazole, and zafirlukast) or induce CYP1A1/2 (omeprazole and tobacco) may interact with TKI258 and should be used with caution. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] I
N VITRO STUDIES  
The induction potential of TKI258 was evaluated in primary cultures of rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes. TKI258 treatment was not associated with the induction of CYP2B or CYP3A protein or enzyme activity in these species. However, TKI25 8 treatment was associated with the induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 
protein and activity, as well as with the induction of UGT protein in dog, monkey and human hepatocytes.  In vitro, TKI258 has a potential to induce CYP1A2 activity 2- to 14-fold, as well a s 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity to a lesser extent (< 3- to 4-fold). Therefore, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates as listed below should also be used with caution: 
Protocol 2008- 0510  
June 1 2, 2012  
Page 32 
 Page 32 of 72 
 • CYP1A2 substrates: clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], cyclobenzaprine, imipramine, mexiletine, naproxen, 
riluzo le, tacrine, and theophylline. 
• CYP2C9 substrates: losartan, irbesartan, diclofenac, ibuprofen, pi[INVESTIGATOR_18234], tolbutamide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130], celecoxib, fluvastatin, naproxen, phenytoin, rosiglitazone, sulfamethoxazole, tamoxifen, tolbutamide, torsemide, and warfarin. • CYP2C19 substrates: diazepam, phenytoin, phenobarbital, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, amitriptyline, clomipramine, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], cyclophosphamide and progesterone.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] I
N VIVO STUDIES  
After a single intravenous or oral dose of radiolabeled (14C ) TKI258 to rats and monkeys ( [Studies No. 6549 177] and [-178] , respectively), unchanged TKI258 and 
its N des methyl metabolite accounted for most of the radioactivity in plasma.  In 
other studies, N desmethyl TKI258 and TKI258 N oxide were the two major metabolites detected in plasma from mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys following single or multiple oral doses of TKI258. The ratios of plasma concentrations of each of these two metabolites to unchanged TKI258 were comparable after single and multiple dose administration in each species examined, suggesting that the time dependent kinetics (observed in rats, dogs, and monkeys) is likely independent of the formation of these two metabolites. An additional mono- hydroxy metabolite was 
found in plasma and urine samples from dogs after a single oral dose. The proportion of this metabolite relative to unchanged TKI258 increased after multiple dosing suggesting possible induction of metabolic enzymes responsible for the formation of the hydroxylated metabolite. Such a hydroxy metabolite was not identified in plasma, urine, and feces from rats, or in plasma and urine from monkeys.  Livers collected from rats treated with once daily oral doses of 30, 50, or 80 mg/kg/day  TKI258 for [ADDRESS_812354] (3.7 to 4.7 fold) increase in 
CYP1A1/2 and CYP2A1 activities compared to those from control animals. However, about a 9 to 17 fold increase in uridyl glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) activity was observed in the treated animals compared to those in the control group. In a similar study in monkeys, livers collected after multiple oral dosing with TKI258 (5, 30, or 80 mg/kg/day; [Study No. 02 3008]) demonstrated up to a 15 fold increase in CYP450 1A1/[ADDRESS_812355] 3.2 fold increase in thyroxine glucuronidation compared to those from control animals.  In another study, significant differences were observed in the metabolic profiles of rat bile after single oral dose of TKI258 compared to that after multiple oral doses. After a single oral dose (20 mg/kg), unchanged parent, the N desmethyl (minor), and the N oxide (major) metabolites were detected in the rat bile. After multiple dosing (20 mg/kg/day for 7 days), several conjugated metabolites, including conjugated products of hydroxylated TKI258, were observed. It is noteworthy that the mono hydroxylated metabolite or the conjugated metabolites were not identified in plasma, urine, and feces from rats.  
 
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812356]. However, after multiple oral dosing, the metabolism of TKI258 increases, possibly due to induction of metabolic enzymes responsible for the formation of the hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites. Such an increase in the metabolic rate may explain the time dependent reduction in TKI258 exposure following repeated oral dosing. 
  1.6 Human studies  
All data presented in this section  are preliminary. All clinical studies described in this 
TKI258 (dovitinib) Investigator’s Brochure (edition 8) have been designed and implemented  in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good 
Clinical Practice, with  applicable local regulations,  and with the ethical principles 
described in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
Description and status of clinical studies with TKI258 TKI258 is being studied as a single agent in ten Phase I and three Phase II clinical trials  designed to characterize safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics (PD),  and anti- tumor activity.  
 Table [ADDRESS_812357] received single agent TKI258. Among them, 35 patients (advanced solid tumors) were treated in study 2101 (dose

Table 1-[ADDRESS_812358] commonly reported adverse 
events (AEs)  regardless of relationship to TKI258 treatment, which are 
defined as events that occurred in ≥ 10% of the patients who received TKI258 based on AE data in the cl inical database as of the [ADDRESS_812359] commonly reported non- laboratory AEs were nausea,  
fatigue/asthenia, diarrhea,  vomiting and anorexia/decreased appetite for all 3 
data groups (continuous daily dosing, global 5 days on/2 days off, and Japanese 5 days on/2 days off (study 1101)). Commonly reported AEs were reversible and manageable; most were mild or moderate in severity  
(CTCAE grade 1 or 2).

 1.7.2  CTCAE grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events regardless of study drug 
relationship (grea ter than or equal to  2%)  
 
The majority of these events were grade 3 across all dosing regimens. 
In the continuous dosing regimen studies, grade 4 events included 5 cases of fatigue, 2 cases  of pyrexia, 1 case of deep vein thrombosis, 5 cases of 
pulmonary e mbolism, 2 cases of neutropenic sepsis, and 1 case of pain in 
extremity.  In the global 5 days on/2 days off dosing regimen studies, grade 4 
events included 3 cases of pumonary embolism and 1 case of stomatitis.  In the 
Japanese 5 days on/2 days off dosing regimen study (1101), there were no grade 4  events for these AEs.  
 
 
1.7.3 Laboratory Data  
The majority of the hematology laboratory abnormalities were grade 1 or 2 events across all  dosing regimens. In continuous dosing regimen studies, five 
patients (3.5%) had grade 4  hemoglobin values, 7 patients (7.4%) had grade 4 
ANC values, 19 patients (14.6%) had grade 4 platelet counts, and 9 patients (6.9%) had grade 4 WBC values during study participation.  The relatively higher incidence rate of grade 3/4 hematolog y abnormalities in 
the continuous daily dosing regimen was mainly due to acute myeloid leukemia (study 2102) and multiple myeloma (studies 2103 and 2104) patients. In global 5 days on/2 days off dosing regimen studies, 2 patients (1.3%) had grade 4 ANC values, 1 patient (0.5%) had grade 4 platelet counts, and no patients had grade 4 hemoglobin or white blood counts during study participation. Also, one patient (4.5%) had grade 4 hemoglobin in the Japanese 5 days on/2 days off dosing regimen study and no patients had grade 4 ANC, platelet or white blood cell counts during study participation.  The majority of the chemistry laboratory abnormalities were also grade 1 or 2 events across  all dosing regimens. In continuous dosing regimen studies, only 
1 patient (0.7%) had grade 4 creatinine value and 2 patients (1.6%) had grade 4 triglyceride values. There were no grade 4  abnormalites observed in 
cholesterol  or amylase laboratory values in the continuous dosing regimen. In 
global 5 days on/2 days off dosing regimen studies, 2 patients (1.2%) had grade 4  triglycerides and 2 patients (1.1%) had grade [ADDRESS_812360], 
ALT, total bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. In global 5 days on/[ADDRESS_812361] laboratory values; 
Protocol 2008- 0510

 Page 42 of 72 
 however, 1 patient (0.5%) had a grade 4 ALT value, 1 patient (1.1%) had a 
grade 4 total  bilirubin value, and 3 patients (1.6%) had a grade 4 alkaline 
phosphatase values. In the Japanese 5 days on/2 days off dosing regimen study, only 1 patient (4.5%) had grade [ADDRESS_812362], ALT or al kaline  phosphatase values during 
study participation.  
 
1.7.4  Hepatic dysfunction as defined by [CONTACT_612780] 10 September 2010 data cut- off, there were 12 cases with hepatic 
dysfunction, defined as total bilirubin >2X ULN and AST or ALT > 3X ULN. From the [COMPANY_001]  perspective, in 6 of these cases, data available do not 
provide any evidence supporting a causal relationship of hepatic dysfunction and dovitinib treatment. The cause of liver injury in these patients was progression of underlyin g metastatic liver disease, with signs suggestive of  
pre-existing cholestatic liver injury in 5 out of 6 patients.  
 For 6 out of 12 patients, a contribution of dovitinib treatment to liver injury cannot be excluded, based on time relationship of onset or worsening of elevated enzyme activities to  study treatment and improvement of enzyme 
activities after stop/interruption of treatment.  
 None of the above cases qualifies as a “Hy’s law” case ( Rueben 2004). All of 
the cases  demonstrate a clear cholestatic com ponent, only 2 of 12 cases would 
qualify as mixed type  cholestatic/hepatocellular injury, the remaining 10 cases 
are of cholestatic injury type.  Moreover, factors confounding any qualification 
as “Hy’s law” were present in all 12 patients  in terms of under lying disease 
(malignancy, 10 of 11 solid tumor cases with liver metastases  at baseline), and 
in [ADDRESS_812363] cancer patient with liver, bone and lymph nodes metastases was assessed by [CONTACT_612781]- related cholestatic 
hepatic injury leading to death. Confounding factors were present in this fatal case including liver metastases  and concomitant medications. Of the 
remaining 11 patients: 1 patient remains on s tudy, for 1  patient there is no 
available survival data, and in 9 patients, the deaths were due to disease progression.

Treatment cycle  
A cycle is arbitrary defined as 28 days (4 weeks) for the purposes of scheduling 
procedures and evaluations.  
A complete treatment cycle is defined as 28 days or 4 weeks.  
• TKI258 if given on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26 (5 days on/2 days off) of each 
cycle.  
• The first administration of TKI258 defines Day [ADDRESS_812377] day of a complete cycle is Day 28.  
 
 
5.2  Permitted study drug adjustments  
5.2.1. Dosing schedule. 
The decisi on whether to continue with study drug should be based on individual 
circumstances and the physician’s judgment that continuation is in the patient’s best 
interest. If the study treatment is interrupted, because of its toxicity or a lack a compliance to th e treatment schedule by [CONTACT_102], the following guidelines should 
apply. 
• If TKI258 is taken on a “rest days”, then the patient will resume the original 5 days on/2 days off schedule starting with the next day of dosing as follows:  if the patient takes an additional dose on Day 6, then the patient will rest on Day 7 and 
start the 5 days on/2 days off dosing on Day 1; if patient takes a dose on Day 7, then the patient will skip Day 1 of the 5 days on/2 days off and start dosing the following day (Day 2). If patient takes a dose on Day 6 and 7, then the patient will skip Day 1 and 2 of the 5 days on/2 days off and start dosing the following day 
(Day 3).  
• If the patient missed TKI258 dose on Day 1, 2, [ADDRESS_812378] on Days 6 and 7 
• If the patient missed TKI258 dose on Day 5, 6, 7, he should rest on Days [ADDRESS_812379] of the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
 
5.2.2 Dosing modifications.  
For patients who are unable to tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule of 
TKI258, dose reduction is  permitted  to a minimum of 300 mg  Table 5 -1:

5.[ADDRESS_812405] be instructed not to take additional medications including over-
the-counter products and herbal/alternative medications during the study without 
prior consultation with the investigator. It is imp ortant to avoid concomitant 
medications that are known to cause hepatotoxicity.  
 Oral contraceptives are generally metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/2C9, and act also as a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2, therefore should not be used. Thus, patients who are sexually acti ve and are using oral contraceptives as a method of contraception, should 
change to two highly effective contraceptive methods during the study participation.  Permitted treatments during the study include, but are not limited to the following:  
 
•  Pain me dication to allow the patient to be as comfortable as possible 
•  Localized radiotherapy and treatment with bisphosphonates for pre- existing, 
painful bone metastases is permitted only if evidence of radiological progression 
is not present. Treatment with b isphosphonates must begin before the study 
treatment is initiated.  
• Nutritional support or appetite stimulants (e.g. megestrol)  
•  Oxygen therapy and blood products or transfusions •  Prophylactic anti- emetics are allowed for patients who, at the discretion  of the 
investigator, have experienced ≥ grade 1 nausea or vomiting. 
•  Hematopoietic growth factors should be used according to the guidelines 
established by [CONTACT_540845] (ASCO) or as dictated

•  The administration of anticoagulation and antiaggregation agents (e.g. 
eptifibatide, epoprosterol, prasugrel, dipyridamole, fondaparinix) should be 
allowed except prasugrel, due t o its potential drug- drug interaction with either 
sorafenib or TKI258. Prasugrel is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 and CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_2750]2C9 and CYP2C19. Co- administration 
of prasugrel with sorafenib could increase the systemic exposure of parsugrel, since sorafenib could inhibit CYP2B6. In addition, in vitro study demonstrated that TKI258 is an inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, co- administration of 
TKI258 with parsugrel is likely to reduce the exposure of parsugrel. For oral anticoa gulants, the upper limit of INR is < 1.5. 
 The following concomitant treatments are not allowed during the study:  •  Concurrent use of isoniazid, labetolol, trovafloxacin, tolcapone, and felbamate are 
not permitted, since alternative less hepatotoxic drug s are available to use.  
•  Concurrent use of other investigational drugs is not permitted. •  The administration of other antineoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, hormone 
therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, monoclonal antibodies and radiation therapy) is not permitted. Patients requiring radiation therapy after the start of the study are considered as having progression of disease and must discontinue study treatment.  
 
 
5.3.2 Concomitant therapy with the following is prohibited: 
 Chemotherapy  
 Multifr action radiation therapy  
 Immunotherapy 
 Radiopharmaceuticals such as strontium (89Sr) or samarium (153Sm) 
 
Patients who require the use of any of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612741]-treatment, entered into long- term follow -up for overall survival 
assessments.  Patients who discontinue from the study will be followed for safety outcomes for 30 days following the patient’s last dose or until the patient

Adverse events including laboratory adverse events deemed clinically significant by 
[CONTACT_612788] ( NCI CTCAE), version 
3.0.  
 
6.5.2 Definition of an Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any reaction, side effect, or other untoward medical 
occurrence, regardless of relationship to study drug t hat occurs any time from the 
beginning of the first study dose administration until the final study visit or early termination visit.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.   
Protocol 2008- [ADDRESS_812412] dose 
should be followed-up to deter mine if any new or ongoing drug- related AE or any 
SAE regardless of relationship to study drug exists.  Follow-up could be conducted by [CONTACT_612789].  
 
6.5.4 Severity  
Adverse- event severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE.  The 
severity assessment for a clinical AE should be completed using the NCI CTCAE  
(version 3.0).  
 
6.5.5 Relationship  
A determination should be made by [CONTACT_612790] (if any) between an AE and the study drug.  A causal relationship is present if a determination is made that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]. 
 
6.5.6 Expectedness  
 
Management of Symptoms Related to Castration  
Treatm ent with androgens, estrogens, and progestin to control hot flushes is not 
allowed.  Antidepressants are permitted for the management of hot flashes.  Selective serotinin re uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also permitted.  
 
Management of Persistent and Refract ory Toxicity  
Utilizing the  NCI CTCAE (v ersion 3.0), events which are moderate and interfere with 
function that  are not consistent with a patient’s medical history, and are  refractory to 
medical treatment , should be investigated carefully to ensure that no other etiology is 
present.  Study drug will be held for any toxicity events deemed definitely, probably, 
or possibly drug- related  (such as diarrhea, hypertension, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
dizziness ) and that are greater than grade 2.  Drug will be held until severity is 
reduced to Grade 1 or less and then resumed daily dosing with a dose reduction of 1 capsule as outlined in section 5.2.  Up to 2 dose reductions, ie, 5→4 capsules , 4→3 
capsules, are allowed  as outlined in section 5.2. Patients with toxicities  that fail to 
resolve to < Grade 1 within 21 days  will be taken off study.   
 
Management of All Other Toxicities  
Other toxicities may occur.  Supportive care should be prescribed as needed.  They may also be prescribed prophylactically to prevent toxicity fr om developi[INVESTIGATOR_612743].  The examples include anti -emetics for nausea/vomiting, analgesics for 
pain, antipyretics for fever and antidiarrheals for diarrhea.  Because long- term

 Page 58 of 72 
 androgen deprivation may lead to metabolic diseases, such as glucose intoler ance, 
hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and anemia, appropriate medication  may be 
prescribed.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values will be only be captured as adverse events if deemed “clinically significant” by [CONTACT_093].  
  
6.5.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
The results of all laboratory tests required by [CONTACT_612791]’s medical record .  All clinically important abnormal laboratory tests occurring 
during the study will be repeated at appropriate intervals until they return either to baseline or to a level deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_612792] a diagnosis that explains them is made.   
 The criteria for determining whether an abnormal laboratory test result should be reported as an adverse event are as follows:  
 
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or 
3. Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or 
4. Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE, and/or 
5. Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_4687]. 
  *Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above 
conditions, does not meet Condition [ADDRESS_812413] result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event, even if it did meet one of the abo ve conditions except for 
Condition 4. 
 
6.7 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
A serious adverse event is – any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the 
adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_457971] 2008- 0510  
June 1 2, 2012

 Page 59 of 72 
 • A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.

8.0 WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY TREATMENT  
The investigator may withdraw a pat ient from study treatment phase for any of the following 
reasons:  
 Dosing noncompliance:  Study drug administration and dosing compliance will be assessed on Week 4 visit.  A count of study drug will be conducted during this visit 
and patient dosing compliance will be assessed.  If dosing compliance is not 100% in the absence of toxicity, patient should be re-instructed regarding proper dosing procedures and continue in the study.  Subsequent dosing compliance procedure will be conducted at each study visit.  If a patient misses 14 or more doses within a single 
28-day cycle, the patient should be discontinued from the study treatment phase.  All End-of-Study treatment procedures should be followed.  The patient will be followed 
for survival. 
 Sustained Side Ef fects:  Patients  who have sustained toxicities, such as described in 
6.5.6, which does not return to NCI CTCAE (version 3.0) Grade 1 or less with appropriate medical management , should be discont inued from the study treatment 
phase.  All End-of- Study treat ment procedures should be conducted.  The patient will 
be followed for survival. 
 Initiation of new anti cancer treatment:  Patients  will be discontinued from the study 
treatment when investigator, in his or her judgment, determines new treatment for 
Protocol 2008- 0510  
June 1 2, 2012  
Page 67 
 
 Page 67 of 72 
 prostat e cancer is warranted.  All End -of-Study treatment procedures should be 
conducted and the patient will be followed for survival. 
 Administration of prohibited medications:  The patient will be discontinued from the 
protocol treatment when prohibited drug is administered.  All End of Study treatment procedures should be conducted.  The patient will be followed for survival.  Supportive care medications are permitted with their use following institutional guidelines.  For patients who did not undergo orchiectomy, concurrent treatment with LHRH analogue is mandatory and must be recorded.  The concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy, including cytotoxic, hormonal (except LHRH agonists), or immunotherapy is prohibited during study treatment phase.  Use of other investigational drug therapy for any reason is prohibited 
 Patient’s withdraws consent.  In this event, the reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented A patient’s decision to take part in the study is voluntary and he may choose not to take part in the study or to stop taking part at anytime.  If he chooses not to take part or to stop at anytime, it will not affect his future medical care or medical benefits . 
  
9.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
 
During and/or after completion of the study, qual ity assurance officers named by [CONTACT_612799]- site audits.  The investigators will be 
expected to cooperate with any audit and to provide assistance and documentation (including source data) as requested . 
 [COMPANY_001] representatives are responsible for contact[CONTACT_125575], upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that patie nt confidentiality is 
respected.  
 
10.0 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
This is a phase IIA activity trial of TKI258 for treatment of castrate resistant prostate cancer with skeletal metastases . The two primary outcomes are survival time and early response as 
characterized by a drop in PSA as defined by [CONTACT_612800]. Based on historical mean survival time 8 months, a mean survival time on average > 10 months with TKI258 would be considered promising evidence of anti- disease activity.  The planned samp le size is 
40 patients, with an anticipated accrual rate of 3 patients per month. Based on historical experience using carefully selected candidates with evidence for iliac involvement on bone scan, we anticipate that ~60% of patients will have positive biopsies. No early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612749]- epi[INVESTIGATOR_612723] (SE -pathway) will be related to 
clinical benefit.  Consequently, it may be the case that PSA does not drop but survival time is prolonged due to inhibition of disease progression by [CONTACT_612756]258. Given the short survival time of these patients and anticipated accrual rate of 3 patients per month, it also will not be 
Protocol 2008- 0510  
June 1 2, 2012  
Page 68 
 
 Page 68 of 72 
 feasible to implement an  early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612724].  Based on 
an historical rate of 20% grade [ADDRESS_812427] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_612750] (1998) will be used to monitor toxicity. Unadjusted survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier (1958) and  the effects of the following four potential prognostic covariates : Inhibition of FGF signaling by [CONTACT_612754] 4 weeks, 
modulation of the bone markers (a) urinary NTX and (b) bone specific alkaline phosphatase, and baseline signature [CONTACT_612807] R -1, FGF R- 3 and FGF 9 on 
Prob(PSA response) will be estimated using logistic regression, and on survival time will be estimated using the Cox model or an appropriate time- to-event regressio n model. 
 Preliminaries : This is a phase IIA activity trial of TKI258 for treatment of castrate resistant 
prostate cancer with skeletal metastases . The two primary outcomes are survival time and 
early response as characterized by a drop in PSA as defined b y working group criteria (25 ).   
 Historical Experience and Goals : Based on the historical experience in which the mean 
survival time was 8 months, under a Bayesian model we assume that the unadjusted mean survival time with TKI258 follows an uninformative inverse gamma with mean 8 and variance 1000, equivalently with scale parameter 2.064 and shape parameter 8.512, denoted mE ~ IG(2.064, 8.512).  A mean survival time on average > 10 months would be considered promising evidence of anti- disease activity.  F ormally, assuming that the historical mean 
survival mH ~ IG(52, 400),  TKI258 will be considered promising if, based on the data from the trial,  Pr(mE >  mH | data ) > .95. The planned sample size is 40 patients, with an anticipated accrual rate of 3 pati ents per month.  In addition, the relationships between 
several potential prognostic covariates and the above clinical outcomes will be explored, as described below.  
 
Monitoring Rules: No early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612751]- epi[INVESTIGATOR_612727] (SE- pathway) will be related to clinical benefit.  Consequently, it may be the case 
that PSA does not drop but survival time is prolonged due to inhibition of disease progression by [CONTACT_612756]258. Given the short survival time of these patients and anticipated accrual rate of [ADDRESS_812428] orical rate of 20% grade 
[ADDRESS_812429] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it will be assumed that p = Prob(grade 3 or 4 with TKI258) follows a beta prior with parameters (.20, .80).  Using the method of Thall and Suung (26), based on the observed toxicity data, ac crual to the trial will be stopped early if 
Pr(p > .20 | data)  > .95, with this rule applied after successive cohorts f size 5.  This rule says to stop the trial if [# patients with a grade 3 or 4 toxicity]/[# patients evaluated] is greater than or equal to 3/5, 5/10, 7/15, 8/20, 9/25, 11/30, 12/35. The operating characteristics of this rule are summarized in the following table.

Data Analysis. If the data on the 40 patients yield a sample mean of 10 months (the targeted 
25% improvement) based on total follow-up time 400 months (all 40 deaths observed) then the posterior of m would be IG(42.064, 408.512), which has mean 9.95 months and posterior 95% credible interval 7.33 – 13.4 months.  Similarly, if 35 deaths are observed with 5 death times administratively censored and total follow -up 460 months at the final analysis then the 
posterior of m would be IG(37.064, 468.512), ), which has mean 13 months and posterior 95% credible interval 9.39 – 17.95 months.  Unadjusted survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier (27).  The effects of the following four potential prognostic covariates on Prob(PSA response) will be estimated using logistic regression (28), and on 
survival time will be estimated using the Cox model or, if the proportional hazards assumption is not satisfied, using an appropriate time- to-event regression model chosen 
based on preliminary goodness-of- fit analyses of the data (29).  Each of the following 
covariates is a binary indicator.  
 
1. Inhibition of FGF signaling by [CONTACT_612754] 4 weeks. 
 2. Modulation of the bone markers (a) urinary NTX and (b) bone specific alkaline phosphatase  
 3. Baseline signature [CONTACT_612809] R -1, FGF R-3 and FGF 9. 
 
Time of disease progression if defined by [CONTACT_612801]:  Three 
consecutive PSA elevations above nadir or baseline are required.  Each increment in PSA 
should be a minimum of 1 ng/ml and at least [ADDRESS_812430] 25% above the nadir or baseline.  Given that increments in PSA do 
not always represent treatment failure, particularly when novel agents with uncertain effects on PSA levels are being evaluated, clinical and radiological correlation is recommended at the discretion of the treati ng physician.  In patients with PSA progression alone without 
clinical or radiological evidence of disease progression, continued therapy on study is at the discretion of the treating physician in consultation with the principal investigator.

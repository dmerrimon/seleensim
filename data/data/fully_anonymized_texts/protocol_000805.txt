Thi
s study aims to determine the average level of physical activity using average step counts
and daily MET min-1 following vaginal and cesarean delivery through use of Actigraph
GT3X (a fitness tracker) .

there is a paucity of literature looking into the implementation of enhanced recovery after 
surgery (ERAS) for patients undergoing this type of surgery. ERAS protocols have shown to improve recovery from surgery, decreasing complication and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].
[ADDRESS_554386] undesirable side effects such as nausea, vomiting, sedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], constipation and urinary retention. All of these adverse effects (AEs) may lead to complications or increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. 
To t
he best of our knowledge the average level of physical activity (PA) of parturients 
recovering from a cesarean delivery or after a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (NSVD) remains unknown. Taking in consideration that parturients are in a hypercoagulable state and that obstetric ve nous thromboembolism (VT) is one of the most common causes of maternal 
morbidity and mortality, ambulation is of utmost importance to anesthesiologists as well as obstetricians.

Title: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]: To c ompar e physical activity after a normal spontaneous or cesarean delivery by [CONTACT_2363] a Actigraph GT3X  
[ADDRESS_554388] designed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_437513]. Patients having a normal 
spontaneous vaginal delivery will serve as our control group. These patients are going through 
the same physiologyic changes that their counterparts (CD patients) are going through, the only 
difference being the stress of surgery in the CD group.The use of Fitness trackers (i.e Fitbit(R), Actigraph GT3X +) has been used to measure and promote physical activity in a cardiac rehabilitation population, as well as in parturients self -identified as inactive.
5,6 We intend to use 
the Actigraph GT3X+ to measure the level of physical activity of 50 parturients ([ADDRESS_554389] CD). The information obtained, we expect, will help us tailor the anesthetic/analgesic 
management of parturients in such a way that promotes early ambulation and recovery.
 We 
estimate that we need approximately a total of 50 patients, 25 per group to assess if there is a 
difference in the level of PA between parturients after a NSVD or CD. We will aim to recruit 60 patients per group to account for missing data, protocol violations, equipment malfunction or patients drop out s.

s will be a  multicenter  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], prospective study aimed at measuring the physical activity 
(PA) of A merican Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification I and II women aged 
18 years and older, after a normal spontaneous vaginal (NSVD) or cesarean delivery (CD). 
Subjects will be ASA I and II women aged [ADDRESS_554390] had either 
a NSVD or CD (under neuraxial anesthesia). After delivery, and assuring that mother and 
baby [CONTACT_437515] , patients will be approached by a member of the study team to discuss 
the study and obtain informed consent . After obtaining informed consent , patients will be 
divided into Two (2) groups depending on the mode of delivery.  Group 1 will be NSVD 
and group 2 will be CD patients. Patients will be provided with a fitbit - based Actigraph 
GT3X + hardware, 6 hours after delivery. Patients will be evaluated every 12 hours after 
delivery for a  period of 48 hours. During these  evaluation points, pain  (visual analogue 
scores) , factors affecting mobility, and level of satisfaction with their analgesia will be 
assesed . After 48 hrs the Actigraph GT3X + will be interrogated and objective data, such 
as mean daily steps and daily MET min-1, will be obtained using the aforementioned 
software.

5 4.
1 Independent Variables or Interventions 
Independent variables: Demographic and labor data (patient age, ethnicity, height, 
weight, body mass index (BMI), gravity, parity, time of delivery, mode of anesthesia 
or analgesia, mode of delivery, post-partum analgesia (iv or po analgesia), number 
of previous CD and prior abdominal surgery).  
Inte
rventions : After obtaining informed consent , patients will be assigned to either 
the NSVD or CD group. Patients will be provided with a fitbit - based Actigraph GT3X 
+ hardware, 6 hours after delivery. Physical activity will be objectively measured
using the Actilife software and fitbit - based Actigraph GT3X + hardware . Physical
activity will be measured as mean daily steps and daily MET min-1. This data  will be
obtained at 48 hours after NSVD or CD and will be compared at the 12 hour, 24hour, 36 hour, and 48 hour time points.

1.1 Drug or Device Interventions 
The Actigraph GT3X -BT (Actigraph, [LOCATION_012], US) is an accelerometer that assesses total 
body displacement across a vertical plane and determines physical activity levels in the 
form of activity and step counts. This device has been previously validated.7 
4.
2 Dependent Variables or Outcome Measures  
Dependent variables: Factors contributing to immobility (i.e foley catheter), pain 
scores at rest and with movement will be measured using VAS scores, medications 
administered and satisfaction with analgesia will be monitored every 12 h for 48 h.  
Ou
tcome measures:  
       Primary: mean average steps and MET min-1 
      Secondary: Pain and satisfaction scores

collection form, which contains limited protected health information (patient name, MRN) will 
be kept until all data is gathered, then the form will be de- identified by [CONTACT_437516], 
saving only the subject number. All forms will be securely kept in a locked cabinet in the locked 
office of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_437514]. All digital data stored on computers will be on encrypted drives. Only study team participants will have access to the collected  data.  
There are no specific privacy issues beyond the confidentiality of study data as described above . 
Th
is will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_120448], in which objective physical activity (measured as mean 
daily steps and daily MET min-1) will be the main prim ary outcome. Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], we estimate that we need approximately a total of [ADDRESS_554398] deviation.

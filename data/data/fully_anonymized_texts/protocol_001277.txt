Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_469003] FDA-approved  therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 
the class of recombinant high-affinity, fully human monoclonal antibody of the 
IgG1/kappa isotype that selectively targets Interleukin-17A (IL-17A). In the psoriatic 
skin, IL-17A is thought to be produced by [CONTACT_374627]17 cells, neutrophils and mast 
cells. Upon activation of keratinocytes by [CONTACT_8668]-17A along with other synergistic 
inflammatory cytokines, further recruitment and activation of neutrophils, lymphocytes 
and myeloid cells eventually lead to a sustained local cutaneous inflammation that drives 
the psoriatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_374620]. This includes increase in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_207891] (acanthosis), increase in outer stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis) and 
retention of nuclei in the cornified layer (parakeratosis) (Martin 2013).
Secukinumab interferes in this pathologic process by [CONTACT_374628]-17A, 
thereby [CONTACT_43629]-17A interaction with the IL-[ADDRESS_469004] not  shown any impediment to using secukinumab administered

The approval of secukinumab (Cosentyx™) is  based on the safety and efficacy outcomes 
from 10 Phase II and Phase III studies, which included over 3,990 patients with moderate-
to-severe plaque psoriasis. This included the four pi[INVESTIGATOR_94902] – ERASURE,

[ADDRESS_469005] of biologics on the  molecular profile of psoriatic 
skin, a fundamental question that has not yet been adequately answered is: What is the 
response of specific cell populations in lesional skin to biologic treatment? A number of 
recent studies have used techniques such as RT-PCR, gene microarrays, and 
immunohistochemistry to evaluate changes in lesional skin in response to treatment with 
biologic agents (Zaba, Krueger, Hendriks, Johnston, Russell). These studies are limited by 
[CONTACT_374629], which does not permit precise quantitative analysis of 
individual cell types, and by [CONTACT_374630]-PCR 
or microarray analysis. Ideally, in order to understand the fundamental biology of how a 
biologic medication improves psoriasis, one would like to be able to isolate the different 
cell populations and study their individual characteristics.  Until now, this has not been 
possible.

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_469006] skin populations such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, 
regulatory T cells, and myeloid dendritic cells and measure the production of proteins 
such as IL-17, TNF- , IFN- , and IL-2 in parallel (Figure 1).  Because this technique is 
based on protein expression, it offers a truly functional view of the activity of cell 
populations in psoriasis, as methods using microarrays can measure only mRNA 
production, which does
 not necessarily accurately reflect protein expression (Villarino).
Moreover, we are able to perform RNA-sequencing on distinct cell populations. RNA-seq 
is a novel
 technique of quantifying gene expression in which RNA species are sequenced 
rather than hybridized as in microarrays. RNA-seq provides greater sensitivity than 
microarrays, particularly for low-expressed transcripts (Li et al). RNA-seq can also 
identify the expression of coding and noncoding transcripts that are absent on microarray 
platforms. Utilizing our innovative skin biopsy digestion protocol and cell sorting protocol 
described above, we are now able to perform RNA-seq on individual cell populations 
(Figure 2), permitting an understanding of the genetic and immunologic profile of 
individual cell types within psoriatic lesions.  Importantly, this cell type-level RNA-seq 
analysis has never previously been utilized to evaluate changes in patients undergoing 
biologic therapy.

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_469007] recently developed and optimized a new flow cytometric-based protocol for comprehensively 
studying leukocyte populations isolated from human skin (Sanchez Rodriguez et al). Traditional approaches 
have relied on culturing skin biopsy specimens for 10-[ADDRESS_469008] in vivo  differentiation and function. Using a single 4mm punch biopsy of freshly isolated human skin, 
we are now able to isolate lymphocytes and monocytes and immediately assess their functional activities in 
the absence of growth factors. We perform 15-color flow cytometry on these specimens, allowing for the 
quantification of multiple cytokine, chemokine, and cell surface and intracellular differentiation/activation 
markers at the protein level. Using this technique on 5mm skin punch biopsy specimens, we have analyzed 
the intracellular cytokine expression patterns  from T cells infiltrating lesional and non-lesional skin of a 
patient with psoriasis (shown above). This data shows increased Tregs (denoted by [CONTACT_374631]3 expression) and 
increased TNF- , IL-17 and IFN- production from T cells infiltrating lesional psoriatic plaques when 
compared to non-lesional (normal appearing) skin from the same patient. All graphs are pre-gated on live 
CD3+CD4+ T cells. Numbers indicate percentage of cells per quadrant.

RNA-sequencing. Scatter plot shows grouped Treg vs. Teff comparisons.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 2.2 Risk / Benefit Assessment
Details of the
 risk and  benefits of secukinumab are outlined in the Prescribing 
Information. Side effects of secukinumab include nasopharyngitis (11.4%), diarrhea 
(4.1%), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] (2.5%). Serious side effects include anaphylaxis 
and exacerbation of Crohn’s disease. The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_374632]/exclusion criteria, proper study design, and close clinical 
monitoring.
In regards to skin biopsy procedures, as in any surgical procedure, there are certain 
inherent risks including bleeding, post-operative  pain, infection, reactions to sutures, 
anesthetics or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], and scarring. All reasonable efforts will be made to  
minimize the possibility of these potential complications .
The benefit to subjects is that they will be receiving an  approved therapy for moderate-to-
severe psoriasis. Although it  cannot be guaranteed, secukinumab has shown to be safe and 
effective in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. An additional benefit to patients  is that they are 
contributing to society by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_374621].

11ADVERSE EXPERIENCE REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION
11.1
Adverse Events
Definition of an AE: Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the 
investigational medicinal product.
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) includes the drug under evaluation and the 
comparator drug(s) if specified as part of the research objective, given at any time during 
the study. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the drug of interest are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the drug of interest.
The occurrence of adverse events will be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are 
volunteered by [CONTACT_24479], 
laboratory test, or other assessments. All adverse events will be recorded in the study 
database including the following information:
1. the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)
2. its
 relationship to the drug(s) of interest (suspected/not suspected)
3. its
 duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)
4. whether
 it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE)
AE Severity
The 
National Cancer Institute’s  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Error! Reference source not found. below should be used to grade 
severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that 
a severe AE is not necessarily serious.

Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 22 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Table 1.  AE Severity Grading
Severity (Toxicity Grade) Description
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort;  no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.
Moderate (2) Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.
Severe (3) Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].
Life-threatening (4) The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This
 does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug
Relationship
to DrugComment
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an  event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.
Unrelated An event that can be  determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)
A SAE is
 any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
results in death,
is life-threatening,
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
is otherwise a significant medical event.
This 
includes any SAEs likely to arise from the trial indication or progression of 
underlying/concomitant illness(es) (e.g. progression of cancer in oncology trials), unless 
specified in the protocol as study specific exemptions.
Any SAE, irrespective of causality, occurring after the subject has provided informed 
consent 
and until four weeks after the subject has stopped study participation must be 
reported unless otherwise stated in the protocol. SAEs occurring after four weeks from 
ending study participation should only be reported if considered by [CONTACT_374635](s) during the trial period. This 
includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical 
treatment given to a subject, even if study treatment has not yet started (e.g. withdrawal of 
previous treatment during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of 
concomitant medication).
11.3 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting
Study sites
 will document all  SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per 
UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection  period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.
SAEs 
occurring after  four weeks from ending study participation should only be reported 
if considered by [CONTACT_374636](s) 
during the trial period. This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with 
the standard medical treatment given to a subject, even if study treatment has not yet 
started (e.g. withdrawal of previous treatment during washout period, change in treatment 
to a fixed dose of concomitant medication).
In accordance with the standard operating  procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 Follow-up reports: SAEs will be followed until resolution or until it is judged to be 
permanent, and an assessment will be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) 
of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the drug of interest, the 
interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
The Sponsor shall support  [COMPANY_001] in the following-up of all SAEs so that complete 
information is available to maintain patient safety and also as part of any commitments by 
[CONTACT_24482]-up requests for the 
product under investigation.
Pregnancies: Any occurrences of a pregnancy  in a patient (or a patients partner) during 
study participation will be collected. All pregnancies will be followed up to determine 
outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the 
presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or 
newborn complications.

14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to
 the analysis of the final study data, a detailed  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan described below.  
14.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint
Flow Cytometry:
 One sample paired t-test  comparing mean change in lesional IL-17A 
positive, CD4+ T lymphocytes at weeks 2, 4, 12 compared to baseline.
CAIN457AUS04T Confidential
Version 1 Version Date: August  3, 2015 Page 26 of 33
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015 14.2 Analysis Secondary Endpoint
RNA-seq:
 Identification of differentially expressed  genes at weeks 2, 4, 12 compared to 
baseline within each immune population studied using the statistical program EdgeR 
(paired analysis).
14.3  Safety Data
Safety and tolerability data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Adverse event rates will be coded by [CONTACT_374640].  
 Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_123815], the rate of occurrence, and the severity and 
relationship to study drug.  
14.4 Sample Size
15 subjects will
 receive secukinumab for a treatment  period of 52 weeks (i.e. last injection 
on week 48). All subjects will undergo skin biopsies for molecular profiling.
Sample size justification
Flow cytometry:
 Since these measurements  using real-time flow cytometry have never 
been previously reported, we will have to estimate the minimum  effect size that would be 
clinically relevant. Given the results of pi[INVESTIGATOR_374625], we believe a reduction in lesional IL-17A positive, CD4+ T lymphocytes 
of 10% is clinically meaningful (i.e., results in clinical improvement). The standard 
deviation of the change in lesional IL-17A positive, CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the patient 
population is estimated at 10% (also extrapolated from data generated with ustekinumab). 
Therefore, our standardized effect size is 1.00. For the statistical analysis, we will set 
alpha at 0.05, beta at 0.20 (power = 0.8). The resulting sample size estimate for a one 
sample paired.
RNA-seq: To determine statistical power  to identify differentially expressed genes as 
measured by [CONTACT_16638]-seq, we used the Scotty (Busby [CONTACT_2297].) power calculator which  uses a t-
statistic and incorporates the variance attributable to read depth. Performing RNA-seq on

Any amendment to the  protocol will be written by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a sub-investigator with the 
PI’s approval. Protocol amendments cannot be implemented without prior written 
IRB/IEC approval except as necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  
A protocol amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients 
may be implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five working 
days.
16.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees
The
 protocol and consent form  will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.
Any documents that the  IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the 
study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated.  The IRB/IECs unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by [CONTACT_374642].  This approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_374643].
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may  not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.  
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions  to other documents originally submitted for 
review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; 
an annual update and/or request for re-approval; and when the study has been completed.

Methodology:  
This was an open -label, single -dose, single -arm, single -center  imaging study using DOTATATE peptide, labelled  
with the 64Cu tracer. In total, 59 subjects w ere expected to  be recruited in the study. The study recruit ed both healthy 
volunteers a s well as patients with confirmed or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n of NET disease by [CONTACT_646862] (MRI), and/or computed 
tomography (CT), and/or, F -18 FDG PET/CT and /or F -18 NaF bone PET/CT and/or bone scintigraphy, and/or 
Octreoscan®.   
For safety assessment, vital signs w ere measured within [ADDRESS_866082] 30 minutes after administration. In addition , a 12-lead static ECG w as performed within 
60 minutes before and within 60  minutes following study drug administration. All the ECG data w ere collected in 
digital format, analysed  and reviewed (with manual over -read)  by [CONTACT_646863], whether clinically significant or no t significant.  
To assess pharmacokinetics, blood and urine samples were collected after the administration of 64Cu-DOTATATE 
on 6 subjects. Five 10 mL blood samples were collected at 1, 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the administration 
of 64Cu-DOTATATE. Urine samples were collected in three intervals after the administration of 64Cu-DOTATATE; 
0-60 minutes, 60 -120 minutes, and 120 -360 minutes. The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was focused only on 
radiometric detection using a bioanalytical high performance  liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) method.  
Number of Subjects (planned and analyzed):  
Planned:  It was anticipated that a total of 59 subjects w ould be recruited. The study population comprise d of both 
healthy volunteers and patients with lesions confirmed or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_646849]. The efficacy analysis sample size 
was planned to  be 63 evaluable subjects, 59 subjects from this phase 3 study and 4 subjects from the selected 4.0 
mCi dose cohort of the phase 1 study. This sample size was appropriate to achieve statistical power for the primary 
endpoints of this clinical trial.  It was anticipated that the PK assessment would be performed on 6 subjects.  
Analyzed:  The study enrolled  66 subjects  including  4 subjects from the Phase 1 study. In total, 63 subjects  (59 from 
the Phase 3 study and 4 from the Phase 1 study) were injected with study drug at an intended dose of 4.0 mCi and 
met the criteria to be analyzed for safety and efficacy.

  Version 1.0, 06 March 2019  
 RESULTS : 
Treatment and Disposition:  
A total of 68 subjects were screened for this study. Of these, 66 were enrolled and 63 (95.5%) completed the study. 
Three subjects (4.5%) withdrew consent.  A total of 63 subjects were injected with a mean dose of 4.11 mCi of 64Cu-
DOTATATE.  
Efficacy Results:  
• Based on the individual reader analysis, a ll three readers demonstrated success on the co -primary 
effectiveness endpoints with Sensitivity >70% and Specificity >60%.  
• The majority read  analysis  showed statistically significant sensitivity (0.9091, p=0.0042) and specificity 
(0.9655, p<0.0001) in detecting patients p ositive for disease and patients negative for disease, respectively. 
The probability of disease being present given a positive result with 64Cu-DOTATATE (PPV) was 0.9677. 
The probability of disease being absent given a negative result with 64Cu-DOTATATE (N PV) was 0.9032. 
In this study, the majority read  analysis  determined that imaging with 64Cu-DOTATATE had an accuracy 
of 0.9355.  
• The majority read  analysis  had a sensitivity of 1.000 and a specificity of 1.000 in d istinguishing  localized 
or metastatic disea se among patients imaged with 64Cu-DOTATATE and having an image status of positive 
for disease.  
• All readers demonstrated a level of accuracy ranging from 0.8571 to 0.9355. Readers 1 and 3 were more 
accurate in determining the presence or absence of disease  relative to the SOT than Reader 2. Reader 1 had 
a PPV of 0.9677, NPV of 0.9032, and accuracy of 0.9355; Reader 2 had a PPV of 0.8333, NPV of 0.8889, 
and accuracy of 0.8571; and Reader 3 had a PPV of 0.9091, NPV of 0.9000, and accuracy of 0.9048.  
• Overall, the 3 readers demonstrated a high degree of inter -reader agreement  (Kappa = 0.7664).  
• Relative to the [ADDRESS_866090] intra -reader reliability  
upon image re -read (Kappa = 1.000).  
• It can be concluded that 64Cu-DOTATATE is an effective imaging agent in detecting the presence or 
absence of a NET.  
Safety Results:  
• Overall there were [ADDRESS_866091] common adverse events by 
[CONTACT_646869] ( 4.8%), nervous system disorders (3.2%), 
vascular disorders (3.2%), and skin and subcutaneous disorders (1.6%).  
• All adverse events were either mild or moderate in severity. There were no adverse events that were severe, 
life-threatening or disabling, or that resulted in death. Adverse events that were mild in severity included 
nausea, vomiting, headache, melanoderma, and flushing. Adverse events that were moderate in severity 
included syncope and hypertension.  
• All adverse events w ere either probably not related or definitely not related to injection of a single dose of 
64Cu-DOTATATE. No adverse events were considered definitely related, probably related, or possibly 
related to 64Cu-DOTATATE injection.  
• There were no serious adverse events reported in subjects injected with 64Cu-DOTATATE.  
• There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in mean serum chemistry or hematology values 
that occurred post -injection with 64Cu-DOTATATE or at the Day 1 -2 follow -up visit.  
• There were n o clinically significant changes from baseline in mean vital signs occurring at [ADDRESS_866092] -injection or at discharge.  
• There were no shifts observed in ECG parameters from baseline to [ADDRESS_866093] -injection of 64Cu-
DOTATATE.  
• Injection of a single dose of 64Cu-DOTATATE appears to be safe and well tolerated  in this patient 
population . 
CONCLUSIONS : 
On the basis of these findings, the following overall conclusions can be drawn:  
• 64Cu-DOTATATE has both a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients with and without NETs, 
respectively.  
• 64Cu-DOTATATE has a high sensitivity and specificity in determining localized or metastatic disease.  
• 64Cu-DOTATATE PET -CT image reads have a high level of inter -reader and intra -reader agreement.  
• Imaging with 64Cu-DOTATATE appears to be safe, effective, and well tolerated.

 7 INTRODUCTION  
7.1 BACKGROUND  
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs ) are a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms that originate from 
neuroendocrine cells. These neoplasms occur mostly in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (so 
called gastro -entero -pancreatic NET), but can also occur in other tissues including thymus, lung, 
and other uncommon sites such as ovaries, heart and prostate. Regardless of their primary site, 
NETs share histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features ( Raut, 2006 ). NETs 
retain multi -potent differentiation capacities including the ability to produce and secrete a variety 
of metabolically active substances including amines, peptides and prostaglandins. Symptoms of 
NETs are usually vague, nonspecific and vary by [CONTACT_646870] ( Horton, 2004 ). Thus; non -
functional NETs are not asso ciated with any specific hormonal syndrome, instead, their clinical 
manifestations are similar to most solid tumors, i.e. causing mass -effect either inside the organ 
where the tumor is growing or pressuring adjacent organs and structures. Regardless of the ir 
functional capability, most differentiated NETs express somatostatin receptors on their cell 
surface.  
The endocrine -related characteristics of NETs arise from the enterochromaffin and 
enterochromaffin -like cells of the gut. Pancreatic, enteric and unkno wn origins account for most 
NETs (>85%). Glucagonomas, VIPomas, and somatostinomas (pancreatic) are the rarest ( Fauci, 
1998 ; Robertson, 2006 ), the combined incidence accounting for only 2% of these neoplasms.  
64Cu-DOTATATE (the test product) is a radiolabeled receptor -targeted diagnostic product for the 
detection of somatostatin receptor expressing NETs. The product consists of a somatostatin 
receptor -targeting peptide complex that is radiolabeled with the isotop e 64Copper which has a 
physical half -life of 12.[ADDRESS_866116] established 
by 111In-pentetreotide (OctreoScan™, available since 1995) ( Krenning, 1996 ). Since then, 
OctreoScan ™ has provided good specificity in whole body SRS -SPECT. Somatostatin receptor 
(SSTR) has 5 subtypes. However, 111In-pentetreotide has no affinity for SSTR1 and SSTR4, low 
affinity to SSTR3 and SSTR5, and only high affinity to SSTR2 ( Gorges, 2001 ). Thus, t he primary 
tumor is not identified in 20 -50% of NETs. There are three reasons for the relatively high detection 
failure. Firstly, gamma camera imaging sensitivity is lower than PET, so visualization of deep 
lesions can be impaired. Secondly, most somatosta tin receptor -positive tumors express multiple 
SSTR subtypes simultaneously. Thirdly, even in the same subject the SSTR expression is 
heterogeneous.  
7.2 CHARACTERISTICS  OF 64Cu-DOTATATE  
The somatostatin analog octreotate is similar to octreotide except the C-terminal threoninol is 
replaced with threonine. Octreotate has been conjugated to DOTA forming DOTA -Octreotate 
(DOTATATE). DOTATATE shows improved binding to SSTR -positive tumors in animal models 
(de Jong, 1998 ). Reubi et al. reported a [ADDRESS_866117] NETs, for DOTATATE as compared to DOTATOC ( Reubi, 2000 ). 
This finding has been confirmed in clinical studies , which demonstrated that while uptake in the 
kidneys, liver and spleen w ere comparable for DOTATOC and DOTATATE, tumor uptake of 
DOTATATE was 3 to 4 fold higher ( Kwekkeboom, 2003 ). Therefore, 64Cu-DOTATATE PET -
CT potentially represents an improvement over the diagnostic agent Octreoscan because of the 
higher absorbed doses tha t can be achieved for most tumors.  Encouraging clinical results have 
been reported for 64Cu-DOTATATE PET -CT (Pfeifer, 2012 ; Pfeifer, 2015 ). 
 
  Version 1.0, 06 March 2019  
 64Cu-DOTATATE has 3 main components, namely the somatostatin analogue Octreotate, the 
chemical linker DOTA (tetraxet an) and the positron emitter 64Copper. These three components 
have been previously used in human subjects and in medical research.  
DOTA is a well -established bifunctional chelating agent first used in the 1970s ( Stetter, 1976 ), 
with chemical formula 1,4,[ADDRESS_866118] known formation constant for the complexation Ca2+ and Gd3+ ions. A modified version 
of DOTA C -functionalized to act as a bifunctional chelat ing agent was first reported in 1988. 
DOTA is the most frequently used moiety for elemental labeling, typi[INVESTIGATOR_646853] (antibodies and peptides). There are several derivatives of DOTA also used in 
investigational medicine, such as DOTATOC ((DOTA (0) -Phe (1) -Tyr (3)) octreotide) or 
edotreotide) and DOTATATE ((DOTA (0), Phe1, Tyr3) -octreotate). A gallium 68 radiolabeled 
DOTA TATE imaging agent (NETSPOT)  and a lutetium 177 radiolabeled DOTATATE analog 
(LUTETHERA)  have been approved by [CONTACT_1622] f or localization  and treatment, respectively,  of 
NETs in adult and pediatric patients.  
Copper (Cu) is a metallic element. Copper has two stable isotopes, 63Cu and 65Cu, along with [ADDRESS_866119] half -lives under a minute. Unstable copper 
isotopes with atomic masses below 63 tend to undergo β+ decay, while isotopes with atomic 
masses above 65 tend to undergo β− decay . 64Cu decays by [CONTACT_17588] β+ and β−. 64Cu (17% β+; 
maximum positron energy, 0.653 MeV; half -life [t 1/2], 12.7 h)  is a positron emitter making it a 
viable PET imaging radionuclide which can give real time images of the physiological processes 
in the system. 64Cu has been previously used in investigational pharmaceutical preparations such 
as 64Cu-ATSM, 64Cu-DOTATATE and 64Cu-TETATATE ( Lewis, 1999 ). 64Cu-ATSM [diacetyl -
bis (N4 -methylthiosemicarbazone)] is being studied as a possible cancer therapy ( Lewis, 2001 ), 
64Cu-ATSM is preferentially taken up by [CONTACT_646871]; the extent of 
retention in tissue is inversely related to the state of tissue oxygenation allowing the quantitation 
of tissue hypoxia PET imaging. In addition, the radioactive  copper moiety of this agent may deliver 
a selective cytotoxic dose of beta radiation to hypoxic tumor cells. 64Cu-DOTATATE or 
DOTATOC and 64Cu-TETATATE, are somatostatin analogues that have been researched for the 
diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours.  
The natural peptide hormones somatostatin -14 and somatostatin -28 (also known as Somatotropin 
Release Inhibiting Factor; (SRIF) are widely expressed in the central nervous system, 
hypothalamus, gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the D -cells of the pan creas. On target tissues such as 
brain, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], pancreas and the GI tract, SRIF peptides bind with high affinity to membrane 
receptors and through this binding exert a number of biological effects ( Hoyer, 1994 ). 
Somatostatins are important inhibitory regulators of endocrine and exocrine secretion th at reduce 
the release of a large number of hormones such as growth hormone (GH), glucagon, insulin, 
gastrin, secretin and thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH). Furthermore, SRIF peptides in the brain 
were shown to act as neurotransmitters / neuromodulators th at affect locomotor activity as well as 
cognitive and behavioral processes ( Hoyer, 1994 ).  
The neuroendocrine activity of SRIF is well documented by [CONTACT_646872]. 
GH is released from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_646854] a pulsatile manner, whic h leads to IGF -1 synthesis in 
the liver as well as in other peripheral organs such as heart and kidney. Furthermore , a GH -
independent regulation of IGF -1 plasma levels by [CONTACT_646873] 
(Serri, 1992 ).  
 
  Version 1.0, 06 March 2019  
 In the pancreas somatosta tin suppresses the release of glucagon from α cells as well as insulin 
release from pancreatic β cells, thus affecting glucose metabolism. Octreotide has been reported 
previously to be more selective than insulin in reducing glucagon secretion ( Karashima, 1987 ).  
As noted above, the NET -selectivity of octreotide and octreotate is based upon their function as 
analogues of somatostatin.

imaging. The product consists of a somatostatin receptor -targeting peptide complex that is 
radiolabeled with the isotope, 64Copper (64Cu), which has a physical hal f-life of 12.7 hours.  
64Cu-DOTATATE offers several advantages over a recently approved imaging agent for 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), NETSPOTTM and overcomes shortcomings of Ga -[ADDRESS_866121] was a retrospective analysis 
of a study of the use of 64Cu-DOTATATE for the detection of somatostatin receptor -positive 
neuroendocrine tumors. The primary objective of the study was to investigate whether 64Cu-
DOTATATE PET scan findings had the ability to diagnose somatostatin receptor -positive NETs. 
The study results were previously published ( Pfeifer , 2012 : Pfeifer, 2015 ). The secondary 
objective of the study was to evaluate the PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 64Cu-DOTATATE PET 
scan findings relative to the SOT. The second study was an open -label, single -dose, dose -ranging 
study with a primary objective to identify the lowest amount of administered dose to obtain a 
diagnostic quality 64Cu-DOTATATE PET -CT scan for imaging patients with known somatostatin 
receptor -positive NETs, coincident with the as low as reasonabl y achievable (ALARA) principle. 
The secondary objective of this study was to assess the effect of 64Cu-DOTATATE dose on PET -
CT image quality.  Reports for both of these studies are final and available upon request . The four 
subjects who received the selected  dose in the dose ranging  study are included in the analysis 
presented in this report.

 9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: DESCRIPTION  
This was an open -label, single -dose, single -arm, single -center non -comparative study using 
DOTATATE peptide, labeled with the 64Cu tracer to assess imaging  performance versus 
standard of truth (SOT) .  
The imaging dose was identified in a phase 1 study. PET/CT imaging start ed 60 ± 15 minutes 
after injection for all subjects. The study recruit ed, enrolled, and investigated  subjects 
comprising healthy volunteers as well as patients with confirmed or suspic ious for NETs based 
on histopathology and/or by [CONTACT_646875]/or functional imaging and/or blood tumor markers 
for NETs.     
For safety assessment, vital signs w ere measured within [ADDRESS_866123] 30 minutes after administration. In addition , a 12-lead 
static  ECG w as performed within 60 minutes before and within 60 minutes following study drug 
administration. All the ECG data w ere collected in digital format, analysed  and reviewed (with 
manual over -read)  by [CONTACT_10981] (i.e., not otherwise affiliated with the study) physician 
expert to assess the recordings as normal or abnormal and whether clinically significant or not 
significant.  
To assess pharmacokinetics, blood and urine samples were collected after the administration of 
64Cu-DOTATATE o n 6 subjects. Five 10 mL blood samples were collected at 1, 10, 30, 60, and 
120 minutes after the administration of 64Cu-DOTATATE. Urine samples were collected in three 
intervals after the administration of 64Cu-DOTATATE; 0 -60 minutes, 60 -120 minutes, and 120-
360 minutes. The pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was focused only on radiometric detection 
using a bioanalytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method.

64Copper is a positron -emitting isotope with an intermediate half -life (12.7 hours), produced in a 
cyclotron by [CONTACT_646881] s to an enriched 64Ni target to produce  a 64Ni(p,n) 64Cu 
nuclear reaction. The main advantage of Cu -64 is that it can be pro duced in large quantit ies in a 
centralized facility. Its intermediate half -life also allows shipment of radiolabeled unit doses to 
end-users. Furthermore, the non -halogenated and non -volatile chemical properties of 64Cu make 
this isotope ideal as a PET tra cer. Other key radiochemical characteristics of 64Cu are summarized 
in Table 2.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Assessments  
The co -primary effectiveness endpoints of the study were assessed by [CONTACT_646883] 64Cu-DOTAT ATE when comparing individual reader results relative to the SOT.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Assessments  
Safety was primarily assessed through treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). An AE was 
considered treatment emergent if the start date and time w ere on or af ter the start date and time 
of the injection of study drug. If the AE had a missing start date or time, or if the injection start 
time was unknown, then the event was considered treatment emergent.  
Adverse events (AEs) were monitored for each subject from the time of enrollment to exit from 
the study. AEs that were collected from the time of informed consent to immediately before 
injection were recorded in the medical history. Vital signs were record ed on each subject at 30 
minutes pre -injection (baseline) and within [ADDRESS_866141] -injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
To assess pharmacokinetics, blood and urine samples were collected after the administration of 
64Cu-DOTATATE on [ADDRESS_866142] -injection of the study drug (64Cu-DOTATATE); 0 -60 
minutes, 60 -120 minutes, and 120 -360 minutes. The rationale for selecting these timepoints to 
assess PK characteristics was based on the PK reports of 177Lu-DOTATATE ( Esser, 200 6). 
Radioactivity is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_646856] <10% of the injected dose in the blood 
at [ADDRESS_866143] imaging when each imaging reader’s subject -level result was compared to a SOT for the 
subject, with primary endpoint success defined as the same two out of three readers having 
sensitivity and specificity results exceeding the specified thresholds.

• individual reader sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between localized and 
metastatic disease  
• majori ty reader sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between localized and 
metastatic disease  
• individual reader accuracy, PPV, and NPV  
9.5.5 Tertiary Efficacy Variables  
The following tertiary effectiveness endpoints of the study evaluated the variabilit y between 
readers as well as the variability within readers using repeat reads of selected images:  
• intra-reader agreement using Cohen’s Kappa  
• inter-reader agreement using Cohen’s Kappa  
Agreement was assessed across the categories of “Localized Disease”, “M etastatic Disease”, and 
“No Disease”.  Agreement among the 3 readers was assessed using Fleiss’s generalized Kappa.  
9.5.6 Safety Variables  
The following safety variables were measured in this trial:  
• Adverse events  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory parameters  
• ECG Recordings

[IP_ADDRESS] General Statistical Methodology  
 
  Version 1.0, 06 March 2019  
 The data analyses w ere conducted using SAS © Software, Version 9.4 or higher.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Disposition and Demographics  
The continuous demographic characteristics at screening (age, height, and weight) w ere 
summarized for all subjects in the safety population using descriptive stat istics (mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and number of non -missing observations). The 
categorical baseline characteristics (gender, race, ethnicity) w ere summarized for the safety 
population using frequency counts and percentages.  Detail ed listings of all baseline and 
demographic data for each subject are provided .

Protocol violations/deviations w ere documented by [CONTACT_646884]/IEC, as required by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Medical History  
A table w as constructed with counts and percentages of the number of subjects who were 
normal/abnormal by [CONTACT_6764]. A data listing for medical history information for all safety 
subjects is provided . 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Extent of Exposure and Treatm ent Compliance  
A table w as constructed to summarize 64Cu-DOTATATE dosing for the safety population in this 
study. Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum and median) w ere 
computed on the wand counts on the dosing unit both pre and  post in jection  and on the dose 
volume. A data listing for dosing information for all safety subjects is provided.  A summary of 
64Cu-DOTATATE dose administration is displayed in Section 12.1  of this report.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Safety Analysis  
The following safety analyses w ere conducted on the safety population.  
Adverse Events  
All AEs w ere coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Safety 
was primarily assessed through treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). An AE w as 
considere d treatment emergent if the start date and time was on or after the start date and time of 
the injection of study drug. If the AE ha d a missing start date or time, or if the injection start time 
was unknown, then the event w as considered treatment emergent . 
TEAEs w ere summarized by [CONTACT_646885]. Frequencies of each TEAE w ere summarized by 
[CONTACT_646886] (SOC) and by [CONTACT_926], relat ion to study 
drug, and time of onset (before or after the initiation of study drug). Frequencies of each SAE

• sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN)  
• specificity = TN/(TN + FP)  
The following two hypotheses w ere tested at the end of the study relative to the co -primary 
endpoints:  
Ha0: Sensitivity ≤ 70% vs H a1: Sensitivity > 70%  
and 
Hb0: Specificity ≤ 60% vs H b1: Specificity > 60%  
 
Each hypothesis test w as conducted at the one -sided α = 0.025 level of significance. Point 
estimates of sensitivity and specificity w ere calculated along with two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals using the score method. The sensitivity and specificity w ere calculated on a by -reader  
basis. Success upon the primary endpoints w as declared if two of the three independent readers 
achieve d sensitivity and specificity results in excess of the thresholds designated above. That is, 
the same two out of three readers achieve d success upon sens itivity and specificity.  
 
  Version 1.0, 06 March 2019  
 [IP_ADDRESS].6.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Based on the table presented above, the secondary effectiveness endpoints w ere computed as 
follows:  
• NPV = TN/(TN + FN)  
• PPV = TP/(TP + FP)  
• accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) 
The above endpoints w ere computed using the majority read (i.e., majority 64Cu-DOTATATE 
diagnosis from the 3 readers) as well as by [CONTACT_134475]. Point estimates of the majority read and by 
[CONTACT_646889], PPV, and accuracy w ere calculated along with 95% confide nce intervals using the 
score method.  
Readers who identif ied an image as positive w ere asked to further classify the disease as 
localized or metastatic. Sensitivity and specificity w ere determined relative to the SOT.  
In addition, majority sensitivity and specificity w ere computed as secondary effectiveness 
endpoints. Point estimates w ere calculated along with 95% confidence intervals using the score 
method.   
[IP_ADDRESS].6.3 Analysis of Tertiary Efficacy Endpoints  
For each reader pair (Readers 1&2, Readers 1&3 , and Readers 2&3), a Cohen’s Kappa along 
with a 95% confidence interval on Cohen’s Kappa w as computed. A Generalized Fleiss Kappa 
and associated 95% confidence interval w as computed to assess overall agreement among the 3 
readers.   
Intra -reader variabili ty was assessed using the n= 7 randomly chosen study images that were re-
read by [CONTACT_217223]. Cohen’s Kappa w as computed for each reader on the pairs of re -reads for 
each image. A 95% confidence interval on Cohen’s Kappa w as computed. A generalized Kappa 
and 95% confidence interval w as computed in order to assess overall intra -reader reliability.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_866148] a 90% chance of showing that the sensitivity was at least 0.[ADDRESS_866149] 0.60 a sample of 63 su bjects was needed, divided among n 1 = 42 SOT 
positive subjects and n 2 = 21 SOT negative subjects. This sample size was derived under the 
assumptions that the readers were viewing the same images and that their reads were correlated 
at r = 0.70 and that the  true Sensitivity and Specificity are each 0.90. The study was powered at 
90% for each subtest to give the overall study 80% power.  
This sample size was determined by [CONTACT_646890]. The simulation used 5000 re plications: the standard error of the estimated power was no 
 
  Version 1.0, 06 March 2019  
 more than 0.6%. To satisfy the sample size requirements for each endpoint a total of n=63 
subjects was needed, allocated in a 2:1 (Positive:Negative) ratio.  
These calculations assume d a one -sided  α=0.025 level of significance and that the data c ame 
from a binomial distribution.   
PK Analysis Sample Size : 
The PK assessment was performed on [ADDRESS_866150] OF THE STUDY OR PLANNED ANALYSES  
Intra -reader variability w as planned to be  assessed using n=10 randomly chosen study images 
that were re-read by [CONTACT_217223].  This was interpreted by [CONTACT_646891] n=10%, 
thus n=7 randomly chosen study images were ultimately re -read by [CONTACT_646892].  
The SAP and protocol planned for the creation of 20 clinical laboratory shift tables. Data in the 
clinical database allowed for the creation of 30 clinical laboratory shift tables. The additional, 
unplanned shift tables include albumin, c alcium, carbon dioxide, chloride, glucose, potassium, 
protein, and sodium. Furthermore, the SAP planned a combined data table for shifts in mean 
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular 
volume. The finalized tables inclu de separate shift tables for these parameters.  
There was a discrepancy between the SAP and the protocol regarding the following items: 
injection of radioactivity, waiting time allowed for tracer distribution, and PET scan acquisition 
time. The SAP required  an injection of 185 -227 MBq (5.0 -6.0 mCi) of 64Cu-DOTATATE 
followed by a [ADDRESS_866151] -injection. The protocol required an 
injection of 148 ± 10% MBq (4.0 ± 10% mCi) of 64Cu-DOTATATE followed by a 5 minute per 
bed position PET scan beginning 60 ± [ADDRESS_866152] for somatostatin receptor positive NET tumo rs. The revised SOT is therefore defined as

subject NET3 -SC-0005,  was screened but violated the inclusion criteria of being able to 
understand and comply with the procedures and requirements of the study  and another screened  
subject , subject NET3 -SC-0002, violated the exclusion criteria of having a history of significant 
drug abuse within [ADDRESS_866155] drugs within 1 year prior to screening.  Consequently, these two subjects 
were screen failures and not enrolled in the study.  
PET/CT images were acquired outside of the protocol time window for 8 subjects. These 
deviations ranged from 6 minutes earl ier to 22  minutes  later than the protocol requirement of 60 
± 15 minutes (45 -75 minutes). A complete listing of PET -CT image acquisition deviations is 
provided in Appendix 16.1. 13. Blood draws were perfo rmed outside of the protocol time window 
for 7 subjects. A complete listing of clinical laboratory deviations is provided in Appendix

 11 EFFICACY EVALUATION  
11.1 DATA SETS ANALYZED  
The efficacy evaluable (EE) population was used for the primary a nalysis of all effectiveness 
analyses. The EE population consisted of all subjects who were enrolled in the study  and 4 
subjects from the selected dose cohort of the Phase 1 study  having the following characteristics:  
had an established SOT, were injected with 64Cu-DOTATATE, and had an image read result 
using 64Cu-DOTATATE by  [CONTACT_646878].  
11.2 DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographics and other baseline characteristics for the safety  population are presented in 
Table  11.2-1. The median age of all enrolled subjects was 54 years. Subjects ranged in age from 
25 to 82 years. The mean (SD) age of all subjects was 54.37 (15.65) years  and the mean (SD) 
weight was 185.75 (46.70) pounds . The study consisted of 28 (44.4%) men and 35 (5 5.6%) 
women. The majority of subjects were white (85.7%) and not Hispanic or Latino (82.5%). 
African American subjects comprised 9.5% of the s afety  population. The remaining subjects 
were Asian (3.2%) or other (1.6%).  
A by -subject listing of demographics i s provided in Data L isting  6. Of note, subject [ADDRESS_866156]’s race should have been set to missing and 
therefore the percentage of subjects with a  race of Other  would be 0% rather than 1 .6% (n=1).  
A total o f 47 subjects (74.6%) reported at least [ADDRESS_866157] common 
medical history events included vascular disorders (39.7%), metabolism and nutrition disorders 
(28.6%), gastrointestinal disorders (23.8%), psychiatric disorders (22.2%), and endocrine

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The co -primary effectiveness endpoints of the study were the sensitivity and specificity of 64Cu-
DOTATATE PET -CT imaging when each imaging reader’s subject -level result was compared to 
a SOT for the subject, with primary endpoint success defined as the same two out of three 
readers having sensitivity and specificity results exceeding the specified thresholds.  
Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1 presents the individual reader results for PET imaging versus SOT. All three 
readers demonstrated success on the co -primary effectiveness endpoints with  Sensitivity >70% 
and Specificity >60%. All three readers had point estimates of  sensitivity of 64Cu-DOTATATE  
to be >90% for detecting disease when disease was present relative to  the SOT . Two of the three 
readers had point estimates of  specificity greater  ≥90% while  the third had a point estimate of  
specificity equal to  80% in determining absence of disease when disease was indeed absent . All 
readers passed the sensitivity and specificity hypotheses testing  at a one -sided α=0.025 level of 
significance .

 [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The secondary effectiveness endpoints of the study were the majority of readers sensitivity, 
specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy; individual and majority reader sensitivity and specificity in 
distinguishing between localized and metastatic disease; and individual reader accuracy, PPV, 
and NPV.  
The two -way table utilized to compute sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and acc uracy for the 
majority  read is provided in Table [IP_ADDRESS] -1. Subject PD -NET3 -013 had a Not Evaluable read 
for Reader 1 ( Data Listing 18 ), and therefore, the total number of images in the two -way table is 
1 fewer than the EE population count. Table [IP_ADDRESS] -2 provides the majority read summary 
statistics for 64Cu-DOTATATE  PET imaging versus SOT.   
The majority of readers showed statistically significant sensitivity  (0.9091, p=0.0042)  and 
specificity  (0.9655, p<0.0001)  in detecting patients positive for  disease and patients negative for  
disease, respectively. The probability of disease being present given a positive result with 64Cu-
DOTATATE (PPV) was 0.9677. The probability of disease being absent given a negative resu lt 
with 64Cu-DOTATATE (NPV) was 0.9032. In this study, the majority of readers determined that 
imaging with 64Cu-DOTATATE had an accuracy of 0.9 355.

 13 DISCUSSION AND OVERALL CONCLUSIONS  
13.1 DISCUSSION  
The primary objective of th is study was to assess the performance (sensitivity and specifi city) of 
64Cu-DOTATATE PET -CT imaging in subjects with known or suspected NETs, when 
comparing individual reader results to a standard of truth for each subject.  Success was defined 
as the same two out of three readers having sensitivity and specificity re sults exceeding the 
specified thresholds. All three readers demonstrated success on the co -primary effectiveness 
endpoints with  individual  sensitivity >70% and individual specificity >60%.   
Additionally, the study sought to characterize the predictive valu e of 64Cu-DOTATATE PET -CT 
imaging when comparing an imaging reader -majority rule determination to the SOT for each 
subject and also when the comparison was performed on an individual reader basis. The majority 
of readers showed statistically significant se nsitivity  (0.9091, p=0.0042)  and specificity  (0.9655, 
p<0.0001)  in detecting patients positive for disease and patients negative for disease, 
respectively. The probability of disease being present given a positive result with 64Cu-
DOTATATE (PPV) was 0.9677 . The probability of disease being absent given a negative result 
with 64Cu-DOTATATE (NPV) was 0.9032. In this study, the majority of readers determined that 
imaging with 64Cu-DOTATATE had an accuracy of 0.9 355.  
In evaluating the imaging performance (sens itivity and specificity) of 64Cu-DOTATATE when 
comparing an imaging reader -majority rule determination to the SOT for each subject the 
majority of readers had a sensitivity of 1.000 and a specificity of 1.000 in determining localized 
or metastatic disease.  Overa ll, the readers demonstrated a level of accuracy ranging from 0.8571 
to 0.9355.  
Furthermore, intra -reader and inter -reader agreement were evaluated. Overall, the three  readers 
demonstrated a relatively high degree of inter -reader agreement (Kappa=0.7 664). Readers [ADDRESS_866176] intra -reader agreement (Kappa=1.0000 ). 
It is important to note that failures in detecting disease were retrospectively reviewed  by [CONTACT_646897]. Upon review of these failures it was noted that three 
SOT image reads determined to be positive for disease by [CONTACT_646898]. Included in these miscalls were  subjects [ADDRESS_866177] included  a note -to-file, provided in Section 16.1.12 , 
describing this error . Taking this into account Readers 1 & [ADDRESS_866178] -injection of 64Cu-DOTATATE.   
Safety data from this study are consistent w ith safety data reported from the two prior clinical 
studies of 64Cu-DOTATATE. Subjects in the retrospective study were observed for adverse 
events. Upon conclusion of th at study there were no adverse events or clinically detectable 
pharmacologic effects o bserved. Adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, and 
ECG recordings were collected in the dose ranging study. At the conclusion of th at study there 
were no adverse events related to treatment with 64Cu-DOTATATE nor were there any safet y 
concerns based upon ECG parameters, vital signs, or clinical laboratory values.  
This study demonstrates that 64Cu-DOTATATE appears to be an effective agent in detecting the 
presence or absence of a NET as well as for distinguishing between localized and metastatic 
disease. Injection of a single dose of 64Cu-DOTATATE appears to be safe and was well tolerated 
by [CONTACT_4866].  
13.2 CONCLUSIONS  
The following conclusions were elicited from the results of this study : 
• 64Cu-DOTATATE has both  a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting patients  with and 
without NETs , respectively.  
• 64Cu-DOTATATE ha s a high sensitivity and specificity in determining localized or 
metastatic disease.  
• 64Cu-DOTATATE PET -CT image  reads have a  high level of inter -reader and intra -reader 
agreement.  
• Imaging with 64Cu-DOTATATE appears to be safe, effective, and well tolerated.

naltrexone (XR-NTX), medications are in frequently used to treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent 
youth. Treatment-as-usual (TAU) for this population consists for the most part of 
detoxification (on an inpatient  or outpatient basis) follow ed by [CONTACT_9934]-free counseling or, 
to a lesser extent, longer-t erm treatment with buprenorphine.6,[ADDRESS_854566] examined XR-
NTX with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth. 
Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), developed to overcome the adherence 
challenges associated with oral naltrexone,[ADDRESS_854567] addressed the use of XR-NTX 
specifically for 15 to 17 year olds.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_638877]-NTX, conducted 
in Russia, had a mean sample age of 29.5 years (SD=4.2) and found that adults 
randomly assigned to receive monthly inje ctions of XR-NTX, compared to placebo 
injections for 6 months, had significantly  higher rates of confirmed abstinence.12 The 
availability of XR-NTX offers promise as an alternative treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent 
youth but there are limited data on its us e in this population and no comparative 
effectiveness data of the extent to which it yields treatment  outcomes superior to TAU.  
The present proposal descr ibes a 6-month two-group comparative effectiveness  trial of 
XR-NTX v. TAU for 340 opi [INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth ages 15-21.  The proposed study will be 
conducted at Mountain Manor Treatment Center (MMTC), a highly experienced 
community-based adolescent drug abuse treatm ent center that has conducted research 
with both XR-NTX a nd buprenorphine for opi [INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth.7,[ADDRESS_854568] of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_638878]-dependent youth in the US, namely initiation of 
buprenorphine for the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638879].7,13  
The Specific Aims are:  
Aim 1: To determine the relative effectiveness of XR-NTX compared to TAU for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
dependent youth in terms of the following 3- and 6-month outcomes: a) days in treatment; b) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]; c) other drug (cocaine and marijuana) and alcohol 
use; d) criminal behavior and arrests; e) relapse to DSM-5 defined opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428].

Protocol March 11, 2016 
7 Aim 2: To examine the impact of XR-NTX on HIV drug- and sex-risk behaviors at 3- 
and 6-month follow-up and HIV infection status at 6 months.  
Aim 3: To evaluate the cost, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit of XR-NTX v. TAU 
among opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth. 
This application is of high p ublic health significance because of the growth of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638880], HIV and 
hepatitis infection, criminal behavior, and arre st. There is a significant gap in empi[INVESTIGATOR_638881]-dependent youth,6,8-10,[ADDRESS_854569] dat a will be of considerable 
use to policy-makers and treat ment program directors in order to optimize treatment 
resources. The emphasis on  examination of treatment outcomes in a community 
treatment setting approximating “real world” conditions will enhance the likelihood that 
study findings will be of immediate use to  clinicians and practitioners. The proposed 
project’s findings have the potential to impac t patients, public health, and public safety

2. RESEARCH STRATEGY 
2.1. Significan ce & Background 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_638883] a Growing Problem among Youth . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_638884]. Nonmedical use of prescription drugs, 
including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], is now the second most  frequently used drug among 12-to-17-year-
olds, second only to marijuana.3 Correspondingly, treatment admissions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_638885] 12-to-20-y ear-olds increased 196% between 1995 and 2005.15 
Adolescent opi[INVESTIGATOR_638886], 
including HIV transmission, overdose death,  criminal behavior, and other social 
problems. Unlike the popular c onception of the adult heroin problem as restricted to the 
disadvantaged inner city, youth opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561],  especially prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], is 
experienced by a much broader demographi c, including suburb an and higher socio-
economic groups.16  
HIV Drug- and Sexual-Risk B ehaviors are Associ ated with Opi[INVESTIGATOR_638887] . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_638888] y outh is associated with HIV risk behaviors including 
drug injection and risky sexual behaviors.5,17,18 When compared with treatment-seeking 
adolescents with cannabis and/or alcohol use disorders, youth with opi[INVESTIGATOR_638889] s of lifetime injection drug use and of unprotected sex in 
the past 30 days.18 Meade et al.5 found that approximately 50% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent 
youth reported injection drug use risk and 65% reported unprotected sex within the 
month prior to treatment admis sion. However, there is very  limited scienti fic knowledge 
regarding the impact of pharmacotherapy fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth in reducing HIV 
risk behaviors.5,6,[ADDRESS_854570] of care for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent 
youth remains detoxification ( on an inpatient or out patient basis), follo wed by [CONTACT_9934]-free 
counseling.6,[ADDRESS_854571] high rates of leaving treatment “against medical 
advice” from detoxificat ion, and poor retention in drug-free counseling.[ADDRESS_854572] drug abuse 
studies, when the effectiveness of naltrexone is tested as a treatment for alcohol 
dependence, outcomes are not limi ted to abstinence, but also  consider the number of 
non-drinking days and the number of drin king days where use is not excessive.21 There 
is evidence from some studies  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (e.g., Robins22 study of returning 
Viet-Nam veterans) and alcohol dependence in non-treatment-seeking individuals (e.g., 
Dawson and colleagues23 NESARC study), that alcohol or drug use among individuals 
who were once dependent does not necessar ily initiate a full-blown relapse to 
dependence. Therefore, in the pr esent proposal, the examinatio n not only of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638890]-[ADDRESS_854573] 
effects. Unfortunately, poor adherence has seriously hamper ed its effectiveness. Thus, 
it is infrequently used in clinical practice.24 Extended release nalt rexone (XR-NTX) was 
developed to address this limitat ion. It is a long-acting intr amuscular injection that is 
provided monthly and was recently approved by [CONTACT_638989][INVESTIGATOR_2561].  
XR-NTX was approved in the US in 2006 fo r the treatment of alcohol dependence. It 
provides sustained therapeutic naltrexone  blood levels for appr oximately 30 days.25 To 
date, there has been a safety study of XR-NTX  among adult opi[INVESTIGATOR_638891], a short-term, 
two-site, placebo-controlled randomiz ed trial with adults in the US,26 and a 13-site, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Russia among adults.12 In the latter 
study, following inpatient detox ification, 250 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-depende nt adults were randomly 
assigned to monthly, double- blind XR-NTX or placebo in jections for 6-months 
accompanied by [CONTACT_638990]. The median proportion of confirmed weeks of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_638892]-NTX was 90% over the 6-month trial 
compared to 35% for placebo (p < .0002). To tal abstinence during the trial was reported 
in 35.7% of participants receiving XR-NTX compared to 22.6% on placebo (p < .03). 
Six-month retention in treatment with XR -NTX was 53%, significantly better than 
placebo (p< .02) and comparable to the retent ion rate found in studies of buprenorphine 
maintenance with adults.[ADDRESS_854574] 
deviation of the age of this sample [M= 29. 5 (SD=4.2)] would suggest that there were 
few participants between 18 and 20 years of age, an age considered “children” by [CONTACT_638991]. The only published report of 
XR-NTX in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth was an open-label study by [CONTACT_15957]-I Fishman (see 
Preliminary Studies). Thus, st udy of XR-NTX in youth [ADDRESS_854575] adolescents’ drug use behavior in diffe rent ways such as peer drug use, school 
failure, family dysfunction,  and social development.50,[ADDRESS_854576] been developed to address the 
unique needs of substance- abusing youths and important  studies continue to be 
conducted to evaluate their effectiveness; yet there are few economic studies of these 
treatments.50,52-[ADDRESS_854577]-effectiv e treatment options.  
Summary of Significance . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_638893] a growing problem in the US 
that is associated with serious  public health consequences, including increased risk for 
HIV exposure. The present pr oposal will provide important  comparative effectiveness 
data on the relative impacts of XR-NTX and treatment-as-usual (TAU) on days retained 
in treatment, opi[INVESTIGATOR_638894], DSM-[ADDRESS_854578] udy to examine the 
effectiveness of XR-NTX with opi[INVESTIGATOR_638895], a medication that has been 
shown to be effective among adults for the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].12,26 Indeed, 
as described above (see Extended-Release Naltre xone in Youth), our team has the only 
published empi[INVESTIGATOR_638896]-N TX in this population. Th erefore, the present study 
will fill a significant gap in scientific k nowledge concerning the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
dependent youth. In addition, t he use of the DSM-[ADDRESS_854579] been few 
economic studies of pharmacotherapy with th is population, and n one involving XR-NTX, 
thus adding to the proposal’s innovation. 
Preliminary Studies: Building Towards the Present Proposal  
Our research team has extensive experienc e conducting randomized clinical trials 
(RCTs) with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent adults with buprenorphine, methadone, and XR-NTX, as 
well as with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent  youth with buprenorphine. In  addition, the team has 
extensive clinical experience with provid ing XR-NTX for youth [ADDRESS_854580] treat ment that led to 13 public ations, including mixed 
methods and qualitative research (see Biosketc h). Co-I Schwartz was PI [INVESTIGATOR_638897] v. waiting list57,[ADDRESS_854581] of buprenorphine for prisoners,61 and was Co-I on two studies of XR-
NTX with Co-I Fishman.14 Co-I Fishman has extensive experience treating patients and 
conducting trials with buprenorphine.7 He serves as site PI  [INVESTIGATOR_638898]-funded 
multi-site trial of XR-NTX for probationers (O’Brien, PI). Thus, th e team has extensive 
experience conducting RCTs for t he treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. 
Co-I Fishman is one of the fe w clinical researchers with ex perience in the use of XR-
NTX for adolescents. He recently published t he first report of XR-NTX treatment of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth in Addiction.13 The average age of the 16  participants was 17.8 
years (range 15-20). Of the [ADDRESS_854582] ion, 12 (75%) received at 
least a second dose, and 10 (63%) continued in  treatment for at least four months. 
There was substantial reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_83223] 11 participants (69%) at four months. 
Thus, our preliminary research with XR-N TX and buprenorphine in youth makes a study 
comparing XR-NTX to TAU the next logical step in our research agenda. 
 Willingness of Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-Dependent Youth to be Randomly Assigned to Medications.  
Youth have been successfully enrolled in a number of  RCTs of drug dependence 
treatment throughout the US, invo lving both psychosocial treatment28 and 
pharmacotherapy,10 including RCTs conducted at the study site.7 In order to determine 
whether youth would agree to be randomly assigned to XR-N TX or TAU (consisting of 
varying lengths of buprenorphine treatment),  a survey that provided information about 
XR-NTX and buprenorphine was administer ed to 102 youth ages 15-20 who were 
asked whether they would be willing to be randomly assigned to receive one of these 
medications in the context of a research study. We found that 66% of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_638899] a 
study. We have used these data as a bas is for our recruitment projections.

Mountain Manor Treatment  Center (MMTC) offers a broad continuum of care for drug-
dependent youth which inclu des buprenorphine detox as  well as longer-term 
buprenorphine treatment, residentia l, and outpati ent treatment.65 Its well-trained staff 
includes counselors, nurses and physicians . MMTC has a well-established flow of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth patients and has succe ssfully conducted two NIDA CTN trials 
(CTN-0010 and CTN-0028 OROS-MPH trials). It is  currently a site in the NIDA-funded 
study of XR-NTX for adult probationers. In  July 2010, the MMTC opi[INVESTIGATOR_638907] a competitive award for behavio ral health innovation from the State

2.5. Specific Study Methods 
We propose a two-group comparative effectiv eness trial in which 340 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent 
youth ages 15-21 will be randomly assigned on a 1: 1 basis to receive either XR-NTX or 
treatment as usual (TAU ) for [ADDRESS_854589]-baseline to determine: days in treatm ent; opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]; other 
drug (cocaine, marij uana) and alcohol use; 
criminal behavior and a rrests; and relapse to 
DSM-[ADDRESS_854590] a 
qualitative examinatio n of the treatment proce ss. Out of the larger sample of 340, 30 or 
more participants (approximately half from XR -NTX and half from TAU) will complete 
semi-structured qualitative interviews at baseline, 3- and 6-m onth follow-ups. In 
addition, we will recruit a parent  or guardian for each of t he participants, when possible, 
to complete semi-structured interviews at each of the same three time points.  
2.6. Study Design Issues 
We have conceptualized this study as a comparative effectiveness trial conducted 
under “real world” conditions. For this reas on, we have chosen to compare XR-NTX to 
TAU in an experienced communi ty treatment program. An alternative approach would 
have been to conduct the equival ent of a Phase II efficacy trial with random assignment 
to XR-NTX or, say, buprenorphine maintenanc e. We believe such a study is premature 
as there is only one report of  XR-NTX treatment in youth
[ADDRESS_854591] for treat ment in this population. 
Furthermore, good clinical practice in the community would use buprenorphine for an 
individualized length of time based on the ph ysician’s judgment and the patient’s 
wishes, as reflected in clinical practice in  our TAU. We also considered a placebo 
condition but felt that because most partici pants were likely to te st the naltrexone 
blockade with self-administer ed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], they would in most  cases quickly realize they 
were assigned to placebo. Moreover, a plac ebo control condition could be considered 
by [CONTACT_638993][INVESTIGATOR_2495] d agonists have proven efficacy in adults.[ADDRESS_854592] and complexity of a multi-site 
trial is premature, given t he state of knowledge regarding the relative effectiveness of 
XR-NTX as well our ability to recruit a rela tively large sample in a single-site study. 
Finally, we considered including only parti cipants less than 17 years old because FDA 
labeling permits XR-NTX’s use in 17 year  olds. However, as noted in Background 
(above), there are very limited data on effe ctiveness of XR-NTX in the proposed age 
group, a population that differs from adults in important aspects such as maturity, 
vulnerabilities, and treatment responsivit y, making the proposed age range optimally 
informative. 
2.7. Participants  
A total of 340 male and female  participants, ages 15 to 21, in clusive, will be recruited. 
We anticipate that participant characteri stics will mirror MMTC’s patient data from 
calendar year 2010, during whic h time 60% of their patients were male; their mean age 
was 18.3; 87.4% were white, 6.8% Afri can American, and 2.9% Hispanic. Among 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent patients, 46.1% were heroin-dependent and t he remainder was 
dependent on prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (chiefly ox ycodone). We antici pate admitting, on 
average, 1¾ participants per week (approximat ely 7 per month) and expect to complete 
participant recruitment in approx imately 195 weeks (3¾ years) , yielding a total sample 
of 340 (= 1¾ participants/week  * 195 weeks) participants. 
2.8. Inclusion Criteria 
1) Meets DSM-5 criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427]; 2) Rece iving treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_638908] M anor Treatment Center or elsewher e prior to direct transfer to 
MMTC; 3) Age between 15  and 21, inclusive; 4) Able and willing to provide informed 
consent to be randomly assigned to XR-N TX or TAU; and for participants under 18 
years of age, parental or guardian  consent and participant assent. 
2.9. Exclusion Criteria 
1) Liver function test levels (Alanine Transam inase, Aspartate Transaminase) four times 
greater than normal; 2) Unstabl e medical or psychiatric illne ss (e.g., schizophrenia) that 
might make participation hazardous; 3) History  of serious suicide attempt in the past 6 
months; 4) History of allergic reaction to nal oxone, and/or naltrexone;  5) Current chronic 
pain condition for which opi[INVESTIGATOR_638909]; 6) blood 
coagulation disorder (e.g., hemophilia); 7) Body Mass Index > 40; and 8) If female, 
pregnant, lactating, unwilling or  unable (due to parental objec tion) to use FDA-approved 
contraceptive methods; 9)  and needing detoxification from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_638910].  
Qualitative Sample. In order to achieve a diverse range of  respondents in terms of age, 
gender, and drug of abuse, purpos ive sampling will be used to select 30 or more 
participants (approximately half from XR-NTX and half from TAU) to complete semi-
structured qualitative interviews. In addition,  because treatment adherence for youth is 
often influenced by [CONTACT_29382] s, we will attempt to recrui t a parent or guardian for each 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
15 of the qualitative sample partici pants, to be interviewed at each of the same three time-
points.  
2.10. Recruitment 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent patients in wit hdrawal are typi[INVESTIGATOR_638911] a buprenorphine taper 
at MMTC. Consistent wit h practice in the US and with the American Society of Addiction 
Medicine Patient Placement Crit eria, this taper is provided on the residential unit or 
through the outpatient clinic , depending on the patients’ psychosocial stability and 
insurance coverage. MMTC typi[INVESTIGATOR_638912] [ADDRESS_854593] practice at  MMTC, consent is 
obtained from all new admissions in order to review their ch arts and determi ne eligibility 
for possible research inclusion. Compared to  adult patients, there are very few youth 
patients who present with ch ronic pain/ pain management treatment as a primary 
source of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. Study physicians will evalua te potential participants, 
coordinating with outside care providers, and exclude from  participation any patients 
with a current chronic pain condition for which opi[INVESTIGATOR_638913]. MMTC patients who completed opi[INVESTIGATOR_638914] a setting outside 
MMTC just prior to MMTC admission will also be screened to determine their study 
eligibility. To enhance recruitment, we will di stribute information about the study in the 
community, including school-based health clini cs, adolescent STD clinics, the city’s 
substance abuse authority, and the four other adolescent drug treatment clinics it funds. 
 During the course of the first few days of buprenorphine taper, medical staff meet 
with patients and their parents (as appropriate) to discuss tr eatment options. Research 
staff will then present an overview of the study  to the parents of these new admissions 
(for those under 18 years of age)  and to the patients, themse lves, to determine potential 
interest in study participation. Patients who express interest in par ticipating (and for 
those under 18 years old, t heir parents) will m eet with the RA to discuss the study 
further and to be screened for elig ibility. Screening for eligibility will include review of 
Mountain Manor treatment  records to determine initial e ligibility. Indi viduals who screen 
as eligible will be o ffered an initial informed consent, which will describe the risks and 
benefits of participation and will include informa tion about alternative treatment options 
for those not interested in participating (see  Human Subjects). Ad olescents who decide 
not to participate will receive regular cl inical care at MMTC, which involves an 
individually-determined c ourse of treatment.  
The study physician will m eet with potential participant s (and their parents, as 
appropriate), review the treatme nt alternatives to participat ion, as well as the study’s 
risks and benefits. They will be informed that during the course of the study, they should 
report any concerns regarding study medication to the medi cal staff at MMTC through a 
24-hour phone number. The informed consent pr ocess will include a consent quiz that 
will be re-administered up to three times unt il a score of 100% is achieved. Potential 
participants who are unable to score 100% on t he consent quiz will not be eligible for 
participation. 
As necessary, the consent proce ss will be conducted by [CONTACT_638994].  In such 
cases the adult participant, parent or legally  authorized representat ive, will receive a 
copy of the consent document(s) in advance so  they can familiarize themselves with the 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
16 consent form(s). The RA will then conduc t the informed consent discussion by 
[CONTACT_756], assuring adequate time to addre ss questions, concerns, and to ensure 
adequate comprehension of the c onsent and the study information.  Parents completing 
consent forms concerning their minor children’s study participation will  then complete an 
IRB approved consent quiz to verify compr ehension. Parents completing the consent 
process regarding their own participation in t he qualitative interviews  will not complete a 
consent quiz. The signed and dated consent document(s) may be returned to the 
research staff by e-mail, facsimile or mail for the researcher’s signature [CONTACT_3670]. This 
process will be completed before any research procedures begin. 
2.11. Baseline Medical Screening 
As is standard practice upon admission to MMTC, medical staff conduct a history and 
physical exam which includes a neurological and psychiatric assessment, as well as an 
assessment for coagulopathy (e.g., hemophilia by [CONTACT_98273]). In addition, staff will 
draw blood to test liver function and screen for hepatitis C and HIV, and test for 
pregnancy in females. The study physician will review the laboratory test results for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Individuals excluded for medical or psychiatric reasons will 
be provided appropriate treatment or referra l for follow-up to treat the reason for 
exclusion. Individuals who meet inclusion criteria wil l receive study assessments 
described below, their relevant medical screening record to demonstrate meeting 
inclusion/exclusion criteria wi ll be included in the research  record, and they will be 
randomly assigned to XR-NTX or TAU. 
2.12. Random Assignment  
The RA will administer the assessments at study entry, after which the RA will contact 
[CONTACT_638995]’ s assignment to study condition through 
the use of a block randomizat ion procedure in which, for each successive block of [ADDRESS_854594] access to the 
random assignment table. We  propose randomly assigning pa rticipants to Condition 
while they are receiving buprenorphine fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_638915] (X R-NTX and TAU) are delivered in clinical practice. Had 
the proposed study been a P hase [ADDRESS_854595] seven days. 
However, we rejected that approach for the present study because in normal clinical 
practice a patient who was to receive bu prenorphine for longer t han a brief dose taper 
would not be tapered with buprenorphine, maintained o ff medication for 7 days, and 
then re-started on it. 
2.13. Qualitative Sample Selection 
Purposive sampling, a non-rand om process by [CONTACT_638996] a certain goal (in this case, dive rse patient characteristics), will be used to 
select 30 or more participant s (approximately half from XR-N TX and half from TAU) to 
complete semi-structured qualitative intervie ws. A broad range of respondents will be 
selected with respect to age (approximatel y half from the teenage range (15-19 age 
range), gender (approximately equal  numbers of females and males), and drug of 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
17 abuse (prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_638916]). For each youth participant, we will attempt 
to recruit a parent or caregive r of that youth, w ho will also be interviewed. Efforts will be 
made to include both mothers and fathers in this  subsample but inclusion will be based 
both on their willingness to parti cipate and the scope of their involvement in their child’s 
life. The total qualitative sample will consis t of 60 or more participants: 30 or more 
adolescent patients and one parent or caregiver for each patient, whenever possible. 
The proposed sample size will ensure that the data set is complete (as indicated by 
[CONTACT_638997]) and shoul d allow for the extraction of sufficiently 
meaningful qualitative data in which details concerni ng context and intention are 
included along with directly verifiable information.72,73 
2.14. XR-NTX Condition 
Participants randomly assigned to XR-NTX will complete the bupr enorphine dose taper 
(or will have already completed the detoxificat ion process at another location), initiated 
prior to their study enrollment, over approx imately [ADDRESS_854596] for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (including morphine, oxycontin, methadone and buprenorphine). In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_638917] 4 years at MMTC (see Preliminary Studies), those with 
a negative test will be gi ven oral naltrexone lead-in over  3 days (6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, and 
25 mg) under MMTC medical staff supervision. For cases in which th e patient is unable 
to stay for the full 3-day peri od, oral naltrexone will be admi nistered over [ADDRESS_854597] opi[INVESTIGATOR_638918] 2 hours of administrati on of the 25 mg oral dose 
naltrexone will be given an intramuscular injection of XR-NTX [Vivitrol®] at a dose of 4cc 
(380mg of naltrexone)]. Part icipants who have side effe cts from protracted opi[INVESTIGATOR_638919]-NTX administration, such as insomnia, may be treated with 
ancillary medications at the discretion of t he treating physician, as would normally occur 
in clinical practice. Vivitrol® is FDA-approved for the prevent ion of relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_638920], hence an IND will be obtai ned from the FDA for the treatment of 
the age range that the FDA de ems to be pediatric age (we be lieve this will include 15-16 
year old participants). 
Individuals assigned to XR-NTX will have a dose  administered to alternating sides of the 
buttocks every four weeks for up to 6 months. At  the conclusion of study participation at 
the 6-month follow-up, the MMT C medical staff will offer the participants the option of 
continuing with XR-NTX, to discontinue t he medication, or to receive any other 
treatment option then availa ble. All participants assigned to XR-NTX will receive 
psychosocial treatment as described below. 
2.15. Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) Condition 
Participants randomly assigned to TAU will par ticipate in the standard youth opi[INVESTIGATOR_638921] (or at a treatment program  closer to the participants 
home if they are unable to return regular ly to MMTC). This will include choice of 
medication-free treatment or buprenorphine at the discretion of physicians, patients and 
families. The patients will complete t heir buprenorphine taper or be re-started on 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
18 buprenorphine (if they have already complet ed detoxification and opt to re-start 
buprenorphine treatment), or re main on buprenorphine during t he 6 months of the study 
for as long as they and their physicians th ink is appropriate (in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_638922]). Participants remaining on buprenorphine will have their dose adjusted 
in response to self-report of craving and opi[INVESTIGATOR_638923]. 
The general target dose will  be 12-20 mg buprenorphine per day. Participants will see 
the physician for a brief medication check visi t on a weekly basis and at the outset of 
treatment will receive a one we ek supply of medication by  [CONTACT_50246]. The frequency 
of physician visits and the amount of medi cation provided through pr escription will be 
adjusted during treatment in re sponse to the patient’s progress.  As they stabilize, 
patients will reduce the frequency of medical visi ts from weekly, to every other week to 
monthly as they demonstrate drug and alcohol  abstinence, psychos ocial stability and 
the ability to manage their medica tions properly (e.g., not “los ing” their prescriptions or 
medications). Participants will have the opportunity to taper  off the medication over the 
course of several weeks or, during the c ourse of treatment, to receive any other 
treatment option available to patients at MMTC (except XR -NTX). All participants in 
TAU will receive psychosocial tr eatment as de scribed below. 
2.16. Concurrent Psychosocial Tr eatment for both XR-NTX and TAU 
Conditions 
All participants, regardless of  treatment condition, will be offered the same level and 
type of psychosocial treatment consisting  of 60-minute group counseling sessions, 
guided by [CONTACT_638998] m anual used by [CONTACT_638999][INVESTIGATOR_638924] (CTN 0010). This manual is based on Group Drug Counseling 
for Adolescents and Young Adults in Recove ry for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_238354] (see Appendix)74 
and adapted specifically for treating opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent adolescents by [CONTACT_639000]’s 
group at the University of Pennsylvania. I ndividual counseling will also be once per 
week and will be guided by [CONTACT_3433] e manual Cognitive Behaviora l Therapy for Adolescent 
Substance Use Disorders75 used in the NIDA CTN study of substance-abusing 
adolescents with co-morbid ADHD, for whic h MMTC was a study site. The manual 
consists of [ADDRESS_854598] found them  appropriate for this  patient population. 
Less frequent appointments will generally be needed in the following weeks/months 
depending on treatment response and indi vidual participant’s needs.    
Family treatment services are offered to educate families about opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], to 
obtain their support for participation in tr eatment, to reduce negative family dynamics 
that may interfere with the goals of treatment, and to re spond to crises. Self-help 
meeting attendance is encouraged,  and attention in counseling is given to dealing with 
and responding to the stigma that may be  associated with pharmacotherapy use by 
[CONTACT_639001] 12-Step meetings. 
2.17. Return to Treatment Follo wing Dropout from XR-NTX or TAU 
Participants who drop out of treatment will be encouraged to return to treatment. Those 
who were not clinically responding to t heir assigned treatment prior to dropout may 
choose to either resume their assigned trea tment or to receive any other treatment 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854599] routinely obt ained follow-up rates in ex cess of 90% among a variety 
of drug-dependent populations. Thus, we under stand how to effectively track and 
conduct follow-up assessments with this oft en hard-to-reach population and expect to 
obtain follow-up rates well above 85%. Howeve r, in order to remain conservative, our 
power analyses (see, Power, be low) will assume an 85% follo w-up rate.  To support our 
follow-up goals, we will include contingenc y management reinforcement for follow-up 
visits attended and completed in-person. Using a fishbowl ty pe lottery participants will 
have an opportunity to win a prize for each fo llow-up visit completed face-to-face with 
the RA. A range of prizes will be available to  win, with a maximum prize not to exceed 
$100 in value.   
2.18. Assessment Plan: Baseline and Outcome Measures 
The measures described below and shown in Figure [ADDRESS_854600]-baseline. Pa rticipants will receive $30 in cash for 
completing the baseline interview (at study  entry), and the longer 3-, and 6-month 
follow-up assessments. Participants will be paid $20 in cash for each shorter visit during 
months 1, 2, 4, and 5 (and 7 and 8, if the participant rece ives an XR-naltrexone injection 
in month 6), which include prov iding urine samples and brief follow-up interviews. The 
total amount of money that a participant can receive if he/she completes all of the 
shorter and longer interviews is $170 (with an additional $40 if he/she completes the 
month 7 and 8 interviews).  Participants w ho attend and complete follow-up visits in- 
person will have the opport unity to participate in a fishbow l type lottery drawing for the 
opportunity to win a range of prizes, with t he maximum prize not to exceed $100 in 
value. In addition, if the par ticipant is chosen and agrees to  participate in the additional 
in-depth interviews, he/she will receive $30 in cash for each of the three completed 
interviews for a total of an additional $90. Self-r eport instruments have been carefully 
selected based on their histor y of use in clinical resear ch and demonstrated reliability 
and validity.    
2.19. Measures for Aim [ADDRESS_854601] op-out from treatment or 6-

records as we have successfully done in our prior research.13,57,58,60  
Self-reported Opi[INVESTIGATOR_638925] a nd Alcohol Use (Time Line Follow Back ). 
Participants will be asked at each assessment point about the number of days using 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (heroin and prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] ) and other drugs (including cocaine and 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0

20 marijuana) and alcohol use usin g the time line follow back (T LFB) technique used in the 
CTN [ADDRESS_854602] (EMIT) for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (incl uding buprenorphine, oxyco ntin), marijuana, 
cocaine and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. Methadone data will be analyzed prior to XR-NTX 
induction and at monthly follow up visits as well as for other illicit drugs. Buprenorphine-
positive tests for patients not enrolled in treat ment will be considered as opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-positive 
(but not considered positive for patient s enrolled in buprenor phine treatment).  
Criminal Activity and Arrest.  Questions on criminal activity and arrests will be asked 
using time line follow back techniques at each assessment point a nd will be drawn from 
the brief Friends Research Institute’s supplemental que stionnaire which has been used 
extensively in research with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].76,77 
Drug Abuse Diagnoses.  We will use the CIDI-2 Substance Abuse Module (modified by 
[CONTACT_639002]-5) to  determine DSM-5 criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_638926] e and 3- and 6-month follow-
up assessments. Although DSM-5 opi[INVESTIGATOR_638927], we will 
also administer the CIDI-2 at baseline in order to examine cha nges in symptoms. The 
CIDI-2 is used in both epi[INVESTIGATOR_297134] s and as an outcome measure in drug abuse 
treatment trials.78 It will provide important and novel da ta that is complementary to the 
use of self-reported drug use and of urine testi ng data, and it will be a measure of 
impairment associated with any  ongoing drug use. The CIDI-2 is a fully structured 
interview79 that has excellent reliability in diagnosing respondents with drug 
dependence80,81 and was used in t he PI’s study of IOP v. OP with buprenorphine 
treatment.

Modified Substance Abuse Services Cost Analysis Program (SASCAP).  Provider-level 
costs for the treatment interventions will  be estimated using the SASCAP approach,[ADDRESS_854607] data for treatment 
staff, consultants and cont racted services, building space, equipment, supplies and 
materials, and other miscellaneous resources (e .g., utilities, training expenses). The 
SASCAP method reliably estimates the costs of  specific treatment activities and the 
total cost per patient, and Dunlap et al.[ADDRESS_854608] applied this micro-
costing approach in other studies, su ch as the Cutting Back intervention91 and the 
COMBINE study of alcohol treatments.67,68,70  
2.22. Supplemental Measures 
Expectation of Treatment Duration.  Patient expectations regardi ng treatment preference 
and duration will be asked at base line using the brief questions from PI [INVESTIGATOR_452524]’s study 
of IOP v. OP in buprenorphine  treatment. The RA will em phasize that the participants’ 
responses will not be shared with clinical st aff. The RA will collect information regarding 
discharge treatment received th rough clinic records. The Di scharge Doctor's version of 
the Patient’s Course of Treat ment Questionnaire will be co llected when the participant 
discharges from MMTC inpatient treatment. T he RA will also administer the Patient’s 
version of the Patient’s Course of Treatme nt Questionnaire at the month-1 visit. These 
measures will be used in supplementary analyses to determi ne the relationship between 
expectations of treatment duration and pati ent outcomes by [CONTACT_120247], as

23 Hepatitis C.  We will also examine the change in infe ction status for hepatitis C. Although 
we do not anticipate signific ant changes (as hepatitis C infe ction often occurs shortly 
after initiation of drug injection),92,93 there are limited data on he patitis C seroconversion 
among opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-dependent youth in  different drug abuse treatm ents. Blood will be drawn 
for hepatitis C testing at bas eline and 6-month follow-up.  
Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF).  The World Health Organiza tion Quality of Life – 
BREF comprises [ADDRESS_854609] domains: physical 
health, psychological health, social rela tionships, and environment. The WHOQOL-
BREF is a shorter version of the original instrument and is better suited for use in large 
research studies or clinical trials. 
2.23. Adverse Event (AE) Reporting  
Depression, liver functioning (ALT and AST), and pregnancy (i n female participants) will 
be assessed prior to treatment admission.  The 21-item BDI, which has been used

will be administered (by [CONTACT_82261], if necessary) for those participants who receive the 
XR-naltrexone inject ion at month 6. 
2.24. Process Interviews 
 Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with a sub-sample of 
participants in both Conditions at baseline,  3-, and 6-month follow-ups to examine 
treatment expectations, expe riences and satisfaction with the medication (including 
social stigma and any side-effects experi enced), views concerning dosing and other 
aspects of medical treatment, utilization of psychos ocial services, current drug use, and 
issues related to treatment retention. Th e interview content for patients and their 
parents/caregivers will overlap considerably, so as to provide an opportunity for a direct 
comparison of stakeholder perspectives.  
2.25. Analyses for Aims 1 and 2  
Aim 1:  To determine the relative effectiveness of XR-NTX compared to TAU for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
dependent youth in terms of the following 3- and 6-mont h outcomes: a) days in 
treatment; b) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]; c)  other drug (cocaine and marij uana) and alcohol use; d) 
criminal behavior and arrests; e) relaps e to DSM-5 defined opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427].  
Hypothesis 1A:  Participants in XR-NTX Condition will be retained in treatment longer 
than those in TAU.  
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
24 Hypothesis 1B:  Participants in XR-NTX will have lo wer rates of heroin and prescription 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_74480], alcohol use, criminal behavior and arrest, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_638931]. 
Aim 2:  To examine the impact of XR-NTX on HIV drug- and sex-risk behaviors at 3- 
and 6-month follow-up, and HIV infe ction status at 6-months.  
Hypothesis 2:  Participants in the XR-N TX will be less likely to  use other drugs and will 
therefore report lower HIV drug- and sex-risk behaviors. 
Outcome Measures.   Outcome variables will be of th ree distinct types: 1) discrete 
random variables (e.g., number of days in treatment), assumed to follow a Poisson 
distribution; 2) dichotomous variables (e.g., urine drug test result s for opi[INVESTIGATOR_638932]), assumed to follow a binomial distribution; and, 3)  continuous random variables 
(e.g., RAB scale scores), assumed to follow a normal distribution. 
Explanatory Variables.  The predictor variables in a ll statistical models can be 
categorized as either Treatment Variables  or Control Variables . 
Treatment Variables.  There will be a single treatment variable: Tr eatment Condition (XR-
NTX v. TAU). 
Control Variables . Two additional predictor variables – participant age and gender – will be 
included as “main effects” in all analyses in order to examine for potential differences in 
treatment outcome as a function of these two participant characteristics. The interaction 
between Treatment Condition and each of these participant characteristics will also be estimated and tested for significance. These interaction effects test the extent to which responsiveness to Treatment Condition varies as a function of age and/or gender.  
Time.  Finally, the “repeated factor” in the stat istical analysis of all outcome variables 
measured repeatedly will be  assessment Time point, which will allow for the evaluation 
of both differential course and im pact of the interventions as a function of the “between-
subjects” Treatment Group factor. (For a su mmary of assessment time points for each 
outcome, see Figure 1, above.). 
Intent-to-Treat Approach.  All analyses will be conduct ed on available study-related 
data from all participants, r egardless of whether or when t hey drop out of treatment.  
Statistical Method.   A Generalized Linear Mi xed Model (GLiMM) will be used to 
conduct all analyses. 
Power  
To acknowledge the possibility that there mi ght be 2 equally-spaced interim analyses, α 
will be set equal to .0379, based on t he O’Brien-Fleming spending function,99,[ADDRESS_854611], as it is 
measured at the conclusion of the 6-mont h treatment period. Assuming the base rate 
exp() for TAU and odds ratio for XR-NTX of 1.15, power (1 – β) = .80. This odds ratio 
implies a 15% difference in number of days retained in  treatment between the two 
treatment conditions. 
Stroup101,102 has outlined a comprehensive four-step procedure to estimate power that 
can be applied to GLiMMs. This procedure was implemented in the current case, and 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
25 involves estimation of power using a variety of covariance structures for the Time (T) 
effect. Heterogeneous covariance structures we re defined in all three cases, in which 
the variance component at T1 ( baseline) was arbitrarily set at 1, at T2 (3-month follow-
up) was specified as 90% of the variance of Time 1, while at T3 (6-month follow-up) was 
specified as 95% of the variance of T2.  Th is pattern reflects the frequent occurrence 
that groups become more homogeneous over time  following an interv ention. Correlation 
over Time was specified as .[ADDRESS_854612]-order autoregressive 
structure, thereby [CONTACT_20998] t he T1–T3 correlation to .36. For the UN case, the T1-T2 
correlation was specified as .8, T2-T3 as .7, while T1-T3 as .6. This pattern was chosen 
to acknowledge the change in variances ov er Time (which thereby [CONTACT_639009]). Second, two datasets were created, assuming the 
dependent variable was (1) continuous and no rmally distributed or (2) binary and 
distributed binomially, respectively. In each dat aset (1), the mean of  the TAU condition 
was set at 1, .8, and .[ADDRESS_854613], again ta king into account an expected decrement. 
Similar procedures were followed for dataset  (2). The only non-null effect in each 
dataset was the hypothesized effect of in terest. Thus, simula tions were conducted 
under what might be considered “worst-cas e scenarios.” Finally, observations were 
dropped from the data consist ent with the expected loss of approximately 10% of 
participants at T2 and an additional 5% at T3 (see Follow-up and Attrition, above). 
Therefore, in each dataset, 34 (approximately 10%) of the observations were chosen at 
random and their observations at T2 and T3 were dropped.  An additional [ADDRESS_854614] in the mode l was significant, and assuming N = 289 [= 
340 – 51 (15% of the sample) to conservatively account for attrition] and α = .0379, an 
effect size in the population of f2=.[ADDRESS_854615] size falls in the 
“small” range, with f2=.02 considered a “small” effect and f2=.15 a “medium” effect.[ADDRESS_854616] in the population was 
≥ .0345 (or, alternately, that  the population semi-partial r2 associated with the Treatment 
Condition X Time effect was ≥ .0351), there is 80% chance of concluding that effect is 
significant if α is set to .[ADDRESS_854617], as noted in Stud y Design Issues (above), we intend to re-fit 
our statistical models, includ ing Primary Drug of Abuse (her oin v. prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) 
and its interaction with Treatment Group to  examine, on a post hoc basis, whether 
Primary Drug of Abuse moderat es treatment effectiveness. Second, examination of the 
use of illicit drugs other t han opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], particularly cocaine and marijuana, at treatment 
entry may help to explicate the extent to which the use of such other drugs plays a role 
in treatment outcome. Third, it may be important to examine number of days in 
treatment from the perspective  of a survival model, because such an analysis may lead 
to a better understanding of time-dependent ba rriers that lead to early dropout from 
treatment (e.g., if there is decided attrition in the XR-NTX group after three months, it 
would suggest an examination of treatment impediments t hat might exist following 90 
days of treatment).   
2.27. Analyses for Aim 3 
Aim 3:  To evaluate the cost, cost-effectiveness,  and cost-benefit of XR-NTX v. TAU 
among opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-depend ent youth.  
Hypothesis 3A:  The XR-NTX condition w ill have higher costs per person relative to the 
TAU condition. 
Hypothesis 3B:  XR-NTX will yield be tter outcomes relative to TAU in terms of 
increased retention in  treatment, reductions in opi[INVESTIGATOR_638933] (e.g. 
cocaine, alcohol, marijuana), reductions in  criminal behavior, and improvements in 
quality of life (i.e., QALYs)  to justify its gr eater costs; thereby [CONTACT_639010]-NTX being 
cost-effective relative to TAU.  
Hypothesis 3C:  XR-NTX treatment will yield greater  economic benefits in terms of 
criminal activity and health care utilization in the 6-month follow-up period relative to its 
costs than the TAU condition.  
Cost Analysis.  We will derive cost estimates for va rious treatment activities following 
an activity-based approach.[ADDRESS_854618] of other 
treatment resources (e.g., laboratory te sts) with the quantity used per treatment 
session. The total treatment cost for each patient is simply the cost per activity 
multiplied by [CONTACT_639011], and taking the mean ac ross patients in a given treatment condition yields the 
mean per patient cost of that treatment.  
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854619] estimates described above with the 
associated treatment effectiveness measures  (e.g., substance use,  crime, treatment 
retention). Separate cost-effectiveness an alyses will be conducted for the primary 
outcomes of substance use, criminal behavi or (e.g., number of arrests), and treatment 
retention. The incremental cost-effectiveness ra tio (ICER) is calculated by [CONTACT_639012]. The estimated ICER can be interp reted as dollars spent per unit of desired 
outcomes gained (e.g., $5,000 per QALY gained) . To gauge the sampling uncertainty of 
the estimated ICERs, we wil l calculate the confidence intervals via nonparametric 
bootstrap methods.108,[ADDRESS_854620]-effectiveness acceptability curves 
(CEACs) using nonparametric bootstrap methods.35,70,110-[ADDRESS_854621]-effective as a function of the policy ma ker’s intrinsic valuation or 
willingness to pay for t he clinical outcome. 
Cost-Benefit.   We will perform a CBA to examine the monetized benefits relative to 
costs for XR-NTX versus TAU. The key economic outcomes are crime113 and health 
care utilization. Data on these outcomes will be collected throug h the Economic Form 
90 (as described above). Our proposed approach pr ovides reliable data in a less costly 
manner (compared to administrative claims data)  that will fulfill t he purposes of this 
study. First, we propose to collect data for a relatively short time period which should 
help minimize recall bias. Second, because the purpose of our economic aim is to 
compare differences in costs and consequ ences between the alternative interventions, 
the likelihood of misreporting bias should be similarly distributed in each of the 
randomized study arms with minimal impact on difference calculations. The unit costs to 
be used in monetizing these economic outcomes will be dr awn from various literature 
and public data sources.69,114-[ADDRESS_854622] sensitivity 
analyses in which n parameters of the model are varied jo intly, holding all other 
parameters constant. 
2.28. Qualitative Data Analysis  
Qualitative data will be collected to augm ent the clinical trial and aid in the 
understanding of the treat ment process from t he patient’s perspective. Semi-structured 
qualitative interviews will be  recorded, professionally tr anscribed, and analyzed using a 
grounded theory approach wit h Atlas.ti qualitative analysis software. Grounded theory is 
a systematic, inductive approach to the analysis of qualitative data that uses the data 
itself to generate underlying theories of  the key phenomena under investigation. It 
entails an iterative coding process in wh ich themes, concepts, and ideas within a 
narrative are continually identified, categorized, questioned, and revised. Two 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854623] used 
this approach extensively in our previous research117-120 and this strategy will be applied 
to the current study. 
3. STUDY ISSUES 
We are aware that the study’s generalizabilty may be limited by [CONTACT_639013] a single site. However, we bel ieve that a multi-site  trial is premature 
given the state of knowl edge regarding the effectivene ss of XR-NTX with youth. 
Additionally, the inclusion of a real-world setting, drawing fr om the standard patient flow 
of an experienced community treatment provider who tr eats a broad range of patients 
(from public funding including Medicaid to  commercial insurance) will enhance its 
relevance to a broad clinical audience. A second potential conc ern involves not 
including patient drug of choice (heroin v. prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) as a moderating variable 
in a main hypothesis. The limited  empi[INVESTIGATOR_638934] a hypothesis regarding differential resp onsiveness to the two treatment conditions 
as a function of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638935] e. Therefore, we decided to explore this relationship as 
part of Supplementary Analyses rather than as an additional primary Aim. Finally, rather 
than limiting study part icipation to those under [ADDRESS_854624] definitions of youth,121-123  including that used by [CONTACT_4289]. 
4. DISSEMINATION 
We will publish our findings in  the scientific literature and pr esent at recognized national 
and international meetings. Locally, we will keep the Directors of the city’s substance 
abuse authority and the Maryland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration (both of 
whom strongly support the study, see Letters of Support) up-to-date regarding the study 
and its implications. At the nat ional level, we will work closely with CSAT’s National 
Addiction Technology Transfer Center, the National Associ ation of Stat e Alcohol and 
Drug Abuse Directors, and the American Soci ety of Addiction Medicine to ensure 
dissemination of the study’s progress and findi ngs. We will share study findings with the 
national CTN’s treatment program  directors and investigators.  Finally, the investigators 
will work closely with NIDA Notes staff in or der to communicate findings to the field.

6. HUMAN SUBJECTS 
6.1. Study participants  
Study participants will include 3 40 youth and a subset of 30 of the youth’s parents. 
Unless otherwise specifically  stated, human subject informa tion contained below will 
refer to the youth participant s, and the term participants will refer to youth participants. 
Youth Participants 
Participants will be 340 male and female opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573]-dependent youth ages 15–21 years of 
age in the Baltimore metropolitan area who are new admittances to Mountain Manor 
Treatment Center (MMTC) fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_354315].  
Inclusion Criteria.  1) Meets DSM-5 criteria for opi [INVESTIGATOR_71420]; 2) Receiving 
treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_638947]; 3) Age between 
15 and 21, inclusive; 4) Able and willing to provide informed consent to be randomly 
assigned to XR-NTX or TAU; and for partici pants under 18 years of age, parental or 
guardian consent and participant assent. 
Exclusion Criteria.  1) Liver function test levels (Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate 
Transaminase) four times great er than normal; 2) Unstable m edical or psychiatric illness 
(e.g., schizophrenia) that might make partici pation hazardous; 3) History of serious 
suicide attempt in the past 6 months; 4) Histo ry of allergic reaction to naloxone, and/or 
naltrexone; 5) Current chroni c pain condition for which opi[INVESTIGATOR_638948]; 6) blood coagulation disorder (e.g., hemophilia); 7) Body Mass Index > 
40; 8) If female, pregnant, lactating, unwilli ng or unable (due to parental objection) to 
use FDA-approved contraceptive methods; and, 9) needing detoxification from 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_638949]. 
Individuals excluded for pregnancy, or other  medical and psychiatric reasons will 
continue treatment at Mountain Manor as usual outside the confines of the study and 
will have access to appropriate  obstetrical, medical or psych iatric treatment as needed. 
These inclusion and exclusion criteria will permit the stud y to examine outcomes for a 
wide variety of typi[INVESTIGATOR_638950], ye t balance important 
safety issues (such a pregnancy or hepatic problems) to thereby [CONTACT_639016]. Individuals who meet exclusion criteria because of 
concurrent need for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_638951]. 
We anticipate admitting approx imately 1 ¾ participants per week (approximately 7 per 
month) to the study and expect to complete  participant recruitment in approximately 195 
weeks. This rate of admission will be well-managed by [CONTACT_639017] n Manor Treatment 
Center (MMTC) as they typi[INVESTIGATOR_638952]  [ADDRESS_854632] not to participate. 
We anticipate that participant characteri stics will mirror MMTC’s patient data from 
calendar year 2010, during whic h time 60% of their patients were male; their mean age 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
37 was 18.3; 87.4% were white, 6.8% Afri can American, and 2.9% Hispanic. Among 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573]-dependent patients, 46. 1% were heroin-dependent and  the remainder were 
dependent on prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (chiefly oxycodone).  
Parent Participants 
A subsample of 30 or more parents, one par ent or caregiver for each of the youth 
participating in the qua litative interviews, whenever possibl e (see below), will be invited 
to complete semi-structured qualitative in terviews. We will attempt to recruit both 
mothers and fathers in the sample, but t heir inclusion will be based both on their 
willingness to participat e and the scope of their involv ement in their child’s life. 
Demographic characteristics of this paren t/caregiver subsample are believed to mirror 
those of the youth participant sample. 
6.2. Recruitment & Informed Consent  
Participants will be recruit ed from newly-admitted opia te dependent MMTC patients, 
ages 15–21 years of age. To en hance recruitment, we will distribute information about 
the study in the community, including sch ool-based health clinics, adolescent STD 
clinics, the city’s substance abuse autho rity, and the four other  adolescent drug 
treatment clinics it funds. Th e RA, under supervision of the PI, will inform them (and 
their parents or guardians, for those under 18 ) about the project and determine whether 
the patient meets study eligibility criteria.  
Patients expressing interest in participatin g (and for those under 18 years old, their 
parents or guardians) will meet wit h the RA to discuss the study further and to be 
screened for eligibility. Screening for eligib ility will include review of Mountain Manor 
treatment records to determine in itial eligibility. Individuals who screen as eligible will be 
offered an initial informed consent, whic h will describe the risks and benefits of 
participation and will include in formation about alternative treatment options for those 
not interested in participating. Individuals me eting study criteria, as well as their parents 
for those under 18-years of age, will be told the following information regarding 
participation: 
1)  That they will have a baseline assessment  that will last about [ADDRESS_854633] manager to  obtain the participant’s 
assignment to study condition through the use of a block random ization procedure in 
which, for each successive block of [ADDRESS_854634] access to t he random assignment table.   
2) Those assigned to XR-NTX wi ll, after achieving at least [ADDRESS_854635] for opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. If the

38 patient is unable to stay for 3 days, t hen the oral doses of  naltrexone will be 
administered over a 2 day period instead. (T his option is deemed sa fer than discharging 
the patient before receiv ing the Vivitrol injection, which would put them at greater risk for 
relapse and possible overdose.) Those indi viduals who experienc e opi[INVESTIGATOR_638953] l receive symptomatic medi cation for their withdrawal 
symptoms and will not receive the XR-NTX. Ex cluded individuals will be able to receive 
any other services available at the treatm ent center. Individual s who do not experience 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_638954] a monthly intramuscular injection 
of XR-NTX into alternating buttocks. The medi cation blocks the e ffects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638955] 4 wee ks. The risks of the medication will be 
described (as outlined below). Participants will be told that XR-NTX is approved for use 
by [CONTACT_8335] 17 years and older. 3) Thos e assigned to TAU will be able to receive 
whatever counseling and other services provided by [CONTACT_639018] (except XR-NTX). These services might 
include buprenorphine as a dose taper or fo r a longer period of time, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_638956] (and the wishes of  their parents, for patients under 18 years of age) and the 
recommendations of the treating physician and all the counseling and other services 
offered at MMTC.  
4) All participants will be asked to return to either MMTC or t he Friends Research 
Institute’s office in Baltimore for follow-up in terviews at 3 and 6 months after study entry 
for which they will be paid $[ADDRESS_854636] menstrual period. Participants who receive the XR-
naltrexone injection at mont h 6 will be interviewed at months 7 and 8 to be queried 
about adverse events. They will receive $20 for each of these interviews. Participants 
will also receive $[ADDRESS_854637] the opportunity to participate in a fishbowl 
type lottery drawing for the opportunity to win  a range of prizes, with the maximum prize 
not to exceed $100 in value.  
The study physician will meet with potential  participants (and his/her parents, as 
appropriate) to review the treatment alternativ es to participation, as well as the risks and 
benefits of participation.  Alternative options to participa tion that are available at MMTC 
include a buprenorphine dose taper, buprenorphine maintenance or XR-NTX, all 
accompanied by [CONTACT_275168]. In addition, methadone treatment is  available by [CONTACT_639019] (although it is  rarely desired by [CONTACT_91948]). 
The informed consent process will include a c onsent quiz that will be re-administered up 
to three times until a score of 100% is ac hieved. Potential parti cipants who are unable 
to score 100% on the consent quiz will not be eligible for participat ion. All participants 
will be informed that during t he course of the study, they should report any concerns 
regarding study medication to the medical staff at MMTC through a 24-hour phone 
number.

Protocol March 11, 2016 
39 As necessary, the consent proce ss will be conducted by [CONTACT_638994].  In such 
cases the adult participant, parent or legally  authorized representat ive, will receive a 
copy of the consent document(s) in advance so  they can familiarize themselves with the 
consent form(s). The RA will then conduc t the informed consent discussion by 
[CONTACT_756], assuring adequate time to addre ss questions, concerns, and to ensure 
adequate comprehension of the c onsent and the study information.  Parents completing 
consent forms concerning their minor children’s study participation will  then complete an 
IRB approved consent quiz to verify compr ehension. Parents completing the consent 
process regarding their own participation in t he qualitative interviews  will not complete a 
consent quiz. The signed and dated consent document(s) may be returned to the 
research staff by e-mail, facsimile or mail for the researcher’s signature [CONTACT_3670]. This 
process will be completed before any research procedures begin. 
6.3. Youth Participants in Qualitative Interviews 
From the larger sample of [ADDRESS_854638] a sub-
sample of 30 or more youth (approximatel y equal numbers from each Condition) to 
participate in semi-structured qualitative in terviews and baseline, 3- and 6-months. 
Purposive sampling is a non-random process by  [CONTACT_639020] a certain goal (i.e., to seek out a broad range of participants to insure that 
different view-points are r epresented). A diverse range of  respondents will be selected 
with respect to age (approximately half fr om 15-19 age range), gender  (approximately 
equal numbers of females and males), and drug of abuse (prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_638957]). Youth who agree to participate in the qualitative inte rviews will be told that 
they will be asked questions about their treatment expectations, experiences and 
satisfaction with the medication (includi ng social stigma and any side-effects 
experienced), views concerning dosing a nd other aspects of medical treatment, 
inclusion and utilization of psychosocial support services, current drug use, and issues 
related to treatment re tention. Participants will be told that thei r involvement with the 
qualitative portion of the project will entail comp leting 3 oral interviews (at baseline, 3- 
and 6-month follow-up) that will be audio recor ded, transcribed for accuracy, and that no 
identifying information will be lin ked with their interviews. Part icipants will be told that 
they will receive $30 for each interview that they complete. 
6.4. Parent Participants in Qualitative Interviews 
One parent or caregiver for eac h of the 30 or more youth participants in the qualitative 
interviews will be approached and invited to al so participate in a series of 3 semi-
structured qualitative intervie ws. Effort will be made to ensure participation from both 
mothers and fathers whenever possible, howeve r, inclusion will also be based on the 
scope of their involvement in their child’s life.  Parents will be told t hat they will be asked 
questions about their treatment expectations for their chil d, satisfaction with the 
medication their child is receiving, vi ews concerning dosing and other aspects of 
medical treatment, inclusion and utilization of psychosocia l support services (including 
degree of family involvement in the treatment  process), and issues related to treatment 
retention. Parent parti cipants will be told that their in volvement will entail completing 3 
oral interviews (at baseline, 3- and 6-mont h follow-up) that will be audio recorded, 
transcribed for accuracy, and that no identi fying information will be linked with their 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
40 interviews. Parent participants will be told that they will receive $[ADDRESS_854639] 
a history and physical exam which includes  a neurological and ps ychiatric assessment, 
as well as an assessment for coagulopathy (e.g., hemophilia by [CONTACT_98273]). In 
addition, staff will draw blood to test liver  function and for hepatitis C and for HIV 
infection and a urine sample for pregnancy te sting. The study physician will review the 
physical exam and laboratory test results fo r inclusion/exclusion criteria of those 
individuals who provided informed consent to participate. Individuals excluded for 
medical or psychiatric reasons will be prov ided appropriate treatm ent or referral for 
follow-up to treat the reason for exclusion. I ndividuals who meet in clusion criteria will 
receive study assessments described below, be randomly assigned to  XR-NTX or TAU, 
and receive treatment at MMTC.  
6.6. Research information  
The following instruments will be administered at baseline, 3- and 6-month follow-up to 
study participants: Self-reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_638958] (Time Line 
Follow Back)  used in the CTN 0010 study;7 Criminal Activities  using time line follow 
back techniques and drawn from the Fri ends Research Institute’s supplemental 
questionnaire;76,77 CIDI-2 Substance Abuse Module  to determine w hether individuals 
met the DSM-5 criteria for opi [INVESTIGATOR_638959] 3- and 6- m onth follow-up assessments;81,78 Risk Assessment Battery

has been extensively used with drug de pendent populations, including youth;83,82 Short 
Form-12  (SF-12) a widely used brief instru ment designed to measure physical and 
mental health status;84,[ADDRESS_854640] data on economic outcome s before, during, and after treatment; EMIT urine 
drug testing  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], marijuana, cocaine an d benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_638960]; HIV Testing  at baseline and [ADDRESS_854641] udy instruments, interviews and tests are 
described in detail in the Me thods Section of the Protoc ol (see Measures above) and 
have been administered successfully quite widely as part of drug abuse research 
studies, including in studies of youth. 
6.7. Youth and Parent Qualitative Interviews 
The semi-structured qualitative interviews for both youth and their parents will cover the 
following content domains: treatment expectations, experiences and satisfaction with 
the medication (including social stigma  and any side-effects experienced), views 
concerning dosing and other aspects of medi cal treatment, inclusion and utilization of 
psychosocial support services, current drug use, and issues related to treatment 
retention. The interview content for yout h and their parents/car egivers will overlap 
considerably, so as to provide an opportuni ty for a direct comparison of stakeholder 
perspectives.

manager to obtain the participan t’s assignment to study c ondition through the use of a 
block randomization procedure in which, for each successive block of [ADDRESS_854643] the following safety data: 
Medical history and physical exam . Personal medical and psychiatric history will be 
collected as part of the clinic’s usual MMTC intake procedure and reviewed by [CONTACT_639021]. A physical exam, which includes a 
neurologic exam and neuropsychi atric mental status evaluat ion, will be conducted. A 
history of coagulopathy (e.g.,  hemophilia) will be obtained. 
Specimens . At baseline and 3 month fo llow-up, liver function te sts (AST and ALT) will 
be conducted for all participants. In addition,  participants assigned to  XR-naltrexone and 
anyone who received XR-Naltrex one in the previous mont h will have repeat AST and 
ALT at 1- and 6-month post-bas eline. Individuals with liver  function tests four times 
normal or greater will not receive XR-NTX and will be referred to alternative treatments 
at MMTC or elsewhere. Such individuals w ill be referred to medical follow-up to their 
primary care physician. A urine pregnancy test will be taken at baseline and at follow-up 
for female participants (as indicated). 
Adverse Event Check . On a monthly basis, all parti cipants will complete an adverse 
event form and complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), a 21-item self-report 
questionnaire. Depressed partici pants will have a psychiatric evaluation on site by [CONTACT_639022]-I or another mental health staff member of MMTC. Females will  be asked about their 
last menstrual period (and have a urine pregnancy test, m onthly) and those receiving 
XR-NTX will have their injection site ex amined prior to each XR-NTX injection. 
Participants who receive the XR-naltrexone in jection at month 6 will be followed for an 
adverse event check-in at months 7 and 8. Serious adverse events will include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], birth-defects, and deaths  and will be reported as described below. 
6.10. Reporting of All Adverse Events 
Potential risks  
All study participants, regardless of r andom assignment, may be exposed to risks 
associated with confidentiality  and emotional discomfort as the result of instrument 
administration (as described below) and parti cipation in qualitative interviews.  
Confidentiality . Participants will be asked to prov ide information regarding a number of 
sensitive behaviors (e.g., drug use, sexual behaviors, and illegal activities). The 
inappropriate release of such confidentia l information could result in loss of 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854644], family or social problems. Careful steps to minimize such risks will 
be taken as described below. 
Emotional discomfort . There is a small chance that  participants may become upset 
when discussing their history of  drug use or sexual behavior.  This is an extremely rare 
event and steps will be taken to minimize and address this risk as described below. 
Risks associated with TAU. Other than the risks of loss of c onfidentiality and emotional 
discomfort (as described above) , there are no additional ri sks associated with random 
assignment to TAU. All study participants, r egardless of random assignment, will be told 
that continued or rene wed opi[INVESTIGATOR_638961] l problems including infections 
such as HIV, hepatitis and soft-tissue infect ions (for those who inject drugs) and 
overdose death (particularly fo r those individuals who are not  receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_638962]). 
Risks associated with XR-NTX . Prior to random assignment, participants may 
experience short-lived opi[INVESTIGATOR_638963]. We 
anticipate that this will be unc ommon as only patients who report not using opi[INVESTIGATOR_638964] [ADDRESS_854645] will be given oral 
naltrexone. Participants who do not experience opio id withdrawal from oral naltrexone 
and who are randomly assigned to and receive XR -NTX may experience one or more of 
the following side effects: 
1. Injection site reactions includi ng tenderness, hardening, swelling, redness, 
bruising or itching. In rare cases, it may be necessary to treat a severe site 
reaction with surgical debridement which may leave scarring.  
2. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801]. Despit e having no opi[INVESTIGATOR_638965], it is possible that participants might experience nausea or 
other opi[INVESTIGATOR_314650].   
3. Naltrexone in excessive  oral doses has been reporte d to cause increased liver 
enzymes. XR-NTX does not appear to be a hepatoxic at the recommended 
doses.  
4. Participants in both groups carry the risk of relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. 
Relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_638966] a risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638967] r a period of abstinence is low. 
Participants (and their parents) will be in formed of these risks and of treatment 
alternatives, including methadone  or buprenorphine maintenance. 
5. Naltrexone injections will block the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] a nalgesics. Participants (and 
their parents or guardians, as age appropria te) will be given a card describing 
XR-NTX to medical staff in case of emergency need fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269]. 
General anesthetics, nerve blocks and non- steroidal pain medications are not 
affected by [CONTACT_639023].  
6. Allergic reactions. During clinical tria ls with XR-NXT there was one case and one 
suspected case of eosinophilic pneumonia that resolved with antibiotics and 
steroids. Other allergic reactions are pos sible and include rash, itching or facial 
swelling.  
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854646] the study staff and to  seek medical care should this occur. 
6.11. Potential Risks for Parent Participants 
Confidentiality . Parent participants will be asked to provide information regarding their 
child’s behaviors, including sensitive issu es such as drug use and possible illegal 
activities. The inappropriate release of such  confidential information could result in 
family or social problems. Careful steps to minimize such risks will be taken as 
described below. 
Emotional discomfort . There is a small chance that parent participants may become 
upset when discussing their child’s history of drug use. This is an extremely rare event 
and steps will be taken to minimize and address this risk as described below. 
6.12. Protection against Risks 
Risk Associated with Confidentiality . To protect against loss of confidentiality, we have: 
(1) obtained a Federal Certificate of Confi dentiality to protect against the release of 
confidential information; (2) provide all sta ff with training on their responsibilities for 
maintaining participant confidentiality; (3) use unique identifiers for participant 
information in the database; (4) keep all data in locked filing cabinets to which only the investigators and project manager  will have access. Encrypt ed data will be transmitted 
electronically via the web to a secure server  to the University of Pennsylvania Data 
Management Unit which has double password protec tion on its server and files. All data 
(quantitative and qualit ative) transmitted over the w eb are de-identified. Identifying 
information will be removed from all study dat a prior to publication or presentation. 
Quantitative data will be aggregated to further protect the c onfidentiality of participants. 
Risk Associated with Emotional Discomfort. All instruments to be employed have been 
used frequently and without inci dent with drug abusers. RAs will  be trained to be alert to 
indication of participant discomfort and will di scontinue administration of research 
instruments if a study partici pant shows discomfort. If necessary, the Co-Investigators 
are psychiatrists and they will work with the participant to alleviate this discomfort. 
Risk Associated with Oral Naltrexone.  Participants assigned to XR-NTX will have their 
absence of recent opi[INVESTIGATOR_638968] a urine drug te st for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (including 
oxycontin), methadone and buprenorphine. A low dose of oral naltrexone will be given 
to those with negative urine opi[INVESTIGATOR_638969] s in the last 6 days 
to further reduce the risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638970]-NTX and to reduce the likelihood 
that the participant is allergic to naltrexo ne. Any reaction to oral naltrexone will be 
relatively short-lived (several hours) and will be treated symptomatic ally by [CONTACT_7357]. 
Risks Associated with XR-NTX.  
1. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. Should opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d withdrawal occur following XR-NTX 
administration, the study physician will treat the par ticipant symptomatically. 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854647] ER should they experience allerg ic reactions, which will be treated 
symptomatically with benadryl and/ or steroids as appropriate.  
7. Use during pregnancy. Naltrexone is not approved for use during pregnancy. A 
urine pregnancy test for female partici pants will be administered prior to 
admission to treatment. Female partici pants on medication will be asked monthly 
about their last menstrual period and a pregnancy test will be repeated monthly. 
In the event a study participant becomes  pregnant, the participant will need to 
meet with their medical prov ider to determine whether or not to discontinue XR-
NTX and study staff will follow the parti cipant to gather pregnancy outcome 
information.  
8. Depression and Suicidal Ideation, and Attempts. Peopl e with opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827], 
including those taking XR-naltrexone,  can experience depression, suicidal 
thinking, and suicide attempts. It is po ssible that participants might become sad 
or depressed during the study. Participants will be told to call the study staff or 
seek help in the nearest emergency room if  they have thoughts about hurting or 
killing themselves. 
1.1. Risk/Be nefit Ratio 
Every effort will be made to minimize the ri sks to participants in this study.  Exclusion 
criteria, voluntary participati on, protection of confidentialit y will help minimize risk to 
subjects.  With regard to study benefit s, all participants will receive drug abuse 
treatment and those assigned to  XR-NTX will receive this  medication which has been 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.[ADDRESS_854648] (IRB), and the FRI Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) will provide safety oversight for the project. In addition, an external medical 
safety monitor (an independent physician wit h expertise in naltrexone therapy and 
heroin addiction) will r eport her review of adverse events to the PI, the project’s medical 
staff, and the FRI’s IRB. She will review reports on the study  and be informed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_638971]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_638972] a literature search  on XR-NTX no less frequently than every

Protocol March 11, 2016 
46 Quality Control of Data . RAs will be thoroughly trained regarding administration of 
interviews and completion of forms and their work will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Interviewers will review case  report forms (CRF’s) for co mpleteness and accuracy. Data 
processing staff will review CRF’s the next day. The Project Manager will be advised of 
any forms needing correction, and he/she will bring these to the attention of the 
interviewer. Prior to the conduct of infe rential analysis, the raw data will undergo 
extensive examination for co mpleteness and accuracy by t he data entry staff, under 
direction of the proj ect’s statistician. 
2.1. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
The FRI DSMB, consisting of outside experts in  clinical trials, the treatment of opi[INVESTIGATOR_638978], will review the progress of the study and monitor 
participant intake, outcomes, adverse event s and other safety related matters. The 
DSMB will meet at the start of study enrollment, six mont hs into recruitment, and every 
year thereafter. The DSMB will review all SAEs. The proj ect’s statistician will perform 
interim analyses, at times determined by t he DSMB, to determine whether the study 
should be terminated early as a result of prelim inary findings. The Board will also review 
study enrollment and feasib ility as well as the nat ure and frequency of SAEs in 
reviewing the safety of the study. DSMB  meetings will be convened as needed to 
discuss new findings, unexpected SAEs related to the interventions under study, or results of any other new finding s in the literature that pertain to this study. All DSMB 
reports will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_638979].  
2.2. Criteria for Suspendi ng or Terminating the Study 
The study may be modified, suspended, or terminated at t he recommendation of the PI, 
DSMB, or by [CONTACT_639025]. The PI, 
medical safety monitor, DSMB and/or IR B may recommend modifying, suspending, or 
terminating the study based on the SAE repor ts. Trials may be terminated for any one 
or more of four classes of reasons as det ermined by [CONTACT_4318], as specified below: 1) 
safety/adverse events; 2) favorable benefit -risk ratio; 3) unfavorable benefit-risk ratio; 
and 4) inability to answer questions regarding trial efficacy. 
Termination Due to Safety/Adverse Events . The DSMB’s decision to stop the study with 
regard to safety/adverse event considerations  are based on the num ber and severity of 
study-related adverse events, particularly those determined to be fatal or of high 
severity. The study may also be terminated if  the DSMB decides that there has been an 
emergence of an unexpected serious  adverse event or events. 
Termination Due to Favo rable Benefit-Risk Ratio . If the DSMB determines it appropriate 
to conduct an interim analysis and it provides compelling evidence for superiority of one 
of the other study Cond itions, early termination may be recommended. Such a 
recommendation would not be made without consideration of ot her relevant information 
related to the trial and an assessment of  the strength of ev idence of benefit. 
Termination Due to Unfavorable Benefit-Risk Ratio . If the DSMB requires an interim 
efficacy analysis and its results show compelling evidence for a lack of clinically relevant 
outcomes, early termination may be recommended by [CONTACT_4318]. Such a 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
47 recommendation would not be made without consideration of ot her relevant information 
related to the trial (e.g., safety/adverse event issues). 
Termination Due to Inability to Answer Trial Question . If there are serious flaws in the 
data or the implementation of the study , the DSMB may recommend termination 
because the questions concerning efficacy are unable to be adequately addressed. These problems include serious problems in t he recruitment/enrollment of participants; 
serious threats to internal vali dity, external validity, construc t validity, and/or statistical 
conclusion validity. As with the other ty pes of reasons for study termination, noted 
above, the DSMB will make this  decision in consideration wit h other relevant information 
regarding the trial.  
2.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Participants will be informed that during the c ourse of the study, they should report any 
concerns regarding study medication and expe rienced adverse events to the medical 
staff at MMTC through a 24- hour phone number. Each Advers e Event will be classified 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_462078]-serious and appropriate reporting pr ocedures followed. 
Serious Adverse Events are defined as any death; life-threatening event; any 
permanent or substantially disabling event; an y event that requires or prolongs inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or any congenital anomaly. This category also includes any other 
important medical event  that a study investigator j udges to be serious because it may 
jeopardize the particip ant or require intervention to prevent one of the above reportable 
outcomes, or which would suggest  a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or 
precaution. An Unexpected Event is one that  is not described with respect to nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current prot ocol, or XR-NTX’s FDA-approved product 
labeling. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_638980], Serious Adve rse Events to the Friends IRB 
and NIDA. Unexpected, Serious AEs that  occur will be reported through FDA’s 
MedWatch program (http://www.fda.gov/medwatc h/index.html). As required, expedited 
reporting of Serious Adverse Events to NI DA will adhere to the following guidelines: 
a) Apply regardless of the investigator’s assessment of  the relatedness of the 
Serious Adverse Event to t he intervention under study. 
b) Apply equally whether the FD A will require an IND or not. 
c) Apply to any Serious Adverse Event s that occur during the post-treatment 
observation period defined by [CONTACT_760]. 
d) Apply to suicidal or homicidal behavior that causes a Serious Adverse Event 
in the subject or someone else (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059]). 
Any Unexpected, Serious Adverse Events which occur during the course of this 
investigation and follow-up perio d, whether or not related to  the study protocol, will be 
reported within 24 hours by [CONTACT_639026] (NIDA program  official TBN) and the FRI 
IRB. The telephone report will be followed within 2 days by [CONTACT_5583] a completed Serious Adverse Event Form with demographic information and  a narrative explanation 
of the event. The narrative will also prov ide details of relev ant screening measures, 
medical history & physical, treatment compli ance, participant reports of Serious Adverse 
Events and any other information the Prin cipal Investigator deems appropriate.

change in description of risk, ei ther in the consent form and pr otocol, or by [CONTACT_639027]. The written Seriou s Adverse Event report will also be sent to 
the FRI Institutional Review Board. 
2.4. Reporting of All Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events occurring during the cour se of the study wi ll be collected, 
documented, and reported by [CONTACT_639028]. An Adverse Event is  defined as any reaction, side effect, or 
untoward event that occurs duri ng the course of the clinical  trial, whether or not the 
event is considered medication-related.  A new illness, symptom, unfavorable and 
unintended sign, or wo rsening of a pre-existing condit ion or abnormality is considered 
an Adverse Event. Stable chronic conditions that are present prior to clinical trial entry 
and do not worsen are not considered Adverse Events. For this study, Adverse Events 
will include symptoms reporte d by [CONTACT_639029] l measures of clinical 
importance noted by [CONTACT_464]. 
Adverse Events will be assessed according to the procedures specifi ed in the protocol. 
Additionally, study staff will assess patients fo r any medical or psychiatric side effects by 
[CONTACT_190133] “How ha ve you been feeling since I sa w you last?” Study staff will 
also review the previous Adverse Event (AE) Form and inquire wh ether any of those 
events are continuing. In addition, the AE Form will be administered (by [CONTACT_756], if 
necessary) at 4 and 8 weeks after their 6-mont h injection (i.e., at months [ADDRESS_854649]-
baseline) for those participants who elect to  receive an XR-naltrex one injection at month 
6. Study investigators will follow all Adverse Events, regardless of severity, until 
resolved or until 8 weeks following completi on of treatment. Each new or unresolved 
Adverse Event will be recorded on the Advers e Event Case Report Form with a brief 
verbatim ‘title’, a severity  ranking, and any additional description, according to the 
procedures (see below). If an Adverse Event is  reported that requires medical attention, 
it will be reported to the study physician immediately and forwarded for PI [INVESTIGATOR_345]. The 
study physician will review the AEs weekly to assess their possible relationship to study 
medications. 
A summary report of all Adverse Events will be prepared annually to be submitted to the 
IRB, DSMB, FDA and NIDA. Th e analysis of all adv erse events accumulated-to date will 
include a list of all Adverse Events. Participant s’ descriptions of adverse events from AE 
Forms will be reasonably grouped, counted, and compared by [CONTACT_6660]. A 
designation of ‘more-common and drug-related’ will be given to events occurring at an 
incidence of least 5% in subj ects assigned to either condition. Other significant (non-
serious) adverse events that will be report ed include: marked abnormalities in liver 
function tests or other laborat ory tests; adverse events lead ing to dropouts; and adverse 
events that lead to the addition of concom itant therapy. The summary report of all 
adverse events will be provided to NIDA at the time of the study’s continuing IRB 
reviews.

are highly experienced in pr oviding opi[INVESTIGATOR_638983] 15-21 years 
of age in their specialized treatment unit.  
2.6. Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
Participation of Women . Considering characteristics of new admissions to Mountain 
Manor Treatment Center in 2010, sufficient numbers of wo men will be represented in 
the participant population. It is  estimated that of the 340 par ticipants, 136 (40%) will be 
women. A number of our public ations have focused on gender differences with regard 
to drug use and patient outcomes. 
Participation of Minorities . Considering characteristics of new admissions to Mountain 
Manor Treatment Center in 2010,  we expect that the partici pation of minorities in the 
proposed study will mirror that  of the program’s new admission in 2010. Thus, we 
estimated that of the 340 part icipants, 24 (7%) will be Afri can-American and 316 (93%) 
will be White and 10 (3.4%) will be Hispani c. We have been working with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
dependent individuals, both Af rican-American and White in  Baltimore since the mid-
1960s and have acquired an understanding and aw areness of the social and cultural 
factors that operate within t hese populations. The population of Hispanics in Baltimore 
City is very small (i.e., just over 4% of the population) and few are represented among 
the patients in its drug treat ment programs. Hence, we do not anticipate having the 
ability to recruit a significant number of His panic participants. Many of our publications 
have focused on the differences between Af rican-American and White opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-addicted 
individuals with regard to the nat ural history of drug addicti on, lifestyles, and attitudes 
toward opi[INVESTIGATOR_638984]. 
3. FACILITIES AND RESOURCES 
3.1. Office:  Friends R esearch Institute, Inc. 
Friends Research Institute (FRI)  is located in offices on the first level of [ADDRESS_854651] in Baltimore, MD., zip code [ZIP_CODE] (8,695 sq. ft.). The space is 
completely equipped for this project, includi ng areas set aside for conducting interviews 
with research participants. The facilities ar e ADA compliant and easily accessible via 
public transportation (bus and/or light rail). FR I offices are available 5 days a week. The 
FRI office in Baltimore, where the investigat ors will be located, is within 20 minutes of 
Mountain Manor Trea tment Center.  
Research Environment . FRI’s Baltimore office was established in the mid 1960s to 
create a supportive research environment fo r the interdisciplinary work of behavioral 
scientists who have conducted prevention and intervention res earch in drug abuse 
treatment. Currently, investigators at FR I in Baltimore are undertaking a diverse 
program of prevention and intervention res earch including the following NIDA-funded 
Extended Release Naltrexone for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -Dependent Youth   Version 14.0 
Protocol March 11, 2016 
50 studies; 1) Entry into Comprehensive Met hadone Treatment via Interim Maintenance; 2) 
Buprenorphine for Prisoners; 3) Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Tr eatment Study (CJ-
DATS); 4) Intensive Outpatient v. Outp atient Treatment amo ng African American 
Buprenorphine Patients; 5) SBIRT in New Mexi co; 6) Naltrexone for Probationers; 7) 
Re-engineering Methadone Treatment; 8) Mid- Atlantic Node of th e Clinical Trials 
Network; and 9) Seek, Test, and Treat: HIV in  the Criminal Justice System. [CONTACT_639031], a pharmacologist and former Director  of NIDA Medication’s Development 
Division, became the President of FR I in January, 2009 joining FRI’s seasoned 
investigators. 
FRI investigators have also created and fost ered lengthy tenured relationships with 
federal, state, and local agencies. More im portantly FRI has bec ome engrained in the 
fiber of Baltimore City, coll aborating with the Baltimore Cit y Substance Abuse Authority 
and the Single State Agency as well as a multitude of treatment agencies and the 
Department of Corrections to successfully produce research that benefits the lives of 
many Baltimore City resident s who have been drug-dependent, and their families. FRI 
has a long-standing research collaboration with Co-I Fishman and Mountain Manor 
Treatment Center (described below) and  is currently conducting an R01 studying 
extended release naltrexone for adult probationers and is coll aborating as part of the 
Mid-Atlantic Node of the CTN. 
Institute Organizational a nd Research Infrastructure . The administration of the FRI 
Center is supported through t he coordinated efforts of an experienced and capable 
resource team charged with meeting the oper ational needs of its investigators and 
collaborators. The infrastructu re for these efforts consists  of three key elements: 1) 
Secretarial Services; 2) Computer Support; and 3) Website and List Serv functionality. 
FRI currently has in place a research support infrastructu re readily adaptable to meet 
the needs of field research. This infrastruc ture is composed of four units: 1) Data 
Acquisition; 2) Data Management; 3) Quality Assurance; and 4) Statistical Services.  
While functionally separate, these four units  are in continuing communication with each 
other, with supervisory FRI researchers, and the University of Pennsylvania Data 
Management Unit dynamically managing all issues related to research support, from 
study design through statistical analysis, interpretation, and publication under the 
direction of the in vestigators.

 2. INTRODUCTION  
 
This protocol proposes to examine the anti-tumor efficacy and in vivo  persistence of 
adoptively  transferred, autologous , tumor -infiltrating  lymphocytes (TIL) following 
lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, in patients with metastatic 
melanoma. This study will also assess prognostic markers and safety of the infused 
autologous TIL following lymphodepletion.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
 3.[ADDRESS_628366] significant among cancers
2.  
 In a landmark year for melanoma therapy , two new drugs were FDA -approved in 2011 
for advanced melanoma. Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a n immune  checkpoint blocker, offers long- term 
disease control for approximately 20% of patients, but complete responses are rare
3. 
Vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, produces rapid disease regression in roughly 50% of 
patients whose tumor carries a v600 mutation of BRAF, but  these responses are 
almost always short -lived, with a median duration of only 6.[ADDRESS_628367] 10 to 15 years, there has been growing enthusiasm for adoptive cell therapy (ACT), a technical approach in which the patient’s autologous T cells are expanded, manipulated ex vivo , and then re- infused into the patient to exert an anti -
tumor response. Clinical trials of adoptive cellular therapy in our lab and others have 
demonstrated dramatic tumor regressions in an increasing number of melanoma 
patients with refractory metastatic disease
5-10.  
 3.[ADDRESS_628368] to tumor vaccination 
strategies, adoptive T cell therapy can allow for far greater control over the magnitude of 
                         Page 5 
 the targeted response by [CONTACT_489036] T cells used for 
therapy11,12. Requisite numbers of high affinity effectors can be routinely achieved 
producing frequencies of tumor -specific T cells  in the peripheral blood that are  several -
fold higher than that possible by [CONTACT_489037].   
 
3.2.2 Adoptive Therapy of Melanoma Using Antigen -Specific CD8+ T Cell Clones  
The Yee Lab has recently reported the results of a Phase I study of adoptive therapy 
using CD8+ T cell clones targeting the tumor -associated antigens, MART1/MelanA and 
gp100, for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma13.  Eleven patients with 
bulky, refractory melanoma received cyclophosphami de 4000 mg/m2 across 2 days, 
then 1010 antigen- specific, CD8+ cytotoxic T cell clones, followed by [CONTACT_8668]- 2. Five of ten 
evaluable patients had stable disease at 8 weeks, and one patient had a complete remission that has persisted for greater than 3 years.  
 
In another phase I study for patients with refractory metastatic melanoma, Yee and 
colleagues administered 4 infusions of autologous T cell clones (the first without IL- 2) 
and subsequent infusions with low -dose IL- 2 for 14 days14.  Among 43 infusions at 
doses up to 3.3 x 109 cells/m2 per dose administered to [ADDRESS_628369] therapy experience an average median survival of 4 months.  Among the initial cohort of 10 patients with progressive metastatic melanoma receiving T cell therapy in this study, 8 experienced minor, mixed 
or stable responses for periods of 2- 21 months (average of 11 months).  
 
3.2.3  Adoptive Therapy using Tumor -Infiltrating Lymphocytes  
 
In 1988, Rosenberg and colleagu es at the NIH demonstrated that tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) derived from resected tumors and expanded in vitro were capable of specifically recognizing tumor antigens and mediating tumor regression in melanoma 
patients
15. An analysis of 86 melanoma patients treated with TIL followed by [CONTACT_5019]- dose 
IL-2 at the NIH from 1987 to 1992 demonstrated a 34% overall response rate, with 
similar activity in patients with prior IL -2 exposure or no prior IL-216. Five patients (6%) 
had a complete response but only two were durable at [ADDRESS_628370] reached 50 -70% and 
durable complete responses have reached 20- 40%.  
 
An important advantage held by  [CONTACT_489038] T cell clones is that TIL generation does not 
rely on exogenous peptide and therefore patient eligibility is not limited to the handful of HLA types to w hich the currently available peptides are restricted. In contrast, our trials 
with T cell clones are only open to patients with HLA type A2, which excludes 
approximately 60% of the population. The shorter generation time of 5- [ADDRESS_628371] more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_489009]’t wait months for treatment. Additionally, because TIL can be generated more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_489010] [ADDRESS_628372] trial, a 
nonmyeloablative regimen was administered using cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg for 2 days) and fludarabine (25 mg/m
2 for 5 days) followed by [CONTACT_489039]- dose IL-
2. The two subsequent TIL trials gave cyclophosphamide and fludarabine at the same doses as before, but with the addition of [ADDRESS_628373] trial. Although the trials were conducted sequentially, limiting the reliability of a comparison, they noted  that the overall response rates and complete response rates 
were progressively higher with the greater intensity of lympho- and myeloablation. For 
the no- TBI, 2Gy -TBI, and 12Gy -TBI trials, the objective response rate was 49%, 52% 
and 72%, respectively, and the complete response rate was 12%, 20% and 40%, 
respectively
10. All but one of the CRs have continued beyond 3 y ears.  
 
While the response rates are impressive, the myeloablative regimens carried significant toxicity. The latter two trials required hematopoietic rescue with autologous stem cells after TIL infusion due to the intensity of the myeloablative regimen. T here was one 
treatment -related death out of 93 patients and one patient with prolonged pulmonary 
hypertension; both were on the 2Gy -TBI trial. Five patients on the 12Gy -TBI arm 
developed long- standing microangiopathic nephropathy, though interestingly, all  five 
patients also achieved CRs and recovered from their renal failure. Because the higher response rates  of the 12Gy -TBI regimen is likely  biased by [CONTACT_489040], a prospective randomized tr ial 
is ongoing in which patients will receive identical TIL cell and conditioning regimens, but half will also receive TBI with autologous stem cell support (study identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], clinicaltrials.gov).  
 
The creation of a lymphopenic environment prior to TIL infusion is believed to enhance TIL proliferation and activity by [CONTACT_489041] T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells that are otherwise promoted by [CONTACT_489042], such as TGF- β and apoptosis -inducing receptor -
ligand interactions
18,19. It is also widely believed that the elimination of other 
lymphocytes decreases the competition for homeostatic cytokines IL- 7 and IL- 15, 
providing both physical and biologic “space” for TIL and other potential effectors , such 
as NK cells , to proliferate and survive20.  Total body irradiation contributes to 
lymphodepletion but also appears to increase the function of antigen -presenting cells by 
[CONTACT_489043], in part due to bacterial translocation from gut 
mucosal damage, which provides activation signals to antigen- presenting cells through  
their toll -like receptors21.

 3.3 Rationale and Proposed Study of TIL Therapy for the Treatment of Patients 
with Metastatic Melanoma  
 
TIL therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning and 
adjuvant high- dose IL-2 has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_489044] 50%, which is superior to all other available 
treatments for metastatic melanoma. Responses have been seen in patients who have failed high- dose IL- 2, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_489011].  Current  adoptive therapy  strategies 
at our institution using T cell clones have been limited  to the minority  of melanoma 
patients  who are HLA-A2 positive. In contrast, TIL therapy would be available to 
patients of all HLA types because it does not rely on HLA -restricted, exogenous peptide. 
In addition, the faster generation time mak es TIL a more viable option for patients who 
are experiencing disease progression and can’t wait months for T cell clones to grow .  
 
These early successes of TIL therapy have also given rise to important unanswered 
questions regarding the variability in response among patients and the need to  identify 
prognostic factors to determine which patients are likely to respond to TIL and thus 
avoid a costly manufacturing process  for patients with little chance of benefit . The 
inherent requirement of a tumor biopsy for TIL generation provides a built -in guarantee 
of melanoma tissue for analysis of immunohistochemical features, molecular and genetic markers.  
 
We propose a phase II  study evaluating the anti -tumor activity , persistence,  safety, as 
well as  prognostic mar kers and immunologic correlates  for durable benefit from  TIL 
therapy following a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide, and 
fludarabine, and adjuvant high- dose IL- 2, for patients with metastatic melanoma.  
 4. OBJECTIVES  
 
4.A. Primary Objectives  
 
1. Examine the anti -tumor efficacy of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in metastatic 
melanoma patients using autologous tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes with a 
lymphodepleting conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine , and 
followed by [CONTACT_489045]- dose IL- 2. 
 
4.B. Secondary objectives  
 
1. Determine the in vivo  persistence of transferred tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes. 
 
2. Examine the safety of cellular adoptive immunotherapy in melanoma patients 
using autologous tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes, preceded by  a lymphodepleting 
conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and  followed by  
[CONTACT_489045]- dose IL- 2. 
 
3. Evaluate for molecular tumor markers and immunohistochemical features  that 
correlate with in vivo persistence and anti -tumor efficacy.  
 
                      Page 8 
  5. STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a single -center, nonrandomized study that will enroll 20 patients with 
metastatic melanoma for the treatment phase (Step II) of this protocol . The protocol 
utilizes a pre- screening stage (Step I) to obtain the 20 treatment -eligible patients for 
whom TIL can be expanded to sufficient numbers. Enrollment on Step I will stop once 
there are 20 enro lled patients for Step II . The actual enrollment number for Step I is 
anticipated to be 80- 120 patients based on an expected 50% success rate for TIL 
generation, mitigated by [CONTACT_489046] I and Step II due to external factors such as disease progression or response to other therapy.  
 Starting on day -7 , patients will receive cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg/day intravenously 
for two days , then  fludarabine 25mg/m
2/day intravenously for five days, followed by a 
single TIL infusion at a dose up to 1.5 x 1011 cells on day 0.  Within 24 hours of the TIL 
infusion,  high-dose IL- 2 will be administered at 600,000  units/kg every [ADDRESS_628374] or 
PET/CT will be performed at week 6, week 12 and week 24 after TIL infusion.  
 The chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (days - 7 to - 1) will be 
administered at the University of Washington Medical Center inpatient oncology unit, or if the patient is deemed suitable by [CONTACT_978], at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance on the outpatient Immunotherapy Service. Treatment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) will be given at the UWMC inpatient oncology unit, or if the patient is deemed suitable by [CONTACT_978], at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance on the outpatient Immunotherapy Service  IL-2 therapy (days  +1 to +5) will given at the University of Washington Medical Center. 
in the intensive care unit (ICU) to allow close monitoring and evaluation of the patients.

6. PATIENT SELECTION  
Patients will be enrolled through the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance Melanoma Clinic (a clinical consortium of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489012]) . This protocol is designed to treat patients with 
measurable  metastatic melanoma. An average of [ADDRESS_628375] 50% of these 
will meet eligibility criteria for Step 1. We anticipate we will succeed in expanding TIL for 

 
                      Page 9 
  60% of the patients enrolle d on Step I of the protocol, and thus,  the enrollment for the 
targeted of 20 treated patients will be completed within 30- 36 months, and treatment 
and analysis of all patients completed by 36- 42 months.  
 
Patient evaluation for eligibility and enrollment will occur in a two- step process: Step I 
for pre -screen and TIL generation, and Step II for treatment.  Results of tests and/or 
procedures conducted as per standard of care may be used for eligibility determination if conducted within an appropri ate window prior to screening.  
 6.1 Step I: Pre -screen and initiation of TIL expansion. 
Patients must fulfill all the following criteria to be eligible for Step I of the study.  
 
 [ADDRESS_628376], 18 years of age or older and able to tolerate high- dose cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and high- dose 
IL-2.  
c. ECOG  performance status of 0-1 (Appendix A )  
d. Patients must have an MRI, CT, or PET of the brain within [ADDRESS_628377].  
 
  6. 1.2 Step I Exclusion Criteria  
 
a. M en or women of reproductive ability who are unwilling to use 
effective contraception or abstinence for 4 months after treatment.  
b. Calculated creatinine clearance (eGFR) < 60ml/min.  EGFR values 
can be determined by [CONTACT_489047] -Gault equation 
based on the investigator’s discretion.  
c. Significant hepatic dysfunction ( AST/ALT  > 3x upper lim it of 
normal; total bilirubin > 2.0  mg/d l, except in patients with Gilbert’s 
Syndrome whose total bilirubin must not exceed 3.0 mg/dl ) 
deemed by [CONTACT_489048]. 
d. Clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction (FEV1<65%  predicted,  
FVC <65% of predicted, DLCO (corrected for Hgb) <50% predicted). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) within 4 months prior 
to consent for Step I will be required for patients with underlying risk factors such as smoking history  >10 pack years , or a history of 
pre-existing symptom atic lung disease ( not including melanoma 
metastases to the lung) .  
e.  Pre-existing known cardiovascular abnormalities as defined by [CONTACT_489049]:   
• congestive heart failure,  
 
                      Page 10 
  • clinically significant hypotension,  
• cardiac ischemia, or symptoms of coronary artery disease,  
• presence of cardiac arrhythmias on EKG requiring drug therapy,  
• ejection fraction < 45% (echocardiogram or MUGA), although 
any patient with an ejection fraction between 45- 49% must 
receive clearance by a cardiologist to be eligible for Step II of 
the trial  
f. Clinically significant autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression. Patients with AIDS or HIV -1 associated 
complex or known to be HIV antibody seropositive or known to be 
recently PCR+ for hepatitis  B or C  are not eligible for this study. 
The severely depressed or altered immune system found in these 
patients and the possibility of premature death would compromise study objectives.  
g. Patients with active  systemic infection  requiring intravenous 
antibiotics . 
h. Clinically significant psychiatric disease which , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_489013] -I, would render immunotherapy and its potential 
sequelae unsafe or compliance with procedural requirements 
unlikely . 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_628378] sign an informed consent form for Step I. Patients will be screened for 
Hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody,  hepatitis B surface antibody,  
hepatitis C virus antibody, HIV 1/[ADDRESS_628379] for syphilis (STS) within

7. STUDY AGENTS  
 7.1 Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes  (TIL) 
All infused TIL products will be autologous lymphocytes derived from excisional or incisional tumor biopsies of metastatic melanoma. Methods employed to generate and select TIL for infusion are outlined in Appendix B. In brief, tumor fragments are cultured in media containing IL- [ADDRESS_628387] extensively studied 
22. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that prevents cell 
division by [CONTACT_12783]- linking DNA strands.  
 In clinical studies where no other chemotherapy drugs were administered, cyclophosphamide alone at doses of 30 – 120 mg/kg (1000 to 4000 mg/m
2) has a 
predictable hematologic profile with a period of neutropenia and leukopenia beginning 8-10 days after treatment lasting 7- 10 days followed by a relatively rapid recovery.  
Thrombocytopenia may be more prolonged, but recovery to normal levels is usually complete.  The dose limiting toxicity from cyclophosphamide is not hematopoietic, but cardiac at doses  up to 8000 mg/m2- when given as an IV bolus
23. Cardiac toxi cities 
from cyclophosphamide include arrhythmias, potentially irreversible cardiomyopathy and pericarditis.   Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in approximately 20% of patients, ranging from microscopic hematuria to extensive cystitis with bladder fibrosis. Mesna (sodium 2-
mercaptoethanesulphonate) is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound that can interact with 
the urotoxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide to decrease the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis.  
 7.3 Fludarabine  
 
                      Page 14 
  Fludarabine is a purine analog that inhibits DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_489051]. Fludarabine induces lym phopenia 
in greater than 30% of  patients treated with a standard 5- day course of fludarabine at 25 
mg/m2 24.  Although fludarabine is an effective agent against hematologic malignancies, 
such as CLL, low -grade non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and Waldenström's 
macroglobulinemia, it has no anti -tumor effect on solid tumors such as melanoma.  
 Lymphopenia is  characterized by a CD4 > CD8 T cell depletion that results in 
lymphocyte counts  falling to 30- 40% of baseline or less that is sustained for periods of 
several weeks to months and is associated with T cell dysfunction- related infections 
25,26. The risk of lymphopenia, the severity and frequency of infectious complications 
observed in patients receiving multiple courses of fludarabine is much lower when patients receive a single five- day course of fludarabine
27. Approximately 25% of patients 
receiving a 5- day course of treatment will develop an infection that is generally 
treatable. Patients receiving only a 3- day course of fludarabine exhibit a significantly 
lower incidence of infection per treatment course (14%) without a significant decrease in anti-lymphoproliferative eff ect
28. Other common toxicities of fludarabine (< 10%) include 
edema, fever, chills, rash, pain, thrombocytopenia with a nadir of 16 days, malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, weakness, visual disturbances, sleep disorders, cough, dyspnea, and infection.  
 7.4 Interleukin -2  
The major physiologic role of IL- 2 is to promote the activation and proliferation of T and 
NK cells in an autocrine and paracrine manner 
29. It is secreted primarily by T cells in 
response to antigenic stimuli. Exposure of NK cells to IL- 2 results in proliferation, 
enhanced cytolytic activity and secretion of other cytokines. B cells also express intermediate affinity IL- 2 receptors and can secrete IL- 2 in cooperation with other 
cytokines, resulting in B cell proliferation and differentiation
30.  
 
Initial work by [CONTACT_489052]’s group at the NIH found that adoptively transferred IL-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the phenotype and functional  
characteristics of activated NK cells, supported with concomitant administration of IL- 2 
in high doses, resulted in significant tumor regression in patients selected for normal organ function and good performance status. Further investigation of these enc ouraging 
results suggested that therapeutic benefit could be seen in a subset of patients treated with high doses of IL- 2 alone. This led to clinical trials that demonstrated high- dose IL- 2 
induces objective clinical responses in 15 –20% of patients with advanced melanoma 
and durable complete responses in 5– 7% of these patients 
31,32. The NIH group has 
been consistently administering a cycle of high- dose IL- [ADDRESS_628388] space fluid accumulation.  In addition to hypotension, IL- 2 may also induce pulmonary 
edema, cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, reversible renal and hepatic dysfunction, pruritus, electrolyte abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, anemia and coagulopathy. IL- 2 
 
                      Page 15 
  can also cause constitutional symptoms such as fever, chill and fatigue, gastrointestinal 
side effects such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, transaminase elevation, cholestasis 
and diarrhea 33. Rarely , IL-2 may induce confusion, disorientation or visual 
hallucinations.  Although early studies with IL- 2 reported a 2% mortality rate, generally 
related to gram -positive sepsis, current IL- 2 centers that routinely use prophylactic 
antibiotics report no mortality 34-36. In experienced centers  such as University of 
Washington, IL -2-related toxicity can usually be easily managed and all side effects are 
reversible upon cessation of treatment.  
 
8.  INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
8.1  Tumor Acquisition and TIL Generation 
Once patients meet screening criteria for Step I, we will obtain a tumor specimen by a biopsy or surgery of a safely accessible melanoma lesion, ideally 2 cm
3. Whenever 
possible, this tumor will be acquired from a biopsy or surgery that is already being performed for medical reasons (e.g. to confirm metastatic disease or for palliation). Part of this tumor will be sent to pathology for diagnostic purposes, as well as additional immunohistochemical analysis to assess for prognostic features. If there is enough tissue, part of this tumor will be flash frozen and stored to enable future analysis.  TIL will be generated, tested, selected and expanded across the next [ADDRESS_628389] -expansion may also be 
removed for research purposes (e.g. immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], gene expression analysis.)  
 8.2.  Conditioning Regimen with Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine  
 
                      Page 16 
  Patient s will be admitted to the oncology inpatient service at the University of 
Washington Medical Center , or at the discretion of the PI, the outpatient 
Immunotherapy Service at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance on day -7. A PI[INVESTIGATOR_489017], largely in anticipation of high- dose IL- 2 
but also for the administration of chemotherapy 
and TIL. If the PI[INVESTIGATOR_489018], chemotherapy may be started using a peripheral IV and then switched to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_489019].  
 
On day - 7 and day -6, cyclophosphamide (Cy) 
at 12 0 mg/ kg will be administered intravenously 
in split dose s of 60  mg/kg/day x [ADDRESS_628390] Practice Policy guidelines, including IV hydration  and Mesna  therapy for 
uroprotection, will be followed.  
 
Fludarabine will be administered intravenously 
for 5 days from day -5 through day - 1, at a dose 
of 25mg/m2/day, and completed at least 24 
hours prior to T cell infusion.  
 
8.3  TIL infusion 
On day 0, patients will receive the TIL infusion at the University of Washington Medical Center  
or at the discretion of the PI, the outpatient 
Immunotherapy Service at Seattle Cancer Care 
Alliance . Patients will receive up to 1.5 x 10
11 
cells, depending on the number that is generated in the laboratory. The remainder will be cryopreserved for research purposes, but will not be infused at a later date. The TIL will be suspended in a 500cc bag of normal saline and infused intravenously over 45 minutes (+/- 
15 minutes) by a peripheral IV, a PI[INVESTIGATOR_489020]. The infusion bag will be 
gently mixed, approximately every [ADDRESS_628391] vital signs obtained pre-infusion, every 15 minutes during the infusion, at the end of the infusion and hourly 
for two hours following the infusion.  
 8.4  High -dose Interleukin 2  
Within 24 hours of the TIL infusion, the patient will be transferred to the hematology -
oncology intensive care unit  at UWMC and started on high- dose interleukin 2 at 
600,000 IU/kg as an IV bolus every eight hours up to a maximum of 14 doses, as 
tolerated, based on the High- Dose Interleukin- 2 Administration and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines currently used at the University of Washington (Appendix C). Once the patient develops toxicities, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_489021] a clinical 
decision when to stop interleukin- 2. This decision will be based on the Toxicity 
Management Guidelines.  
Figure 2. Investig ational Plan  
 
                      Page [ADDRESS_628392] supportive care will be provided 
including weaning off vasopressor support, discontinuing parenteral fluids, and monitoring. When the patient demonstrates hemodynamic stability and adequate pulmonary reserve, the patient will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], typi [INVESTIGATOR_223456] 3 -4 
days of oral diuretics and potassium as indicated.  
 8.5 Prophylaxis  
For all prophylactic medications below, dose adjustments and substitutions may be made if clinically warranted (e.g. drug allergy, renal impairment).  
 
8.5.1  Bacterial Prop hylaxis  
Patients will receive levofloxacin  500 mg daily , starting on day +0 or once ANC 
falls below 500/mm
3, whichever is sooner. Levofloxacin will be continued until 
ANC recovers to greater than 500/mm3.  
 
8.5.2  Pneumocystis Jiroveci  Pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis  
Patients will receive the fixed combination of trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) as double strength (DS) tablet [DS tabs = TMP 160 mg/tab and SMX 800 mg/tab ] po bid  on two consecutive days  a week.  
TMP/SMX -DS will be taken by [CONTACT_489053] -7 and continued for 6 
months after lymphodepletion.  Patients with sulfa allergies  may instead take 
dapsone 100mg po daily  or atovaquone 1500mg po daily, starting one week 
prior to lymphodepletion until 6 months after lymphodepletion.   
 
8.5.3  Herpes Simplex Virus  and Varicella Zoster Virus  Prophylaxis  
Patients with a positive HSV and/or positive VZV serology will be administered 
valacyclovir 500 mg po  bid, starting on day+0,  for 6 months .  If the patie nt 
cannot take oral medications, he will be given  acyclovir 5 mg/kg IVPB every 8 
hours, which is continued until absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1000/ml.  
 
8.5.4  Fungal Prophylaxis  
Patients will begin Fluconazole 200 mg po  daily, starting  on Day+0 or once ANC 
falls below 500/mm
3, whichever is sooner. Fluconazole will be continued for 2 
months after lymphodepletion.  
 
8.5.5  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_489022] ≥38.5 C with an ANC less than 500/mm3 will be 
treated on broad- spectrum an tibiotics per standard UW practice for neutropenic 
fever as appropriate to the patient’s signs and symptoms of infection.  Aminoglycosides should be avoided unless clear evidence of sepsis.  
 
8.5.6  Hematologic Support  
In order to reduce neutropenia following chemotherapy and T cell infusion, G -
CSF will be given at 5 μg/kg/day daily subcutaneously from Day +1 until 
neutrophil counts reach >500/mm
3x 3 days or >5000/mm3 x 1 day.  Using daily 
CBC’s as a guide, the patient will also receive platelets and packed red blood 
cells (PRBC’s) as needed.  Attempts  will be made to keep hemoglobin >8.0 g/dl, 
 
                      Page 18 
  and platelets >20,000/ml.    Leukocyte filters will be utilized for all blood and 
platelet transfusions to decrease sensitization to transfused WBC’s and decrease the risk of CMV infection.  Irradiated blood and blood products should be used.  
 8.[ADDRESS_628393] response, and this response remains stable 
until they ultimately experience disease progression. However, waiting for these patients to progress on BRAF/MEK inhibition  or requiring they discontinue BRAF/MEK 
inhibitors for an extended period is not ideal, because patients in these two situations 
often experience rapid disease progression that would preclude subsequent immunotherapy that could offer more durable disease c ontrol.  
 Therefore, for those patients who are currently on BRAF and MEK inhibitors and are experiencing a response that has stabilized (two consecutive scans spaced at least one month apart that show no further regression), concurrent treatment on BRAF/MEK inhibitors will be allowed with the following guidelines:  
 
• Patients must be off  BRAF/MEK inhibitors  for the 7 days prior to 
lymphodepletion.  
• Patients may resume BRAF/MEK inhibitors  no sooner than 7 days after 
the completion of IL- 2, as long as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_489023]’s clinical status at that time.  
• If the patient achieves a complete response after T cell therapy that lasts at least 6 months, the BRAF/MEK inhibitors  can be discontinued and a 
follow- up scan performed in 2- 3 months.  
• If the patient achieves a partial response or stable disease after T cell therapy , that is unchanged for at least 12 months and PET -negative, the 
BRAF/MEK inhibitors  can be discontinued and a follow -up scan 
performed in 2- [ADDRESS_628394] vital signs taken, a physical exam, a comprehensive chemistry panel and a complete blood count and differential at each planned visit, daily while the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] /clinic , weekly until 4 weeks after  the T cell infusion, and then on weeks 
6, 8, 12 and 24 (Appendix D). Of note, the dates listed on the study calendar are 
approximate as many patients may reside out of the area and cannot always follow the 
time points as dictated by [CONTACT_760] —however, patients must remain close to the 
study center until blood counts have recovered sufficiently to be at minimal risk of 
 
                      Page 19 
  infection or bleeding. All adverse events will be recorded and graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE v ersion 4.0.  
 
9.2  Immunologic Studies   
For evaluation of peripheral blood cells following T cell infusion, 60  ml of blood into 
yellow top tubes  (containing ACD solution ) should be drawn within 60 days after 
signing of step I consent , prior to re ceiving chemotherapy  on day - 7, prior to infusion  on 
day 0 , and then day  +1, +3, +7, +14,  +21 +28, +35, +42, +49, +56 (+/ - 3 days), and 
then week 12 and week 24, as well as any follow up visits when feasible.  These  dates 
are approximate as many of our patients reside out of the area and their oncologists and laboratories cannot always follow the time points as dictated by [CONTACT_760].  
Samples will be used to evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence, phenotype a nd 
function of infused TIL . Strategies for following in vivo persistence include deep 
sequencing of the T cell receptor CDR3 regions to follow frequencies of T cell populations , tetramer staining and ELISPOT analysis using melanoma peptide pools.  
 
9.3     Efficacy Assessment  
Radiographic imaging (CT, PET/CT or MRI) and clinical assessment of residual 
disease will be compared with pre- infusion assessment. This assessment will be 
performed at [ADDRESS_628395] version 1.1
37 definitions for CR, PR, SD and PD.  
 10. RE -TREATMENT  
 After TIL therapy, if a patient experiences disease control (complete response, partial response or stable disease) lasting 6 months, and then shows evidence of disease progression, and he experienced less than Grade III toxicity (except for the common expected toxicities listed below), the patient may be re- evaluated using the same 
screening procedures for re- treatment with TIL. The retreatment plan would be 
unchanged, with the same cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion regimen, TIL infusion and adjuvant high- dose IL- 2.  The patient would need to be re-
consented and meet all eligibility criteria, as before. The patient would need to undergo a repeat tumor biopsy to harvest TIL, unless there are sufficient TIL cryopreserved from the prior TIL culture for expansion (at least 40 x 10
6 cells).  
 
11. MANAGEMENT  OF TOXICITIES AND COMPLICATIONS  
  
11.1 Evaluation of  Toxicity  
Toxicity grading will be evaluated according to guidelines in NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0
38. The full text of the NCI CTCAE is available online at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/About.html . Toxicities will be monitored on a daily 
basis beginning at day -7 and continuing until discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489024]- 2 
infusion and then on subsequent follow up visits through day +42. The principal 
 
                      Page [ADDRESS_628396] () will be formed and meet after the treatment of the 5
th patient, the 15th patient or in the event of 2 or more unexpected, serious (CTCAE 
grade 3 or greater), treatment -related toxicities  or at least annually whichever is sooner . 
If the rate of unexpected, serious, treatment -related toxicities is observed in ≥ 33% of 
enrolled subjects in a cohort of [ADDRESS_628397] a 
thorough investigation of available safety data to justify to the DSMB a decision to continue enrolling new subjects into the study.  
  Serious adverse events (Appendix E) will be reported to the IRB and the FDA, in 
accordance with regulations detailed in the IND package.  
 11.2 Regimen -Related Toxicity  
If the patient develops an unexpected and serious toxicity attributable to the study regimen, the patient will not receive additional study treatment and a course of 
corticosteroids will be given if clinically indicated (see Section 11.3). A serious toxicity is defined as a non pre- existing Grade 3 or higher toxicity that develops after the start of 
treatment with the following exceptions:  
 Common and expected symptoms of chemotherapy and T cell infusion that are considered exceptions to criteria for discontinuation include:  
 A. For Cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day x 2 days and fludarabine 25mg/m
2/day x 5 
days, expected toxicities are:  
i. Non-life-threatening infections or febrile neutropenia (i.e. absence of 
hemodynamic compromise requiring vasopressor support)  
ii. WBC < 1000 (Grade 4 toxicity) for less than 4 weeks  
iii. ANC < 500 (Grade 4 toxicity) for less than 3 weeks  
iv. Lymphocytes < 500  (Grade 3 toxicity) for less than 3 weeks  
v. Platelets < 50,000 (Grade 3 or 4 toxicity) for less than 4 weeks  
vi. Hyperbilirubinemia and transaminase elevation (Grade 3 toxicity) that resolves within 3 weeks  
vii. Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (Grade 3 toxicity) that resolves within 3 weeks  
viii. Electrolyte and renal abnormality (Grade 3 toxicity) that resolves to Grade 1 or baseline within 3 weeks  
 
B.  Expected toxicities attributable to T cell infusions and considered exceptions to 
criteria for discontinuation include:  
i. Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) Grade 3 or less, including but not limited to asthenia, flu- like symptoms, myalgia, lymphopenia 
and rigors  
ii.       Skin rash/Erythroderma (Grade 3 toxicity)  
 
                      Page 21 
  iii. Hypoxemia requiring continuous oxygen, but not mechanical 
ventilation or intubation < 72 h  
iv.  Fever that resolves within 72h after cessation of IL-2 
v.  (Lymphocytes < 500)  (Grade 3 or 4 toxicity)  that resolves within 4 
weeks to baseline levels (pre- therapy)  
 
C. Expected toxicities attributable to high- dose IL- 2:  
A variety of side effects and toxicities have been associated with high- dose IL- 2  
administration; a list of these along with guidelines  for their management, which  
should be adjusted for the patient’s clinical condition, is listed in Appendix C.

(except as outlined for management of toxicity of TIL or physiologic doses for adrenal 
insufficiency ), chemotherapy that is not part of the treatment plan, other 
immunomodulatory agents, or any investigational agents, including unapproved BRAF 
inhibitors . Patients who are responding to vemurafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) at the time of 
enrollment on this trial may be allowed to resume vemurafenib ≥7 days after IL- 2 is 
completed (refer to Section 8.6 for conditions and guidelines for patients on vemurafenib).

example, voluntary withdrawal, toxicity, death) must be recorded on the case report form.  A subject may re- enter the study after premature disc ontinuation only by 
[CONTACT_489055].  If possible, final study evaluations should be completed at the time of discontinuation.  Potential reasons for premature discontinuation include:  
 
11.7.1  The development of a life- threatening infection.

12. GUIDELINES FOR ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING  
 12.1 Reporting of Adverse Events (AEs)  
 All unexpected and serious adverse events which may be due to study treatment or intervention must be reported to the FHCRC Institutional Review Office (IRO) per their current reporting requirements.  
 AEs of grade 3 or greater (per IRB policy 2.6. section 1.a.) will be collected through 4 
weeks after the T cell infusion. Beginning 4 weeks  after the T cell infusion, only study -
related toxicities will be collected.  
  All serious adverse events that are unexpected and related to study treatment will be report ed to the FDA on a MedWatch 3500 reporting form that will be submitted to the 
FDA within 15  calendar days. The reports will include the date and time of onset, 
severity and duration of the event, the relationship to study treatment, the treatment given, and the eventual outcome.  
 12.2 Definitions  
 
Definitions associated with reportable events can be found on the FHCRC IRO extranet 
website. (Relevant FHCRC policies include, but are not limited the documents  listed 
[Table 1]. Please also refer to the FHCRC IRO website.)

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
The primary endpoint of this study will be clinical response, to be assessed at 6, [ADDRESS_628403] ranged 
from 7% to 16%, we  previously  set a response rate of 20%  for this trial  as an informal 
benchmark that would support the clinical utility  of TIL as an additional  treatment  for 
melanoma . The original version of this protocol had a targeted accrual of 40 patients 
with a goal of showing a statistically significantly better response rate than the benchmark of 20%.  Accrual to this study, however, has been lower than hoped for and we therefore are modifying the study with a targeted accrual of [ADDRESS_628404] 
modified our benchmark from 20% to a new benchmark of 35% , to be comparable with 
the response rates seen from the PD -1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  from trials that 
included both treatment -naïve and previously treated melanoma  patient s, which reflects 
the patient groups eligible for this trial .
39-41  As a result of each of these changes, we will 
no longer require a statistically signi ficant improvement over the benchmark to deem 
this treatment as worthy of further study.  Instead, we shall consider the current treatment as worthy of further study if the observed response rate exceeds 35%.  If the 
true response rate is 40%, then the probability of an observed response rate in excess of 35% among 20 patients ( 7 or more responses among 20) is 0. 75; if the true response 
rate is 50 %, the probability is 0. 94.  As with the original version, secondary endpoints 
include in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells following TIL infusion and safety of the treatment protocol. Various markers will be examined for their association with response, among these % expression of central memory T cell markers, CD62L, CD27, and CD28.  Logistic regr ession will be used to assess these correlations.   
 The original version of this protocol specified that if  there are no responses observed 
after the first [ADDRESS_628405]  
 In accordance with federal regulations (21 CFR 312.66), an Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) that complies with regulations in [ADDRESS_628406] review and approve this protocol and the informed consent form prior to initiation of the study.  
 14.2  Termination of Study  
 The study will be stopped if any of the following events occur:  
 
 
                      Page 25 
  • A ll [ADDRESS_628407] completed treatment.  
 
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_489026]. Accrual will be put on hold pending 
discussion with the DSMB regarding whether a change in study design is 
warranted . 
 
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_489027]. The FDA may also 
terminate the study.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_628408] also be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without jeopardizing their future treatment.  In accordance with federal 
regulations (21 CFR 312), all patients must sign the IRB -approved consent form in the 
presence of a witness.  Prior to the start of the study, a copy of the IRB -approved 
consent form must be submitted to the Sponsor.

 The tumor sample obtained for the generation of TIL will be dissected into a goal of 24 fragments, 1- 3mm

containing IL- 2. The remaining tumor will be processed into a single cell suspension and 
then cryopreserved for later use as autologous tumor target cell s for TIL testing.  
 The fragments are cultured in the wells, and inspected every few days for growth and evidence of contamination. Once the wells reach confluence, they are resuspended, counted and split into wells at a concentration of 1- 1.5x10

  APPENDIX C  
ADMINISTRATION AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR HIGH- DOSE 
INTERLE[LOCATION_006]IN-2  
 (Adapted from University of Washington High- Dose IL- 2 Administration and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines)  
 1) OVERVIEW  
HDIL -2 is administered in 8 -hour intervals as tolerated to a maximum of 1 4 doses. 
Doses that are skipped for management of toxici ties are not compensated by 
[CONTACT_489056], are not reduced , and are generally intended to be given at 
approximately 8-h our intervals.  As a general rule, if a patient has severe enough 
toxicity to withhold 2 or more consecutive doses , the IL -2 will be discontinued.  
 2) SPECIFIC TOXICITIES AND CORRECTIVE INTERVENTION  
 A. Hemodynamics  
 
 Hypotension  
 
• IV Fluids  
 
Upon admission for HDIL- 2 treatment, patients should be started on maintenance 
intravenous fluids in anticipation of ensuing capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], vasodilation 
and decreased systemic vascular resistance.  Colloid has no advantage over crystalloid, even when the albumin falls, and D5LR at 100cc/hr is recommended. Bolus IV fluids and increase in the continuous IV rate may be of value for initial management of hypotension to keep MAP > 60, attempting to limit the cumulative positive fluid balance by [CONTACT_5638] 5 days to no more than 10% of the patient’s 
dry weight by [CONTACT_489057] 5- day cycle of HDIL -2.  This is accomplished by 
[CONTACT_489058], depending on the patient’s hemodynamic status, renal function, acid- base balance and pulmonary 
reserve.     
 
• Vasopressor agents  
 
If hypotension persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_489030], vasopressor support 
with an α -sympathomimetic agent (generally phenylephrine) is indicated. Titration 
of phenylephrine should be between 0.5 and 2mcg/kg/min to keep the systolic 
blood pressure over 80 -90 mm Hg (MAP > 60). Since the BP nadir tends to occur 
4-6 hours after each dose of HDIL- 2, a “reserve” should be available in the 
vasopressor dose, so that additional doses of HDIL- 2 should be given only if the 
phenylephrine dose can be weaned to below about 1 mcg/kg/minute before the next IL- 2 dose.  
   
 
                      Page 32 
  B. Renal  
 
 Oliguria  
 
Oliguria is universal and is due to the combination of hypotension/hypoperfusion 
and decreased intravascular volume.  It may be amplified in uninephric patients and patients on vasopressors.  Oliguria per se is not an indication for fluids or diuresis; a bladder scan or urinary catheter may be useful to better assess the renal status if the patient is anuric, acidotic or has  other reasons for urinary 
retention.  
 
C. Pulmonary  
 
 Hypoxia  
 
The need for supplemental oxygen will vary among patients depending on their underlying lung function and disease. Supplemental oxygen should be used to keep the patient’s oxygen saturation > 90- 92%, and intravenous volume should 
be limited in patients whose oxygenation is difficult to maintain and in those with significant crackles and/or chest radiographic findings of pulmonary edema or significant pleural effusion.  
 
 Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema  
 
Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is extremely rare in patients receiving HDIL -2 
since patients are well screened and HDIL- 2 rarely causes global 
cardiomyopathy. Any patient with sudden pulmonary decompensation should be evaluated for causes of cardiac origin.   
 
D. Cardiac  
 
 Ischemia 
 
Cardiac ischemia is also rare, but occasional focal myocarditis may occur, and arrhythmias or evidence of ischemia on EKG may mandate discontinuation of HDIL -2. 
 
 Cardiac Arrhythmias  
 
Atrial cardiac arrhythmias during HDIL- 2 treatment are uncommon, but 
occasionally supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation may be seen. Careful assessment should be performed for supervening causes such as 
ischemia, myocarditis, pericardial effusion or pulmonary events. Treatment 
should include antiarrhythmic medications, and does not preclude continuation of HDIL -2.  Serious ventricular arrhythmias are rare and warrant discontinuation of 
HDIL -2 and resumption only if a minor, reversible/treatable cause was found.  
  
 
                      Page 33 
   Edema 
 
Although patients often experience moderate amounts of peripheral edema at the 
end of each cycle, it is rare that they will experience severe symptoms from this extravascular fluid accumulation. Patients should be aggressively diuresed at the end of each cycle once they are hemodynamically stable.  
 
E. Fever  
 
Blood cultures will be drawn for all patients with fever (temperature > 38.5 C) and antibiotic prophylaxis will be given according to SPP guidelines associated 
with IL -2 therapy and neutropenia.  
 
3) ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES  
Organ- by-organ guidelines for IL- [ADDRESS_628417] be individualized and considered in the 
context of the whole patient rather than in isolation.  Each dose should be given or withheld after an assessment of the patient by [CONTACT_489059], as supervised 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_489031].

 6) MONITORING  
 
1) Monitoring guidelines : ICU routine  
 2) Labs  for IL -2 monitoring: According to UWMC standard of care for high- dose IL-[ADDRESS_628420] 
infusion, it is usually sufficient to wean the patient off pressors as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_489034], followed by [CONTACT_489060] (depending on the patient’s particular hemodynamic needs and volume status) prompt discontinuation of parenteral fluids and then active diuresis.  Patients should have sufficient pulmonary reserve at the time of discharge to tolerate the possibility of mobilizing a few liters back into the vascular space (which can result in pulmonary edema) AND should be given at least 3- 4 days of oral diuretics, with 
K as indicated, to return them to near dry weight (which is likely to be about 2- 3 kg 
below their prior weight).  Patients can stop the diuretics on their own when their weight normalizes and/or edema resolves.  All patients experience desquamation and dry, 
pruritic skin, which is managed symptomatically with lubricants and anti -pruritics 
(avoiding steroid).

APPENDIX E 
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
Primary Monitoring  The principal investigator (PI) will be responsible for monitoring the data and toxicities to identify trends, and for revising the protocol as needed to maintain safety . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_489035], that the monitoring plan is being followed, and that all adverse events are reported according to protocol guidelines.  
  Data and  Safety Monitoring Board 
 A dedicated data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be formed to review the conduct of the trial to date and assess the safety and toxicity of the study intervention. At each meeting, all grade III or greater toxicities as defined by [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 4.0 of NCI Common Toxicity Criteria will be reviewed. The DSMB will determine if the study should be prematurely discontinued due to excessive toxicity or if a change in study design is warranted.  
  DSMB Meeting S chedule  
 The DSMB will meet after the treatment of the 5
th patient, the 15th patient  or if there are 
≥2 unexpected, serious, treatment -related toxicities (see Section 11.2 for definitions)  or 
at least annually whichever is sooner .  
 
As described in Section 11, if the rate of unexpected, serious, treatment -related 
toxicities is observed in ≥  33% of enrolled subjects in a cohort of [ADDRESS_628422] with minutes for the DSMB meeting. A report from the 
DSMB is submitted to the FHCRC IRB  and Regulatory Affairs Manager .  The FHCRC 
also has a Protocol Data Monitoring Committee (PDMC) that reviews the progress of the protocol with respect to the monitoring plan at the time of each annual renewal.  As with initial review, annual IRB review and approval is also required.

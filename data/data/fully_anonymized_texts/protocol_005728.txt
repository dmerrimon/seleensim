II. Glossary of Definitions and Terms  
 
 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): a disorder in which the airway collapses, either 
completely or partially, repeatedly during the night and is associated with oxygen desaturation, sleep fragmentation, and daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
 Snoring:  a snorting or grunting sound in a person's breathing while asleep (Oxford 
Dictionary)   
 
AHI: an index  used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by [CONTACT_130752]. The hypopneas  (pauses in 
breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and be associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation or an arousal from sleep.  
 CPAP:  Continuous positive airway pressure, colloquially often used to refer to a 
machine which uses an increase of air pressure to keep an airway open in someone who has OSA  
 EDC:  Elect ronic Data Capture, a system to record clinical data in an electronic manner 
and which is auditable.

III. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
A. Clinical Significance : 
Snoring is defined as a coarse, harsh sound caused by [CONTACT_130753], uvula, and tongue 
base. Habitual snoring is common, but prevalence varies widely 15- 54% ( [1-5]). In looking 
at differences in sex,  44% of men snore and 28% of women snore [5].  Common 
correlations  with snoring include age, being overweight, nasal and sinus problems, 
alcohol intake, smoking, certain medications, and sleep position.  
 
Snoring is a common sign of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ; however many cases of 
snoring are unrelated to OSA.  This is known as simple or primary snoring. I f one removes 
those who have an Apnea Hypopnea Index ( AHI) greater than five, prevalence of primary 
snoring is approximately 42% in both men and women [5]  (calculated from Table 3 of 
reference) . In these cases, the sleep of the primary snorer is less likely affected, thereby 
[CONTACT_130754] . Bed par tners of snorers 
frequently suffer from poor sleep quality and even possible hearing loss due to the disturbance [6]. Furthermore , this poor sleep quality leads to excessive daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_130736] [ 5]. 
 
The biomechanics o f snoring is interesting ; from a theoretical perspective it can be 
modeled as “coupled oscillation of the walls of the airway with airflow through it” [1] . 
Specifically , snoring occurs when airflow becomes unstable over a flexible structure.  
Anatomically , there are a few places where the sound can originate,  most notably the 
pharynx , and soft palate (tonsil, velar, tongue) [1, 3, 7 ].  These locations can have 
different acoustic signatures  [3, 7]  and may require different solutions to resolve.  
 
Due to the multiple etiologies of a snore,  many anti -snoring solutions exist.  They  
include (but are not limited to) oropharyngeal exercises [8],  pharmacologic solutions [9], 
nasal dilators [10-14], positional trainers [15, 16] , and mandibular advancement (also 
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ZIP_CODE]                 Confidential  
Rev 3.0                 Page 10 of 35 
 
known as oral appliances)  [16-20]. Even CPAP has been used to treat primary snoring 
[21].   
 
Primary snoring itself is not considered a medical condition per say, thus these 
solutions are not always considered medical devices.  Hence,  concerned snorers may 
or may not be deal ing with the condition under council of a physician and would not 
necessarily know what the source of the snoring is .  Therefore concerned snorers  often  
blindly use a “trial and error” approach to select an anti -snoring solution. This method is 
often expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful  [22].   
 
A previous cli nical study conducted at Philips, C AI-[ZIP_CODE]- SNOPI L-KD, attempted to  
systematically move participants through a decision tree (Philips study algorithm) and 
understand the sleep disturbance of bed partners who use the anti-snoring  solutions  
recommended by [CONTACT_3433] e decision tree.  The study algorithm would recommend one of 
three snoring solutions (Mute, myTAP , Pose  [analogous to SPT] ) based upon a three 
question questionnaire. Then , based upon usage and perceived snoring reduction, 
combinations of products would be recommended at subsequent visits.  It was 
hypothesized that 60% of the couples  in the study would see a measurable reduction in 
partner’s sleep disturbance.   
 
For the study , 33 couples were enrolled, 32 couples finished the study.  The bed 
partners’ average sleep disturbance due to snoring (the primary outcome from this trial) 
went from 7.6, on a 0- 10 scale, to a 2.8 at study’s  end.  Further, 72% of bed partners 
agreed that the trial reduced their partner’s snoring , but only 42% felt it stopped the 
snoring completely .  However, to achieve this outcome, the study algorithm took 5 
weeks and 64% of snorers ended up on a device combination of the two most 
expensive snoring solutions  [23].  Finally, this trial and market research rejected the  
business model  proposed by  [CONTACT_20767]’s Philips study algorithm .  Consumers favor an 
approach that “gets its right the first time” and may be willing to pay for a personalized 
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ZIP_CODE]                 Confidential  
Rev 3.0                 Page 11 of 35 
 
recommendation on anti -snoring solution if their/bed partn er’s snoring is reduced by 
50% [22]. 
 
Therefore, i n order to help the co ncerned snorer find a solution,  more data must be 
gathered.  There is a need to assess the same three interventions ( Mute, myTAP , and 
Sleep Position Trainer [SPT]  [see section III.B.])  in order to understand how well each 
intervention works in a specific individual.  Then, there is a hope to cluster the 
individuals based upon intervention success to understand what questions can be 
asked a priori  that would predict an intervention’s suc cess.  Thus,  there is a hope to 
redesign the intake questionnaire for the SilentNight  app, ensuring that the right product 
is recommended from the start and a “trial and error” approach  (as the prior study 
algorithm used) is not needed.  
 
Lastly, there is also a desire to develop an audio detection of snoring to create a “snore 
score,” a numerical representation of how someone snored during the night.  It is also in 
the development pi[INVESTIGATOR_130737]’s 
problem.  Prior studies have looked at audio of snoring both in a lab setting [24 -26] and 
while patients were in drug induced sleep [7, 27] .  For example,  it has been shown that 
tongue based snoring has a frequency above 500 H z. whereas palatial snoring is below 
500 Hz.  However, little “in the wild” data exists.  So,  while it may be theoretically 
possible to phenotype a snore based upon audio, it is still unknown if it is practical to 
phenotype a snore using audio recorded in a user’s bedroom.  
 
B. Description of Intervention Studied:   
We will use three different anti -snoring devices which target different sources of 
snoring. All study devices are single patient use. One is currently marketed in the US 
while the other two are investigational.  In addition, we will use an audio recording 
device to record room sounds for product development of a snore detection app.

1. Mute nasal device (RhinoMed, Richmond, Victoria 3121, Australia)   
Mute is a pair of nasal dilators that fit snugly in the nose of the snorer dilating the 
nostrils to help reduce or eliminate snoring. This is an over -the-counter (OTC) product 
and is cleared by [CONTACT_130755]. The introduction video for Mute is 
located at http://mutesnoring.com/how -to-use/. 
 
Nasal dilators have been used to treat snoring and sleep apnea [10 -13].  Many st udies 
focus on external nasal dilators like Breath e Right Strips.  These interventions largely 
were not effective in treating OSA [10] .  However, there is some evidence to suggest 
internal to the nose dilator s (like Mute) may work to reduce snoring.  A small study 
(n=11) using Nozovent, showed that there was substantial decreasing in snoring noise 
in all patients studied [13] .  Also  a white paper from RhinoMed claims that 73% of bed 
partners reported a reduction in snoring severity [28] . 
 
2. myTAP™  V (Airway Management, Carrollton, TX)   
For purposes of this trial, we will be using an investigational myTAP V, which is not 
available for commercial use.  The changes from the released product are: a vertical 
offset (+3mm) has been added to the design of the adjustment post and mechanism to improve overall comfort . 
 myTAP
TM is a man dibular advancement device used for snoring relief. The product 
requires a prescription and is cleared by [CONTACT_130755]. The 
introduction video for myTAP™ is located at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehVZf1b2wi0.    
 
Mandibular advancement devices have shown to be effective, but not necessarily acceptable to primary snorers [16-20].

3. Sleep Positio nal Trainer  (SPT)  (NightBalance, Delft, 
Netherlands)  
Sleep Positional Trainer (SPT)  is a small device worn around the chest with an 
ergonomic band that continuously monitors the sleep position of the snorer. When the 
snorer is supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], it emits a gentle vibration to remind them to turn to the side to help 
reduce or eliminate their snoring.   It is not available in the [LOCATION_002] and therefore is 
considered investigational use as part of this study. Though t his product is available in 
various European countries including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, [LOCATION_009], Ireland, The 
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.  The instruction video for NightBalance 
SPT is located at http://www.nightbalance.com/product -support/ .   
 
Studies have shown mixed results for positional therapy as a whole [15].  Braver and 
Block reported that foam wedges used to keep patients in a lateral position were not 
effective in reducing snoring in 20 individuals [29] .  But Choi et al successfully treated 
[ADDRESS_147817] reducing snoring rate from 36.7% to 15.7% [30 ].  In 
a far more extensive study of OSA patents , Benoist et al tested a NightBalance product 
specifically [16].  In a sample of [ADDRESS_147818] 90%. Th erefore, it can be hypothesized that the SPT  will also be effective for 
positional primary snoring.  
 
4. Philips SilentNight  Mobile Application  
Philips SilentNight  application is an audio recording application for the collection of 
snoring sounds. It may also be used to collect questionnaire data. The app complies 
with applicable privacy and security standards for clinical research activities. The app’s 
functionalit y is limited and data will be contained on the phone . At each visit in the trial , 
data will be removed from the phone by a member of Philips staff.  Wire frame of the app is shown in Appendix I. 
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ADDRESS_147819] ly, while each of the interventions to be studied 
are known to be effective for snoring cessation, each is not fully effective in the total 
population. Each intervention’s efficacy on a given individual is predicated  by [CONTACT_130756]’s physiology and their  contributing factors to their snoring .  In order to improve 
the SilentNight recommendation algorithm , more information needs to be gathered.  By 
[CONTACT_7939] a battery of questions of a snorer and having them trial all three snoring solutions , it may be possible to understand the comparative effectiveness of each 
solution,  the user acceptance of each solution,  and which questions should be used to 
discern an acceptable and effective solut ion for a given individual.  
 Secondly , it is a long -term development goal of the SilentNight program to use audio 
analysis  of a snore in order to make product recommendations .  This protocol is 
designed to collect “in the wild” audio of snoring.  The goal of this data collection is to 
identify  unique characteristics in the sound recording. These , paired with the answers to 
the intake questions and the relative effectiveness of the three anti -snoring solutions  
could phenotype the snore and snorer.   This audi o data could also be used to develop

Rev 3.0                 Page 15 of 35 
 
or refine a “snore score”, a semi -objective assessment of snoring audio which can be 
calculated daily . 
 
B. Primary Aim  
Understand the comparative effectiveness of three different anti- snoring solutions  and 
determine which is/are the correct solution for a given individual.  
 
We expect there to be a different effectiveness of each of the three anti -snoring 
solutions over the entire population studied.  However, there is no hypothesis as to which will be most effective.  Rather it is a goal to understand what the best solution is 
for a given individual, and generalize this finding to a larger population.  
 C. Secondary Aims  
1. Understand user acceptance of each solution . 
2. Collect audio data of snoring in  different individuals in a baseline setting 
and using various anti -snoring solutions.  
 
All secondary aims are information gathering.  There is no hypothesis to test.  
 
V. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
A. Design  
 
This is an open- label crossover, comparative effectiv eness trial.   
 
B. Study Design Rationale  
 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  As  each participant will serve as their own control, our 
enrollment size can be kept small.  Thus, this is a feasibility study utilizing  a small 
number of patients.  No previous data exist  for power calculations. The results 
may also provide statistical justification for later studies.  Also,  being a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , there 
are no procedures taken to avoid bias , such as rand omization or blinding.   This is 
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ADDRESS_147820] 25 completing the study. We will 
attempt to study an equal number of men and women.   Participants will be 
enrolled in the study for up to 40  days.  
 
Potential participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_130757]  
(Campos Inc., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA) , either from their existing  database, word of 
mouth , or through media advertisements (e.g . Craigslist, local newspapers, 
flyers , targeted F acebook advertisements,  institutional postings ).  These ads will  
be used to identify participants with a history of snoring  and their troubled 
bedpartner . Participants at high risk for sleep apnea will be excluded from the 
study, as determined by [CONTACT_130758] [31] and OSA50 [32] 
questionnaires  (Appendix II) ident ified through a phone screening  (Appendix III) .

3. Visit 1 , Intake  inter view, baseline questionnaires:  
 
The recruited couple will be asked to come  to the Philips facility , or other 3rd party 
location (Campos, or nearby [CONTACT_130761]) .  After both participants are consented 
to the study procedure, eligibility will be reviewed, including an OSA screening 
questionnaire (snorer only).  Demographic data will be collected. The snorer will have a 
baseline assessment including, STOP -BANG (Appendix XIV), medical history, a review 
of current medications, anthropometric measurements  (height, weight, neck 
circumference) , and BMI.  A phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_130740] ( Appendix IV ). The couple will be interviewed by [CONTACT_130762] a semi structured interview style ( Appendix V and Appendix VI ). 
These interviews may be a udio recorded (with participant consent), and stored for  up to 
[ADDRESS_147822] their snoring every night and answer the questionnaire every morning.  During the trial period, the bed partner is 
instructed to sleep in the same room with the snorer in order to provide feedback about 
their sleep.  
 Finally, they will be given a “trial pack” of the Mute devices.  Instructions for use for the 
Mute device will be reviewed, and study procedures will be reiterated (app  usage, 
nightly rec ording and morning questions).   The entire visit will take approximately 1 
hour.  
 
4. Baseline Nights  (3 nights)  
 
Participants will record three nights of baseline snoring. No intervention will be used on 
these nights.  In the morning , both the snorer and bed partner will fill out the daily 
questionnaire (Appendix VII) in the app on the mobile device.  
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ZIP_CODE]                 Confidential  
Rev 3.0                 Page 21 of 35 
 
 
5. Phone Call 1  
 
On day three of the study, participants will be contact[CONTACT_130763], reminding them to 
start using the Mute.  The Philips team  will check in to see if there are any issues with 
the app, and they will also remind them of the upcoming visits to the Philips designated facility.  
 
6. Intervention Nights Set 1 (Mute)  ~ [ADDRESS_147823] cross over  
Approximately 1- 2 weeks after the initial visit participants will be called 30 min interview .   
 
The snorer and bedpartner will be interviewed separately again using the guided 
interview technique.  They will be asked questions regarding the use of the Mute device, their perception of snoring, and sleep quality. The interviews will follow a script 
attached as appendices VIII and IX .  These interviews may be audio recorded (with 
participant consent), and stored for up to [ADDRESS_147824], and a set of instructions.  They will be 
asked to view the video on how to f it the myTAP which is included in the consent form.  
They will also be sent a questionnaire specific to the myTAP V fitting, which they will 
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ADDRESS_147825] after fitting, and partly after the approximately 2 weeks of 
use. 
 
8. Intervention Nights Set 2 (myTAP  V) ~ 2 weeks   
 
Prior to the set of intervention nights, the snorer will  follow the instructions and fit the 
myTAP  V device themselves using the “boil and bite” technique (See Appendix X for 
more information) .  After fitting they will need to complete Q1 of the myTAP V 
questionnaire (Appendix XIII).  They will utilize the device at night.  They will have the 
opportunity to titrate the mandibular advancement per the study instructions for use 
(Appendix X), in order to gradually get used to the d evice, and potentially improve 
effectiveness.   At the end of their myTAP V use, they will complete the remainder of 
Appendix XIII.  
 If they have any concern over use of the myTAP  V device,  or note any discomfort they 
are to stop its use and call Philips.  They may be instructed to discontinue the use of 
myTAP  V all together, or make some adjustments.  All will be at discretion of the PI.  
 Regardless of device usage, the bed partner will be instructed to sleep in the same 
room as the snorer.  Participants will record room noise during the night. In the morning both the snorer and bed partner will fill out the daily questionnaire on the phone.  
 
9. Visit 2 2nd cross over  
 
Approximately 2- 3 weeks after Phone Call 2 (1st crossover)  and 3- 4 weeks after the 
initial visit 1, participants will return for an approximately 30 min  visit.  They will bring 
both the myTAP  V device and mobile device with the SilentNight  application.  Data from 
the mobile device will be downloaded off of the phone.  A groupi[INVESTIGATOR_130741]  V device will be taken and the investigational device returned to Philips .

Rev 3.0                 Page 23 of 35 
 
Participants will report what size of Mute device they used for th e week of use.  They 
then will be assessed using the Mute online snoring guide ( https://mutesnoring.com/wp-
content/uploads/2016/11/Mute_online_sizing_guide2.pd f), in order to confirm they used 
the proper size.  
 
Next, the snorer and bedpartner will be interviewed separately , again using the guided 
interview technique.  They will be asked questions regarding t he use of the myTAP  V 
device, their perception of snori ng, and sleep quality.  The interviews w ill follow a script 
attached as appendices VIII  and IX .  These interviews may be audio recorded (with 
participant consent), and stored for up to 6 months.   The bed partner interview may be 
conducted over the phone.  
 
Finally, they will be given sizing information for the SPT device and will choose a size.  
Instructions for use for the SPT device will be reviewed, and study procedures will be 
reiterated (app usage, nightly recording and morning questions).  
 
10. Intervention  Nights Set 3 ( SPT) 
Snorer s will be asked to wear the SPT device for two week s.  The first few nights will be 
the normal calibration period with the device, and the second week will be full sleep 
training mode.   The titration of the device will be as follows:

11. Visit 3 Exit interview   
Approximately 5- 6 weeks after the initial visit (~2 weeks after visit 3) participants will 
return for an approximately 1 hour visit.  They will bring the mobile device with the 
SilentNight  application .  Data from the mobile device will be downloaded off of the 
phone.  
 
Next, the snorer and bedpartner will be interviewed separately again using the guided 
interview technique.  They will be asked questions regarding the use of the SPT device, 
their perception of snoring and sleep quality. The interviews will follo w a script attached 
as appendices VIII and IX .  These interviews may be audio recorded (with participant 
consent), and stored for up to [ADDRESS_147827] of the investigational materials  (mobile device and SPT) from the study 
will be collected.  The participant may dispose of the Mute device if they desire.  Data from the SPT device may be downloaded, by [CONTACT_130764].  
 
12. Marketing continuation   
 
After the exit interview, we will ask participants  their permission for Philips to follow up 
with them at any time in the 3 months following the study ’s end.  This will be a purely 
marketing effort.   As such, after Visit 5 participants will be considered exited, and 
adverse events will no longer be tracked.  The follow up will be useful after the data

I. Participant compensation 
 
The couples  will be compensated for their time in the study as well as incentivized to 
provide data recordings and daily survey answers.  The latter incentive in no way 
reflects their use of any of the products in the study, participants can stop their use at 
any tim e.  However, in a prior study  CAI-[ZIP_CODE]- SNOPIL -KD there was issue with 
collection of recordings.   Further couples will still be paid a base of 25 dollars a week 
regardless of recording etc.  Couples  may withdraw at any point and compensation will 
be prorated at that time.  In total the enrolled couple  could earn up to $1000 dollars.

VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
A. Determination of Sample Size  
Thirty  couples  may be enrolled in order to ensure [ADDRESS_147829] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.  
Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages.  Endpoints will be 
compared between conditions to assess algorithm performance.  Any formal 
significance testing will be performed at p < 0.05.  
 
C. Subjec t Disposition  
Subject disposition, including the total number of participant’s enrolled, completed, early 
terminations and withdrawal will be presented in the analysis. In addition, a listing will 
be provided with the reasons for discontinuation.  
 
D. Demogra phics and Baseline Characteristics  
These data will be collected and summarized with descriptive statistics.  
 
E. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint will be the daily rating of snoring sever ity as rated by [CONTACT_130766].  The daily responses will be averaged on a weekly basis.  Due to titration and 
acclimation during the 9 nights of use nights 10- 14 of myTAP  V and SPT use will be 
compared to the week of Mute use.  If formal statistical comparisons are performed, continuous data will be compared bet ween the three therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130742]-
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ADDRESS_147830] -hoc pairwise tests will 
be done with a suitable adjustment for multiple comparisons.  Categorical data will be 
compared between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130743]’s Q test.  
 Other analysis may be conducted looking at trends, or groupi[INVESTIGATOR_130744].   
 
F. Secondary Analysis  
Also studied will be endpoints such as snorer perception of their sleep and 
Bed partner perception of sleep  quality , subjective acceptability of the solutions, etc. 
 
G. Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_99492] (Baseline characteristics, audio file analysis)  
A cluster analysis will then be performed on the baseline questionnaire data to determine if effective and acceptable snoring solutions can be recommended based on 
simple questionnaire data. Similarly, a cluster analysis will also be performed on the basel ine audio data in order to determine if effective snoring solutions can be 
recommended based on audio data or audio and questionnaire data.  
 
H. Study Termination Criteria  
 
Due to the small sample size,  there are no a priori  criteria for the termination of the 
study, nor is there a need for sensitivity analysis  
 
I. Safety Analysis 
Safety evaluations will be performed by [CONTACT_130767].  Adverse events will be provided in data listings.  
A complete medical history will be obtained at screening, and subjects having any of the outlined exclusion criteria will be immediately discontinued.  
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ADDRESS_147831]. If the participant experiences pressure from the band, it can be slightly adjusted to increase 
comfort. Participants can also wear the band over c ommon sleepwear to minimize any 
discomfort. 
 
 
Possible side effects of the myTAP V include:  
• Slight tooth or gingival discomfort due to pressure from the appliance.  
• Excess salivation initially. This will improve as you become accustomed to wearing the 
myTAP  V 
• Slight jaw soreness or tightness, initially and with adjustments.  
• Temporary bite change. This may subside approximately 30 minutes after the myTAP  V is 
taken out of the mouth in the morning.  
• Unconsciously taking the myTAP V out of your mouth at night.  
• Movement of teeth.  
• Pain in the jaw joint.  
• Permanent bite change.  
• Mouth dryness –  the mouth shield accessory can help prevent dryness.  
 
Furthering the risk of the myTAP  V product, will be its use in an in home setting, and not 
being fitted by a trained specialist (i .e. dental hygienist, sleep technologist, dentist etc.).  
The product is commonly sold as an over the counter  product  in other markets, and 
there is a desire to see if this model can work with SilentNight.  Therefore, participants 
will be given instructions and tips and tricks prior to fitting the device themselves.  
 
  
 
Protocol# SRC -AI-SilentNight -[ADDRESS_147832] data not related to the study (secondary data) which may include the potential of recording personal and sensitive data. It is recommended that 
this data  be deleted and/or not stored with the recording and additionally removed from 
any retention of the recording for other research uses and purposes.  
 Both participants may experience difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_130745].  
 
 
B. Potential Benefits  
There are no direct benefits to participants in this study. It is possible that one or more 
of the interventions will prove to be effective at reducing the snoring disturbance.  It is 
hoped that the results of this study will lead to new treatment strategies for snoring.  
 
C. Confidentiality  
Privacy rules and requirements according to governing regulations will be implemented. All the information collected as part of this study will be kept confidential. All information 
collected for this study will be kept in a secured area or stored in a password protected 
computer if digital. Except when required by [CONTACT_2371], participants will not be identified by 
[CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, telephone number, or any other direct personal 
identifier in study records. For records disclosed outside Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770], participants will 
be assigned a unique code number.  The key to the code will be kept by [CONTACT_1275]. Data will be managed by [CONTACT_130768].

• Noncompliance.  
• At the request of the participant.  
• It the discretion of the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_130746]/she believes continuing with 
the protocol is not in the best interest of the subject.  
 
The study coordinator will document whether or not each participant completed the 
study.  If, for any participant, study treatment or assessments were discontinued, the 
reason will be recorded.  
 The study goal is to have [ADDRESS_147833] (IRB) 
by [CONTACT_1034]. Serious adverse events will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of the study team being aware of the event. For each adverse event, the i nvestigator 
will provide the onset, duration, intensity and treatment required, outcome and action 
taken. We anticipate that adverse events during this study would be related to device 
usage.  Discomfort or pain in the jaw/mouth while using the myT AP V may occur . All 
reasonable care will be taken to avoid these complications. All data will be kept confidential and in a locked cabinet. Only approved study personnel will have access to 
study related documents.  
 All device deficiencies, use or user errors, and equipment failures will be documented.  
Use or User errors will be captured as part of the source documentation.  Device deficiencies and equipment failures will be kept on a separate log.  The serial numbers 
and type of defici ency/failure will be capture d.

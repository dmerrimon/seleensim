Randomized Comparative  Evaluation of  Midline Catheters for thrombophlebitis 
 
Introduction   
  
Establishment and maintenance of  intravenous (IV)  access  are core processes in  
providing  medical  care for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51379]. For patients requiring extended 
duration of  therapy, the peripherally inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) Team is  often 
consulted for patient assessment and vascular  access  device placement at  many 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. PI[INVESTIGATOR_236166]-term central or  peripheral infusion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_236167] a critical care setting. Although PI[INVESTIGATOR_236168] a great option for some 
patients, these  catheters have known complications including catheter- related  
bloodstream infection, catheter-related venous  thrombosis, malfunction,  
and high  cost. Midline catheters represent  a potentially attr active alternative to   
PI[INVESTIGATOR_236169]. These catheters have been utilized since  the mid  
1980s  but  fell out of  favor  in the early 1990s  due to reports of  acute life threatening 
hypersensit ivity reactions. In the last  few years, midlines  have made a resurgence in 
the market and are FDA cleared  for use in patients requiring intermediate  to long- 
term infusion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Advances  in midline catheters offer the potential for reduced 
complications. As midlines  have increased in popularity and new midlines  have been 
introduced  into the market,  it is  necessary to better  understand complication profiles 
of various  midline catheters, as it is  likely that  all c atheters are not created  equal. 
Specifically, the incidence  of symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis is  of interest. 
While this complication has been researched extensively for PI[INVESTIGATOR_236170]  
1.8 – 8.4%, data  on this complication for midlines  represents  a gap  in the literature. 
One recent  publication cited a 4.5%  rate  of all symptomatic catheter-related venous  
thrombosis (combined  superficial venous  thrombosis (SVT) and deep venous  
thrombosis (DVT))  in patients with  midline catheters. Another  study found  a catheter-
related  venous  thrombosis rate  of 2.5%  when limiting  measured outcomes to 
occurrence of  DVT . Internal  retrospective  
data  at our  institution suggests a rate  closer  to 1 2-15% for all symptomatic catheter-
related  venous  thrombosis (SVT and DVT). Some midline catheters are coated to 
provide protection against  cathete r-related venous  thrombosis and/or catheter-
related bloodstream infection. The  theoretical  benefit (s) of these  catheters need  
further validation  in human subjects.  
  
Objective   
  
We aim to understand the difference  in symptomatic catheter-related upper extremity 
venous  thrombosis (CR-UEVT) comparing the Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advance 4.5  F 
single lumen midline catheter to the AngioDynamics  BioFlo 4 F single lumen midline 
catheter. Both catheters are inserted using a modified  seldinger  technique (MST). The  
AngioDynamics  product  has Endexo technology with  claims  of reduced platelet  
aggregation and favorable thrombus accumulation profile. The  Teleflex catheter is  a 
chlorhexidine coated device that  claims  to be both  antithrombogenic and 
antimicrobial.

Specific Aim 1:  To compare  incidence of  symptomatic CR-UEVT between the 
AngioDynamics  Bioflo midline catheter and the Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advance 
midline catheter.  
  
For Aim 1, we will measure  incidence of  all symptomatic CR-UEVT inclusive of    
superficial thrombophlebitis (SVT) and deep venous  thrombosis (DVT) confirmed  by 
[CONTACT_236174] n, to assess whether  Arrowg+ard midline 
catheters offer a reduction in the incidence of  symptomatic CR-UEVT.                
  
Specific Aim 2:  To compare  incidence of  catheter-related bloodstream infection 
between the AngioDynamics  BioFlo midline catheter to the Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue 
Advance midline catheter.  
  
For Aim 2, we will identify cases  of infection per  the laboratory confirmed  bloodstream 
infection criteria published by [CONTACT_236175]  (CDC), to assess whether 
Arrowg+ard Blue Advanced  midline catheters offer reduction in catheter-related 
bloodstream infection.  
  
Alternatively, for Aim 1 and Aim 2, to further examine the incidence  of overall  
complications in the light  of the differing catheter dwell  times, catheter days data  
(including multiple  insertions of  midline catheters per  patient in the s tudy period) will 
be analyzed.  
  
Specific Aim 3:  To compare  catheter survival  rate data  between the AngioDynamics   
BioFlo midline catheter and the Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advance midline catheter.  
  
For Aim 3, an improved survival  of Arrowg+ard Blue Advanced  midline catheters will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_236176].  The  event  is failure of  functionality identified during  follow -up assessment 
during  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Duration of  dwell  and functional  failure of  the  catheter will be 
employed to estimate catheter survival.   
  
Study Design   
  
We propose a prospective  single-site, parallel, two-arm,  randomized  investigation  to 
assess catheter-related symptomatic UEVT, catheter-related bloodstream infection, 
and  functionality of  two single lumen midline catheters:  AngioDynamics  BioFlo 4 F 
and Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advance 4.[ADDRESS_285964] of  Beaumont Research Institute. Written informed   
consent  will be obtained  from all participants.  
  
All inpatients 18  years  of age and older  that  require midline catheter placement by  
[CONTACT_236177]. Patients  will be excluded 
if: Do not meet  inclusion  criteria 2. Multiple lumens  required  3. Alternative diameter  of 
catheter used  4. If already  enrolled once prior 5. Withdraw voluntarily from the study 
6. Are  receiving oral, intravenous, or  subcutaneous treatment  dose anticoagulation 
(prophylaxis with  anticoagulant is  permissible).
IRB NUMBER: 2018-379
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 04/30/[ADDRESS_285965] at  a 1:1 ratio in block 
randomization to AngioDynamics  BioFlo or  Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advanced  
midline catheters. Participant  enrollment will take place from November  
2018 until patient recruit ment is  complete. Demographic and health-related  
information will be obtained  from electronic medical records during  enrolled period at  
William Beaumont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
  
  
Practitioner  Participation/Training  
  
Advanced  Practice Providers within the bedside PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]/Midline  service  at the Royal  
Oak  campus  are eligible to place catheters for this study. A cohort of  fifteen providers 
are possible volunteers to be trained to place catheters for this study.  Placing  catheters 
for this study is  not required  and will be carried out on a strictly voluntary basis. All 
advanced practice providers  are credentialed  in placing PI[INVESTIGATOR_236171]. 
None  of the providers  have previous experience with  the Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue 
Advance midline catheter. The  clinical  team from Teleflex will be expected to develop  
an educational/training pathway for providers  to achieve proficienc y prior to subject 
recruitment. A possible training/credentialing pathway  may consist of: [ADDRESS_285966] securement, functionality is  confirmed   
with  blood sampling (10  cc) and  flush without  resistance.   
  
The research  team also will document practitioner details, the vascular  access  device 
(VAD) used, the time  of VAD  placement, number  of attempts, need  for a rescue inserter, 
the vein that  was  cannulated , depth and diameter  of the vein, and the indication for 
VAD  placement.  An attempt is  defined as each time the needle punctures the skin. Data  
will be collected  from the  electronic medical record  and  
includes:  age, gender, BMI, vital  signs, relevant past medical  history.  Specific medical 
history of  interest  includes:  1. VTE 2. Cancer  (within past 6 months) 3. Hypercoaguable 
state  4. Current pregnancy/up  to 8 weeks postpartum 5. Major  surgery/major trauma 
within past 4 weeks 6. Estrogen supplementation 7. Long

Immobilization >72 hours 10. Other. Indication for catheter placement will also be 
recorded:  1. DIVA 2. Antibiotics  3. Incompatible  Medications 4.  Other   
  
 Follow-up Assessment   
  
Investigators will perform a follow-up assessment on all catheters within [ADDRESS_285968]  information of  the Vascular Access Team (standard  practice) 
at the time of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_236172]. If the 
patient develops  any concerning signs  or symptoms for the venous  thromboembolism, 
the Vascular Access Team will instruct the patient to return to  the outpatient clinic for 
an evaluation with  a member of  the Vascular Access Team, schedule  an urgent 
appointment with  the medical  doctor, or  check  into the Emergency  Department for 
further evaluation. The  research  team will document imaging results from these  
encounters. All  patients will receive follow-up phone call assessments by [CONTACT_236178].  Patient  disposition options include: discharge home/residence or  to a skilled  
nursing facility or  transfer  to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the patient is  discharged  home, 
infusion and catheter care occurs via  home  care or  at an infusion center. For patients 
discharged  to a skilled  nursing facility, catheter care and infusion is  managed  by 
[CONTACT_236179]. These patients will continue to be followed in the post-
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], specifically to assess for the complication of  thrombosis. The  research  
staff will follow-up via telephone  call with  staff managing the infusion within [ADDRESS_285969]  day of  therapy to inquire about  the 
VAD  site and function of  the catheter and document any complications/results  to 
radiographic imaging. Once therapy is  completed and the catheter is  removed, the 
research  team will follow  up with  the patient or  designated  legally authorized 
representative/next of  kin via phone to inquire about the access  site at  [ADDRESS_285970] IRB NUMBER: 2018-379
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 04/30/[ADDRESS_285971]. Bahl  and 
Emily  Diloreto for further evaluation per  routine.  
 
 
SVT  and DVT rates will be calculated  based on upper extremity proven diagnosis  of 
SVT  and/or DVT in symptomatic cases. Researchers will review all study subject 
records  in EPIC, the electronic medical  records system,  and screen enrolled subject 
data  for all upper extremity venous  Doppler  examinations.  Radiology interpretations 
will be reviewed for findings consistent  with  CR-UEVT. This review will occur  thirty 
days post patient discharge. Symptoms and rationale  for imaging will be documented. 
This information will be obtained  by [CONTACT_236180]/provider documentation in 
EPIC. If the patient is  diagnosed with  thrombophlebitis, the location of  the thrombus 
will also be documented.

Infection rate  will be tracked using confirmed  catheter-related blood stream infection 
data  from the surveillance team within the epi[INVESTIGATOR_236173]. The  team 
utilizes the CDC  definition of  laboratory-confirmed blood-stream infection (LCBSI). See 
Appendix A for LCBSI definitions and pathway for diagnosis.  
 
The medication administration record  will be queried for all medications  given 
through each catheter. Vesicants  that  are generally given via central line or  considered 
caustic to the vessel will be noted in both  groups. Number of  doses will be recorded. 
See Appendix B for full  list of  non-neoplastic vesicants.  We will al so collect  data  on 
patients that  received  alteplase  for occlusion. We will specifically evaluate the 
relationship  of alteplase  use and how it relates  to catheter-related thrombosis, 
catheter-related bloodstream infection, and functionality of  catheter.   
  
 
Sample Size  and Statistical  Analysis    
 
Sample Size:  For this randomly allocated, two group experiment, the primary outcome 
was  complication profile  in terms  of thrombophlebitis. Under  Aim 1, based on the 
preliminary analysis  using approximately  13 months of  data  at William Beaumont 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], it suggested the incidence  of thrombosis between 12-15%  from  
1,200 insertions of  AngioDynamics  BioFlo midline catheters with  the diagnosis of   
symptomatic thrombosis. We established a one-sided  Fisher ’s exact  two- 
proportions test with  a type I error  α = 0.05. In terms  of results from previous study 
[1], sample  size was  designed to have a power of  80% fo r detecting  a 11% lower in the 
incidence  of thrombosis using  Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advanced  midline catheters. 
Based on these  criteria, 212 participants will be randomly allocated to 2 study groups 
(106 per  group). This sample  size included a 20% buffer  to account  for potential 
sample  loss. For Aim 3, this sample  size has a power of  0.[ADDRESS_285972] with  a 0.05 one-sided  significant  
level and median time of  midline catheter introduction  into a vein of  10 days [1].  All 
above calculations  were made using the power software PASS 16.  
 
Statistical  Analysis: For Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will use descriptive statistics (frequency, 
percent) to summarize the inciden ce of  complication profile  in terms  of thrombosis 
and infection between these  two groups. For Aim 1, a logistic regression model  will be 
built to examine the association between midline catheters and the presence of  
thrombosis, adjusting for participant characteristics. The  odds ra tio  
(OR) associated  midline catheters on thrombosis will be estimated. For Aim 2, we  
will further create cases  of bloodstream infection per  1000 catheter-days,

accounting for catheter dwell  times. A Poisson regression model  will be employed to 
assess the relative risk  (RR) of  AngioDynamics  BioFlo and Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue 
Advanced  midline catheters on the presence of  infection within any observed catheter 
dwell  time, adjusting for participant characteristics. P-values  of less than  
0.[ADDRESS_285973] ratio (HR) of  two midline catheters for function  
failure will be reported.

4  1.0 – OVERVIEW AND  BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 BACKG ROUND  
 
Type  1 diabetes  (T1D) is a disease  characterized  by [CONTACT_179737]  β-cell loss with eventual  dependence  on exogenous 
insulin. The incidence of T1D is rising at a rate of nearly 3% per year, and the disease contributes over $14.4 
billion annually to U.S. healthcare expenditures [1, 2]. While immunomodulatory therapy administered near the 
time of clinical diagnosis  has shown some  efficacy  in attenuating  T1D progression,  the long-term effectiveness  of 
these drugs has been negligible [3 -7]. G iven these failures, there is a critical need for a simple, tolerable, cost - 
effective method to mitigate the disease process and burden associated with daily diabetes  management.  
 
Compared  to healthy  individuals,  people  with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes  demonstrate  gut dysbiosis  (microbial 
imbalance) with a higher gram- negative to gram -positive gut bacterial ratio (creating a pro -inflammatory milieu) 
and fewer  bifidobacteria,  an important microbial  population associated  with many  health  benefits  [8-13]. Further, 
the gut microbiome composition of T1D children shows increased virulence factors, phage, prophage, motility 
genes and higher response to stress [14 -18], in addition to a lower count of bacteria producing butyrate, a short 
chain fatty acid (SCFA) with anti -inflammatory actions  [19]. 
 
The effect of gut microbiome modulation on glycemia has been assessed using both prebiotics (supplements containing substrates for the microbiota) and probiotics (supplements containing microbiota). Animal studies 
have shown that pre and probiotic  use can change  the gut microbiome  profile,  modulate  the immune  system,  and 
improve glucose tolerance [20 -22]. In persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prebiotics improve hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c) and postprandial glycemic excursion as well as reduce insulin resistance [23 -26]. Thus, it appears that 
altering the gut microbiome may improve glycemia and improve insulin sensitivity.  
 
A novel approach to mitigating T1D is perturbation of the gut microbiome using high -amylose maize starch 
(HAMS),  a well-tolerated  source  of dietary  fiber with selective  fermentation  properties.  HAMS  consumption shifts 
the gut microbiome  profile  towards  SCFA  fermenters.  Further,  HAMS  that is acetylated  and butyrylated  (HAMS - 
AB) releases large amounts of beneficial SCFAs after colonic bacterial fermentation. Indeed, recent T1D mouse studies  [22] have shown  that HAMS -AB feeding  shifted  the gut microbiome  profile  towards  fermenters,  resulting 
in higher blood and fecal concentrations of the microbial metabolites acetate and butyrate (both beneficial SCFAs). 
These changes were associated with lower rates of progression to T1D, lower circulating inflammatory marker  
concentrations,  and less islet autoimmunity.  Data to date using  HAMS  in humans  are more  limited.  When given  to 
non-diabetic  adults,  HAMS  lowers  post-prandial  glucose  production  and improves  insulin  sensitivity  [27, 28].  
 
1.2 Overview  
Given these promising findings in animal models of T1D as well as adult non -diabetic studies, we hypothesize 
that HAMS -AB will alter the gut microbiome profile in humans with T1D and increase SCFA production and 
that these changes will be associated with improved β -cell function, overall glycemia, and β -cell health (as measure d 
by [CONTACT_179738] β -cell stress and death). We plan to perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], randomized, controlled cross -over trial of 
HAMS -AB in 12 individuals with recently diagnosed T1D to determine HAMS -AB effects on the gut microbiome 
profile, SCFA production, glycemia, ma rkers of β -cell function, stress , and death.  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] a single center trial. Twelve newly diagnosed T1D youths with a BMI<85% and within [ADDRESS_211500] chosen this cohort since the microbiome 
profile differs by [CONTACT_654] [29] and BMI [30], and the progression of T1D differs between children and adults [31]. Additionally,  there is ample published  experience  studying  healthy  adolescents  and their microbiome changes with 
corn fiber supplementation [32, 33], and therefore, we have chosen to pi[INVESTIGATOR_179723] a similar age group 
with known published data. In addition, to assess changes more accurately in β -cell function, we will include those 
in the honeymoon period as there is sufficient measurable C - peptide secretion during this time. The honeymoon 
period is the time shortly after T1D diagnosis when the β -cells undergo partial and tem porary recovery and 
produce enough insulin to reduce insulin needs and aid with glycemic control [34,  35]. 
 
 
IRB# [PHONE_3856]   Version 1 2.0 - April 2023  
 
 
5  The objectives  of this study  are to assess the HAMS -AB effects  on the gut microbiome  profile,  SCFA  production, 
glycemia and β -cell health and function in humans with T1D. We hypothesize that HAMS -AB will (i) improve 
the gut microbiome  profile  in humans  with T1D,  (ii) increase  SCFA  production,  and (iii) improve  β-cell function, 
β-cell health and overall glycemia. We propose the following Specific  Aims:  
 
AIM 1: Determine the effect of HAMS -AB on the gut microbiome profile and SCFA production in 
children with recently  diagnosed T1D. We hypothesize that HAMS -AB consumption will shift the gut 
microbiome  to microbial  populations  that are capable of HAMS -AB fermentation and increase  SCFA  production. 
Twelve youths ( 11-17 years old) will consume HAMS -AB or follow the standard of care recommended diabetic 
diet daily for [49,50] 4 weeks and then cross over after a  4-week washout period. DNA will be extracted from 
fecal samples  obtained  followed  by 16S RNA  sequencing  for gut microbial  community  analysis  at baseline  and at 
each visit during  the study  period  [32, 33]. SCFAs  will be analyzed  using  standard  methods  [36, 37].  
AIM  2: Determine  the effect  of HAMS -AB on glycemia and  β-cell function and  health.  We hypothesize  that 
the prebiotic HAMS -AB will improve overall glycemia including reducing glycemic variability in recently 
diagnosed  persons  with  T1D.  We will compare  glycemic/  β-cell measures  pre/post intervention  with  HAMS -AB 
and between the intervention and control groups. We will measure glycemia using HbA1c, average glucose and 
glucose  variability  using  continuous  glucose  monitoring  (CGM)  [38-40]. We expect  to see an improvement in  
glycemia  in response  to HAMS -AB intake.  We will assess  β-cell function  using  mixed  meal tolerance  (MMTT) - 
derived C -peptide measures. We expect that measures of β -cell stress/death will show improvement following  the 
use of HAMS -AB. We will determine β -cell stress using proinsulin/C -peptide (PI:C) ratios [41]. We will assess β -
cell death by [CONTACT_179739] (INS) DNA  [42]. 
 
Upon successful completion of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we expect to assess the effect of prebiotic administration on the 
gut microbiome profile, SCFA production, glycemia and β -cell function in humans with T1D. The knowledge 
generated by [CONTACT_179740] a fully powered study.  
 
1.3 PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
 
HAMS  is a prebiotic  that is a well-tolerated  source  of dietary  fiber with selective  fermentation properties.  In T1D 
mouse  studies  [21], feeding  HAMS  that has been acetylated  and butyrylated  (HAMSA  and HAMSB)  shifts  the gut 
microbiome  profile  towards  fermenters,  resulting  in increased  acetate and  butyrate  production  and lower  rates of 
progression to T1D, Figure  1. 
 
In a human study assessing the effects of 2 levels of intake of HAMS [15 or 30 g/d (double -blind)] compared to 
control starch intake (0 HAMS) for 4 -wk periods separated by 3 -wk washouts on insulin sensitivity (SI) in 
participants with increased waist circumference, it appeared that the consumption of 15 –30 g/d of HAMS 
improved ins ulin sensitivity significantly in men, Figure 2 [27].  
 
In another human randomized, double -blind, controlled study [28] in healthy adults who consumed either a high 
fiber scone  containing  a novel  chemically  modified  high amylose  maize starch  or a low fiber control  scone  without 
the maize starch, the consumption of the high fiber scone significantly reduced postprandial glucose and insulin incremental  areas  under  the curves  (43–45%  reduction,  35–40%  reduction,  respectively)  and postprandial  glucose 
and insulin maximum concentrations (8 –10% and 22% reduction, respectively), Figure 3. Of note, ingestion of 
the high fiber scone consumption was not associated with increased gastrointestinal side effects compared with 
the control  scone.

8  3.2 STUDY  DURATION  
 
This study will screen up to 24 subjects at a single center (see Enrollment below). [ADDRESS_211505] meets all eligibility criteria again . Participants may re -
enter or re-enroll in the study if in  the future,  meet  all eligibility requirements. Participants who  re-enter or  re-
enroll will need to be reassessed for their starting point.  Subjects who miss 20% of prebiotic doses (11 of 56 
doses) will be replaced.  The study will include the following periods:  
 
• (1) Screening visit and eligibility determination (up to 30  days).  
• (2) 4-week intervention period or diet guideline  
• (3) 4-week  washout period  
• (4) 4-week intervention period or diet guideline.  
 
3.3 ENROLLMENT  
 
Up to 24 subjects will be screened to find 12 adequate subjects eligible for enrollment.  
 
The plan is to recruit 24 patients with the goal of having 50% eligible and enrolled. Once [ADDRESS_211506] 
completed the 12 week visit , we will stop recruitment. At Indiana University, as per our current recruitment 
strategies for other new -onset studies, patients with newly diagnosed T1D will be approached whenever possible  
when  inpatient at diagnosis  and then re-contact[CONTACT_179741].  Visits  will be conducted  at the Indiana 
Clinical Research Center (ICRC ) and coordinated with diabetes clinic follow -up visits when  possible.  
 
3.4 STUDY  ENDPOINTS  
 
The primary  outcome  assessment  will be to assess  changes  in the gut microbiome  profile  in response  to HAMS - 
AB. Secondary  outcome  measures  will be changes  in SCFA  production,  changes  in glycemia,  pro-insulin  to C- 
peptide  ratios  as a marker  of β cell ER stress.  Other  β cell stress  markers  including  unmethlyated  insulin  DNA will  
also be measured.  We will also examine  glycemic  outcomes  and β cell function  as assessed  by [CONTACT_179742], 
although given the variability in these measures in other reported studies of new -onset T1D [43] we do not expect 
to be adequately powered in thi s small trial to see significant differences in these  outcomes.  
 
3.5 STUDY  RISKS  
 
Risks  include  those  risks related  to taking  HAMS -AB, having  blood  draws,  mixed  meal tolerance  tests (MMTT), risk 
of CGM use, and the possible loss of  confidentiality.  
 
Risks of Taking HAMS -AB: 
Given  that most  youths  in the United  States  are consuming  less than the recommended  dietary intake  of fiber, we  
anticipate the following  risks:  
• Likely (reported in >20% of patients): initial abdominal discomfort, increase in frequency of bowel 
movements, although not to the extent of causing diarrhea. These mild intestinal symptoms will likely last 
for only the first few days and are self -limited without  intervention.  
 
Risk of Blood Draws:  
The insertion  of a needle  can cause some  local  pain and can result  in bruising.  Blood  draws  can in rare instances 
cause lightheadedness or fainting. There is also a risk of infection. To mitigate these risks, blood draws will be 
performed by [CONTACT_179743] s or nurses using standard aseptic  techniques.  
 
Risk of MMTT:  
There are no known risks to an MMTT, but the taste of the Boost may not be well tolerated. Some persons may 
experience nausea after drinking Boost. Subjects with milk or soy allergies will be ex cluded to avoid any allergic  
 
 
IRB# [PHONE_3856]   Version [ADDRESS_211507], subjects  will be  instructed  to give an insulin 
correction  dose.  
 
Risks related to CGM use:  
The CGM/sensor may produce pain when it is inserted into the skin. There is a low risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin  
infection  at the site of the sensor  needle  placement.  Itchiness,  redness,  bleeding,  and bruising  at the insertion site may 
occur as well as local tape  allergies.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality:  
There is the unlikely chance that health information is viewed by [CONTACT_179744].  All files will be kept in locked  cabinets  within  a locked  room.  Any 
electronic data wil l be protected by [CONTACT_179745].  
 
3.[ADDRESS_211508] a role in the 
complications of the disease, these studies are of scientific importance. The benefits to be derived by [CONTACT_179746], prevention,  and treatment of type 1 
diabetes.  If this study  indicates  that treatment can safely preserve  beta cell health,  then it will be a major  advance 
in the care of  diabetes.  
 
3.7 INCLUSION OF  CHILDREN  
 
Type 1 diabetes is a disease that typi[INVESTIGATOR_179724], adolescents, and yo ung adults. Because we 
are interested in examining the role of the HAMS -AB and the gut microbiome in adolescents with T1D (and 
potentially eventually those at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] T1D), adolescents will be studied to have data in a relevant 
population. As part of the consent process, in addition to consent from the parent, assent for studies and 
samples from all participants will be obtained.

4.4 CLINICAL STUDIES – MECHANISM  OF ACTION  
 
HAMS appears to work by [CONTACT_179747] [26, 27]. Additionally, the FDA has concluded that there was scientific evidence for a qualified 
health claim that HAMS reduced risk of type 2 diabetes development in adults.  
 
 
4.5 STUDY RELATED  INFORMATION  
 
HAMS -AB will be in the form  of acetylated  and butyrylated  HYLON® VII corn starch  [a resistant  corn 
starch type 2 (RS2) derived from high amylose maize starch and containing approximately 70% amylose 
that has been acetylated  and butyrylated.  It will be provided  by [CONTACT_179748],  Bridgewater,  NJ. A 
computer -based  randomization plan will be prepared by [CONTACT_978]. Randomization lists will be kept by [CONTACT_32816]. 
 
HAMS is a resistant corn starch type 2 dietary supplement which is high in certain foods such as potatoes and green unripe bananas. RS2 is not digested in the small intestine and acts as a dietary fiber. Many short 
chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acet ic, propi[INVESTIGATOR_58585], and butyric acid, are formed normally during bacterial 
fermentation in the gut after fiber intake. Therefore, there are no expected adverse effects in general. Similarly, we do not expect any adverse effects during pregnancy. However , to be safe, female subjects who are pregnant 
or anticipating pregnancy will not be enrolled and pregnancy tests will be done for females of reproductive 
potential at all visits.  
 
HAMS has a satisfactory safety profile based on exposure in adults and pediatrics g iven that it is a dietary 
supplement available over the counter. To date, there has been no indication of specific organ class toxicity. Additionally, there has been no indication of a particular pattern of event clustering or increased individual safety r isk, and no increased vulnerabilities or major risks have been identified for the T1D and pediatric 
population.

 Data Collection:  
*Historical data: Date of birth, sex, Race/Ethnicity, date of diagnosis of T1D.  
**To be done in girls of reproductive potential.  
***Current  Medical  Data  (All visits  except  screening):  Medication  use including  types  of insulin,  means  of insulin  administration,  and total daily insulin  dose 
(u/kg  body  weight,  averaged  over the 3 days prior  to each study  visit),  use of other  medications.  
****Stool samples will be collected at home using a kit (Zymo feces catcher and RNA/DNA shield fecal collection tubes) within 3 days of presentation to each 
visit. 
*****Participants  will be assessed  for safety  with questions  regarding  general  well-being  as well as specific  questions  to evaluate  for adverse events.  Participants  will 
also be questioned about stool form and frequency, gastroi ntestinal symptoms, fevers , or infection.  
*******Dietary Assessments will be ideally obtained using the Automated Self -Administered 24 -Hour (ASA24) dietary assessment tool [46 -48], a web -based tool 
for administering automatically coded, self -administered recalls/food records. This will allow assessment of dietary fiber intake along with ot her dietary components. 
Participants will be asked to fill these in for the 24 hrs . diet recall prior to each stool collection  in a time frame of +/ - [ADDRESS_211513] all meals and snacks, 
time of day, number of servings, major food components or description (for example chicken or protein), estimated portion siz es and whether they  completed the 
meal or not,  and any drinks including water.  
†Pancreatic autoantibodies to be tested only in those with no evidence of being tested for antibodies in their medical chart to confirm T1D.  
††Random,  non-fasting  c-peptide:  C-peptide  level will be analyzed  at Indiana University Translation Core Lab  using  a two site immuno -enzymometeric  assay  using  
a Tosoh  2000 auto- analyzer (TOSOH,  Biosciences,  Inc., South  San Francisco,  CA). The C-peptide  assay is calibrated  against  the WHO  IS 84/[ADDRESS_211514]  and 
has a sensitivity  level of 
0.05 ng/mL.  
†††At visit 2 (baseline/intervention)  and 4 (crossover) , a blinded  CGM  sensor  will be inserted  in those participants who are not currently using a CGM as part 
of their routine care . Training  will be provided  on calibration of the sensor, its use in blinded mode, and sensor insertion. Participants will be reminded to insert 
a sensor at home after approximately 14 days and continue using the blinded sensor for an additional 14 days. Participants wi ll use their own home blood 
glucose meter or (if had been previously using one) CGM for regular  blood  glucose  monitoring.  The participant will return  after [ADDRESS_211515] 200 hours  (equivalent to 8.3 days out of 14  days)  
††††C -peptide by 2 -h MMTT: 2 -hour MMTT will be performed using the standardized protocol utilized by [CONTACT_179750] [51]. The early 
discontinuation MMTT will only be done if it has been at least [ADDRESS_211516] MMTT.  
^Serum and Plasma for storage –  subject has option to consent or deny storage. Will be used for future type 1 diabetes research assays.

Participants will be requested to record the amount of insulin they have used during the [ADDRESS_211522]’s responsibility. Also, it is the subject’s responsibility to determine the extent of health care coverage. There  is no program in place for other  monetary  compensation for such injuries.  However,  the subject  will not 
give up any legal rights or benefits to which he/she is otherwise entitled. If any severe adverse events occur while not at a medical facility, the subject will be responsible for seeking medical care and for the exp enses 
associated with any care  received.

7.3 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
An adverse event is defined as any unintended or abnormal clinical observation that is not of benefit to the 
patient. Either the condition was not present prior to exposure to study supplement, or it has worsened in 
intensity or frequency following exposur e to the study supplement. Adverse events will be graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria v5.0. 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_  
5x7.pdf  
Any suspected or confirmed toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the principal 
investigator.  
 
Hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events that are seen as part of daily diabetes managemen t will not be 
considered adverse events unless they result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179730] (PI) will report to the IRB as soon as possible, but in all cases within [ADDRESS_211524] of Events that Require Prompt Reporting to the IUPUI IRB: Any of the following:  
• Event (including adverse events, injuries, side effects during the research study), which in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_179731] 
• caused harm to one or more subjects or others, or placed one or more  subjects 
or others at increased risk of harm;  AND  
• was unexpected;  AND  
• was related to the research  procedures  
 
Note: After the study is closed with the IRB, these events will only be repor ted if they are profound , or they 
demonstrate long -term risks that would necessitate notifying subjects.  
• Protocol deviation/violation (as defined under this  policy)  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research subject (e.g ., purposeful and for subject safety)  
• Complaint of a subject that indicates unexpected risks, or complaint that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_179756] 
• Interim  findings  and safety  monitoring  reports  that indicate  an unexpected  change  to the risks or 
potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or  frequency  
• Publication  in the literature  that indicates  an unexpected  change  to the risks or potential  benefits  of 
the research  
• Change  in FDA  labeling  or withdrawal  from  marketing  of the supplement used in this research 
study  
• Noncompliance (as defined in this  policy)

 8.0    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A sample size of 12 with a cross over design (i.e ., 12 per arm) is considered adequate to e stimate effect sizes for 
efficacy to aid in designing future trials for responses that are normally distributed [52]. Simple comparisons will 
be performed using chi -square for categorical variables and t -tests for continuous variables. Random attritions 
and failed  screens  will be replaced.  An intention  to treat analysis  will not be appropriate  given  the crossover  design. 
Adverse events will be presented as the proportion of each event seen. This is considered a minimal risk study 
with low risk for minor adverse events such as mild gastrointestinal symptoms that could be related to increased 
dietary fiber intake. Our primary outcome is changes in the gut microbiome profile. To determine the diversity 
and richness of the microbiome, we will calculate a diversity index for both the pre - and post -intervention time 
points  for each recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Microbial sequence  analysis  and statistics  will be analyzed  using  the Quantitative  Insights 
into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 1.8.0 software as previously described  [53]. 
 
8.0    PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES  
 
Data sources will include paper and electronic medical records and test results. Data will be recorded on paper, 
desktop computers, and laptop computers. The Principal Investigator, Research Coordinators, Co-  
Investigators, Biostatistics, and Governmental Agencies will have access to the individually identifiable data. This da ta will be safeguarded by [CONTACT_179757], keepi[INVESTIGATOR_179732], password protecting computers and files, and regular back -ups of electronic data. Data 
will be retained indefinitely. When confide ntial data need to be discarded, paper records will be shredded, 
CD’s and diskettes will be destroyed, and data will be permanently deleted from computers. When possible, only de -identified data will be shared. If identifiable data will be shared, it will be done by [CONTACT_179758] a secured 
area, on a shared drive with password protection, or by [CONTACT_179759].

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
 
Title:  SHARE : Sharing Healthcare Wishes in Primary Care  
Grant Number:  R01AG058671  
Study Description:  This study will test a multicomponent communication intervention , 
referred to as SHARE, to proactively engage family members or friends 
(interchangeably referred to as “family” and/or “caregiver”) and 
support advance care planning in primary care.  We will conduct a two -
group randomized trial at up to 10 primary care practices in which 124 
dyads  (+/- 10) will receive a control protocol of minimally enhanced 
usual care and 124 dyads  (+/- 10) will receive the SHARE protocol.  We 
test the efficacy of SHARE on quality of communication (primary 
outcome) and advance care plan ning processes (secondary outcomes) 
at 6 months among primary care patients with cognitive impairment 
(mild -severe) and family caregiver dyads. For patients who die by 24 
months, we examine the quality of end of life care and bereaved family 
caregiver expe riences with medical decision -making (secondary 
outcomes).   
Objectives:  
 To test the efficacy of SHARE on improved quality of communication 
(primary outcome) and end -of-life experiences (secondary outcomes) of 
primary care patients with cognitive impairment (mild -severe) and 
family caregivers . 
Endpoint s: Primary Endpoint:  Quality of Communication and Quality of End of Life 
Care  
Secondary Endpoints:  Advance care planning processes and bereaved 
family caregiver experiences with medical decision -making  
Study Population:  We plan to enroll a sample of 248  (+/- 20) person -family dyads 
comprising  primary care patients with cognitive impairment ages [ADDRESS_274855] with medical 
decision making, who we refer to as their caregiver.  This study focuses 
on persons ages 80 and older with cognitive impairment (mild -severe) .  
Stage:  Stage 1 Behavioral Intervention   
Description of Sites:  We will conduct the trial at up to 10 primary care practices within two 
health systems (Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, and MedStar 
Health System) in the Baltimore /Washington area.   
Description of Study 
Intervention /Experimental 
Manipulation : SHARE encompasses the following four therapeutic elements: 1) a letter 
from the practice introducing the initiative, 2) access to a designated 
person (medical assistant, social worker, nurse, or lay person) trained to 
lead advance care planning discussions , 3) person -family agenda -setting 
to align perspectives about the role of the caregiver and stimulate 
discussion about goals of care, and 4) education about communication 
and available resources .   
Study Duration:  The project period extends over four years . 
Participant Duration:  Participants in both groups will be followed over a 24 -month period.

 5 advance care planning early in the disease trajectory,6,7 the under -diagnosis of ADRD8-10 and because of 
the greater implementation potential of a protocol with broader applicability.  We hypothesize that as 
compared with the minimally enhanced control care group, caregivers in the intervention group will 
report better quality of communication about end of life care with primary care clinicians at 6 months 
(primary outcome) .  We further examine the effects of the intervention on  advance care planning 
processes (secondary outcomes) at 6 months .  For patients who die by 24 months, we examine the quality 
of end of life care and bereaved family caregiver experiences with medical decision -making (secondary 
outcomes).   
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are among the most profoundly disabling and costly 
of all health conditions11 and the 5th leading cause of death.[ADDRESS_274858] are less 
likely to complete an advance directive or formally designate a surrogate decision -maker,20 placing them 
at heightened risk for unnecessary suffering and high utilization of burdensome and costly end -of-life 
care.21-23 
 
SHARE involves the following elements: 1) a letter from the practice introducing the initiative, to prepare 
persons and families to discuss goals of care,24 2) access to a designated staff member (e.g., medical 
assistant, social worker or nurse, lay person) trained to lead advance care planning discussions,25-27 3) 
person -family agenda -setting, to align perspectives about the role of family and stimulate discussion 
about goals of care,28 and 4) education about communication and available resources, including a 44 -page 
brochure developed by [CONTACT_228275] “A Guide for Older People: Talking with 
your Doctor”, a blank easy to complete advance directive, and facilita ted registration to the patient portal 
(for patient and family), to extend electronic interactions and information access to family.29,[ADDRESS_274859] quality measurement,32,33 National Alzheimer’s Project Act

2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.[ADDRESS_274861] privacy and/or con fidentiality may be breached. We believe the likelihood of such 
risks is low, that we have considered these risks, and that we have adequate protections in place. Our 
prior work we have found that these experiences are relatively rare.  The main risks of participating in this 
study involve inconvenience, person al time, the potential for becoming upset or fatigued, and potential 
loss of confidentiality.  Participants will be free to terminate their participation at any time and will be 
reminded of this during the consenting process.  
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
It is anticipated that persons with cognitive impairment and family caregivers will experience more benefit 
than risk from participation in this study and that risks associated with participation are reasonable in 
comparison to knowledge that may be gained . Benefits accrued by [CONTACT_228277]’s health and treatment preferences and the communication 
roles to be assumed by [CONTACT_228278] -to-face medical visits, in electronic inte ractions with 
primary care providers, and in future medical decision -making.  In addition to improving advance directive 
completion we hypothesize that the intervention might improve medical visit communication and 
satisfaction with care.  Societal benefit s will result from this study.  We will test a scalable protocol to 
improve the quality of communication about end of life care in primary care, extending knowledge 
regarding the implementation and effects of advance care planning for persons with cognitiv e impairment 
outside of institutional settings.  If this trial has a positive effect on communication, the methodology has 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October [ADDRESS_274862] potential application to improve advance care planning and end of life care in primary care.  
Participants in the minimally enhanced care  group will not directly benefit from participation . 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
This is a Minimal Risk study of a behavioral  intervention.  The trial will be conducted in a population of 
older adults 80 years and older with cognitive impairment . The significance of our study rests in part on 
low completion of advance care planning in the target population despi[INVESTIGATOR_228244] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency department visits).  Advance care planning is 
already  routinely offered in primary care and uptake of intervention processes will be at the discretion 
of patients and families.  Based on  our previous work and studies in this area by [CONTACT_2312], there is a small 
risk that participants will become anxious/agitated due to the prospect or experience of advance care 
planning. Adverse events that result from study participation are expected to be m ild and psychological 
in nature. We will monitor rates of adverse health events by [CONTACT_228279] a part of our analytic 
plan, but these events will not be systematically included in safety reporting as it is improbable that they 
will result from th e intervention.  
Individuals in the intervention and control groups may benefit from participation in this trial through 
improved communication between patients and caregivers, primary care providers, and family members 
regarding healthcare wishes, advance care directives,  and the selection of decision makers for patient 
health. In addition, participants will benefit from the knowledge that participation in this trial may lead 
to improved outcomes for others in the future due to  data gathered in this study.  Potential socie tal 
benefits of this trial include a greater understanding of communication processes vital to advance care 
planning and a potential decrease in complicated or burdensome end -of-life care for older adults.  
Several mechanisms to reduce the potential for psychological discomfort will be utilized. Interventionists 
and study interview staff will receive training in techniques for approaching older persons with cognitive 
impairment and family members, including s ensitivity to discussing topi[INVESTIGATOR_228245]. Intervention guides to help 
maintain these skills will be available as well as regular contacts, monitoring and feedback with the  
training team.  
• This is a study about communication and ACP in primary care among older adults with cognitive 
impairment including ADRD. ADRD is a sensitive topic. Older adult participants will have a range of 
ADRD (from mild to severe) and not all older adults will be aw are that they have ADRD or be in 
treatment for memory loss. Therefore, mention of cognitive impairment or ADRD in the recruitment 
materials or in the study title will be avoided.  
• It will be emphasized in training interventionists that advance care planning is voluntary for patients, 
and that advance care planning sessions should not be initiated or be terminated if patients are not 
interested or do not wish to continue at that sess ion.   
• While it is possible that agenda -setting or advance care planning may introduce tension in the 
patient -caregiver relationship by [CONTACT_228280], study 
staff will seek to mitigate associated risks by [CONTACT_228281].  
• Caregivers of older persons with significant health conditions, including those with Alzheimer’s 
Disease and Related Dementias, are at heightened risk of depression and anxiety. During regular 
assessment for this study, participants will be screened for de pressive symptoms or anxiety. Patients 
will be notified of scores above a pre -determined threshold and will be asked if they would like an 
educational brochure about depression or anxiety (as appropriate), or if they would like the 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October [ADDRESS_274863] to notify the family’s primary care clinician of this finding. Caregivers will also be 
encouraged to follow -up to discuss this with their health care clinician.    
• In the event of extreme psychological discomfort among intervention patients or caregivers, 
interviewers and interventionists will be trained in procedures for ensuring necessary medical or 
professional intervention. Referral resource(s) will be identified for distressed family members 
within each health system.  Primary care patients  will be referred to their primary care clinician. 
Caregivers will be referred to the health system referral resource or to medical or psychological care 
(e.g., counseling, support, advocacy) as appropriate .

that intervention caregivers will be more highly engaged in advance care planning than control caregivers as 
measured by [CONTACT_84452] -reported readiness to e ngage in advance care planning and having documented 
advance directive in the patient’s electronic health record at [ADDRESS_274866] that decedents in the intervention group will be less likely to

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
This is a two -group single -blind randomized  Phase 2 efficacy  trial that will be conducted at up to 9  primary 
care practices in which 124  (+/- 10) dyads will receive a control protocol of minimally enhanced usual care 
and 124 (+/- 10) dyads will receive usual care augmented with the SHARE protocol.  We test the efficacy 
of multicomponent communication intervention, referred to as SHARE, on quality of communication 
(primary outcome) and advance care planning processes (secondary outcome s) at 6 -, 12-, and 24 -months

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 9 among primary care patients with cognitive impairment (mild -severe) and family caregiver dyads. For 
patients who die by 24 months, we examine the quality of end of life care (primary outcome) and bereaved 
family caregiver experiences with medical decision -making (secondary outcomes).  Following enrollment 
and follow -up procedures, a small number of intervention group dyads will be selected to participate in a 
focus group interview to assess opi[INVESTIGATOR_228246]. Primary care pati ents 
and family caregiver dyads will consent to being contact[CONTACT_228282].  
 
SHARE encompasses usual care, supplemented with the following four therapeutic elements: 1) a letter 
from the practice introducing the initiative, 2) access to a designated staff member (e.g., medical assistant, 
social worker or nurse, community health wor ker, or lay facilitator) trained to lead advance care planning 
discussions, 3) person -family agenda -setting to align perspectives about the role of the caregiver and 
stimulate discussion about goals of care, and 4) education about communication and availab le resources, 
including a 44 -page brochure developed by [CONTACT_228275] “A Guide for Older 
People: Talking with your Doctor”, a blank easy to complete advance directive, and facilitated registration 
to the patient portal (for patie nt and caregiver) to extend electronic interactions and information access 
to family.  The control group will receive minimally enhanced usual care with print educational materials 
that include the 44 -page brochure developed by [CONTACT_228283] “A Guide for 
Older People: Talking with your Doctor” and a blank easy to complete advance directive.   
 
Person -family dyads assigned to the control group will receive a protocol of minimally enhanced usual 
care, encompassing a print educational brochure and blank easy to complete advance directive. The 
educational materials include a 44 -page brochure developed by [CONTACT_228275] 
“A Guide for Older People: Tal king with your Doctor” and an easy -to-read advance directive.  Control 
dyads will be told that they are participating in a study about communication in primary care. We chose 
an active control arm for several reasons: 1.) because providing an advance direc tive should be the 
standard of care even if it is often not ‘usual care’, 2.) to ensure that positive results can be attributed to 
the effectiveness of the intervention, and 3.) to mitigate perceptions among dyads randomized to the 
control group that they are not being offered anything beyond usual care.  
 
Participants will be randomized to treatment group at the level of the person -family dyad, following block 
randomization within primary care clinician. Participants in both groups will be followed over a 24 -month 
period.  Outcomes will be assessed from remote or in-person  patient and caregiver interviews at 
enrollment and follow -up telephone or web surveys at 6, 12, and 24 months ,; electronic health record  
portal activity; information about advance directive completion from electronic medical record; 
burden some care at the end of life from family telephone or web survey and CRISP.    
 
The below exhibit  depi[INVESTIGATOR_228247].  The main pathway s of interest (highlighted in 
red font) depi[INVESTIGATOR_228248] -of-life care.  These processes 
are relational in nature and we therefore assess constructs relat ed to person -family mutuality, the 
patient -clinician therapeutic alliance, and shared decision -making at baseline and at all time points  
although t hese constructs are expected to be less responsive to change and less centrally aligned with the 
intervention pathway.  We recognize feedback loops between primary care interactions, advance care 
planning, and patient and family experiences.  These communi cation processes are hypothesized to affect

Recognizing that communication is affected by a wide range of individual and interpersonal

 10 over time.  Less mutable characteristics related to sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, 
race/ethnicity, type of relationship, family function) are assessed at baseline only whereas more mutable 
factors relating to health status, quality of li fe, caregiving responsibilities, and caregiving appraisal are 
assessed at each time point.  Patient  TICS -m (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status)  or AD -8 
(Dementia Screening Interview)  is assessed at baseline only at the time of enrollment , or at 6 month for 
those who were unable to communicate at baseline . Results from patient participant’s completion of the 
TICS -m test of cognitive function at baseline will be shared with primary care clinicians for the purpose of 
providing the clinicians with the opportunity to follow -up as appropriate at their discretion ( A3).

5 STUDY POPULATION  
We enroll a sample of 248  (+/- 20) person -family dyads comprising primary care patients with cognitive 
impairment ages [ADDRESS_274871] with medical decision making, 
who we refer to as their caregiver. This study focuses on persons ages 80 and older with cognitive 
impairment (mild -severe). We focus on this target population because persons living with (versus without) 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias are less likely to participate in advance care planning 
discussions, appoint surrogate decision -makers, or complete living wills,20,21 and are consequently at 
greater risk for receiving unwanted aggressive care at the end -of-life.17,21 We focus on persons with mild, 
moderate, and severe cognitive impairment regardless of clinical diagnosis because of the importance of 
addressing advance care planning early in the disease trajectory,6,7 the under -diagnosis of Alzheimer’s 
Disease and Related Dementias8-[ADDRESS_274872] meet all of the following criteria:

Potential patient participants whose  caregiver meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from 
participation in this study:  
1. Younger than [ADDRESS_274877] answers or inability to respond to a 
validated 6 -item phone screening instrument  
6. Plans to move out of state within the next 12 months  
7. Non -family member who is paid for their services  
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
N/A 
5.[ADDRESS_274878] exclusion criteria will be identified prior to 
consenting procedures during the telephone scree n, however patients may reveal health concerns such 
as life -threatening illness or plans to move within the next 12 months during baseline enrollment 
procedures.  Screen failures will be monitored and reported to the DSMB (see Table 3 of Open Tables).  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
5.5.1  SCREENING EVALUATION  
 
We follow a phased approach to screening dyads for potential eligibility , as graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_228249] .  
 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October [ADDRESS_274879] access to records preparatory to research ( H1). JHSPH staff working under the 
direction of a JHHS credentialed clinician to access the electronic medical record for recruitment 
purposes will complete a workforce member agreement co -signed by [CONTACT_228285]. 
(H2).  
Second , we will invite primary care clinicians with an established patient panel at the participating 
practice(s) to provide informed consent ( A1, A5, A8) and to participate in the trial by [CONTACT_228286]. Clinic staff at participating clinics may  talk to their patients about the 
study, and may refer specific patients to our study, so that research staff may contact [CONTACT_228287].  
Third , we will mail letters ( B1) describing the study to patients ages 80 and older who are under the care 
of a participating primary care provider. The letter will state that patients will receive a call in about 10 
days  to explain the study in greater detail. The mailing will also include a pre -addressed  (to the study 
office or PI’s home address) , pre -stamped postcard that the patient or the patient’s caregiver may

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 15 return if they would like to “opt -out” from learning more about the study , or to indicate that they would 
be interested in learning more about the study at a later date  (B2).  
Fourth , patients who do not “opt out” by [CONTACT_228288].  If patients indicate a date that 
they would like to be called on the postcard, research staff will contact [CONTACT_228289].  
Otherwise, patients will be contact[CONTACT_228290].  Patients that may 
be newly eligible for the study (i.e. those that were not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228250], but fit the rest of 
the criteria) will be recontact[CONTACT_228291]. Patients (or caregivers of patients who are unable to 
communicate) who are contact[CONTACT_228292].  The results of the screening interview will be 
recor ded in a REDCap data base so that the study can monitor reasons for ineligibility and 
nonparticipation of eligible candidates. ( B3). Patients with  at least one incorrect answer on the six -item 
telephone screening tool will be eligible to participate if the y have an eligible caregiver who agrees to 
participate. For patients with two or more incorrect answers or who are not able to respond to a six -
item telephone screening tool, we will determine eligibility by [CONTACT_228293] o rder to identify a legally authorized representative according to Maryland law. We will ask 
the legally authorized representative to consent on behalf of patients who lack the capacity to do so 
(D1) as well as obtain assent (verbal, nonverbal) from the pat ient to participate.  
Fifth , caregivers of eligible patients will be contact[CONTACT_228294]. Caregivers who express interest in participating will be asked screening questions to 
determine eligibility . The results of the screening interview will be recorded in a REDCap database so 
that the study can monitor reasons for ineligibility and nonparticipation of eligible candidates. 
Caregivers with fewer than two incorrect answers on the six -item telephone scr eening tool will be 
eligible to participate if the patient is eligible and agrees to participate. ( C1). 
5.5.2  CONSENTING PROCEDURE  
In order to minimize the need for research -only in -person visits, telemedicine visits may be substituted 
for in person clinical trial visits or portions of clinical trial visits where determined to be appropriate and 
where determined by [CONTACT_228295] t to increase the participants risks. Prior to initiating 
telemedicine for study visits the study team will explain to the participant, what a telemedicine visit 
entails and confirm that the study participant is in agreement and able to proceed with this m ethod. 
Telemedicine acknowledgement will be obtained in accordance with the Guidance for Use of 
Telemedicine in Research. In the event telemedicine is not deemed feasible, the study visit will proceed 
as an in -person visit. Telemedicine visits will be cond ucted using HIPAA compliant method approved by 
[CONTACT_12805].  
Primary Care Clinician Recruitment : Primary care clinicians with an established practice at participating 
primary care clinics who express a willingness to participate will be asked to provide written informed 
consent (A1, A5, A8 ) at the inception of the study prior to recruitment of older adults. Providers can 
either complete a remote e -consent process in REDCap or s tudy staff will meet with providers to receive 
written consent at a location that is most convenient to them.  
ACP Facilitator / Interventionist  Recruitment:  Interventionist  trained to guide ACP conversations will be 
invited to provide written informed consent ( E1, E8). Prior to the initiation of intervention delivery , 
informed  consent will be collected either remotely or in -person.  
ACP Fidelity Rater/ ACP Facilitator for qualitative interviews : We will invite ACP Facilitators  and those 
that have utilized our ACP conversation rating tool, to participate in a qualitative interview to help us 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October 202 3 
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 16 understand their experience with the intervention and tool. We will seek verbal consent from  ACP 
Fidelity Raters/ ACP Facilitators  who will be informed that their participation is confidential and 
completely voluntary.  
Patient and Caregiver : During the telephone screen  (B3, C1), we will seek verbal consent from patients 
and c aregivers  who will be informed that their participation is confidential and completely voluntary. 
The objectives, procedures, and a clear statement explaining risks and benefits of the study will be 
presented during the telephone screen.  Patient -caregiver  dyads who are determined to be eligible and 
who agree to participate will be asked to  provide  informed  oral consent  (B4, C2, D4). All consenting will 
be completed by [CONTACT_228296].  Research staff 
will be required to read the entirety of the oral consent scripts, allowing for any questions, comments, 
or concerns of prospective participants . Research staff  will sign and date the oral consent script for 
study records  within the REDCap study database  to maintain detailed records of who administered  the 
participant oral consent  and when . Once oral consent is obtained, patients and caregivers will be mailed  
(via email or post)  copi[INVESTIGATOR_228251].  
For p otential patient participant s who complete the telephone screening interview and who make just 1 
error on the six -item cognitive screen (indicative of very mild cognitive impairment) study eligibility will 
not be contingent on the availability of a legally authorized representative (LAR).  For all other 
potentially eligible patient participants, if the c aregiver  is not the patient’s LAR, we will seek to establish 
the identity (D1) and obtain the  oral consent of the LAR (D4) prior to study enrollment. If a potential 
participant is suspected of moderate to severe cognitive impairment on the basis of [ADDRESS_274880] a LAR or the LAR is unavailable or does not provide 
informed consent, then the  patient will not be eligible to participate in the study.   
Our approach to defining the patient’s legally authorized representative is guided by [CONTACT_228297].  
A legally authorized representative is an individual or other entity authorized under state law to 
consent on behalf of the research participant.  Maryland law does not specify who may consent 
to research participation on behalf of an incompetent adult; howe ver, Maryland law does 
indicate who may consent to medical care on behalf of an incompetent adult. For the purpose of 
determining who may serve as a legally authorized representative of an incompetent adult, 
investigators will follow the Maryland law appli cable to surrogate decision -making for health 
care. This law specifies that the following categories of persons, in the specified order of priority, 
may make health care decisions for the incompetent adult: (1) a health care agent appointed by 
[CONTACT_228298]; (2) a legal guardian appointed by [CONTACT_228299]; (3) a 
spouse; (4) an adult child; (5) a parent; (6) an adult sibling; or (7) a friend or other relative.   
During the  administration  of the informed oral consent protocol , we will evaluate capacity to give 
consent by [CONTACT_228300]  (B4). We will ask: 1) True or false, the 
main purpose of the study is to test a program called SHARE, to support communication between 
patients, families, and their primary care team , 2.) True or false, risks of the study include you may get 
bored,  3). True or false, a cure to cancer is a benefit of this study, 4.) True or false, m y participation is 
voluntary , and 5.) True or false, I may never contact a member of the study team with questions . If the 
patient provides an inaccurate answer, the study staff member will review that section and then re -ask 
the question. The study staff will then pose the question again to the patient.  If the patient answers 
incorrec tly a second time, then they are considered unable to provide informed consent.  Research staff 
will document whether the person may provide oral consent. Among persons who are determined to

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 17 lack capacity to provide informed  oral consent, we will seek to obtain oral assent from the person and 
oral proxy consent from their c aregiver  (if the legally authorized representative) or their legally 
authorized representative. We will ask the legally authorized representative to consent on behalf of 
patients who lack the capacity to do so ( D1). We will obtain oral consent  from the LAR  prior to  the initial  
enrollment  meeting and send  (via email or post)  a paper  copy  of the patient  and LAR  oral consent script  
(B4, D4) to the legally authorized representative for their records . Patients and caregivers may consent 
to be recontact[CONTACT_228301]. Collaborators at Hopkins, and collaborators at outside institutions 
will be able to contact [CONTACT_228302].  Patient information shared with outside 
collaborators will be dependent on an established Data Use Agreement contracted between Johns 
Hopkins and the partner organization. As contact [CONTACT_228303], all participants who agreed to be contact[CONTACT_228304] ( R1) by [CONTACT_228305].  The 
reconsent process will only allow contact [CONTACT_228306] ( UMD IRB 
2053970 -1). 
5.5.3  ENROLLMENT, BASELINE, AND/OR RANDOMIZATION  
Enrollment officially occurs at the time of providing informed oral consent.  See section 5.5.[ADDRESS_274881] intervention research in primary care has relied on cluster -randomization at the level of the clinic, 
which leads to challenges in the interpretation of results due to practice -level imbalances and 
unmeasured contextual differences.60 This study randomizes at the level of person -family dyad, which 
may lead to between -group spi[INVESTIGATOR_228252]. However, as  31 (+/- 
5) intervention dyads will be enrolled at each clinic (~ 4/month), we do not expect widespread changes 
to standard clinic workflows or practices.  We believe the possibility of contamination is low as the 
intervention consists primarily of one -on-one contact [CONTACT_228307] -family 
dyad, and there are no elements of the  intervention that attempt to address clinicians’ communication 
skill.  Nevertheless, our analysis plan permits us to assess for the occurrence of contamination by 
[CONTACT_228308],  such as 
registration for shared access to the patient portal and advance directive completion.  Dyad -level 
randomization will afford a more nuanced understanding of context and allow examination of group 
differences by [CONTACT_228309].  
Each person -family dyad will be randomized to treatment or control group in a 1:[ADDRESS_274882] statistician that 
is unknown to study staff. The randomization module will generate random treatment group assignment 
of study participants for each participating clinician. Once  patient and caregiver  informed oral consent 
(B4, C2) have been received  by [CONTACT_464] , research staff will initiate the randomization procedure 
within REDCap. Person -family dyads assigned to the treatment group will receive information about 
SHARE.  Person -family dyads assigned to the control group will receive print materials about the control 
protocol  (See 6.1.1 ).  
Research staff responsible for the randomization protocol a fter the enrollment visit will be aware of 
participant assignment status after it occurs.  Allocation concealment will be ensured by [CONTACT_228310] 
[INVESTIGATOR_228253] -up assessments and those responsible for coding study outcomes 
throughout the study.  Only the study statistician, selected unblinded staff (and REDCap administrator), 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October [ADDRESS_274883] (DSMB) will have access to unblinded data before 
study completion. As randomization occurs at the level of the person -family dyad, clinicians will care for 
patients in both groups.  Clinicians will be bli nded to group assignment.

6.1.[ADDRESS_274884] primary care at participating practices.  Usual care involves following patients at 
variable intervals, with routine visits scheduled at 2  weeks -6 months, depending on the stability of health 
status.  All patients may register for the patient portal, provide their primary care clinician / clinic with a 
completed advance directive to be uploaded in their electronic health record, or avail the mselves of 
advance care planning with their primary care clinician or other clinic staff.  However, these processes 
generally occur on an ad -hoc basis and do not involve a protocolized approach to engaging with family 
caregivers or advance care planning.  
Person -family dyads assigned to the control  group will receive a protocol of minimally enhanced usual 
care, encompassing  an introductory letter ( F1B), a print educational brochure (F6) and blank easy to 
complete advance directive  (F4, F5). The educational materials include a 44 -page brochure developed by 
[CONTACT_228275] “A Guide for Older People: Talking with your Doctor” (F6) 61 and an 
easy -to-read advance directive  (F4, F5 ).  Control dyads will be told that they are participating in a study 
about communication in primary care. We chose an active control arm for several reasons: 1.) because 
providing an advance directive should be the standard of care even if it is often not ‘usual care’, 2.) to 
ensure that positive results can be attributed to the effectiveness of the intervention, and 3.) to mitigate 
perceptions among dyads randomized to the control group that they are not being  offered anything 
beyond usual care.    
Person -family dyads assigned to the intervention protocol will receive usual care in addition to  SHARE , 
encompassing the following four components (see exhibit below ). 
1. An invitation from the primary care clinic introducing the intervention to prepare patients and families 
to engage in advance care planning discussions  (F1A, F7),24  
2. Access to a n ACP facilitator / interventionist  trained in the protocol and leading advance care planning 
for persons with cognitive impairment and their families,26,27  
3. Person -family agenda -setting to align perspectives about the role of family and stimulate discussion 
about health care issues and advance care planning  (F2),28 and 
4. Education about communication and available resources, including a 44 -page brochure developed by

6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
Staff at participating primary care clinics will be informed about the study objectives and how to respond 
to patient/family queries that may arise related to intervention processes such as how to facilitate 
registration to the patient portal for families,  and where and how to upload a completed advance 
directive.  Investigators will identify a liaison from each of the two partnering health systems to assist with 
the implementation of the intervention at participating clinics.  Clinic staff at participating  primary care 
clinics will be introduced to the study at monthly staff meetings.      
 
Intervention and control dyads will be introduced to their respective protocol remotely (see section 5.5.2 
for more information about telemedicine for remote processes)  after randomization a nd completing the  
baseline enrollment  survey . Study participants in both groups will be told they are participating in a study 
about communication in primary care and will be followed for up to 24 months.  Research staff will provide 
person -family dyads in both groups with a letter from the primary care practice describing a new 
communication initiative.   
 
Person -family dyads assigned to the control  group will receive a protocol of minimally enhanced usual 
care, encompassing a n introductory letter ( F1B), print educational brochure (F6) and blank easy to 
complete advance directive  (F4, F5). 
 
Person -family dyads assigned to the intervention protocol will receive usual care in addition to SHARE . 
Research staff will provide patients with the contact [CONTACT_228311] (the interventionists)  (E9), and will provide interventionists with  the name , age, caregiving 
relationships, preferred communication modality, travel information/directions and safety concerns for 
potential home visits, and contact [CONTACT_228312].  The SHARE 
advance care planning facilitators will then contact [CONTACT_9702] -family dyads using patient/family preferred 
mode of contact (e.g., by [CONTACT_19381]) within 3 (+/- 3) business days of the enrollment visit to 
request either an  in-person or remote meeting.  Within 5 business days of receiving participant

 20 information, the SHARE ACP facilitators / interventionists  will contact [CONTACT_9702] -family dyads on their 
preferred mode of contact (e.g. by [CONTACT_19381]) to request either a remote or  in-person meeting.  
The meeting will ideally be scheduled within [ADDRESS_274887], uptake, and adoption of SHARE components.  
Two copi[INVESTIGATOR_228254]  (F11)  will be available via a letter delivered by [CONTACT_228313] , and as a reminder of topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722] . From prior 
work 47,[ADDRESS_274888] older adults and families will be receptive to SHARE but that older adults and 
family caregivers will vary in readiness and capacity to engage in elements of advance care planning.  For 
example, prior studies find persons with severe cognit ive impairment ( TICS -m≤27) may have the capacity 
to name a surrogate decision -maker but that completing an instructional directive to specify preferences 
for medical treatments will likely exceed decision -making capacity.75,[ADDRESS_274889] (e.g., to elaborate on meeting 
discussions, communicate emerging concerns, or summarize informal family conversations) to inform and 
stimulate ongoing discussions and documentation.  This feature may  be leveraged in communications with 
the interventionist. At the initial meeting the interventionist will clarify ongoing availability for foll ow-up 
meetings and seek patient and family input regarding the frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly) and mode 
(by [CONTACT_648], via secure electronic messaging through the patient portal) of future “check -in” contacts to 
assess interest in scheduling future meetin gs. Subsequent in -person , telephone, or video conference 
meetings will occur as a result of “check -in” contacts initiated by [CONTACT_139230], ad -hoc requests by 
[CONTACT_228314]/or family caregivers, or notable changes in health (e.g., unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_228255], or notable change in health or function). SHARE interventionists will be 
expected to document the occurrence, content, and outcomes of advance care planning conversations 
after each ACP conversation ( E5).  
 
Participants may  be asked to complete a brief questionnaire following all interventionist/ facilitator 
meetings about their satisfaction with the conversation and their perception of its importance ( E6, E7). 
Participants will be given the survey  via web survey link or as a mailed paper form with  a pre -addressed  
(to the study office or PI’s home address) , stamped envelope return  to the study team  once completed .  
6.[ADDRESS_274890] TRAINING  AND TRACKING  
Our approach to adherence assessment refers to how we monitor and maintain fidelity to the intervention 
protocol. Guided by [CONTACT_210335]77 we address fidelity through a.) design, by 
[CONTACT_228315], b.) training, by [CONTACT_228316] a protocolized 
curriculum to train interventionists in advance care planning and other elements of SHARE, c.) through 
multimodal assessment of the fidelity by [CONTACT_228317], and d.) ongoing 
teleconferences at regular intervals (initially weekly, with less regular intervals over time as the 
interventionists gain competency) to monitor and supp ort interventionists.  All new interventionists will 
be required to present their first three cases during weekly case presentation meetings for discussion.  
The advance care planning facilitator  (interventionist)  will document all patient and family caregiver

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 21 contacts and advance care planning discussions in the patient’s electronic health record and/or a REDCap 
data base  (E5).   
 
Interventionists will be nurse case managers, social workers, office medical assistants, community health 
workers who work [ADDRESS_274891] been in their position for a minimum of one year, 
or trained lay facilitators hired by [CONTACT_137118] m. Training content will include all elements of SHARE, 
including:  The Respecting Choices curriculum, documenting advance directives, facilitating family 
meetings, communicating difficult news, and assessing cognitive capacity. Training will be delivered and 
reinforced using traditional didactics, case scenarios and video conversations, and modeling and 
mentored role play. [CONTACT_228352] will supervise interventionists in weekly  telephone meetings  initially with 
monthly meetings after .  
 
We rely on an established curriculum, Respecting Choices http:// respecting -choices.org, to train 
interventionists  to lead advance care planning conversations.  Respecting Choices includes  patient and 
family education materials, a structured educational curriculum to train non -physicians in the 
competencies of advance care planning and standardization of policies for embedding ACP in routine care 
delivery. 26,[ADDRESS_274892] motivated the adoption of Respecting Choices by [CONTACT_228318].78-81 However, Respecting Choices has not been specifically studied among 
persons with cognitive impairment or combined with strategies to proactively engage family caregivers in 
primary care, as we propose in this study . 
 
Advance care planning facilitators will be either social workers, nurses, or medical assistants that are 
embedded in primary care as part of existing staff - or trained lay facilitators hired by [CONTACT_3476].  
Training will include all components of SHAR E, including: certification in the Respecting Choices ACP 
curriculum, with specific attention to working with patients with cognitive impairment and families; 
documenting and uploading advance directives ; resources specific to cognitive impairment and/or 
dementia. Training will be delivered and reinforced using traditional didactics, case scenarios and video 
conversations, and modeling and mentored role play . 
6.[ADDRESS_274893] intervention research in primary care has relied on cluster -randomization at the level of the clinic, 
which leads to challenges in the interpretation of results due to practice -level imbalances and 
unmeasured contextual differences.60 This study randomizes at the level of person -family dyad, which 
may lead to between -group spi[INVESTIGATOR_228252]. However, as  as many 
as 31 intervention dyads  (+/- 5) will be enrolled at each clinic (~ 4/month), we do not expect widespread 
changes to standard clinic workflows or practices. We believe the possibility of contamination is low as 
the intervention consists primarily of one -on-one contact [CONTACT_228319] -family dyad, and there are no elements of the intervention that attempt to address 
clinicians’ communication skill. Nevertheless, our analysis plan permits us to assess for the occurrence of 
contamination by [CONTACT_228320], such as registration for shared access to the patient portal and advance directive completion.

Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October [ADDRESS_274894] a more nuanced understanding of context and allow examination of 
group differences by [CONTACT_228309].  
 
Each person -family dyad will be randomized to treatment or control group in a 1:[ADDRESS_274895] ical program.  
Upon providing informed oral consent (B4, C2, D4) and after completing the baseline enrollment survey  
(B6, C3), research staff will open the next sequentially ordered envelope specifying treatment group by 
[CONTACT_30223].  Person -family dyads assigned to the treatment group will information about SHARE.  Person -
family dyads assigned to the control group will receive pr int materials about communicating with their 
doctor.  
 
Research staff responsible for the randomization protocol after  enrollment will be aware of participant 
assignment status after it occurs. Allocation concealment will be ensured by [CONTACT_228310] [INVESTIGATOR_228256] -up assessments and those responsible for coding study outcomes throughout the 
study.  Only the study statistician, selected unblinded staff (and REDCap administrator), and members of 
the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will have access to unblinded data before study com pletion. 
As randomization occurs at the level of the person -family dyad, clinicians will care for patients in both 
groups. Clinicians will be blinded to group assignment.  Patient -family dyads will have knowledge of group 
assignment, but no delineation will be made between group assignment  indicating which is treatment or 
control . We will use  grou p naming  conventions of  (Group A and Group B)  to describe group assignment . 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
 
The approach to monitoring ongoing delivery of the intervention protocol will involve recording and 
auditing advance care planning sessions to determine the extent to which the protocol -based objectives 
are achieved. Following Vaccaro and Seaman, 82,83 we will implement a fidelity audit tool to assess the 
extent of adherence of advance care planning conversations to the curriculum, and the competence of its 
deliv ery ( E10).   
 
We will evaluate the extent to which patients and family caregivers avail themselves to therapeutic 
elements of the intervention relating to advance care planning conversations and interactions with 
primary care clinicians and their team about wishes for f uture medical care and goals of care.  A monthly 
report will be generated to track the number, duration, and mode of all contacts with the advance care 
planning facilitator, the content of advance care planning discussions, as well as registration for the 
patient portal by [CONTACT_228321]. The report will produce information by 
[CONTACT_228322]. This level of detail will permit the team to identify areas where full 
implementation is not being achieved and enable correc tive actions. If potentially problematic content 
during meetings is noted, it will be flagged for review during supervision meetings. This information will 
be used to descriptively characterize the intervention group at each data collection time point and as it 
relates to outcomes. In this study we endeavor to complete at least one advance care planning discussion 
for each person -family dyad assigned to the intervention group; ideally within 4 weeks of the enrollment.

PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
This is a Minimal Risk study of a behavioral  intervention.  The trial will be conducted in a population of 
older adults 80 years and older with cognitive impairment and the significance of our study rests in part 
on low completion of advance care planning in the target population despi[INVESTIGATOR_228244] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency department visits).  Advance care planning is 
already routinely offered in primary care and uptake of intervention processes will be at the discretion of 
patients and families.  Parti cipants will be free to terminate their participation at any time and will be 
reminded of this during the consenting process.  Participants in the trial will be offered the intervention 
as a part of routine care and will be free to decline all aspects of i ntervention activities but will continue 
to be assessed according to intention to treat.  
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
 
We will monitor loss to follow up and discontinuation of participation in the study.  Data from screening 
calls, intervention contacts and participant surveys will be entered into REDCap forms that the data 
manager will check for completion and accuracy.  The data  manager will provide semi -monthly reports of 
missing or inappropriate entries to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_228257]. Standardized electronic data 
validation checks will be developed within the database constructs using data entry discrepancy flags, 
programmed query rules, and in certain cases, external rules using SAS code.  Monthly reports in 
aggregate and by [CONTACT_228323], completeness of follow -up, and study 
withdrawals.  Periodic reports will be generated  at the request of the Project Manager or the Principal 
Investigator.  The Data Manager will generate all these reports, working collaboratively with the 
Biostatistician and study staff.  T he reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the st udy 
will be recorded on the Case Report Form ( CRF), tracked in REDCap, and reported to the DSMB . Subjects 
orally  consent and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Subjects 
who orally  consent and are randomized and receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, 
or are discontinued from the study  will not be replaced.  
7.[ADDRESS_274896] be taken if a participant is unreachable by [CONTACT_464]:  
• Study staff will seek to contact [CONTACT_228324], or the patient of an unreachable 
family.   
• Study staff will query the electronic health record or ask primary care clinic staff if the patient has 
moved or had a change in health status.   
• If these efforts are not successful, the participant will be noted as having been lost to follow up.   
If a patient/family dyad are lost to follow -up, we will use all available data that are observed on that dyad 
in analyses.  For patients  who are lost to death, we will attempt bereavement surveys with family 
caregivers two to three months after death, following best practices.

 24 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
A description of the screening and enrollment procedures is provided in section 5.5 of this protocol.  
Participants will be assessed at baseline (after consent and before randomization)  (B6, C3), and 6  (B7, C4), 
12 (B8, C5), and 24 months  (B9, C6) post -randomization.  Bereavement surveys will be administered  via 
telphone or web survey  to enrolled family caregivers two to three months after the death of the patient 
in lieu of subsequent assessments  (C7). For the 6, 12, and 24 - month surveys, the window for dat a 
collection will be +/ - 30. We will attempt bereavement surveys with family caregivers two to three months 
after death, following best practices.  A summary of information to be collected from participants at each 
assessment are  further elaborated on in the text that follows and discussed in detail in section 9.0 of this 
protocol . 
   
 
Enrollment  
Enrollment officially occurs at the time of providing informed oral consent (see  exhibit,  above ), or at such 
a time that it is confirmed by [CONTACT_228325] a research staff member and orally consented to participate . Enrollment occurs prior 

Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October 202 3 
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 25 to patient and caregiver participants’ completion of the baseline assessment and randomization  The date 
of study enrollment will be tracked and documented for each participant.  
 
Baseline Assessments  
Study staff will administer baseline patient surveys  (B6). Caregivers will be given the option to self -
administer the baseline survey on hard (paper) copy or using a REDCap survey link . The following 
information, further detailed in the Schedule of Evaluations (see 6.1  of our Manual of Procedures ) will be 
collected during survey s at baseline:  
• Patient characteristics (demographic factors, health status, interpersonal relationships with 
caregiver and family, quality of life)  
• Family caregiver characteristics (demographic factors, health status, interpersonal relationship 
with patient and family, caregiving intensity and appraisal)  
• Primary care interactions and communication (therapeutic alliance, shared decision -making, 
frequency and mode of contacts, use of patient portal)  
• Patient and family experiences (quality of communication, engagement in advance care planning)  
• Alert events, adverse events  
 
After providing informed consent ( A1), primary care clinicians will be asked to provide their 
demographic information and information about characteristics of their practice in a brief questionnaire 
(A2). Clinicians will be asked to allow research staff to identify potentially eligible established patients 
who are scheduled for an upcoming visit from the clinic’s electronic scheduling system.  
 
ACP facilitators / interventionists  will complete a baseline assessment prior to training ( E2, E3) and a 
post -training survey  (E4) upon completion of the training . 
 
Follow -up Assessments  
The window during which surveys are conducted will be +/ - 90 days for each regularly scheduled follow -
up assessment as noted in the Schedule of Evaluations. The following information, further detailed in 
the Schedule of Evaluations (see 6.1) will be collected at 6  (B7, C4), 12 (B8, C5), and 24 months  (B9, C6) 
follow -up: 
• Patient characteristics (health status, living arrangement, mutuality with family caregiver, 
quality of life)  
• Family caregiver characteristics (health status, living arrangement, mutuality with older adult, 
caregiving intensity and appraisal)  
• Primary care interactions and communication (therapeutic alliance, shared decision -making, 
frequency and mode of contacts, use of patient portal)  
• Patient and family experiences (quality of communication, engagement in advance care 
planning)  
• Alert events, adverse events  
 
Should participants be screened positive for symptoms of depression or anxiety, they will be notified of 
this finding  (G1). They will be asked if they would like an educational brochure about depression  (G4, 
G5) or anxiety  (G3. G5) (as appropriate), or if they would like the interventionist to notify their primary 
care clinician of this finding  (G2).  
 
Primary care clinicians will be asked to provide follow -up information about characteristics of their 
practice in a brief survey after all patients have been enrolled ( A4).

Follow up assessments for ACP facilitators/ interventionists are detailed in section 6  of this protocol .  
 
Completion/Final Evaluation  
If a clinician drops out before randomization occurs, he/she will be replaced.  If a clinician drops out 
after randomization, but patient/family dyads are evaluable, we will perform an intent -to-treat analysis 
for that dyad.  If a patient/family dyad are l ost to follow -up, we will use all available data that are 
observed on that dyad in analyses.  For patients who are lost to death, we will attempt bereavement 
surveys (C7) with  family caregivers two to three months after death, following best practices.  Patients 
and/ or caregivers that are assigned to the intervention who have completed the study, including those 
who are lost to death , will be invited to share their experience with the intervention through a final 
qualitative telephone/ video interview.  The following information, further detailed in the Schedule of 
Evaluations (see 6.1) will be collected:  
• Quality of end -of-life care, receipt of burdensome care at the end of life  
• Surrogate decision -making experience (decisional conflict, decisional regret)  
• Family caregiver symptoms of anxiety and depression  
• Adverse events  
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
Participant safety will be monitored following the protocol outlined in our Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan  and Manual of Procedures .  We follow the Office of Human Research Protections’ guidance in our 
approach to defining and identifying Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events, and Unanticipated 
Problems.  A description of safety assessments and reporting is further  described in the following text .     
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
We follow the Office of Human Research Protections’ guidance in our approach to defining and identifying 
Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events, and Unanticipated Problems.  Adverse events are any untoward 
or unfavorable medical occurrence, including any abnormal sign, symptom, or disease identified by [CONTACT_228326].  Advance care  planning is already routinely 
offered in primary care and uptake of intervention processes will be at the discretion of patients and 
families.   Based on our previous work and studies in this area by [CONTACT_2312], there is a small risk that 
participants will become anxious/agitated due to the prospect or experience of advance care planning. 
Adverse events that result from study participation are expect ed to be mild and psychological in nature. 
Interventionists  will be trained to monitor, record, and manage such events and make effective referral.  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious adverse events  are any adverse event temporally associated with research participation that: 1) 
results in death; 2) is life -threatening; 3) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 4) results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 5) results in a co ngenital 
anomaly/birth defect; or 6) any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outco mes listed in this definition.  This is a minimal risk behavioral intervention and we do not 
anticipate any serious adverse events. The trial will be conducted in a population of older adults 80 years 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October 202 3 
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 27 and older with cognitive impairment and the significance of our study rests in part on low completion of 
advance care planning in the target population despi[INVESTIGATOR_228258] 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency depart ment visits). We will monitor rates of serious adverse events by 
[CONTACT_228279] a part of our analytic plan, but these events will not be systematically included in 
safety reporting as it is improbable that they will result from the intervention. If any d eaths should occur, 
they will be reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_228259] 24 hours of initial notification.     
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern. Moderate events may cause 
some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
Relatedness of adverse events, serious adverse events, and unanticipated problems will be evaluated on 
the basis of temporality and relation to intervention processes.  Specifically, we will determine whether 
the event occurred subsequent to the patient/fa mily having engaged in an advance care planning and 
having been triggered or caused by [CONTACT_228327]/or other processes and activities related to the intervention protocol .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
Unanticipated problems  are unexpected, related or possibly related to participation in research, and 
suggest that participating in research poses greater risk of physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm than previously known or recognized.  Given the minimal risk of th e study, the voluntary nature of 
patient/family participation, and the availability of advance care planning in mainstream primary care, 
unexpected problems are unlikely. Nevertheless, we will monitor the emergence of any unanticipate d 
problems in the Aim [ADDRESS_274897] s. 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
Should a significant adverse event occur that is unanticipated and related to the intervention, it will be 
reported to NIA Program Officer and to the DSMB Chair or to the designated DSMB member within 48 
hours of the study’s knowledge of the significant ad verse event. All other significant adverse events will 
be reported to the NIA Program Officer and to the DSMB (or a Safety Officer) quarterly. Given that some 
advance care planning visits may occur in people’s homes, there is the potential that facilitators will 
encounter a potential emergency situation that is not related to study participation (e.g., dehydration, 
environmental risk, medical eme rgency). We refer to such events as safety  alerts  and have well 
developed procedures for monitoring and management (see adverse event reporting procedures 
below). All safety alerts will be reported to the NIA Program Office and DSMB semiannually.

 28 8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Adverse events will be reported per IRB policies.  All members of the DSMB will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_228260]. In 
addition, a listing of all adverse events a nd their attribution (e.g., study related, intervention related, or 
unrelated to study or treatment) will be provided to the DSMB biannually.  
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Should a significant adverse event occur that is unanticipated and related to the intervention, it will be 
reported to NIA Program Officer and to the DSMB Chair or to the designated DSMB member within 48 
hours of the study’s knowledge of the significant ad verse event. All other significant adverse events will 
be reported to the NIA Program Officer and to the DSMB (or a Safety Officer) quarterly.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 29 Objectives and hypotheses related to primary outcomes are as follows:  
 
We test the efficacy of SHARE on quality of communication (primary outcome) and advance care planning 
processes (secondary outcomes) at 6 months among primary care patients with cognitive impairment 
(mild -severe) and family caregiver dyads. We hypothesize that as compared with the control group, 
caregivers in the intervention group will report better quality of communication about end of life care 
with primary care clinicians at 6 months (primary outcome).   
 
Objectives and hypotheses related to secondary outcomes are as follows:  
 
We further test the efficacy of SHARE on advance care planning processes at 6 months.  We hypothesize 
that intervention caregivers will be more highly engaged in advance care planning than control caregivers 
as measured by [CONTACT_84452] -reported readiness to engage in ad vance care planning and having documented 
advance directive in the patient’s electronic health record at [ADDRESS_274901] deviation units (SDUs).51,[ADDRESS_274902] 
size of 0.39 SDUs. Based on an enrolled sample of about 248 dyads and attrition of 10%, a retained sample 
of 222 will provide more than 80% power to detect a covariate -adjusted effect of 0.[ADDRESS_274903] 50% 
mortality by 24 months. With 124 observations, power exceeds 80% to detect decreases of 20% or more 
in burdensome care (e.g. 30% vs. 10%). Assuming 25% attrition, 92 surrogate responses will be sufficient 
to monitor the effects of SHARE on sat isfaction with end -of-life care, surrogate decision -making, and 
bereaved family outcomes; measures that are essential to assessment of quality of end -of-life care, as 
well as provide effect sizes to guide future trials of advance care planning in primary c are populations.

Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October [ADDRESS_274905] the efficacy of SHARE on quality of 
communication (QOC) at 6 months. Analyses will be performed using SAS statistical software, with each 
dyad as the unit of analysis. We will use intention -to-treat analyses as the p rimary method of analysis; 
data from all participants will be analyzed as members of their assigned study group. Primary outcome : 
We will test the effects of SHARE on improved QOC compared to usual care at 6 months.  We will use 
hierarchical analyses of co variance on the 6 -month  (B7, C4 ) QOC score with treatment group as the 
primary independent variable and baseline QOC score as the primary covariate.  Other baseline 
characteristics (individual - or practice -level variables) will be covariates if there is imbalance on these 
measures by [CONTACT_228328] 6 -month QOC after adjusting for 
baseline QOC score.  A multilevel design will be implemented using SAS Proc MIXED with dyads (level 1) 
nested within clinics (level 2)  that will allow us to enter and control for clinic -level covariates (size and 
characteristics of patient panel, staff, location). Secondary outcomes and supplemental analyses : In 
addition to the primary outcome, numerous comparisons will be conducted for secondary outcomes, 
measures of implementation, and supplemental analyses for clinically relevant  subgroups and

For dichotomous outcomes (e.g., newly documented advance directive; burdensome care) we will 
construct multilevel logistic regression models using SAS Proc GLIMMIX. We will compute the effect size

relatively modest sample size available for some s econdary analyses, careful attention must be given to 
potential problems such as over -parameterization; thus only a limited number of covariates will be 
included in these models and potential interactions will be examined in separate models. We will examin e

indexing.131,134 Findings from qualitative analyses will be cross -tabulated with quantitative analyses of 
efficacy for convergence to clarify the mechanism by [CONTACT_228332].  
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Our sample encompasses persons with cognitive impairment, some of whom may be unable to respond 
to study assessments.  Therefore, primary outcomes at [ADDRESS_274907]. 135,136 
We examine two primary outcomes, as follows:   
 
Quality of Communication.  We assess family caregiver -reported quality of communication at 6 months, 
using the end -of-life subscale (n=7 items) of the validated instrument.137,138 The QOC has excellent internal 
consistency and strong evidence of reliability and validity: we focus on the end of life subscale which is 
most pertinent to advance care planning in the target population. We follow the question wording 
stipulated by [CONTACT_228333] (2006), with two modifications.  First, we have revised the question stem to reflect 
the perspective of the family.  Second, we have revised the question stem to reflect our interest in 
communication with the primary care team as opposed to “their doct or”.  
 
Satisfaction with Care at the End -of-Life in Dementia  (SWC -EOLD) is a 10 -item instrument measured on 
a 4-point Likert scale that ranges from 1 “strongly disagree” to 4 “strongly agree” with a summary score 
ranging from 10 -40 in which higher values indicate higher satisfaction.90,139,140  We field this instruments 
as originally described by [CONTACT_228334] 24 
months.  
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Two categories of secondary outcomes will be  assessed: measures of patient and family experiences at 
six-months, and bereaved family caregiver experiences , for patients who die .  Each are described in turn :   
 
Patient and Family Experiences  encompasses 3 metrics relating to  advance care planning as follows.  
1. Readiness to engage in advance care planning.  The Advance Care Planning Engagement Survey  is a 
validated patient -reported questionnaire that assesses advance care planning process measures 
(knowledge, contemplation, self -efficacy, and readiness) on a 5 -point Likert scale, and action 
measures (discussing and documenting advance care planning) usin g dichotomous (yes/no) 
response categories.141,[ADDRESS_274908] reliability, and 
discriminant validity, and is responsive to change141-143 but persons with cognitive impairment were 
excluded from its development and testing. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_228262] 2 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]60 we will examine the feasibility and psychometric properties of the an abbreviated version of 
the survey in the target population. The original 82 -item instrument took 49 minutes to administer, 
on average141 and although we planned to field the abbreviated 15 -item advance care planning 
engagement survey, 88 early work in a similar population suggested that respondents had a difficult 
Sharing Health Care Wishes in Primary Care   Version 9.0  
Protocol < IRB00242431  >  October 202 3 
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 35 time differentiating between questions, and the battery was perceived by [CONTACT_228335].  In this study we therefore field the 4 -item engagement instrument and draw on 
VanScoy’s work (2019) which identifies a parallel survey for  surrogate decision -makers involving 3 
factors that pertain to shared decision -making (7 items), contemplation (4 items), and readiness (6 
items). [ADDRESS_274909] closely paralleled the patient version (it ems 12 -14, and 16 from Van 
Scoy).  We modify question stems for several items to replace “loved one” with “your 
RELATIONSHIP” so the items are neutral with respect to relational quality.   
2. Documentation of advance directive completion in the electronic health record  is defined as 
having a durable power of attorney or a living will documented in the primary care electronic health 
record.51,144,145  We do not consider the Medical Order for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) in 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study or as an outcome of advance directive completion as the 
completion of a Maryland MOLST is mandatory in certain situations (e.g., on t ransfer between 
settings of care) and is not indicative of having had an advance care planning discussion or naming a 
durable power of attorney; the Maryland MOLST does not conform to the National POLST 
Paradigm.146,[ADDRESS_274910] Scale is a 16 -item instrument scored on a 5 -point Likert 
scale ranging from 1 to 5.91 Aggregate scores range from 0 (no conflict) to 100 (extremely high 
conflict). 91-[ADDRESS_274911] 
categorized scores of 0 as no regret, 1 to 25 as mild regret, and more than 25 as heightened 
regret.94-96   
3. Symptoms of anxiety. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 -item (GAD -7)97 is a validated instrument 
that ask about symptoms of anxiety using a two -week recall period with response categories that 
vary from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). Item responses are summed to construct 
composite scores.  
4. Burdensome care . Burdensome care will be measured by [CONTACT_228336] (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, dialysis, 
artificial nutrition, chemotherapy) within 30 days of death101,102 using dates and services abstracted 
from medical records and the Chesapeake Regional Information System (CRISP), Maryland’s Health

10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This is a Minimal Risk study of a behavioral intervention.  The trial will be conducted in a population of 
older adults 80 years and older with cognitive impairment and the significance of our study rests in part 
on low completion of advance care planning in the target population despi[INVESTIGATOR_228244] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency department visits).  Advance care planning is 
already routinely offered in primary care and uptake of intervention processes will be at the  discretion of 
patients and families.  Participants will be free to terminate their participation at any time and will be 
reminded of this during the consenting process.  Participants in the trial will be offered the intervention 
as a part of routine care and will be free to decline all aspects of intervention activities but will continue 
to be assessed according to intention to treat.

meeting content and progress using a Meeting Summary form. The Meeting Summary form includes 
details about the structure of the meeting (individuals present, location, meeting duration, etc.) as well 
as a checklist of key fidelity components  (E5).     
 
Trained research staff will review all audio -recorded meetings to monitor adherence to the advance care 
planning protocol.  Using the fidelity audit tool  (E10), the rater will listen to the recording, integrate 
information found in the field notes, and determine the rating for content and quality elements of each 
session.  Raters   will monitor for the delivery of problematic content, such as interventionist s offering 
pure opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], displaying impatience, or failing to respect patient or family values.  The study team will 
convene interventionis ts weekly during the first six months of the study, and then monthly thereafter.    
Additional elements of fidelity maint enance will include monitoring completion of field notes after each 
advance care planning session, holding weekly supervision sessions with interventionis ts (led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cagle) 
with the opportunity to discuss concerns noted in the field notes and review of intervention fidelity 
monitoring reports, quarterly booster   sessions with the interventionists to maintain delivery skill and 
identify potential drift, a nd remediation and retesting in response to identified deficiencies or drift in 
quality of interventi on delivery.     
 
We will evaluate the extent to which patients and family caregivers avail themselves to therapeutic 
elements of the intervention relating to advance care planning conversations and interactions with 
primary care clinicians and their team about wishes for f uture medical care and goals of care.  A monthly 
report will be generated to track the number, duration, and mode of all contacts with the advance care 
planning facilitator /interventionis t, the content of advance care planning discussions, as well as 
regis tration for the patient portal by [CONTACT_228321]. The report will produce 
information by [CONTACT_228322].  This level of detail will permit the team to identify areas 
where full implementation is not being achieved and enable corrective actions. If potentially problematic 
content during meetings is noted, it will be flagged for review during supervision meetings. This 
information will be used to descriptively characterize the intervention group at each data collectio n time 
point and as it relates to outcomes. In this study we endeavor to complete at least one advance care 
planning discussion for each person -family dyad assigned to the intervention group; ideally within [ADDRESS_274923]  KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_228266] 9.0

 41 [IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
To minimize participant burden and disruption to primary care practices, the study team will obtain oral 
informed consent  (B4, C2, D4 ) and conduct a written or electronic baseline survey (B6, C3) prior to 
randomization. Contextual information about how oral consent is obtained  will be stored in REDCap. 
Follow -up and bereavement assessments will be conducted by [CONTACT_228343]  (C7). Follow -up and bereaved assessments obtained via web survey will 
be stored  in REDCap.  Measures of advance directive completion, use of the patient portal, and 
burdensome care will be extracted from the electronic health record and the Maryland CRISP by [CONTACT_228344]. Data collection will be the responsibility of res earch staff under the 
supervision of the research program manager and primary investigator.  
 
All data will be maintained in confidentiality, and confidentiality protections will be included in study staff 
research training.  Data collection will employ standardized data forms.  Data from screening calls, 
intervention contacts and participant surve ys will be entered into REDCap forms that the data manager 
will check for completion and accuracy.  The data manager will provide semi -monthly reports of missing 
or inappropriate entries to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_228257]. Standardized electronic d ata validation 
checks will be developed within the database constructs using data entry discrepancy flags, programmed 
query rules, and in certain cases, external rules using SAS code.  Monthly reports in aggregate and by [CONTACT_228345], completeness of follow -up, and study withdrawals.  Periodic 
reports will be generated at the request of the Project Manager or the Principal Investigator.  The Data 
Manager will generate all these reports, working collaboratively with the Bi ostatistician and study staff.  
The study database will comply with current data security standards, provide real -time data entry 
validation, and provide audit trails documenting changes or corrections of the study data.  Data entry or 
review will require logging into a secure portal with a username [CONTACT_2383].  The database is hosted 
by [CONTACT_228346] -compliant.

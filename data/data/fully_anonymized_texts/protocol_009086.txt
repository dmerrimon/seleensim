2  INTRODUCTION 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains one of our gr eatest unmet medical needs, without any approved disease-
modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Both animal data and recent clinical trial results with anti-amyloid agents suggest that our 
previous attempts to intervene may have been “too little, t oo late.”  Fortunately, a number of trials in both genetic 
and biomarker at-risk older individuals thought to be in the prec linical stages of AD, as well as trials in the clinical 
stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or prodromal AD , are underway or currently being planned.  However, 
the timeframe, complexity and expense of the recr uitment process and site activation for these secondary 
prevention trials are extremely challenging, and indeed site  start-up and trial enrollment, in general, represent the 
greatest bottleneck for drug development for AD. Moreover, it is likely that future early-stage trials will move even 
earlier in the process of amyloid accumulation prior to the st age of “amyloid positivity”.  These prevention trials 
will increasingly rely on remote electronic contact [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a ssessments due to the need to screen large number of 
individuals and follow participants over long periods of time. Thus, there is growing consensus that we must 
fundamentally overhaul the current clinical trial recruitm ent and assessment process for these early intervention 
trials. The overarching goal of this protocol is to accelerate current and future secondary prevention trial 
enrollment through an innovative, highly efficient approach to identify, evaluate, and enroll appropriate preclinical 
and prodromal trial candidates, supported by a new site ne twork with enhanced capacities for more efficient and 
effective conduct of AD clinical trials.   
2.2 OVERVIEW 
TRC-PAD is an ambitious program, addressing wide-ranging issues in trial recruitment and site management.  To 
succeed, it will build on existing efforts by [CONTACT_731128], web-based consent, innovative 
cognitive assessments, biostatistics, and multiple existing registry programs.  
The feeder registries (Brain Health Registry, Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry, HealthyBrains.org, et al.) will filter 
participants based on age and cognitive status and invite olde r individuals not meeting criteria for dementia to 
enroll in the APT Webstudy, which in turn will conduct unsupe rvised, web-based capture of demographic, medical, 
lifestyle and genetic factors, as well as longitudinal  web-based cognitive testing and symptom questionnaires, to 
assess their risk of elevated brain amyloid.  The initial ri sk algorithm is derived from analysis of an existing study 
data.  This algorithm is then iteratively updated thro ugh an appropriate regression-based statistical approach to 
biomarker testing results.   
The individuals at highest risk within the APT Webstudy pool of asymptomatic (preclinical) and very mildly 
symptomatic (prodromal) individuals will be referred for in -person clinical and biomarker assessments at select AD 
clinical trial sites.  Those who are identified with biomarker profiles indicative of AD pathology, including 
asymptomatic individuals with minimally elevated or “intermediate” levels of  amyloid, will be e ligible for the in-
clinic trial-ready cohort (TRC), where they will be followe d at semi-annual in person visits until they are ready for 
enrollment in preclinical/prodromal therapeutic trials, wh ile continuing quarterly, remote, web-based cognitive 
assessments in the APT Webstudy. Biomarker-negative i ndividuals will continue remote web-based follow-up in 
the APT Webstudy; if longitudinal trajectories and changes to other risk factors indicate increasing risk, those 
participants will be eligible for repeat in-person clin ical and biomarker assessment. Participants with known

APT Webstudy. 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET) 
The primary risk related to PET imaging is that of r adiation exposure associated with the injected radiotracers and 
accompanying CT (if a PET/CT scanner is used). There is also  minor risk associated with the venipuncture, 
placement of an intravenous catheter, and radioisotope inje ction (pain and bruising or painful infiltration of a 
failed injection).  
Any of the following radiotracers may be utilized for amyloid imaging in this study:   
• florbetaben (Neuraceq),  
• florbetapir (Amyvid)  
• flutemetamol (Vizamyl)  
• NAV-4694 (Flutafuranol) 
Specific risk information for florbetaben, florbetapi r and flutemetamol can be found in their corresponding  
Package Insert.  Specific risk information for NAV-[ADDRESS_998653] will be ineligible for amyloid 
PET imaging.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LUMBAR PUNCTURE (LP) 
Lumbar puncture may be associated with pain during the pe rformance of the procedure. This is usually temporary 
and confined to the lower back. Headache may occur in about 5% of elderly people who undergo lumbar puncture. 
Less commonly, in about 1-4% of participants, a persist ent low-pressure headache may develop, probably due to 
leakage of CSF. Lower rates of post-LP headache have b een noted in elderly patients, and when atraumatic 
(Sprotte) needles are used. If a post-LP headache persists it  may need additional treatm ent, e.g. additional fluids 
and analgesics. Uncommonly a blood patch (i njection of some of the participant’s blood to patch the CSF leak) may 
be needed. Potential but rare risks of lumbar punctur e include infection, damage to nerves in the back, and 
bleeding into the CSF space. The risk of these is much less than 1%. In an effort to mitigate these risks, an 
experienced clinician must perform the LP. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  GENETIC RISKS 
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_998654] to minimize this risk. 
Another possible risk from participation in this study i nvolves a loss of privacy as a result of providing genetic 
material (nucleic acids) for research.  Although genetic inf ormation is unique to each individual it is also shared 
with their children, parents, brothers, sisters, other bl ood relatives and other members of their ethnic group. 
Methods to allow someone to link the genetic or medical information back to the study participant could be 
developed in the future but authorized users agree to not attempt to identify any study participants. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PSYCHOLOGICAL RISKS OF REFERRAL FROM THE APT WEBSTUDY 
When a participant is identified as having increased risk  for future development of AD based on their profile and 
performance in the APT Webstudy, they will be contact[CONTACT_731129]-clinic evaluation 
to have their increased risk explained and to consent for screening to join the in-clinic TRC-PAD cohort. Participants 
deemed ineligible at the in-clinic evaluation may be re ferred for further clinical evaluation of a non-AD diagnosis 
and/or returned to the APT Webstudy for continued track ing. Risks associated with this process include negative 
outlook based on the invitation for further evaluation of me mory performance as part of the APT Webstudy. In the 
case of individuals referred from other studies where thei r amyloid status may be known, they might be referred 
to in-clinic evaluation to join the TRC-PAD cohort if eligible. These individuals may therefore by[CONTACT_731130]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PSYCHOLOGICAL RISKS FROM ELIGIBILITY RESULTS  
Once eligibility testing is performed there will be an eligibility discussion session where results about study 
eligibility and increased risk for future development of AD w ill be shared with participants. It is possible that some 
participants may be upset by [CONTACT_731131] r TRC eligibility assessment which indicates an increased 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_731112]. However, in recent st udies, there was no deleterious effect of learning about 
increased risk for AD by [CONTACT_731132] (Pontecorvo, Avid A18 study, 
Dementia Ger Cog Disord 2017; Mozersky et al, 2018 Sokrates  study, JAMA Neurology).  The Imaging Dementia – 
Evidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) study, led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rabinovici, has scanned over 18,[ADDRESS_998655] been reported.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LOSS OF PRIVACY 
In this study, a great deal of information about participant health status is collected. Study staff at the clinic sites 
will be collecting personal protected health informat ion such as name, date of birth, address, phone number, and 
emails. All participants will be given a participant code numbe r as part of the in-clinic TRC, and all data collected 
under this protocol will be associated with the code numbe r. The data, associated with the code number, will be 
shared widely, but it will not be possible to identify an individual participant from the data. However, there is a 
very unlikely possibility that there will be a security fa ilure, and that somehow the protected health information 
will be no longer protected. This is an extremely unlikel y but possible occurrence and is a risk of this study. 
TRC Version 4.1

to participate in AD prevention clinical trials.  Volunt eering for the study may be associated with a sense of 
altruism and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_731113] a serious disease affecting many people. 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Although there is some risk associated with PET imaging  (e.g. radiation exposure) and lumbar puncture (pain), the 
benefits of enrolling in a prevention study for AD are far greater, as there are currently no treatments for the prevention of AD and the opportunity to have access to medi cations that slow the development of AD dementia 
outweighs these risks.  
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 
Aim 1: To build an efficient and sustainable recruitment sy stem in order to enroll and retain an initial TRC-PAD 
Cohort. This approach will markedly accelerate recruitment time lines, shorten time to site activation for trials, and 
reduce unexplained variance in pre-trial cognitive testing, as compared to current recruitment approaches.   
Aim 2: To optimize an innovative, adaptive risk algorithm  to efficiently identify the most appropriate trial 
participants. Once optimized, this algorithm will be able to  select amyloid positive individuals (and eventually tau 
and other neurodegenerative biomarkers) with >75% accur acy, greatly reducing future costly biomarker screen 
fails.   
Aim 3: To develop and validate web-based cognitive and funct ional outcome measures for future clinical trials.  
Baseline and longitudinal cognitive performance (including lack of practice effect on repeated web-based cognitive 
tests), decline on performance based functional measure s, and a combination of self- and study-partner report will 
predict and subsequently track with in-person measures of cognitive (PACC) and funct ional (CDR-SB) decline.

biomarker-positive individuals into prec linical and prodromal AD clinical trials. 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
The rationale for the study design is to develop and utilize the APT Webstudy and the TRC cohort to accelerate AD 
prevention trial enrollment through an innovative, highl y efficient approach to identify, evaluate, and enroll 
appropriate preclinical and prodromal trial candidates as  the current methods of recruitment for prevention 
studies is slow and has extremely high screen fail rates (~80%) and adds years to the duration of such studies.

not physiologically significant. 
10. Clinically significant abnormalities in screening laboratories. 
11. For participants undergoing CSF collection: a current bl ood clotting or bleeding disorder, or significantly 
abnormal PT or PTT at screening or if on anti-coagulation (e.g. warfarin) 
12. Participants whom the Site PI d eems to be otherwise ineligible. 
• Site PIs should consult with the Coordinating Center on any issues that may disqualify the 
participant from participation in future clinical trials to determine whether enrollment into TRC 
would be appropriate.  
Exceptions to these guidelines may be considered on a case- by-case basis at the discretion of the Project Director 
and Coordinating Center. 
5.3 SCREEN FAILURES 
Screen failures are defined as participants who do not meet inclusion criteria or do meet exclusionary criteria and 
therefore are not entered in the TRC cohort. A minimal set of screen failure reasons is required to ensure 
transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 
(CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities.  
Individuals who screen fail on the basis of amyloid results,  may be rescreened in the future with approval by [CONTACT_731135], if cognitively impaired, may be referred by [CONTACT_731136]-AD 
diagnosis.  
Screen fail participants may continue in the APT Webstudy  for ongoing remote, longitudi nal monitoring of their 
cognitive performance to assess for any increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314].

accelerate enrollment of participants into clinical trials, enrollment into TRC is anticipated to continue over the 
entire study period and may exceed 2,000 participants.   
6   PET TRACERS 
Each participant receiving a PET scan for eligibility confirma tion will be scanned with an Amyloid PET tracer – which 
tracer is used will be determined based on availability at the site for this study.  Amyloid PET results will be 
generated centrally using quantitative metrics to assess level of amyloidosis, and eligibility information for 
continuing in the TRC cohort will be returned to site.

Florbetaben will be provided by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_731114]. One mL (1 mL) of the solution for each injection/vial contains 
300 MBq of florbetaben. The other ingredients are asco rbic acid, ethanol anhydrous, macrogol 400, sodium 
ascorbate, and water for injections.  Image acquisition shoul d begin 90 minutes after injection.  The effective dose 
resulting from a 300 MBq (8.1 mCi) administration of Neur aceq in adult participants is 5.[ADDRESS_998666] ion of Neuraceq images (as done in PET/CT imaging) will 
add radiation exposure. Diagnostic head CT scans using he lical scanners administer an average of 2.2 ± 1.3 mSv 
effective dose (CRCPD Publication E-07-2, 2007). The actual radiation dose is operator and scanner dependent. 
Thus, the total combined radiation exposure from Neuraceq administration and subsequent scan on a PET/CT 
scanner is estimated to be 8 mSv.    
Florbetapir (Amyvid) :   
Scanning entails 10mCi injection of tracer administe red through an intravenous line and a 50-minute uptake until 
20-minute image acquisition begins. Image acquisition occurs ove r a 20-minute period. The effective dose resulting 
from a 370 MBq (10 mCi) dose of Amyvid is 7.0 mSv in an adult, (19 x 370 = 7030 μSv = 7.030 mSv). The use of a CT 
scan to calculate attenuation correction for reconstructi on of Amyvid images (as done in PET/CT imaging) will add 
radiation exposure. Diagnostic head CT scans using heli cal scanners administer an average of 2.2 ± 1.3 mSv 
effective dose (CRCPD Publication E-07-2, 2007). The ac tual radiation dose is operator and scanner dependent. The

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   12 total radiation exposure from Amyvid administration and s ubsequent scan on a PET/CT scanner is estimated to be 
9 mSv.  
Flutemetamol (Vizamyl) :   
The recommended dose for Vizamyl is 185 megabecquerels (M Bq) [5 millicuries (mCi)] in a maximum dose volume 
of 10 mL, administered as a single intravenous bolus  within 40 seconds. The maximum mass dose is 20 
micrograms. Follow the injection with an intravenous flush of 5 to 15 mL of 0.9% sterile sodium chloride injection. 
NAV-4694 (Flutafuranol) :   
The recommended dose is 8.1 mCi (300 MBq) (± 10%) of [18F]NAV-4694 will be injected intravenously followed by 
[CONTACT_731137] 15-20 mL of normal saline. The  Investigator’s Brochure has additional details regarding this 
amyloid radiotracer.  
7 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
7.1 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE IN-CLINIC TRC STUDY 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in  the study at any time upon request. An investigator may 
discontinue or withdraw a participant from  the study for any reason. Examples include: 
• Participant develops dementia: Any participant who develops dementia will be discontinued from the 
study at the next follow up visit. 
• Adverse experience:  The participant has experienced an adverse event that requires early termination. 
This may include abnormal laboratory values. 
• Death 
• Protocol violation:  The participant fails to meet  protocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol 
requirements. 
• Non-compliance: The participant is non-compliant  with completion of study-related evaluations. 
• In the investigator’s judgment, it is in the partici pant’s best interest to discontinue participation in the 
study. 
• Consent is withdrawn.  The participant wishes to wi thdraw from the study, or the legally authorized 
representative wish the participant to be withdrawn.  
• Lost to follow up.  Participant could not be recalled back to conduct follow up visits. 
• Loss of informed study partner.  The participant no longer has an informed study partner.

• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_731138] 30 days or at the 
discretion of the PI. The site will also counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant  wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the i nvestigator or designee will make every effort to 
regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 2 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter 
to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_78779]’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he  or she will be considered to have withdrawn from 
the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
8.1 CLINICAL AND COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS  
 
8.1.1  PRESCREEN PHASE  
During the prescreen phase, participants will be enrolle d in the APT Webstudy and once triggered for increased 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314], will be referred to in-person clinic al evaluation. Participants for whom evidence of brain 
amyloid has already been confirmed, may be referred for in-person clinical evaluation to participate in TRC and 
by[CONTACT_731139]. 
Prior amyloid testing, when applicable, should be confirmed prior to screening. 
8.1.2  SCREENING  
The purpose of the Screening Visit is to further determine eligibility for the TRC cohort and to complete the 
informed consent. The screening procedures will be conducted  as outlined in the Schedule of Activities (section 
1.3). 
Procedures may be performed on separate days as long as all procedures are conducted within the visit window.  
Screening Stages [ADDRESS_998670] be completed within a 60- day window.  Screening stage 3 should be completed 
within 84 days of the start of screening activities. It is  acceptable to delay some assessments if the study cannot be 
properly conducted due the COVID-19 pandemic. In these cases, reach out to the Coordinating Center for 
additional guidance. 
Screening Stage 1 data will be centrally reviewed prior to site being authorized to proceed with Stage 2 (amyloid 
testing via PET or CSF) and again prior to the site being aut horized to proceed with Stage 3 (eligibility discussion).  
Sites may not proceed with Stages [ADDRESS_998671] will be ineligible for amyloid PET 
imaging. 
Screening visit procedures may be repeated if clinically ne cessary (e.g. to follow-up on an abnormality identified on 
clinical labs) or if data from the initial procedur e is not analyzable (e.g. PET scan QC failure).   
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   14 [IP_ADDRESS]  BIOMARKER CONFIRMATION USING SHARED IMAGES AND/OR RESULTS  
Participants who have previously undergone amyloid testing via PET or CSF under another research study may 
provide consent to have their PET scan, CSF sample, PET scan results and/or CSF results shared with the 
Coordinating Center for the purposes of biom arker confirmation at Screening Stage 2.   
In such instances, approval from the sponsor of the other research study may be required prior to sharing of data 
or images.   The Coordinating Center will work with  the site and, if needed, the study sponsor on securely 
transferring the relevant data, ensuring that no identifiable information is shared with the Coordinating Center.  
The following are examples of how data may be shared with TRC: 
• PET scan or CSF sample – scan/sample will be submitted to the Coordinating Center using standard 
submission procedures for central analysis 
• PET or CSF analysis results (e.g. quantitative data) – data will be transmitted from the study sponsor or 
site to the Coordinating Center for review and  evaluation against TRC entry requirements 
• A report indicating that the participant was deemed eligible for a particular study based on amyloid 
testing results – report will be transmitted from the study sponsor or site to the Coordinating Center for 
review and evaluation against TRC entry requirements 
To the extent possible, data will be incorporated into the TRC data sets and will be shared along with other TRC 
data as described in Section 10, however this may not be possible if the study sponsor requires restrictions on data 
sharing with the site or with other investigators.    
In the event that a participant consents to having prior results shared, but the study sponsor does not provide their 
approval for sharing, the site investigator will consult wi th the Coordinating Center to obtain approval prior to 
enrollment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  WELLNESS TELEPHONE CHECK  
Telephone calls will be made to participants within [ADDRESS_998672] udy period at the discretion of the Site PI.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ELIGIBILITY DISCUSSION  
Participants deemed eligible for TRC enrollment fo llowing completion of all screening procedures, including 
amyloid testing, will meet with a licensed clinician (M.D., M.B.B.S., N.P., D.O., PA-C, A. P.R.N.) in person to discuss 
their eligibility for the study.  A telephone call rather than in -person discussion of eligibility results may be done at 
the discretion of the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_731115]:  
• For eligible participants who had previously been di sclosed results of prior amyloid testing. 
• For ineligible participants.  
Participants who are ineligible for TRC may remain in the APT Webstudy.    
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   15 For participants having an in-person discussion of eligib ility results, the Concerns about Alzheimer’s Disease 
Questionnaire and Future Time perspective Scale will be administered following the discussion and a 72-hour 
wellness telephone check will be conducted that include s administration of the Impact of Events Scale.   
8.1.3  ACTIVE STUDY PHASE (ONGOING 6-MONTH ASSESSMENTS)  
The remaining study procedures will be conducted as outlined in Schedule of Activities (section 1.3).  Timing of 
each follow-up visit is calculated from the start of scr eening.  Procedures for each visit may be completed over 
multiple days but must occur within the window of +/-21 days from the visit’s target date.   
Screening visit procedures may be repeated at follow-up vi sits, with approval from the Coordinating Center, if 
needed to assess potential changes in eligibility for clinical  trials, e.g. after participation in a clinical trial or 
prolonged enrollment in TRC without successful enrollment in a trial.   
8.1.4  PHYSICAL AND NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION  
A physical and neurological exam ination will be performed at each visit as listed in SOA (section 1.3) by a medically 
qualified, licensed clinician.  The physical examination w ill consist of a review of the major body systems (i.e. skin, 
HEENT (head/ears/eyes/ nose/throat), cardiovascular, pulm onary, abdomen, musculoskeletal, and extremities).   
Neurological examination will include an assessment of crani al nerves, strength, coordination, reflexes, sensation, 
tremor, gait and mental status.  
8.1.5  VITAL SIGNS  
Vital signs will be collected at each visit as indicated in  SOA (section 1.3) and include weight, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, pulse, temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487].  Height will be taken at the screening visit only. 
8.1.6  MEDICAL HISTORY  
The participant’s lifetime medical history will be collected as listed in SOA (section 1.3). Medical history includes 
previous and current diseases, psychiatric history, and substance use history.  
8.1.7  COGNITIVE, FUNCTIONAL, AND WELL-BEING ASSESSMENTS  
Study participants will undergo the following cognitive and functional assessments: 
• PACC (PACC) :  The PACC is a composite measure that comprises the Total Recall score from the Free and 
Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), the Delayed Paragr aph Recall score on the Logical Memory Iia test 
from the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Digit-Symbol S ubstitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale-Revised, and the MMSE total score (Mormino et al. 2017). Psychometrists administering the PACC 
are required to complete an PACC training and certif ication process. The administration of the PACC will 
be recorded (audio only) for quality review purpos es and for additional analyses according to locally 
applicable laws and regulations. 
• COGNITIVE FUNCTION INDEX Index (CFI) :  The CFI is a modified version of the Mail-in Cognitive Function 
Screening Instrument, a participant- and study partner -reported outcome (patient-reported outcome) 
measure. This assessment includes 15 questions that a ssess the participant’s perceived ability to perform 
high level functional tasks in daily-life and their sens e of overall cognitive functional (Walsh et al. 2006; 
Amariglio et al. 2015)  
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   16 • CLINICAL DEMENTIA RATING SCALE SUM OF BOXES (CDR-SB) :  The CDR-SB37, 38 is a clinical scale that rates 
the severity of dementia as absent, questionable, mild, moderate, or severe (global CDR scores of 0, 0.5, 
1, 2, or 3, respectively). The score is based on in terviews with the participant and study partner, using a 
structured interview that assesses six domains: memo ry, orientation, judgment and problem solving, 
community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care.  The  Sum of Boxes score affords a more refined 
measure of change.  Reliability and validity of both global and SB scores have been established. 
• CONCERNS ABOUT ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE: Concerns about Alzheimer’s Disease is a short self-report 
instrument about one’s concern about developi[INVESTIGATOR_731116]’s disease dementia. It is adapted from 
Roberts and Connell 2000. 
• IMPACT OF EVENTS SCALE : The IES (Horowitz et al. 1979) is a 15-item self-report measure that assesses 
two common responses related to a specific stressful  life event: intrusion and avoidance.  It is a reliable 
scale that can be anchored to any specific life event and permits the assessment of participants over time, 
comparison of the degree of distress among subgroups, and comparison of the impact of various events. 
The IES has been anchored to test-related distress in previous genetic testing studies and has been 
adapted for amyloid testing related distress.  
• FUTURE TIME PERSPECTIVE SCALE : The Future Time Perspective scale (Roberts 2000; Lang and 
Carstensen 2002) measures a person’s perception of his or her remaining time which in turn has been 
shown to explain the priority of specific goals. 
• ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING (STAI, GDS) : The Assessment of Psychological Well Being 
is composed of questions from a validated s hortened version (Marteau and Bekker 1992) of the “state 
anxiety” portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_57601]. 1983) and from the Geriatric 
Depression Scale (GDS; Sheikh and Yesavage 1986). It is a self-report assessment designed to identify 
symptoms of anxiety and depression in the elderly.  The anxiety portion of the assessment consists of [ADDRESS_998673] indicates on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) on how much of a given 
anxiety symptom they are currently experiencing to assess anxiety level. The depression portion of the 
assessment has [ADDRESS_998674]. Answers 
to 5 of the items are negatively oriented for depr ession (for example, Do you feel full of energy?) and 10 
positively oriented (for example, Do you often feel helpless?).  
8.[ADDRESS_998675] fasting status 
on the relevant eCRF.   
Prior to lumbar puncture (LP), a coagulation panel and platel et count will be obtained to rule out a clotting 
disorder.   Labs will be analyzed locally or centrally wi thin 3 months prior to the LP.  Participants taking an anti-
platelet agent (e.g. aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) may be discontinued from that  agent for a period of time before and after the LP at the 
discretion of the PI (or qualified designee). Participan ts who are taking anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin (Coumadin) 
and/or dabigatran (Pradaxa)) may not undergo an LP. 
An MRI or CT prior to LP and LP under fluoroscopy are perm itted, if needed, with approval by [CONTACT_731140] a case-by-case basis.  The participant should be appropriately consented prior to the additional procedure 
according to local site requirements.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_998676] 1-2 mL (or more if needed) of CSF should be disca rded.  1-2 mL CSF (or volume per local laboratory 
requirements) will be sent to the local laboratory for protein, glucose, and cell counts. Remaining CSF will be 
frozen on dry ice or in a -80 freezer and shipped overnight  frozen to the ATRI Laboratory and Biorepository for 
processing and analysis.  Analyses will include AD biomarke rs (e.g. Aβ and tau, exploratory biomarkers).  Amyloid 
CSF results will be generated centrally using quantitative me trics to assess level of amyloidosis, and eligibility 
information for continuing in the TRC cohort will be returned to site. 
Each study participant or a person designated to speak fo r them will be contact[CONTACT_3012] 72 hours after the LP 
to confirm participant well-being and to query about any adverse events. 
CSF samples will be shipped to the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) Laboratory and Biorepository

receive the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_511080] a country-specifi c law or regulation that requires notification of the 
results. The samples will be coded with the participant number and stored indefinitely for future analyses. The 
samples and any data generated from them can only be linked back to the participant by [CONTACT_454872].  
Whole blood samples will be shipped to the Alzheime r’s Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) Laboratory and 
Biorepository at the University of Southern [LOCATION_004] (USC ) for extraction of genomic and plasma samples. At sites 
where the capabilities exist, additional blood will be collected  and processed locally for plasma, then shipped to 
the ATRI Laboratory and Biorepository.  Genomic and biomar ker analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_731142]. 
Plasma concentrations of Aβ species and tau will be determined from processed blood samples using either 
validated or research grade immunoassay and/or mass spectrometry methods.  Analysis of Aβ species and tau is 
intended to understand these plasma-based biomarkers as  compared to other clinical, cognitive, and imaging 
measures. Other sources of Aβ species, including plasma  exosome-based amyloids thought to be associated with 
amyloid accumulation may also be analyzed. Our goal is to determine the optimal pre-processing pathway and 
analytical approach to measurement of plasma Aβ rati os to reduce negative amyloid PET scans and LP studies. 
Banked plasma specimens may also be used for other emer ging biomarkers that may become available, including 
measures of Neurofilament Light chain (NfL), and specific tau fragments.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   18 8.3.1  SAMPLES FOR BIOMARKER STORAGE AND FUTURE RESEARCH  
Collection of biomarker samples for long-term storage and futu re research is also part of this study.  Plasma, whole 
blood, and CSF samples will be shipped to the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute (ATRI) Laboratory and 
Biorepository at the University of Southern [LOCATION_004] (USC ) for long-term storage and future research.  Sample 
collection, handling, and shipment will occur according to the procedures described in the relevant ATRI Biomarker 
Procedures Manual. Analysis may be conducted on possible nove l biomarkers  to evaluate their association with 
clinical outcomes. Analysis of these data could provide an important biomarker that would guide future decisions 
by [CONTACT_511136]. The stored samples will be  coded with the participant number and stored indefinitely 
for future research.  The samples and any data generated  from them can only be linked back to the participant by 
[CONTACT_389785].  Because of the exploratory nature of these analyses and because the results should 
not change medical management, neither participants nor investigators will receive the test results. 
8.4 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
 
8.4.1  CONCOMITANT MEDICATION REVIEW  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed at every visit as indicated in SOA (section 1.3).  
8.4.2  CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSESSMENTS  
Clinical labs will be performed centrally as indicated in  SOA (section 1.3) and will consist of Hematology, Chemistry 
Panel, TSH, Vitamin B12, and urinalysis.  Lab reports w ill be reviewed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_362557] (or a medically-qualified individual delegated by [CONTACT_978]).  If a value is outside of the laboratory’s 
normal range, the clinician will indicate if it is clinically significant or not.  Those results that are deemed clinically 
significant may need to be repeated and follow up with t he participant’s primary care physician for further 
evaluation should occur. 
If a participant is having lumbar puncture, a coagulation panel and platelet count will be obtained either locally or 
centrally prior to the LP (within 3 months),  in order to rule out a clotting disorder.  
If a female is not surgically sterile or post-menopausal by [CONTACT_193957], a pregnancy test will be performed locally at 
the site prior to conducting the PET scan. Participants with  positive pregnancy test will be ineligible for amyloid PET 
imaging. 
8.5 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
8.5.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medica l occurrence.  Adverse events deemed related to the 
study compounds (e.g. PET tracers) or procedures by [CONTACT_731143] 2 days of PET tracer administration, regardle ss of causality, will be tracked during the study.  
The following events are considered adverse events: 
(1) worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions or symptoms present at the start of 
the study 
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   19 (2) participant deterioration due to primary illness 
(3) intercurrent illness  
(4) drug interaction  
Abnormal laboratory and imaging findings will only be reported as an AE if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_731117]. 
The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and or other 
clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis shoul d be documented as the AE and not the individual signs or 
symptoms.  Symptoms and conditions present at the beginning of the study will be characterized, so that AEs can 
be defined as any new symptom, or any increase in fre quency or severity of an existing symptom. Adverse events 
should be described with medical terminology so that  the event can be matched against a medical coding 
dictionary, such as Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Investigators should report their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to the protocol compounds 
and procedures.  Following questioning and evaluation, onl y AEs, determined to be related to the protocol 
compounds or procedures by a medically qualified Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_731118] [ADDRESS_998678] be documented in the participant’s 
records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the AE eCRF. 
8.5.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
1. Death 
2. A life-threatening adverse event 
3. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_061] (see below for more information 
regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
4. A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions 
5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring inte nsive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458986]: 
• Admission for treatment of a pre-existing condition that  is not associated with the development of a new 
AE or with a worsening of the pre-existing conditi on (i.e., work-up for persistent lab abnormality that 
occurred prior to the study) 
• Social admission (i.e., participant has no place to sleep) 
• Administrative admission (i.e., yearly physical exam) 
• Protocol-specified admission (i.e., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_4690]) 
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   20 • Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (i.e., pre-planned treatments, elective 
cosmetic surgery) 
For more detail, refer to the Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 312: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=312.32  
8.5.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT (AE) 
Reporting standards for reporting AEs will be provided in the relevant procedures manual and must be followed 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_412116] a protocol defined grading system. The  following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not in terfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. 
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the 
term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY COMPOUNDS OR PROCEDURES 
The investigator or designated, licensed clinician is respons ible for determining whether or not an event is related 
to study compounds (e.g. PET radiotracer), specific study procedures or “other study procedure(s)”. “Other study 
procedure(s)” refers to any other procedure outside of thos e specified that may have a causal relationship to the 
AE. 
• Definitely Related  – The event is clearly related to a study compound or procedure. There is clear 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship. The influence of other factors can be ruled out. 
• Probably Related  – The event is likely related to a study compound or procedure. There is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship, such as reasonable te mporal sequence. The influence of other factors is 
unlikely. Suggest a causal relationship. The influence of other factors can be ruled out. 
• Possibly Related  – suggest a causal relationship. The influence of other factors can be ruled out. 
• Unlikely Related  – A poor temporal relationship exists between the event onset and study compound or 
procedure. The event could easily be explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
• Not Related  - There is no evidence of a causal relationship and a causal relationship cannot be reasonably 
attributed to the study compound or procedures. The event is clearly due to extraneous causes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the IB, package insert, or 
device labeling or is not listed at the specificity or severi ty that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk inform ation described in the protocol, as amended.

Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   21 8.5.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 
Adverse events will be reported from the time of signing t he TRC informed consent until signing an ICF for a clinical 
trial, and will resume following completion of the trial and reactivation in TRC.  
Following up on AEs:  The investigator is obliged to follo w participants with AEs until the events have resolved, the 
conditions are considered medically stable, or the partici pants are no longer available for follow up. Participants 
who discontinue due to adverse experiences will be treated and followed according to established medical 
practice. All pertinent information will be entered into the eCRF. 
8.5.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Adverse events deemed related to the study compounds (e.g. PET tracers) or procedures by [CONTACT_7910] [INVESTIGATOR_731119]. The principal investigators and A TRI staff will monitor the study procedures for this study

Medical Monitor and the data safety monitoring board (DSM B)) will evaluate each serious adverse event for safety 
and causality and will determine whether the adverse event a ffects the risk/benefit ratio of the study and whether 
modifications to the protocol or consent form are required. 
8.5.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Serious adverse events deemed related to the study compounds  (e.g. PET tracers) or procedures by [CONTACT_7910] [INVESTIGATOR_731120] 2 days of PET tracer administration, regardl ess of causality, will be tracked during the study.  Any 
serious adverse event meeting either requirement whi ch occurs during the course of the investigation (i.e. any 
time after informed consent) or within [ADDRESS_998679] be reported to the Medical Monitor at ATRI 
within 24 hours of learning of the event.  ATRI Medical  Safety team will generate an SAE report, which will be 
distributed to all participating sites and to the central IRB.    
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until sati sfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems 
the event to be chronic or the participant is stabl e. Other supporting documentation of the event may be 
requested by [CONTACT_731144]’s Medical Safety group and should be provided as soon as possible.

8.5.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
Pregnancy is not an adverse event, but some studies will require unique considerations if pregnancy was to occur 
during the study. A participant who is enrolled in the TRC cohort who becomes pregnant can continue in the 
cohort but eligibility for enrollment in to a preclinical /prodromal AD trial will occur once pregnancy (and any 
interval of breast feeding) are complete.

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   22 8.6 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
 
8.6.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections considers unant icipated problems involving risks to participants or 
others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or  outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or out come may have been caused by [CONTACT_226592]).   
• Suggests that the research places participants or ot hers at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) t han was previously known or recognized. 
ATRI Coordinating Center staff will monitor the unanticipat ed problems for overall safety and scientific relevance 
on an ongoing basis and provide information to the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
8.6.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to 
the Coordinating Center via the AE eCRF. The UP report will include the following information: 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol titl e and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that t he event, incident, experience, or outcome represents 
an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are 
proposed in response to the UP. 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the Coordinating Center 
within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported by [CONTACT_731145] (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), upon receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.  
8.6.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be informed by [CONTACT_731146].  
8.7 GLOBAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIER 
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   23 A Global Unique identifier (GUID) wi ll be generated for each participant if permissible based on local and regional 
laws/requirements. A GUID provides a method to link colle ctions of research data and specimens, balancing the 
competing goals of distinguishing individuals, colle cting accurate information for matching, and protecting 
confidentiality. Certain personal identifying information (PII)  is collected by [CONTACT_731147], which will then be recorded in the CR F.  The PII fields employed in this approach are invariant 
over the lifetime of the subject. This approach has proven to adequately discriminate i ndividuals in both simulation 
and field studies (Johnson et al., 2010).  Software will be provided to sites to generate the GUID using a standard 
algorithm so that the PII itself will not be submitted or stored centrally.  
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical analyses will be based on a pre-specified sta tistical analysis plan (SAP). This plan will be informed by 
[CONTACT_731148]-way during the study to id entify the presence of potential sources of bias, 
including but not limited to the distribution and nature of the data, confounding effects, and amount and type of 
missing data.  Each metric of interest will be initially assessed descriptively. For categorical data, we will use rates 
as the outcome measures, excluding the missing and unknown cases. For continuous data, parametric (one-sample 
t-test), non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed rank test) or resampling approaches (bootstrap or jackknife techniques) 
will be used, as appropriate. Comparisons between metrics  from recent, current-technology trials and the TRC-PAD 
metrics will be made using 95% confidence intervals. A p-value of 0.[ADDRESS_998681], t-
tests, chi-square tests or resampling techniques will be used, as appropriate for the type (continuous, categorical) 
and distribution (normal, non-normal) of the data. Regressi on models (generalized linear models or generalized 
linear mixed models), as appropriate, will be used to examine associations of covariates of interest with the TRC-
PAD metrics. 
All statistical analyses will be conducted at the end of the gr ant cycle with all available data at the point of data 
cut-off date. Due to the exploratory nature of these ai ms, no adjustments will be made  for multiple comparisons. 
However, data will be reported as point estimates and confidence intervals to provide the magnitude and 
variability around each of the estimates. All analyses will utilize R ( www.r-project.org ). 
Statistical Aim 1: This approach will markedly accelerate recru itment timelines, shorten time to site activation for 
trials, and reduce unexplained variance in cognitive testing. 
Analysis Plan: The use of adaptive approaches to participant selection, data capture and data monitoring will 
continually optimize the approach. At the end of the five  years, formal tests of hypotheses will be conducted to 
assess the success of the web-based mechanisms by [CONTACT_731149], in particular comparing 
timelines, cost, screen failure rates and the measured change and variance in cognitive scores to those in 
preclinical and prodromal studies for which similar dat a can be obtained. Two-sided, one-sample tests of means 
(recruitment timelines and time to site activation) or  variances (variance in cognitive testing) or corresponding 
resampling techniques will be used to detect differenc es between the TRC-PAD sample and comparator data.  
Power Analysis: Power analyses for these hypotheses were  done using a two-sided, one-sample t-test for means 
and a one-sample test of variance using the software PASS.  A reduction of 10% in mean recruitment timeline, 
mean time to site activation and unexplained variance in cogni tive testing is considered scientifically meaningful.  
While the sample size selected was based on the need fo r a Cohort sufficiently large to support an efficacy trial, we 
have examined the power of this sample to test our hypot heses.  1. A sample size of 2000 participants achieves 
90% power to detect a change as little as 3 days (3%) in recr uitment timelines and time to site activation for trials, 
TRC Version 4.1 
Protocol ATRI-004 22 November 2021 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 07 APR 2017   24 assuming current estimates of 120+/-40 days respectively.  2 Estimates of baseline variability from completed AD 
trials range between 4.5 and 10 points in ADASCog11 score within a site. A sample size of 2000 participants 
achieves 90% power to detect a difference of at least 0.4 points (5% change) in unexplained standard deviation of 
cognitive scores, assuming a type I error rate of 5%.  Thus, there is adequate power to detect very small 
differences and looking at multiple sub-groups of interest would not compromise power. 
Statistical Aim 2: Once optimized, this algorithm will be able to select amyloid positive individuals (and eventually 
tau and other neurodegenerative biomarkers) with >75%  accuracy, greatly reducing future costly biomarker screen 
fails.  
Analysis Plan: Initial amyloid PET results will be compared to historical data from preclinical and prodromal studies 
for which similar data can be obtained and, for prodr omal participants, published data from gantenerumab and 
avagacestat studies.  Standard statistical methods (t-tests for continuous measures and chi-square tests for 
categorical measures) will be used to compare the partici pants identified as biomarker positive and biomarker 
negative. Associations between an indicator of biomarker positivity and each of the potential risk factors will be 
assessed in a two-staged manner using a generalized linear m odel with a logit-link function or a generalized linear 
mixed model for binary data (to account for the measuremen ts over time for an individual participant). Univariate 
associations deemed to be statistically significant (p <0. 15) will be included in a mult ivariable logistic regression 
model. Potential confounding and effect-modifying variables will be included in the model as covariates, if 
necessary. The risk factors and the appropriate functional form  of these factors that will be utilized in the model 
will be clearly stated in the SAP and will be based on th e results of the preliminary analysis. An individual 
participant’s predicted risk of biomarker positivity will be calculated using the final mu ltivariable risk prediction 
model and serve as a risk-algorithm.  The performance of this model will be assessed using four measures: the 
concordance index (c-index) to evaluate the discrimination abilit y, the calibration slope and calibration in the large 
to evaluate the model calibration, and decision-curve analys is to assess clinical usefulness. The model will be 
internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation and bootstrap sampling.   
Power Analysis: Power analysis was done using a comparison of the area under a ROC curve (AUC) with a null 
hypothesis value of 0.75. Assuming a total sample size of 2000 participants and a 60% amyloid expected positivity 
rate, we have 90% power to detect an AUC of at least 0. [ADDRESS_998682] and a level of significance of 
5%. 
Statistical Aim 3:  Baseline and longitudinal cognitive performance, (i ncluding lack of practice effect on repeated 
web-based cognitive tests), decline on performance based  functional measures, and a combination of self- and 
study-partner report will predict and subsequently tr ack with in-person measures of cognitive (PACC) and 
functional (CDR-SB) decline.  
Analysis Plan: To assess the associations between web- based cognitive tests and in-person measures, linear mixed 
models will be used to accommodate the dependencies of  scores over the follow-up time period. Such models 
accommodate different times of measurement, time varyin g and time invariant covariates as well as missed 
measurements and data from participants who are lost to follow-up. Permutation tests may be implemented to 
verify that valid p-values will be obtained ev en if model assumptions are not correct.  
Power Analysis: Assuming a correlation coefficient of 0. [ADDRESS_998683] 
90% power to observe a correlation as low as 0.67 with a sample size of 1000 participants and a type I error rate of 
5%. Hence, the sample size will have adequate power to de tect clinically meaningful associations between the 
web-based and in-person measures of decline.

10.1.13  DATA AND COORDINATING CENTER 
The USC Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Center (ATRI) will serve as the Data and Coordinating Center. No 
human subjects will be enrolled at USC ATRI. Under the direction of [CONTACT_731160], ATRI will provide 
comprehensive data management, clinical operations, clinical monitoring and regulatory oversight for this study.  
All user and study data are stored and maintained on servers hosted on Amazon Web Services under an Enterprise 
Agreement with USC which stipulates rights and re sponsibilities between both parties. AWS implements 
sophisticated technical and physical controls designed to prevent  unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer 
content which have been independently validated to meet or exceed ISO [ZIP_CODE] (Information technology --Security 
techniques --Code of practice for protection of personally i dentifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII 
processors).  
All communication to and from the data system is encr ypted. All user and study data transmissions occur through a 
secure internet connection-HTTPS over TLS 1.0 and higher (Hypertext Transfer Protocol within a connection 
encrypted by [CONTACT_731157]) using secure [ADDRESS_998694] requirements. Users are 
logged out of the system after a period of inactivity.

10.4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT HISTORY 
 
Version Date Overview of Changes  Brief Rationale 
1.0 26NOV2018 Original  
2.0 14MAR2019 Revised screening and baseline procedures, 
including visit schedule, eligibility requirements, and options for use of prior 
testing for eligibility; clarified participant 
status while involved in a clinical trial; adjusted the definition of reportable AEs and SAEs; revised lab collection procedures and added location of central research specimen storage facility; added allowance for LAR to consent; updated information about 
coordinating center and data security; 
updated the name [CONTACT_731159]. 
3.0 15SEP2020 Allowing NAV-4694 tracer; Adding GUID; 
Removing C-SSRS; Removing ECG; Increase Sites to 50; Flexibility on out-of-
window visits and phone visits due to COVID Allowing a new tracer for 
amyloid PET scans for sites. Adding GUID for future linkage of participants in treatment trials, C-SSRS not required for this assessment, removing ECG and COVID disruptions increase need for out-of-window flexibility 
4.0 14SEP2021 Typos and Formatting throughout 
document; Exclusion Criteria #1 was 
modified to include aducanumab; Change to screening visit window: Screening Stages [ADDRESS_998695] be completed within a 60-day window and Screening stage 3 
should be completed within 84 days of 
the start of screening activities This will allow for central 
authorization to review blood plasma analysis

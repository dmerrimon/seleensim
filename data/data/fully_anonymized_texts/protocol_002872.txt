Number of Planned Patients   
48 patients  
Length of Study   
 2 years  
Primary Objective  
• To assess progression -free survival (PFS) time, defined as the time to disease 
progression or death, whichever occurs first, starting when crenolanib administration is 
begun.  
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To assess disease -free surviv al (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) tim e, graft -versus -host 
disease, and [ADDRESS_145416] 
remission is of limited effectiveness to improving outcomes due to persistent relapse risks.  
Crenolanib i s a FLT3 targeted TKI that has preliminary clinical activity as a salvage therapy 
in a heavily pretreated AML population with FLT3 ITD, FLT3 D83 5, and compound FLT3 
ITD/D835 mutations including those with resistance after prior TKI therapy.  Given the 
favorable safety profile of crenolanib and promising clinical benefit in AML patients, a trial 
examining the role of crenolanib as maintenance in th e post -transplant setting is warranted.  
 
Crenolanib besylate is an orally bioavailable benzimidazole  that was designed to be a 
selective and potent inhibitor of  the class III receptor kinase FLT3. Molecular binding data 
support that crenolanib is a type I  kinase inhibitor that binds preferentially to the active 
kinase conformation of FLT3. As a result of this property, crenolanib potently inhibits both 
wild type and constitutively active mutant FLT3 kinase. Specifically, in 51 patients with 
relapsed/refrac tory FLT3 ITD and/or TKD mutant AML including relapse following 
multiple lines of therapy including  prior  TKIs, crenolanib was well tolerated and 
demonstrated an overall clinical benefit of 55% including complete remission ( CR), 
incomplete hematological re covery ( CRi), and partial remission ( PR).  Six of [ADDRESS_145417] with

Preliminaries  
This is a single -arm, Phase II study of crenolanib in allogeneic stem cell transplant in 
patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR after allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation . Administration of crenolanib is oral, and will be started at some time 
between [ADDRESS_145427] -transplant, and then given every day for up to two years .  There 
are two patient subgroups: 1) those that were in complete remission (CR) at the time of 
transplant, and 2) those that were not in complete remission (NCR) at the time of tran splant.  
The primary outcome is progression -free survival (PFS) time, defined as the time to disease 
progression or death, whichever occurs first, starting when crenolanib administration is 
begun.  A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in each subgroup . 
 
Futility Monitoring  
PFS time will be monitored separately within each of the two subgroups, using the Bayesian 
method of Thall et al. [1].  Denote standard therapy by S and the experimental crenolanib 
therapy by E.  Assume that TS = PFS time with S foll ows an exponential distribution with 
median mS and that TE = PFS time with E in the each subgroup follows an exponential 
distribution with median mE.  Denote the median PFS times for the standard and 
experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_128865], respectively.  Unde r a Bayesian model, both mS and 
mE are assumed to follow Inverse Gamma(a, b) priors.  
 
Secondary outcomes and data analyses.  
Secondary outcomes will include disease -free survival (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) 
time, graft -versus -host disease, and 100 -day transplant -related mortality.  Within each 
subgroup, CR and no CR, these events will be tabulated and the distributions of DFS and 
OS time estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier [2].

 2.  BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
2.1  Introduction  
 
Allogeneic  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is offered to eli gible patients with 
suitable donor to increase long term survival in patients with FLT3 positive acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML). However, disease relapse due to presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) 
remains a key reason of treatment failure in post-transplant  patients [1]. Furthermore, a recent 
study showed that the presence of internal tandem duplication of FLT3 gene (FLT3 -ITD) 
correlated with a higher risk of relapse and lower leukemia free survival  (LFS) after allogenei c 
HSCT performed in first CR (Figure 1.1).

Presence and absence of FLT3 -ITD is denoted by [CONTACT_128909], respectively.  
(A) Estimated probability of 2 years of cumulative incidence of relapse; (B) leukemia -free 
survival after transplantation at 2 years.  
 
The m ajority of relapses occur within 8 months after transplant [3] and m ost patients who relapse 
after allogeneic HSCT do not achieve long -term survival with available salvage treatment  
modalities including second HSCT. Prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) has b een 
used to prevent relapse of AML in  the post-transplant setting; however, it is often associated with 
life-threatening G VHD [4]. Therefore, it is critical to develop a novel agent which  can be given 
when minimal MRD is present, is tolerable , has activity  against the disease , and can be given 
early after transplant.  
2.2  Crenolanib inhibits wild -type FLT3 and constitutively active mutations  
 
Crenolanib, a FMS like tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is well tolerated in relapsed/refractory 
FLT3 mutant positive AML patients after allogeneic HSCT and may present a novel pathway to 
prevent relapse .

 Crenolanib besylate (also known as CP -868,596 -26) is an orally bioavailable class III RTK 
inhibitor that potently targets FLT3. Crenolanib inhibits wild -type FLT3 and its constitutively 
active mutations at clinically achievable concentrations. [5, 6]   
 
Crenolanib has heightened binding affinity against the FLT3 -ITD mutation (the most frequent 
FLT3 aberration in AML) and TKD point mutations FLT3 (D835H), FLT3 (D835Y) and FLT3 
(D835V). Cre nolanib binds to FLT3 -ITD and F T3-TKD D835H with Kd values of 0.43 and 0.4 
nM, respectively. Similarly, crenolanib also binds to FLT 3-TKD D835Y with a Kd of 0.18 nM. A 
saturation mutagenesis screen of FLT3 ITD showed that crenolanib is a “pan -FLT3 inhibitor” that 
has the ability to successfully suppress all resistance -conferring TKD mutants [5]. Crenolanib 
inhibitory activity has been verified  in human AML cell lines. [5]

Crenolanib has reduced activity against KIT  
Crenolanib has been found to be approximately [ADDRESS_145431] FLT3 relative to KIT [8] and elicits cytotoxicity in FLT3 –
mutant AML while largely sparing KIT inhibition ([ADDRESS_145432] -transplant AML patients                                    November 6, 2018

associated with less myelosuppression than the other  FLT3 TKIs.   
2.3 Clinical Studies of Crenolanib in AML  
 
2.3.1 Clinical Summary of Crenolanib in Relapsed/Refractory FLT3 mutated AML  
Crenolanib has been studied in relapsed/refractory FLT3 mutant AML ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). As of July 30, 2014, a total of [ADDRESS_145433] been treated with single -
agent crenolanib. Patients had received a median number of 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_128866] L (range 1 -
7) including prior transplant and TKI therapy.  
 
Of the 51 AML patients (FLT3 ITD, or FLT3 D835, or FLT3 ITD/D835) treated with crenolanib, 
[ADDRESS_145434] clearance after crenolanib 
therapy (Figure 5.5). Twenty -seven ( 27) patients have demonstrated response, including 1 
complete remission (CR) with full count recovery, 8 CR with incomplete hematological recovery 
(CRi), 7 partial remissions (PR) and [ADDRESS_145435] responses. Clinical benefit rate was 55 %. Five  (11 
%) of these heavily pre -treated patients were bridged to transplant. Of the [ADDRESS_145436] gained cli nical benefit (56 %): 6 CR/ CRi (24%), 4 PR (16 %), and [ADDRESS_145437] response (16 %)  [9, 10] .

 elevations (8 -11 %). Two patients went off study due to toxicities, one due to nausea / vomiting 
and one due to fatigue. Dose reduction occurred in [ADDRESS_145440] patients had received concomitant medication including antifungal medicine 
throughout crenolanib therapy ; nonetheless no QT prolongation has been observed.  
 
In conclusion, crenolanib is a FLT3 TKI that has showing preliminary clinical activity in a heavily 
pretreated  AML  population with FLT3 -ITD, FLT3 -D835, and compound FLT3 -ITD/D835 mutant 
disease . Importantly, crenolanib is the first agent to demonstrate clinical activity in patients with 
FLT3 -D835 activating mutations.  
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_145441] Undergone Prior Allogeneic 
Bone Marrow Transplant  
 
Within the 51 AML pat ients treated with single agent crenolanib , a total of thirteen patients (6M, 
7F) had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplants .   Seven patients received crenolanib  at 
a dose of 100  mg TID (total daily dose of 300  mg). Six patients received a highe r total daily dose 
of 200mg/m2/day given in three divided doses.  
 
The median age of the se patients was of 55 years (37 -76). The median duration between 
allogeneic HSCT and initiation of crenolanib therapy was 249 days (34 -1313).  Nine patients had 
progress ed after prior FLT3 TKI exposure (7  patients had had prior treatment with sorafenib , 4 
with midostaurin , 3 with quizartinib, and one  with PLX3397).    
 
Overall,  a similar rate  and spectrum  of toxicities were observed when crenolanib was 
administered at either dose level to the se [ADDRESS_145442] common adverse events were 
gastrointestinal (nausea (31%), vomiting (31%), diarrhea (23%), and constipation (23%)), a nd 
infections (pneumonia (23%), mucositis oral (21%), and fever (15%)).  
 
Three  of the six patients  who received the  higher total dose of 200mg/m2/day of crenolanib  
require d dose reduction due to toxicities :  one patient for periorbital edema, o ne patient for 
neutropenia, and another patient for elevated bilirubin. Th is latter patient was found to have 
reactivation of GVHD  on liver biopsy  as major causative factor causing elevated bilirubin . The 
patient with neutropenia recovered his neutrophil counts after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128867]. The 
patient with periorbital edema was able to resume crenolanib without recurrence of the edema.  
All seven patients treated with the [ADDRESS_145443] -transplant AML patients                                    November 6, 2018

STUDY THERAPY  
6.3 Crenolanib Maintenance Therapy  
  
Generally, p atients will be treated according to the following:   
• Maintenance therapy with crenolanib is intended in all patients in CR/CRi after allogeneic 
HSCT.  
• Start of maintenance crenolanib therapy is intended at the earliest time no sooner than [ADDRESS_145469].  
• Prerequisites  for start of maintenance are hematological recovery with  neutrophils >1.0 x 
109/L, all non -hematological toxicities have to be below CTC AE grade 2, GVHD ≤ Grade 1, 
either no signs of chronic GVHD or mild chronic GVHD graded as limited disease.  
• Maintenance therapy will be given for up to 728 days. (up to 26 cycles where 1 cycle of therapy 
is defined as 28 consecutive days regardless of whether study drug is taken or not) after 
recovery from allogeneic HSCT as long as the  patient does  not develop disease progression 
while on crenolanib therapy . 
• Patients should take their doses at approximately the same time each day, and approximately

 or 30 minutes after foo d with a glass of water (no juice) (~240 ml).  Patients should be 
instructed to swallow the tablets whole and not to chew them.  
• Maintenance therapy with crenolanib will be given at a dose of [ADDRESS_145471] may receive 100 mg TID.   
• Dose reduction guidelines for adverse events are listed in Table 7.1 and 7.2 in Section 7.1.  
Dose reductions beyond those mentioned in these tables or different than those specified, 
should be discussed with the Sponsor and documentation of the justification recorded.  
• Antiemetics per ASCO guidelines for moderately emetogen ic therapy should be instituted. 
Reduction in antiemetic support can be individualized as appropriate.  
• If a dose is missed or vomited, it should not be taken again.  The next dose should not be 
increased to account for missing a dose.  The patient should n ote the missed dose  in the patient 
diary  and take the next regular dose at the regularly scheduled time.  
• Subsequent cycles may be delayed for recovery of toxicity .  Delays in start of subsequent 
cycles greater than 8 weeks will be acceptable only after de termination of the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_128870]/benefit ratio.  
• For patients who discontinue therapy, the reason for treatment discontinuation will be captured.  
6.4 Duration of Therapy  
Treatment may continue for 728 days until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
1. progressive disease defined as:  
1.[ADDRESS_145472] AML  
1.3 Relapse defined as detection of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood OR > 5% blasts in 
marrow not attributed to another cause.   
2. Intercurrent illness that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_128871], or  
3. Patient request, or  
4. General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patien t unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator, or  
5. Unacceptable toxicity that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_128872], or  
 
It is planned that up to a total of 728 days of therapy will be administered  for patients deriving 
benefit from this regimen.  
 
A minimum of 1 full course (defined as the administration of crenolanib for 28 days) will be 
required for a patient to be considered as having received an adequate trial to evaluate efficacy. 
Only those p atients who failed to  complete  at least  one cycle  (28 consecutive days)  of crenolanib 
therapy , unless they progressed or dropped out due to toxicity  will be replaced. All patients 
receiving at least one dose of study drug will be considered evaluable for t oxicity.

 10.  CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE MAINTENANCE  
Response criteria will be modified from the International Working Group for AML (34). Patients 
on this trial should be in CR, CRi, or PR following allogeneic SCT with evidence of donor 
engraftment documented per institutional standard.  Briefly, CR criteria and definition of 
progression are as follows:  
 
Complete Remission (CR):  
• Peripheral blood counts:  
 No circulating blasts  
 Neutrophil count ≥1.0 x109/L  
 Platelet count ≥100 x109/L 
 
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]:  
 ≤5% blasts  
 No Auer rods  
 No extramedullary leukemia  
 
Complete Remission with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi) : 
• Peripheral blood counts:  
 No circulating blasts  
 Neutroph il count <1.0 x109/L, or  
 Platelet count <100 x109/L 
 
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]:  
 ≤ 5% blasts  
 No Auer rods  
 No extramedullary leukemia  
 
Partial Remission (PR) :  
• All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment  except:  
50 % reduction in bone marrow blast but still >5% or  
 Marrow blasts <5% with persistent Auer rods  
 
Progressive Disease : 
• death due to any cause  
• start of non -protocol therapy directed for AML  
• relapse as defined as  
o circulating blasts in peripheral blood  
o >5% blasts in marrow not attributable to any other cause  
 
Progression  Free Survival will be assessed in two ways : Time to disease progression or death, 
whichever occurs first, starting when crenolanib administration is begun and when stem cell 
infusion was performed (Day 0) .  BMA will be scheduled at the following time points:  On day 100  
± 10, 6th month ± [ADDRESS_145486] year ± 1 month and 2 years ± [ADDRESS_145487] a causal relationship with  study  
treatment.  
 
Adverse drug reaction is a response to a drug which is noxious and unintended and which occurs 
at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease or for the 
modification of physiologic function.  
 
Assessing c ausal connections between agents and disease is fundamental to the understanding of 
adverse drug reactions. In general, a drug may be considered a contributory cause of an adverse 
event if, had the drug not been administered, 1) the event would not have ha ppened at all, 2) the 
event would have occurred later than it actually did, or 3) the event would have been less severe.  
 
Adverse Events (AEs) will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03 and 
documented in the case report form (CRF). After the Informed Consent Form  is signed, study 
site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s pre -existing conditions, 
including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease. During the study, site 
personnel will record any change in the pre -existin g condition(s) and the occurrence and nature 
of any new adverse events. All adverse events  of grade 3, grade 4, or grade [ADDRESS_145488]-transplant  are:    
 
1) Febrile or infection epi[INVESTIGATOR_128882]  
2) Preexisting side effects related to prior disease specific therapy  including GVHD related 
symptoms  (Sinusoidal Obstruction Syn drome (SOS), rash etc.)  or ongoing medications 
for management of non -leukemia conditions  (Diarrhea, mucositis etc.)  
3) Myelosuppresion and myelosuppression -related events  
4) Bone, joint, or muscle pain  
5) Fatigue/malaise  
6) Weakness  
7) Alopecia  
General Therapy Related Events : 
 
1). Catheter related events (thrombosis, bleeding, infection)  
2). Rash related to antibiotic use or GVHD  
3). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128883] -[ADDRESS_145489] -transplant AML patients                                    November 6, 2018

 Reporting Hematology and Blood Chemistry Results:  
 
• Data captured in addition to the protocol specified scheduled visit is to be reported on 
CRFs ; this includes grade [ADDRESS_145490] 
on do sing or associated signs and sym ptoms  
• Transfusion information is to be captured throughout the study . 
 
Adverse Event Reporting in 30 -day Follow -up Period:  
• Adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until [ADDRESS_145491] dose of study drug  or until start of new study drug .  
• If the patient  with active AE  goes on to another clinical study or standard therapy  within 
the [ADDRESS_145492] -discontinuation follow up , active adverse events  should continue to be 
captured  until resolution  for minimum  of 30 days, if possible .  Data should  includ e name 
[CONTACT_128941].  
• Patients who do not have progressive disease but stop crenolanib for toxicity should be 
followed until resolution of toxicity.  
• Patients who have progressive disease and do not receive further therapy do not need to 
be followed, unless there is toxicity rela ted to study drug which is unresolved at the time 
patient is taken off study  
11.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, in 
the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it 
occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it oc curred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity – a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life functions . 
• A pregnancy or  congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that do not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency roo m or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32).  
 
Any important medical event may be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_39725] l 
Investigator and the IND Sponsor.    
 
Protocol ARO -[ADDRESS_145493] of a protocol will be reported (either via 
expedited report or log) to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures.    
 
All serious adverse events will be recorded in the case report form.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128884] (previously described) 
will not have an expedited report but it will be included in the annual report via the SAE log.  
 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, expected or unexpected, and regardless of attribution to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of 
knowledge of the event to AROG.   
• The institution’s Internal SAE Rep ort Form for Prompt Reporting will be used for reporting to 
AROG.  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time the patient signs consent until [ADDRESS_145494] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, 
or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse event s that occur after the [ADDRESS_145495] be reported to IRB and to AROG. This may 
include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
11.3 Reporting of a Serious Adverse Event to FDA  
Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (AROG ) according to 21 
CFR 312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_128885], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, 
the sponsor’s guidelines,  and Institutional Review Board policy.  
 
12.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Preliminaries  
This is a single -arm, Phase II study of crenolanib in allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in CR after  allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Administration 
of crenolanib is oral, and will be started at some time between [ADDRESS_145496] -transplant, and 
then given every day for up to two years .  There are two patient subgroups: 1) those that were in 
comp lete remission (CR) at the time of transplant, and 2) those that were not in complete remission 
(NCR) at the time of transplant.  The primary outcome is progression -free survival (PFS) time, 
defined as the time to disease progression or death, whichever oc curs first, starting when 
crenolanib administration is begun.  A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled in each subgroup.  
12.2 Futility Monitoring  
PFS time will be monitored separately within each of the two subgroups, using the Bayesian 
method of Thall  et al. [1].  Denote standard therapy by S and the experimental crenolanib therapy 
by E.  Assume that TS = PFS time with S follows an exponential distribution with median mS and 
Protocol ARO -[ADDRESS_145497] -transplant AML patients                                    November 6, 2018

 that TE = PFS time with E in the each subgroup follows an exponential distribu tion with median 
mE.  Denote the median PFS times for the standard and experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_128865], 
respectively.  Under a Bayesian model, both mS and mE are assumed to follow Inverse Gamma(a, 
b) priors.   
 
12.2.1 Futility Monitoring f or the CR Subgroup  
From historical experience, it will be assumed that Prob(TS > 12 months) = 0.67, which implies 
that the median PFS is 20.77 months. Assume that mS follows an Inverse Gamma (28.96,  
580.77 ) prior, which has a mean of 20.77 and a variance of 16, and that mE follows an Inverse 
Gamma (3, 41.54) prior, which has the same mean of 20.77 months but a much higher variance 
of 431.5.  The possibly right -censored times TE will be monitored continuousl y throughout the 
trial.   Accrual into the CR subgroup will be terminated due to futility at any time if  Prob  (mS < 
mE | data) < 0.0785.  The operating characteristics of this monitoring rule were developed using 
the program TTEDesigner version 1.2.2, ava ilable from the MDACC Department of 
Biostatistics, assuming an accrual rate of 1 patient per month.  The operating characteristics 
(OCs) OCs for the CR subgroup rule are summarized in the Table 1.

12.2.2 Futility Monitoring f or the no CR Subgroup  
For the NCR subgroup, under the Bayesian model, mS and mE follow Inverse Gamma(a, b) 
priors.  From historical experience, it is assumed that Prob(TS > 12 months) = 0.21, which 
implies that the median is 5.33 months.  Assum e that mS follows an Inverse Gamma (14.63, 
72.63) prior, which has a mean of 5.33 and a variance of 2.25, and that mE follows an Inverse 
Gamma (3, 10.66) prior, which has the same mean of 5.33 months but a much higher variance of 
28.4 months. Possibly righ t-censored TE will be monitored continuously throughout the trial. 
Accrual into the NCR subgroup will be terminated is at any time if Prob(mS < mE | data) < 
0.0795.  The OCs of this monitoring rule were developed using the program TTEDesigner v.

12.3 Secondary outcomes and data analyses   
Secondary outcomes will include disease -free survival (DFS) time, overall survival (OS) time, 
graft -versus -host disease, and 100 -day transplant -related mortality.  Within each subgroup, CR 
and no CR, these events will be tabulated and the distributions of DFS and OS time estimated 
using the method of Kaplan and Meier [2].  
12.[ADDRESS_145500] Disposition  
A summary of patient disposition will be provided for each cohort and will include the following:  
• Number of patients enrolled  
• Number of patients who participate in each study phase (induction, consolidation, 
maintenance)  
• Reasons for discontinuation from stu dy treatment and follow -up 
• Summary of major protocol violations  
12.[ADDRESS_145501] Characteristics  
Patient characteristics will be reported for each cohort, and will include a summary of the 
following:  
• Demographics  
• Baseline disease characteristics  
• Pre-existing c onditions  
Other characteristics will be summarized as deemed appropriate.  
12.[ADDRESS_145502] is entered (signs 
informed consent), but before the patient receives study drug, will not be recorded on the CRF 
unless the investigator believes that the events may have b een caused by a protocol procedure. 
Safety analyses will include summaries of the incidence of adverse events by [CONTACT_128918] (version 4.03; NCI 2010) that occur during the study treatment period or within [ADDRESS_145503] dose of study treatment  or until alternate therapy is started, regardless of causality or 
relatedness to study drug. The safety -related outcomes that will be summarized include:  
• Adverse events,  
• TEAEs,  
• SAEs,  
• Deaths,  
• Discontinuations due to adverse events,  
• Extent of exposure to study drug treatment,  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602],  
• Use of key concomitant medications.  
 
Analyses for data with discrete dates (for example, death date and start/stop dates of concomitant 
medications) will be performed through [ADDRESS_145504] be followed until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
12.9 Criteria for End of Study  
This study will be considered complete following the data cut-off date for the final analysis.  
Documentation of the data cut -off will be included in the master study file.  
 
After the final analysis, if subjects are continuing to benefit from study treatment, they may be 
allowed to continue receiving study treatm ent for up to additional one year as part of planned 
maintenance.  
 
Patient is considered “off therapy” when study drug stops for any reason and crenolanib therapy 
is not continued.  
 
Patient is considered “off study” after completion of the [ADDRESS_145505] every 3 months or when more than 20% (more than [ADDRESS_145506] 15 patients enrolled) of the subjects require crenolanib dose reduction 
during t he first 2 cycles of therapy . The study will be halted, and t hese data will  be presented to 
the Sponsor’s safety monitoring team  to decide whether the crenolanib dose should be modified 
for all future patients. Enrollment will be halted if an apparent increase is observed in the 
occurrence of one or more of the following outcomes : 
 
• Early mortality due to any cause  
• Expected, non -hematologic, crenolanib -related toxicity (CTCAE Grade 4)  
• Unexpected, non -hematologic, crenolanib -related toxicity (CTCAE Grade 4)

Protocol ARO -[ADDRESS_145510] be 
approved by [CONTACT_128919]. Amendments significantly affecting the 
safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study, require 
additional approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC/REB of all centers , and, in some countries, by [CONTACT_128920]. A copy of the written approval of the IRB/IEC/REB, which becomes part of the protocol, 
must be given to all the monitors and supporters of the protocol. Examples of amendments 
requiring such approval a re: 
 
1. an increase in drug dosage or duration of exposure of subjects  
2. a significant change in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group)  
3. an increase in the number of invasive procedures to which subjects are exposed  
4. addition or deletion of a test procedure for safety monitoring.  
 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken 
by [CONTACT_128921]. If an 
immediate change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by [CONTACT_128922]/her for safety reasons, the sponsor should be notified and the IRB/IEC/REB at the center 
should be informed within 10 working days or per institutional policy.  
Ame ndments affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB/IEC/REB approval but the IRB/IEC/REB of each center must be kept 
informed of such administrative changes. Examples of administrative changes not req uiring formal 
protocol amendments and IRB/IEC/REB approval that can be treated as administrative 
amendments include:  
 
1. changes in the staff used to monitor trials (e.g. AROG Pharmaceuticals staff versus a CRO)  
2. minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study drug.

Appendi x V. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
Life threatening: “Life threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the adverse event as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would 
result in t he patient’s death. “Life threatening” does not mean that had an adverse event occurred 
in a more severe form it might have caused death (i.e., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic 
failure).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious adverse 
event, although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128895]/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered  adverse 
events if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled on the study, provided that 
it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study.  
 
Important medical event or medical intervention: Medical and scientific judgment sh ould be 
exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in a situation where important medical events may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity but 
may jeopardize the patient or may require medica l intervention to prevent one or more outcomes 
listed in the definition of serious. These should usually be considered as serious.  
 
Examples of such events are:  
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone tre atment  
 Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine  
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
 Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood trans fusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128896]: Any events or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128897] e events.  
 
The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable possibility” 
that an adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  
 Time course of events and exposure to suspect drug: Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug? Did the adverse event occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of suspect drug?  
 Consistency with known drug profile: Was the adverse event consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect dr ug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
Protocol ARO -[ADDRESS_145531] -transplant AML patients                                    November 6, 2018

 pharmacological class? OR could the adverse event be anticipated from its 
pharmacological properties?  
 De-challenge experience: Did the adverse event resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128898] o f the suspect drug?  
 No alternative cause: The adverse event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_128930], such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host, or environmental factors.  
 Re-challenge experience: Did the adverse event reoccur if the  suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? Laboratory tests: Has a specific laboratory 
investigation confirmed the relationship?  
 
A “reasonable possibility” could be considered to exist for an adverse event when [ADDRESS_145532], there would not be a “reasonable possibility” of causality if none of the above criteria 
apply, or if there is evidence of exposure and a reasonable time course, but any de -challenge (if 
performed) is negative or ambiguous, or there is  another more likely cause of the adverse event.  
 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as the following:  
 Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?  
 Is there a known mechanism?  
 
Ambiguous cases should be considered as having  a “reasonable possibility” of causal relationship, 
unless additional evidence becomes available to refute this.  
 
If true progression is determined by [CONTACT_128931], then the date of progression returns to 
the earlier date with increasing mass.

Sampling Collection and Processing Instructions   
 
• At the sampling time point, collect 10 mL of whole blood for each time point in an 
appropriately labeled red/orange -top tube containing thrombin and completely cover with 
aluminum foil to protect from light.  
• The whole blood will remain at room temperature until clotted (approximately 5 
minutes).  
• The serum will be separated from whole blood by [CONTACT_128934] 1500xG for 10 
minutes. Minimize light exposure during this process.  
• Prepare screw -capped  polypropylene collection tubes labeled wit h UPIN, date and time 
of collection.  
• The serum will be transferred to the appropriate tubes and covered with aluminum foil if 
not immediately frozen. Store at -80oC within 1 hour of collection.  
• Samples from each individual patient will be stored and batc hed for that patient. The date 
and time of sample collection, crenolanib dose, and date and time of the last crenolanib 
dose  should be recorded on the appropriate Pharmacokinetics Data Collection Form 
(Forms 1, 2, 3 and 4).

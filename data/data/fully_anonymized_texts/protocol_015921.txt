3. Study Rationale  
3.1.  Using non -technical language, describe the objective of this proposed research including purpose, research  
question, hypothesis,  etc.  From your description, the IRB should be able to determine how this proposed 
study adds to the knowledge on the research topic in order to judge the risks and benefits to the research 
participant s. NOTE : A reference list citing relevant background information must be provided as an 
appendix with this application.  
Childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) is  a pediatric speech sound disorder that may lead to persisting speech 
errors, often despi[INVESTIGATOR_79125]. According to ASHA (2007), CAS is characterized by [CONTACT_79145], achievement of coordinated  transition between speech 
sounds, and coordination of speech sounds (segmental aspects) . Other impairments include difficulty with 
speech  prosody, such as  tone, rhythm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_79126]/or 
context (suprasegmenta l aspects). There are a variety of char acteristics associated with CAS, although the 
presumed challenge is in planning and programming speech movements (ASHA, 2007; Preston, Molfese, et al., 2014).  Such impairments may lead to social, academic, and vocatio nal limitations. Thus, there is a need to 
explore alternate treatment approaches. This study will explore how to improve speech sound production in school -age children with CAS by [CONTACT_79146] a standard speech therapy program. Two adaptations to speech 
thera py will be tested in a [ADDRESS_86520] treatment schedule of 2 one -hour sessions per week vs. a treatment 
sequence beginning with an intensive therapy schedule (10 hrs of treatment in one week), which wi ll then 
transition to a more distributed practice schedule. This treatment modification is intended to minimize erred practice between training sessions in the early stages of learning, then foster generalization through increased time between practice ses sions.  Prior studies suggest that distributing speech therapy sessions in a more 
intense schedule may be beneficial to learning (Namasivayam et al., 2015; Thomas et al., 2014)  
 In Aim 2, we will compare a standard treatment that includes only verbal feedback to the client during speech practice vs. a treatment sequence that initially includes real- time ultrasound visual feedback of the tongue 
during speech, which will be faded over the course of treatment. Ultrasound visual feedback is designed to train articulatory movements. It may enhance children’s understanding of the articulatory goals of speech 
Rev. 08/04/[ADDRESS_86521] shown that speech sound production may be enhanced by [CONTACT_79147]  (Preston, Brick & Landi, 2013; Preston, Leece, McNamara, & Maas, in 
press) , although no prior randomized group studies have been conducted.  
 All 4 of these treatment conditions ( e.g., intensive/distributed, ultrasound visual feedback/no ultrasound visual 
feedback) have been proven effective in treating childhood apraxia of speech; however, no study to date has compared these treatments to see which treatment (or combination of treatments) is most effective.   Beside these modifications, the other aspects of treatment will be held constant. Outcomes will be evaluated by [CONTACT_79148] a large speech sample, scored by [CONTACT_79149]. The four groups will be compared to determine the extent to which speech sound therapy can be enhanced through a treatment sequence that begins with intensive practice and/or with ultrasound visual feedback.  
 
4. Methods  
4.1. Provide a detailed description of what participants will be required to do; including any technical terms  
         or procedures. 
All behavioral testing and treatment will take place at  the Speech Production Laborator y ([ADDRESS_86522]).  
Evaluation Visit 1  (Baseline 1; ~ 2 hrs.)  
Following consent and assent, the following research procedures will be followed  to determine eligibility for the 
study

2011) . ~[ADDRESS_86524] the pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] (from a set of 5 -6) which best completes the pi[INVESTIGATOR_79127]. Inclusionary Criteria: t -Score of 37 or better (- 1.33 SD from the mean).  
3. Goldman -Fristoe Test of Articulation – Third Edition (Goldman & Fristoe, 2015). ~10 minutes. Child is asked 
to name [CONTACT_79171][INVESTIGATOR_79128]. Inclusionary Criteria: Score less than the 
5th percentile.  
4. Peabody Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122] (PPVT -4; Dunn & Dunn, 2007). ~[ADDRESS_86525]. Inclusionary Criteria: Standard Score of 80 or better ( -1.33 
SD from the mean)  
5. Following Directions subtest of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals – 5th Edition (CELF -
P2; Wiig, Semel &  Secord , 2013). ~15 minutes. The examiner gives a direction and the child points to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_79129] (e.g., “Point to the black circle that is to the right of the square.”). 
Complexity of directions increases as children progress through the test. Inclusionary Criteria: Scaled score of 6 or better ( -1.33 SD from the mean).  
*CAS Criteria : to confirm a diagnosis of CAS, participants must meet CAS criteria on 2 of the 3 tasks described 
below:  
6. *Maximum Performance Tasks (Rvachew et al., 2005; adapted from Thoonen et al., 1999). ~20 minutes. Maximum length of phonation duration and fricative duration will be collected. Additionally, alternating motion diadochokinetic rates (MRRmono) (e.g., [p ʌ pʌ pʌ pʌ pʌ pʌ pʌ] and sequential motion 
diadochokinetic rates (MRRtri) (i.e., [pʌ tʌ kʌ pʌ tʌ kʌ pʌ tʌ kʌ] will be collected.  CAS Criteria: Apraxia score 
of 2, Dysarthria score of 0 or 1. Exclusionary criteria: Dysarthria score of 2.  
7. *Syllable repetition task (Shriberg et al 2009). ~5 minutes. Children repeat nonsense syllables that contain 
the sounds / ba ma da  na/ ranging from 2 -4 syllables in length (e.g., /daba/ or  / mabadana /). Number of 
items with additions will be recorded. CAS Criteria: 4 or more additions present out of 18 items . 
Rev. 08/04/16  Page 5 
 8. *Polysyllabic Naming Task (Murray, McCabe, Heard, et al, 2015; adapted from Gozzard et al, 2004). ~15 
minutes. Children will name 80 researcher- selected multisyllabic words presented via pi[INVESTIGATOR_79130] (e.g. , vegetable, umbrella). Children’s productions will be rated for accuracy of lexical 
stress, percent consonants correct, and number of segregated syllables (e.g., um ----brella). 
 
Following the first visit, participants who are eligible will be invited to c ontinue the study.  They must agree to 
be randomized to one of the treatment conditions.  If they agree, they will be randomized (through concealed envelopes) to one of four treatment groups, and scheduling will be discussed.  The second evaluation visit w ill 
be scheduled within one week of the start of treatment.  
 
Evaluation Visit 2  (Baseline 2; ~1.5  hours)  
1. [ADDRESS_86526] of Phonological Processing – Second Edition (Wagner et al., 2013).  ~20 minutes. Subtests include:  Elision (e.g., “Say cowboy. 
Now say it again, but don’t say boy.”), Blending Words (e.g., “What word do these sounds make? /m/ --- /u/ 
--- /n/), and Sound Isolation (e.g., “what is the second sound in toast ?”). Subtest scale d scores, percentiles 
and the Phonological Awareness Composite score, percentile will be obtained.

 Participants will be randomly assigned to either Distributed Practice or Sequenced Distribution (masseddistributed practice). In both conditions, the cumulative treatment dose will be 20 hours of treatment. 
Half of our participants (n=20) will receive treatment following a distributed model of twice per week for 60 minutes 
for 10 weeks, for a total of 20 hrs of therapy. The remaining participants (n=20) will receive treatment following a sequenced approach of massed then  distributed practice, with [ADDRESS_86540] week (2 hrs per day for 5 
days, with a 10 minute break in between sessions each day), then 3 one -hour sessions per week for 2 weeks, and 
finally 2 one -hour sessions per week for 2 weeks.

Aim 2: In addition to the above randomization based on schedule, half of the participants (n=20) will be randomized 
to receive treatment without ultrasound visual feedback and half (n=20) will be randomized to receive treated with 
ultrasound. The practice str ucture described above (see Overview of Treatment Procedures ) will be identical, and the 
difference between conditions therefore will be whether or not the clinician and client have access to a visual 
referent during speech production to describe aspects o f both erred and correct tongue movements.  
 
In the Sequenced Biofeedback No biofeedback condition, participants begin treatment such that ~50% of the 
session includes ultrasound feedback of the tongue. Each session will be divided into four 13 minute Time  Periods 
(A, B, C, D). The ultrasound will be available for practice in Time Periods A and C, whereas practice will continue without ultrasound for periods B and D. When the ultrasound is used in Time Periods A and C, it will be available 
only when the par ticipant is practicing at treatment Levels 1 (syllables), 2 (monosyllabic words), 3 (multisyllabic 
words) and 4 (phrases). However, after 8 hrs of treatment, ultrasound use will be faded such that it is only available 
as children are at practice Levels 1 and 2 to encourage independent practice without visual support at more complex 
levels. During the final 4 hours of treatment, no visual feedback will be available.

 When biofeedback is required, we will use an EchoBlaster 128 ultrasound with PV 6.5 probe to  
provide real- time visual display of the tongue. When it is available, all verbal feedback  by [CONTACT_79150]. For example, when treating / -ks/ 
sequences, feedback can be provided to the client about elevation of the tongue body and 
lowering of the tongue tip for /k/, followed by [CONTACT_79151]/blade for /s/. The 
participant’s attention will therefore be drawn to these movements on the screen and participants will be instructed to  visually monitor their speech movements and make 
corrections based on the visual feedback. As an example, Figure 2  shows ultrasound images 
for /r/ (anterior is right, posterior left). The distorted /r/ (top) has a low tongue tip/blade (right side of the i mage) and high tongue body, whereas the correct /r/ (bottom) has a high 
tongue tip/blade and a lowered tongue body.  
 When no biofeedback is required, practice will be similar to traditional speech therapy. Feedback will be based on the clinician’s percept of the child’s production unaided by [CONTACT_79152]. However, the 
practice and feedback structure will still follow that which is outlined in Table 3.  
 
Overview of Treatment Session Procedures  
A manual is posted on our website outlining  practice  procedures (sp eechproductionlab.syr.edu).  The general 
structure involves a pre -practice stage and a practice stage in each session. During pre -practice , target sound 
sequences (e.g., /lo -/) are elicited through frequent phonetic cues, shapi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and verbal descriptions of 
articulation. When biofeedback is available, and visualization of is used to encourage the child to modify shape and position and to properly sequence movements for acceptable productions. A pre -established criterion (i.e., [ADDRESS_86541] producti ons of the target) must be met to progress from the pre-practice stage to the practice stage. For 
clients with significant difficulty producing the target sound sequences, pre -practice may take the majority of a 
session (during the early stages of therapy) ; for clients who have developed the ability to successfully perform the 
task (during the later stages of therapy), pre -practice may be completed in 1 -2 minutes.  
 During the practice  stage, there are multiple levels of practice with target stimuli that are chained. Chains involve a 
target sound sequence (e.g., /lo -/) produced first in syllables then in more complex environments. Each practice 
level involves [ADDRESS_86542] level; if fewer than [ADDRESS_86543], practice returns to the Level 1 on a different target (e.g., /kl -/). The first practice level is at the syllable level, followed by [CONTACT_79153], multisyllabic words, 
phrases, and se ntences. For each sound sequence that is targeted, 8 chains will be used for treatment in each 
session. The table below outlines the practice parameters.  
 Table 3: Practice Stage: Operationalized Parameters for Blocks of 6 Attempts (all sessions)  
Practice Level  Level [ADDRESS_86544]  Set phrase  Client -generated 
sentence  
Example chain  /lo/ Load  Loading  Loading the 
truck  [Loading  in 
sentence]  
 Each hour of therapy will address two different sound targets, with the first half of the session addressing one sound target and the second half addressing another; the order will be counterbalanced each session. Targets are selected as a phoneme in a syllable position, and four exemplars are se lected for that sound target. For example, /l/ in onset 
could be addressed with sound sequences such as /li -/, /lo -/, /kl -/, /pl -/ during the first half hour, and /k/ in coda 
could be treated with sound sequences such as / -ɪk/, / -ʊk/, / -ks/, / -sk/ during the second half hour. Targets will be 
selected based on the lowest percent accuracy before treatment based on the sound -specific Probes. Two targets 
will be treated per session; however, new targets will replace previous targets if the participant successfully completes Level 5 for 2 chains during 2 consecutive sessions.

6. Research Qualifications  
CITI training is required for the faculty member listed below and all researchers and research staff who have 
direct contact [CONTACT_79156]/or identifiable human participant data.   NOTE : If training is not 
completed at  the time of submission, approval of your application will be delayed.  
  
6.1. List the names and research qualifications of the primary investigator/faculty  advisor listed in Section [ADDRESS_86547] the name s and research qualifica tions of t he student/research staff listed in Section [ADDRESS_86548]. Preston’s lab manager part time (50% effort). She will conduct the assessments and treatment sessions. She has extensive experience managing sensitive data in both clinical and research environments. Her expertise is in working  with children with speech sound disorders and is therefore 
sensitive to the needs of both children and their parents.  [CONTACT_79177]  has completed CITI and Good 
Clinical Practice training (supporting documentation attached) for clinical research studies.  
 
Rev. 08/04/[ADDRESS_86549] the name(s) and research qualifications of all other individuals who will be involved in this research 
and will have direct cont act with participants and/or identifiable human participant data . 
Jaclyn Storto will serve as a research assistant who will hav e contact [CONTACT_79157]. She has 15 years of 
experience as a special education teacher and is therefore familiar with some of the particular needs 
of working with confidential data. She is enrolling in the Master ’s program in Speech -Language 
Pathology and has completed CITI and Good Clinical Practice training.  
 
6.4. How will you ensure that all persons listed above are adequately informed about the protocol and their 
research related duties and functions?   
A manual has been developed outlining the protocols that are  to be followed.  All members of the 
team will be required to read the manual to ensure familiarlity with technical and procedural issues. We will hold weekly lab meetings to review both procedural/compliance issues as well as scientific issues. We will ou tline responsibilities at each meeting (currently using the web -based system ASANA) 
and we will keep a running log of the status of recruitment, participation, data collection, data safety/confidentiality, and data analysis. All members are CITI -certified and will be instructed to 
immediately bring to the PI’s attention any Human Subjects related issues.   
6.5. Explain how you will have adequate numbers of qualified staff to conduct your study.   
The staff listed above are sufficient to collect and manage data fr om approximately [ADDRESS_86550] data management/coding activities for those participants.  
 
7. Characteristics of Participants  
7.1. Approximate Number of Participants to be recruited:  40 
                
7.2. Sex:  M    F     Both  
 
7.3. Age Range- Check all that apply:  
  0-6   (Include parental consent form)  
  7-17 (Include parental consent form and child assent form)  
  18-[ADDRESS_86551] ages to be included: 9;0 – 17;11  
7.4. When the age range indicates an upper limit, provide justification: This age range is chosen as it is 
sufficiently restrictive to enable homogeneity of participants, with all participants beyond the age of typi[INVESTIGATOR_79132] (approximately age 8 -9 yrs, Smit et al., 1990); additionally, prior 
work has shown that children below the age of 8 may show less growth with biofeedback treatments  
(Sjolie et al., 2016). Because participants may be randomized  to a treatment condition with an 
intensive component (e.g., 10 hours of therapy over 5 consecutive days), participants need to be old enough to  maintain attention to cognitively demanding tasks over  long durations. 
 
 
7.5. Does this study target one gender o r specific social/ethnic group(s)?  
  No. (Skip to 7. 6) 
  Yes. If yes, answer 7. 5.1. and 7.5.2. below. 
7.5.1.  If  yes, check all that are targeted/vulnerable populations (Code of Federal Regulations:

7.5.2.    Explain the rati onale for using this particular group(s): This is the age at which most children 
have typi[INVESTIGATOR_79133]; therefore, any errors present are unlikely to resolve 
due to maturation effects . Also, children over the age of 9;[ADDRESS_86552] the inclusion criteria:  
Participants must be native English speakers who hear English as the dominant language in their home setting. Participants must be in the age range of 9;0 – 17;11.  In the initial evaluation, all participants 
must pass a hearing screening. Additionally, participants must score at or better than -1.[ADDRESS_86553] 
deviations from the mean on the Matrix Reasoning Task of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence – 2
nd Edition (WASI -2; t-score ≥ 37), Peabody Pi[INVESTIGATOR_17122] – 4th Edition (PPVT-
4; standard score ≥ 80) , and the Following Directions subtest of the Clinical Evaluation of Language 
Fundamentals – 5th Edition (CELF -5; scaled score ≥ 6). Speech sound errors will be confirmed by [CONTACT_79158] -Fristoe Test of Articulation – 3rd Edition (GFTA -2; percentile ≤ 5th). A 
diagnosis of CAS will be verified using three research supported tasks which assess the participant’s the ability to plan/program complex speech move ments . The [ADDRESS_86554] 2 of the 3 tasks described below.

7.7. List the exclusion criteria:  
Participants will be excluded if parent report or direct evaluation reveals oral- facial structural 
abnormalities (e.g., cleft palate). We will not study participants whose parents report  kno wn genetic 
syndrome , neurobehavioral disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, obsessive -compulsive 
Rev. 08/04/16  Page 13 
 disorder), or vision problems that are corrected with glasses/contacts. ). We will also exclude 
individuals who fail a hearing  screening during the eligibility visit. These restrictions are put into place 
to enhance the internal validity of the study. In order to avoid confounding interpretation of the relations between treatment outcomes and language or cognitive abilities, we will exclude individuals with low nonverbal abilities  (as identified as being below the inclusionary criteria on the Matrix 
Reasoning subtest of the WASI -2, PPVT- 4, or Following Directions Subtest of the CELF -5). Participants 
will also be excluded if they do not meet  the CAS diagnostic criteria on 2/3 of the tasks described 
above. A Dysarthria Score of 2 on the Maximum Performance Tasks is also considered exclusionary (to 
avoid confounding interpretation of treatment outcomes).  Participants who are not in the target age 
range dur ing the entire range of their participation (9;0 – 17;11) will also be excluded.  
 
7.8. Does this research involve participants likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence?     
 No.  (Skip to 7. 9)   
 Yes.  If yes, des cribe the additional protections included in the protocol to protect their rights and    
          welfare.   
                    
7.9. General state of Health: ("Unknown" - unless you will obtain health data on participants prior to beginning 
the st udy.)   
“[Suspected] childhood apraxia of speech” The clinical diagnosis is inconsistently applied; therefore, we 
will use our own criteria to make this determination.  
8. Recruitment of Participants  
8.1. Describe in detail how participants will be identified and recruited. Include in your description how you  
will have access to a population that will allow recruitment for the number of participants required for 
your research.  Do not merely state “Volunteers”.  
Participants will be identified and recruited through flyers, informational letters, and emails that will 
be distributed to local speech- language pathologists who will be invited to share information about 
the study with parents of children who might benefit from participation in the study. In addition, flyers  
and online postings will be used to reach out to parents in the surrounding communities. Online postings will consist of a link to the flyer available via the (1) CSD department website (csd.syr.edu); (2) Speech Production Lab Website (speechproductionlab.syr.edu); (3) SU Today; (4) the American Speech -Language Hearing Association’s CLARC program (Clinicians and Researchers Acting Together; 
community.asha.org/clarc) of which [CONTACT_79176] is a member; and (5) the Childhood Apraxia of Speech 
Association of North America (CASANA.org). The research team will also contact [CONTACT_79159] ([ADDRESS_86555]), and private speech- language clinics (with publicly available addresses) and 
invite personnel at these locations to post/share a copy of our flyer ; they are free to decline. An 
announcement will be placed in the SU CSD Alumni newsletter and flyers will be passed out at Continuing Education events for speech- language pathologists throughout the year. We will pay to put 
an ad in the Central [LOCATION_001] S peech -Language Hearing Association newsletter. Additionally, links to 
information on the website will be tweeted (@JPrestons_SLP, @meganleece, @SyracuseCSD) and posted to Facebook ([CONTACT_79176]’s page, CNYSHLA page).   
Additionally, we will coordinate with speech -language pathologists at various schools.  Letters of 
support are attached.  
8.2. Describe who will recruit participants.

8.4. Will participants be compensated ?  
 No. (Skip to Section 9 ) 
 Yes. If yes, answer 8.4.1. and 8.4.2. below. 
Note: All informat ion regarding compensation must be included in consent/assent documents . 
8.4.1.    If Yes, specify the method of compensation (e.g. monetary, course credit, gift card, toy, etc.), the    
  amount of compensation, and how the compensation will be awarded (per task,  per session, etc.).  
Participants ’ parents  will be compensated at $20/ hr for all assessments (Visits B aseline 1, 
Baseline 2, 5-Week, 10 -Week, 2 -Month).   Participants ’ parents  will also  be compensated  $5 
per visit to defray travel costs; this applies to both assessment and treatment 
visits.   Participants ’ parents  would therefore be paid a total of approximately $2 15 for the 
entire study.  While separately obtaining assent, participants will be reminded that they may 
withdraw from the study at any time, and that they don’t have to participate in the study 
(even if their parents want them to).  
8.4.2.    Describe how compensation will be awarded if the participant withdraws after beginning the  
  study. Compensation must be pro -rated in a manner that recognizes the time and effort of the   
  participant prior to withdrawal.   
For any participant who withdraws part -way through an evaluation session, compensation 
will be pro -rated at $5 per quarter hour of time spent. Similarly, we will provide 
compensation at $20/hr ($5 p er quarter hr) for individuals who are evaluated for eligibility, 
but are excluded from the study due to a failure to meet eligibility criteria.  
9. In formed Consent Procedures  
Consent is required for all human subject participants. Final copi[INVESTIGATOR_79135]/assent document s (including 
electronic or oral scripts)  must be provided for IRB approval and date stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Informed consent/assent documents 
must be on official SU departmental letterhead . For guidance regarding informed consent,  consult  SOP 017-

   parental consent, Consent form 2 -adult participant consent; Assent form 1 -child assent, etc.)  
Rev. 08/04/16  Page 15 
 9.4. Indicate the type of consent you will obtain for your study (check all that apply).  
9.4.1.    Written Consent    (ATTACH COPY)  
Provide  a brief statement  of what  will be said when the consent process is initiated : 
Anytime we do research, we have to get permission. Before we ask for your permission, we 
want you and your parents to be aware of what will happen in the study and why. The Assent document that we read to you and the Consent document for your mom/dad explain the details. I’ll read the Assent to you and let your mom/dad look through the Consent document, 
and you’ll have a chance to ask questions before you decide if you want to participate or not.  
9.4.2.   Electronic Consent     (ATTACH SCRIPT)  (This is a request to waive the required element of     
documentation of written consent, e.g. internet studies.)  
9.4.3.    Oral Consent    (ATTACH SCRIPT)  
Provide the justification for the waiver of written consent :  
      
9.4.4.    N/A   Data Analysis Only, no consent form required . 
9.5. Who will conduct the consent interview?  
Megan Leece, Jonathan Preston  
9.6. How will you ensure that prospective participants have sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to 
participate in your study? 
We will conduct a phone screening with all parents/guardians (see Phone Screening) and will describe 
the study at the time and will answer questions. We will also send an electronic copy or a mailed copy of the consent form before they attend the first visit and will allow them to ask questions before signing the consent.  
9.7. What steps will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence?  
Assent is obtained separately from consent (thus, parent/guardian may sign consent, but participant may choose not to assent). Prior to signing the assent, participants will be told that they are not required to participate and that they may withdraw at any time. We will make them aware of other options available for treatment (e.g., the Gebbie Speech Language Hearing Clinic at SU, school district, private speech therapy)  
9.8. An ASSENT statement is required for participants who cannot legally give consent themselves. Assent 
statement:

10. Potential Fina ncial Conflict of Interest  
A conflict of interest exists when an y investigator or personnel  listed in th is research  protocol’s  financial interests may  
reasonably be affected by [CONTACT_79161], scholarship, educational or other externally funded activity. Or, whe n the immed iate 
family* of anyone in such a role, have significant financial interests that may compromise, or have the appearance of 
compromising, an investigator’s professional judgment that could directly and significantly affect the design, conduct, or 
reporting of the research, proposed or funded. 
 
Federal Guidelines emphasize the importance of assuring there are no conflicts of interest in research projects that could 
affect the welfare of human participants.  If this study involves or presents a potential conflict of interest, additional information will need to be provided to the Vice President for Research.  
 
The following significant financial interests must be disclosed if interest is in the sponsor of the research or the product 
being tested:   
Anything of monetary value - aggregated for the Investigator and the Investigator’s spouse, domestic partner, and 
dependent children - including but not limited to the following:  
a. Salary or other payment for services (e.g. consulting fees) of $10,[ADDRESS_86556] year when aggregated 
for the immediate family;  
b. Any equity interest (e.g. stocks, stock options or other ownership interests) unless it meets the following three tests:  
i. less than $10,000 in value as determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value (e.g. most recent sales price recognized by [CONTACT_7904]),  
ii. constitutes less than a 5% ownership interest in any single entity, or 
iii. publicly traded on a national stock exchange, 
iv. no arrangements have been made where the value of the interest will be affected by [CONTACT_79162].  
c. Intellectual property rights (e.g. patents, copyrights and royalties from such rights).  
d. Services as an officer, director, or in any other executive position in an outside business, whether or not remuneration is received for such service.  
e. Any compensation or equity interests that may be influenced by a particular outcome in sponsor-funded research, even if the identified thresholds are not met.

*Immediate family means a spouse, domestic partner or dependent children. 
10.1. Do any of the investigators or personnel listed in this research protocol, or members of the immediate    
               family of the investigator s or personnel, have a financial interest associated with this study that requires     
               disclosure?  
 No (Skip to question 10.3 )  
 Yes; If yes , identify the individual(s):         
10.2. Has this financial  interest been disclosed and managed?  
 Yes. The Office of Research Integrity and Protections will verify that a management plan is in place 
with the Vice President for Research.  
 No. If the Vice P resident for Research does not have an approved management plan for this 
research, complete Parts I and II of the Disclosure of Significant Financial Interest Form 
(http://osp.syr.edu/forms%20and%20pages/Forms/COI%20-
%20Disclosure%20of%20Financial%20Interests%20Form.PDF ) and submit it to the Office of the 
Vice President for Research, 304 Lyman Hall. 
10.3 To your knowledge, did the Univers ity, or your School/Department receive a gift or equipment donation, 
or promises thereof, from commercial sponsors of this research project?  
 No  
 Yes; If yes , identify the sponsor:         
 
Final IRB approval cannot be granted until all potential conflict matters are settled.  The IRB requires a 
recommendation from the Vice President for Research regarding disclosure to participants and management of the conflict.    
11. Data Collection, Storage of Data and/or Con fidentiality   
Confidentiality pertains to the treatment of information that an individual has disclosed in a relationship of trust with the expectation that it will not be divulged to others in ways that are inconsistent with the understanding of 
the origi nal disclosure without permission
. 
11.1. Specify the individually identifiable data you will obtain, use or disclose to others.  
Because this study involves many visits, we obtain data to be able to contact [CONTACT_2416]/parent.  This includes participant name , parent name, date of birth (to accurately score 
standardized tests), home address, and parent's phone number and email.  As part of the data 
collection for the study, audio recordings of treatment sessions will be collected and ultrasound images of the tongue may be collected (depending on randomization condition). Video images of a participant’s face may or may not be collected based on whether or not consent is obtained to collect these images (participants may opt in to video recording of the face).  
11.2. Describe how data will be maintained (e.g., paper or electronic spreadsheet, desktop computer, laptop  oe   
other portable device);  how you will maintain the confidentiality and data security, (e.g., password  
protected computer, encrypted files, locked  cabi net and office); and who will have access to the data (e.g., 
research team, sponsors, consultants).  
All paper- based study data will be stored in locked file cabinets in the principal investigator’s office 
and laboratory space. All electronic materials will  be stored in a password -protected database on a 
secure server shared  accessible only to  the members of the research team. Participants will be 
assigned a unique code that does not retain any personal information that could link the identifier to 
the participant. All data collected during study activities will be recorded on a data sheet that 
contains only subject identifier codes, with no personal information such as name, birthdate, 
address, or contact [CONTACT_3031].  
Rev. 08/04/[ADDRESS_86557] acce ss to identifiable private information about human 
subjects:  
• [CONTACT_79179], principal investigator  
• Megan Leece, Project/Lab manager, treating SLP  
• Jackie Storto, research assistant  
 
For the purpose of data rating, blinded outside listeners may l isten to audio recordings of single 
words produced by [CONTACT_79163]. However, these single words will 
be presented in random order and will not be paired with names or any other identifying data. The 
parent/guardian is specifically asked to consent to this sharing of audio data. Likewise, audio 
recordings of participants may be shared in academic audiences with the express consent of the 
participant and his/her guardian (see consent form).  
11.3. If you will be sharing data with othe rs, describe how data will be transferred (e.g., courier, mail) or  
transmitted (e.g., file transfer software, file sharing, email). If transmitted via electronic networks, 
describe how you will secure the data while in transit.  
We provide a summary of st andard scores from the testing, but we only provide a copy of this to the 
parent. They may share this with other professionals if they choose to do so.  For participants who 
sign to agree to allow us to use their ultrasound recordings of the tongue for educational purposes , 
we will select short video recordings ( about 1 minute ) of the child speaking words as illustrative 
examples to train speech -language pathologists to interpret the images.  Images of faces will not be 
publically available, only ultrasound images of the tongue. Parents may decline  to share this 
information for the training website but may still have their child participate in the study.  
 
11.4. If you plan to code the data, describe the method in which it will be coded and indicate who will have     
  access to the key to the code.  
Participants will be assigned an ID number and all data stored (hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_79136], audio/video 
files, etc) will be filed by [CONTACT_79164]. The key linking ID number with identifying information will be stored in a password -protected database that [CONTACT_79180] and [CONTACT_79177] can access.    
11.5. How will you educate research staff to ensure they take appropriate measures to protect the privacy of  
  participants and the confidentiality of data collected . 
Lab Meetings at the  beginning of each semester will begin with a review of lab policies related to 
privacy and confidentiality. We will review possible scenarios in which confidentiality could be inadvertently compromised (e.g., failure to log off of the computer or to close  the Excel file). We will 
review the process by [CONTACT_79165] (i.e., no written forms will have any private information, only password -protected files).  We will discuss the need for all communications 
about participants to refer only  to ID number, and the need to protect all private information. Any 
intended sharing of information with anyone outside of the laboratory must be cleared through the PI [INVESTIGATOR_79137].  Fortunately, most individuals who will access data have clinical experience and are well trained in safe and confidential handling of identifiable data in clinical situations.  
Privacy can be defined in terms of having control over the extent, timing, and circumstances of sharing oneself 
(physically, behaviorally,  or intellectually) with others.  
11.6. Describe what provisions are in place  to protect the privacy interests of participants, where “privacy    
interest of participants” refers to the participant’s desire to limit interventions or interactions with others 
and to limit access of others to their private information. Examples include: location of data collection 
(private location vs. public location), method of data collection (focus groups vs. one-on-one interview, 
Rev. 08/04/16  Page 19 
 questionnaires vs. interviews, telephone, email and mail communications ), type of information (written 
vs. oral), recruitment methods and cultural norms.  
Private data will be collected in one -on-one situations with the participant. Parents may observe 
these sessions via closed -circuit observation system  (CORS). When observing via CORS, parents will 
wear headphones to ensure participant privacy.  
They will wait in the Gebbie Clinic waiting area, which is a family -friendly environment, and others in 
the waiting area will likely be waiting for studies or for clinical services (though the specifics of these 
services are not disclosed). This would be similar to waiting in a doctor's office.  However, all 
participant -researcher interactions, including consent/assent interviews and data collection activities 
will be obtained in one -on-one situations with the participant in the Speech Production Laboratory.  
Communications with participants will be either email or phone, whichever the participant/parent prefers. Emails with identifying information are deleted once the information is stored in a password -
protected database.  
Recruitment will occur primarily through notices either on the CSD website, postings in the Gebbie clinic or other local speech -language clinics, and through speech -language pathologists . 
11.7. Will audio, video or film recording be used?     
     No.  (Skip to Section 12)    
  Yes . If yes, specify type of recording:  
Audio recordings of all sessions (required)  
Video recordings of ultrasound images (required)  
Video backup recording of the session using a camera stationed on the wall (optional)  
11.7.1.  Describe the storage of  the recordings.  Include in your description w ho will have access to the   
    recordings, as well as how and where  they will  be stored . 
Recordings will be stored on a user- restricted lab drive available only to lab members who 
are granted access ( follow ing IRB approval). The password for the lab drive is changed via 
SU ITS (consult.syr.edu) whenever there is lab staff turnover (typi[INVESTIGATOR_79138] a semester). Students log -in to a restricted account in the laboratory and can only access files 
from th e computers within the lab. Files will be stored by [CONTACT_79166].  
11.7.2.  How long will the recordings be kept and what is the disposition of the recordings once the  
    research is complete.  
It is required that all participants agree to audio recording as well as ultrasound video recording (no face) to track speech changes; no data would be usable without such recordings. However, parents will have opportunity to determine whether a video of the session (that includes the face) can be collected.  
 The recordings wil l be kept for 5 years after publication of final manuscripts, after which 
time they will be deleted.   
 If the parent provides permission  to use videos of the tongue for educational purposes , we 
will store selected clips of ultrasound recordings (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  < 60 seconds in length) of the 
tongue indefinitely for for training purposes for speech- language pathologists.  
NOTE : Specific permission  for each  type of recording  must be sought in the consent form and should be 
indicated at the end of the document using checkboxes ( _ I agree to be audio taped, _ I do not agree to be 
audio taped,  _ I agree to be video  taped, _I do not agree to be video taped,  etc.)  
12. Risk to Participants  
Rev. 08/04/16  Page 20 
 12.1.   Describe in detail any possible physical, psychological, social, political, legal, economic, or other risks to       
       the participants, either immediate or long range.  Risk may be minimal but never totally absent.  Do not      
                 say “No Risk”. 
Risks associated with the speech production and assessment components of this study are no 
greater than those in daily life. The ultrasound portion of this study likewise involves no more than 
minimal risk. Diagnostic ultrasound imaging is regarded as a safe and non -invasive technology (see 
Epstein, 2005, for a summary of this  research). While a number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_79139], no negative effects have been documented as a consequence of exposure to diagnostic ultrasound of the type used in this study (Ziskin & Petitti , 1988; Barnett et al., 2000).   Although certain types of ultrasound carry a slight risk 
that the temperature of the ultrasound probe may increase by [ADDRESS_86558] demonstrated that the imaging mode used in this study (B -mode) is rarely associated 
with probe temperature increases of even one degree Celsius.   Other risks associated with use of 
the ultrasound include tr ansfer of communicable disease from one person to another (such as the 
common cold) if the ultrasound probe is not disinfected between participants.  
 
 Risks associated with  the treatment  portion of the study  are those which would be associated with 
any spe ech-language therapy in schools.   This includes frustration and/or 
boredom  during  completion of tasks.   
 
12.2.   Describe what procedures will be used to minimize each risk you have stated above.  Also, include in  
  your description the availability of medical or psychological resources that participants might require as     
  a consequence of the research, if applicable. If participants need to be debriefed at the end of the study, a  
  copy of the debriefing statement must be attached.  
• To keep ultrasound expos ure to an appropriately limited amount, we only expose the participant to 
ultrasound for  approximately  13 minutes at a time, for less than half the session.  
• To ensure that the risk of communicable diseases  is reduced, we clean the ultrasound with 
approved  products between users (before and after each session).   
• To manage boredom/frustration,  during assessments, breaks will be offered between tasks, 
approximately every 15 -20 minutes. During treatment sessions,  a 1-minute break will be scheduled 
every 13 min utes (after each period of practice) during which participants will be offered a drink of 
water, access to the restroom, or will be engaged in brief conversation .  
 
12.3. Does this research involve more than minimal risks to participants?  
    No. (Skip to Section 13 )   
 Yes.  If yes, please provide plan for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
participants . (Your data safety monitoring plan must  include the following: Description of who will 
monitor the data, wha t data will be monitored, how frequently will it be moni tored, what analysis 
will be per formed on the data, what decision rules (e.g. stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]) will be considered, if  
unexpected harms will be detected promptly, if  an increased frequency or severity o f unexpected 
harms  will be detected promptly, if the protocol will be stopped once harms are proven to outweigh 
benefits.) . 
        
Rev. 08/04/16  Page 21 
 13. Benefits  
Note:  Course credit or payment  is an inducement to participate in the study and should not be described 
as a benefit of the research.  
13.1. Describe any benefits to the participants in general.  
Some children with Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) may improve the clarity (intelligibility ) of their 
speech. Additionally, parents will receive a statement of the child’s performance on standardized 
tests, which offer more information to them about their child’s communication skills.  
13.2. Society at large. 
We may learn more about the utility of ultrasound for treatment of speech sound errors in children with CAS. Additionally, we may learn more about whether the intensity/distribution of therapy 
(regardless of whether or not ultrasound is used) has a positiv e effect on children’s outcomes.  
13.3. Explain how the benefits outweigh the risks involved.  
The potential improvement in speech intelligibility for our participants, and the potential clinical 
impact of the findings related to (a) whether ultrasound is an effe ctive therapy tool (versus no 
ultrasound) and (b) whether practice distribution (distributed versus intensive then distributed) facilitates generalization are judged to outweigh the minimal risks associated with the study.

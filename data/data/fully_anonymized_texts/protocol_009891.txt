This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, multicenter study to evaluate LVEF 
measurement accuracy and reproducibility of DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced and 
unenhanced echocardiography as compared with non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance 
imaging (CMR) used as the truth standard.   
Subjects  will be enrolled over approximately [ADDRESS_101095]  or other methods (e.g. CMR, MUGA  scan) 
obtained within 6 months of enrollment  (Day 0)  to achieve  an approximately even 
distri bution within four pre -defined LVEF groups (>50, 41 -50, 30 –40, <30 %).  Subjects  
with optimal and sub-optimal  echocardiograms will be enrolled.  
Each patient will undergo an unenhanced ultrasound examination and a DEFINITY® 
contrast -enhanced examination on the same day  at Day [ADDRESS_101096]  30 minutes of observation after DEFINITY® administration.  The 
site investigator will determine whether an echocardiogram is optimal or sub -optimal 
based on the unenchanced echocardiogram performed on Day 0.   
A non -contrast CMR will be used as the truth standard.  CMR studies will be performed 
within ±[ADDRESS_101097] to an L VEF group will be determined by [CONTACT_85389].  
In addition, a safety follow -up phone call will be conducted at 72±24 hours after 
DEFINITY® administration.   
All echocardiography images will be interpreted by [ADDRESS_101098]’s unenhanced echocardiogram a s either optimal or 
suboptimal .  This will be independent of the site investigator determination .  All CMR 
images will be read centrally by a single reader.  Echocardiographic imaging data will be 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], analyzed, and stored without knowledge of the CMR findings . 
 
Study Population:   
Approximately one hundred and fifty (150) evaluable subjects will be enrolled at 
approximately [ADDRESS_101099]  
or other methods (e.g. CMR, MUGA  scan) to evaluate screening LVEF  within 6 months 
prior to  enrollment  (Day 0 ) may be enrolled.  The study population will consist of males 
and non -pregnant and non -lactating females 18 years -of-age or older.  
Duration of Treatment:   
Subjects will receive DEFINITY® treatment once as a part of a single day imaging session.

DEFINITY ® will be diluted with 8.7 mL of preservative -free saline to evenly distribute 
microspheres.  An initial injection of up to 3 mL of diluted DEFINITY ® will be 
administered with subsequent injections of 1 to 2 mL, as needed . 
Efficacy Assessments:  
The primary endpoint is to  demonstrate an improvement in LVEF accuracy from 
unenhanced imaging to imaging with DEFINITY® contrast enhancement using CMR as 
the truth standard.   
The secondary endpoints are to:  
1. Demonstrate improvement in accuracy in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
assessment using DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced over unenhanced echocardiography 
in subje cts with suboptimal echocardiograms.  
2. Demonstrate a reduction in inter -reader variability for the assessment of LVEF using 
DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced versus unenhanced echocardiography.

Safety Assessments:  
Enrolled subjects will be followed for adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and changes in concomitant medications from the time the Informed Consent (IC) is 
signed through 72±24 hours after completion of DEFINITY® administration.  All AEs will 
be recorded on the electronic case report form (e CRF ).  The N ational Cancer Institute  
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) version 4.0 will be 
utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting  of severity . 
Statistical Methods  for Primary Objective :  
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate improvement in accuracy in left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment using DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced 
over unenhanced echocardiography , using CMR a s the truth standard.   
The following analyses will be carried out for each of the three blinded readers.  For each 
subject , the absolute value of the difference of DEFINITY® LVEF minus CMR LVEF 
will be calculated.  Similarly, the absolute value of the dif ference of unenhanced imaging 
DEFINITY ®  Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol :  DEF -[ADDRESS_101101] .  The primary analysis is to 
assess the significance of the difference between DEFINITY® and unenhanced echo with 
respect to the mean “absolute value of the difference vs . CMR”.  These means will be 
compared with a paired t -test at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.  Specifically, the 
null and alternative hypotheses are:  
H0: µD = µU vs. H1: µD ≠ µU  
Where µD is the mean of the absolute value of the difference s between the DEFINITY ®-
enhanced echo LVEF and the CMR LVEF. Similarly, µU is the mean of the absolute value 
of the differences between the unenhanced echo LVEF and the CMR LVEF.  A sample of 
size of 150 enrolled subjects has 90% power to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the 
alternative if the true difference µD - µU is at least 2.[ADDRESS_101102] deviation of 10 or 
less and allows for approximately 5% premature withdrawal.   If the null hypothesis is 
rejected in favor of DEFINITY® for at least two of three bl inded readers, the primary 
analysis will be considered a success.  
The following are additional analyses to be carried out separately for each blinded reader 
to achieve the primary objective:  
Bias is the mean of the actual (not absolute value) per -subject d ifferences between the 
imaged LVEF and CMR LVEF.  The bias, the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the 
bias, the precision (standard deviation of the per -subject differences) and the root mean 
square error (RMSE) will be calculated  for DEFINITY® .  The RM SE is the square root of 
the bias -squared + precision -squared and is considered a measure of overall accuracy.  
These analyses will be repeated for unenhanced echocardiography vs. CMR.   It is 
anticipated that the RMSE will be smaller for DEFINITY® -enhance d LVEF than for 
unenhanced LVEF.  
DEFINITY® -enhanced and unenhanced echocardiography LVEF will each be assessed for 
measurement accuracy against the reference CMR using Bland -Altman analysis and 
Deming regression analysis.   For the Bland -Altman analysis , a plot of  per-subject actual 
difference between DEFINITY® -enhanced echocardiography and CMR LVEF will be 
plotted vs. the per -subject sum of the two measurements. Limits of agreement (defined as 
the mean of the DEFINITY® vs. CMR difference) +/ - [ADDRESS_101103] . 
Deming r egression plots of LVEF vs. CMR LVEF will be generated for each of 
DEFINITY® -enhanced and unenhanced echocardiography.  Unweighted Demi ng 
regression will be employed to estimate the regression slope and intercept with two -sided 
95% confidence intervals of each , assuming the measurement error is the same for CMR 
and each of the echocardiography error techniques.

Statistical Methods for Secondary Objective s: 
A secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate improvement in accuracy in left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment using DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced over 
unenhanced echocardiography in subjects  with suboptimal echocardiograms.  For this, the 
above analyses for the primary objective will be repeated on subjects  with suboptimal 
echocardiograms.  
An additional secondary objective is to demonstrate a reduction in inter -reader variability 
for the assessment of LVEF and End -Diastolic/Systolic volumes using DEFINITY® 
contrast -enhanced versus unenhanced echocardiography.   The inter -observer variability 
among each pair of readers within each imaging modality will be estimated using an intra -
class correlation coefficient (ICC) ; descriptive comparisons of the ICC between 
DEFINITY® and unenhanced echocardiography will be carried out .  Similar analyses will 
be conducted for the final secondary objective of assessing inter -reader variability within 
subjects with suboptimal echocardiograms.

1.1 Background  
Left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) are important clinical parameters 
for the diagnosis , management,  and prognosis of subjects  with cardiac diseases. Important 
treatment decisions and the evaluation of therapeutic effects are based on these parameters.  
Several techniques have been used for the analysis of LV volumes and EF, among them cine 
ventriculography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed 
tomography  (Foley 2012) .[ADDRESS_101116] , besides geometric assumptions resulting from the 
two-dimensional approach  (Foley 2012) .[ADDRESS_101117] echocardiography has 
been shown to allow improved assessment of LV volumes and EF, especially in subjects  with 
difficult imaging conditio ns (Hoffman 2005, 2014 ,).2,[ADDRESS_101118] -
enhanced ultrasound imaging.  
DEFINITY® (perflutren injectable suspension) is a sterile, non -pyrogenic suspension of 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] -encapsulated perfluoropropane microbubbles that is activated by [CONTACT_91541]™.  In subjects  with suboptimal echocardiograms, the addition of 
DEFINITY® improves the assessments of cardiac structure (ventricular chambers and 
endocardial borders) and function (regional wall motion).  
The objective of this multicenter study is to determine the accuracy and inter -reader 
agreement of DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced  and unenhanced 2D echocardiography for the 
assessment of LV volumes and EF in comparison with  non-contrast  CMR.  
This trial will be conducted strictly according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
the sites’ Independent Ethics Committees  (IECs) /Institutional Review Boards  (IRBs) , and 
other related laws and regulations  as applicable .

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, multicenter study to evaluate LVEF measurement 
accuracy and r eproducibility of DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced and unenhanced 
echocardiography as compared with non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 
(CMR) used as the truth standard.  Approximately o ne-hundred  fifty (150) evaluable subjects 
will be enrolled and will undergo unenhanced  and DEFINITY®-enhanced echocardiograms 
and CMR .   
Subjects will be screened based on LVEF measurements obtained via 2D echo with or 
without contrast or other methods (e.g. CMR, MUGA  scan) obtained within 6 months prior 
to enrollment.    Subjects  will be stratified to achieve an approximately even distribution 
within four pre -defined LVEF groups (>50, 41 -50, 30 –40, <30%) as measured by [CONTACT_85389].  
Subjects with optimal and suboptimal echocardiograms will be enrolled .   
Each patie nt will undergo an unenhanced ultrasound examination and a DEFINITY® 
contrast -enhanced examination on the same day.  A minimum of 360 seconds  of images will 
be collected during both the unenhanced and the DEFINITY® contrast -enhanced 
examinations.   
The sit e investigator will determine whether an echocardiogram is optimal or sub -optimal 
based on the unenchanced echocardiogram performed on Day 0.  An echocardiogram is 
considered suboptimal if [ADDRESS_101121] 30 minutes of observation after the end of 
the administration of DEFINITY®.  A safety follow -up telephone call will be conducted for 
all subjec ts at approximately 72 ±24 hours after completion of the imaging sessions.   
Enrolled subjects will be followed for AEs , SAEs, and changes in concomitant medications 
from the time the Informed Consent is signed through the safety follow -up telephone call.   
Unenhanced and DEFINITY®-enhanced echocardiograms will be performed with standard 
api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 2 chamber, api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 3 chamber, and api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 4 chamber, (A2C, A3C, and A4C, 
respectively) views.  DEFINITY®-enhanced echocardiograms will be performed using low or 
very lo w mechanical index (MI) imaging.  Images will be recorded in standard digital format, 
masked to patient identifiers, and sent to a central echocardiography facility for analysis.  
There, 3  experienced independent blinded readers will interpret the results according to the 
Image Review Charter; additional analyses will also be performed as described in the Image 
Review Charter.  Each reader’s independent interpretation will be recorded in a database.

results of an independent assessment and subsequent analysis conducted by [CONTACT_91542].  Secondary endpoints will also be assessed, including accuracy in the 
suboptimal echocardiogram subset and inter -reader variability in the overall population and 
the suboptimal echocardiogram subset.  
Interpretation of images will be conducted with a blinded read by [CONTACT_91543] a central imaging laboratory who are not associated with patient recruitment.  
In addition, a single, independent, blinded echocardiologist will read each subject’s 
unenhanced echocardiogram as either optimal or suboptimal.  This will be independen t of the 
site investigator determination  performed at Day 0 .  The independent readers  will employ a 
prospectively defined and standardized methodology described in the Image Review Charter, 
which will reduce the potential for variation in the criteria used  for image reads.  
CMR images will also be collected and read independently at a central imaging laboratory, 
using a methodology that will also be described in the Image Review Charter.  
3.3 Study Duration  
All screening assessments will occur within 7 days prior  to enrollment/ DEFINITY® 
administration  (Day 0) .  Non-contrast CMR studies will occur within ± 30 days of 
DEFINITY® administration.  Safety monitoring will begin with the signing of the informed 
consent and continue up to 72±[ADDRESS_101124]-DEFINITY® administration.   The expected 
duration of subject  participation is not more than 41  days.   Subjects are expected  be enrolled 
over a 10 month period.

Approximately o ne hundred and fifty (150) evaluable  subjects  who have previously 
undergone a 2D echocardiogram  with or without contrast  or other assessment (CMR, MUGA  
scan) will be enrolled in this trial.  The study population will consist of male and female 
subjects 18 years of age or older.   
Enrollment will be s tratified according to CMR LVEF to achieve an approximately even 
distribution across four subgroups ( LVEF >50, 41 -50, 30 –40, <30%) .  LVEF for screening 
purposes will be determined by [CONTACT_91544]  2D e cho or 
other methods (e.g. CMR, MUGA  scan) obtained within 6 months prior to enrollment  (Day 
0). Subjects  with optimal and sub -optimal echocardiograms will be enrolled.   Suboptimal 
echocardiograms will be based on the site investigator’s evaluation of the unenhanced 
echocardiography images obtained on Day 0.   An e chocardiogram is considered sub optimal 
if [ADDRESS_101126] meet the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in this

5.1 Description of Treatment(s)  
5.1.[ADDRESS_101131]  
DEFINITY® is an ultrasound contrast agent consisting of phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] -encapsulated 
perfluoropropane (PFP), also known as perflutren, microspher es, which is designed to 
enhance echocardiographic ultrasound images.  DEFINITY® (perflutren injectable 
suspension) will be provided in a 2 -mL clear vial containing a 1.5 mL fill volume.  
DEFINITY® contains no preservative.  Bacterial contamination with the risk of 
post-administration septicemia can occur following the puncture of the elastomeric septum.  
It is essential to follow directions for preparation of DEFINITY® carefully and to adhere to 
strict aseptic procedures during preparation.  
The chemical, and pharmacologic properties and formulation of DEFINITY® are described in 
detail in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) .   
5.2 Treatments Administered  
All treatments will be administered as described in the Dose Preparation and Administration 
Guide.  Appendix 2 . 
5.2.1  Administering Study Drug  
DEFINITY® will be administ ered as a diluted  bolus injection.  1.3 mL of activated 
DEFINITY® will be diluted with 8.7 mL of preservative -free saline to evenly distribute 
microspheres.  An initial  injection of up to 3  mL of diluted  DEFINITY® will be administered 
with subsequent injec tions of 1 to 2 mL, as needed .  Full details are available in the Dose 
Preparation and Administration Guide – Appendix 2 .

6.1 Screening  
The timing of study procedures is provided in  Appendix 1 .  All Screening/Baseline 
assessments will occur within 7 days prior to administration of study drug  (Day 0) . 
6.2 Informed Consent  
Informed consent (IC) must be obtained from each patient prior  to the initiation of any study 
related procedures unless those procedures are considered standard of care for the diagnosis 
and/or treatment of the underlying disease process.  The IC must meet the requirements as 
defined by [CONTACT_91545] (ICH ) - Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, US Federal Regulations and/or conform to national or regional regulatory agency 
requirements, or local laws , whichever provides the greatest level of protection.  Each patient 
must be provided, in a n understandable manner, a written informed consent form  (ICF) that 
describes the nature and duration of the study.  Additionally, the patient must be allowed 
adequate time to consider the potential risks and benefits associated with his/her participation 
in the study.  The IC must also contain language that allows the Sponsor (or designated 
representative), regulatory authorities, and the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Institutional 
Ethics Committee (IEC) direct access to the patient’s medical records f or the purpose of 
review.  
In situations where study subjects  are not legally competent to provide consent ( i.e., 
cognitively  incapacitated patient), written consent must be obtained from an authorized 
guardian or representative.  In these situations, the I CF must be signed and dated by a witness 
and, if possible, assent must be obtained from the patient.  The ICF must also be signed and 
dated by [CONTACT_91546].  
The Investigator, as part of the study documentation, must retain the original signed and 
dated ICF and must provide a signed copy to each patient or authorized representative.   The 
Investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required only for the clinical study until 
valid consent has been obtained.  
6.3 Medical History  
A ge neral medical history for each patient will be obtained by [CONTACT_91547] a 
review of available medical records.  Data to be collected and recorded on the eCRF will 
include demographics (e .g. age, gender, race/ethnicity) and an overview of significa nt past or 
present illnesses, including previous administration of DEFINITY®.  Known drug allergies, 
other allergies, or history of hypersensitivity reactions will also be recorded on the eCRF.

discussed in Section  8.4.1 .  The NCI -CTCAE version 4.0 will be utilized for Adverse Event 
(AE) reporting of severity  by [CONTACT_479] . 
An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational or marketed) product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal (investigational or marketed) product.  
Note:  For this clinical trial, observations and findings (previously unknown) discovered 
during the procedures and medically assessed as most -likely pre -existing (e.g., myocardial 
wall hypokinesis, thrombus, cardiac valve deficits, and so on) will not be considered AEs and 
will not be reported as such in the eCRF .  However, these observations and any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]/treatments required to treat the new findings will be reported elsewhere in 
the eCRF.  Any complications resulting from th e study procedures (e.g., intravenous 
extravasations) will be recorded as an AE.   
A medication error is defined as any event related to the administration of a medicinal or 
investigational product that may cause or lead to inappropriate use or patient har m.  
Medication errors can be actual or potential errors and may include misuse, administration 
error, overdose, under -dose, or abuse.  For this clinical trial, any medication errors (e.g., 
administration error, overdose, etc., that occur at the time of stu dy product  administration ) 
must be recorded as an AE.  
All identified AEs must be recorded and described on the appropriate AE section of the 
eCRF by [CONTACT_093] (or designee). If known, a diagnosis should be recorded, rather than 
multiple individual symptoms.  In addition to the event term, the following information 
should be captured for all AEs:  
• Date (and time) of onset and resolution  
• Severity of the event (see definitions below)  
• Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_91535] c omparator, procedure, 
or underlying disease (see definitions below)  
• Treatment action taken  
• Information regarding resolution/outcome

occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
• Protection of safety of study subjects , 
• Greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the investigational product,  
• Appropriate modification of study protocols, and  
• Adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.  
 
Adverse event monitoring will be initiated at the time the informed consent is signed  and will 
continue until completion of all echo assessments and patient discharge.  All subjects  will be 
followed up by [CONTACT_91549] s for AEs at 72±24 hours following DEFINITY® 
administration.  
6.10.3  Severity  
The Investigator (or designee) will assess the severity of the AE using the National Cancer 
Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) version 4.0 will 
be utilized for Adverse Event (AE) reporting.  The NC I-CTCAE definitions of severity are 
below.   
Grade  Degree of Severity  
1 Mild, with mild or no symptoms; no interventions required  
2 Moderate; minimal intervention indicated; some limitation of activities  
3 Severe but not life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_91536]; limitation of patient's ability 
to care for him/herself  
4 Life threatening; urgent intervention required  
5 Death related to adverse event  
 
This assessment is subjective and the Investigator should use good clinical judgment to 
compare the reported AE to similar type experiences observed in clinical practice.

Clinical Study Protocol :  DEF -[ADDRESS_101149] 2018  
   
Confidential  Page 29 of 49 6.10.4  Relationship  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to DEFINITY®. The following 
categories and definitions of causal relationship should be used for this st udy: 
• Not related : indicates that there is little or no chance that the study treatment or 
procedure caused the reported AE; other conditions, including concomitant illnesses, 
progression or expression of the disease state, or a reaction to a concomitant medication, 
appear to explain the reported AE.  For the purposes of determining expedited 
reportability, AEs categorized as unlikely related to investigational product will not be 
considered associated with the investigational product.  
• Possibly related : indicates that the association of the AE with the study treatment or 
procedure is unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably attributed to any other 
condition  
• Related:  indicates that a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and 
study treatment or procedure and, based upon the investigator’s clinical experience, the 
association of the event with the study treatment seems likely  
 
6.10.5  Clinical Significance  
Any a bnormality in physical examinations  or vital signs  not present at Baseline should be 
judged for clinical significance by [CONTACT_737].  
6.10.6  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is defined by [CONTACT_91550] d ose that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  
• In-patient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical ev ents that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of th e outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include

blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Note: H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_91537] -study conditions should not be 
classified as SAEs. Examples of this would include a scheduled coronary intervention or 
CABG procedure within the SAE reporting period.  Additionally, a treatment procedure 
scheduled due to diagnosis during the investigational procedure would not be classified as an 
SAE.   An example of this would be  angioplasty to treat a patient’s underlying CAD .  Events 
resulting from the investigational procedure or a worsening of a pre -study condition which 
satisfy the definition of a SAE must be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to  the investigational produc t, must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_101151]  be kept on file at the study site.  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Thus, 
follow -up information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838] a nd autopsy reports), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the 
same procedure as the initial SAE report.

unenhanced imaging , DEFINITY® -enhanced imaging , and cardiac MR studies .  This is the 
primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Per-Protocol Population  
The Per -Protocol (PP) population will include all subject s in the m ITT population  who a) did 
not violate inclusion and exclusion criteria that would likely have an effect on the primary 
outcome, b) do not have major protocol violations; c) have LVEF data o n both unenhanced 
and DEFINITY®- enhanced for at least one reader; (d) have CMR LVEF.

Confidential  Page 34 of 49 Efficacy analyses will be conducted for both mITT and PP population sets .  Differences in 
results using the two populations will be carefully examined  and the results of  that evaluation 
presented in the study report . 
8.2 Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
8.2.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint   
The primary analysis  is to demonstrate an improvement in LVEF accuracy from unenhanced 
imaging to imaging with DEFINITY® contrast enhancement using CMR as the t ruth 
standard.  For each patient, the absolute value of the difference of DEFINITY® LVEF minus 
CMR LVEF will be calculated.  Similarly, the absolute value of the difference of unenhanced 
imaging LVEF minus CMR LVEF will be calculated for each patient.  The primary analysis 
is to assess the significance of the difference between DEFINITY® and unenhanced echo 
with respect to the mean “absolute value of the difference vs. CMR”.  These means will be 
compared with a paired t -test at a two -sided 0.05 level of significance.  Specifically, the null 
and alternative hypotheses are:  
H0: µD = µU vs. H1: µD ≠ µU  
where µD and µU are the mean of the DEFINITY® and unenhanced echo absolute value of 
the difference vs. CMRs, respectively.  A sample of size 150 enrolled subjects has 90% 
power to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the tr ue difference µD - µU is 
at least 2.75 (in favor of DEFINITY®) with a standard deviation of 1 0 or less and allows for 
approximately 5% premature withdrawal.  
The analyses will be conducted separately for each of the three blinded readers of the 
DEFINITY® enhanced and unenhanced images; the criterion for success is that the null 
hypothesis is rejected in favor of DEFINITY® for at least 2 of the 3 blinded readers.  CMR 
LVEF is interpreted by a single reader; this is the CMR LVEF that will be used as the 
compar ator for each of the three blinded readers.  
The primary analysis will be performed on mITT subjects with non -missing LVEF for 
DEFINITY®, unenhanced echocardiography, and the reference standard.  A supportive 
analysis will be run where a missing echocardiog raphy or CMR LVEF is multiply imputed 
using the fully conditional specification (FCS) multiple regression, as outlined below and as 
will be further detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The following are additional analyses to be carried out  separatel y for each blinded reader  to

error (RMSE ) will be calculated for DEFIN ITY®.  The RMSE is the square root of the bias -
squared + precision -squared and is considered a measure of overall accuracy.  These analyses 
will be repeated for unenhanced echocardiography vs. CMR.   It is anticipated that the RMSE 
will be smaller for DEFINITY®-enhanced LVEF than for unenhanced LVEF.  
DEFINITY®-enhanced and unenhanced echocardiography LVEF will each be assessed for 
measurement accu racy against the reference CMR using Bland -Altman analysis and Deming 
regression analysis.  For the Bland -Altman analysis, a plot of the per -subject difference 
between DEFINITY®-enhanced echocardiography and CMR LVEF will be plotted vs. the 
per-subject sum  of the two measurements. Limits of agreement (defined as the mean of the 
DEFINITY® vs. CMR difference) +/ - [ADDRESS_101159].  
Deming reg ression plots of LVEF vs. CMR LVEF will be generated for each of

will be employed to estimate the regression slope and intercept with two -sided 95% 
confidence intervals of ea ch assuming the measurement error is the same for CMR and each 
of the echocardiography error techniques.  
The intra -class correlation coefficient (ICC) and its two -sided 95% confidence interval will 
be calculated for DEFINITY®-enhanced echo vs. CMR and for unenhanced echo vs. CMR.  
The ICCs and their two -sided confidence intervals will be calculated using between and 
within mean squares from an ANOVA model with method (echocardiography, CMR) and 
subject as the main effects and LVEF as the dependent variable.   The ICC will be calculated 
using the SAS macro developed by [CONTACT_91554] (1990).7

will be conducted by [CONTACT_91557] a pre -specified plan using the 
method of  by [CONTACT_91558] (2011).1 Specifically, at the interim stage the conditional 
power (CP) for obtain ing a significant beneficial effect of DEFINITY® over unenhanced 
imaging with respect to the primary endpoint will be calculated  for each blinded reader , 
using the protocol -specified planned sample size of 150 enrolled  subjects (approximately 143 
evaluable  subjects assuming 5% premature withdrawal) . This conditional power will be 
calculated under the assumption that the interim estimate of DEFINITY® -unenhanced 
difference is the true population difference. Specifically, the calculation of conditional power 
will be as follows:  
Let µD be the true mean of the absolute value  of the LVEF differences between the 
DEFINITY® -enhanced echo LVEF and the CMR LVEF, and let µU be the true mean of the 
absolute value  of the LVEF differences between the unenhanced echo LVEF and the CMR 
LVEF.  After 75 patients are enrolled and followed (which should lead to approximately 71 
evaluable patients ), an unblinded interim analysis will be conducted to determine whether 
sample size should be increased to maintain adequate conditional  power of up to 90%  for 
each reader . Conditional Power (CP) for rejecting the null hypothesis  in favor of

absolute value of the differences between the DEFINITY® -enhanced echo LVEF  and the 
CMR LVEF, and µU is the mean of the absolute value of the differences between the 
unenhanced echo LVEF and the CMR LVEF; Δ will be set to the value observed at the 
interim (the calculation of Δ is described below; it is not correct to calculate it  as the 
interim point estimate of µU minus the interim point estimate of µD). 
d. I1 is the observed “information” at the interim analysis based on the interim observed 
standard deviation of µD minus µE; its calculation is described below.  
e. I2 is the anticipate d “information” at the final analysis; its calculation is described below.  
f. t1 is the interim paired t -statistic testing the null hypothesis, calculated from the data 
observed at the interim  
 
Further information on the above parameters  is as follows:  
Assumi ng the Definity -CMR raw LVEF difference (not absolute value) is normally 
distributed with mean μ and sd σ, then its absolute value, D, follows the folded normal  
distribution with true mean and sd as follows:  
𝜇𝐷=√2
𝜋𝜎𝑒−𝜇2
𝜎2+𝜇[1−2Φ(−𝜇
𝜎)]         𝜎𝐷=√𝜇2+𝜎2−𝜇𝐷2 
where ϕ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. A similar algorithm can be 
applied  to the unenhanced -CMR LVEF raw difference and its absolute value U to determine 
µU  and σU.  In the above CP formula, Δ will be set to the estimate of µD - µU, where the 
estimates of µU and µD  are each calculated from the above equation using point estimates of 
the relevant μ and σ.  The standard deviation of the difference between the absolute value of 
D minus the absolute value of U is  
√𝜎𝐷2+𝜎𝑈2−2∗𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝐷,𝑈) where 2∗𝐶𝑜𝑣 (𝐷,𝑈)=𝜌∗ 𝜎𝐷∗𝜎𝑈  
 
where ρ is the correlation between D and U. This standard will be used in the calculation of 
the “information”, as further described below.  
So, in the CP formula for this example,

The study will not be stopped for overwhelming efficacy or futility at this interim stage. 
Instead, b ased on Table 1 of Mehta and Pocock (201 1),1 the following algorithm will be 
carried out:  (1) if the CP ≤ 36% for at least two of the three blinded readers based on the 
final sample size , the study will continue to its original planned sample size of 150 enrolled 
subjects ; otherwise (2) if the  CP ≥ 90% for at least two of the three blinded readers based on 
the final sample size , the study will continue to its original planned sample size of 150 
enrolled subjects ; (3) if 36% < CP <90% (the Mehta and Pocock “promising zone”)  for at 
least two of the thr ee readers based on the final sample size , then the sample size will be 
increased so that the CP is at least 90% for every reader whose CP fell in the promising zone.  
However, if there is a reader who does not fall in the promising zone, then that reader’ s 
primary results will be based only on the patients enrolled under the original protocol -
specified sample size.  Further, for every reader for whom the sample size is increased, that 
reader’s results will only be based on the first X images, where X is th e number of images 
that yielded CP of 90%.  T he sample size may be increased   up to 300 enrolled subjects  
(twice the protocol -planned sample size) for a given reader in order to obtain 90% CP.  If for 
a given reader that falls into the promising zone,  the maximum increase to 300 enrolled 
subjects  still does not yield 90% CP, the sample size may still be increased to 300 for this 
reader to maximize  conditional power,  at the discretion of the independent statistician) .  If 
(1), (2), and (3) above are not  satisfied, the study will continue to its original planned sample 
size of 150 enrolled subjects . This approach to sample size increase does not inflate the 
overall Type I error  for a given reader . 
The sponsor and investigators will remain blinded to the i nterim results for the duration of 
the ongoing study.  After the interim analysis is carried out, the recommendation made to the 
sponsor will only be to keep sample size as is or to increase enrolled sample size to a given 
value; the reason for the recomme ndation will not be given to the sponsor.

1.1 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR SCHEMA  
 
Names  of lnvestiaational  druas:  Durvalumab  and Tremel imumab  
Title of Study:  Phase  II Study  to Assess  the Efficacy  of Durvalumab  and Tremelimumab  plus Radiotherapy  or 
Ablation  in Patients  with Metastatic  Colorectal  Cancer  
Study  Centers:  MSKCC  
Study  Period:  24 months  I Phase  of Development:  II 
Objectives:  
The primary  objective is Overall  Response Rate in disease  that is not ablated or radiated (Complete  
Response  and Partial  Response).  
The secondary  objectives  are: 
1. Safety  and tolerability  of durvalumab and tremelimumab  plus radiotherapy  (RT) or ablation 
2. Oi.erall  Sun.ival  of durvalumab and tremelimumab  plus RT or ablation  
3. Progression free survival rate  at 1 year 
4. Progression free survival  rate at 2 years  
The exploratory  objectives  are to evaluate biomarkers  that may correlate with activity  of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab  plus RT or durvalumab  and tremelimumab  plus ablation in colorectal  cancer  (CRC),  or 
orosoectii.e lv identifv  CRC  oatients  likelv to resoond  to treatment.  
Study  Design: This will be a Simon  two-stage  design,  phase  II study.  It will be conducted  to determine  the 
efficacy and safety of (1) durvalumab and tremelimumab  plus RT in subjects  with metastatic  CRC who are  
undergoing  RT as standard  therapy;  and, (2) durvalumab  and tremelimumab  plus ablation in subjects  with 
metastatic  CRC  who are undergoing  ablation as standard  therapy.  Eligible  patients  will hai.e  metastatic  
colorectal  cancer  and received  at least two prior standard  therap ies for metastatic disease for which they are 
considered appropriate.  Patients  will be stratified  according to eligibility  for RT (cohort  1) or ablation (cohort  2). 
Patients in cohort  1will have at least one metastatic lesion for which  palliatiw  RT is considered appropriate  
standard  therapy,  and at least one other  measurab le index  lesion that will not undergo RT. Patients in cohort  
[ADDRESS_914827] one other measurable  index  lesion  that will not undergo ablation.  All subjects  will undergo  
ablation or begin RT within  7 days  after dose  #1 of durvalumab and tremelimumab.  Subjects  will receii.e  
durvalumab and tremelimumab every  four weeks  (Q4W),  for 4 months,  and then continue durvalumab alone  
every  four weeks  (Q4W)  until confirmed  progression of disease,  initiation  of alternative  cancer therapy,  
unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons to  discontinue  treatment  occur.  Patients  who had a prior  response,  
continued  on durvalumab monotherapy and did not discontinue  tremelimumab due to toxicity  may resume  
combination  therapy  with tremelimumab  plus durvalumab  for [ADDRESS_914828]  
cases.  Repeat  palliatii.e  RT or ablation  may include measurable index  lesion(s)  that is(are) being  followed for 
response measurements  if at least  one index  lesions  remains to  be followed.  Patients  will be evaluated  by 
[CONTACT_676583].ery [ADDRESS_914829] 1.1. Subjects  
may continue to receive durvalumab  and tremelimumab  beyond  radiographic  progression in the absence of 
clinical deterioration.  All subjects  will be followed up to 2 years  for survival  or until the study  closes.  The 
primary  endpoint  of this trial is the response  rate in CRC treated with RT plus durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
(cohort  1) or ablation plus durvalumab and tremelimumab (cohort  2). A two-stage  Simon's  optimal  design will 
be employed  to test the null hypothesis  that the true response rate is S5%  versus  the altematii.e  hypothesis  
that the true response  rate is at least 25% with type I and II error rates  of 10% each.  Each cohort  will be 
evaluated  separately  for this purpose.  In the first stage,  we will accrue  9 patients  in each cohort.  If 0 objectii.e  
tumor responses  (PR or CR) are observed among  the [ADDRESS_914830] 1 response is observed,  it may be expanded under  the investigator's  discretion,  regard less of 
the other  cohort's  accrual  status.  In the likelihood  that we observe  at least one resoonse  in each  of the 9

•  
 
 
subjects  treated in stage 1 of the two cohorts,  iiwill be at the discretion  of the investigators  which  cohort  to 
expand based on phannacodynami c data (such  as circulating CEA,  changes  in composition/activation status  
of lymphocyte subsets  present  in peripheral  blood mononuclear  cell preparati ons or tumor  
immunohi slochemistry  analysis,  and/or  circulating cytokines/  chemokines).  At the end of the study,  if [ADDRESS_914831] 1.1 are 
observed in a cohort,  then further  investigation of durvalumab and tremelimumab plus RT and/or  durvalumab  
and tremelimumab plus ablation will be considered worthwhile.  The study  will complete when all subjects  have  
either progressed  or discontinued from the study  for other  reasons.  This study  requires  accrual  of a minimum  
of 1S subjects  and up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_914832] 9 patients  in each cohort.  On 
treatment  biopsies  will be perfonned 1 week  after the completion  of radiation  or ablation (of the radiated/  
ablated  lesion)  and then 4 weeks  after dose  #1 of durvalumab  andlremel imumab (of a non-radiated/  ablated  
lesion). Tumor  immunohistochemistry  may be perfonned for PD-L 1 expression  and quantification of tumor 
infiltrat ing lymphocyte (TIL)  subtypes,  including CDS+  T-cells,  CD4+  T-cells,  Regu latory  T-cells (Treg),  and 
Myeloid Derived Suppressor  Cells  (MDSCs).  Peripheral  blood samples  will  be  obtained in all patients  al 
baseline then weeks  2, [ADDRESS_914833] panel  
of antigens  (seromi cs). Flow cytometry  may be perfonned  for peripheral  blood  immune  cell phenotype and 
their activation status,  including CDS+  T-cells,  CD4+  T-<:ells,  Tregs,  and MDSCs.  The amount  of PDL-[ADDRESS_914834]  speci fic tumor  antigens  will be correlated with clinical  outcome  in an 
exploratory  manner  in order  to identify  predictiw  makers  for response,  and to further  our understand ing of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab plus RT,  and durvalumab and tremelimumab plus ablation in CRC.

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
• The primary objective is Overall  Response  Rate  in disease that is not ablated  or radiated  of 
durvalumab and tremelimumab  plus RT or durvalumab  and treme limumab  plus ablation  in 
subjects  with metastatic  CRC,  according to RECIST v1.1.  A response in a non- ablated  or 
non-radiated lesion is an abscopal  effect.  
• The secondary  objectives are to determine:  
o Safety  and tolerabi lity of durvalumab and treme limumab plus RT or ablation 
o Overall  Survival  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab  plus RT or ablation  
o Progression free survival rate at 1 year  
o Progression  free survival  rate at 2 years

• The exploratory  objectives  are to evaluate biomarkers  that may correlate  with actMty  of 
durval umab  and treme limumab  plus RT or ablation in CRC,  or prospect ively identify  CRC  
patients likely to respond to treatment.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_914842]  tumors  are one of the body's  natural  defenses  against  the 
growth  and proliferation of cancer cells.  However,  over time and under  pressure  from i'nmune 
attack,  cancers  devel op strategies  to evade  immune -medi ated killing  allowing  them  to develop  
unchecked.  One such  mechanism  involves upregul ation of surface  prote ins that deliver  inhibitory 
signals  to cytotoxic  T cells.  Programmed  cell death ligand 1 (PO-L1) is one such  protein,  and is 
upregulated in a broad range of cancers  with a high frequency,  with up to BB%  expression  in some  
tumor  types.  In a number  of these  cancers,  including lung (Ml et al, 2011), renal  (Thompson  et al, 
2005;  Thompson  et al, 2006;  Krambeck  et al, 2007),  pancreatic  (Nomi  et al, 2007;  Loos  et al, 200B;  
Wang et al, 2010),  ovarian  cancer  (Hamanishi  et al, 2007),  and hematologic  malignancies  (Andorsky  
et al, 2011;  Brusa  et al, 2013)  tumor  cell expression of PO-L1 is associated  with reduced survival  
and an unfavorable  prognosis.  
 
Programmed  cell death  ligand [ADDRESS_914843] immune  system  tumor  response.  In the lymph  nodes,  PO-L1 on antigen-presenting cells binds  
to P0-1 or COBO  on activated  T cells and delivers  an inhibitory  signal  to the T cell (Keir et al, 200B;  
Park et al, 2010).  This results  in reduced  T-cell activation and fewer  activated  T cells in circul ation.  
In the tumor  microenvironment,  PO-L1 expressed on tumor  cells binds  to P0-1 and COBO  on  
activated  T cells reachi ng the tumor.  This delivers an inhibitory  signal to those  T cells,  prevent ing 
them  from killing  target  cancer  cells and protecting  the tumor  from immune  elimination (Zou and 
Chen, 200B).  
 
Immune  responses  directed  against  tumors  are  one  of  the  body's  natural  defenses  against 
the growth and proliferation of cancer  cells.  T cells  play a critical role in antitumor  immunity  and their 
infiltration and activity have  been linked  to improved prognos is in a number  of cancers  (Pages  et al, 
2010;  Nakano  et al, 2001;  Suzuki  et al, 2011; Burt  et al, 2011 ). Immune  evasion,  primarily  through  
suppression  of T-cell activity, is now recognized as one of the hallmarks  of cancer.  Such  evasion  
can occur  via a range  of mechanisms  including produ ction of suppressive cytokines  such  as IL-10, 
secretion of chemokines  and growth factors  that recruit  and sustai n suppressive regulatory  T cells

In genera l,tumor  response rates  to anti-CTLA -4 therapy  are low (-10%).  However,  in patients who 
respond,  the responses  are generally  durab le, lasting several  months  even  in patients with 
aggressive tumors  such  as refractory  metastatic  melanoma.  Because  these  agents  work  through  
activation of the immune  system  and not by [CONTACT_676584],  responses  can occur  late 
and some  patients  may have perceived  progression of their disease  in advance of devel opi[INVESTIGATOR_676544] a tumor  response.  In some  cases, early  growth of pre-existi ng lesions or the 
appearance of new lesions may have  been due to immune -cell infiltration into the tumor  and not 
due to proliferati on and extension of neoplasti c cells,  per se (Wolchok  et al,2009).  Overall,  
although the impact  on convent ionally -defined  PFS can be small,  durab le response or stable 
disease seen in a proport ion of patients  can lead to significant  prolongation of OS. The melanoma

Durva lumab  is a human monoc lonal antibody  {mAb}  of the immunogl obulin G {lgG}  1 kappa  
subc lass that inhibits binding  of PD-L1 and is being deve loped  by [CONTACT_38227]/Med  Immune  for use 
in the  treatment  of  cancer.  (Medlmmune   is  a wholly  owned  subsi diary  of  [COMPANY_008];  
[COMPANY_008]/Medl  mmune  will be referred  to as [COMPANY_008] throughout  this document.}  As 
durvalumab is an engineered mAb,  it does  not induce antibody -dependent  cellul ar cytotoxicity  or 
compl ement -dependent   cytotoxicity. The  proposed  mechanism   of action  for  durvalumab  is 
interference of the interaction  of PD-L1. 
 
PD-L1 is expressed in a broad  range  of cancers  with a high frequency,  up to 88% in some  types  of 
cancers.  In a number  of these  cancers,  including lung, the express ion of PD-L1 is assoc iated with 
reduced survival  and an unfavorab le prognos is.  In lung cancer,  only 12% of patients with tumors  
expressi ng PD-L1 survived  for more than 3 years,  compared with 20% of patients with tumors  
lacking PD-L1 (Mu et al 2011.). Based on these findings,  an anti-PD-L1 antibody  could be used  
therapeutically  to enhance anti-tumor  immune  responses  in patients with cancer.  Results  of several  
non-clinical studies  using  mouse tumor  models  support  this hypothesis,  where  antibodi es directed  
against  PD-L1 or its receptor  PD-1 showed anti-tumor  activity  {Hirano et al 2005,  lwai et al 2002,  
Okudaira et al 2009,  Zhang et al 2008.).  
 
Durvalumab has been  given  to humans  as part of ongoing  studies  as a single drug or in combination  
with other  drugs.  As of the DCO  dates  {15Apr2015  to 12Ju l2015,  durva lumab  IB Version  9.0), a total

As of 09Feb2015,  PK data were  available for 378 subjects  in the dose -esca lation and dose-  
expansion phases  of Study  CD-ON-durvalumab -1108 following treatment  with durvalumab  0.1 to 
10 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  (Q2W)  or 15 mg/kg  every  3 weeks  (Q3W).  The maximum  observed  
concentration  (Cmax) increased in an approximately  dose- proport ional manner  over the dose range  of 
0.1 to 15 mg/kg.  The area under  the concentration -time curve  from 0 to 14 days  (AUCo.1•)  increased  
in a greater  than dose -proportional  manner  over the dose range of 0.1 to 3 mg/kg  and increased 
dose- proportionally  at <!: 3 mg/kg.  These  results  suggest  durval umab exhibits  nonlinear  PK likely due 
to saturabl e target -mediated CL at doses  < 3 mg/kg  and approaches  linearity at doses  <!: 3 mg/kg.  
Near compl ete target  saturation  (soluble programmed  cell death  ligand  1 [sPD -L1] and membrane 
bound}  is expected  with durvalumab <!: 3 mg/kg  Q2W.  Exposures  after multiple  doses  showed

simu lations indicate that followi ng durvalumab  10 mg/kg Q2W  dosing,  > 90% of subjec1s  are 
expected  to maintain PK exposure <!: 40 µg/mL  throughout  the dosing interval.  
 
As of 09Feb2015,  a total of 388 subjects  provided samples  for ADA  analysis.  Only 8 of 388 subjects  
([ADDRESS_914848]  each in 0.1, 1, 3, and 15 mg/kg cohorts,  and 4 subjec1s  in 10 mg/kg cohort)  were ADA

Tremelimumab is an lgG [ADDRESS_914851]  the cytotoxi c T-lymphocyte - 
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) also known as CD152  (cluster  of differenti ation 152).  This is an 
immunomodul atory  therapy  (IMT) that is being devel oped by [CONTACT_676585].  
Binding of CTLA -4 to its target  ligands  (B7-1 and B7-2) provides  a negat ive regul atory  signal , which  
limits  T-cell activation.  Anti-CTLA -4 inhibitors antagonize the binding of CTLA -4 to B7 ligands  and 
enhance human  T-cell activation as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_676586] (interleukin  [IL]-2 and 
interferon [IFN] gamma)  production  in vitro in whole blood or peripheral  blood mononuc lear cell 
(PBMC)  cultures  (Tarh ini and Kirkwood  2008. ). In addit ion, blockade  of CTLA -[ADDRESS_914852] ion of protective anti- 
tumor  immunity.  (Refer  to the treme limumab IB, Edition 5.0, for more  information.)  Therefore,  it is 
expected that treatment  with an anti-CTLA -4 antibody,  such as tremelimumab,  will lead to increased 
activation of the human  immune  system,  increas ing anti-tumor  activity in patients  with solid tumors.  
An extensive program  of non-clinical  and clinical studies  has been conducted  for tremelimumab  both 
as monotherapy  and combination therapy  with conventional  anticancer  agents  to support  various  
cancer indicat ions using different  dose schedul es.  As of the data cut-off date of 12 November  2014

The profil e of AEs and the spectrum  of event  severity  have remained stable across  the

post-surgery  metastatic  disease occurs  in 40%-60% of patients and the prognosis  for patients who 
develop advanced  metastatic  disease  is poor.  Over  the past decade,  progress  has been  made in the 
role of system ic therapy  for the palliat ion of advanced colorectal  cancer. With the introduction  of 
oxalip latin, irinotecan,  anti-VEGF  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  and anti-EGFR  therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], the median  life expectan cy of 
patients has  been  increased to about  29 months  (Meyerhardt  and Mayer  2005).  Desp ite these  
therapeuti c advances,  patients  with unresectable,  metastatic  and/or  recurrent  CRC,  remain  
incurabl e. There is a substantial  unmet  medi cal need  for more  effective and less toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  
especially  for those patients  with advanced disease that have not responded or have become  
resistant  to the existing standard treatments.  The development  of novel  approaches  to treatment  is

blockade with tremelimumab  (15 mg/kg every  90 days)  in 47 patients  with previously  treated CRC.  
Grade  3/4 treatment -related adverse  events  (PE.s)  included diarrhea  (n = 5; 11%), ulcerat ive colitis 
(n = 1; 2%),  fatigue (n = 1; 2%),  autoimmune thrombocytopeni  a (n = 1; 2%),  and hypokal emia (n = 1;

discont inuation).  Twenty -one patients (45%)  lived 180 days  after enrollment.  One patient (2%;  
90% Cl, < 1% to 10%)  had a stable pelvic mass  and substantial  regression in an adrenal  mass

observed in one patient  (Brahmer,  Drake  et al. 2010,  Topalian,  Hodi et al. 2012,  Lipson,  Sharfman  et

[IP_ADDRESS] PD/L -1 and CTLA- 4 Comb ination Therapy  in Colorectal  Cancer  
 
Comb ination immune  augmentation,  including anti-PD/L -1 plus anti-CTLA -4, is being studied in 
patients  with CRC.  One isolated response has been observed,  similar  to resul 1s of PD/L -1 blockade 
or CTLA -4 blockade  alone.  Checkmate -142 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is an ongoing study  of nivolumab  plus 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_676548].  One response was observed out of 20 patients.  10 MSS  colorectal  patients  were  
treated  with nivolumab  1 mg/kg  +ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  3 mg/kg,  and 10 MSS  colorectal  patients were  treated  
with nivolumab 3 mg/kg  + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  1 mg/kg.  Toxic ities were  cons istent  with other  studies of this 
combination therapy  (Overman,  Kopetz  et al. 2016).  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (IRB#13 -198) is an ongoing  
study  of durvalumab plus tremelimumab  in multiple tumor  types,  including CRC (n=15).  This study  is 
ongoing and results  have not yet been reported.  
 
3.6.[ADDRESS_914876]  is that  in situ tumor  destruction releases  a large amount  of tumor 
antigens.  Antigen- presenti  ng cells,  such  as dendritic  cells,  then take up these antigens  in the 
periphery  and migrate  to lymph  nodes  where they activate CD4+  and CDS+  T-lymphocytes  that 
recogni ze these  tumor -antigens.  Immune  augmentation via immune  co-stimu latory  molecules then 
permits  the ensui ng immune response to strengthen and destroy  cancer.  
 
The combination of tumor  cryoablation  and immunomodulation has been shown in animal  models,  
by [CONTACT_460577],  to generate  such  a systemic anti-tumor  response  (Waitz,  Fasso  et al. 2012).  
Specifically,  local tumor  destruction with cryoab lation can lead to exposure of DCs with suffic ient 
quant ities of tumor  antigens  to ultimately  lead to DC maturation and activation.  Recently,  our 
collaborators  ([CONTACT_676631]'s  group  at MSKCC)  showed  that combi nation therapy  with 
cryoablation and CTLA4 blockade successfully  medi ated rejection  of metastatic  prostate  cancer  
lesions  and prevented  the growth  of secondary  tumors  in preclin ical murine  mode ls (Waitz, Fasso et 
al. 2012).  Levy  et al. from MSKCC  showed in a BALB/c  mouse model  of metastatic  colon cancer  
that cryoablation of a solitary  tumor  mass  plus cyclophosphamide,  to selecti vely depletes  regulatory  
T cells  (Tregs),  leads  to regress ion of established tumors  and protect ion against tumor  rechallenge 
(Levy,  Sidana  et al. 2009).  Den Brok et al. have  also demonstrated  this effect  in vAlo using the well- 
defined murine B16-0VA melanoma cell line using RFA They  demonstrated that RFA alone resul ts

received control  antibody  plus ablation  alone (den Brok,  Sutmuller  et al.  2004).  
 
A similar effect  has been shown  with RT and blockade of PD-1/PDL -[ADDRESS_914878]  of RT in a fl..1C38  colorectal  tumor  model,  with 
substantial  delay  in tumor  growth 34 days  after treatment  with combination therapy.  Tumors  
measured  27.85  (± 27.85)  mm after canbination therapy,  compared to 278.6 (± 94.20) mm and 
457.6 (± 44.24)  mm after RT alone, or anti-PDL-[ADDRESS_914879]  was associated  with 
activation  of COB+  T-cells and reduced  tumor -infiltrating  myeloid -derived  suppressor  cells (MDSC)  
(Deng,  Liang et al.  2014). 
 
More  recently,  [CONTACT_676632]  from our group reported this abscopal  effect  in a patient  who developed  a 
system ic response to localized RT after having  had disease progress ion while recei ving CTLA -4 
blockade (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  Specifically,  a right hilar lymph -node  and spleen metastases,  which were  not 
the target  of RT, showed  regression  only after the patient  received  palliative  RT after several  months  
of CTLA -4 blockade.  A delayed  response to  the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_676549]  (Postow, 
Callahan et al. 2012).  
 
The preclinical  models  and the clinical  observation provide compelling  rationale  to further  study  
tumor  ablation and RT in combi nation with immune  augmentation by [CONTACT_3252]-stimulatory  blockade.  
 
CRC is an appropriate  target  for such  a study  because this disease  is (1) frequently  associated  with 
Tumor  Infiltrating  Lymphocytes  (Tlls), is (2) routinel y treated with combinat ion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676550],  and (3) there is substantial  unmet  need for novel  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676551] c therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
A study  of  RT  or ablation,  plus single agent  pembrolizumab  (PD-1 blockade)  alone is ongoing at 
MSKCC  in metastatic  CRC (IRB #15-069/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Initial resul ts have been presented  at 
ASCO  and showed that PD-1 blockade has a manageable  safety  profile  when administered  in 
combination with either RT or ablation in patients  with mCRC.  Grade  1-2 drug-related  AEs occurred 
in 95% and 75% of patients  who received RT or ablation,  respectively.  There were  no grade [ADDRESS_914880] ablati on or cryoablation  plus pembrolizumab (no 
patients  underwent  RFA).  Pembrolizumab plus RT showed modest  clinical activity in pMMR  CRC,  
with one partial  response  and two mixed  responses  (Segal  et al. ASCO  2016 #3539).  
 
The current  study  is invest igating whether  the CTLA4 plus PDL-[ADDRESS_914881] additive or 
synergistic  activity  in combination with tumor  ablation or radiation therapy.

The durval umab + treme limumab  doses  and regimen selected  for this study are  based  on the goal of 
selecting  an optimal  combination dose  of durvalumab and tremelimumab that would yield sustained  
target  suppression (sPD -L1), demonstrate  promising  efficacy,  and have  an acceptable safety  profile.  
 
In order  to reduce the dosing frequen cy of durvalumab to align with the q4w dosing of 
tremelimumab,  while  ensuring an acceptable PK/PDx,  safety,  and efficacy  profil e, cohorts  were  
narrowed  to 20 mg/kg durvalumab q4w.  PK simul ations  from the durval umab monotherapy  data 
indicated that a similar area under  the plasma  drug concentration -time curve  at steady  state  (AUC••; 
4 weeks)  was expected  following  both 10 mg/kg q2w and 20 mg/kg  q4w durval umab. The observed  
durvalumab  PK data from the D4190C00006 study  were  well in line with the predicted monotherapy  
PK data developed preclinically.  This demonstrates  similar  exposure of durvalumab 20 mg/kg q4w 
and 10 mg/kg  q2w,  with no alterations  in PK when durvalumab and tremelimumab  (doses  ranging 
from 1to 3 mg/kg)  are dosed together.  While  the median Cmax  at steady  state  (Cmax,ss)  is expected  to 
be higher  with 20 mg/kg  q4w (approximately  1.5 fold) and median  trough concentration  at steady  
state  (Cirough,ss)  is expected  to be higher with 10 mg/kg q2w (approx imatel y 1.25 fold),  this is not 
expected to impact  the overall  safety and efficacy  profile, based on exist ing preclinical and clinical 
data.  
 
l'vbnotonic  increases  in PDx activity  were observed with increas ing doses  of treme limumab  relative  
to the activity observed in patients treated with durvalumab monotherapy.  There was evidence of 
augmented  PDx activity relative to durvalumab monotherapy  with combination doses  containing  1 
mg/kg treme limumab,  inclusive of both the 15 and 20 mg/kg  durval umab plus 1 mg/kg  
tremelimumab  combi nations. 
 
Patients treated  with doses  of tremelimumab  above 1 mg/kg had a higher  rate of adverse events  
(AEs),  including discont inuations due to AEs,  serious  AEs (SAEs),  and severe  AEs.  Between  the 
10 mg/kg  durval umab  + 1 mg/kg treme limumab and 10 mg/kg  durva lumab  + 3 mg/kg  treme li'numab 
cohorts  treated  at the q2w schedule,  the number  of patients reporting  any AE, Grade  3 AEs,  SAEs,  
and treatment -related AEs was higher in the 10 mg/kg  durvalumab + 3 mg/kg  tremelimumab  cohort  
than the 10 mg/kg  durvalumab + 1 mg/kg treme limumab cohort.  A similar pattern was noted in the 
q4w regimens,  suggest ing that, as the dose  of treme limumab  increased  above 1 mg/kg,  a higher 
rate of treatment -related events  may be anticipated.  Further,  the SAEs  frequently  attributed  to 
immunotherapy,  pneumoni tis and colitis, were  more  commonly  seen  in cohorts  using either  3 or 10 
mg/kg  of treme limumab  compared  to the 1-mg/kg  dose cohorts.  Together,  these  data suggest  that a 
combination using a tremelimumab  dose of 1 mg/kg appeared to minimize  the rate of toxicity  when 
combined  with durvalumab.  As  a  result,  all combination  doses  utilizi ng either  the 3 or 10 mg/kg  
doses  of treme limumab were  eliminated in the final dose  selection. 
 
In contrast,  cohorts  assess ing higher  doses  of durval umab with a constant  dose of treme li'numab 
did not show  an increase in the rate of AEs.  The data suggested that increasing  doses  of 
durvalumab  may not impact  the safety  of the combi nation as much as the tremelimumab  dose.  
Further,  safety  data between the 10-mg/kg and 20-mg/kg  cohorts  were  similar,  with no change  in 
safety  events  with increasing  dose  of durvalumab.

In Study  D4190C00006,  of all treatment  cohorts,  the cohort  of 11 patients  treated in the 20 mg/kg  
durvalumab  + 1 mg/kg tremelimumab  group had the fewest  AEs,  Grade  <!:3 AEs,  SAEs,  and 
treatment  discontinuations  due to AEs,  but still showed  strong  evidence of clinical actMty. This 
cohort  had a lower  number  of treatment -related Grade <!:3 AEs or  treatment -related SAEs.  No dose-  
limiting toxicities were  reported.  
 
Preliminary  clinical activity  of the durval umab  and treme limumab combi nation did not appear  to 
change with increas ing doses  of treme limumab.  The 15- and 20-mg/kg  durva lumab  q4w cohorts  
demonstrated objective responses  at all doses  of tremelimumab,  and increasi ng doses  of 
tremelimumab  did not provide deeper  or more  rapid  responses.  
 
Efficacy  data suggested  that the 20 mg/kg  durva lumab + 1 mg/kg  treme limumab  dose  cohort  may 
demonstrate  equivalent  clinical  activity to other  dose  combinations.  A total of 5 of 11 patients  in the 
20 mg/kg  durval umab  + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab  cohort  were  evaluable for efficacy  with at least 8 
weeks  of follow- up. Of these,  there  were  2 patients  (40%)  with partial  response (PR),  1 patient  
(20%)  with stable disease (SD),  and 1 patient  (20%)  with progressive  disease (PD).  (The fifth 
patient  had only a single scan,  which  was conducted outside the window  for these  evaluations.)  
 
Additionally,  of all cohorts,  the 20 mg/kg  durvalumab + 1 mg/kg  tremelimumab dose cohort  had the 
fewest  AEs,  Grade  <!:3 AEs,  SAEs,  and treatment  discontinuations  due to AEs,  but still showed some  
evidence of clinical actMty.  All together,  the data suggested  that a 20 mg/kg  durva lumab  + 1 mg/kg  
tremelimumab  dose combination should be selected for further  development.  
 
3.7.1  Rationale  for 4 cycles of combination therapy  followed  by [CONTACT_676591]- term  follow  up on  melanoma  patients   treated  with  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],   an  anti-CTL.A4  targeting  
antibody  (dosed every  3 weeks  [q3w]  for 4 doses  and then discontinued) , shows  that patients  
respondi ng to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_676552]-term  benefit,  with a 3-year OS rate of approximatel y 22%.  
Furthermore,  the survival  curve  in this popul ation  reached a plateau at 3 years  and was  maintained  
through  10 years  of follow up (Schadendorf  et al 2013.).  
 
Similar  data have been  presented  for other anti -PD-1/PD -L 1 targeting  antibodies:  
 
Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) was dosed q2w for up to 96 weeks  in a large Phase I dose- escal ation and 
expansion study,  and showed responses  were maintained for a median  of 22.94 months  for 
melanoma (doses  0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg),  17 months  for NSCLC (doses  1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), and  
12.9 months  for renal  cell carcinoma patients (doses  1 and 10 mg/kg)  at the time of data analysis 
(Hodi  et al 2014,  Brahmer  et al 2014,  Drake  et al 2013.).  Furthermore,  responses were  maintained 
beyond treatment  discontinuation in the majority  of patients  who stopped nivolumab  treatment  
(either due to protocol  specified  end of treatment,  complete response [CR],  or toxicity)  for up to 
56 weeks  at the time of data analysis  (Topalian  et al 2014.).  
 
lltPDL3280a (anti-PD-L 1) and the combinat ion of nivolumab with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  in which patients were  
dosed for a finite  time period and responses  maintained beyond treatment  discontinuation have 
been reported (Herbst  et al 2013,  Wolchok  et al 2013.).

Similar long term results may be expected  with use of other  immune- mediated cancer  therapeut ics 
including anti-CTLA -4 antibod ies such  as tremelimumab,  anti PD-L1antibod ies such  as durva lumab,  
or the combination of the two. 
 
3.7.2 Fixed  dosing for durvalumab and tremelimumab  
 
A popul ation PK model  was developed for durvalumab using  monotherapy  data from a Phase 1 
study  (study  1108;  N=292;  doses=  0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W  or 15 mg/kg  Q3W;  solid  tumor s). 
Popul ation PK analys is indicated  only minor  impact  of body  weight (WT)  on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient  of s 0.5). The impact  of body  WT-based  (10 mg/kg  Q2W)  and f1JCed dosing  (750 mg 
Q'Z!N)  of durvalumab was evaluated  by [CONTACT_676592]  (51 
median and 951 percentiles)  using  the population  PK model.  A fixed  dose of 750 mg was selected  to 
approximate 1O mg/kg  (based  on median  body  WT of -75 kg). A total of [ADDRESS_914882]  variability  with fixed  dosing  regimen.  
 
Similarly, a population PK model  was deve loped  for treme limumab us ing data from Phase  1 through 
Phase 3 (N=654;  doses=  0.01 to 15 mg/kg Q4W or Q90D;  metastatic  melanoma)  [Wang et al. 2014]. 
Population  PK model  indicated  minor  impact  of body  WT on PK of tremelimumab  (coefficient of s 
0.5). The WT-based (1 mg/kg  Q4W)  and f1JCed dosing (75 mg/kg  Q4W;  based  on median body  WT of 
-75 kg) regimens  were  compared  using  predicted   PK concentrations  (51 median   and  951 
percentiles)  using population PK model  in a simulated population  of [ADDRESS_914883] been reported by [CONTACT_2312]  [Ng et al 2006,  Wang et al. 2009,  Zhang et al, 
2012, Narwal  et al 2013]. Wang and colleagues  investigated  [ADDRESS_914884]  variabi lity in 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics  parameters  [Zhang et al 2012].  
 
A fixed  dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_62648].  Given expectat ion of similar  pharmacokinet ic exposure  and variability, we considered 
it feasible to switch  to fixed  dosing regimens.  Based on average body WT of 75 kg, a fixed  dose of 
750 mg Q2W lllEDl4736 (equival ent to 10 mg/kg  Q2W),  1500 mg Q4W  durvalumab (equivalent  to 
20 mg/kg  Q4W)  and 75 mg Q4W tremelimumab  (equi valent to 1 mg/kg  Q4W)  is included in the 
current  study.  
 
Fixed dosing of durva lumab and treme limumab  is recanmended only for subjects  with > 30kg  body  
weight due to endotox in exposure.  Patients with a body  weight  less than or equal  to 30 kg shou ld 
be dosed using a weight -based  dosing  schedule.

4.2 Design  
 
This will be a Simon  two-stage  design,  phase II study.  It will be conducted to determine the efficacy  
and safety  of (1) durvalumab and tremelimumab  plus RT in subjects  with metastatic  CRC who are 
undergoi ng RT as standard therapy;  and, (2) durvalumab  and tremelimumab plus ablation  in 
subjects  with metastatic CRC who are undergoing ablation as standard therapy.  
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients will be stratified  accordi ng to eligibility for RT (cohort  1) or ablation (cohort  2). Patients in 
cohort  [ADDRESS_914885].  All subjects  will undergo ablation or begin RT within  7 days  after 
starting durvalumab and tremelimumab.  
 
Subjects  will receive durvalumab and tremelimumab  every  four weeks  (Q4W),  for 4 months,  and 
then continue durval umab  every  four weeks  (Q4W) until confirmed progression of disease,  initiation 
of alternative cancer  therapy,  unacceptable toxici ty, or other  reasons  to discontinue treatment  occur.  
Patients who had a prior response,  continued  on durvalumab monotherapy  and did not discontinue  
treme limumab due to toxicity  may,  after discussi on with the Princ ipal Investigator,  continue 
treatment  beyond disease progression with either durval umab monotherapy  or resume  combination  
therapy  with tremelimumab plus durvalumab for [ADDRESS_914886]  cases.  Repeat  
palliat ive RT or ablation may include measurab le index  lesion(s)  that is (are)  being followed  for 
response measureme n1s if at least one index  lesions  remains  to be followed.  Patients will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_676593] [ADDRESS_914887]  1.1. 
Subjects  with evidence of disease progression  during the durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination 
portion of the treatment  regimen may continue to receive durvalumab and tremelimumab  beyond  
radiographi c disease progression in the absence of clinical deterioration,  and after discussion  with 
the Princ ipal Investigator.  
 
All subjects  will be followed  for [ADDRESS_914888]  of this therapy  wil Ibe performed  in patients using  research blood  
draws  (all patients),  and tumor  biopsy  at basel ine, one week  after completing radi ation/ablat ion and

Radiotherapy  (RT} will be performed  using external  beam  ionizing radiation as standard  therapy  in 
accordance with institutional standard  pract ice. 
 
RT will be initiated within [ADDRESS_914891].  
 
Target  volumes  for RT will be defined in accordance with Internat ional Commission on Radiation

The target  lesion for RT will be defined  as the gross  tumor  volume (GTV}.  The clinical  target  volume 
(CTV}  will be the same as the GTV.  The planning  target  volume (PTV}  will be a minimum  volumetric

[IP_ADDRESS]  Durvalumab  + tremelimumab  combination  therapy  
 
Patients will receive  1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses/cycles  and 75 mg 
treme limumab via IV infusion q4w for up to 4 doses /cycles, and then continue [ADDRESS_914909] 
cycle,  subsequent  infusion observation periods  can be at the Investigator's  discretion  (suggested  30 
minutes  after each  durval umab and treme limumab  infus ion). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration  of treatment  and criteria for retreatment  
Retreatment  with durvalumab + tremelimumab is allowed  {once  only)  for patients  meeting  the 
retreatment  criteria  below.  The same trea1ment  guidelines  followed  during the initial treatment  
period will be followed  during the retreatment  period,  including  the same  dose and frequency  of 
treatments  and the same schedule of assessments.  
 
Patients  receiving  durvalumab  monotherapy  may undergo  retreatment  with  the combination  of 
durvalumab  + tremelimumab,  described below:  
 
1. Patients  who complete the 4 dosing C}Cles  of the combination of durvalumab and 
tremelimumab  portion of the regimen {with  clinical benefit  per Invest igator  judgment),  but 
subsequently  have  evidence of PD  during  the durvalumab monotherapy  portion of the 
combination regimen,  with or without  confirmation according to RECI ST 1.1, may restart 
treatment  with the combination.  
 
Before restart ing their assigned treatmen t, the  Investigator  shoul d ensure  that the patient:  
 
1. Does  not have  any significant,  unacceptabl e, or irrevers ible toxicities that indicate continui ng 
treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient 
 
2. Still fulfills the eligibility  criteria for this study,  including re-consenting to restart  durvalumab  
and tremelimumab

3. Has had a base line tumor  assessment  within 28 days  before restart ing their assigned  
treatment;  all further  scans shoul d occur  with the same frequency  as during  the initial months  
of treatment  until study treatment  is stopped  
 
During  the retreatment  period, patients receiving durvalumab  + tremelimumab  may resume  
durval umab dosing at [ADDRESS_914910] dose of combinat ion therapy.  
 
Treatment  through  progression is at the Investigator's  discretion,  and the Invest igator  shoul d ensure  
that patients do not have  any significant,  unacceptable,  or irrevers ible toxicities  that indicate that 
continuing  treatment  will not further  benefit  the patient.  A patient  with a confirmed progression  
receiving durvalumab + tremelimumab  cannot  continue  therapy  or obtain retreatment  if dosing  is 
ongoing in the combi nation portion of therapy  {q4w  dosing) and progression occurs  in a target  lesion 
that has previously  shown a confirmed  response.  
 
Patients who the Invest igator  determ ines may  not continue treatment  will enter  follow- up.

9.3 Dose  Modification  and Toxicity  Management  
 
Durvalumab  and tremelimumab  
For adverse  events  (AEs) that are  cons idered at least part ly due to admi nistration  of durva lumab the 
follow ing dose adjustment  guidance may be applied: 
 
• Treat  each of the toxici ties with maximum supportive  care (including  holding  the agent  
suspected of causing the toxicity where  required).  
• If the symptoms promptly  resolve  with supportive  care,  consi derati on should be given to 
continui ng the same  dose  of durvalumab or tremelimumab  along  with appropriate continuing  
supportive care.  If medically  appropriate,  dose modifications  are permitted for durvalumab  
and tremelimumab  (see Appendix  A). 
• All dose  modifications  should be documented  with clear reasoning and documentation of the 
approach taken.  
 
In addition, there are certa in circumstances  in which durva lumab  or tremelimumab  shou ld be 
permanently  disconti nued.  
 
Followi ng the first dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab,  subsequent  administration of durvalumab 
or tremelimumab  can be modified  based on toxici ties observed (see Appendix  A).  Dose reductions  
are not permi tted. 
 
Based on the mechan ism of action  of durvalumab or tremel imumab  leading to T-cell activat ion and 
proliferation,  there is the possibil ity of observing immune related Adverse  Events  (irAEs)  during the 
conduct  of this study.  Potent ial irAEs include immune -mediated enterocol itis, dermatit is, hepat itis,

9.5   Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Term ination 
 
Early  trial termination  will be the result  of the criteria  specified below:  
 
1.  Quality or quant ity of data record ing is inaccurate  or incomplete  
 
2. Poor  adherence to protocol  and regulatory  requirements  
 
3. Incidence  or severity  of adverse  drug react ion in this or other  studies indicates  a potential  health 
hazard to subjects  
 
4. Plans to modify  or discontinue  the development  of the study  drug  
 
In the even t of Med Immune/ Astra Zeneca decision to no longer  supp ly study  drug,  ample 
notificati on will be provided so that appropriate  adjustments  to subject  treatment  can be made.  
9.7 RESEARCH  BLOOD  AND  BIOPSY SPECIMENS 
 
9.7.1  Research  blood  
 
For all patients,  blood specimens  will be obtained for research purposes  during screeni ng or on day 
1,then at weeks  2, 4 and 8 (± 3 days).  An addit ional blood draw beyond  week  [ADDRESS_914926] ing clinic/immunological  findings. 
Specimens  should  be collected prior to drug administration.  Four  (4) tubes  of blood are to be 
collected in BD Vacutainer®  CPT™ Cell  Preparation  Tubes  with Sodium  Heparin.  Each  tube should  
contain approximately  10 cc of blood. Peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells and plasma  will then be 
isolated per  institutional  practice  in the Immune l'v'on itoring  Facility  (IMF). 
9.7.[ADDRESS_914927] eting  radiation  or ablation (from  the radiated/  
ablated lesion), and then 4 weeks  after dose #1 of durvalumab  plus tremelimumab  (from  a non-  
radiated/  ablated lesion) 
 
Patients will be permitted to continue enrollment  and  treatment  on protocol  in the event  that 
insuffic ient material  was obtained from the biopsy.  The on treatment  biopsy  will not be required if this 
is no longer  considered appropriate  at the time of the planned procedure,  for exampl e, if the tumor  is 
no longer  access ible or the procedure  is deemed to be unsafe.  Tumor  lesion planned for on- 
treatment  biopsy  may be an index  lesion if ;:: [ADDRESS_914928] one diameter.  
If clinically practical, subjects  will undergo up to 5 core biopsies.  Three core biopsies  will be placed  
in forma lin and processed  for FFPE,  2 core biopsies will be immediately  frozen  in liquid nitrogen  and 
then stored at -80°C  (appendix  C). All tissue  obtai ned during biopsy procedures  will be sent to the 
IMF facility for analysis  under  this study  as  indicated  below.  If the  patient  undergoes  a routine 
procedure,  tissue  may be obtained  for future correlative  analyses.  
 
9.7.3  Correlati ve studies  
 
Pharmacodynamic  changes  may be evaluated  for associ ations  with clinical  activity,  and safety  
(adverse event)  data.  Tissue  may be used for corre lative  studies such  as IHC, tumor  mutat ion 
analysis, proteomi c analysis, and immunod iversity.  PDL- 1 immunoh istochemi stry will be done  by a

[IP_ADDRESS]  Whole  Blood  
 
Flow cytometry will be performed  at baseline and during treatment  to assess  baseline and changes  
in compos ition/act ivation status  of lymphocyte  subsets  present  in peripheral  blood mononuc lear cell 
preparations  (PBMCs).  Lymphocyte subsets  to be assayed  may include, but are not limited to CDS+  
and CD4+  T-cell subsets  (activated;  effector/memory;  regulatory)  and populations  of those cells as 
defined by [CONTACT_676600], exhaust ion, or signaling markers  such  as ICOS,  HLA-DR, 
PD-1, CTLA -4, and/or  intracellular  IFNy.  NK cell popul ations may be monitored in a similar  fashi on 
with a focus  on characterizing subsets  defined by [CONTACT_676601]  (e.g. NKG2D;  
IL-21R) and/or  by [CONTACT_676602] (e.g.,  
CD107a,  granzyme,  perforin).  Additional  flow cytometry- based assays  will focus  on defining and 
moni toring the abundance of myeloid -derived  suppressor  cells (l'vDSCs),  a cell type which  appears  
to negatively  impact  anti-tumor  actMty  and which  has been  shown to promote  immune  escape by 
[CONTACT_676603]  T-cell infiltration into the tumor  microenvironment  (Lesokhin,  Hohl et al. 2012).  
Immune  cells may be evaluated using HLA-A2-restricted  tetramer  assays  to detect  and quantify  the 
presence of T cells directed against  speci fic antigens  which  are antici pated to be presented to the 
immune  system  due to study  treatment. Detect ing on-treatment  increases  in these T cell popul ations  
may be considered evidence of adaptive immune  responses  in CRC.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plasma  
To understand  the preval ence of circu lating prote ins and the impact  they may have  on the clinical 
activity  and/or  safety  of durvalumab  and tremelimumab treatment,  the protein  concentrations  of a 
panel  of cytokines,  chemokines,  and other  relevant  immunomodul atory,  soluble factors  may be 
investigated by [CONTACT_159335]/or  other  relevant  multiplex-based protei n assay  methods.  Examp les of 
analytes to be assessed  may include but are not limited to factors  induced by [CONTACT_676604] (e.g.,  T 
cell chemoattractants  CXCL9;  CXCL10)  and other  factors  generally  involved in inflammatory  
processes.  Plasma  may be used also to assess  the presence and/or  concentration of anti-tumor  
antibodies  using a mulitplex platform  such  as lnvitrogen's  Protoarray  platform(c).  Level s of sPD-L1 
in peripheral  blood may also be assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tissue  Biopsies  and/or  archived  tissue  
 
The presence of TILs within  tumors  in response to durvalumab and tremelimumab  treatment  will be 
evaluated base line and on-treatment  biopsies.  Archived tissue  (approximatel y 20 x 5 µm slides) and 
biopsy  tissue  may be analyzed  using immunohi stochemistry  for PD-L1 express ion and other  
immune -related genes,  and gene express ion (microarray  and/or  RT- QPCR)  research  platforms. 
Laser  Capture  Microdissection may be utilized  to enrich specific  regions  of tumor  material  for use in 
similar or addit ional downstream  applications,  which may include in-situ hybridization, flow  
cytometry,  ELISA, and/or  assessment  of miRNA  In all cases, the  goal may be to determ ine the 
abundance of a battery  of immunoregul atory  genes  or proteins  associated with cancer  cells and/or

cancer-interacting lymphocytes derived from biopsied mater ial. DNA will be extracted from tumor  
samp les and normal  blood lymphocytes and undergo sequence analysis, such as whole exome  
seque ncing in order to (1) search  for tumor  mutati ons that may  corre late with immu ne response;  and 
(2) to search  for tumor spec ific mutations  that are absent  from germ  line DNA  and be potent ial novel 
immu ne targets, neo-epi [INVESTIGATOR_322].  Other  biomarkers may be evaluated as determined by [CONTACT_676605]. Remai ning spec imens may be stored for future studies related to CRC immun ity.

11.0  TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
 
11.1 SAFETY  MONITOR ING 
Subjects  will be evaluated for occurrence of AEs at each visit. Events  will be characterized and 
reported as described below.  Safety  will also be moni tored  by [CONTACT_676606].  
 
11.1.1 Adverse  Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Definitions  of AEs,  non-serious  AE, and serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  are provided in this section.  
Additionally,  provided in the sections  below  are reporting guidelines  for any AE or SAE occurring  
during this study.  
Definition of Adverse  Event  and Non-Serious Adverse  Event  
 
The following  definition of AE will be used for the study:  "Any untoward medical  occurrence in a 
subject  or clinical investigation subject  administered a pharmaceutical  product  and which does  not 
necessarily  have to have a causal  relationship with this treatment.  An adverse  event  can therefore  
be any unfavorabl e and unintended  sign (including an abnormal  laboratory  finding), symptom,  or 
disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal  (investigational)  product,  whether  or not 
related to medicinal  (investigational)  product."  
This definiti on includes  any abnormalities  or anomalies  that were  not seen at basel ine or which  
worsened during the course  of the study,  if present  at basel ine. 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  
IRB Number: 17-139 A(2) 
Approval  date:  09-0ct-2018  
Page  42 of 86  
  
 
A "non-serious"  adverse  event is any event  that does  not meet  the definition  of "serious  adverse  
evenf'  as presented,  below.  
 
Reporting  and Treating  Non-Serious Events  
 
It is the respons ibility of the invest igator  to perform  regular assessments  for AE.s.  Subjects  will be 
regularly  queried about  the occurrence of any AE.s  and will be monitored throughout  the study  for 
reactions  to study  drug and/or  study  procedures.  The investigator  and clinical staff will record all 
AE.s,  whether  volunteered by [CONTACT_303406],  at any time during a subject 's participat ion 
in the study.  Abnormal  laboratory  findings  (e.g.,  hematology,  comprehensive metabolic panel)  or 
other  abnormal  assessments  (e.g.,  vital signs)  will be recorded as AEs if they are judged as 
clinically significant  by [CONTACT_093].  
All subjects  experiencing  an AE will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_676607]/or  at an acceptabl e level. 
Unless  the event  requires  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (SAE),  medical  treatment  will be provided  to the subjects  at 
the unit and treatment  medication and/or  medical  procedures  will  be  provided  per  the treating-  
investigator's  clinical discretion.  All clinically  significant  AE.s,  including  clinically  significant  laboratory  
abnormal ities, will be followed  until resolution.  AE.s  meeting the defin ition of SAE.s  requi re spec ial 
reporting in addition to documentation in the CRDB  as described below.  
All AE.s,  including clinically significant  laboratory  and assessment  abnormalities  will be recorded  
according to "Common  Terminology  Criteria for Adverse  Events"  V4.03 (CTCAE)  and must  be 
recorded in the CRDB.  Events  occurring prior to initiation of first dose  shoul d be recorded on the 
Medi cal History  page of the CRDB.  Any AE occurring at initiation  of first dose  of study  drugs  shoul d 
be recorded  on the Adverse  Event  page  of the CRDB.  AE.s  should  be recorded in the CRDB  using  
the medical  terminology  found in the source  documentation.  Whenever  possible,  diagnoses  should  
be given  when  signs   and  symptoms  are  due  to  a common  etiology. It  is  the  investigator's  
responsibility  to provide his/her  assessment  of the relationship  of the event  to the study  drug and the 
severity  of the event  using  the followi ng scales:  
 
• Relationship  
> Unrelated:  The AE is clearly  attributable to a concurrent  illness,  concurrent  medi cation,  clinical 
state, or environmental  factor  other  than the invest igative agent.  
> Unlikely:  The occurrence of the AE does  not follow the study  in a temporal  sequence  and/or  
based upon available subject  informat ion, e.g., medi cal history,  disease process,  known  
pharmacology  of drug, a relationshi p between the drug and AE is unlikely.  
> Possible:  The AE follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from the time of study  drug 
administration,  but it is possibl e that other  factors; e.g., subject 's clinical state  or concomitant 
mediations, environmental  factors,  or the drug's  pharmacology  may have  caused the AE. 
> Probable:  The AE follows  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from the time of study  drug 
administration,  follows  a known  response  pattern  of the medication class,  and cannot  be 
reasonably  explained  by [CONTACT_40131].

• Severity  
 
The severity  of all adverse events  should  be graded according to the Common  Terminology  Criteria 
for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  V4.03. For those adverse  events  not listed in the CTCAE,  the 
following  grading system  should  be employed:  
> Mild (CTCAE  Grade 1): Trans ient symptoms,  awareness  of sign/symptom,  but easily  tolerated  
and no interference with subject 's daily activit ies 
> Moderate  (CTCAE  Grade  2):  Marked  signs/symptoms  that  interfere  with  subject's  usual 
activities,  but still acceptable 
> Severe (CTCAE  Grade  3): Incapacitating signs/symptoms  which cause  considerabl e interference 
with the subject 's daily activit ies, unacceptabl e 
> Ufa-threatening  (CTCAE  Grade 4):  Life-threateni ng of disabling AE 
> Death (CTCAE  Grade  5):  Death -related  AE.  See CTCAE  Guidelines for assigning Grade 5.  
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
 
The following  defini tion of SAE applies for the study:  "A serious AE means  any AE occurr ing at any 
dose that resul ts in any of the followi ng outcomes:  death,  a life-threateni ng AE, inpatient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_676559], a persistent  or significant  
disability/ incapac ity, or a congenital  anomal y/birth  defect.  Important  medical events  that may not 
result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767]  a serious  AE when,  
based upon appropriate  medical  judgment,  they may jeopardi ze the subject  or subject  and may 
require  medical  or surgical  interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition.  A life- 
threatening AE is any AE that places  the subject  or subject,  in the view of the investigator,  at 
immed iate risk of death from the react ion as it occurred (e.g., it does  not include a react ion that, had 
it occurred in a more  severe form,  might have caused death)."  Reporting and Treating Serious  
Adverse  Events  as per section 17.2. 
Recording Adverse events 
 
Adverse  events  will be recorded using  a recognized  medi::al  term or diagnosis  that accurately  
reflects  the event.  Adverse  events  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_676608], relationshi p to 
the investigational  product,  poss ible etiologies, and whether  the event  meets  criteria  of an SAE and 
therefore  requi res immed iate notification to [COMPANY_008]/Med  Immune  Patient Safety.  
 
The following  variables  will be collected for each  AE: 
 
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when  the AE started and stopped  
• Changes  in NCI CTCAE  grade and the maximum  CTC grade attained 
• Whether  the AE is serious  or not  
• Invest igator  causal ity rating against  durval umab or treme limumab  (yes or no) 
• Action  taken  with regard  to durval umab + treme limumab/comparator/combinati  on agent

AEs/SAEs,  is required to be reported within  24 hours  of knowledge of the event  to the 
A<;traZeneca/Medl  mmune Patient  Safety  or designee  using  the designated Safety  a-mailbox.  If the 
overdose  results in an AE, the AE must  also be recorded  as an AE. 
 
Study  recording  period  and follow -up for adverse events and serious adverse events  
Adverse events  and serious adverse events  will be recorded frCJTl  time of signature [CONTACT_676629],  throughout  the treatment  period and including the follow -up period ([ADDRESS_914935] 
dose of durvalumab or tremelimumab).  
 
During  the course  of the study  alIAEs and SAEs  should  be proactively followed  up for each subject.  
Every  effort  should  be made to obtain a resolution  for all events,  even if the events  continue  after 
disconti nuation/study compl etion.  
 
If a subject  discontinues  from treatment  for reasons  other  than disease progression,  and therefore  
continues  to have  tumor  assessments,  drug or procedure -related  SAEs  must  be captured  until the 
patient  is considered to have confirmed PD and will have  no further  tumor  assessments.  
 
The investi gator  is responsible for following  all SAEs  until resoluti on, until the subject  returns  to 
base line status, or until the condit ion has stabilized with the expectat ion that it will remai n chron ic, 
even  if this extends  beyond study  partici pation. 
 
All SAEs  will be reported,  whether  or not considered causally  related to the investi gational  product,  
or to the study  procedure(s).  The reporting  period  for SAEs  is the period immediately following the 
time that written  informed  consent  is obtained through  [ADDRESS_914936] dose  of durvalumab  or 
treme limumab  or until the initiation of alternative  anticancer  therapy.  The investigator  and/or  
Sponsor  are responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or  the Regul atory  Authority  of the

Hepatic function abnormality  
 
Hepat ic function abnormal ity (as defined in Section 11.3.) in a study  subject,  with  or  without  
associated clinical manifestations,  is required  to be reported as "hepatic  function  abnormal"  within  
24 hours  of knowledge  of the event  to the sponsor  and [COMPANY_008]/Med Immune Patient Safety  
using the designated  Safety  a-mailbox (see above for contact  [CONTACT_3031]),  unless a defin itive 
underlying diagnosis  for the abnormal ity (e.g., cholelithiasis  or bile duct obstruction)  that is unrelated  
to investi gational  product has  been confirmed.  
 
• If the defin itive underlying diagnos is for the abnormal ity has been establ ished  and is 
unrelated  to investigational  product,  the decision to continue dosing of the study  subject  will 
be based on the clinical judgment  of the invest igator.  
 
• If no definitive  underlying diagnosis  for the abnormality  is established,  dosing of the study  
subject  must  be interrupted  immed iately.  Follow -up investigations  and  inquiries  must  be 
initiated by [CONTACT_676610].

If a patient becomes  pregnant  during  the course  of the study,  the IPs shoul d be discontinued  
immed iately.  
 
Pregnancy  itself is not regarded  as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_676560] a contraceptive medi cation. Congeni tal abnormalities  or 
birth defects  and spontaneous  miscarriages  should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective  
abort ions without  compl ications shoul d not be handl ed as AEs.  The outcome  of all pregnanc ies 
(spontaneous  miscarriage,  elective  termination,  ectopic  pregnancy,  normal  birth, or congenital

11.3   Durvalumab  + tremelimumab  adverse events of special  interest  
 
An adverse  event of spec ial interest  (AESI ) is one of scientific and medical interest  specific  to 
understan ding of the lnvest igational Product  and may require close monitoring and rapid  
communication by [CONTACT_362979]. AA AESI  may be serious or non-serious. The 
rapid reporting of AES Is allows  ongo ing surveillance of these events  in order  to charact erize and 
understan d them in assoc iation with the use of this invest igational product. 
 
AESl s for durval umab and treme limumab  include but are not limited to events with a potential  
inflammat ory or immu ne-medi ated mechani sm and which may require more frequent monitoring 
and/or intervent ions such as steroids, immunosup pressants and/or  hormone replacement  therapy . 
These AESl s are being closely monitored  in clinical studi es with durval umab monothe rapy and 
combinat ion therapy.  AA immune- related adverse  event  (irAE) is defined as an adverse event  that is 
assoc iated with drug exposure  and is consistent  with an immu ne-medi ated mechan ism of action and 
where there is no clear alternate etiology. Sero logic, immun ologic, and histologic (biopsy) data,  as 
appropriate,  should  be used to support  an irAE diagnosis. Approp riate efforts  shoul d be made to rule 
out neoplastic,  infect ious, metabo lic, toxin,  or other  etiologic causes  of the irAE. 
 
If the Investigator  has any quest ions in regards to an  a dverse  event  (AE) being  an irAE, the 
Invest igator  shoul d promptly  contact  [CONTACT_676611]. 
 
AESl s observed  with durvalumab  and tremelimumab  include: 
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• M..T/AST  increases  I hepatitis I hepatotoxic ity 
• Neuropathy  I neuromuscul ar toxicity  (i.e. events of encephal itis, periphe ral motor  and 
sensory  neuropathies,  Guillain-Barre, and myasthe nia gravis)

• Endocrinopathy  (i.e.  events  of   hypophys itis,   adrenal  insuffic iency,   and   hyper -   and 
hypothyroi dism)  
• Dermatitis  
• Nephri tis 
• Pancreat itis   (or labs suggestive of pancreat itis - increased serum  lipase,  increased serum  
amylase)  
Further  information on these  risks (e.g. presenti ng symptoms)  can be found in the current version  of 
the durval umab  and tremelimumab  Investigator  Brochure.  For durval umab  and tremelimumab,  
AESls  will comprise the following:  
 
Pneumonitis  
AEs of pneumonit is are also of interest  for [COMPANY_008],  as pneumoni tis has been observed with 
use of anti-PD-1 mAbs  (but not with anti-PD-L 1 mAbs).  Initial work -up shoul d include a high-  
resolution CT scan,  ruling out infecti on, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary  consultation  is highly  
recommended.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune- related AEs (irAEs)  
including pneumonit is are provided in Appendix  A 
 
Infusion  reactions  
AEs of infusion react ions (also termed  infusion-related react ions) are of spec ial interest  to 
[COMPANY_008]  and are defined,  for the purpose  of this protocol , as all AEs occurring  fran the start of 
IP infus ion up to [ADDRESS_914943] been reported  with anti-PD-L 1 
and anti-PD-1 therapy  (Brahmer  et al, 2012. ).   As with the administration  of any foreign  protein  
and/or  other  biologic  agents,  reactions  following  the infusi on of mAbs  can be caused  by [CONTACT_362980],  including acute anaphy lactic (lgE-mediated)  and anaphylactoi d react ions against the 
mAbs  and serum  sickness.  Acute  allergic  reactions  may occur,  may be severe,  and may result  in 
death.  Acute  allerg ic react ions  may  include hypotens ion, dyspnea,  cyanos is, respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078], 
urticaria,  pruritus,  angioedema,  hypotonia,  arthralgia,  bronchospasm,  wheeze,  cough,  dizziness,  
fatigue,  headache,  hypertension,  myalgia,  vomiting,   and  unresponsiveness.  Guidelines   for  the 
management  of patients with hypersensi tivity (including anaphylactic  reaction)  and infusion -related  
reactions  are provided in Append ix A 
 
Hepatic function abnormalities  (hepatotoxicity)  
Hepat ic function abnormality  is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater  than [ADDRESS_914944].  Concurrent  findings are those  that 
derive from a single blood draw  or from separate  blood draws  taken  within  8 days  of each  other.  
Follow -up investigations  and inquiries will be initiated promptly  by [CONTACT_676612]/or  whether  there  is objective  evidence that 
clearly  supports  causation by a disease  (e.g., cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended  
gallb ladder)  or an agent  other  than the IP. Guidelines  for management  of patients with hepat ic 
function abnormal ity are provided in Appendix  A

Gastrointestinal  disorders 
Diarrhea/colitis  is the most  commonly  observed  treatment  emergent  SAE when tremelimLJTiab is 
used as monotherapy.  In rare cases,  colon perforat ion may occur  that requi res surgery  (colectomy)  
or can  lead to a fatal outcome if not proper ly managed.  Guidelines on management  of diarrhea  and 
colitis in patients  receiving tremelimumab  are provided  in Appendix  A 
Endocrine  disorders  
Immune -medi ated endocr inopathi es include hypophys itis, adrenal  insuffic iency,  and hyper - and 
hypothyroi dism.  Guidelines  for the management  of patients  with immune -mediated  endocrine  
events  are provided  in Appendix  A 
 
Pancreatic  disorders  
Immune -medi ated pancreatit is includes  autoimmune pancreat itis, and lipase  and amylase  elevation. 
Guidel ines for the management of  patients with immune -mediated pancreatic  disorders  are provided 
in Appendix  A 
 
Neirotoxicity  
Immune -medi ated nervous  system  events  include encephal itis, peripheral  motor  and sensory  
neuropathies,  Guillain-Barre,  and myastheni a gravis.  Guidelines for the management  of patients  
with immune- mediated  neurotoxic  events  are provided in Appendix  A 
Nephritis 
 
Immune -medi ated nephr itis includes  autoimmune  nephr itis, renal  dysfu nction, and elevated serum  
creatinine.  Guidelines for the management  of patients with immune- mediated nephr itis events  are 
provided in Append  ix A 
Immune- related adverse events  
Based on the mechani sm of action of durva lumab  and treme limumab  leading to T-cell activat ion and 
proliferation,  there is a possibil ity of observing irAEs  during the conduct  of this study . Potential  irAEs  
may be similar  to those  seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125],  BMS -936558  (anti-PD-1 mAb),  and BMS - 
936559 (anti-PD-L1 mAb}  and may  include immune- mediated  enterocol itis, dermat itis, hepatitis  
(hepatotoxi city), pneumonitis,  and endocrinopathies  (Hodi  et al 2010,  Brahmer  et al 2012,  Topal ian 
et al 2012.).  These  AEs are inflammatory  in nature and can affect  any organ.  With anti-PD-L 1 and 
anti-CTLA -4 combination therapy,  the occurrence of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_676561] . Patients  shoul d be moni tored  for signs and symptoms  of irAEs.  In the 
absence of an alternate  etiology   (e.g., infection  or PD), an immune -related etiology  should be 
cons idered  for signs or symptoms  of enterocol itis, dermatitis,  pneumoni tis, hepat itis, and 
endocr inopat hy. In addition to the dose  modif ication guidel ines provided in Appendix  A, it is 
recommended  that irAEs  are managed  according to the general  treatment  guidel ines outlined for 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  (Weber et al 2012.).  These  guidelines  recommend  the followi ng: 
• Patients shoul d be evaluated to identify any al ternative  etiology.

• In the absen ce of a clear alternative etiology, all events  of an inflammatory  nature shoul d be 
cons idered immune related.  
• Symptomatic  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_676562] d be considered for low-grade  events.  
• Systemic  corticosteroids  shoul d be considered for  a  persistent  low-grade  event  or for a

12.0 CRITERIA FOR  THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
For the purposes  of this study,  patients will be evaluated for response  every  2 cycles  (approximately  
8  weeks),   or  as  clincially  indicated  if  interim  toxicity  occurs  mandat ing  cancer  staging  re- 
assessment.  RECIST  1.[ADDRESS_914945].  abdomen.  and pelvis  
 
• CT scans  shoul d be performed with contiguous  cuts in slice thickness of [ADDRESS_914946] should be performed  using a 5-mm contiguous  reconstruction algorithm.  
II/RI scans  
 
• II/RI of the abdomen and pelvis is acceptabl e for measurement  of lesions provided that the 
same  anatomical  plane  is used  for serial  assessments.  If possible,  the same inaging device  
shoul d be used for serial evaluations.  In case  of II/RI, measurements  will be preferabl y 
performed  in the axial (transverse)  plane on contrast -enhanced  T1-weighted images.  However,  
there  are no specific  sequence recommendations.  
Measurability  of Tumor Lesions  
Tumor  lesions  will be categorized as follows:  
 
• Measurable Lesions  - M.lst  be accurately  measured  in at least one dimens ion (longest  
diameter  in the plane of measurement  is to be recorded)  with a minimum  size of: 
• [ADDRESS_914947] scan  (irrespect ive of scanner  type)  and MRI (no less than doubl e the slice 
thickness  and a minimum  of 10 mm) 
• 10 mm caliper measurement  by [CONTACT_461]  (when  superfic ial) 
 
• Malignant  lymph  nodes  are cons idered pathol ogically enlarged and measurabl e, a lymph  
node must  be <!: [ADDRESS_914948] scan  (CT scan  slice thickness  
recommended  to be no greater  than 5 mm).

Approval  date:  09-0ct-2018  
Page  51 of 86  
  
 
 
• Nonmeasurable Lesions  - Nonmeasurab le lesions  are defined as all other  lesions (or sites of 
disease),  including small  lesions (longest  diameter  < 10 mm or patho logical lymph  nodes  with 
<!: 10 to < 15 mm short  axis).  Lesions considered truly nonmeasurab le include the following: 
leptomeni ngeal  disease,  ascites, pleural/pericardi a! effus ion, inflammatory  breast  disease,  
lymphangit ic involvement  of skin or lung,  abdominal  masses/abdomi nal organomegaly  
identified by [CONTACT_676613].  
• Target  Lesions  • All lesions  up to a maximum of 5 lesions  total (and a maximum  of 2 lesions 
per organ)  representative of all involved organs  shou ld be identified as target  lesions. It may be 
the case  that, on occasion,  the largest  lesion does  not lend itself to reproduc ible measurement  
in which circumstance the next largest  lesion which can be measured  reproduc ibly shou ld be 
selected.  
 
• Non-target  Lesions  • It is poss ible to record  multip le non-target  lesions involving the same  
organ as a single item on the case  record form (e.g., "multiple enlarged peMc lymph  nodes·  or 
"multiple  liver metastases")  
Response Criteria  
Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
• Complete  Response • Disappearance of all target  lesions. Ally patholog ical lymph  nodes  
(whether  target  or non-target)  must  have reduction in short  axis to < 10 mm (the sum may not 
be "O" if there are target  nodes).  
• Partial  Response • At. least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the diameters  of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease • At. least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest  sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest  on study).  In addit ion to the relative increase of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  
an abso lute increase of at least  5 mm. (Note: the appearance  of one or more new lesions  is 
also considered progression.)  
• Stable  Disease ·Neither  suffic ient shrinkage  to qualify for PR nor suffici ent increase to qualify  
for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum of diameters  while on study.  
Evaluation  of Non-target  Lesions  
• Complete  Response • Disappearance of all non-target  lesions and norma lization of tumor  
marker  level.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-patholog ical in size (< 10 mm short  axis).  
• Non-complete  response/Non -progressive  disease • Persistence  of 1 or more non-target  
lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance of tumor  marker  level above the normal  limits. 
• Progressive Disease • Unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions  will be defined  
as the overall  level of substant ial worsen ing in non-target  disease such  that, even in presence  
of SD or PR in target  disease,  the overall  tumor burden has increased sufficiently  to merit 
discont inuation of therapy.  In the absence of measurab le disease,  change  in non-measurab le 
disease comparab le in magnitude  to the increase  that would be required to declare PD for

measurabl e disease.  Examp les include an increase  in a pleural  effusion from 'trace' to 'large,'  
an increase in lymphang itic disease from localized to widespread.  
Appearance of New Lesions  
 
The appearance of new lesions is considered PD according to RECI ST v 1.[ADDRESS_914949]  been observed with immunotherapy,  new lesions may not 
represent  true disease progression.  In the absence of rapid clinical deter ioration,  subjects  may 
continue to receive treatment  with durvalumab and tremelimumab.

treme limumab  (cohort  1) or ablation  plus durvalumab  and tremelimumab (cohort  2). Based on 
historical controls, 1/20 responses  may be observed in a non-radiated or non-ablated lesion with 
these  current  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676563]  a response rate S5% as unacceptable  (Overman,  Kopetz  et 
al. 2016).  A two-stage  Simon's  optimal  design  will be employed  to test the null hypothesis  that the 
true response rate is S5% versus  the alternati ve hypothesis  that the true response rate is at least  
25% with type Iand II error  rates of 10%  each.  Each cohort  will be evaluated  separately  for this 
purpose.  Patients  will be cons idered  evaluable if they have received at least one dose of 
durvalumab  and/or  tremelimumab  and undergone  ablation/RT.  Response  will be determined only in 
disease  that is not ablated or radiated.  In the first stage,  we will accrue  9 patients in each cohort.  If 0 
objective  tumor  responses  (PR or CR) are observed among the [ADDRESS_914953] igators  which cohort  to expand  
based on pharmacodynami c data (such  as circulating  CEA,  changes  in composition/acti vation status  
of lymphocyte subsets  present  in peripheral  blood mononuc lear cell preparations  or tumor  
immunoh istochem istry analysis, and/or  circulating cytokines/  chemokines).  The cohort to be 
expanded will enroll  an additional  [ADDRESS_914954] igation in that particular cohort.  If at the end of the 
study  <![ADDRESS_914955] 1.1 are observed  in the expanded cohort,  then further 
investigation of durval umab and tremel imumab  plus RT and/or  durva lumab and tremelimumab plus

other  reasons.  This study  requires  accrual  of a minimum of 18 subjects  and up to a maximum of 33 
subjects  if one cohort  is expanded  to the second  stage.  The accrual  time is estimated to be 9 
months  to 2 years  for both cohorts.  
Antitumor  Activity  
 
Assessmen1s  of antitumor  activity  will be based  on the ORR,  PFS,  and OS. Response Evaluation  
Criter ia in Solid Tumors  guidelines (v1.1)  (Eisenhauer,  Therasse et al. 2009).  
 
The ORR  is defined as the proporti on of subjec1s  CR or PR based on RECI ST criteria. The exact  
95% Cl of ORR  will be estimated using  the binomial  distribution.  Progressi on-free survival  will be 
measured from the start of treatment  with durvalumab  and tremelimumab  until the documentation of 
disease progression or death due to any cause,  whichever  occurs  first. Progression- free survival  will 
be censored  on the date of last tumor  assessment  documenting  absence  of tumor  progress ion for 
subjects  who are still alive  prior to data cutoff,  dropout,  or the initiation  of  alternate  anticancer  
treatment.  Subjects  having no tumor  assessmen1s  after the  start of treatment  with durvalumab  and 
tremelimumab will  have  PFS  censored  on  the  first  date  of  treatment  with  durval umab  and 
tremelimumab.   These  patients  will  be counted  as  non  responders  and  considered  evaluable.  
Progression -free survival  will  be evaluated  using  the Kaplan- lv'eier  method (Kaplan  and  Meier,  
1958).  Overall  survival  will be determi ned as the time from the start of treatment  with durva lumab  
and tremelimumab  until death.  For subjects  who are alive  at the end of study  or lost to follow -up, OS 
will be censored  on the last date when subjects  are known  to be alive. The OS will be evaluated  
using the Kaplan- lv'eier method.  Progression free survival  at 1 and 2 years  will be estimated  by [CONTACT_17680]-lv'eier.

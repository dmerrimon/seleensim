 Evaluation of Novel Point of The Care Coagulation System in Pregnant Women  
 
Unexpected obstetric hemorrhage continues to confront anesthesiologists , and obstetric hemorrhage 
spearheads  as the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity .  One of the hurdles confronting 
clinician s is the lack of a Point of the care coagulation system that can hasten the clinician management 
strategy in the right direction. Conventional time -tested coagulation systems take considerable time to 
obtain results.  Thromboelastography (TEG ®) and Rotatio nal Throboelastometry (ROTEM ®) are welcome 
additions to assess coagulation quickly.  However, these two modalities require expertise and proficient 
training to perform test, and interpret results. This poses a hurdle for providing coagulation evaluation 
services around the clock.  Therefore, many users of these technologies rely on the conventional 
laboratory personnel to use these te chnologies  at remote location and thereby [CONTACT_279398]. What is currently re quired for efficient and effective management 
of obstetric hemorrhage is a point of care coagulation system  in the operating room or labor and 
delivery suite that is user friendly, easy and quick to perform by [CONTACT_279399].  In this study, we evaluate a new point of the care , Quantra Hemostasis 
Analyzer system to assess coagulation rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279397]. The Quantra is a fully automated instrument 
that requires no sample handling steps from the user.  The aim of the present study is to determine how 
Quantra system performs when compared to conventional coagulation tests at varying level of 
fibrinogen and clotting factors in the blood obtained from pregnant women.   
Methods:  
Details of the system : 
The Quant ra is a Point of the Care instrument where all components of test sequence,  fluid handling, 
temperature control,  ultrasound transmission, data processing and result output are automated. The 
device incorporates an embedded processor, a mechanical assembly that provides connection to a 
peristaltic pump and solenoid valves, heating elements to heat and maintain samples at 37 °C, and 
ultrasound transducers operating in the megahertz range.  Figure [ADDRESS_341067] of any potential heparin in the blood sample. Clot Times provides 
an indication of the functional status of the coagulation factors that lead to fibrin formation.

 Furthermore, Clot Time and Heparinase Clot Time (channel 2)  can be combined to a clot time ratio for 
determining the presence of residual heparin in the sample.  Channel 3 is optimized to provide 
measurements of clot stiffness, which combines information about platelets and fibrinogen function. 
Finally, channel 4 is optimized to m easure the Fibrinogen contribution to clot stiffness.  Both channels 3 
and 4 use hexadimethrine bromide to neutralize residual heparin.  The difference between Channel 4 
and 1 can provide platelet contribution to clot stiffness.  
We designed an in vitro mode l of obstetric hemodilutional coagulopathy to assess the new technology. 
We also measured coagulation parameters after reconstituting the dilutional blood with undiluted blood  
to obtain serial increase in coagulation factors . The results obtained were comp ared to ROTEM ®.  The 
Quantra has been designed to provide results in [ADDRESS_341068] so far among available 
coagulation technologies.  
Quantra uses SEER Sonorheometry. This is a patented technology that uses high -frequency ultrasound 
pulses to quant ify the shear modulus (stiffness) of a blood sample during the process of coagulation. The 
shear modulus is a parameter that describes the elastic properties of a solid material. The shear 
modulus of bone tissue is approximately 3.[ADDRESS_341069], causing the 
sample to resonate once the clot begins to form. As the clot vibrates during resonance, a series of 
“tracking” ul trasound pulses are transmitted,  and the returning echoes  are analyzed to estimate the 
sample’s motion. The shape of estimated displacement curve is directly related to the shear modulus of 
the sample. The time -displacement curve can be compared to theoret ic models to determine the actual 
shear modulus for that specific point in time. Repeated acquisition over time produces a signature [CONTACT_279403].  From this curve, the 
start of the clot  formation, or clot time, and the stiffness of the clot can be directly estimated. The 
combination of these two parameters provides information about the functional role of the coagulation 
factors, fibrinogen, and platelets in the sample. Shear  modulus val ues are determined every 4 seconds 
by [CONTACT_279400]. Clot time, expressed in minutes, is estimated by [CONTACT_279401] a predefined value. Clot stiffness is estimated by 
[CONTACT_279402] r modulus value at a specific time point after clot time. This parameter is expressed 
in units of hectopascals, or hPa  (1 hPa= 100 Pa).  
Validation and comparative studies  
The validation of the results of Quantra have been performed using a plasma -based co ntrol material and 
Whole blood samples from healthy volunteers (blood samples obtained in 3.2% sodium citrate). 
Comparative studies were performed against TEG 5000 and the Clauss fibrinogen assay implemented in 
the StagoSTart4 Hemostasis  analyzer (Stago, Asnieres -sur-Seine, [LOCATION_009]).

Protocol : 
Twenty  healthy parturients aged 18 -40 years with uncomplicated pregnancies at term gestation, 3 7 to 
41 weeks, presenting for labor, or cesarean delivery will be recruited. Exclusion criteria includes 
hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preexisting coagul opathy, history of deep vein 
thrombosis, medications that impair coagulation, or his tory of pulmonary embolism or thrombosis.  
Women in active labor receiving intravenous fluids, or oxytocin will be also excluded. After obtaining 
consent, one table spoon of blood (1 6.2 ml) will be obtained at the time placement of intravenous 
cannula  alon g with blood obtained for routine blood work (Hemoglobin and platelet count).  The blood 
will be collected into five citrated Vacutainers (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) each with a 
maximum capacity of 2.7 mL of blood and containing 0.5 mL  0.109 mo lar, 3.2% sodium citrated. Citrated 
blood from each Vacu tainer from a single patient will be  pooled to eliminate variability in citrate 
concentration between samples.  
Protocol Methodology:  
Three ml (aliquot 1) of pooled blood will be used analyzed in the Quantra ana lyzer using 4 channel 
cartridge for obtaining clot time and clot stiffness.  Second aliquot (2) will be used to determine CBC and 
conventional coagulation tests ( PT, PTT, Fibrinogen, Factor VIII). These three sets (Quantra, CBC, and CL 
will pro vide baseline values for Quantra and conventional coagulation tests.  3 ml of pooled blood 
(aliquot 3) will be spun to yield plasma for additional process  (PP).  
Six ml (aliquot 4) will be mixed with 18 ml 0.9% normal saline to yield 24 ml of diluted blood  (75%). Four 
ml will be used for Quntra and CL tests. Four additional aliquots of diluted blood sample will be mixed 

[ADDRESS_341070]’s  plasma or non -pregnant plasma to yield 15%, and 30% PP aliquots, or 15% and 
30% NP aliquots. These diluted blood en riched samples will be analyzed for Quantra and CL tests.    
Details of the protocol flow are shown in table 2.  
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Results will be presented as Mean±SD for each parameter . Paired t test will be used to study differences 
in each parameter compared to the baseline for each method.   
A scatter plot will be used to compare variations in parameter among three methods of coagulation 
assessment.  
In addition, ANOVA (Analysis of V ariance) for multiple comparisons will be used to assess changes in 
coagulation parameter of each methodology.

 VAX- MOM COVID-19: Protocol for Phase 2  
 
Lead Principal Investigator ( URMC Site) – Cynthia Rand, MD, MPH 
Investigator (UCLA Site) – Peter Szilagyi, MD, MPH  
Investigator (RRH Site) – Elizabeth Westen, MD    
 
 
NOTE: The VAX- MOM COVID-19 study is divided into 2 main phases, baseline and 
intervention. The baseline phase  [STUDY00007624: VAX- MOM: COVID -19 (Phase 1) ] was 
previously submitted and approved independently through each participating health system ’s 
regulatory board.  
 
The current protocol covers the intervention phase  (Phase 2 ), which is being submitted for 
single IRB review, with the University of [COMPANY_002]ster RSRB acting as the IRB of record for all 
study sites. 
 
 
1. PURPOSE OF STUDY  
 
COVID-[ADDRESS_284034] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53763]-19 among infants was 52% overall, 80% during the delta period, and 38% during the omicron period.
3 Importantly, studies show that the vaccine is safe and 
not associated with any negative maternal or infant outcomes.4 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_234994]-19 vaccination, only 71% of pregnant women were 
vaccinated for COVID -19 as of June 2022 (most prior to pregnancy), with a much lower rate 
of 58% among non- Hispanic Black women.
5 Additionally, only 56% of pregnant women 
overall have received a booster, but only 39% of Black pregnant women have received a COVID-19 booster vaccine. An effective intervention is needed to improve COVID vaccination rates for pregnant women  overall, and particularly for Black women . 
 
Using participating OB/GYN offices affiliated with 3 health systems in NY and CA, the 
VAX- MOM COVID -19 intervention phase  will implement a quality improvement 
initiative  aimed at increasing maternal COVID -19 vaccination rates at participating 
sites.  
 
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
Burden of COVID-19 Pregnant women  are at risk of significant morbidity and mortality from COVID -19 
infection, compared to the general population. Complications include increased need for ICU care, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, prolonged ventilation, and death.

4. STUDY DESIGN & PROCEDURES  
 
Brief Overview  of Phase 2:   
Using a clustered RCT (randomizing practices), we will allocate half of the practices within each 
health system to the VAX -MOM  COVID -[ADDRESS_284039] of care 
(control) . We will measure the impact of the intervention on vaccination rates (primary 
outcomes) as well as rate s of vaccination by [CONTACT_6496] (secondary outcomes) (see Table 4) . 
Finally, if VAX -MOM COVID -19 is successful, we will provide the control practices with core 
intervention materials (e.g., learning module, rate feedback template) at the conclusion of the study.   
Design and Procedural  Details of Phase 2: (also see Figure 1 for Timeline)  
 Step 1 ) Deliver VAX- MOM  COVID-19 training  to randomized practices:  
 
Randomization Details :  
 Practices will be the unit of randomization. We will assign practices using a covariate constrained randomization strategy. Practices will be stratified by [CONTACT_96304], as well as arm assignment in the primary VAX -MOM trial. Within strata, we will perform 
constrained randomization to allocate practices to intervention/control arms, and ensure each arm has similar baseline COVID vaccination rat es, percent of patients covered by 
[CONTACT_5556], number of OB providers, and number of patients. Specifically, we will use these variables to construct and evaluate a balance criterion, which is the sum of the squared difference between standardized group means on these variables. We will generate all possible combinations of eligible practices in 2 arms (using a SAS macro), and define an acceptable set of randomizations that result in balanced variables (generally the lowest 10% on the balance criterion). From this set of randomizations, we will select one set at random, and then randomly assign each practice to intervention vs control group. 
STUDY00007717  Page 7 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 Intervention Details: 
 
Once randomization has been completed, and “intervention group” practices have been 
identified, m ultiple quality improvement (QI) techniques will be aimed at practice 
providers, nurses, and staff.  
 
• Identification of a “vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” at each intervention site:  At each site, 
the affiliated medical director or health system liaison will select one “vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” for each practice.  Each identified vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96267] e- mailed 
an Information Sheet (see “InfoSheet_VaccineChampi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]…”  document) by [CONTACT_33662], outlining the basic study goals as well as their involvement in tasks throughout the training and intervention adoption phases of the study (see “Consent Process” section). The position of vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96268], and if they do not wish to accept the role, they may decline and another individual will be identified  as a replacement . The  vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96269] a lead role 
throughout the study intervention, including: 
o assisting with the dissemination of e -learning training modules and the 
scheduling of follow- up site -specific meeting s 
o acting to ensure training content is being appropriately adopted into practice workflow procedures 
o fielding questions from site personnel regarding the logistics of study interventions  
o acting  as an ongoing liaison between the site personnel and study staff 
o leading regular discussion s regarding immunization rate feedback  with  site 
personnel (see step 2 for further detail)  
o planning for and completing monthly PDSA cycles  (see step 2 for further 
detail)  
o monthly completion of the “Practice Time/Cost Survey” (see step 4 for 
further detail)  
o participating in monthly learning collaborative meetings with the study team  
 
• Delivery /discussion  of an online training module : Each site will receive 
training focused on four main areas of content : a) the importance of COVID-19 
vaccination during pregnancy, b) vaccine communication, c) optimization of workflow and d ) review and resources  (see Table 3). This training will be 
delivered first via an online e-learning platform, and next via an in-person or virtual site meeting.

o E-learning module dissemination: Module lessons will first be 
disseminated  to practice site personnel via an e-mail link taking them to 
the Articulate/Rise 36 0 platform . The s tudy coordinator will obtain e- mail 
addresses for the site personnel from either the health system liaison or the 
associated vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and will then e- mail a training content link 
to all appropriate site providers, nurses, and staff. Attached to this initial e -
mail will be an Information Sheet describing the study goals and training phase details , as well as their involvement throughout the duration of the 
6-month QI intervention (see “IntroEmail_TrainingPhase …” and 
“InfoSheet_TrainingPhase… ” documents; also see  “Consent Process” 
section for more detail).  After reviewing the Information Sheet and 
discussing any questions/concerns with study staff, site personnel will be asked to access and complete the training lesson s prior to their  scheduled 
site meeting .  
 
Embedded at the conclusion of the online training module, will be a link to a brief REDCap survey (see “TrainingModuleCompletionSurvey…”  
document ) to obtain information regarding those who have fully 
STUDY00007717  Page 9 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.[ADDRESS_284040] will be acc essible only by [CONTACT_235023]/ CME/CNE credit  for their 
participation  and to calculate overall completion rates for each site.  
 
o Site m eeting : Following the online training, all site personnel will meet 
with study staff either in -person or via a virtual Zoom meeting . The 
meeting s (both virtual and in-person) will be audio and video recorded  
using a laptop or handheld recording device (in -person meetings) or via 
the Zoom recording option (virtual meetings)  (see “Audio/Video 
Recording” and “Privacy and Confidentiality” sections for more detail). These archived video files will allow for the review of meeting content by [CONTACT_96309], or by [CONTACT_235024] a second time.  
 During the site meeting, study staff will briefly review online training content, allow time for the sharing of  comments/questions from site 
personnel, and lead a discussion regarding the application of training content ideas specifically to that practice site.  During this meeting, study 
staff will also present site personnel with their current immunization rates.  
Each designated vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235002] “participant list.” T he study 
coordinator will store this roster in a  password -protected E xcel file. The 
names will not be linked with any other study data. This list will be accessed for the purposes of confirming those who should receive MOC credit  for their participation in the project, and for calculating overall 
attendance rates for each site.  
 
o MOC/CME/CNE c redit: To encourage the completion of online trainings 
and attendance at  site meetings, providers and nurses will be offered 
CME/CNE credit for completing the online learning module, and providers will be offered MOC/QI  credit for attending office systems 
change meetings and reviewing practice rates.  
 Step 2) Implement  intervention ideas and m onitor progress at intervention  practices:  
 
To monitor the adoption of VAX- MOM COVID -19 training content (changes in 
communication techniques, workflow optimization, etc.) at each practice site, e ach 
vaccine cham pi[INVESTIGATOR_235003] : 
 
1. Lead a discussion regarding immunization rate feedback with  practice providers, 
nurses, and staff on a monthly  basis . The s ite-specific vaccination information  
will be obtained from either : 1) the EHR report builders for each health system, 
or 2) manual chart review  (i.e., accessing eRecord to look up patient charts and 
STUDY00007717  Page 10 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 entering information into a REDCap data entry template) completed by [CONTACT_235025]’s vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] . Obtained vaccination information will be 
uploaded to the secure UCLA Health  Box folder. The project’s data analyst will 
plug this vaccination information into a template that will create visual graphs and tables, allowing practice personnel to better understand trends within their site. The study coordinator will then disseminate the visual vaccination rate  
feedback  to each site for review and discussion (see “RateFeedbackTemplate …” 
document).  
 
2. Develop PDSA cycle goals  on a monthly basis utilizing knowledge about current 
workflow efficiency and data from vaccine rate reports . Vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96273] ( see “PDSAandTimeCostSurvey… ” document) to 
guide progress with their respective teams. The template will help them decide upon specific intervention activities appropriate for their setting, track those involved with each activity, compare results from the activity to previous performance, and focus on changes that may need implementation during future 
cycles. PDSA cycle logs will be sent to vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235004] a 
secure REDCap survey. 
 
For participating NY practice sites, the 6 -month intervention (entailing PDSA 
cycles described above) will be extended  by 3- 5 months  (depending upon the 
original start date of the  specific location ) until April of 2024, to optimize 
vaccine intervention efforts and data collection during the peak of the COVID season.  
 
During the 6+-month intervention phase, a study team member may observe intervention sites in -person in order to collect qualitative data regarding 
workflow and communication techniques as described in the sites’ submitted PDSA cycle logs. Specifically, the study team member will document the ways in which the targeted  intervention techniques are implemented within the 
practice (see “In Person ObservationNotes …” document). Observation notes will 
then be compared with submitted PDSA cycle log information and analyzed for consistency.   Of N ote: Although study staff will observe OB/GYN practice personnel during 
patient encounters, practice patients will NOT be the target of the observation, and no identifying patient information will be collected. Rather, the focus of observation will be the select practice personnel  only. Any patient- level 
information recorded during the observation will be done so in a generic manner such that the patient could not be identified on the basis of the notes (e.g., “…when patient indicated that they did not want the  COVID -19 vaccine, the 
nurse stated, ‘The doctor may talk to  you more about that when she comes in.’” ).  
 
3. Complete the “Practice Time/Cost Survey”  on a monthly basis (see step 4 for 
further detail).  The vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235005] (e.g., Ob/Gyn, nurse, desk 
STUDY00007717  Page 11 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 staff, etc.) within the practice.  They will then complete a monthly REDCap 
survey r eport ing aggregate information regarding total time spent on project-
specific activity ( see“PDSAandTimeCostSurvey… ” document ).  
 
Additionally, t o monitor s tudy staff effort s during this phase (to parallel surveys 
completed by [CONTACT_235026][INVESTIGATOR_5458]) , study staff will participate in the completion 
of a weekly  “Study Staff Time Survey”  (see step 4 for further detail).  
 
Again, for participating NY practice sites, the 6 -month intervention (including 
the Practice Time/Cost Survey and Study Staff Time Survey described above) will be extended by 3-5 months depending upon the specific location, to optimize vaccine intervention efforts and data collection during the peak of the COVID season.  
 
4. Participate in learning collaborative meetings on a monthly basis with the study 
team. The vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235006], along with the study team, will meet together as a group to discuss current COVID -19 
information, intervention strategies/tips  and overall project progress. 
 
 
Step 3) Compare intervention vs. control practices:  
 
Using the “RE- AIM” framework (see Table 4) we will compare intervention practices to 
control practices  using multiple  data sources . We will focus  on one primary outcome and 
multiple secondary outcomes. 
 
Primary Outcome: Following the conclusion of phase 2 (6-month duration), w e will 
assess the “Effectiveness” of the intervention by [CONTACT_235027]-
[ADDRESS_284041]  control group COVID -19 vaccination rates . 
 
Secondary Outcomes: Following the conclusion of phase 2 (6-month duration), w e will 
assess the remaining “ RE-AIM ” domains including “Reach,” “Adoption,” 
“Implementation,” and “Maintenance.”

• Tdap vaccination status  (dates)  
STUDY00007717  Page 13 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
  
• EHR  Measure Procedures: EHR  data report builders for each health system will 
extract the requested information (data in Table 5, also see “EHRData… ” document)  
using live births occurring from July [ADDRESS_284042] 
into an excel file  which will then be uploaded to a secure UCLA Health Sciences  Box 
“initial report” folder  for the study team.  
 
The data will be extracted for intervention and control sites both a)  on a monthly 
basis , for the purposes of providing monthly rate feedback reports to intervention 
sites, and b)  if needed,  at the conclusion of the study to obtain any missing data from 
sites not obtained in the previous months. 
 
Initial automated report files will go through an auditing process in which a small 
percentage of patient charts will be reviewed manually (i.e., charts accessed in 
eRecord) by [CONTACT_235028]. Study staff completing this process will have received the proper Epic/EHR training and clearance. During the auditing process, files will be placed temporarily in  secure 
“SMDNAS Research Storage” folder s, to reduce the risk of altering original report 
files, or confusing audited files for originals.  
 
Once the auditing process is complete, the final ized EHR reports will be uploaded 
back into a secure UCLA Health Sciences  Box “final report” folder for analysis  
and/or for creation of the monthly rate feedback form by [CONTACT_235029]. De-identified analyzed data and/or the rate feedback reports will then be placed in a 
“analyzed data/rate feedback reports” folder on UCLA Health  Box by [CONTACT_235030] , accessible by [CONTACT_3476]. For monthly rate feedback reports, the study 
coordinator will then disseminate the vaccination rate  reports  for each site to all 
corresponding vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235007] e- mail. 
 
In the event automated reports cannot be generated in a time ly manner (i.e., as needed 
for monthly feedback or final analyse s), study staff or vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235008]. A list of delivery MRNs 
will be passed from the health system liaison into UCLA Health  Box, to identify 
appropriate patient charts that should be reviewed. Study staff will then manually acces s patient charts in eRecord for the appropriate health system  and enter the 
information indicated in Table 5 into a REDCap “Manual Chart Review Tool” (i.e., a form into which study staff can easily enter the information needed).  Once manual data entry into REDCap has been completed, the information will be exported as an 
excel file and saved to the secure UCLA Health Sciences  Box “final report” folder (as 
auditing will not be needed).  Additional Information: Patient Demographics • DOB

• Survey Measure Description : The Post-Intervention Survey (see 
“VAXMOMCOVID_ PostInterventionSurvey…”  document) is a  survey consisting of 
Likert scale, multi-option and open-ended questions. The survey takes approximately 10 
minutes to complete. The survey assesses opi[INVESTIGATOR_235009] -19 infection and 
vaccination, patient vaccine refusal, barriers to vaccination, vaccine workflow , RSV 
vaccine, practice culture, and basic demographic information. 
 
• Survey Measure Procedures : At the conclusion of phase 2 , all providers (MD, 
residents, NPs, PAs and CNMs) and 1-[ADDRESS_284044] nurses  from both the intervention and 
control sites will be asked to complete the survey. A notification e -mail (see 
“NotificationEmail…” document) may first be sent out by [CONTACT_235031]/or Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology affiliated with the appropriate health system. 
 
Surveys will be e-mailed to providers and select nurses by [CONTACT_235032] (see “IntroEmail_PostIntervention Survey …” document). E-
mail addresses will have previously been obtained from the health system liaison or vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235010]. After initial survey 
distribution, if the subject does not click on the survey link embedded within the e- mail, 
the REDCap platform will automatically disseminate reminder e -mails to the subject 
(identical content as initial invite e -mail). Once clicked, the survey link will first take 
potential respondents to the Survey Information Sheet for review  (see “Consent Process” 
section for more details) , and if they agree, will then allow them to continue to the full 
survey. Surveys will be sent in 3 “waves” in order to allow subjects from each health 
system to view their own system-specific Information Sheet (e.g., URMC  subjects will 
first see the URMC  Info Sheet, followed by [CONTACT_235033]). Subjects  may answer survey 
questions at their own pace and may stop and restart at any time. At the conclusion of the survey, they will receive an automated confirmation message to assure them that the process is complete.  
 
Step 4 ) Evaluate cost of the VAX-M OM COVID-19 intervention:  
 
Practice Time & Cost Survey ( see“PDSAandTimeCostSurvey…”  document) : A survey 
aimed at evaluating the amount of time and money devoted to VAX- MOM  COVID-[ADDRESS_284045] time/cost estimates pertaining to the month prior.  
 
Study Staff Time  Survey ( see “StudyStaffTime Survey…”  document): A survey aimed at 
evaluating the efforts of VAX -MOM  COVID -19 study staff will be sent to study 
personnel on a weekly  basis via REDCap . 
 
Final Time & Cost Analysis :  
Upon completion of phase [ADDRESS_284046] a final time/cost analysis. Our two -fold cost 
measures are (a) total intervention cost to implement the VAX -MOM  COVID -[ADDRESS_284047] analysis and (b) cost per 
additional vaccination under a subsequent cost- effectiveness analysis.

An estimated 57% of practicing Obstetrician/Gynecologists (OB) and 85% of graduating OB residents are female.  Therefore, we anticipate a higher percentage of females among the provider study subjects. Patient study subjects will all be female.

 6. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA & RECRUITMENT METHODS  
 
All Participating Sites  (Intervention & Control) 
URMC, RRH and UCLA  sites that participated in the previous VAX -MOM studies 
(STUDY00007624, STUDY00005115 and STUDY00004408) were invited to participate 
in this study. Prior to the start of the current VAX- MOM COVID-[ADDRESS_284054] in continued participation. 
 
Originally (for previous VAX- MOM studies) , health s ystems ( URMC/RRH/UCLA ) 
within each state were chosen because a) their size allowed for an ample sampling of patients and practitioners (i.e., large subject pool) and b) they allowed for a broad spectrum of geographic and socio -economic diversity (e.g., privately and publicly 
insured, ethnic multiplicity , rural and urban locations, etc.).  
    
Intervention Sites  
As described in the “Randomization” subsection of the “Study Design & Procedures” portion of the protocol, study sites from the larger pool w ill be  selected to be part of the 
“intervention group” using specific constrained randomization procedures within each health system (see section 4 of protocol for more details). All remaining sites will be  
allocated to the “control group.” 
 
Practice- Level Personnel  
 
Criteria /Recruitment Method  for Vaccine Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]:  
At each site, the affiliated medical director or health system liaison will select one “vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” for the practice. The vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96283] a lead role throughout the study intervention, including the ir 
ability to complete all monthly tasks listed in “Step 1” of the “Study Design and Procedures” section . The position of vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96268], and if they do not 
wish to accept the role, they may decline and another individual will be identified as a replacement . 
 Criteria /Recruitment Method  for Remaining Site Personnel : 
By [CONTACT_15094] (and with the support of health system and practice site leaders) all remaining providers, nurses, and practice staff employed by [CONTACT_96322], are able to participate in the quality improvement initiative.  
   
STUDY00007717  Page 19 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 Patient -Level Study Subjects  
 
Criteria for EHR  Data from Practice Patients (Pregnant Women):  
Baseline vaccine rates  (reported to each site during their site meeting) were established 
during the prior protocols (STUDY00007624, STUDY00005115 and STUDY00004408), 
and contained EHR information from practice patients who were identified as having a live birth within a 6 month time period prior to the start of the intervention.  
 
To establish vaccine rates for the ongoing monthly feedback reports (July [ADDRESS_284055]), 
EHR information will be collected every month from intervention sites  during the 
entirety of the intervention phase (see timeline depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1). EHR information will reflect practice patients who are identified as having a live birth on record for that 
month. Again, a ll subjects will be female and may be <18 years of age.   
 
To establish the final vaccine data report s (for intervention vs. control comparison), 
detailed EHR information  (see Table 5)  will be collected from both intervention and 
control sites for the entire intervention  period, and additionally, any missing data from 
the baseline period will be collected at this time . 
 
7. CONSENT PROCESS  
 
Health System, Practice Site, & Site Personnel Level   
 
Health System & Practice Site  Consent:  
 
Health system support, and subsequently site-level support, was previously obtained during phase 1 of this  study ( STUDY00007624) , as well as during our 
original VAX- MOM stud ies (STUDY00005115 and STUDY00004408) , and i s 
described in the “Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria & Recruitment Methods” section of the protocol.  
 Site Personnel  Consent:   
 
Delivery of Training Content & Involvement in 6- Month QI Intervention   
(All site personnel: c ompletion of e -learning module, attendance of follow -up site 
meeting , and participation in monthly discussions of rate feedback and PDSA 
cycles )  
 
This study involves commonly accepted quality improvement efforts aimed to improve upon the standard of care in medical settings, such as the completion of e-learning modules and in-person trainings specifically related to practice goals, the review of practice metrics  (vaccine rates)  by [CONTACT_8786], discussion of 
office workflow  procedures/efficacy , and trainings in optimal communication 
techniques.  
 
We are therefore seeking a waiver of documentation of consent for the training 
portion of the study. More specifically, we are requesting this waiver because: a)  
the training portion of the study is no greater than minimal risk, b)  the purpose of 
STUDY00007717  Page 20 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 the study/intervention and a basic framework of the trainings will be clearly 
outlined for participants in the Information Sheet (see “InfoSheet_TrainingPhase…”  document ) e-mailed to them at the onset of the 
intervention phase, and c) ample time will be given to personnel to review the 
Information Sheet in full and ask questions of study staff regarding the quality improvement effort and/or specific tasks involved in the training phase.  
 We will attach an Information Sheet (cited above) to the first e -learning invite e-
mail, describing the study goals and training phase details, as well as site personnel involvement throughout the duration of the 6-month QI intervention (e -
mailed to site personnel just prior to the training phase). Study staff will field any and all questions from potential study subjects prior to their module training and subsequent site meeting. 
 
Assessment of Intervention Adoption: Surveys & Rate Feedback   
(Selected Vaccine Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] : completion of monthly rate feedback discussions 
and monthly PDSA cycles and Practice Time & Cost Surveys; participation in monthly learning collaborative meetings) 
 
The assessment of intervention adoption by [CONTACT_235034] a medical setting , including the ongoing review of 
practice metrics (vaccine rate feedback sessions), the development and assessment of practice goals (PDSA Cycles  and learning collaborative meetings), and the 
evaluation of personnel efforts to achieve these goals (Time & Cost Survey). 
 
We are therefore seeking a waiver of documentation of consent for the intervention adoption portion of the study. More specifically, we are requesting this waiver because: a)  the assessment  portion of the study is no greater than 
minimal risk, b)  the purpose of the study/intervention and a description of the 
assessment tasks will be clearly outlined for vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235012] (see “Inf oSheet _VaccineChampi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]…” document ) e-mailed to 
them at the onset of the assessment phase, and c) ample time will be given to each 
vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235013]/or specific tasks involved in the assessment  phase.  
 
As soon as they are selected, each identified vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96267] e- mailed  
(see “IntroEmail_VaccineChampi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]…”  document) an Information Sheet by [CONTACT_33662], outlining the basic study goals as well as their involvement in tasks throughout the training and intervention adoption portions of the study. After the Information Sheets have been disseminated, the study coordinator will conduct a follow-up phone/Zoom call with  each vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], reviewing 
their role within the project and field ing any and all questions they may have. The 
position of vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96268], and if they do not wish to accept the role, they may decline and another individual will be identified as a replacement . 
  
STUDY00007717  Page 21 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 Assessment of Intervention Adoption: In-P erson Observation  
(Select Personnel : observation of workflow and communication techniques) 
 
The in -person observation of intervention adoption involves commonly occurring 
procedures within a medical setting, including the ongoing documentation and review of daily  workflow and communication procedures.  
 We are therefore seeking a waiver of documentation of consent for the in -person 
observation portion of the study. More specifically, we are requesting this waiver because: a)  the observation portion of the study is no greater than minimal risk, b)  
the purpose of the observation will be clearly outlined for practice personnel  in 
the Information Sheet ( see “InfoSheet_InPersonObs…”  document ) e-mailed to 
them prior to the scheduled observation, and c) ample time will be given to  
practice personnel to review the Information Sheet in full and ask questions of study staff regarding the observation.  
 
Prior to in -person observation, the study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_25733]’s 
vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235014]. Once the observation schedule has been determined, all personnel who are scheduled to work on the specified day(s) will be e- mailed an Information Sheet 
(see “ IntroEmail_InPersonObs…”  document) by [CONTACT_9137], which 
they may review at their own pace prior to the observation date. They may e- mail 
the project coordinator with any questions, or bring questions to the attention of the study staff on the scheduled visit day prior to the start of any observation. The content of the Information Sheet will be reviewed again  by [CONTACT_235035] (any personnel  not previously known to be working that day will be 
given a hard copy of the Information Sheet upon arrival by [CONTACT_96327] ). 
 
As stated previously, although study staff will observe OB/GYN practice personnel during patient encounters, practice patients will NOT be the target of the observation, and no patient information (in either individual or aggregate form) will be collected. Rather, the focus of observation will be the select practice personnel only. Information recorded during the observation session will be written in a generic manner such that specific personnel /patients will not be 
identifiable. Notes will describe the ge neral workflow processes and 
communication methods used, rather than specific unique behaviors or exact dialogue. For example, study staff may document “…when patient declined to 
receive the COVID  vaccine, the practice nurse gave them an informational 
handout and told them the doctor may speak with them further .” Although the 
patient is not the study subject, prior to each observation, practice personnel or the 
study staff will explain to the patient in simple language the purpose of the observation (i.e., to take notes regarding the nurse/staff work routine), and any patient that communicates discomfort or preference to not be observed, will not be observed.           
STUDY00007717  Page 22 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.[ADDRESS_284056]-Intervention Survey portion of the study. We are doing so because: a)  the survey is  no greater 
than minimal risk (a brief online survey with unobtrusive questions ), b) a detailed 
Information S heet will be made available to  each subject prior to the start of the 
survey (embedded within REDCap with subjects matched to the correct health-system Information Sheet) , c) ample time will be given to each subject to consider 
participation (subjects are notified of the survey via e- mail and can review the 
information sheet and/or ask questions of study staff for as long as necessary before deciding  about survey completion), and d)  no identifiers will be included 
on the survey form (only subject IDs), and the separate document linking subject name [CONTACT_96343] a limited number of study staff, will be kept under double-locked conditions, and will be de stroyed three years 
after study completion. 
 
Patient  (EHR) Level   
 EHR Data Extraction:  We are seeking a waiver of consent and a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization for the EHR data extraction portion of the study. We are doing so because: a) we believe that this research cannot be practicably conducted  without such a waiver , as 
we cannot feasibly obtain consent and HIPAA authorization from all potential subjects (thousands in total subject pool), b)  site liaisons  and report builders have routine access 
to patient records, c) a minimal number of patient- level data fields will be extracted from 
the EHR  (just enough to complete analysis) d)  a plan to protect EHR data du ring all data 
transfers will be implemented (see “Privacy & Confidentiality” section for details), e)  any 
individual-level data will be destroyed three years after study completion, and f)  PHI will 
not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity except (i) as required by [CONTACT_2371], (ii) for authorized oversight of the research study, or (iii) for other research for which the use or disclosure of PHI would be permitted by [CONTACT_36869].  
 
8. AUDIO/VIDEO RECORDINGS  
 
All site meetings held during the training phase and all learning collaborative meetings held during the intervention adoption phase may  be audio and/or video recorded using a laptop or 
handheld recording device (in-person meetings) or via the Zoom recording option (virtual meetings) (see “Privacy and Confidentiality” section for more detail). These archived audio/video files will allow for the review of meeting content by [CONTACT_235036], or by [CONTACT_235037] g 
discussion for a second time.  
 The archived meeting audio/video files will be stored on a secure Box platform, accessible only to study staff and site personnel from the corresponding practice site (each site will have their own Box folder ensuring meetings from other sites are not viewable to outside personnel). Invites to the secure Box folder will be e-mailed from study coordinators directly to site personnel. As soon as the video files have been uploaded to the secure Box platform, 
STUDY00007717  Page 23 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 they will be deleted from the laptop or handheld recording device. Once the study has been 
fully completed, all video files will be deleted from the shared Box folder. 
 
9.   RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
 Practice Level Risk: This project involves  QI trainings/interventions which aim to improve 
upon the existing communication  techniques and workflow procedures at each intervention 
practice site.  Planned study trainings/interventions are widely accepted among medical 
practices (e.g., practice providers/nurses/staff attending an informational meeting regarding the risk of COVID -19 in the pregnant population), and do not involve any novel high- risk 
changes to practice structure or procedures. Practice sites in the control group will continue to utilize “ best-practice” guidelines. Thus, at the practice level, anticipated overall study risk 
is very low.   Site Personnel &  Patient Level Risk: The primary  risk to site personnel and practice 
patients is the risk of a breach of confidentiality, though overall risk remains low.   To reduce risk, personal information being collected from site personnel or practice patients (EHR data) has been minimized, and when possible is being collected in aggregate form or using study IDs.   A number of policies, procedures, and technical safeguards (described in the “Privacy & Confidentiality” section of this protocol) will be in place to ensure that there is no breach of confidentiality as a result  of this study.   
 
10.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
 
Practice personnel will receive targeted training related to : COVID-[ADDRESS_284057] the 
opportunity to apply for MOC, CME, or CNE credit.  There are no anticipated benefits for practice patients  beyond those inherent to the 
overarching study goals (i.e., an improvement in immunization rates). 
 11.  COSTS FOR PARTICIPATION 
 
There will be no costs incurred by [CONTACT_4317].  
 12.  PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION  
 
For assisting with learning module dissemination/completion and site meeting scheduling/engagement, each vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96288] $ 50.  For completing the monthly 
“PDSA Cycle” and “Practice Time & Cost” survey s for the full 6 month duration, each vaccine 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_96288] $ 150. Payment s will be in the form of a n eG ift card and will be e- mailed 
to the vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235015] ($ 50) and conclusion of the 6 
month intervention phase ($ 150). For NY sites participating in the extended intervention period, 
STUDY00007717  Page 24 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235016] $25 for each continued month. 
 Additionally, i f manual chart review  is necessary to obtain vaccine rates for any practice sites, 
each vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96288] $[ADDRESS_284058] and will be e- mailed to the vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_96289] 6  month 
intervention phase.   For completing the “Post-Intervention Survey” portion of the study, each subject will receive $50. P ayment will be in the form of a n eG ift card and will be e- mailed  to the subject within [ADDRESS_284059] /site 
withd rawals , any site wishing to end their involvement in the quality improvement initiative may 
do so at any time. Any practice personnel wishing to abstain from participation in quality improvement activities (trainings, ongoing meetings, adoption of new workflow procedures) are free to do so. Any vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235017] 6 month intervention period, will still receive payment for all completed surveys prior to their withdrawal using a prorated amount. All subjects (practice personnel) are free to discontinue participation at any time, without consequence.  
 14.  PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBJECTS AND RESEARCH DATA  The following data collection and storage procedures will be implemented  to ensure that subject 
privacy and confidentiality are maintained throughout the entirety of the research process:  
 
Data obtained via e-mail and REDCap during the training phase : 
(Site personnel names collected during the e-learning modules and site meetings)  
 The s tudy coordinator will maintain  a list of site personnel  affiliated with all project 
locations, and those who have successfully completed their e-learning modules and who 
attended follow-up site meeting s.  These names will be obtained via e- mails from the vaccine 
champi[INVESTIGATOR_19035]/or REDCap surveys. The lists will be stored in a password protected Excel  
file on a password protected computer for the purposes of confirming request s for MOC, 
CME and CNE credit  and to track the overall level of active site participation . No additional 
study information (e.g., future survey responses) will be contained within this file.  All files will be stored on a secure server hosted by [CONTACT_77842] . These individual- level training 
completion files will be deleted once they are no longer necessary (i.e., once al l credit 
applications are in  and the project has concluded). Only aggregate data, not individual names, 
will be stored long-term by [CONTACT_96329] (i.e., the total number of providers, nurses, and staff who did/didn’t complete the training).  
  
STUDY00007717  Page 25 of 30           Version Date: 2.4.25  
 Data Obtained via REDCap  during the intervention adoption & assessment phase : 
(PDSA cycles, Time & Cost Surveys, Post -Intervention Survey) 
 
For study measures completed via a REDCap survey, a ll subject names and corresponding e-
mail addresses will first be collected by [CONTACT_235038] r the health system  
liaisons or the assigned vaccine champi[INVESTIGATOR_235018]. The names, e- mail addresses , site 
locations, role and an assigned subject ID for each person, will be stored in a password protected Excel file on a password protected computer. No additional study information (e.g., survey responses) will be contained within this file. All  files will be store d on a secure server 
hosted by [CONTACT_77842].   
Once e -mail addresses have been obtained, the study coordinator will upload the e- mail 
addresses onto the secure REDCap platform. S urveys will automatically be disseminated to 
the appropriate subjects through REDCap programming completed by [CONTACT_9137]. Completed REDCap survey data will be exported in an E xcel file and stored under double-
locked conditions (password protected file) on the secure “SMDNAS Research Storage” 
folders , before transfer to the UCLA Health Sciences  Box platform for analysis by [CONTACT_235039]’s UCLA data specialists .  
 
Data Obtained via EHR s: 
 
EHR data reports will be generated only by [CONTACT_235040] , or via manual chart review as described on page 12. A minimal number of patient-
level data fields (only those needed for analys es) will be extracted from the EHR s. For data 
verification purposes, identified study staff will check a small percentage of patient eRecord files to ensure the accuracy of generated EHR reports. The identified individuals will have access to EHR files and will complete all appropriate eRecord training prior to conducting 
data verification. All individual level PHI data will be stored  on either the secure UCLA 
Health Sciences  Box platform (original and final files) or the secure “ SMDNAS Research 
Storage” folders (files currently being audited). Whenever possible, data will be stored in aggregate form.  
 All Research Data :  
 
ORPA will be consulted and a Data Use Agreement (DUA) will be implemented as required  
between all participating health systems . 
 Please also see the “Human Subject Research Data Security Questionnaire” for all utilized methods of data collection/transfer/management/analyses  for all study activities .

 17. DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
The primary outcome (receipt of 1+ COVID vaccine) is binary and our main explanatory variable will be an indicator for study arm. We will employ intent- to-treat analyses using 
generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with practice random effects, an approach recommended for group- randomized RCTs in which the goal is to estimate the causal effects of 
interventions on individuals, adjusted for clustering within groups. This method performs well in situations where the number of observations per cluster is large and for unequal cluster sizes. Models will assume a binomial distribution and a log link function in order to compare vaccination rates between study arms in terms of risk ratios. We will adjust for all practice -level 
variables included in the randomization balancing criterion, as well as patient- level 
race/ethnicity. Hypothesis tests will be two -sided with alpha = 0.05. Analyses will be performed

 using SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 
 Power Analysis : We conservatively assume a control group vaccination rate of 50% (maximum 
variance). Adjusting for clustering of patients in practices, and assuming an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 1% (consistent with previous work), this sample size provides 80% power to detect an overall increase of 8.[ADDRESS_284062] (a simplification of the planned mixed model analysis described above), an alpha of 0.05, and a sample size of 5,000 pregnant wom en 
organized into 16 practices per study arm.  
Final Time/Cost Analysis :  
Our two -fold cost measures are (a) total intervention cost to implement the VAX -MOM 
COVID program aggregated at the three health -system level under a cost analysis and (b) cost 
per additional COVID vaccination under a subsequent cost- effectiveness analysis . To derive a 
policy implication regarding the sustainability of programs, we will estimate costs and ICER estimates from the health system perspective.  
 Costs : To make these cost measures comparable to similar past interventions of reminders 
and educational programs, we will estimate cost with one-year time horizon, excluding the cost to purchase, store and administer vaccines. We will estimate the total interv ention cost, summing 
non-personnel costs (e.g., EHR hardware, software, and materials) and personnel costs. The personnel costs will distinguish research costs from intervention costs (e.g., practice- level 
meeting and collecting EHR data). The dollar values of these person nel costs will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_96338] “time efforts” (weekly reported by [CONTACT_96339] a REDCap email survey) with the nationally representative “hourly-wage rates” by [CONTACT_235041], derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We are using this method in an NIH-funded R01 study (the STOP-HPV study) which involves a practice- level intervention to raise 
HPV vaccination rates and in the original VAX-MOM study; surveys take <[ADDRESS_284063] -Effectiveness : We will develop a standard decision model for our cost- effectiveness 
analyses as conducted in our past studies. The effectiveness measures are the rates of COVID vaccination estimated under Aim 2b. We will estimate incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the intervention defined as: ICER (Study vs control) = (cost
Study – cost Control ) / 
(COVID vaccine rate Study – COVID vaccine rate Control ) 
 In the numerator of the equation, the cost
Study is standardized to be equal to average 
intervention cost per patient in a study arm to account for the potential sample size difference between study and control arms. 
 As explained above, this intervention cost will exclude the cost to purchase, store and 
administer vaccines, which is assumed to be identical among all practices. Applying the same assumption, the average cost for the control group (cost
Control ) is zero. Using the developed 
standard decision model, we will conduct probabilistic analyses to generate point estimates and 95% CIs for ICERs and one -way sensitivity analyses to determine conditions for being lower 
than the thresholds of cost- effectiven ess, e.g., h ealthcare -system based quality improvement

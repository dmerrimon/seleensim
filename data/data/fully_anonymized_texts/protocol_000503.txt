Viral reactivation and infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after stem cell 
transplant. In this study we will attempt to decrease the incidence of viral infection or 
reactivation following stem cell transplantation. Peripheral blood from the transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s donor will be used to generate viral specific T-lymphocytes (VSTs) with 
specificity for EBV, CMV, BKV, and adenovirus. The VST’s will be frozen, and then 
infused no earlier than [ADDRESS_1160103]-transplant. The 
secondary endpoint is efficacy, as measured by [CONTACT_835535]/or 
reactivation and by [CONTACT_835536] T-cells in the blood.
2. PURPOSE
2.1 Objective of Study
The objective of this study is to establish the safety of infusing VSTs 21 days following 
stem cell transplant. A secondary objective is to assess efficacy of the viral cells in 
preventing viral reactivation or infection.
2.2 Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint of the study is the ability to give VSTs to 
stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [ADDRESS_1160104] Disease (aGVHD).
2.3 Secondary Endpoint: The secondary endpoint of the study is clinical efficacy of the 
infused  viral specific T-cells in preventing the development of viral infections. Efficacy will 
be assessed  by [CONTACT_835537][INVESTIGATOR_835512] a matched historical group of SCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

3. PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS AREA
Viral infections are a common problem after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), 
and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, treatment of viral infections is 
expensive and time consuming, with families often administering prolonged treatments 
with intravenous anti-viral medications, or children requiring prolonged admissions to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
Review of the experience at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835513] a high 
burden of viral infections.
CCHMC IRB# 2019-0229
Version 07.12.20193One hundred and twenty four allogeneic transplant patients, median age 4.9 years 
(range: 0.2-25.4) were identified and charts retrospectively reviewed. Ninety-five 
patients underwent HSCT for non-malignant disease, 29 for malignant disease. Graft 
source was unrelated donor in 102 (82%) and matched related in 22 (18%). Stem cell 
source was bone marrow in 94 (76%), peripheral blood stem cells in 16 (13%) and cord 
blood in 14 (11%). Sixty-four patients (35 with non-malignant disease, 29 with malignant 
disease) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. Forty-six patients (all with non-
malignant disease) received a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen, 14 Fanconi 
anemia patients received a RIC regimen with T-cell depletion of the graft. All patients 
were monitored for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and adenovirus 
(ADV) weekly in blood by [CONTACT_835538] +100. Human Herpes Virus-6 (HHV-6) 
and BK virus (BKV) were monitored when clinically indicated. Viral infection was defined 
as quantitative PCR detection in blood or qualitative detection in stool, urine, body fluids 
or relevant tissue (Ozdemir 2012).

*Viremia was defined as the presence of virus in blood. Disseminated infection was defined as virus 
detection in at least two different organ systems. N: patients with a specified condition, (%) percentage of 
patients affected. Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Busulfan/Cyclophosphamide/Anti-thymocyte 
Globulin (ATG) or Cyclophosphamide/TBI. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: 
Alemtuzumab/Fludarabine/Melphalan
Adenovirus and BK virus were the most prevalent infections, detected in half of the 
transplant patients, with adenovirus most likely to be disseminated. The use of 
Alemtuzumab, ATG and T-cell depletion is associated with increased risk of viral 
infection. We observed a higher prevalence of Adenovirus infections compared to other 
reports, likely due to high percentage of unrelated donors and use of Alemtuzumab and 
CCHMC IRB# 2019-0229
Version 07.12.20194ATG in these patients. These data reinforce the importance of adenovirus as a potential 
pathogen causing a high rate of disseminated infection in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Currently, there are no effective drugs for treatment of disseminated adenovirus 
infection (Ozdemir 2012).
A more recent analysis was done with one hundred and eighty seven allogeneic 
transplants performed at this institution between 2015-2018. Excluded from this analysis 
were the approximately 10% of patients who are at low risk for viral infections due to 
having fully matched related donors and a conditioning regimen that did not use T cell 
depletion (either alemtuzumab or ATG). Of these [ADDRESS_1160107] and Heslop at [LOCATION_007] Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (TCH) have demonstrated that T-lymphocyte (VST) lines with specificity for 
commonly detected viruses can be safely administered to pediatric transplantation 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835514]-versus-host 
disease.  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], the TCH group have shown that trivirus-specific VST lines 
targeting CMV, EBV, and adenovirus can be produced by [CONTACT_835539] B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCL) using a 
chimeric adenoviral vector expressing the immunodominant CMV-PP65 antigen.   
Further developments in the production of tri-valent VSTs have dramatically reduced 
production time resulting in the generation of VSTs for clinical use. The team at TCH 
have shown that clinically effective VSTs can be generated in 2-3 weeks by [CONTACT_835540], resulting 
in generation of viral specific VSTs in a shorter time frame compared to previously used 
methods.  Using this technology, the group showed an overall response rate of 80% 
against viral infections including adenovirus, EBV and CMV with no immediate or 
delayed toxicity (Gerdemann et al, 2013).
A phase I/II trial investigating the safety and efficacy of VSTs derived from patients’ 
stem cell donor has been open at CCHMC since 2014. Since then, more than [ADDRESS_1160108] analyzed the kinetics of viral 
CCHMC IRB# 2019-[ADDRESS_1160109] and 28th day following transplant. As a 
result, 10/[ADDRESS_1160110] been eligible to receive prophylactic VSTs at day +21, 
whereas only 5/[ADDRESS_1160111] been eligible at day +28. 
Currently, there is no published literature on the use of VST infusions to prevent or 
decrease the incidence and/or severity of viral infection or reactivation following stem 
cell transplant. However, a recent abstract was presented showing in a phase I clinical 
trial, the infusion of VSTs early after transplant (range of day +2-day +52) was feasible 
and safe, with no dose limiting toxicities and the only cases of GVHD occurring in 
patients with elevated GVHD biomarkers prior to the infusion of cells (Muranski et al 
2018). If successful, this approach would be expected to decrease morbidity along with 
health care cost to the patient with less need for antiviral medications (and their 
associated toxicities) and potentially shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959].
4. MANUFACTURE OF THE VSTs
The investigational cell product is an EBV, Adenovirus, CMV, and BKV-specific 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte preparation (quadravalent VSTs) derived from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
stem cell transplant donor. At the time of infusion, the product is comprised of:
Donor-derived Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (VST)
Human Serum Albumin
Plasmalyte
CryoStor 5 (Contains DMSO)
Dextran
The concentration and total cell number of VST in the product will vary based on the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835515]. 
All processing operations are performed by [CONTACT_835541]. This department routinely performs a variety of cell processing services such as 
cryopreservation and targeted cell selections to support clinical trial and standard of 
care activities for the stem cell transplant programs at UC Health, Cincinnati Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] (CCHMC), Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Inc., in Kenwood, OH, and Akron

Version 07.12.20196Donor selection and consent activities are performed by [CONTACT_835542] a separate CCHMC IRB protocol (CCHMC IRB# 2013-2777).  All 
donors will be screened and tested for a panel of infectious diseases within 7 days of 
collection (HIV I & II ag, HTLV I & II, RPR, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and CMV) using an 
FDA-approved testing method. Up to eighty mls of peripheral blood will be collected 
from donors and transported directly to Hoxworth Blood Center for production of the 
investigational product.  Briefly, the mononuclear cells are isolated and exposed to a 
mixture of antigenic viral peptides (pepmixes) that stimulate reactive T lymphocytes to 
proliferate in culture over a [ADDRESS_1160113] will be thawed in the cleanroom at Hoxworth

Viral infections from Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Adenovirus 
(ADV), and BK-virus (BKV) are seen in up to 50% of the HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835517].  
The intense immunosuppressive regimens necessary during the transplant process 
cause delayed and often defective immune reconstitution resulting in an increased risk 
of infection. A retrospective review of [ADDRESS_1160115] at CCHMC from January 2009 to December 2010 demonstrated ADV infection in 
53% of the patients, EBV infection in 38% and CMV infection in 20% of the 
patients(Ozdemir, 2012). Conventional anti-viral therapeutic agents are primarily active 
only against CMV, are associated with significant toxicity, and resistance is frequent; 
therefore these infections are often fatal for these children. Overall survival was only 
70% in this cohort, with viral infection as the cause of death in 10% of the patients. This 
rate of morbidity and mortality from viral infections is similar to prior published reports at 
other institutions (O’Reilly, 2007; Curtis, 1999; Zaia, 2002; ),thus it is clear that viral 
infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835518] (HSCT) from unrelated or mismatched donors.  
The majority of the supporting evidence for the use of multi-virus specific T cell 
immunotherapy also comes from the group at Baylor College of Medicine. They have 
conducted several small clinical trials in the past 10+ years with either monovalent (anti- 
EBV), bi-valent (anti-EBV & Adv, or trivalent (anti EBV, Adv, and CMV) VSTs produced 
as described in this IND. Leen et al first showed in 2006 that infusing monoculture-
derived CMV, EBV, and Adenovirus– specific (trivalent) VSTs is a safe and efficient way 
to restore viral-specific immunity in immunocompromised patients (Leen, 2006). They 
reported that all individuals with evidence of CMV, EBV, or Adv infection had a 
decrease in their viral titer and resolution of their disease symptoms that coincided with 
the expansion of virus-specific VSTs in vivo.  This same group also showed that 
infusions of bivalent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (VST) lines with specificity for EBV and 
adenovirus can be safely administered to pediatric transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835519]–matched and haploidentical stem cell grafts (n = 13) 
without inducing graft-versus-host disease (Leen, 2009). None of these [ADDRESS_1160116] epi[INVESTIGATOR_76802], and to be able to lyse virus-infected targets in 
vitro. Micklethwaite, et al used the same AD5f35pp65 vector that Baylor used to 
transduce dendritic cells and effectively generated anti-CMV T cell clones that 
significantly improved their patients’ anti-CMV immunity post-transplant without any 
CCHMC IRB# 2019-0229
Version 07.12.201913infusion-related adverse events. (Micklethwaite, 2008). A recent publication by [CONTACT_835543] (2013) demonstrated the effectiveness of a third party VST bank in treating viral 
infections. They generated a bank of 32 virus-specific lines from individuals with 
common HLA polymorphisms immune to CMV, EBV or adenovirus. They were able to 
demonstrate response rates of between 74-78%, with only [ADDRESS_1160117] infusion, and the majority of responders remained virus free at follow-
up. A recent follow-up from the TCH group by [CONTACT_835544] (2017) showed that safe 
and clinically effective VSTs can be generated recognizing CMV, EBV, adenovirus, 
BKV, and HHV-6 (pentavalent VSTs). In this trial, the cumulative complete or partial 
response rate was 92%. Other than one patient who developed a fever within [ADDRESS_1160118] infusions, nor any significant alloreactivity in vitro 
or in-vivo. A recent safety report from the Baylor group reviewed data from more than 180 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835520] 380 infusions of a range of antigen-specific and/or 
engineered T cells and concluded that the treatments are safe (Cruz, 2010). The 
technology we propose to utilize for generating the virus-specific VST is the same 
technology that has been used at Baylor College of Medicine, and elsewhere, for several 
years, in several FDA-approved clinical trials, thus in vitro product efficacy and in vivo 
product safety have been well demonstrated. 
6.1 Safety
As of 12/01/[ADDRESS_1160119] enrolled 120 patients on our donor-derived protocol (CCHMC 
IRB# 2013-2777) with [ADDRESS_1160120] 
this cohort of patients, a significant proportion of viral reactivation occurs between 21 
and 28 days after stem cell infusion. Therefore, there appears to be a potential clinical 
benefit in giving VSTs 21days after stem cell infusion.  
7. RESEARCH PLAN 
7.1 Overview
This study will be conducted in two steps.  
Step 1: Generation of VSTs from consenting donors of eligible donor-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835521] (donors are consented under CCHMC protocol #2013-
2777) 
CCHMC IRB# 2019-0229
Version 07.12.201914Step 2: Use of quadrivalent VSTs in immunocompromised patients at risk for, but 
without active evidence of, viral reactivation or disease. If the patient is deemed 
ineligible for prophylactic infusion due to the presence of viral reactivation or disease, 
they may be eligible for infusion of the same donor-derived VSTs to be given as a 
cellular therapy under CCHMC protocol #2013-2777.
In the first step, consenting donors will donate up to 80 mls of blood (or less in smaller 
donors) and viral specific T-cells will be generated and stored.
In the second step of the study, viral specific VSTs will be infused into recipi[INVESTIGATOR_835522], as defined below.

Plasma BKV PCR ≤ 1,000
●No evidence of invasive adenovirus infection. Adenovirus infection will be defined 
as the presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by [CONTACT_835545]. Adenovirus disease will be 
defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as detected by [CONTACT_835546] 2 sites such as stool or blood or urine or nasopharynx.

in the blood associated with clinical symptoms (adenopathy or fever or masses on 
imaging) but without biopsy confirmation. 
No evidence of symptomatic BK virus infection, which may include symptomatic 
hemorrhagic cystitis.
Patients will not receive any anti-viral treatments beyond Acyclovir intended to prevent 
CMV, EBV, Adenovirus, or BK virus after the VST infusion. Acyclovir is used to prevent 
HSV1/[ADDRESS_1160123] of care in 
patients who are HSV 1 /2  or VZV+. Anti-viral treatment will not be utilized unless there 
is evidence of clinically harmful evidence of invasive viral disease or clinically significant

using the standard CCHMC SOP for infusion of therapeutic T-cells.
7.4.[ADDRESS_1160127] infusion.
- Research samples to assay for the development of viral specific T-cells by 
[CONTACT_835549]. Blood (up to 15 mls) will be obtained for 
CCHMC IRB# 2019-[ADDRESS_1160128] infusion, research 
samples (15 mls) to assay for viral specific T-cell persistence by [CONTACT_835550] 2 weeks for 
4 weeks and then monthly for 12 months where feasible. 
- A research sample (10 mls) will be collected prior to infusion of VSTs from 
patients who received ATG as part of their preparative regimen. These will be 
stored to potentially assay for ATG levels should this cohort of patients have 
poor efficacy in initial review.
- Urine samples may be collected to assess viral genome and assess the 
response in viruria to VST infusions prior to each VST infusion and then weekly 
for [ADDRESS_1160129] infusion. Urine samples will be collected as feasible and/or at the 
discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_835527]. If urine samples are not 
collected at any of these timepoints, it will not be considered a protocol 
deviation.
- This monitoring plan post VST infusion may be modified to less frequent blood 
and/or urine samples if the patient is not residing in the local area post VST 
infusion and collection of research samples poses an undue burden on the 
VST recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Efforts will be made to collect samples locally and have samples 
sent to CCHMC but, if that is not possible, we will collect research samples in 
conjunction with concurrent clinical visits. 
8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This trial is designed to investigate the safety of donor-derived antiviral VSTs given 
prophylactically [ADDRESS_1160130] for 2 years. Previous work in this area predicts that the toxicity of this 
procedure will be low.
In order to reduce patient risk, the study design includes early termination of the trial in 
the event of unacceptable infusional toxicity or new onset severe GvHD during the accrual 
period.  
The study will be closed to accrual pending further evaluation if a high rate of severe 
GVHD (Grade II-IV) develops within [ADDRESS_1160131] infusion, or if unacceptable rates of 
infusional toxicity occur.  If any death attributable to study procedures occurs, enrollment 
will be suspended and the SMC, CCHMC IRB and FDA informed.
A total of 200 patients are to be enrolled sequentially into this single arm trial, with the 
expectation that 122 of these will receive VSTs. The historical rate of grade II-IV GVHD 
within our institution is 15%. To assess safety of the treatment, a Simon two-stage trial 
design will be used. In the first stage, 51 patients will be infused with VSTs. If there are 
more than 15 patients with grade II-IV GVHD, the study will be stopped and the SMC,  
CCHMC IRB# 2019-[ADDRESS_1160132] 
grade II-IV GVHD at any point following infusion. 
The primary endpoint of the study is safety of the infusion of viral specific T-cells.
Infusional toxicity will be monitored using the standard CCHMC therapeutic T-cell 
infusion SOP.  Grades 3 or 4 attributable  toxicity will be considered 
unacceptable.
Patients will be monitored weekly for new onset grades 2-[ADDRESS_1160133] infusion. 
The following table provides stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_835528] 3-4 attributable infusional toxicities. 
For a given set of patients in the left column, if the number of patients with toxicity equals 
or exceeds the number in the right column then enrollment will be suspended and the

9. BENEFIT/RISK ANALYSIS
There is the potential for direct benefit for patients undergoing SCT, as evidenced by 
[CONTACT_835551][INVESTIGATOR_835529]. However, as this is investigational, 
the participants may not receive any benefit from this treatment. The information learned 
from this research study may potentially improve the health care for other patients 
following SCT in the future. 
The study carries a risk of infusional toxicity such as hypertension or fever, and infusion 
of additional cells could cause graft versus host disease. Based on prior reported 
experience, it is expected that toxicity of the procedure will be low.
This study is more than minimal risk but with potential of direct benefit to participants.
10. SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING
10.1 Adverse Event Monitoring

guidelines.
 
Medical conditions/diseases present before VST infusion are only considered adverse 
events if they worsen after VST infusion. Abnormal laboratory values or test results 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered 
clinically significant, or require therapy.
Each sign or symptom reported is documented on the case report form to include the 
start date, stop date, outcome of event, attribution, and whether the event is expected or 
unexpected to the study procedures or underlying disease. Adverse Event reporting 
complies with the current CCHMC IRB policy and applicable federal regulations. If any 
serious adverse events occur, current guidelines will be followed for expedited reporting 
to the IRB. Serious Adverse Event reporting complies with the current CCHMC IRB 
policy and applicable federal regulations.

cannot be guaranteed. Patient information may be disclosed if required by [CONTACT_2371]. The 
FDA, the sponsor and the Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835531].
13. FUTURE RESEARCH 
Data and leftover samples obtained for this study will be stored indefinitely after subject 
study participation is complete and may be used for future research. Data and samples 
will be retained unless the participant chooses to withdraw. If the participant withdraws 
from further study participation, previously collected and stored samples and medical 
information will either be destroyed or stored for future use based on the participant’s 
request and/or permission. Samples and medical information that have already been 
distributed to researchers prior to withdraw of consent as well as any data obtained from 
the distributed samples will not be destroyed. 
The data and/or samples may be used by [CONTACT_7060]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835532]. Only de-identified data and/or 
samples will be provided to researchers at other institutions.

Adverse Events Associated with Stem Cell Transplantation That Do NOT Require 
Reporting
The table overleaf lists expected adverse events associated with stem cell 
transplantation (based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, 
version 4.0). Adverse Events listed that are < grade 3 will not be reported, as these are 
events commonly associated with transplantation. Except in situations described in this 
section, all other adverse events will be reported to the IRB according to current 
guidelines.

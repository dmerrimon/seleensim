Title  An Open -Labe l Study of the Apollo Device for Fatigue in 
Systemic Sclerosis  
Short  title The Apollo in Systemic Sclerosis  
Clinical  study  phase  II 
Study  objective(s)  The primary  objective  of this study  is to provide  preliminary  data on the 
tolerability and efficacy  of the Apollo system for the management of fatigue in 
systemic sclerosis.   
Test device  Apollo System  
Mechanism of use  The Apollo system consists of a wearable device whose frequency of use is 
controlled by [CONTACT_2299].  The participant will install the study mobile 
application on a mobile device  of their choosing.  The wearable device is 
controlled by [CONTACT_433391].    
Location of use  Wrist or ankle  
Duration  of use 4 weeks  
Background  treatment  Patients will continue any existing prescription medication, including 
prednisone and immunosuppressives, at steady doses for 4 weeks prior to 
baseline (visit 1) and during the four-week intervention period.   
Indication  Scleroderma -associated  fatigue

our population to participants with fatigue T -scores of less than 54 (with low 
score indicating high fatigue).  With the range of T -score reduced about  half, 
we expect the standard deviation to be about 5.  The effect size is expected to 
be 1 (5/5) .   
 
Using paired t -test,  we have 86% power to detect the effect size of 1 when we 
recruit 30 patients at  a significance  level of 0.05.  We asked the IRB for the 
option of  increas ing the number of patients to 40, which  will give us about 
81% power to detect a smaller effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_549216]  is fatigue, as measured by [CONTACT_433392] -

The p-values  resulting  from  formal  statistical  tests will be interpreted  from  a 
hypothesis -generating,  rather  than a confirmatory  framework.

1. Introduction  
 
1.1 Background  
 
1.1.1 Scleroderma  (systemic  sclerosis)  
 
Systemic  sclerosis  (SSc)  is an uncommon, multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by  [CONTACT_433393],  immune system activation with a utoantibody  production  and fibroblast  
dysfunction  leading  to increased  deposition of extracellular  matrix.  
 
SSc is an orphan disease  with an incidence of nearly 20 patients per million per year  (1,2)  and an 
estimated point prevalence of approximately 250 per million based on US studies (2).   SSc is a 
female -predominant disease, affecting women three to four times more often than men.   SSc may 
affect individuals of all ages, with the peak incidence o ccurring between 45 and 64 years of age  
(2).   
 
The hallmark of SSc is cutaneous and visceral fibrosis, which is reflected in the commonly used 
term for the disease, scleroderma, which derives from the Greek ‘scleros’ meaning thick and 
‘derma’ referring to  skin. While the cutaneous manifestations are the most obvious, it is the 
vascular and internal organ manifestations that contribute most importantly to disease morbidity 
and mortality.  
 
SSc is described as two primary clinical subsets based on the extent of skin thickening: diffuse 
and limited cutaneous disease.  Patients with limited skin disease have no skin thickening or skin 
thickening limited to the distal extremities (below the elbows and knees, but may have thickness 
of the face). Diffuse cutaneous patients experience similar distal changes, but also develop skin 
thickening proximal to the elbows and knees (upper arms, thighs, trunk) during the disease 
course.  This clinical classification is useful as the natural history of the disease is different 
between the clinical subsets.  Diffuse SSc patients develop progressive skin thickening and 
internal organ involvement early in  their disease (first 2 -3 years).  The natural history of diffuse 
SSc skin thickening is that it may slowly improve over t ime eve n if untreated .  Patients with 
limited SSc tend to develop no or minimal progressive skin changes over time, but may develop 
new internal organ involvement (particularly vascular complications) years into their disease.    
 
Of the connective tissue disease s, SSc has the highest case specific mortality ( 3).   Published 
estimates of mortality consistently report lower survival in the diffuse cutaneous SSc subtype 
compared to the limited SSc subtype (4-7). 
 
SSc has a strong association with morbidity, disabili ty and cost.   Just over twenty years ago 
(1997) Wilson estimated the combined direct and indirect cost of care for SSc patients to be 1.46 
billion dollars annually in the US  (8).  In [ADDRESS_549219] of SSc  per patient to be 22,459 Euros (25,193 USD) ( 9).  Of this, 10,526 Euros 
(11,807 USD) was an indirect cost due to an average SSc patient’s absence from the labor market.   
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_549220]. The term can be used to describe difficulty or inability to initiate activity (subjective sense 
of weakness); reduced capacity to maintain activity (easy fatigability); or difficulty with 
concentration, memory, and emotional stability (mental fatigue) (1 0). Subacute and chronic fatigue 
are common in many rheumatologic conditions, like fibromyalgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, 
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  2 Page  9 of 56 1 February 2021  
1  
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren's syndrome ( 11).  
 
SSc patie nts frequently have fatigue as a characteristic feature of their disease and fatigue negatively 
impacts quality of life ( 12-15). The prevalence of fatigue among SSc patients is 75%, with 61% 
ranking fatigue among their top three most distressing complaints. Fatigue is also associated with 
poor sleep quality, greater pain and depressive symptoms ( 16).  
 
SSc patients, have a prevalence of fatigue that is significantly higher than the general population and 
similar to patients with rheumatoid arthrit is, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
and current cancer treatment ( 17). Fatigue has been identified as one of the main factors negatively 
affecting well -being ( 18) and it’s been associated with fewer visits to doctors (1 9). Fatigue is one of 
the main predictors ( 20, 2 1) of work disability in SSc patients. Correlations have been shown 
between fatigue and high scores on two different depression scales that have been validated in SSc 
patients, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) and t he Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_33547] (CES -D) (22).  
 
Fatigue’s recalcitrance to treatment in SSc patients has been shown in multiple longitudinal studies 
of symptom change over time ( 23-25). In a two -year longitudinal study of scleroderma p atients’ 
change in patient reported outcomes (PROs), fatigue worsened more than the other PROs, which 
included pain, sleep, disability and global health ( 26).  
 
Treatment options for chronic fatigue are limited and the prognosis is not favorable ( 27). When the 
underlying medical cause of fatigue cannot be treated, treatment options include Cognitive 
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exercise ( 28, 29) . If SSc patients exhibit depressive symptoms, 
treatment can involve an empi[INVESTIGATOR_433374] ( 30). A systematic review of chronic 
fatigue’s prognosis found that less than 10% of participants returned to pre -morbid levels of 
functioning, 10 -20% worsened, and most remained significantly impaired.  Risk factors for fatigue’s 
poor prognosis are often prese nt in SSc patients, and include older age, more chronic illness, having 
a comorbid psychiatric disorder and holding a belief that the illness is due to physical causes (21).

like vibrations to the body that improve autonomic nervous syste m tone in near real time (Siegle & 
Rabin et al., under review).  Apollo is about the size of an Apple Watch and can be worn on the 
ankle, wrist, or arm  with two adjustable fabric straps.  Apollo vibrations activate touch receptors in 
the skin and are perceiv ed as safety signals by [CONTACT_433394], improved 
recovery, focus, and energy.   
 
In addition to the wearable, Apollo is a software system that curates music for the body, rather than 
for the ears. The scientific principles guiding t he use of Apollo and our mechanistic understanding 
of its effects on the body are consistent with our understanding of how music and therapeutic touch 
effect the body to convey feelings of energy, focus, or relaxation  by [CONTACT_433395] (limbic system) in the brain . Similar to music and touch used to facilitate a healing 
response in the body, there are no known side effects to this type of therapy.   
 
Prior studies of Apollo have demonstrated significant improv ements in  fatigue and energy in healthy 
subjects in the real world as well as in subjects with chronic illnesses in clinical trials of Apollo  
within just a few days of use . Early findings strongly suggest that by [CONTACT_433396], 
Apollo is attenuating biom arkers of persistent unwanted sympathetic activity, such as low heart rate 
variability (HRV), that over time, correlate with worse prognoses in many chronic illnesses.  Low 
HRV is also a predictive factor in fatigue and poor energy recovery. Not only has Ap ollo been 
demonstrated to improve HRV and decrease heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], blood pressure, and other

patterns in the vasculature (study data under analysis), which are known to correspond with nitric 
oxide release.  As such, there is significant reason to believe that Apollo will improve symptoms of 
fatigue , inflammation, and vascular dysfunction  in subjects with S Sc.

Risk of breach of confidentiality: All study  data collected via the Apollo HIPAA -compliant mobile 
app will be de -identified and regi stered to a specific study email account that is not linked to any 
identifiable information from the user.   All paper d ocuments (including consent forms) will be kept 
in a locked filing cabinet  inside of a locked office. In addition, an ongoing review of st udy 
procedures will be done to  ensure that the privacy of subjects and confidentiality of data is not 
violated. All data will be  deidentified with a password protected master list as the only linkage 
between names and  subject identification numbers. Consen t forms, as well as any forms with 
identifiable  information listed will be kept in a locked filing cabinet, separately from each subjects

The Apollo system has been tested and independently validated by [CONTACT_433398] a number 
of different institutions in the military and many Veterans, several academics at Universities, >[ADDRESS_549225].  The Company has over 2000  beta testers and 
has conducted over 500 long -term case studies with consistent results. The technology proposed 
here has also been t ested in children (as young as  age 4 ), geriatric users, and other extremely 
vulnerable populations (such as those with treatment -resistant PTSD) without any reported adverse 
reactions.  
 
Participants will be informed about any and all potential risks. There are no known long -term risks 
to the subjects from any of the study  procedures, which have been used safely on  
thousands of men, women, and children. All study personnel examine screenin g materials  
before asking the participant to engage in any of the study activities in order to minimize  the risks 
associated with the study procedures. If any additional physiological or mental health conditions are 
revealed  during the screening or enrollm ent, they will be discussed individually with the clinical 
team ( [CONTACT_104726]  et al. ) prior to officially enrolling the subject in the study. If results are best 
discussed with the  participant's physician, the participant will be offered the opportunity to complete 
a release of information form allowing [CONTACT_104726]  to contact [CONTACT_2299]'s physician directly.

4. STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.[ADDRESS_549228] of care medications  for the management 
of SSc a s background  therapy.   
 
The study  design  consists  of a single, four-week intervention.  The screening and baseline visits 
can be combined  when the screening is not able to be performed over the phone  in advance .   
 
• Screening  phase:  up to 4 weeks  prior to baseline visit  
 
• Observation period:   During this one week phase participants will track their daily 
Raynaud  attack frequency and duration using a diary.  This will occur in the seven days 
preceding the baseline intervention phase.   
 
• Open-label intervention phase :  This consists of a four -week period during which 
participants will use the Apollo wearable  system as needed to manage symp toms 
including fatigue . During the intervention  phase  participants may use the wearable at 
their discretion and control.  Participants will track their daily Raynaud attack frequency 
and duration using a diary during  week 4 of Apollo use.  Participants will complete 
questionnaires on day 1 of the open -label and intervention phase, and at their follow -up 
four weeks later.    
 
 
4.1.1 Screening  phase (up to 4 weeks  prior to baseline visit ) 
 
After  providing  written  informed  consent, participants  will undergo  a screening  evaluation  to 
determine their eligibility  (see Section  7.1 for a detailed schedule  of events).   Participants  will 
complete  the PROMIS -Fatigue  scale to determine if they have moderate to severe fatigue.  If a T 
score of 45 is obtained, and all inclusio n criteria are met, then the pa tient may proceed  to the 
observation phase .   Participants will be given the 7 -day diary to be completed starting one week 
prior to their scheduled baseline visit.  They will be reminded be telephone call or text (based on 
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  2 Page  14 of 56 1 February 2021   
their preference) to begin their diary collection.  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_549229]  met all of the inclusion  criteria.  At this visit they will 
complete the following questionnaires :  
1) PROMIS -fatigue  
2) PROMIS -29  
3) The QUIDS -SR 
4) HAQ -DQ with SHAQ  
5) Raynaud condition score , Raynaud visual analog scale and digital ulcer visual analog 
scale  
 
 
They will then be provided the wearable Apollo system device.  They will download the mobile 
application, and be taught how to install it and use it to control the wearable Apollo device by 
[CONTACT_23164](s).  Any questions will be answered  at this time .  Participants will be 
able to use the device from the time they leave the visit.  Use of the device will be entirely at the 
subject’s control.    
 
In the week prior to their end -of-study visit, participants will complete a daily diary collection of 
Raynaud attack epi[INVESTIGATOR_433379].  This will be provided prior to 
leaving the baseline visit.    
 
Participan ts will b e sent a reminder call or text the day before and day they are to begin their diary 
collection on one week prior to their scheduled end -of-study visit.

5.1.[ADDRESS_549232] -like vibrations to the body that improve autonomic nervous syste m tone in near real time 
(Siegle & Rabin et al., under review). Apollo is about the size of an Apple Watch and can be worn 
on the ankle, wrist, or arm with two adjustable fabric straps. Apollo vibrations activate touch 
receptors in the skin and are perceiv ed as safety signals by [CONTACT_433394], 
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  [ADDRESS_549233] the body to convey feelings of energy, focus, or relaxation  by [CONTACT_433395] (limbic system) in the brain . Similar to music and touch used to facilitate a 
healing response in the body, there are no known side effects to this type of therapy.   
 
Prior studies of Apollo have demonstrated significant improvements in fatigue  and energy in 
healthy subjects in the real world as well as in subjects with chronic illnesses in clinical trials of 
Apollo within just a few days of use. Early findings strongly suggest that by [CONTACT_433401], Apollo is attenuating biomarkers o f persistent unwanted sympathetic activity, such as low 
heart rate variability (HRV), that over time, correlate with worse prognoses in many chronic 
illnesses. Low HRV is also a predictive factor in fatigue and poor energy recovery. Not only has 
Apollo bee n demonstrated to improve HRV and decrease heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], blood pressure, 
and other markers of stress when threat is misappropriated, but it also appears to be inducing 
Meyer wave patterns in the vasculature (study data under analysis), which ar e known to 
correspond with nitric oxide release. As such, there is significant reason to believe that Apollo will 
improve symptoms of fatigue, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction in subjects with SSc.  
 
Storage requirements:  
 
All wearable devices not in use during  the trial will be stored  at the investigational  sites at room  
temperature  in a place  inaccessible  to unauthorized personnel, i.e. in a locked  cabinet.   No 
special storage conditions  are required.  
 
6.2 Treatment  assignment  
 
This is an open -label, single -arm trial.  No randomization or blinding will occur.    
 
6.4.3 Special  populations  
The Apollo wearable has been used in a wide array of populations.    No adjustments need to be 
made in use or instructions.  
 
 
6.5 Device use  and compliance  
 
The Apollo system including wearable hardware and software will track each subjects’ use of 
Apollo throughout the study. This usage data will be  stored in HIPAA -compliant manner and  
linked to a de -identified study subject ID number .  
 
If a participant reduces or stops use of the Apollo wearable, this data will be recorded.  The 
participant will still complete the two week (end of study) visit and assessment as planned.

7.5 Safety  
 
7.5.1 Adverse events  
The Apollo system has been tested and independently validated by [CONTACT_433398] a 
number of different institutions in the military and many Veterans, several academics at 
Universities, >[ADDRESS_549236].  The Company has 
over 2000  beta testers and has conducted over 500 long -term case studies with consistent results. 
The technology proposed here has also been t ested in children (as young as 4yo), geriatric users, 
and other extremely vulnerable populations (such as those with treatment -resistant PTSD) without 
any reported adverse reactions.  
 
Participants will be informed about any and all potential risks. There a re no known long -term risks 
to the subjects from any of the study  procedures, which have been used safely on  
thousands of men, women, and children. All study personnel examine screening materials  
before asking the participant to engage in any of the study activities in order to minimize  the risks 
associated with the study procedures. If any additional physiological or mental health conditions 
are revealed  during the screening or enrollment , they will be discussed individually with the clinical 
team ( [CONTACT_104726]  et al. ) prior to officially enrolling the subject in the study. If results are best 
discussed with the  participant's physician, the participant will be offered the opportunity to 
complete a release of information form allowing [CONTACT_104726]  to contact [CONTACT_2299]'s physician 
directly.  
 
Should any adverse events be detected/reported/observed by [CONTACT_433405], subjects may  
easily  discontinue use of the Apollo system immediately either by:  
1) Turning the wearable off with the buttons on the devi ce or  
2) Removing the wearable from their body  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions 
Definition of adverse event  
(AE)  
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  [ADDRESS_549237]  medical  occurrence  (i.e., any unfavorable and  
unintended sign [including  abnormal laboratory  findings],  symptom  or disease)  in a patient  or 
clinical  investigation participant  after providing  written  informed  consent  for participation  in the 
study.   Therefore,  an AE may or may not be temporally  or causally  associated  with the use of a 
medicinal  (investigational)  product.  
 
A surgical  procedure that was planned  prior  to the start of the study  by [CONTACT_433406] (however,  the condition  for which  the surgery  is 
required  may be an AE).  
 
In the following  different iation  between  medical  history  and AEs,  the term “condition”  may 
include  abnormal  physical  examination  findings,  symptoms,  diseases,  laboratory  results,  and 
ECG  findings.  
 
• Conditions  that started  before  signing  of informed  consent  and for which no symptoms  or 
treatment  are present  until signing  of informed  consent  are recorded  as medical  history  
(e.g.,  seasonal allergy  without acute  complaints).  
• Conditions  that started  before  signing  of informed  consent  and for which symptoms  or 
treatment  are present after signing  of informed  consent,  at unchanged  intensity , are 
recorded  as medical  history  (e.g.,  allergic  pollinosis).  
• Conditions  that started  or deteriorated  after signing  of informed  consent  will be 
documented  as AEs. 
 
Definition of serious  adverse event  (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  that, at any  dose, meets  any of the 
following  criteria  (a – f): 
 
a. Results  in death  
 
b. Is life-threatening  
 
The term ‘life-threatening’  in the definition  refers  to an event  in which  the participant  
was at risk of death  at the time of the event,  it does not refer to an event  which  
hypothetically  might  have  caused death  if it were  more  severe.  
 
c. Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909]  
 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433381]: 
 
- The admission  results  in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154075] 12 hours  
- The admission  is pre-planned  
(i.e., elective or scheduled  surgery  arranged  prior to the start of the study)  
- The admission  is not associated  with an AE 
(e.g.,  social  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433382]).  
 
However,  it should  be noted  that invasive treatment  during  any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433383] ‘medically  important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE  
dependent  on clinical  judgment.   In addition,  where  local regulatory  authorities  
specifically  require  a more  stringent  definition,  the local regulation  takes  precedence.  
 
d. Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  / incapacity  
 
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  2 Page  21 of 56 1 February 2021   
Disability  means  a substantial  disruption of a person’s  ability  to conduct  normal  life’s  
functions.  
 
e. Is a congenital  anomaly  / birth defect  
 
f. Is another  medically  important  serious  event  as judged by [CONTACT_093]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classifications  for adverse event  assessment  
 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_433407].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_549238]  be determined according  to the criteria  given  in Section   
[IP_ADDRESS]  . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Severity  
 
The severity  of an AE is classified  according  to the following  categories:  
- Grade 1 Mild  
- Grade 2 Moderate  
- Grade 3 Severe  
- Grade 4 Very  Severe  
- Grade 5 Death  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Causal relationship  
 
The assessment  of the causal  relationship between  an AE and the administration of treatment  is a 
clinical  decision  based on all available  information  at the time of the completion .  The 
assessment  is based on the question  whether  there  was a “reasonable causal  relationship”  to the 
study  treatment in question.  
 
Possible answers  are “Related ” or “Not Related ” An assessment  of “Not Related ” would  include:  
 
1. The existence of a clear  alternative explanation,  or  
2. Non-plausibility,  e.g., the participant  is struck  by [CONTACT_433408];  cancer  
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a few days after the first drug administration.  
 
An assessment  of “Related ” indicates  that there  is a reasonable  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_433384].  
 
Important  factors  to be considered  in assessing  the relationship of the AE to study  treatment  
include:  
 
- The temporal  sequence   
- Recovery  on discontinuation  (de-challenge),  recurrence on drug re-introduction  (re- 
challenge):  
- Underlying,  concomitant,  intercurrent  diseases:  
- Concomitant  medication or treatment:  The other drugs  the participant is 
taking  or the treatment  the participant receives  should  be examined  to determine 
whether  any of them may  be suspected  to cause  the event  in question.  
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  2 Page  22 of 56 1 February 2021   
 
Causal relationship  to protocol -required  procedure(s)  
 
The assessment  of a possible causal  relationship between  the AE and protocol -required  
procedure(s)  is based on the question  whether  there  was a “reasonable causal  relationship”  to 
protocol -required procedure(s).  
 
Possible answers  are “yes”  or “no” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action  taken  with study  treatment  
 
Any action  on study  treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using  the categories  listed  
below.  
 
- Device use stopped  
- Device use interrupted  
- No change  
Not applicable  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5  Other  specific  treatment(s)  of adverse events  
 
- None  
- Remedial  drug therapy  
- Other  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].6  Outcome  
 
The outcome  of the AE is to be documented  as follows:  
 
- Recovered/resolved  without  sequelae  
- Recovered/resolved  with sequelae  
- Not recovered/not  resolved  (ongoing)  
- Fatal  
- Unknown  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessments  and documentation  of adverse events  
 
The investigator  has the obligation to  report AEs.  All non -serious events  will be assessed  and 
recorded during  the specified  observational  phase  (from  signing  the informed  consent  form  up to 
30 [+5] days after last study  medication  intake),  whether believed  to be related or unrelated  to 
the treatment.  AE forms  will be included .  The record  will include clinical  symptoms  or final 
diagnosis  when  available,  date of appearance,  duration,  severity  and relationship  to treatment.  
A record  will also be kept of the action taken  and the  follow -up until resolution of the AE. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting  of serious  adverse events   
Notification  of the IECs  / IRBs  
 
Notification of the IECs  / IRBs  about  all relevant  events  (e.g.,  SAEs, suspected,  unexpected,  
serious  adverse reactions  [S[LOCATION_003]Rs])  will be performed by [CONTACT_433409]  (as defined  in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  ) are applicable.  
 
7.6 OTHER PROCEDURES AND VARIABLES  
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  2 Page  23 of 56 1 February 2021   
 
 
7.6.1 Raynaud’s attacks  assessment  
 
Raynaud’s  attacks  will be assessed using  the composite  of the following  6 individual  outcome  
measures  in order  to minimize the measurement  variability  and placebo  response( 7): Raynaud’s  
condition score,  patient  assessment  of Raynaud’s  phenomenon,  physician  assessment  of 
Raynaud’s phenomenon,  attack  symptoms,  duration of attacks,  and number of attacks  per day. 
 
The Raynaud’s  condition  score  is a daily  patient  assessment  of Raynaud’s  phenomenon  activity  
using  a 0-[ADDRESS_549239]  of Raynaud’s  phenomenon  attacks,  reflecting  the overall  degree that Raynaud’s has  
affected  use of the participan t’s hands.  The Raynaud’s  condition score,  along  with details  of the 
frequency  and duration of Raynaud’s  attacks,  will be incorporated  into the daily  diary  that 
participants  will be asked  to complete for 1 week  (7 days)  at the time points  shown below.  
The patient and physician  assessment  assesses  the severity  of Raynaud’s phenomenon  in the past 
week  using  a 0-100 VAS.  
 
Frequency:  The d iary is to be completed by [CONTACT_433410]-day during the observation period, 
and one -day at the end of study (to occur the day prior to end of study visit).   
 
7.6.2 Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms  (QUIDS -SR) 
The QUIDS -SR is a 16-item questionnaires that evaluates depression.  The 
QUIDS -SR has been validated and used to screen, diagnose, monitor and measure 
the severity of depression.   
 
7.6.3 Patient -Reported  Outcomes  (PROs)  / Health -Related  Quality of Life (HRQoL)  
questionnaires  
 
Three patient -reported outcomes  (PROs) —the HAQ -DI/SHAQ,  and PROMIS -29— will be 
completed by [CONTACT_433411].   
 
Scleroderma  Health Assessment  Questionnaire  (HAQ -DI/SHAQ)  
 
The HAQ -DI consists of [ADDRESS_549240] week.   It additionally  measures  
5 domains  specific to  scleroderma  using  a continuous  VAS:  Raynaud’s phenomenon,  digital  tip 
ulcers, lung  symptoms,  gastrointestinal  symptoms,  and a global  patient  assessment.  The VAS  
subscales  of the SHAQ  were  shown  to be significantly  correlated  with objective parameters  and 
were  responsive  to change in a cohort and in a Raynaud’s phenomenon  trial in SSc. The SHAQ  
requires  approximately  5 minutes  to complete.  
 
Patient -Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information  System  (PROMIS) -29 
 
The PROMIS -29 is a validated instrument  to measure  the health status  of SSc patients,  
demonstrating  moderate  to high correlation  with other instruments  validated  in SSc, including  
the SF-36 physical  component  score  and HAQ -DI. It incorporates  7 core domains  from  the 
PROMIS  questionnaire,  which specifically  relate  to physical,  mental, and social health  aspects  of 
chronic  illness:  pain, fatigue,  depression, anxiety,  sleep, and physical  function, as well as one 
11-point rating  scale for pain intensity.  It contains  8 items  with 29 weighted  responses  in total,  
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  2 Page  24 of 56 1 February 2021   
 
 
 
and requires  approximately  5 minutes  to complete.  
 
7.6.4 Participant  and Physician  Global  Assessment  
 
A global assessment  for patient  and physician  will be obtained.  
 
The participant assessment  represents  the patient’s  assessment  of the patient’s  global  
scleroderma  on a 0-10 Likert  scale. “On a scale of [ADDRESS_549241] 
week? 0=Excellent;  10=Extremely  Poor.  The  physician  global assessment represents  the 
physician’s  assessment  of the patient’s  current  disease  activity  on a 0-10 Likert  scale. “On a 
scale of  0-10, how was your patient’s  overall  health  in the last week? 0=Excellent;  10=Extremely  
Poor”. Both  assessments  are made  at baseline  and Week  16, OLE  Week  0 and OLE  Week  16. 
 
8. Statistical  methods  and determination  of sample  size 
 
8.1 General  considerations  
 
This section presents  a summary  of the planned statistical  analyses.  A statistical  analysis  plan 
(SAP) will be written  for the study  that contains  detailed  descriptions  of the analyses  to be 
performed.   The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding  of the data.  
 
Continuous  variables  will be summarized using  descriptive statistics  including  n, mean,  median,  
standard  deviation, range (e.g.,  minimum and maximum).  Qualitative variables  will be 
summarized using  counts and  percentages.   Graphical  methods  will be used in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_433385].   
 
Unless  otherwise  specified,  statistical  analyses  will be performed  using  SAS Version  9 or higher.  
Where  appropriate,  statistical  tests will be conducted  at the 0.05 significance level  (with  no 
adjustments  for multiplicity)  using  two-tailed  tests and p-values  will be reported.  
 
Given  the rare nature  of SSc and the consequent  small sample  size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  the 
statistical  power of any  comparisons is limited  (i.e., there  is sufficient  power to  detect  only 
large treatment  differences). As such the analysis  will be largely  descriptive in nature.  The p- 
values  resulting  from formal  statistical  tests will be interpreted  from  a hypothesis -generating,  
rather  than a confirmatory  framework.  
 
Analysis sets 
 
As this is an open -label study, all participant who have used the Apollo system wearable for at 
least one dose (one day) will be analyzed.  The primary  endpoint and all secondary  outcomes 
will be assessed using  this analysis  set.   
 
 
Investigator  Study  Protocol  No.: Version  [ADDRESS_549242] to allow  for covariate  adjustment (9).  
This rank ANCOVA  can provide additional  power associated  with baseline  covariate  adjustment,  
even  when  the outcome variable  is not  normally  distributed 1(10).  
 
Analysis  for secondary  outcome measures  that are continuous  will be performed using  a similar  
approach  as that for the primary  endpoint.  We will compare  the change in each secondary  
outcome measure  from  baseline  to week  2 using  an ANCOVA  model  or its non-parametric  
counterpart if the  model  assumptions  aren’t  met. Analyses  of secondary  outcomes  measures  that 
are discrete  will be performed using  Fisher’s  exact  tests. Analyses  of secondary  outcome  
measure  that are counts  will be performed using  Poisson  regression.  
 
8.3.3 Safety  
 
Descriptive summary  statistics  for ] adverse and serious  adverse events  will be reported. 
Adverse events  will be grouped by [CONTACT_433412];  serious  adverse events  will be enumerated  and described  as appropriate.   
 
 
8.4 Planned  interim  analyses  
 
No formal  interim  analysis  of this short, two -week study will be performed.  
 
8.5 Determination  of sample  size 
 
SSc is a rare disease.  The planned  minimum  sample  size of 30 SSc participants  is based on 
practical  considerations  to obtain preliminary  estimates of the magnitude  of treatment  
differences  in efficacy  and safety  rather than a desired power for a  pre-specified  difference  as 
would be necessary  for a confirmatory  study.  However,  with this proposed sample  of 30 
participants  we can calculate the magnitude  of treatment  differences  (riociguat  – placebo) for 
the primary  efficacy  endpoint  – the change from baseline  to end of double -blind  treatment  in 
fatigue scales.  There  would  be 80% power to  detect  an effect  size (mean  treatment  difference 
divided by [CONTACT_433413])  of While we expect that [ADDRESS_549243] written this protocol to allow

3. Abstract : 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_615183] (SCIs). 
Nearly one -quarter of all SCI  cases involve injury to the upper spi[INVESTIGATOR_615184].  Although mechanical 
ventilation can be life -saving after cervical SCI (C -SCI), it also triggers rapid and profound 
diaphragm muscle atrophy, thereby [CONTACT_615264] (or even preventing) ventilator weaning. 
Intramuscular diaphragm stimulation, or diaphragm pacing, was developed to replace long -term 
ventilator support and is now used acutely post C -SCI (<4 months following i njury) to promote 
ventilator weaning. Our group is part of a national team that initially  reported 80% of C -SCI 
patients who underwent diaphragm pacing were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation. 
Moreover, following electrode placement, gains in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615185]; remarkably, 
36% of patients who received diaphragm pacing recovered independent breathing, enabling 
removal of the pacing electrodes.  More recently,  our team assessed the effects of diaphragm 
stimulation (pacing) longitu dinally, from days to weeks after onset of diaphragm  pacing  
demonstrating improvements in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615186] (details 
below) . However, there are clear gaps in how such data can be interpreted to determine the 
unique effects o f diaphragm pacing since many factors affected outcomes in our longitudinal 
assessments (i.e. patient comorbidities, secondary complications after SCI, variances in ICU care, 
etc). Thus, these  newly proposed experiments will examine the effects of diaphragm stimulation 
within carefully controlled test session s and examine effects immediately after a controlled 
period of stimulation . This will allow us to determine the unique effects of diaphragm stimulation. 
Specifically, w e will measure respi[INVESTIGATOR_615187] ~1-hour time blocks and a single ~[ADDRESS_815869] and breathing function in individuals with acute, 
traumatic C -SCI.

indeed, individuals with cervical lesions are at the greatest risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_615188].1-[ADDRESS_815871] injury (C -SCI) causes  primary neurological 
impairment of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458]. Since 40% of C -SCI cases involve C1 to C5 injury, 
phrenic nerve activation will be impaired, weakening diaphragm contractions. Although 
mechanical ventilation can be lifesaving after C -SCI, it tr iggers rapid and profound diaphragm 
muscle atrophy, thereby [CONTACT_615265].4,[ADDRESS_815872] ventilator support and is 
now used acutely  to promote ventilator weaning in individuals with C -SCIs (< [ADDRESS_815873] C -
SCI).6  Our group is part of a national team that reported that the majority (80%) of patients with 
C-SCI who received diaphragm pacing were subsequently weaned from mechanical ventilation.  
Diaphragm pacing may improve respir atory function since 36% of patients receiving diaphragm 
pacing recovered independent breathing , enabling removal of the pacing electrodes.6   
 More recently , our team assessed the effects of diaphragm stimulation (pacing) longitudinally, 
from days to weeks after onset of diaphragm pacing  and showed improvements in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615189], forced vital capacity, and maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_400463].  Preliminary analyses also highlight increased EMG diaphragm activation  evident after 
use of pacing . Thus, accumulat ing evidence suggests  that diaphragm pacing exceeds the current 
standard of care ( i.e. mechanical ventilation), and may represent a rehabilitation strategy to 
improve and even restore lost respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] . However, there are clear gaps in how such 
data can be interpreted to determine the unique effects of diaphragm pacing since many factors 
affected outcomes in our longitudinal assessments (i.e. patient comorbidities, secondary 
complications after SCI, variances in ICU care, etc). Thus, a primary goal in this protocol  is to 
examine the effects of diaphragm stimulation within  carefully controlled test session s. Here, we 
propose to systematically evaluat e the impact of diaphragm pacing on diaphragm neuromuscular 
activation (EMGs) and breathing capacity after two ~1-hour time blocks and a single ~12 -hour 
time block  of diaphragm stimulation  in adults with acute, traumatic C -SCIs.  This work represents 
an ess ential step in determining the efficacy of intramuscular diaphragm stimulation and its effects 
on respi[INVESTIGATOR_615190] C -SCI.  
Research AIM :  
The aim of this protocol is t o test the hypothesis that diaphragm pacing enhances 
neuromuscular activation of the diaphragm in adults with C -SCIs and improves respi[INVESTIGATOR_2606]. We will test the hypothesis by [CONTACT_615266]  
(electromyograms; EMGs)  from i ntramuscular pacing electrodes. Recording from these surgically 
implanted electrodes allows comparisons of electromyogram recordings before and after short 
periods of diaphragm pacing to better isolate the unique contribution of diaphragm pacing on 
neuromu scular diaphragm activation.  This approach, in association with re spi[INVESTIGATOR_185212], 
will enable us to better determine the unique  impact of diaphragm pacing in patients with acute, 
traumatic C -SCIs.

atelectasis and altered breathing mechanics.13 In 40% of C -SCI cases, the upper cervical 
segments (C1 -C5) are involved,3 causing severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_88739]; these individuals often 
require mechanical vent ilation.  More than two -thirds of acute C -SCI patients will require 
ventilatory support (usually mechanical ventilation), and 40% will require continued ventilatory 
support after discharge from acute care.[ADDRESS_815874] demonstrated that mechanical ventilation induces diaphragm dysfunction,16 a syndrome 
known as ventilator -induced diaphragm dysfunc tion or VIDD.17,18  VIDD has been observed in 
animal models19 and humans18,20,21 with prolonged ventilatory support.  Even brief periods (18 -
69 hours) of mechanical ventilation cause atrophy.20,[ADDRESS_815875] -injury.25,26

be recruited from UF Health Shands Jacksonville, a Level -[ADDRESS_815881]. Brian

Of note, we  will aim to recruit and enroll participants once they are scheduled to undergo 
diaphragm pacing (i.e. before pacer placement) so that the baseline tests can be pe rformed 
prior to implantation and post-implant  assessments can be performed shortly after implantation 
of the diaphragm pacer.  We recognize that this process may not always be feasible  due to 
complexities in the patient’s medical condition or status. In some cases a patient may undergo 
implantation of the diaphragm pacer and the device may not be turned on for days. We, 
therefore,  may enroll participants up to [ADDRESS_815883] .  Yorkgitis   provide s medical care and /or perform s surgical diaphragm pacer 
implantation to this C -SCI population, he will identify potential participants who meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The specified criteria (determination of SCI injury level and status, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806], medical history ) are routinely part of this patient population’s medical care 
and medical history. If a potential participant would like to learn more about the study, detailed 
information will be provided to the patient and their caregivers/family.  The informed consent  
document will be used to guide this process. [CONTACT_615277]   also will notify the PI, [CONTACT_48376]  or a 
study Co -I that a patient would like to learn about the study and may be potentially interested in 
enrolling.  Study coordinators, Jennifer Mull or Yohan Dia z Zuniga, who work closely with the 
study physicians, also may notify [CONTACT_48376] and study Co -I. Based on this, [CONTACT_48376] and/or a study 
Co-I will discuss the study with the patient and caregivers/family.

 Assessment Overview:  We will study a small cohort of patients with acute C-SCIs following 
implantation of intramuscular diaphragm pacing wires.  All individuals will meet inclusion criteria 
and will complete the informed consent process. Experiments are designed to determine if 
diaphragm stimulation (pacing) can produce neuroplastic  changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615202]. Neural drive to the diaphragm will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_615270] (EMGs) from the intramuscular pacing wires following each of 3 
blocks  of diaphragm stimulat ion (Figure 3). Concurrent with these recordings from the 
diaphragm, respi[INVESTIGATOR_615203].  
Diaphragm EMGs  will be recorded from the intramuscular diaphragm pacing electrodes and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_615204] -stimulated respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (diaphragm pacing unit 
turned off).   Diaphragm EMGs will be recorded from the intramuscular pacing electrodes with a 
custom connector that attaches to the external pacing electrode wires and interfaces with an 
EMG acquisition system. Concurrent with EMG recordings, each assessment will include tests 
of maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_615205].  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_615206] (tidal 
breathing, forced vital capacity or FVC).  
To classify the level and severity of each subject’s C -SCI, a clinical ASIA neurologic 
examinati on will be performed in accordance with the International Standards for Neurological 
Classification of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751]. This standardized clinical examination will allow us to 
characterize segmental sensory and motor function.   
Baseline Assessments  
After obtaining informed consent for participation in the study, [CONTACT_48376] or designated members 
of the study team (Alicia K. Vose, PhD, Kathryn Doughty ( Cavka ), DPT) will review the 
participant’s medical records to obtain study -related medical and demographic data. Information 
obtained from the medical record will include information pertaining to health and medical 
history, details pertaining to the SCI, reports of medications and test results that could influence 
the individual’s participation in the research  procedures. .  Additionally, c linical  tests of sensory 
and motor function will be conducted to classify the level and severity of the individual’s SCI.  
The tests of sensory and motor function are part of the American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_222597] 
(ASIA) Impai rment Scale and the International Standards for Neurological Classification of 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17751].  These clinical assessments are part of standard clinical care and include 
tests of sensation (dermatomes) and muscle strength via manual muscle testing (myo tomes). 
These routine, standardized tests are done to clinically determine which segmental levels of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_615207].  These tests also aid in determining if the 
SCI is clinically complete or incomplete.  Determinati on of complete vs. incomplete is based on 
the sensory and motor function in the lowest sacral segments which control sensation and 
motor function at the anal sphincter.  These standardized clinical tests are part of routine 
examination following spi[INVESTIGATOR_34407] d injury.

diaphragm pacer implantation (Figure 3). Baseline respi[INVESTIGATOR_615209] (tidal breathing, forced vital capacity or FVC) and maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_400463]. We recognize that enrolling patients prior to diaphragm pacer placement may not 
always be feasible and we, therefore, may enroll particip ants up to 5 -days following pacer 
implantation and will not obtain baseline (pre -implant) respi[INVESTIGATOR_615210].

 Following diaphragm pacer placement, the pre -stimulation asse ssment (prior to turning on the 
diaphragm stim ulation ) will be initiated approximately  18-[ADDRESS_815884] of practice based on the procedures used by [CONTACT_615271]  ([CONTACT_615277]).  For individuals enrolled within [ADDRESS_815885] breaks will be provided. The participant will be closely

 *Given the medical co ndition of these participants, we will adjust timing or omit a test if 
necessary, as to not interfere with the participant’s  medical care.  Furthermore, the timing of 
tests and d uration of stimulation may vary slightly given the constraints of patients bei ng in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) and coordination with nurses, physicians , and ICU scheduling. 
Additionally, these parameters may vary based on the safety and medical monitoring of each 
subject as directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Yorkgitis .* 
During the assessments, photographs and/or video recordings may be obtained.  These 
recordings will be done with the participant’s knowledge and consent for the type of recording 
being obtained.  Photographs and video recordings will be used to communicate  study 
procedures with the study team and to monitor the assessment process.  Video and 
photographic data will be used to assess how individuals with SCIs perform and respond to the 
testing and to communicate the study procedures.  Video and photographic i nformation will be 
used in a manner based on the level of consent obtained from each participant.    
Diaphragm Stimulation : This protocol will not alter the implantation of the diaphragm pacer . This 
study will assess those who have received or who are plan ned to receive the device based on 
their medical needs and prior medical assessments (not associated with this study).  Diaphragm 
stimulation settings are determined intraoperatively or immediately postoperatively by [CONTACT_37040] ([CONTACT_615277]) to maximize stimulation effectiveness and also to ensure patient comfort.  
Parameters such as stimulation amplitude, frequency , and breaths per minute are adjusted 
within a pre -set range based on the device usage guidelines.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_615212] 15 -25mA at a 
frequency of 30 or 50Hz, and at a rate of 12 -18 breaths per minute;39,[ADDRESS_815888] stimulation

Assessment of neuromuscular activation of the diaphragm.  Neuromuscular activation of the 
diaphragm will be assessed by [CONTACT_615272] -implanted 
intramuscular stimulating electrodes.11,75  This approach will allow for com parisons of EMG 
recordings across time and reduces the methodological limitations associated with surface or 
percutaneous EMG approaches.9  EMGs will be recorded during non -stimulated respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] 
(diaphragm pacer turned off) and simultaneously with assessments of respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806].  
These assessments may include maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_615213].76,77  
Primary outcomes to characterize neuromuscular activation of the diaphragm and assess 
changes in diaphragm activation associated with intramuscular diaphra gm stimulation will 
include: amplitude and timing characteristics (raw, filtered EMGs and normalized);76,[ADDRESS_815889] to evaluate diaphragm muscle activation during tidal breathing relative to

characteristics of the diaphragm EMGs (wavelet analysis).75,79-81  Methods pertaining to 
diaphragm EMG signal acquisition and processing are explained below.   
Diaphragm EMG acquisition and signal processing.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_615214].69,70  EMGs will be recorded from the externalized pacing 
wires which connected to each of four intramuscular electrodes (2 in each hemidiaphragm).  
The implanted, remote sub -cutaneous electrode will serve as the ground.11  A custom -connector 
(Synapse Biomedical, Oberlin, OH) will be used to link the exposed pacing wires to our EMG 
acquisition system.  EMG signals will be amplified and band pass filtered (10 Hz to 1000 Hz), 
acquired at a sa mpling frequency of 2 kHz, and saved to a computer for off -line analysis.   
To acquire the diaphragm EMG signals, the pacer will be shut off to allow connection to the 
EMG acquisition system.  It is feasible to shut off the diaphragm pacer for several reas ons.

Whitney U will be used to test for difference s in the EMG and respi[INVESTIGATOR_615225].  
Interpretation and possible outcomes   If study outcomes are consistent with our preliminary 
data6-8,[ADDRESS_815897] to demonstrate increased neuromuscular 
activation of the diaphragm and improved respi[INVESTIGATOR_615226] 12 of 19

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] :  2/3/[ADDRESS_815898] and that 
diaphragm pacing is a therapeutic strategy to promote respi[INVESTIGATOR_615227] C -SCI.  Further, 
changes in neuromuscular activation would provide evidence that diaphragm pacing activate s 
myogenic pathways and could be a trigger for spi[INVESTIGATOR_615228].  These outcomes 
would justify and inform a larger diaphragm pacing trial and identify candidate mechanisms 
underlying restoration of function.       
It is possible (and perhaps l ikely) that some individuals will demonstrate gains in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615229]. This outcome may be associated with variations in SCI lesion 
characteristics and spared spi[INVESTIGATOR_615230]. This result 
would afford the chance to begin looking for determinant factors associated with ‘responders’ to 
diaphragm pacing and ‘non -responders’, i.e. individuals who benefit from pacing by [CONTACT_615274], but who do not demonstrate gains in resp iratory function or 
diaphragm activation.  Some individuals also may exhibit changes in neuromuscular activation, 
but no apparent gains in respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806].  This outcome also could suggest that changes in 
neuromuscular activation occur before an overt  change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615231].   
Participant compensation  To compensate participants for their time and involvement in the 
assessment pro cedures, study participants will be paid fifty ($50.00) for each assessment. 
Payments will be made throu gh the U of [LOCATION_012] Human Subject Payment system using 
payment cards.  Since up to 8 assessments may be conducted  (7 EMG/respi[INVESTIGATOR_615232]/motor exam) , each participant may receive up to $ 400.00 for completion 
of study procedures.  
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
There is a low risk of harm associated with the assessments in this protocol .  All procedures will 
be closely monitored and fully explained to the participants (using lay -language,  understandable 
terms) so that they understand what to expect and the reasoning for the procedures.  They will be 
informed that they may refuse testing or discontinue study participation at any time.  For 
participants who have difficulty or who are unable to communicate verbally , a communica tion 
system will be implemented.  For instance, the study team will monitor facial expressions and use 
eye blinking by [CONTACT_615275]/no or signal discomfort.  Participants  may be at risk 
for autonomic dy sreflexia , although the incidence is low in patients with acute injuries .  
Participants will be informed to alert the study team if they notice symptoms consistent with 
autonomic dysreflexia (head ache, sweating above the lesion, elevated blood pressure).  The 
study team will closely monitor the participants and is trained to assess and respond to signs of 
dysreflexia.  All procedures will occur in the ICU setting with the participant’s medical team 
immediately available.  
The clinical ASIA snesory and moto r examination of neurologic function is part of standard clinical 
assessments after SCI and is non -invasive.  There is no specific risk of this assessment which 
includes standard tests of sensation and motor function (strength).  Participants may feel 
frustrated or uncomfortable with the testing because they are unable to feel sensations and move 
their limbs as they did prior to SCI.  This may upset some individuals.  It may be uncomfortable for 
some participants to undergo testing in the peri -anal region.  This testing is part of the standard 
care after SCI.  Some participants may feel pain or uncomfortabl e sensations during the testing .  
The procedures will be adjusted to be as comfortable as possible  and the participant s will be 
closely monitored.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] :  2/3/[ADDRESS_815899] clinical care after SCI and in individuals 
with respi[INVESTIGATOR_615233].  These assessments may cause anxiety and may challenge an 
individual’s breathing and cause participants to feel out of breath.  These discomforts will b e 
explained .  Participants will be closely monitored  as previously described .  At any time the 
assessments may be discontinued and breathing support provided as indicated (i.e. re -connect to 
the ventilator ) or turn back on the diaphragm stimulator  or supplemental oxygen support . 
Recording of diaphragm EMGs from the external pacing wires is not part of clinical care.  This 
procedure does not pose direct risk  or likelihood of harm .  It is a non -invasive procedure since the 
pacing wires are already implanted  and externalized .  The participant may feel breathless or 
uncomfortable with the device turned off.  Some participants may feel nervous about turning the 
pacer off.  However, as previously described, this is part of standard  procedures during regular 
battery changes and cleaning of the connectors.  Our team is experienced in working with patients 
and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_615234] ‘OK’ and safe with the pacer turned off.  The participant will be closely 
monitored and supplemental respi[INVESTIGATOR_615235].  At any time the 
assessments may be discontinued and breathing support provided as indicated (i.e. re -connect to 
the ventilator or turn back on the diaphragm stimulator or supplemental oxygen support ).    
8. Possible Benefits:  
There is no direct benefit to participants enrolled in this study.  This study will involve assessments 
to determine the effects of diaphragm pacing  in adults with C -SCIs .  The implementation of this 
intervention  (diaphragm pacing) will not be al tered by [CONTACT_15365].  Our goal is to monitor and study 
the effects of this intervention after short duration, carefully  controlled  session s of stimulation .  The 
outcomes from this study may benefit future individuals with C -SCIs or other clinical populations 
with respi[INVESTIGATOR_615233].   
The risks associated with this study are reasonable because overall the risks are minimal and 
there is potential benefit  to future individuals with C -SCIs , which is a severe catastrophic 
condition .  This study  is an essential step in determining the efficacy of intramuscular diaphragm 
stimulation and its effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_615236].  Outcomes from this study m ay alter 
and/or improve respi[INVESTIGATOR_615237] -C-SCI.  Currently, respi[INVESTIGATOR_615238].   Advancements in respi[INVESTIGATOR_615239] -term 
management are needed to improve outcomes post -SCI and improve health and quality of life 
after SCI.

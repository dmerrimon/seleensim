Study Design and Duration A single-arm prospective study of 30 recruited subjects suffering from sinus pain. All subjects will use the ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief device, a device that uses microcurrent to stimulate nerve fibers passing from the sinus passages through various foramina to the facial skin.  Subjects will read manufacturer’s provided Instructions-For-Use (IFU’s) and proceed to self-perform the treatment. Subjects will report on sinus symptoms before and after the first treatment.   Subjects will also take the device home and use the device daily for four weeks.  Self-report questionnaires for pain, congestion, and medication use will be completed weekly throughout the study. Target Subject Population [ADDRESS_661645] Inclusion Criteria • 18-71 years of age (inclusive) • Present with symptoms of sinus pain or facial pain in the forehead, periorbital, facial, or nasal region • Current pain score ≥ 5 (Numeric Rating Scale 0-10) • Frequency of sinus/facial pain at least twice weekly for 1 month • Able to read and understand English • Agree to participate in the study • Able and willing to provide Informed Consent Subject Exclusion Criteria • Do not meet Inclusion Criteria

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Inflammation of the sinuses and nasal mucosa results in symptoms such as thick nasal mucus, tissue swelling, nasal congestion or obstruction, and pain and pressure in the face[1, 2]. Patients with sinus pain typi[INVESTIGATOR_511622][3]. Sinonasal inflammation can be caused by [CONTACT_80601], allergies, air pollution, or structural problems in the nasal passages. Sinonasal inflammation is a common condition that affects all age groups and women are often more affected than men. Tivic Health Systems Inc. (the Sponsor) intends to introduce a new Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (TENS) device named ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief. The device relieves sinus pain by [CONTACT_511624]-amp electrical stimulation to facial nerves around the sinuses. i.e., the regions around the nose and the supraorbital region of the eye.

Description of the ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief Device ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief (Active Device) ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief is a handheld micro-current TENS device used for the temporary relief of sinus pain.  The device uses an average current that is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of previously cleared TENS devices used in the facial area. The design of ClearUP Sinus Pain Relief was optimized to provide transcutaneous nerve stimulation to the regional areas associated with the sinuses. The pear-shaped device is held in the hand, with the rounded tip of the device applied to the facial skin in the region of the sinus passages. The tip is the active electrode of a monopolar design. The housing of the device serves as the return electrode. The hand holding the device completes the electrical path.  When the user turns the device on and presses the tip to the skin, the device lights up and initiates a low-frequency, pulsed AC circuit that is maintained at a constant current. The device uses the current to calculate the impedance in the path between the tissue at the tip and the hand in contact [INVESTIGATOR_352359].

 Confidential                                        Page 5 of 14   If the calculated impedance is above an impedance threshold, the device is in “Detection” mode. Conversely, when the impedance falls below the impedance threshold, the device enters a “Treatment” mode. The impedance threshold is calculated dynamically by [CONTACT_511625]. The user is instructed to glide the tip of the device along the skin along the cheek, nose and under brow bone. When a low-impedance point is detected, the device signals the user via a slight haptic (vibration) feedback. The user is instructed to hold the device in place until the Treatment period has passed as indicated by [CONTACT_474875] (approximately 7 seconds). Once the Treatment period ends, the device resets to Detection mode. The user is instructed to glide the device along an indicated path until reaching the next low-impedance area. The user may adjust the current setting of the device (low, medium, high) if they prefer more or less current intensity. The default setting for the device is low. 3. INDICATIONS FOR USE  The ClearUPTM Sinus Pain Relief device is to be used for the temporary relief of sinus pain.  4. STUDY OBJECTIVES To assess the feasibility of at-home use of ClearUP and collect data on the longitudinal safety and efficacy of ClearUP as a treatment for pain and congestion.  5. STUDY DESIGN This single-arm (N=30) open label study will be carried out at the Allergy and Asthma Associates of Santa Clara Valley Research Center (San Jose, CA) in collaboration with principle investigator [CONTACT_511635]. Study subjects will be recruited from [CONTACT_511636]’s allergy practice and from the surrounding community. Eligible subjects will complete informed consent and be enrolled into the study.  Validated questionnaires will be used to quantify sinonasal symptoms including pain (numeric rating scale) and congestion (Congestion Quantifier 7), medication use, and user experience. Subjects will use the ClearUP device for five minutes during the study visit and then take the device home with them with instructions to use the device once daily and up to four times daily as needed, with each treatment lasting five minutes. Acute pain relief data will be collected after the first treatment (0-6 hours) and data on pain, congestion, and medication use will be collected weekly for four weeks. To facilitate a real-world pragmatic trial, subjects will be allowed to use medication during the study. Study visits will take place at enrollment and at 4 weeks.

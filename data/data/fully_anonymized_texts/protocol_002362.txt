1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
This is an NCI funded ( U01CA157442 -01A1 ) study to assess the prognostic value of fluorine -18- 
labeled  fluoro -misonidazole  (18F-FMISO), a hypoxia radiotracer, in patients with non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) who are treated with definitive conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (RT), 
neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  or chemo -RT. The secondar y goal will be to assess  the predictive  value  of 18F- 
FDG, a metabolic rate radiotracer, in a second group.  Please note that all patients entered on this 
protocol will undergo the standard of care treatment for NSCLC.  The information  obtained from the 
use of investigational 18F-FDG and 18F-FMISO PET scans will NOT be used to manage patients’ 
treatment on this protocol.  
Schema:  
There  are two groups currently  active  in this protocol. Group  [ADDRESS_861530] completed a routine pre -treatment FB and breath -hold 18F-FDG PET/CT and pre - 
treatment 18F-FMISO PET Scan.  
• Group 1: Perform a routine pre -treatment free -breathing (FB) and breath -hold (for only one PET 
Field of View, i.e. an additional ~10 min of PET/CT imaging) 18F-FDG PET/CT. If the patient is 
planned to receive radiotherapy, the FB PET/CT scan will be used for RT planning.  
• Group 2: Perform a routine pre -treatment free -breathing (FB)  18F-FDG PET/CT. If the patient is 
planned to receive radiotherapy, the FB PET/CT scan will be used to RT planning.  
• Both  groups  with perform  a pre-treatment  dynamic  18F-FMISO  PET scan (18F-FMISO1).  This scan 
will occur  at least one day after the baseline  18F-FDG  PET/CT  scan,  but prior  to initiation  of therapy. 
A baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT  scan may be acceptable provided it is not  earlier than one month 
prior  to the 18F-FMISO  study  and will assist  to define  the field of view  of the dynamic 18F-FMISO 
PET scan.  If a CT is available  to allow  definition  of the tumor  region,  then the 18F-FMISO  may be 
performed before the FDG PET scan. Dynamic 18F-FMISO PET images will be corrected for 
breathing -induced  artifacts  allowing  kinet ic analysis  to be performed  for both the motion -corrected 
and the free -breathing dynamic PET image sets. The degree of hypoxia within the tumor volume 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_643866] 18F-FMISO irreversible trappi[INVESTIGATOR_643843].  
• Group 1 : 18F -FMISO2/FDG mid -treatment PET/CT : Perform a mid-treatment dynamic 18F- 
FMISO (FMISO2) PET/CT (following the same protocol as for the baseline FMISO) scan in a 
group of twenty five patients, undergoing RT or concurrent chemo -RT. This scan will occur two 
weeks +/ - 4 days after the start of radiotherap y or the radiation portion of combined chemo - 
radiation (Diagram 1).  
 
• Perform  a mid-treatment  18F-FDG  PET/CT  scan in a group  of twenty  five patients,  undergoing  RT 
or concurrent  chemo -RT. This scan will occur  two to three  weeks  +/- 4 days after start of treatment 
of radiotherapy  or the radiation  portion  of combined  chemo -radiation.18F-FDG  PET/CT  scans  will 
be performed in both Free -Breathing (FB) and Breath -Hold (BH) modes. The predictive value of 
18F-FDG,  based  on the change  in lesion  SUVpeak  between  baseline  and the 3-week  mid-treatment  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center 
IRB Number: 13 -186 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_861531] criteria, will be assessed using both the FB, and the BH, image 
sets independently.  Results  deduced  from  the FB and BH data sets will be compared  and correlated 
with outcome.  
• Group  2: Combined  18F-FMISO/18F -FDG  baseline  PET/CT:  In a group  of 5 patients,  two PET 
radiotracers 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG will be injected sequentially into the patient. Since all PET 
radiotracers emit the same 511 keV coincidence photons, it is not possible to discriminate events 
from  these  different  radiotracers.  However,  by [CONTACT_14664]  a dynamic  PET/CT  scan with staggered 
18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG injections (45min +/ - 15min apart), the kinetic profiles should provide 
sufficient information to allow signals from the two radiotracers to be clearly separated.  This 
sequential 18F-FMISO / 18F-FDG study will be performed at least one day after the sole FMISO1 
radiotracer baseline PET/CT scan, and prior to the initiation of therapy. The 18F-FMISO and 18F- 
FDG individual signals will be deduced from the combined dynamic PET images by [CONTACT_643867], and the corresponding radiotracers entrap ments within the tumor will be 
determined.  The accuracy  of the 18F-FMISO  signal  extraction  from the combined  one in the staggered 
18F-FMISO/18F-FDG  dynamic  PET/CT  study  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_643868]1 study (Diagram 2).

2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND  SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
The primary  objectives  of this study  are: 
• To correlate  the presence  and extent  of hypoxia,  as defined  by 18F-FMISO  FB and BH PET/CT 
at baseline with 3 -year progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  
 
• To assess the predictive value of 18F-FMISO PET/CT in lung cancer patients undergoing  
radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy, as measured by [CONTACT_643869] -Hold (BH) and Free - 
Breathing (FB) PET/CT images, and to determine whether BH PET/CT provides greater 
predictive capability than Free -Breathing (FB) PET/CT.  
The secondary  objective  of this  study  is: 
 
• To assess the predictive value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in a group of twenty five lung cancer 
patients undergoing radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy, as measured by [CONTACT_643869] - 
Hold (BH) and Free -Breathing (FB) PET/CT images, an d to determine whether BH PET/CT 
provides greater predictive capability than Free -Breathing (FB) PET/CT.

 • To assess the feasibility of simultaneous 18F-FDG and 18F-FMISO PET dynamic acquisitions 
in a group of 5 patients undergoing radiotherapy  or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. If 
successful, our approach would allow multi -radiotracer PET exams on the same day reducing 
the need  for extra  patient  visits.  For the patients  who will undergo  the dual FMISO/FDG  study, 
the mid -treatment FMISO will be op tional.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
3.1 18F-FDG  PET/CT  
 
18F-FDG  PET is a non-invasive  molecular  imaging  tool that has been  shown  to have  a major  impact  on 
the diagnosis  and staging  of NSCLC,  as well as in treatment  planning  of radiotherapy  and detection  of 
recurrent disease ( 1-4). Its prognostic and predictive values in NSCLC have been well demonstrated 
(5) 
 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_643844] 15 patients, a reduction in 18F-FDG uptake of more than 50% between 
pre- and post - induction chemotherapy in the primary tumor or mediastinal clearance was shown to  
be a better predictor of long -term survival ( 6) compared with the standard WHO criteria used for 
response assessment on CT. In another multi -center study that evaluated 18F-FDG -PET before and 
after [ADDRESS_861532] prognostic factor ( 7). Its predictive value with 
respect to therapy outcome of combined chemo -radio therapy has also been demonstrated ( 8-10). 
Currently, no early markers of tumor response to radiation therapy are in existence or in clinical use. 
While FDG -PET has become a standard modali ty for staging and re -staging of NSCLC, its value as 
an early  response  marker  during  radiation  therapy  remains  unclear.  The University  of Michigan  tested 
the value of a mid -treatment FDG -PET scan at 45 Gy in 15 patients ( 11). The qualitative response 
during RT correlated with the overall response post -RT. However, the later during the t reatment 
course  the PET scan is performed, the  lesser are  the chances  of making  adjustments  to the initial  first- 
line treatment, as the majority of the RT dose is already delivered at 45 Gy. Therefore, we are 
planning  to perform the FDG -PET scan at an ear lier time  point of 3  weeks at a dose  of approximately 
30 Gy. This will provide the basis for early tumor assessment and adaptive radiation therapy 
strategies that would take into account an early tumor response. It would allow stratification of 
patients in to favorable and unfavorable responders and the development of individually tailored 
strategies for these patients.  
 
Consequently,  18F-FDG -PET can form  the basis  for clinical  trials  evaluating  the feasibility  of adopting 
therapy based on response assessment ( 12-15). 
Due to patient breathing, FDG PET quantitation may become susceptible to breathing -induced 
uncertainties, which may reduce the prognosti c and predictive values of FDG -PET. Breath -Hold 
PET/CT acquisition has been shown to improve the accuracy of PET quantitation. In contrast to the 
study  by [CONTACT_643870]. (11), we will therefore  measure  the prognostic  and predictive  values  of FDG  PET 
using  BH PET data,  and compare  those  with results deduced from the  free-breathing  data sets. Due  to 
the improved accuracy  of BH -PET quantitation, we expect BH data would yield improved prognostic 
values over those of the FB PET.

 3.2 Hypoxia  
 
Hypoxia  is a characteristic  feature  of malignant  tumors  that has been  well established  (16-22) . Unlike 
healthy  tissues,  tumors  often  grow  at a rate that outgrows  their blood  supply  resulting  in the emergence  of 
regions  of hypoxia. Immunohistochemical  studies have shown nests of hypoxic cells of up to several 
hundred micrometers in diameter, located at poorly perfused locations within the tumor ( 23-25). 
Hypoxia can create selective pressur es that render the tumor more aggressive and radioresistant, and 
has been  shown  to exhibit  an increased  likelihood  of locoregional  recurrence,  propensity  for metastasis, 
and poor overall outcome. With invasive measurements, a hypoxia fraction HF2.5 (percen tage of 
measurements <2.5 mmHg) was shown to be the most predictive factor for survival in head & neck 
cancer (HNC), with a threshold HF2.5 of 20% [17]. In NSCLC, 62% of patients exhibited a HF2.5 < 
20% ( 26). 
 
Locoregional control in non -surgically treated NSCLC patients continues to be a major challenge. 
Locally -advanced NSCLC patients currently experience freedom from local progression at 3 years 
(FFLP,  defined  as intrathoracic  tumor  progres sion by [CONTACT_643871])  of only 38% 
and locoregional control (LRC, a stricter definition that requires at least a partial response prior to 
progression) of 14%, with a 5 -year overall survival of approximately 20%, as it was recently 
demonstrated in a comprehensive review of seven RTOG trials ( 27). This may at least in part be due 
to the often large tumor size and significant hypoxia levels in these tumors. PET is a noninvasive 
imaging  modality  with the potential to identify  tumor hypoxia at both global and local  levels through 
the use of hypoxia targeting molecules.  If these hypoxic regions are identified, this will lay the 
foundation for future studies targeting these hypoxic sub -regions and/or altering treatment regimen, 
with the ultimate  goal to improve  the treatment  outcome  of patients  with NSCLC.  We and others  have 
previously  shown  that dose escalation can be  successfully  given  to patients with  stage III  NSCLC  to a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 84 Gy ( 28). This resulted in a promising 2 -year local control rate 
of 52%. RTOG 0117, a phase I/II dose escalation study in patients treated with concurrent 
chemoradiation, found the MTD to be 74 Gy ( 29). A pooled analysis of seven RTOG studies of 
chemoradiation  for locally  advanced  NSCLC  found  that a 1-Gy increase  in biologically  effective  dose 
resulted in an approximately 4% relative improvement in survival and a 3% relative improvement in 
locoregional  control  (30). Currently,  the standard  dose for concurrent  chemoradiation  therapy is 60 Gy. 
While a recent phase III study  (RTOG 0617) appeared to be unsuccessful when escalating  the dose to 
the entire tumor volume to 74 Gy  (31), it remains unknown whether escalating the dose to 
radioresistant tumor subvolumes would not result in better tumor control. Therefore, identifying such 
subvolumes may provide the basis to a more intelligent dose escalation approach in order to improve 
the dismal outcomes in stage III NSCLC.  
 
3.3 18F-FMISO  PET  Scan  and Tumor  Hypoxia  
 
Positron emission tomography with 18F-Fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO PET) is a non -invasive 
imaging  technique  that was shown  to be clinically  feasible  for detecting  tumor  hypoxia  in NSCLC  (32, 
33). Patients will be given the option to participate in a research study that aims to investigate the 
prevalence  of hypoxia  (as determined  by 18F-FMISO  PET)  in this patient  population,  and to assess  the 
reproducibility  and prognostic  value  of 18F-FMISO  dynamic  PET (dynPET)  images  in NSCLC  patients 
prior  to standard  treatment  for their lung cancer.  Tumor  hypoxia  is an independent  predictor  of poor

in NSCLC,  because  it is relatively  common  in lung cancer,  and because  the outcome  for hypoxic  tumors 
may potentially  be improved  with more  aggressive  chemotherapy  or radiotherapy,  or hypoxia -directed 
treatments such as the administration of hypoxia activated prodrugs ( 34, 35) or carbogen breathing 
(95%  oxygen,  5% carbon  dioxide)  (36). 18F-FMISO  PET has been  shown to correlate  with hypoxia  and 
treatment outcome in NSCLC ( 32, 37). Previous study  used either qualitative analysis of the d ynamic 
FMISO time activity  curves ( 38) or quantitative analysis of late static FMISO images ( 37) to identify 
hypoxia.  
The optimal method to quantitate hypoxia using 18F-FMISO is to perform compa rtmental analysis of 
the dynPET images  (39-41). This is a method which uses  kinetic information from dynamic scans to 
assess the rate of uptake and entrapment within the hypoxic tumor tissue. However, compartmental 
analysis is not meaningful on standard clinical PET images of the lung because of respi[INVESTIGATOR_643845]. Our group at MSKCC has developed a technique for Breath -Hold (BH) 
PET/CT  imaging.  During  BH PET/CT,  patients are asked  to hold the breath  for as long as possible,  and 
data are acquired only during  the time of the BH, using an in -house respi[INVESTIGATOR_643846] ( 42). PET emission data will be acquired only while the patient is 
holding  the breath  as monitored  by [CONTACT_643872]. This  process will  be repeated 
until a total of 3 min of BH PET data (equivalent to clinical setup) are acquired. We now propose a 
novel technique to acquire motion -free 18F-FMISO dynPET images of lung  (one 15 cm field of view) 
to make accurate compartment analysis, and thus qu antification of tissue hypoxia, possible. We shall 
acquire clinical 18F-FMISO dynPET images in Free -Breathing (FB) with the list mode (LM) option. 
During  the dynamic  PET study,  the patient’s  breathing  signal  will be recorded  simultaneously  using  an 
in-hous e developed tracking software assisted by a video camera. The camera is used to monitor the 
motion  of fiducial  markers  positioned  on the patient’s  abdomen.  The patient’s  breathing  signal  will be 
correlated to the PET data on an event -by-event basis and then only those corresponding to end - 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_643847],  thus resulting  in motion -free images.  Incorporating 
all the PET events from the same dynamic PET study results in the FB dynamic PET data set.  
In PET/CT,  CT images  are used to correct  for attenuation  in the PET images.  Spatial  matching  between 
PET and CT images is therefore crucial. Therefore, CT images at breathing phases matching those of 
the PET images w ill be acquired. PET data will be corrected for attenuation using the phase -matched 
CT images.  
The value of 18F-FMISO -PET as an early response marker during radiation therapy is still unknown. 
In a study  in 20 patients  with head  and neck  cancer  who underwent  baseline  and mid-treatment  FMISO 
imaging,  90% of patients  showed  complete  resolution  of 18F-FMISO  uptake  in the mid-treatment  scan, 
suggesting  tumor re -oxygenation ( 43). In the curre nt study, we will assess the predictive value of 18F- 
FMISO at 2 weeks +/[ADDRESS_861534] -initiation of therapy (~ at a dose of 20Gy). This will allow 
identification of persistent radioresistant tumor sub -volumes. These data may provide the basis for 
future res ponse adaptive radiation therapy strategies. For instance, patients with persistent hypoxia, if 
prognostic of poor outcome, may  in a future studies be selected for a site directed additional radiation 
boost.  
 
In this protocol, both 18F-FMISO and mid -treatm ent 18F-FDG imaging shall be used for exploratory 
research  purposes  only;  the image  findings  and results  will not be used to change  patient  management. 
MSKCC  holds  an IND for the use of 18F-FMISO  under  IRB protocol  #04-070 (P.I. [CONTACT_643891]).

 This protocol  shall  use 18F-FMISO  under  cross -file with IND 115764,  since  the radiolabeling  chemistry 
and dosage shall be identical to protocol IRB #04 -070. 
 
 
3.4 Simultaneous  imaging  of tumor  hypoxia  and tumor metabolism  
Imaging hypoxia and metabolism simultaneously may provide a new understanding of the role of the 
tumor  microenvironment;  in particular  the interplay  between  hypoxia  (defined  by 18FMISO)  and tumor 
cell metabolism (defined by 18FDG).  
18F-FMISO and 18FDG have  been shown to be important prognostic and predictive biomarkers in 
patients undergoing CRT [59, 60]. Identifying simultaneously hypoxic and metabolically active sub - 
regions within the tumor is a more coherent measurement of the tumor microenvironments th an co - 
registering images acquired in different imaging sessions where temporal changes in the biology and 
inaccuracies in the image registration curtail the integrity of the data. Previous studies have 
demonstrated both the feasibility and potential for simultaneous assessment of two physiological 
processes (mainly in brain) by [CONTACT_643873] [61] kinetic, or daughter outputs (positron vs 
positron+cascade ) (44) differenc es between radiotracers.  
In this protocol, we are going to apply a new method to obtain the information from two F -18 based 
PET radiotracers (18F-FMISO and 18FDG) in a single PET/CT acquisition. We have developed a 
preliminary means of decoupling the indiv idual signals with the ultimate goal to use the combined 
hypoxia/metabolic  rate map to guide  and adapt  CRT,  and monitor  response  in a larger  cohort  of patients 
with NSCLC and other malignancies. In preliminary studies, we have successfully established 
meth odology and validated that in both mathematical simulations and animal models, for achieving 
this objective, and propose  to apply  this methodology  to patients receiving sequential 18F-FMISO  and 
FDG  dynamic  PET exams  in this study.  We propose  to conduct  compartmental  analysis  from  a single 
dynamic 18FMISO and 18FDG PET acquisition in which 18FMISO is injected concurrently with the 
start of the dynamic  PET acquisition,  followed  by [CONTACT_643874] 18FDG  about  45 min +/- 15 min later. 
We hypothesize that simultaneous 18FMISO and 18FDG PET imaging will result in prognostic and 
predictive values that are superior to those achieved when imaging is performed separately for each 
radiotracer (i.e. in 2 scanning sessions, days apart). We believe this enhancement will be due to (1) 
exact co -localization of the 2 markers (no co -registration necessary), and (2) absence of inter -scan 
transient  biologic  changes.  We believe  this method  will lay the foundation  for future  studies  using  dual 
PET radiotrace rs in patients  with NSCLC  and other  malignancies,  and may have  potential  implications 
for dose painting strategies in radiotherapy, adaptive CRT, and assessing response to treatment. If 
clinically feasible, comparison of the prognostic and predictive value s of combined 18F-FMISO/18F- 
FDG  with those  of each of the two radiotracers  (when  imaged  separately)  shall  be the subject  of a future 
investigation in a larger cohort of lung patients.  
 
 
3.5 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_643848]/CT  imaging  of the  thorax  
Patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_643849]/CT imaging results in artifacts in the PET/CT images due to 
internal organ motion. In CT images, breathing -induced artifacts are mainly due to the dynamic 
interaction between transaxial image acquisition and the asyn chronous motion of tumor and normal 
tissue ( 45). Commonly observed artifacts include distortion of the dome of the liver at the lung - 
diaphragm interface, splitting of a tumor into multiple d istinct parts, out -of-order shuffling of the 
transaxial  slices,  and creation  of discontinuities  in the diaphragm/lung  interface  (45). In PET,  due to 
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

Page  11 of 36  
 the long acquisition  time per bed position  (3 to 7 min),  PET images  are then time-averaged  over many 
breathing cycles (average breathing period is 5 seconds). This results in the blurring o f the target 
volume ( 42, 46, 47), and reduces the apparent radiotracer uptake ( 46, 48). 
 
In hybrid PET/CT, respi[INVESTIGATOR_643850], primarily due to the 
temporal mis -match between PET images and the corresponding CT -based attenuation map. A 
common artifact due to the tempo -spatial mis -match between PET and CT is the mis -localization of 
lesions  at the border  of two organs  (42, 49). The tempo -spatial  mismatch  between  PET and CT images 
can also result  in an increased  uncertainty  in the apparent  tumor  SUV  due to the  use of a non-spatially 
matching CT image set to correct for attenuation in the PET images. Erdi and co -workers showed 
dependence  of the measured  tumor  SUV  on the breathing  phase  at which  CT images  were  acquired at. 
 
3.6 Correction  for Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y Motion  Artifacts:  Deep -Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] -Breath -Hold  (DIBH) 
PET/CT  
 
We have  recently  developed  a novel  technique  to correct  for breathing  artifacts  in PET/CT  images,  the 
Deep -Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] -Breath -Hold (DIBH) acquisition( 42). We believe DIBH is the most pragmatic and 
robust approach to eliminate misregistration of PET and CT data. In this approach, the patie nt is 
instructed  to hold the breath  during  CT acquisition.  The amplitude  at which  the hold (HA)  period  occurs 
is identified  using  a respi[INVESTIGATOR_643851].  During  PET acquisition,  the patient  is then instructed 
to hold the breath  at the same  (HA),  over subsequent  periods.  PET data will be acquired  only while  the 
patient is holding the breath as monitored by [CONTACT_643875]. This will repeated 
till a total of 3min of BH PET data are acquired. Finally, PET data corresponding to the hold periods 
are summed into one data set, and then reconstructed using the corresponding breath -hold CT image 
set. With DIBH PET/CT (as compared to nonrespi[INVESTIGATOR_64947] -corrected PET/CT) we observed as 
much  as an 83% increase  in lesion  SUV,  and as much  as 50% improvement  in spatial  matching  between 
PET and CT(42). DIBH  PET/CT  had the advantage  of reducing  misregistration,  as both the CT and the 
PET components were acquired in the same respi[INVESTIGATOR_62398]. This was particularly useful for 
distinguishing between pulmonary and extrapulmonary lesions in the chest wall or mediastinum. 
Additionally, a small nodule that was not seen on clinical PET/CT  showed mild  18F-FDG uptake on 
BH PET/CT; this was an additional site of metastasis in a patient with lymphangitic spread. DIBH - 
PET also results in an improved signal -to-noise ratio, which can yield increasing lesion detectability. 
In CT, DIBH imaging als o resulted in detection of 2.2 additional nodules on average per patient, 
especially when those nodules were smaller than 0.5 cm( 50). DIBH CT also allowed more precise 
localization and charact erization of pulmonary lesions than non -DIBH CT( 42, 50). 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
This is a single -institu tion exploratory  study  evaluating  the prognostic  and predictive  significance  and 
reproducibility  of tumor hypoxia as imaged by 18F-FMISO PET, in NSCLC patients before receiving 
any treatments  for their disease.  In a sub-group  of these  patients,  we will assess  the predictive  value  of 
18F-FDG PET/CT as well. Moreover, in a sub -group of five patients, we will assess the feasibility of 
simultaneous 18F-FMISO/18F-FDG acquisitions. Patients will be identified in thoracic oncology, 
radiation  oncology,  or radiol ogy departments  at the time of their planned  diagnostic  imaging  studies.

 We will also evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of 18F-FMISO during the imaging studies. 
Moreover, we will evaluate the significance of breath hold (BH) imaging ove r standard techniques in 
both18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FMISO PET/CT image sets in patients from Group 1, as outlined in 
Sections  9.1 and 9.2. Patients  will be identified  and consented  prior  to their baseline  18F-FDG -PET/CT. 
A total of 25 patients  will be accrued  for this study  over a 3 year period; 10  patients  who are receiving 
RT or concurrent  chemo  RT and 16 patients  who are  receiving  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy. The  group 
of 10 patients  receiving  RT or concurrent  chemo -RT will receive  an additional  repeat  18F-FDG  PET/CT 
scan at mid -treatment.

7.0 Recruitment  Plan  with  limited  waiver  of authorization  
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  team,  the protocol 
investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer center (MSKCC).  If the 
investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their patient’s medical records for 
suitable  research  study  participants  and discuss  the study and their potential  for enrolling  in the research 
study. Potential subjects contact[CONTACT_643876]/research staff of the study.  
The principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_643852] s with whom  they do not have 
a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying patients  who would  be eligible  to enroll 
in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  [CONTACT_643877].  
Patients who are receiving chemotherapy only will be identified when they are referred to Nuclear 
Medicine for their standard FDG PET scans. Patients receiving combined chemoradiotherapy will be 
identifi ed by [CONTACT_643878].  
During  the initial  conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and the patient,  the patient  may 
be asked to provide certain health information that i s necessary to the recruitment and enrollment 
process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical  records  at MSKCC 
in order to further assess eligibility.  They will use the information provided by [CONTACT_5363]/or 
medical record to confirm that the patient is eligible and to contact [CONTACT_643879].  If the patient  turns  out to be ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will destroy 
all information collected on the patient during the initial conversation and medical records review, 
except for any information that must be maintained for screening log purposes.  
In most  cases,  the initial  contact  [CONTACT_643880], investigator or the research staff working in consultation with the treatment team.  The 
recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients  who are 
screened and minimal PHI  will be  maintained as part  of a screening  log. For these  reasons, we  seek a 
(partial) limited waiver of authorization for the purposes of (1) reviewing medical records to identify 
potential research subjects and obtain informat ion relevant to the enrollment process; (2) conversing 
with patients regarding possible enrollment; (3) handling of PHI contained within those records and 
provided by [CONTACT_41907]; and (4) maintaining information in a screening log of patients 
approached.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
Patients  will be monitored  by a member  of the nuclear  medicine  staff before,  during  and through 
the completion of their imaging studies.  
9.1 18F-FDG  PET/CT:  
In patients who have consented to this study prior to their baseline 18F-FDG PET scan, 4D -CT (10 
mA)/free breathing PET and breath hold CT(10 mA)/PET images will be acquired over one field -of- 
view encompassing  the lesion in the 18F-FDG PET/CT scan in order to assess the improvement in the 
prognostic value of 18F-FDG -PET/CT i n lung cancer due to correction of breathing -induced artifacts 
in the PET/CT images. The PET/CT acquisition will be assisted by  [CONTACT_28920] -house developed respi[INVESTIGATOR_643853], and then correct for 
breathing –induced  artifacts  in the PET/CT  images.  The patient  breathing  during  all phases  of the study 
will be monitored and recorded by [CONTACT_77637][INVESTIGATOR_643854]. Such respi[INVESTIGATOR_643855].  The 
baseline  and follow -up 18F-FDG  PET/CT  scans  for each individual  patient  should  be performed  on the 
same PET/CT scanner for consistency  purpose. For patients receiving radiation therapy  or concu rrent 
chemo -RT, this research procedure will immediately follow the standard radiotherapy 18F-FDG 
PET/CT  simulation  protocol,  with the patient  in treatment  position.  This group  will also receive  a mid- 
treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT scan which will occur three weeks +/ - 4 days after start of treatment of 
radiotherapy or the radiation portion of combined chemo -radiation. This mid -treatment 18F-FDG 
PET/CT is investigational. Only patients in Group 1 will participate in BH s cans.  
All research scans will be performed by [CONTACT_643881]. For patients receiving radiation, 
all 18F-FDG  PET/CT  scans  will be performed  on the GE PET/CT  scanner  residing  in the radiotherapy 
simulation  suite.  Otherwise,  those  scans  will be performed  on one of the GE PET/CT  scanners  residing 
in nuclear medicine.

 9.2 18F-FMISO  PET/CT  Scan  Protocol:  
The first 18F-FMISO  PET/CT  scan will be performed  within  14 days (+/- 5 days)  after the baseline  18F- 
FDG  scan,  and before  starting  therapy.  Dynamic  FMISO  PET scans  will be performed  on one of the GE 
Discovery  PET/CT  scanners  residing  in the nuclear  medicine  department  at MSKCC.  The patient  will be 
set up in treatment position with intra -venous lines for radiotracer injection and for venous blood 
sampling. One 370 MBq (10 mCi) +/ - 10% dose of 18F-FMISO will be injected as a bolus, and the 
dynamic scan initiated coincident with the injection.  
Dynamic 18F-FMISO PET data will be acquired in List Mode and reconstructed in time frames that 
display the kinetics of tumor uptake. The total duration of the study is approximately [ADDRESS_861541] PET scan segments. In all three sessions of the dynamic PET study, the 
patient’s breathing signal will be recorded simultaneously using the in -house developed tracking 
described previously. The respi[INVESTIGATOR_643856] -expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Those events will be selected retrospectively to generate a dynamic 
PET data set corresponding to end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (BH -dyn PET), motion -free PET images.  
In each of the three dynamic sessions, a 4D -CT (10mA) scan and a BH -CT (10mA) scan (at end - 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) of a 15cm segment of the body (the field of view of the PET scanner) will be performed 
with the tumor at the field center. These images will be used for both attenuation correction and 
registration  of the serial  image  set, for the free -breathing  and BH  PET dynamic  data sets respectively.  
To further  facilitate  patient  image  registration,  external  fiducial  markers  may be placed  on the patient’s 
thorax.  
A second set of three dynamic 18F-FMISO scans will be performed following the same sequence as 
outlined  above  for the baseline  dynamic  18F-FMISO  study,  at 2 to 3 weeks  (+/- 4 days)  post-initiation 
of therapy.  
To ensure patient safety, vital signs and toxicity assessments will be performed immediately after 
each scan session. Additionally, approximately 24 hours (or on the next business day) after the 
completion  of each scan session,  a toxicity  assessment  will be completed  via a telephone  followup.  
 
Only  patients  in Group  1 will participate  in BH scans.  
 
9.3 Pharmacokinetic  Modeling  of 18F-FMISO  PET:  
The dynamic  data of the 18F-FMISO  radiotracer  in the tumor  must  be supplemented  by [CONTACT_643882].  Blood  samples  may be taken  at pre-designated  times  during  the 18F-FMISO  PET scan. 
If the PET images contain the heart within the field of view, one IV blood sample (about 1 -2 ml) will 
be drawn at [ADDRESS_861542] 18F -FMISO injection.  If the heart is not within the PET FOV,a 
maximum  of 9 IV blood samples  (about  1-2 ml each)  may be obtained at  approximately  the following 
time points: 1, 2, 3,4, 5,  15, 30, [ADDRESS_861543] injection. A separate IV line (other than the 
one used for  FMISO injection) will be used to draw the blood. These samples will be weighed and 
counted for the purpose of determining the blood clearance kinetics and the tumor input function.

1, Compartmental kinetic analysis of the dynamic 18F-FMISO PET images will be conducted using the 
blood clearance time activity curve as input function to the 18F-FMISO compartmental model. The 
kinetic  rate constants  k1, k2, and k3 (trappi[INVESTIGATOR_643857]) will be deduced.  As a first approximation,  hypoxic 
sub-regions within the tumor will be defined based on a k3 > 0.1. We will then re -assess this k3 
threshold based on results from the first [ADDRESS_861544] and second scans.  
 
9.4 Simultaneous  18F-FDG/18F-FMISO  PET/CT  Scan  Protocol:  
Simultaneous  Dynamic  PET 18FMISO/18FDG  scan will be performed  at least one day after the sole 
baseline 18FMISO PET/CT, but preceding chemo - or radiation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Dynamic PET/CT data 
will be acquired over the same single FOV as for the sole baseline 18FMISO PET/CT described 
above. CT images will be acquired for PET attenuation correction purpose. Imaging will start 
simultaneously  with the intravenous  bolus  injection  of 18F-FMISO  (8 mCi +/- 10%).  PET data will 
be acquired in list mode (LM). The dynamic acquisition will last for up to a total of 120 min. 8 
mCi (+/ - 10%) of 18FDG will be injected intravenously 45 min +/ - [ADDRESS_861545] imaging session, an additional 10 min dynamic PET scan may be performed at 
90 min +/ - [ADDRESS_861546] -BH (40mA and [ADDRESS_861547] 
session and the subsequent sessions respectively) will be performe d for attenuation correction,  
 
All PET and CT data will be acquired  and recorded  in a secure  patient  database.  During  all imaging 
sessions, patients will be immobilized in RT alpha cradle if available and tolerable.  
 
9.5 Pharmacokinetic  Modeling  of Simultaneous  18F-FDG/18F-FMISO  PET : 
We will perform compartmental analysis of the combined 18F-FMISO/18F-FDG tumor uptake 
profiles obtained from dynamic PET images. The individual 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG input 
functions  will be derived  from  the drawn  blood  samples  during  the dynamic  PET study,  using  Thin 
Layer  Chromatography  (TLC),  and based  on methodology  we have  previously  developed.  We have 
previously shown the feasibility of this technique to uncouple8F based radiotracers, 18F-FMISO 
and 18F-FLT. We will use the same technique here to uncouple the FMISO/FDG fractions in the 
blood. The tumor combined FMISO/FDG Time Activity Curve (TAC), will be  determined from 
the dynamic PET image set, and then the 18FMISO and 18FDG respective output functions will 
uncoupled  from  the combined  TAC.  Final ly, compartmental  analyis  will be carried  out for the 
FMISO and  FDG respective  output  functions  The kinetic  parameters  V k2, k3, and  k4 (for 
18FDG)  will be calculated  for the FMISO  and FDG  signals  respectively.  The procedure  for carrying 
out compartmental analysis of FMISO and FDG dynamic PET with both radiotracers imaged 
within the same PET imaging session is shown in diagram 3.

11.1.1  18F-FDG  PET  Schedule  
 
18F-FDG is an FDA approved radiotracer. In patients who are receiving radiation and agree to 
participate in this protocol, one additional 18F-FDG PET scan will be obtained mid -treatment 
(as described in section 1.0) to assess response to therapy. This follow  up FDG scan is 
investigational.  Besides,  in the baseline  FDG  PET/CT,  which  is standard  of care,  additional  two 
one PET/CT FOV over the lesion will be acquired following the clinical scan. This additional 
FOV is investigational and will be acquired first i n FB and then in BH (same as for the 
investigational follow up FDG PET/CT study). The CT components will be acquired in cine 
mode and then BH respectively.  
 
Only  patients  in Group  1 will participate  in BH scans.

 12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
There are two primary goals for this study; first, to assess the reproducibility of kinetic analysis of 
dynamic  18F-FMISO  PET images,  in both BH  and FB data sets, and second,  to assess  the prognostic 
value of hypoxia, as measured with 18F-FMISO PET, with O S and PFS in NSCLC. As explained 
above, the presence and extent of tumor hypoxia will be measured by [CONTACT_643884] 18F-FMISO PET images. Kinetic analysis parameters may be susceptible to breathing - 
induced motion artifacts due to pat ient respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. Hence,  the correlation of outcome to both the 
presence and extent of tumor hypoxia may be inaccurate .We will therefore conduct analyses based 
on BH- and FB- PET datasets,  and then compare  the results  in order  to assess  the effect  breathing  on 
these parameters. This exploratory objective of tumor hypoxia correlation to clinical endpoints is 
dependent on time to tumor progression and death. We will follow up with these patients up to a 
maximum of three years. The table below summariz es the milestones of this research project.  
Likewise, the predictive value of FDG  PET may  also be suspect due to breathing  motion artifacts. In 
light of the discussion  above,  therefore,  the secondary  aim is to compare  the predictive  value  of FDG 
PET when the data are acquired in BH versus in FB PET.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
If at any time the patient  develops  unacceptable  toxicity  he/she  will be removed  from  study.  An 
unacceptable toxicity will be defined by a grade III/IV toxicity  requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643859] v4.0  
 
If at any time the patient is found to be ineligible for the protocol as designated in the section on 
Criteria  for Patient/Subject  Eligibility  (i.e., a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be removed  from 
the study.  
 
Patients who are withdrawn from the study before completing all protocol required scans will be 
replaced to ensure there are 25 evaluable patients.  
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
This study  will enroll  25 patients  with non-small  cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  who will undergo  treatment 
with definitive  conventionally  fractionated  radiation  therapy  (RT),  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy,  or chemo -RT. 
In addition  to standard  of care PET/CT  scans,  they will also be scanned  twice  at baseline  (pre-treatment)  with 
experimental 18F-FMISO scans.  
 
Since  some  patients  will have  multiple  lesions  some  of the statistical  analyses  will be lesion -based  and 
some will be patient -based. This is explained in detail within each analysis but primarily, 
reproducibility analyses will be lesion -based and analysis of predictive values will be patient -based. 
Presence and extent of hypoxia will be analyzed twice, on e lesion -based and the other patient -based. 
One of the primary objectives is to evaluate the reproducibility of kinetic analysis in serial, BH and 
Free-Breathing  (FB), dynamic 18F-FMISO PET images. Hypoxia is measured by  k3, the trappi[INVESTIGATOR_643857] 
(see section  7.3). This will be analyzed  both as a binary  and a  continuous  variable:  if any  of the voxels  
Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center

Approval date: 22 -Dec-2023  
Page  27 of 36  
 inside  the tumor  has a k3>0.1  the tumor  is defined  to be hypoxic  while  its extent  will be defined  by [CONTACT_643885] k3>0.1.  Reproducibility  will be 
evaluated  using  Cohen’s  kappa  for presence  of hypoxia  and concordance  correlation  coefficient  for the 
extent of hypoxia. This will be a lesion -based analysis and multiple observations per patien t will be 
taken  into account  using  a variance  inflation  factor  estimated  from  the intraclass  correlation  coefficient.  
 
Another  primary  objective  is to compare  the presence  and extent  of hypoxia  with the clinical  outcome 
(see section 7.3 and above for the definition of hypoxia). Previous studies showed comparable 
outcomes  for stage  IIIA (which  is the majority  treated)  when  following  either  of the two treatment  arms 
considered in this study ( 51, 52). 
 
Therefore, data from both groups of patients will be analyzed together. Historical data suggests 38% 
of patients  will be free of recurrence  at 3 years  (53), which  provides  us with approximate ly 80% power 
to detect a hazard ratio of 3.[ADDRESS_861565] and assumes  that extent  of hypoxia  is dichotomized  at observed  median  resulting  in equal 
group sizes and maximal power. This is  for planning purposes only. We will use Cox regression with 
extent of hypoxia as the covariate in two different ways: (1) lesion -based analysis with an estimating 
equations to account for multiple observations per patient; (2) patient -based where an aggre gate 
measure of extent of hypoxia (sum of the fraction of tumor volumes with k3>0.1 across all lesions) 
over all lesions within a patient) will be used as a covariate. In addition, a lesion and patient -based 
analyses for presence of hypoxia will also be co nsidered where, for the patient -based analysis, the 
aggregate measure will be defined as presence of hypoxia in at least one of the lesions.  
In an exploratory  analysis  to address  the secondary  objective  of assessing  the predictive  value  of FDG 
PET/CT in a group of twenty five lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy or concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy, we will use the concordance probability estimate from a proportional hazars 
regression  model  with SUV  as the predictor  for the outcomes  of survival  and progression -free survival. 
Time of origin will be the start time of therapy (neoadjuvant therapy, if applicable, concurrent 
chemoradiation or radiation alone otherwise). We will use these estimates to preliminarily determine 
whether BH PET/CT pr ovides greater predictive capability than Free -Breathing (FB) PET/CT. Since 
these analyses are exploratory findings will be interpreted as hypothesis -generating.  
 
We expect to accrue  one patient a  month for  each of the  two cohorts.

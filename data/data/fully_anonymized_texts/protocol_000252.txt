Protocol Number [ADDRESS_290711] common source of small bowel bleeding in the U.S. Over 50% of patients with bleeding angioectasias develop multiple lesions which recur over time. Current medical therapy for angioectasias is suboptimal as many patients continue to experience significant GI blood loss despi[INVESTIGATOR_239556] (Octreotide). Our goal is to evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid as medical therapy for bleeding intestinal angioectasias in a subpopulation of patients who have failed standard therapy or in whom standard therapy is contraindicated.

7 2 - Background 2.1 Background/prevalence of research topic Suspected small bowel bleeding (SSBB) is defined as iron deficiency anemia attributed to chronic gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss or overt GI bleeding which remains undefined in etiology after standard upper and lower endoscopy. SSBB accounts for 5% of all GI bleeding cases.[ADDRESS_290712] and colon should be considered, up to 75% of patients with SSBB are confirmed to have bleeding sources in the small bowel.2 Small bowel angioectasias (AE), which are also referred to as angiodysplasias or arterio-venous malformations, are identified as the source of bleeding in 30-40% of all SSBB cases and are the most common small bowel bleeding source in patients older than 50.[ADDRESS_290713] commonly found in the small bowel specifically in the jejunum, followed by [CONTACT_239573], stomach and right colon.4 The prevalence of gastrointestinal AE is estimated to be 0.9-3.0% in non-bleeding patients and up to 6% in patients with evidence of blood loss.5   AE's are a collection of dilated submucosal vessels composed of thin tortuous capi[INVESTIGATOR_239557].6 Per Yano-Yamamoto's accepted endoscopic classification system, small bowel AE are classified as type 1 lesions. These lesions are further subclassified as type 1a which are characterized by [CONTACT_239574] (<1mm) with or without oozing and type 1b which are classified as patchy erythema (2-3 mm) with or without oozing.[ADDRESS_290714] by [CONTACT_239575]. suggests that chronic intermittent obstruction of veins as they pass through the muscular layers of the bowel wall may cause dilation and increased pressure within the vessels. Due to chronic hypoperfusion, sympathetic nerve stimulation leads to relaxation of intestinal vascular smooth muscle, causing local vascular overload, dilation, and eventually, permanent AE.9 Dysregulated angiogenesis termed the "angiogenic theory" is an alternative theory which was first suggested by [CONTACT_239576]. They found that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelia growth factor (VEGF), both central mediators in angiogenesis, were significantly increased in patients with gastrointestinal AEs.10,11   Angioectasias are rarely seen in patients younger than age 50 except in cases of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Patient age is the primary risk factor for AE but these lesions have been associated with additional risk factors. Chronic renal failure, particularly end-stage renal disease, has been shown to predispose patients to the development of AEs due to uremic and metabolically driven platelet dysfunction.12—14 Aortic stenosis (AS) has also been studied extensively in association with development of AEs, an association known as Heyde syndrome, which may be related to an acquired form of von Willebrand disease.[ADDRESS_290715] device (LVAD) placement.16 Additional risk factors include tobacco use, obesity, use of antithrombotic agents, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic liver disease.4,17,18

8 Diagnosis of AEs With the introduction of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) and device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) in 2001, previous studies for SSBB including small bowel follow through, angiography, cross sectional imaging and nuclear scans are less commonly employed.19 Due to the anatomic features of the small bowel, conventional endoscopy provides limited evaluation of the deep small bowel.2,20 VCE is a simple noninvasive procedure which is well tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. Per the American Gastrointestinal Associate (AGA) guidelines, VCE is the first line investigation for small bowel evaluation in hemodynamically stable patients with no evidence of obstruction.21 DAE is usually reserved to pursue positive VCE findings that require intervention or in the setting of high clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_239558]. A large meta-analysis study by [CONTACT_239577]. found the diagnostic accuracy of VCE (60%) was similar to that of BE (57%).22   Interventional Management  Endoscopic management of AEs is difficult and only made possible through the relatively recent advent and development of BE. Endoscopic ablation using argon plasma coagulation (APC) is the most common technique used to treat gastrointestinal AE.23 Other endoscopic techniques include bipolar electrocautery, sclerotherapy injection and mechanical hemostasis using hemo clips or banding, which may be beneficial in larger lesions.24 A number of studies report an improvement in Hb, a reduction in transfusions and an improvement in overt bleeding following APC therapy for AE's.[ADDRESS_290716] a high re-bleeding rate of up to 60% for small bowel AEs with or without thermal intervention using double balloon enteroscopy, especially in those patients who required large amount of transfusion before DAE and those with multiple vascular lesions.2,26   Radiological embolization is a treatment technique considered for patients with active GI bleeding who are hemodynamically unstable or on which endoscopic therapy has failed. Mesenteric angiography is used to identity bleeding vessels which are subsequently embolized with micro-coils.27 Although the rate of hemostasis achieved by [CONTACT_239578], early recurrent bleeding was found to occur in an estimated 20% of patients.28 Moreover, severe complications such as arterial dissection and bowel infarction occurring in up to 17% of patients is a major limitation of embolization techniques.[ADDRESS_290717] to endoscopic ablation in patients with AE's as the majority of patients have multiple lesion which may be difficult to completely ablate with new lesions developi[INVESTIGATOR_239559]. Pharmacological treatments including iron supplementation, somatostatin analogues, hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239560]. Conservative management with iron supplementation given orally or intravenously is a mainstay of treatment for mild intestinal AE bleeding.[ADDRESS_290718] been used to treat AE. Hypothesized mechanisms include decreased duodenal and splanchnic blood flow, improved platelet aggregation, increased vascular resistance and inhibition of angiogenesis.31—33 Through a meta-analysis, Brown et al. report a clinical response rate of 76% compared to the natural progression of the disease and reduced blood product requirements.32 More recently, Nardone et al. performed a retrospective analysis and found that 40% of patients had a reduction of transfusion requirements over a 6-year mean follow up period.[ADDRESS_290719] been studied due to their potential for inhibition of angiogenesis in the development of new AE's. Thalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug with antiangiogenic properties, has been used to treat small bowel AEs when conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_239561].37,[ADDRESS_290720] shown a significant reduction in bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_239562]. However, the use of thalidomide is limited by [CONTACT_239579], hematological abnormalities and teratogenicity.39—41  As previously discussed, gastrointestinal AE's are known to strongly express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).11 Bevacizumab is a known anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody that has shown to be effective in decreasing bleeding events and the need for blood tranfusions in patients with HHT.42,43 Although effective, bevacizumab therapy is complicated by [CONTACT_239580], thromboembolic events, heart failure and nephrotic syndrome in up to 10% of patients.[ADDRESS_290721] profile.

10 Tranexamic Acid Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a hemostatic agent that is a synthetic reversible competitive inhibitor to the lysine receptor found on plasminogen. TXA works by [CONTACT_12789] a reversible complex that displaces plasminogen from fibrin resulting in the halting of fibrinolysis. TXA has been approved by [CONTACT_239581]. The antifibrinolytic agent has been further studied in the management of major bleeding in multiple clinical settings including trauma, obstetrics and neurosurgery.47,[ADDRESS_290722] in the possible applications of TXA.50   The literature contains a few case reports commenting on the successful use of TXA in patients with AE's, without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events.51,[ADDRESS_290723] a randomized placebo-controlled trial examining the use of oral TXA for acute lower GI bleeds requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Smith et al. found no improvement in average hemoglobin and transfusion rates following a four-day treatment regimen with oral TXA, however, the bleeding source for approximately 50% of the study population was diverticular in nature.[ADDRESS_290724] treatment with endoscopic ablation and iron supplementation.   The common side effects of TXA include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, itching, hypotension, and thromboembolic events as reported by [CONTACT_1622]. Contraindications include a history of venous or arterial thromboembolism, intracranial bleeding or active thromboembolic disease. TXA is not well studied in the renally impaired patient however it is 95% excreted in urine so renal dosing is recommended.[ADDRESS_290725] systemic review and meta-analysis examining TXA in GIB and found that the absolute risk of thromboembolic events to be <1%. This presents a small but statistically significant risk of DVT/PTE with high dose IV TXA but cannot be extrapolated to lower dose oral TXA regimens. Further, the safety profile of TXA has been confirmed and well-studied in the fields of trauma and orthopedics.55,[ADDRESS_290726] been treated with TXA therapy consisting or 650 mg oral tablets taken three times per day for 3 months. In 8 of those patients there was an observed clinical response defined as stabilization of hemoglobin which was not previously achieved with prior therapy. Although this sample size of patients was not a controlled study accounting for confounding variables, it does strongly highlight the potential beneficial therapeutic effects of TXA. Of note, there were no side effects observed by [CONTACT_941] 9 patients.

11 3 - Rationale/Significance 3.1 Problem Statement The current management of small bowel AE's is suboptimal as the majority of patients with symptomatic bleeding experience continued or recurrent bleeding despi[INVESTIGATOR_239563], octreotide and iron supplementation. In these cases, patients may require repeated transfusion of PRBC's as palliative treatment which is a source of morbidity including repeated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239564], iron overload, and volume overload. Patients with severe disease may develop antibodies to all blood products over time such that they can no longer tolerated PRBC transfusion. 3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact Currently, the mainstay of treatment for intestinal AEs includes endoscopic ablation combined with octreotide and iron supplementation. However, many patients continue to suffer from persistent or recurrent symptomatic anemia and often require repeated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239565]. TXA is a hemostatic agent that has the potential to be beneficial in patients with small bowel GI bleeding. Through our literature review multiple case reports have highlighted the impact TXA treatment can have on patients with intestinal AEs. Our study would help determine the potential additive effect of TXA in patients with symptomatic anemia due to GI AE's. Further, we seek to expand our knowledge of the applications of TXA with the goal of decreasing morbidity and mortality. 3.[ADDRESS_290727] to patient’s health and include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and stroke. Dionne et al. recently published the largest systemic review and meta-analysis examining TXA in GIB and found that the absolute risk of thromboembolic events to be <2%. This presents a small but statistically significant risk of DVT/PTE with high dose IV TXA but cannot be extrapolated to lower dose oral TXA regimens. Further, the safety profile of oral TXA has been confirmed and well-studied in the fields of trauma and orthopedics. Specifically, a large meta-analysis looking at the 5 RCTs comprising approximately 600 patients found no statistically significance increasing in thromboembolic complications between patients undergoing a total knee replacement who received oral TXA for intra/post-operative bleeding vs control patients. 55,[ADDRESS_290728] 75% of patients on TXA to have a 2 gm/dl improvement in overall hemoglobin while only 25% in placebo group see a 2gm/dl improvement. We expect 75% of TXA patients to require zero blood transfusions compared to placebo group requiring 1 blood transfusion on average per patient over 3 months. 4.2 Primary Objective To determine whether oral therapy with TXA results in improvement in serum hemoglobin concentration and/or requirement for PRBC transfusion compared to placebo in patients treated with standard endoscopic ablation and iron supplementation 4.3 Secondary Objectives (if applicable) To determine the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239566] [ADDRESS_290729] portion of the study, we will enroll approximately 50 patients with diagnosed intestinal AEs through VCE and/or endoscopy who experience symptomatic anemia despi[INVESTIGATOR_239567]. Subjects will be randomized to either the TXA treatment group versus the placebo treatment group for [ADDRESS_290730] initial complete blood counts (CBC) measured as a baseline then subsequent CBCs measured at 1, 2 and 3 months. Patients will be monitored for drug side effects, symptoms related to anemia, the need for blood transfusions and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_239554]/anemia. 5.1.1 Study Date Range and Duration The interventional portion of the study will be conducted over a 3-month period from March 2023 — May 2023. We will spend the months of December 2022 — February [ADDRESS_290731], interpret, analyze and summarize data from June — July 2023. 5.1.2 Number of Study Sites The study site includes the LSU Health Network GI Clinic at Ochsner Kenner Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  5.2 Outcome Variables 5.2.1 Primary Outcome Variables Primary outcome variables include hemoglobin concentration and the requirement of packed RBC transfusion. 5.2.2 Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables (if applicable) Secondary outcome variables include number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], endoscopic interventions (EGD, Colonoscopy, enterosocopy, video capsule endoscopy) and experienced side effects.  5.3 Study Population All newly diagnosed Adult patients with intestinal angioectasias following at the LSU Health Network GI Clinic who meet screening criteria will be considered for inclusion.

16 6 - Methods 6.1 Treatment - Drug Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a hemostatic prescription medication available in the US and internationally. TXA is a synthetic reversible competitive inhibitor to the lysine receptor found on plasminogen. The binding of this receptor prevents plasmin from binding to and ultimately stabilizing the fibrin matrix. It is available in intravenous and oral formulations, however for this study we will focus on the oral regimen. Oral TXA has a half-life of up to 10 hours and a bioavailability of 50% resulting in the TID dosing regimen chosen for this study.57 TXA is currently FDA approved for menorrhagia and short-term prevention following tooth extraction in patients with hemophilia. 6.1.1 Dosage, Admin, Schedule (if applicable) Patients in the intervention group will be treated with TXA 650 mg three times per day for 3 months. This dosing regimen has been studied in patients with heavy menstrual bleeding and found to be beneficial with limited side effects.58 6.1.2 Method of Assignment/Randomization (if applicable) Allocation concealment will be used to make sure the individual enrolling the trial subjects into the study has no bias towards group assignment. A statistician not directly involved in the analysis of the study will use simple randomization to create the two arms of the study (TXA vs placebo). Randomization will be carried out by [CONTACT_239582], excluding the number zero. If an even number is generated, the patient will be placed in the TXA treatment arm, and if an odd number is generated the patient will be placed in the control (placebo) arm. This process will be repeated until there are 25 patients in each group. 6.1.3 Packaging/Labelling Both TXA and placebo will be packaged in identical bottles with similar labeling so participants and the research team will not be affected by [CONTACT_239583]. 6.1.4 Storage Conditions Both TXA and placebo will be stored at the Ochsner Kenner inpatient pharmacy prior to the start of the interventional portion of the study. Participants will pi[INVESTIGATOR_239569]. 6.2 Assessments 6.2.1 Safety/Pregnancy-related policy Pregnancy is included in the exclusion criteria for this study. If female identifying participants were to consent to be part of the study, they will undergo a serum pregnancy testing prior to the start of the study 6.2.2. Adverse Events Definition and Reporting Medical Monitoring  Data will be collected by [CONTACT_239584] [ADDRESS_290732] access to study personnel via a dedicated cellular phone. Definition and Classification of Adverse Events  Adverse events will include medication side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, itching, hypotension, and thromboembolic events. 
Protocol Number 4587 3 January 2023 - Version 3 
17 Data Collection for Adverse Events  Adverse events will be noted in each participant's file. Their responses to the biweekly phone calls and monthly clinic visits about new symptoms related to the study medication will be reviewed and followed up promptly. Adverse events will be grading according to the following scale: • Mild: An experience that is transient and requires no special treatment or intervention. The experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities. • Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. The experience impacts usual daily activities. • Severe: An experience that require therapeutic intervention. The experience interrupts usual daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment, it becomes a severe adverse event. Each adverse event will be assessed and determine to be related or not related to the study medication.   6.2.3 Pharmacokinetics (if applicable) The bioavailability of oral TXA is 30-50% of the ingested dose and is not affected by [CONTACT_217643]. Urinary excretion is the primary means of TXA elimination with 95% of an administered dose being processed by [CONTACT_239585]. The half-life of IV TXA was found to be 2 hours with the mean terminal half-life as approximately 11 hours 6.3 Study Procedures 6.3.1 Informed Consent Each patient that meets inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked to fill out and sign the informed consent statement. A copy is attached for reference.  6.3.[ADDRESS_290733] an initial meeting with research study staff where all questions will be answered. Demographics will be obtained, informed consent will be signed and patient will be enrolled in study. Once enrolled, baseline lab work as previously stated will be collected for the study.  6.3.4 On Study Visits Research study participants will meet for a screening and consent visit. At this time, inclusion/exclusion criteria will be review and if meet then they will be consented for the study. Following, demographic information will be collected, and baseline lab work will be done prior to the start of the interventional portion of the study. 6.3.[ADDRESS_290734] any exit visit with the research staff. At this time, they will fill out a final patient questionnaire (see appendix). 
Protocol Number [ADDRESS_290735] another follow up interview at the 6-month period (3 months following the end of the interventional portion of the study) to conclude the study. 6.3.6 Removal of subjects • At the time of consent, participants will be informed that their participation in this research study is voluntary and they may discontinue participation without penalty at any time. • Subjects will be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_239586]. • Data collection prior to participant withdrawal may be retained and used in a manner that is consistent with study design and purpose unless participant expresses that their information to not used in the study 6.[ADDRESS_290736] important aim for providing information to support future recommendations with regards to TXA in patients with intestinal AE. A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled with 1:[ADDRESS_290737] 80% power to detect an average increase of 25% from baseline to 3 months between TXA and placebo groups (α = 0.05). We expect 75% of patients on TXA to have a 2 gm/dl improvement in overall hemoglobin while only 25% in placebo group see a 2gm/dl improvement. We expect 75% of TXA patients to require zero blood transfusions compared to placebo group requiring [ADDRESS_290738] to baseline and follow up hemoglobin/hematocrit (H/H) and other endpoints previously described. We will summarize demographics and other predictors of clinical status. Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_8477], standard deviation and rage as appropriate. The primary analysis will compare the absolute and percent change in hemoglobin with adjustment for baseline in linear regression models. Using multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for baseline hemoglobin, we will assess if the odds of achieving a clinically relevant improvement in hemoglobin differs by [CONTACT_15500]. The secondary outcomes will be analyzed similarly using linear regression models adjusting for baseline values. 6.4.3 Handling of Missing Data Every effort will be made to secure data and account for all data points. If missing data was to occur, it would be noted during the statistical analysis and clearly outlined in the discussion portion of future manuscripts.

Raines's office in a locked cabinet. 7.3 Deviations/Unanticipated Problems We will attempt to minimize missing data; however, we have planned for its occurrence. For subjects lost to follow-up, we will use all of the information available until the end of follow-up. This protocol will continue to follow subjects and perform lab tests even if a subject drops-out from the treatment portion of the study. If a subject decides that he/she does not wish to continue taking the study drug, the subject will stop the investigational treatment, but will still be strongly encouraged to continue to follow-up with the study personnel for all scheduled study follow ups (e.g., lab draws and symptom reporting), so that missing data will be minimized. 7.4 Data Collection A majority of data/surveys/questionnaires will be electronically collected and stored on REDCap. 7.5 Data or Specimen Storage/Security All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_239570] a secure location within [CONTACT_239588]'s office in a locked cabinet. Communication about study data will be strictly conducted via LSUHSC email accounts.  7.6 Study Discontinuation Reasons for discontinuing the study include futility, adverse events (harm), early evidence of superiority of one intervention (benefit) and insufficient recruitment (a cut-off at 80% of the planned sample size).  7.[ADDRESS_290740] a follow up interview at the 6-month period (3 months following the end of the interventional portion of the study) to conclude the study.

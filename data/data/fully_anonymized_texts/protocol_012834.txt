CONFIDENTIAL    Protocol Synopsis  
Title:   A Phase 1, Open- label, Single-D ose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and 
Pharmacokinetics of AMG 986 Administered Orally  to Healthy Volunteers and Subjects with 
Severely Impaired Renal Function     
Study Phase:   1   
Indication:   Heart Failure 
Primary Objective:    
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 986 following the administration of a 
single oral 200 mg dose to healthy volunteers and subjects with severely impaired renal 
function. 
Secondary Objective:   
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 986 f ollowing single oral dose 
administration to subjects with severely impaired renal function relative to heathy 
matched control subjects .  
Exploratory Objectives:   
• To determine unbound concentrations of AMG 986 in plasma.  
• To determine AMG 986 metabolite conc entrations in plasma.  
Hypothes is:   
• Clinically significant changes in AMG 986 PK that would require dose adjustment are not 
expected in subjects with severe renal impairment when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function. 
Primary Endpoint s:   
• AMG [ADDRESS_760266] quantifiable sample (AUC 0-t) and maximum observed plasma 
concentration after dosing (C max).  Additional  AMG 986 PK parameters may include but 
not limited to terminal phase half -life (t 1/2); time of maximum AMG 986 plasma 
concentration (t max); and AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC inf). 
Secondary Endpoint:    
• Subject incidence of adverse events and clinically significant changes in vital signs, 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs  
Exploratory Endpoints:    
• Plasma protein binding of AMG 986  
• AMG 986 metabolite concentrations in plasma 
Study Design :   
This is a phase 1, multicenter, open- label, single- dose study conducted in subjects wit h severely 
impaired renal function as determined by [CONTACT_578604] r enal disease (MDRD) 
equation for  estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  Approximately 12 subjects will be 
assigned to the two treatment  groups  in the study . Approximately 6 subjects with severely 
impaired renal function (eGFR  15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m2) will be assigned to group 1; 
approximately 6 subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) will be assigned 
to the control group 2.   All subjects in each group will receive a single oral dose of [ADDRESS_760267]:  A MG 986 
Protocol Number:  20150186 
Date:  28 September 2017  Page 4 of 73 
CONFIDENTIAL    An attempt will be made to match t he control group of healthy males and females with normal 
renal function (group 2) to the group of subjects with severely impaired renal function (group 1) by 
[CONTACT_80343], body weight  range, gender  (proportion of male and female subjects ), and race.  
Enrollment of subjects in the control group will be initiated after all subjects in the renal 
impairment (RI) group have been enrolled.  The mean age ± 5 years and mean body weight  
± 10% of the subjects in the RI group will be used to help match the subjects in the control group.  
The priority for matching subject characteristics  of the two groups will be: age range, body weight  
range, gender, then race.   
Sample Size:   The sample size, approximately [ADDRESS_760268] Eligibility Criteria:    
Males or females ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of age, with a BMI of ≥ 18 and ≤ 38 kg/m2 at screening.  
• Subjects enrolled in group [ADDRESS_760269] severe RI (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2). It will 
be anticipated that these subjects will not require hemodialysis or renal transplantation, 
and will have renal function appropriate to severe RI for the duration of the study.   
• Subjects enrolled in group 2 will be  subjects with normal renal function 
(eGFR  ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2).   
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_760270] Dosage and Administration :   
AMG  986 for oral administration will be provided as 25 mg tablet s in 15- count bottles. All su bjects 
will receive a single oral dose of 200 mg AMG  986. 
Procedures:    
Screening 
After informed consent has been obtained, all screening procedures and tests to establish eligibility will be performed within [ADDRESS_760271] 
administration.   Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on day -1 for residency.   
Treatment  
On the morning of day 1, enrolled subjects will receive IP by [CONTACT_578605] a single 
200 mg dose on an empty stomach (no food or liquids, except water , for at least 8 hours prior to 
dose administration).  Subjects will remain in a fasted state (no food or liquids, except water) for 
at least 2 hour s after dose administration.   Subjec ts will reside at the research facility  until 
day 2 procedures ha ve been completed,  according to the Schedule of Assessments. Subjects will 
be discharged and will be provided with instructions to return to the research facility at specified 
time points to complete procedures through the end of the study  (according to the Schedule of 
Assessments).    
All adverse events, including serious adverse events, and use of concomitant medication will be collected for the duration of the study.  
End of Study  
Subjects will be followed through day 30.  Subject participation is complete once end- of-study 
(EOS) procedures are performed.   
All adverse events (including serious adverse events and deaths) and use of concomitant medication will be collected for the duration of the study up to and including the EOS visit.  If

Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). 
Statistical Considerations:    
PK paramet ers of total AMG [ADDRESS_760273] deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages . PK parameters  
and clinical lab data will be summarized at each time point when samples  are collected.   
Additionally, 90% confidence intervals will be calculated for the mean group difference ie,  the 
geometric mean ratio (GMR)  after back -transforming.
 These 90% CIs will be tabulated and 
presented for all PK parameters  compared .  Assuming 20% for the intra- subject standard 
deviation for AMG 986 log– transformed PK parameters (AUC 0-t and Cmax) and assuming that it is 
the same in the 2 groups, the current sample size of 6 would provide a CI for the GMR of (0.81,  1.23).  The number and percentage of subjects reporting any treatment -emergent  adverse 
event will be tabulated by [CONTACT_42893], preferred term, and renal function group. With 
12 subjects receiving AMG 986, there is a 46% chance of seeing an AE with a 5% incidence rate.  
Clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests will be noted.  For a 
full description of statistical analysis methods, please refer to Section 10.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
AMG 986 is a novel apelin receptor (APJ) small molecule agonist that binds and 
activates APJ receptor to improve cardiac function by [CONTACT_578608], by [CONTACT_578609], and by [CONTACT_578610] a significant impact on heart rate and myocardial oxygen consumption.  AMG 986 is being developed as a potential treatment for heart failure.  
2.1  Disease   
Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome marked by [CONTACT_578611] a diversity of diseases that afflict the heart .  With a 1-year rate of 
cardiovascular mortality or HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578584] 30% to 40% in patients recently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54687], symptomatic HF is associated with a worse prognosis than the 
majority of cancers .  It is a common and debilitating disease, affecting almost 6 million 
Americans, or mor e than 2% of the [LOCATION_002] population ( McMurray and 
Pfeffer, 2005; Roger et al, 2012).  However, cumulative evidence from epi[INVESTIGATOR_578585] 40 years despi[INVESTIGATOR_578586] ( Khand et al, 2000).  The 
pathophysiologic mechanisms for the progressive nature of HF are complex and include 
neurohormonal activation in addition to deranged cardiovascular hemodynamics .  Injury 
may occur following acute damage to heart muscle, such as with myocardial infarction, 
infection, or inflammatory processes, or may have a more gradual onset as in the case 
with infiltrative diseases, hemodynamic pressure or volume overloading, or hereditary 
cardiomyopathy .  HF is a progressive disorder with a natural history punctuated by 
[CONTACT_289456]:  AMG 986 
Protocol Number:  20150186 
Date:  28 September 2017  Page 15 of 73 
CONFIDENTIAL    frequent recurrent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578587].  Long-term goals of HF therapy 
are to implement chronic interventions that decrease death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715] 
(Jessup et al, 2009; McMurray et al, 2012), both of which occur frequently 
(Lloyd-Jones  et al, 2010).  More recently, efforts have been made in developi[INVESTIGATOR_578588], symptoms of HF and functional capacity .  While 
several interventions have been shown to reduce the rate of HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_578589], including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor blockers, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and biventricular pacing (Krum and Teerlink,  2011), mortality and morbidity still remain high .  In addition, these 
available treatments that are aimed at diverse targets often fail to control symptoms or restore quality of life.  
Another target for treatment of HF is to improve myocardial contraction and relaxation.  
HF is a co ndition most commonly marked by [CONTACT_578612] a diastolic dysfunction component.  Systolic dysfunction 
predominates in the condition of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), whereas diastolic dysfunction predominates in the condition of heart failure with 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).  Over time, in an attempt to preserve cardiac 
output, a series of compensatory changes can occur in both conditions, characterized by 
[CONTACT_578613] t one and peripheral vasoconstriction, as well as the activation of 
various neurohormonal pathways .  Accordingly, improvement of cardiac contraction and 
relaxation would appear to be a rational therapeutic approach to the treatment of HF (Hasenfuss and Teerl ink, 2011).  Attempts to improve cardiac contractility using 
adrenergic receptor agonists (ie, dobutamine) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (ie, milrinone) have been met with little success, however .  These mechanisms have 
significant safety liabilities att ributable to increased oxygen consumption, intracellular 
calcium, and arrhythmias ( Cuffe et al, 2002;  Felker et al, 2003).  AMG 986 is being 
developed to address the unmet needs not only in heart failure with a systolic component but with a diastolic component as well, without the aforementioned safety liabilities.  
Non-cardiac comorbidities including chronic kidney disease (CKD) are extremely 
common in HF patients .  In a meta analysis of the published literature that included 
57 studies that evaluated CKD i n HF patients, the pooled prevalence of CKD was 
reported as 32% in all HF patients, 53% in acute HF patients, and 42% in chronic HF patients ( Damman et al, 2014) . In the same publication, the pooled rate of worsening

CONFIDENTIAL    renal function was reported as 23% in all HF patients, 23% in acute HF patients, and 
25% in chronic HF patients.  In the US, the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National 
Registry (ADHERE) Cohort showed that the prevalence of moderate (Stage III), severe 
without  dialysis (Stage IV), and severe with dialysis (Stage V) renal dysfunction was 
41.2%, 11.5%, and 6.6%, respectively for males, and 45.7%, 14.8%, and 7.3%, 
respectively for females (Heywood et al, 2007) . In the same meta-analysis 
(Damman et al, 2014) the mortality rate was also estimated: at baseline, the pooled 
mortality rate was 16% in HF patients with CKD and 11% in HF patients without CKD, after a mean follow -up of 681 days. The pooled unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of all -cause 
mortality in HF patients with CKD vs HF patients without CKD was 2.34 (95%  confidence interval [CI], 2.2 -2.5). Furthermore, worsening renal failure during 
the course of disease was also correlated to mortality when compared with patients 
without worsening renal failure (pooled unadjusted OR = 1.81 [95% CI, 1.55-2.12]). The 
use of some HF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as ACE inhibitors and loop diuretics, can result in acute renal failure or acute worsening of pre-existing chronic kidney dysfunction. Acute 
worsening of cardiac output can also lead to decreases in renal function 
(Ezzat  et al, 2015; Tariq and Aronow, 2015; McMurray et al, 2012; Schoolwerth et al,  
2001). Therefore, the knowledge of the safety and pharmacokinetic behavior of AMG 
986, being developed as a promising therapy for heart failure patients, in subjects with renal dysfunction is extremely relevant.

AMG 986 had beneficial effects on cardiac function that were additive to those of the

AMG 986 increased cardiac contractile reserve, ejection fraction and stroke volume.  Improvements in ventricul o-arterial coupling were also observed in ZSF1 rats .  In two

Non-clinical Pharmacokinetics  
AMG 986 PK after single IV or oral dose administration was characterized in male 
CD1 mice, male Sprague-Dawley rats, male beagle dogs, and male cynomolgus 
monkeys.  Following a single IV dose, the clearance (CL) of AMG 986 was low in mouse 
and dog and moderate in rat and monkey, relative to hepatic blood flow .  Estimates of 
apparent steady -state volume of distribution (V

mean estimates of elimination half -life (t 1/2,z) ranged from 2.[ADDRESS_760293] of AMG 986 clearance in

approximately 73% in rats and 98% in dogs.  
AMG 986 was highly bound to plasma protein and did not preferentially distribute into blood cells when assessed in vitro across species.  AMG 986 was 99.6% bound in 
human plasma.  The metabolism of AMG 986 in vitro was principally catalyzed by 
[CONTACT_143025]3A.  Oxidized metabolites of AMG 986 were formed across species with no 
unique human metabolites observed in liver microsome and hepatocyte incubations.   
AMG 986 was an inducer of CYP3A4 in vitro at clinical ly relevant AMG 986 
concentrations, as determined by [CONTACT_578614]3A4 mRNA levels in primary human 
hepatocytes.  AMG 986 was not an inhibitor in vitro of any of the major drug 
metabolizing human CYP enzymes.  AMG 986 was characterized in vitro as a subs trate 
of P glycoprotein (P -gp) and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) 
transporters.  Details of AMG 986 nonclinical pharmacokinetics are summarized in the AMG 986 Investigator’s Brochure.

CONFIDENTIAL    Human Pharmacokinetics  
Preliminary PK analyses were conducted in 54 healthy subjects who had received 
AMG 986 by [CONTACT_578615] 20150183.  A 
total of 4 oral dose cohorts ( 24 subjects) and 5 intravenous (IV) dose cohorts 
(30 subjects) have been studied.    
After single oral dose administration at 5 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg, mean 
estimates of terminal half -life ranged from  13.2 to 18.0 hours, absorption was rapid with 
median estimates of T max that ranged from  1.0 to 2.0 hours and oral bioavailability 
ranged from  61% to 80% (Table 1 ). 
Pharmacokinetic dose proportionality was not assessed formally; however, exposure to 
AMG 986 generally increased with increased oral AMG  986 doses.  
The excretion of unchanged AMG 986 in urine was low in subjects who received 
AMG 986 by [CONTACT_578616] 0.5 mg/1 hour or 3 mg/1 hour.  In IV cohorts 1 and 2, 
approximately 4% of dose was excreted unchanged within 12 hours following IV dosing 
and minimal additional excretion of dose occurred between 12 and 48 hours after IV 
administration.

CONFIDENTIAL    2.2.3  Toxicology  
Nonclinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicology package for  AMG 986 includes repeat dose toxicology studies 
with both oral (28-day studies in rat and dog) and IV (14-day studies in rat and dog) dose 
routes , developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits (oral 
dosing), as well as genetic toxicology, phototoxicity and safety pharmacology studies.  
Repeat Dose Toxicology Studies : 
In the 28-day oral toxicology studies, estimates of AUC 24h exposures in rats  and dogs  at 
the no-observed-(adverse) -effect -level ( NO[A]EL) doses were 4-fold and 6-fold greater 
than the human exposure at 200 mg, respectively (Table 1 ).  These  margins from the 
toxicology studies support the planned oral dose of 200 mg. 
In developmental and reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits, oral 
administration of AMG 986 resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at all doses tested.  In rats,  
AMG 986-related fetal tail abnormalities and skeletal dysmorphogenesis were observed.  In rabbits there were abortions, lower maternal body weights/ body weight gains , and 
decreases in embryo-fetal survival.   
AMG 986 was negative in both in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies and in an in 
vitro phototoxicity assay.  
Safety Pharmacology:  
The NOEL for effects on neurobehavioral and respir atory function in rats was 
1000 mg/kg (single oral dose).  In an anesthetized IV dog cardiovascular (CV) study, 
AMG 986 related CV effects were limited to small increases ( ~10%) in the rate of left 
ventricular pressure rise in early systole (dP/dtmax) and similar increases ( ~10%) in 
mean blood pressure at plasma concentrations greater than 1.34 µg/mL.  In the 
conscious dog telemetry study, there were no AMG 986-related effects on 
hemodynamics (blood pressure and heart rate) or ECG parameters (PR, QRS, QT or 
heart r ate-corrected QTc intervals) after single oral doses up to 300 mg/kg.  No effects 
on QT/QTc interval were observed in the anesthetized or conscious dog safety 
pharmacology studies and there were no changes in QTc interval in the 28-day oral or 14-day IV dog toxicology studies . 
The IC50 value for inhibitory effect of AMG 986 on hERG current (IKr current) was 
estimated to be > 300 µM (157 µg/mL, unbound concentration), more than 3000-fold

Protocol Number:  20150186 
Date:  [ADDRESS_760294] dose of AMG 986.  These inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will prevent pregnancy and mitigate the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity. 
AMG 986 has a potential risk of causing changes in blood pressure.  AMG 986 is 
expected to positively stimulate the endogenous apelin-dependent pathways, which include vasodilation.  Therefore, expected acute risks associated with AM G 986 are of  a 
cardiovascular nature, such as hypotension, although other effects, such as tachycardia or even hypertension cannot be excluded.  
Overall, t he nonclinical (toxicology and safety pharmacology) package suggests a safe 
profile at the doses planned in clinical trials with AMG 986.  Genetic toxicology and 
photosafety evaluations indicated that AMG 986 is not genotoxic or phototoxic.  No AMG 986-related toxicity was identified in the rat or dog toxicology studies that were 
conducted with oral (28-d ay studies) or IV (14-day studies) dose administration.  The 
AUC exposure margins based on NO(A)EL doses from the rat and dog toxicology studies support the planned clinical dose range.  Additionally, no AMG 986-related effects in the safety pharmacology s tudies were identified, and data indicat e that QTc 
interval prolongation risk is low.  
Developmental and reproductive toxicology studies identified a risk for embryo-fetal toxicity as described above.  
As of 14 March 2017,  safety and tolerability data on clinical exposure to AMG 986 from 
FIH study 20150183 (a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, single day 
ascending dose and multi ple daily ascending dose study ) were available and reviewed 
for [ADDRESS_760295]:  AMG 986

CONFIDENTIAL    (loading doses up to 20 mg over 1 hour followed by [CONTACT_578617] 120 mg 
over 23 hours)  and placebo.   There was a total of [ADDRESS_760296] and not related to an adverse event.  
For these 72 subjects, no serious adverse events, no adverse events with fatal outcome, 
and no discontinuation of IP due to adverse event s were reported.  There were no 
adverse events from the cardiac disorders system organ class.  Twelve subjects (16.7%) were reported to have treatment emergent adverse events  during double-blind 
treatment .  The most common event was headache, which occurred in 5 subjects 
(6.9%).  The event of headache was reported as a common terminology criteria for 
adverse events (CTCAE) severity grade [ADDRESS_760297].  No 
events were CTCAE grade ≥[ADDRESS_760298] changes in vital sign s 
(including blood pressure) were identified within or across any of the 9 cohorts.  There 
was no notable variation in the vital signs with the increasing doses of AMG 986 throughout the study .  Additionally, no laboratory (including troponin I) or ECG 
abnormalities were detected.  
In summary, t he clinical experience accumulated with AMG [ADDRESS_760299] that the administration of AMG 986 at the proposed clinical dose is safe.   All 
doses tested thus far were well tolerated and an acceptable safety profile was observed.  Pregnant women should not take AMG 986.  
2.4 Rationale  
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of AMG 986 in male and/or 
female subjects with severely impaired renal function relative to heathy matched control 
subjects .  All subjects will receive IP in a fasted state as a single [ADDRESS_760300]:  AMG 986 
Protocol Number:  20150186 
Date:  [ADDRESS_760301] not been selected for study in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_578591] 986 in 
patients with heart failure, a single dose of 200 mg was selected for this study .  Selection 
of the 200 mg oral dose level for evaluation was based on the following: (1)  observed 
AMG 986 PK results in healthy subjects  (2) acceptable safety and tolerability of a single 
oral dose up to 400 mg in study 20150183 (3 ) acceptable safety and tolerability of 
multipl e daily oral dose of 200 mg.  A lthough dose proportionality was not formally 
evaluated in the FIH study, increases in AUC and C
max exposures appeared to be linear 
and proportional to dose over the 5 to 200 mg oral dose range tested.     
Evaluation of AMG 986 PK in subjects with renal impairment at the planned dose will 
allow the conclusions of this study to be applied to subsequent studies where a dose as 
high as 200 mg could be tested.  
2.5 Clinical Hypothes is 
Clinically significant changes in AMG 986 PK that would require dose adjustment are not 
expected in subjects with severe renal impairment when compared to subjects with 
normal renal function.  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a  phase 1, multicenter,  open-label , single-dose study conducted in subjects with 
severely impaired renal function as determined by [CONTACT_10495] 
(eGFR).  The eGFR is estimated using the 4-Parameter Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (Levey et al, 2009). Approximately 12 subjects will be 
assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups .  Approximately 6 subjects with severely impaired 
renal function (eGFR 15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m
2) will be assigned to group 1; 
approximately 6 subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) will be 
assigned to the control group 2.  All subjects will be assigned to receive a single 
oral dose of 200 mg AMG 986.  
An attempt will be made to match the control group of healthy males and females with normal renal function (group 2) to the group of subjects with severely impaired renal

female subjects), and race.  The mean age ± 5 years and mean body weight ± 10% of 
the subjects in the severely renal impaired group will be used to help match the subjects 
in the control  group.  The priority for matching subject characteristics of the two groups 
will be: age range, body weight range, gender, then race.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1. 
3.2 Number of Sites  
This study will be conducted at approximately  3 clinical research facilities in the United 
States.  Sites that do not enroll subjects within 1 month of site initiation may be closed.

Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects”.   Approximately 
[ADDRESS_760302] up to approximately 58 days, including a 28-day screening 
period prior to administration of AMG 986 and an on-study period lasting up to 30 days.    
3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion:   The primary completion date is defined as the date when the 
last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the 
primary endpoint(s), for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was  terminated early.   
The primary completion date is the date when the last subject has completed

5.1 Treatment Assignment  
This is a phase 1, open-label, non-randomized study conducted in subjects with severely 
impaired renal function as determined by [CONTACT_85794]

severe RI (eGFR 15 to 29 m L/min/1.73 m
2) or normal renal function 
(eGFR  ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 or above).  
Subjects with severely impaired renal function (eGFR 15 to 29 ml/min/1.73 m2) will be 
assigned to group 1.   Subjects with normal renal function will be assigned to the control 
group 2.  Enrollment of subjects in the control group will be initiated after all subjects in 
the RI  group have been enrolled.

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre-existing medical condition or underlying disease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened more 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study, or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, 
is not considered an adverse event.   
If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the wors t severity on the Event CRF.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21884], refer to Section 8.[ADDRESS_760363] 1 of the 
following serious criteria:  
• fatal 
• life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242]

CONFIDENTIAL    An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug induced liver injury 
(DILI) (see Appendix  A for DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an 
emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  A dverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by [CONTACT_578623] -Up Visit/ End of Study Visit are reported using the Event CRF.  
The investigator  must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  
• Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  
• Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],  
• Assessment of relatedness to investigational product  (AMG 986) , and/or any 
study -mandated activity/procedure(s), and  
• Action taken 
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.  The grading scale used in this study is described in 
Appendix  A.   
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the investigational product  (AMG 986) .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the quest ion:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_7198] ?  Relatedness means that there are facts or 
reasons to support a relationship between investigational product and the event.  
The investigator must as sess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any study 
mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], use of medical device(s) and/or procedure (including any screening procedure(s)).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:

activity (eg,  administration of investigational product, protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], use of 
medical device(s)) , and/or procedure”?  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general,  abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adv erse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_358639] [ADDRESS_760364]  (AMG  986) or the 
Safety Follow -Up Visit/ End of Study  Visit, whichever is later are recorded in the subject’s 
medical record and are submitted to [COMPANY_010].  All serious adverse events must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event 
via the Event CRF.  
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the 
serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] via an electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Contingency Report  Form within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event.   See Appendix  B for a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event Worksheet/electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  
For EDC studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to 
[COMPANY_010] via the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be 
entered into the EDC system when the system is again available.  
The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
the investigational product  (AMG 986) . This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been

The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010].  All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_760366] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].   
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice.  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other  adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with 
local regulatory requirements and procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol-required 
Reporting Period 
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study.  However, these serious 
adverse events can be reported to [COMPANY_010].  In some countries (eg, European U nion [EU] 
member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event.

10.1 Study Endpoints, Analysis Sets, and Covariates  
10.1.1  Study Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Endpoint s 
• AMG [ADDRESS_760370] quantifiable sample (AUC 0-t) and 
maximum observed plasma concentration after dosing (C max).  Additional  
AMG 986 PK parameters may include but not limited to terminal phase 
half-life (t1/2); time of maximum AMG 986 plasma concentration (t max); and AUC 
from time  0 to infinity (AUC inf). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Endpoint    
• Subject incidence of adverse events and clinically significant changes in vital 
signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests , and ECGs  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory Endpoints  
• Plasma protein binding of AMG 986 
• AMG 986 metabolite concentrations in plasma  
10.1.2  Analysis Sets 
For all analyses, subjects will be analyzed according to the group they were assigned.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set w ill consist of all study subjects who receive at least one dose of 
AMG 986.   Subjects withdrawing prior to AMG 986 administration due to adverse events 
related to study procedure will not be included in the safety analysis set but those 
adverse events will  be included in the adverse events listing for all enrolled subjects.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set  
The PK analysis set will consist of all subjects for whom at least one PK parameter or 
endpoint can be reliably estimated.

CONFIDENTIAL    Group 1 will be the group formed with subjects with severely impaired renal function. 
Group 2, the group formed with subjects with normal renal function, will be considered 
the control group.  An effort will be made to match the subjects in group 2, the normal 
renal function group to the subjects in group 1, by [CONTACT_80343], body weight, gender , and 
race.  The mean age ± 5 years and mean body weight ± 10% of the subjects in the severely renal impaired group will be used to help match the subjects in the 
control  group.   No subgroup analyses are planned.  
10.1.4  Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data  
Incomplete data in the Primary Endpoint s will be excluded from analysis.  The number 
and frequency of missing values will be reported in the final study report.  
Imputation for missing or incomplete dates will be performed, if required.   If imputed 
dates are used, they will be identified as such in the final study report.  
PK concentrations below the lower limit of quantification will be set to zero.   
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
This is a Phase 1 study and no formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed.  The study is designed to characterize AMG 986 PK and safety plus tolerability, following 
a single oral administration of a 200-mg dose by [CONTACT_578624].  The sample size of this study is based on practical considerations and is 
consistent with the number of subjects enrolled in similar studies.  Approximately 
12 subjects ( 6 subjects with severe RI and 6 subjects with normal renal function) will be 
enrolled for the study. Assuming 20% for the int ra-subject standard deviation for 
AMG986 log-transformed PK parameters (AUC0-t and Cmax) and assuming that it is the 
same in the 2 groups, the current sample size of 6 would provide a C onfidence Interval 
for the Geometric Mean Ratio of the parameters of (0.81, 1.23).  For safety 
considerations, with a total of 12 subjects receiving AMG 986, there is a 46% chance of 
detecting an adverse event with a true incidence of 5% and a 72% chance of detecting a 
more common adverse event with a true incidence rate of 10%.

CONFIDENTIAL    Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the electronic CRFs must be 
maintained and readily available.  
• Updates to electronic CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s 
“audit trail”.  
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data management review is performed on subject data received at [COMPANY_010].  During this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution and subsequently closed by [CONTACT_53435].  
• The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this electronic data capture study.  This signature [CONTACT_53442], the data queries, and agrees with the content.  
[COMPANY_010] (or designee) will perform Self -Evident Corrections (SEC) to obvious data errors 
in the clinical trial database.  SECs will be documented in the CRF Standard I nstructions 
and the CRF Specific Instructions, both of these will be available through the EDC 
system.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by [CONTACT_11337] (or designee)  
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (ie, the same results sent twice with the same 
date with different visit, [eg, week 4 and early termination]) and updating a specific response if the confirming datum is provided in the “other, specify” field (eg, for race, reason for ending study).  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator is responsible for complying with the requirements for all assessments and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments , the investigator can search publically avail able records 
[where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

CONFIDENTIAL    staff, the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter.  
The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate as  defined in the Publication 
Charter.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described below are to be met for every publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICM JE) Recommendations for 
the Conduct  of Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical 
Journals, which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the 
work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3 and 4.  
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for corporate review.  The Clinical  Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, 
and timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.

Adverse Event Grading Scale  
The CTCAE version 4.0 is available at the following location:   
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting & Additional Assessments  
Reporting 
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.3 require 
the following:  
• The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of 
discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations have been concluded)  
• The appropriate CRF (eg, Event CRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitat e the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the [COMPANY_010].  
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation 
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in 
Section 6.[ADDRESS_760384] or ALT elevations >  [ADDRESS_760385] or 2-fold increase 
above baseline values for subjects with evaluated values before drug are to undergo a 
period of “close observation” until abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s 
baseline levels.  Assessments that are to be performed during this period include:  
• Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
• In cases of TBL > 2x ULN or INR > 1.5, retesting of liver tests, BIL (total and direct), 
and INR is to be performed every 24 hours until laboratory abnormalities improve 
• Testing frequency of the above laboratory tests may decrease if the abnormalities 
stabilize or the investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have 
been discontinued AND the subject is asymptomatic.  
• Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated 
TBL.  The following are to be considered depending on the clinical situation: 
− Complete blood count (CBC) with differential to assess for eosinophilia 
− Serum total immunoglobulin IgG, Anti -nuclear antibody (ANA), Anti Smooth 
Muscle Antibody, and Liver Kidney Microsomal antibody 1 (LKM1) to assess for 
autoimmune hepati tis

CONFIDENTIAL    − Serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels  
− A more detailed history of:  
o Prior and/or concurrent diseases or illness  
o Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
o Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, 
hypersensitivit y-type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and fever  
o Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs and special diets  
o Concomitant use of medications (including non-prescription medicines and herbal and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
− Viral serologies  
− CPK, haptoglobin, LDH, and peripheral blood smear  
− Appropriate liver imaging if clinically indicated 
• Appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis if this has not already been 
collected  
• Hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with an 
hepatologist)  
• Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormalities return to baseline or normal  or considered stable by [CONTACT_093] .  
The “close observation period” is to continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_760386](s) and protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications and laboratory results must be captured in corresponding CRFs.

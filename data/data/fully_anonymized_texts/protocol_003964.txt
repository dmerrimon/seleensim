   STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS)  
Title:  BHV3000-301: Phase 3 : Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, 
Safety and Efficacy, Trial of BHV -3000 (rimegepant) for the Acute 
Treatment of Migraine  
Rationale:          Rimegepant  is being developed for the treatment of migraine, with a 
specific focus on acute treatment. Effectiveness against migraine was 
demonstrated in a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose- ranging  study where rimegepant at 75 mg showed 
efficacy on all four traditional endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and 
phonophobia. 
The data from this study will allow characterization of the relative safety, and efficacy of tablets of rimegepant  versus placebo in the treatment of 
moderate or severe migraine measuring freedom from pain  and freedom 
from most bothersome symptom (nausea, photophobia or phonophobia) 
reported at the onset of the treated migraine. Information regarding time to onset of action, the duration of action, and the sustainability of pain 
freedom in patients with an acute migraine will also be obtained.  
Target 
Population: The study will recruit male and female patients [ADDRESS_1020143] a one -year history of migraines (with o r without aura), 
consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification  of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd edition beta version[ 1], including an age of onset 
prior to 50, migrai ne attacks that last about [ADDRESS_1020144] 3 months 
and not less than 2 attacks per month.  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 1415 patients will be screened to randomize 1200 patients 
(approximately 600 per arm).   If, however, the targeted  number of treated 
subjects  (see Section 9.2 Sample Size)  is reached  first, the study may be 
closed.  The subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  to the rimegepant or 
placebo treatment groups. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_745986]  (yes or no) . 
Objectives:  This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, outpatient evaluation of 
the safety and efficacy of rimegepant  as compared to placebo in the 
treatment of moderate or severe migraine. The study drug will be

   rimegepant presented in a 75 mg tablet  or matching placebo.  
The study will randomize approximately 1200 patients. The subjects  will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant or placebo treatment 
groups. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_634638] (yes or no). 
A patient whose usual migraine attack results in headache pain of 
moderate or severe intensity and who is otherwise found acceptable for 
entry into this trial based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will first 
participate in the screening phase (3 - 28 day period). Patients on 
prophylactic migraine medication are permitted to remain on therapy provided they have been on a stable dose for at least 3 months prior to study entry.  
After randomization, the patient will be dispensed a single dose of the 
double- blind study medication that will be taken at the time a migraine 
attack reaches moderate or  severe pain intensity (described below) on the 
numeric rating scale (NRS) as indicated in the electronic diary  (eDiary) . 
The patient will be instructed to take the ir study medication, as an 
outpatient, when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe pain intensity and only after they have identified their 
most bothersome migraine -associated symptom (phonophobia, 
photophobia or nausea). The patient will complete an e Diary for up to 
forty -eight hours after taking study medication. The patient will telephone 
the study center immediately if a severe or serious adverse event occurs.  
Patients will record efficacy data in their e Diary . This includes the 
following: onset time of headache, intensity of the headache prior to and at time of taking study medication. The patient should record all headache intensity leading up to dosing, but should not dose with study medication until the headache reaches moderate or severe pain intensity. Headache 
severity will be recorded using a four-point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain) at the onset of the migraine and after dosing at time points of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours. The presence or absence of associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) and ratings of functional disability (four-point scale: normal, mildly impaired, severely impaired, requires bedrest) will be recorded at the same time points as the headache severity 
ratings.  Patients will also complete the migraine -specific quality -of-life

   questionnaire and preference of medication (PoM)  scale  [ADDRESS_1020145] achieved 
pain relief . The patient who does not experience relief of their migraine 
headache at the end of two hours after dosing with study medication (and 
after the two hour assessments  have been completed on the eDiary)  will be 
permitted to use the following rescue medication: aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], ibuprofen, 
acetaminophen (up to 1000 mgs/day) naproxen (or any other type of 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID)), antiemetics (e.g., metoclopramide or promethazine), or baclofen. These are the only medications allowed for rescue treatment after [ADDRESS_1020146] dose of study medication. If at the end of 48-hours after dosing with study medication (but before the End of Treatment Visit) patients are in need of migraine relief, they may take their prescribed standard of care medications, including triptans if not contraindicated, provided all of the assessments have been completed on the eDiary . Exclusionary rescue medication such 
as opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], ergotamines, butalbital compounds, and muscle relaxants   (except baclofen as a rescue medication, see above ) are not 
allowed on this study. Similarly, if the migraine is relieved by [CONTACT_745987] 2 hours after dosing but then recurs to a moderate or severe intensity level between two and forty-eight hours, the patient will be 
permitted to take the same rescue therapy as outlined above. In all 
circumstances , the patient will always continue to complete his or her 
eDiary  for up to forty -eight hours after consuming the study medication.  
Patients will return to the study site within 7 days of study treatment for review of the eDiary , assessment of medication compliance, and 
monitoring of tolerability and safety (including vital signs, laboratory tests,  
and electrocardiography).  If a patient has  NOT  experienced  a  migraine  
headache of  sufficient severity within 45 days after randomization, he or 
she will be withdrawn from the trial and instructed to return the unused 
study medication and e Diary  to the study center.

   1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Therapeutic Area Background 
BHV -3000 (rimegepant, /rih- MEJ -eh-pant/) is a calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) 
receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. A comprehensive 
and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated in an 821 patient Phase 2b 
double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose- ranging trial where migraine 
sufferers received either placebo, sumatriptan (100 mg) or rimegepant  (10, 25, 75, 150, 
300 or 600 mg) (Study CN170003)[ 2]. A dose of 75 mg was selected as the optimal dose 
for Phase 3 clinical tri als, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and 
there was negligible benefit identified with higher doses. R imegepant  at 75 mg showed 
statistically significant comprehensive efficacy across all four traditional endpoints at 2 
hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable as evidenced by [CONTACT_745988] 24 hr and 48 hr 
showing significant difference from placebo on the corresponding 2-24 and 2-48 hr pain endpoints. 
1.2 CGRP’s Role in Migraine  
The CGRP receptor is located within pain -signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and 
mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. 
For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non- migraine sufferers, and treatment with anti- migraine drugs 
normalize CGRP levels. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in aborting migraine attacks.  
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the  
following possible mechanisms: 
• Blocking Neurogenic Inflammation:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to 
CGRP receptors located on mast cells would inhibit inflammation caused by [CONTACT_745989], or the meninges. 
• Decreasing Artery Dilation:  By [CONTACT_222440], CGRP receptor antagonists would inhibit the 
   
Study BHV3000 -301 Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 4.[ADDRESS_1020159] of active 
vasoconstriction. 
Inhibiting Pain Transmission:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP 
receptors would suppress the transmission of pain by [CONTACT_745990]

1.3.1  Non-clinical Pharmacology  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Pharm acokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics  
A series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism studies were 
conducted with rimegepant in rats, dogs, and monkeys. In addition, r imegepant was 
compared with two different triptans to assess potential to  contract coronary vessels.  
While sumatriptan and zolmitriptan exhibited progressive contraction of human coronary 
vessels at increasing concentrations, the CGRP receptor antagonist compounds leading up to identification of rimegepant did not induce any changes in the baseline tension in human coronary vessels even at very high (10 uM) concentrations.  Rimegepant was tested using the identical protocols in dog coronary artery (when viable human tissues were not available) and no vessel contraction was observed, in contrast to the triptans which again showed progressive concentration-dependent constriction. These data provide direct evidence that rimegepant acts without the undesirable effect of active vasoconstriction associated with treatment by ‘triptans’ . Please refer to the most current 
version of the Investigator Brochure for further details.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Nonclinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicity of rimegepant  was comprehensively evaluated in a series of 
single - and repeat -dose oral toxicity, genetic toxicity, phototoxicity, and safety

   [IP_ADDRESS]  RCT
 Dose -ranging trial of rimegepant for acute migraine 
(CN170003) 
Study CN170003 [ 3] was a double-blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, dose -ranging 
trial of rimegepant  for the acute treatment of migraine.  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placebo in the acute treatment of 
migraine as me asured by [CONTACT_222443] (head  pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at 
[ADDRESS_1020161]-dose using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying  an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant (10 mg, 25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg).  Randomization made use of an adaptive design, whereby [CONTACT_222444]- eighth were

   assigned sumatriptan; the remainder were assigned to one of six r imegepant  groups based 
on a Bayesian an alysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat 
one migraine of moderate or severe pain intensity and then return  to the clinic within [ADDRESS_1020162] and durabl e efficacy profile for rimegepant was demonstrated to be fully present 
at 75 mg [ 2].  This dose was selected  as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical 
trials, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and there was negligible 
benefit identified with larger doses , consistent with previous ly published migraine studies 
characterizing the dose- response profiles of acute treatments for migraine [8].   
Rimegepant  at 75 mg showed statistically significant efficacy (Figure 1 ) across all four 
traditional endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable and persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, patients who previously were experiencing moderate- to-severe migraine pain had no -pain 
(31.4% p < 0.0018) or mild- to-no-pain (72.1% = < 0.0007) as compared to placebo 
(15.2% and 51.2%, respectively).

In conclusion, Study CN170003[ 3] demonstrated that r imegepant  is superior to placebo 
in the acute treatment of migraines. The s election of 75 mg rimegepant as the Phase 3 
dose is based on reliably demonstrated efficacy on the key primary outcome measure, 
Pain Freedom at 2 hours (31.4% vs 15.3% placebo; p = 0.0018).

that inform PK, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy.  In total, the 
current data suggests a favorable benefit -risk profile for rimegepant  in the acute treatment 
of migraine attacks.  Efficacy was established in Study CN170003, and the overall 
database suggests a favorable safety profile. Clinical experience with rimegepant has also 
allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the intended therapeutic exposure and intended frequency of use. R imegepant  has been 
assessed in single doses up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600 mg with 14-days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded exposures more than 60 times greater in AUC and 30 times higher in Cmax as compared to the mean therapeutic exposure of a single 75 mg dose.  These high exposure multiples were generally well tolerated and safe.

1.4 Study Rationale  
Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder chara cterized by [CONTACT_745991] 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including typi[INVESTIGATOR_222428]-sided, pulsating 
headaches of moderate or severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Burden of Disease Study ranks migraine as the third most prevalent disease worldwide [ 9] and the Global 
Burden of Disease Survey [ADDRESS_1020166] approximately 15% of the adult 
population in the [LOCATION_002] [ 10], comprising approximately 33 million adults.  
Approximately 62% of migraineurs have one or more attack per month, and approximately 25% have one or more per week[ 11].  Approximately 80% of individuals 
are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with 53% report ing 
severe impairment and/or requiring bedrest [ 12, 13]. Comorbid conditions associated 
with migraine include depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease [ 14] .   
While there are multiple classes of medications for the acute treatment of migraine, considerable unmet need remains, as evidenced by [CONTACT_745992] [ 9].  In part, this burden is attributed to limitations of 
current standard -of-care pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which are contraindicated for use in over 2.6 
million Americ an migraine sufferers with known cardiovascular disease as well as many 
others with multiple cardiovascular (CV) risk factors.  The US Prescribing Information (USPI) for triptans includes warnings and precautions for migraine patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and states that high risk patients, including those with 
CCI
   
Study BHV3000 -301 Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 4.[ADDRESS_1020167], rimegepant, for the acute treatment of migraine that will address such cardiovascular limitations.  Clinical and nonclinical studies show that rimegepant is not associated with adverse vasoconstrictive properties that are thought to cause the serious cardiovascular adverse events of the triptan class and does not share a mechanism with other agents of cardiovascular concern such as non- steroidal anti- inflammatories (NSAIDs) and 
ergotamine derivatives.  A complet ed Phase 2 trial [3] demonstrated the efficacy of 
rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine, with and without aura, at doses of 75 mg and above.   Doses above 75 mg were not associated with clinically significant differences in efficacy and therefore 75 mg is the selected  dose for Phase 3.   
The randomized controlled study proposed herein will further assess the efficacy and  
safety of rimegepant (75 mg) for the acute treatment of migraine.  As such, this study serves the broader objectives of the rimegepant clinical develo pment program: to 
demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.  
1.4.1  Study Design Rationale  
This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, outpatient evaluation of the safet y and 
efficacy of rimegepant  as compared to placebo in the treatment of moderate or severe 
migraine. The study drug will be r imegepant  formulated  in a 75 mg tablet  or a matching 
placebo. The patient will be instructed to take their study medication, as an outpatient, 
when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe intensity.

   The study will randomize approximately 1200 patients. The subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to the rimegepant or placebo treatment groups. The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_745993]  (yes or no). 
This study design is utilized to confirm the efficacy and safety profiles observed in the 
Phase 2b study with rimegepant. Incorporation of placebo and use of appropriate rescue medications will permit enrollment of patients with a broad range of comorbidities, including cardiovascular conditions, representative of the potential treatment population. 
1.4.2  Dose Selection Rationale  
Study CN170003 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose- ranging trial 
of rimegepant  for the acute treatment of migraine  [2].  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placebo in the acute treatment of 
migraine as me asured by [CONTACT_222443] (head  pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at 
[ADDRESS_1020168]-dose using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying  an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant (10, 25, 75, 150, 300, or 600 mg).  Randomization made use of an adaptive design, whereby [CONTACT_222444]- eighth were assigned sumatriptan; the 
remainder were assigned to one of the six rimegepant  groups based on a Bayesian 
analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat one migraine of 
moderate or severe pain intensity and return to the clinic within 7 days.  
A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study.  Key entry criteria 
were very similar to those chosen for this clinical trial. 
A comprehensive and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated to be 
fully present at 75 mg but not at lower doses (i.e., 10 mg or 25 mg). This dose was 
selected as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical trials, given that larger doses (150 
mg, 300 mg, 600 mg) showed a similar efficacy profile and there was no pattern of added 
benefit in dosing higher, consistent with previous ly published migraine studi es [8].  
rimegepant  at [ADDRESS_1020169] efficacy across all four 
traditional endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable and persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, patients who previously were experiencing moderate- to-severe migraine pain had no -pain 
(31.4% p = 0.0018) or mild- to-no-pain (72.1%) as compared to placebo (15.3% and 
51.2%, respectively). For the 75 mg dose at 2 hr, patients also showed significant freedom from nausea (67.4%, p = 0.0074) freedom from phonophobia (52.3%, p = 0.0001) and freedom from photophobia (41.9%, p = 0.0023) vs. placebo (51.2%, 28.1%

   and 24.1%, respectively).  The lasting nature of these beneficial anti -migraine effects 
were evidenced by a comparatively similar efficacy profile in the 2 -24 hr measures, 
where rimegepant  at 75 mg produced significant 2-24 hr sustained pain freedom (27.9%, 
p < 0.0001) and 2-24 hr sustained pain relief (69.8%, p < 0.0001) vs. placebo (7.4% and 
42.4%, respectively).   
1.4.3  Other Rationale related to the compound/study  
Prior to initiation of Phase 3, a Phase 1 crossover study to assess the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of the rimegepant  tablet  in healthy  volunteers will 
be conducted to ensure PK comparability  with the previously studied capsule ( rimegepant   
free-base). The Investigator Brochure will be updated to include these study results when 
available.  
1.5 Research Hypothesis  
Rimegepant  (75mg tablet ) will have effica cy superior to placebo in the treatment of acute 
migrain e with a favorable safety profile suitable for use by a broad patient population.

4.3.2  Acute  (Randomization)  Phase (45 days)  
If the patient mee ts all eligibility  criteria they will be randomized at the Baseline Visit via the 
IWRS  system. The patients will be provided with an e Diary . The study personnel will instruct 
the patient on the proper use of the eDiary  and ensure proper understanding and use of the tool, 
prior to the patient leaving the office.  
After randomization via the IWRS  syste m, the patient will be dispensed a single dose of the 
double- blind study medication  to take home for up to 45 days. This study medication  is to  be 
taken when  a migraine attack reaches moderate or severe intensity on the numeric rating scale 
(NRS) as indicated in the e Diary.  The patient will be instructed to take their study medication, 
as an outpatient, when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe 
intensity  after they answer eD iary questions about their current pain and symptoms  and 
identify their  currently most bothersome, migraine associated, symptom (phonophobia, 
photophobia or nausea) . The patient will complete an e Diary  for up to forty-eight hours after 
taking study medication. The patient will telephone the study center immediately if a sever e or 
serious adverse event occurs.  
 Patients will record efficacy data in their e Diary . This includes the following: onset time of 
headache, intensity of the headache prior to and at time of taking study medication. The patient should record all headache intensity leading up to dosing, but should not dose with study medication until the headache reaches moderate or severe intensity. Headache severity will be recorded using a four -point numeric rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe 
pain) at  the onset of the migraine and after dosing at time points of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 
minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours. The presence or absence of associated symptoms (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) and ratings of functional disability (four-point scale: normal, mildly impaired, severely impaired, requires bedrest) will be recorded at the same time points as the headache severity ratings.  Patients will also identify  their curren tly most 
bothersome symptom before taking study medication. Patients  will record the date and time 
study therapy was taken  in their e Diary . Patients will also complete the migraine -specific 
quality-of-life questionnaire (MQoL Q) and preference of medication (PoM) 24 hours after

regions, is defined as follows: 
A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. 
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local 
regulations. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investigational  
product is only dispensed to study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by [CONTACT_148624]. 
The rimegepant tablet and the matching placebo appear identical visually, via touch, 
smell and taste.

for any  other participant in the study. The physician/coordinator must contact [CONTACT_746005] a centralized database at the time of signing consent.  
After completion of all screening evaluatio ns all eligible subjects will be randomize d in a 
1:1 ratio to  the rimegepant or placebo treatment groups. The randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_746006]  (yes or no). 
Randomization schedules will be generated and kept by  [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a secure 
network folder with access limited to only unblinded team members.  Each subject who is 
qualified for treatment will be randomized via the I WRS randomization option. Patients 
will maintain their subject number assigned at screening throughout the trial. The IW RS 
will prov ide the double- blind treatment assignments.  
The randomization will trigger a bottle number for the randomized treatment type. The 
drug will be dispens ed at the time of randomization .  
7.2.2  Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration 
Study medication (one 75mg tablet ) will be in a bottle . There are no dose adjustments in 
this study and patients will receive one dose to treat  one  migra ine  headache  of  
moderate  or  severe  intensity  within  the  45  days  of randomization (Baseline Visit). 
Patients will be administered the study medication  at randomization (Baseline Visit) and 
will take the tablet  from the bottle  at the time of moderate or severe migr aine headache 
onset after answering  questions regarding their migraine symptoms on the eDiary.  The 
tablet  should swallowed with water . 
7.2.[ADDRESS_1020236] is critical to the patient’s management, the blind for that patient 
may be broken by [CONTACT_1963].  
Before breaking the blind of an individual patient’s treatment, the investigator should 
have determined that the information is necessary, i.e., that  it will alter the patient’s  
immediate management.   I n many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not 
investigational product related, the problem may be properly managed by [CONTACT_746007].

 7.4 Treatment Compliance  
Responsible study personnel will dispense the study drug.  Accountability and 
compliance verification should be documented in the patient’s  study records.   
Patients have to be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as di rected  
when a migraine occurs and reaches moderate or severe intensity.  If the patient does not have a migraine or take their study medication within 45 days of the Baseline Visit, they should return to the clinic for their End of Study Visit and return t heir study medication.  
7.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug  
If the study drug (those supplied by [CONTACT_121192]) are to be 
destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made fo r the disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been established 
according to the applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have been documented.  The unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_222465]’s designee unless this is against institutional policy .  
All unused and/or partially used study drug may be destroyed on site providing the site has an applicable s tandard operating procedure on file.

 8 ADVERSE EVENTS 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith the use of the investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a patient.  In order to prevent reporting bias, 
patients should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs. 
There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious 
Adverse Events (AEs).   
8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
8.1.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria  at any dose: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_061]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received 
rimegepant  
• Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not limited to) : 
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
o Potential drug-induced liver injury

 Definition of Terms  
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more severe form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310085] (e.g., elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222433] (but may 
be considered non- serious AEs):  
1. A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] <24 hours that does not result in an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life threatening);  
2. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent; 
3. Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure; 
4. Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routine colonoscopy); 
5. Admission encountered for anothe r life circumstance that carries no bearing  on health 
and requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care- giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family 
circumstances).  
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a sub stantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
8.1.2  Collection and Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be 
associated with protocol- specific procedures.   All SAEs must be collected that  occur 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.0  Page 62 of 81 
 
 AND 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and 
hyperbilir ubinemia, including but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic 
or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug (s) kn own to be hepatotoxic.  
If any potential DILI is identified and meets the criteria above, the Biohaven Medical Monitor (or designee) should immediately be contact[CONTACT_746009].  
8.[ADDRESS_1020237] abnormalities should be captured on the non-serious AE 
CRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:  
1. Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE;  
2. Any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to have the study drug discontinued or interrupted; 
3. Any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to receive specific corrective 
therapy.

 9 STATISTICS  
9.1 General Procedures  
Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are 
summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum 
and maximum).   
For the calculation of descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects mus t have a 
baseline value to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes from baseline 
over time.  
Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: protocol deviations; interruptions of study therapy; non-study medications; adverse events; and laboratory abnormalities. Thus, for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject. 
9.2 Sample Size  
If approximately 90% of the [ADDRESS_1020238] a 
migraine  in the allotted time period, there will be approximately 550 treated subjects per 
group.  
Based on approximations from the Phase IIb study, 550 subjects provides more than 95% 
power to detect a difference between rimegepant and placebo on the subject’s self-
reported most bothersome symptom. Also, based on the Phase IIb study, 550 subjects provides more than 95% power to detect a difference in freedom from pain at [ADDRESS_1020239] 95% power on each co- primary endpoint  provides at least 90% power to 
detect a difference on both endpoints jointly.  
9.3 Populations for Analysis  
• Enrolled subjects: Patients who sign an informed consent form and are assigned a 
subject identification number.  
• Randomized subjects: Enrolled subjects who receive a randomization treatment 
assignment from the IWRS ( rimegepant or placebo). 
• Treated subjects: Enrolled subjects who take study therapy ( rimegepant or placebo).  
• Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) subjects: randomized subjects that  take study 
therapy , have a migraine  of moderate or severe baseline intensity , and provide at least 
one evaluable, post- baseline, efficacy data point.

 9.4 Statistical Methods  
9.4.1  Primary Endpoint(s)  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant)  is tested for superiority to placebo, at an alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1020240] for pain is stratified by  [CONTACT_634653] (yes or no). The 
test for the most bothersome symptom is also stratified by [CONTACT_746010] (yes or no). These tests are conducted using the mITT subjects, with missing data at two hours imputed  to be failure ( i.e., Non -Completers = Failure;  NC=F). 
Sens itivity analyses  are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) .  
9.4.2  Secondary Endpoint(s)  
If the primary endpoint tests are both significant, then the secondary endpoints are 
evaluated  using a hierarchical gate- keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502], with each test in the hierarchy 
conducted at p=0.05.  These secondary endpoints will be tested in the following order: 
1. Photophobia freedom at 2 hours 
2. Phonophobia Freedom at 2 hours  
3. Pain Relief at  2 hours 
4. Nausea Freedom at 2 hours  
5. Probability of requiring rescue medication within 24 hours 
6. Sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours 
7. Sustained Pain Relief from 2 to 24 
8. Sustained Pain Freedom 2 to 48 hours 
9. Sustained Pain Relief from 2 to 48 hours 
10. Pain relapse from 2 to 48 hours 
11. Proportion of patients able to work or function normally at 2 hours. 
9.4.3  Analysis of Safety  
The investigators determine the intensity of AEs and the relationship of AEs to study therapy. The investigators’ terms are coded and grouped b y system organ class using the 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.[ADDRESS_1020241] version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) available. 
AEs are presented by [CONTACT_6657], ordered by [CONTACT_634654].  If a subject had an adverse event with different intensities over time, then only the greatest intensity is reported.  
AEs are tabulated in all treated subjects. SAEs occurring in subjects enrolled but not treated are listed. Deaths are listed for enrolled subjects without regard to onset.  
The frequencies of the following safety events are summarized by [CONTACT_71397], and overall, for treated subjects:  SAEs; all AEs, non- serious AEs, AEs by [CONTACT_2236];  and AEs 
by [CONTACT_182811] .. 
Graphical and tabular displays of liver function test results are provided.  
9.4.4  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics are made for: subjects randomized but not treated; subjects randomized and treated; and overall. A separate set of tabulations are made for subjects enrolled but not randomized.

 10 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES   
10.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and all applicable regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies. The study will also be conducted in compliance with the recommendations laid down in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with the exception that registration of such Phase [ADDRESS_1020243] /Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/ IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_114601].    
All serious breaches must be reported to Biohaven (or designee) immediately.  A Serious 
breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the stud or protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the patients of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to perform their respective task(s).  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been 
invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., lose of medical licensure, debarment).   
10.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will not make use of a Data Safety Monitoring Committee  (DMC).  The study 
medication rimegepant  has been found to be well tolerated  in previous clinical studies .  
Safety will be closely monitored via the sites and proced ures for unblinding in case s of 
emergency will be followed .  
10.[ADDRESS_1020244]/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure and any other written information provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the Investigators have obtained the IEC favorable written approvals for the above-mentioned study documents. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_746011] a ny study 
procedure. The original signed and dated ICF will be kept at the Investigator site and a copy will be given to the subject.  
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.[ADDRESS_1020245]’s further consent must be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_6179], prior to subsequently obtaining each subject’s consent.  
The Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendments (if any) before initiating the study.  
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs to regulatory authorities when necessary.  
10.[ADDRESS_1020246] ensure that patients, or, in those situations where consent cannot be 
given by [CONTACT_1962], their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully in formed 
about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
Biohaven (or designee) will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or 
Local) sample informed consen t form which will include all elements required by  
[CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.  The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Before the potential subject  has undergone any study- related screening procedures, the 
nature of the study and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are answered, but before proceeding further, the subject 
must read and sign a written informed consent form. This signed informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, revisions to the protocol and informed  
consent form will b e reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/ IEC, a  copy retained in the 
Study Master File, and the date and time the subject signed the form will be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a copy of his or her signed and dated informed consent form.   
If informed consent is initially given by a patient’s legal guardian or legally acceptable 
representative, and the patient subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating their informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the patient.  
The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its 
representatives and regulatory authorities may have direct access  to patient records.  
The rights, safety, and well-being of study patients are the most important considerations and should prevail  over interests of science and society.

 APPENDIX II – Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles  
for 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly 
Helsinki, Finland, June [ADDRESS_1020254] the health of the people. The physician’s knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with 
the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medica l Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest 
when providing medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject." 
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately mu st rest in part on 
experimentation involving human subjects. 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.[ADDRESS_1020255] be independent of the 
investigator, the Sponsor or any other kind of undue influence. This independent committee should be in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is performed. T he committee has the right to monitor ongoing 
trials. The researcher has the obligation to provide monitoring information to the committee, especially any SAEs. The researcher should also submit to the committee, for 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.[ADDRESS_1020256]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of 
the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of inte rest, institutional 
affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non- written consent must be formally 
documented and witnessed. 
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.[ADDRESS_1020257] obtain that assent in 
addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. 
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy 
or advance consent, should be done only if the physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surroga te. 
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED 
WITH MEDICAL CARE  
The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the research is justified by [CONTACT_54233], diagnostic or therapeutic valu e. 
When medical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the subjects who are research subjects.  
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
  
Study BHV3000 -301Clinical Protocol  Confidential  
BHV -3000 (rimegepant) / Version 3.[ADDRESS_1020258] be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic 
measures, if in the physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

40 Basal-bolus insulin therapy is recommended for patients with poorly controlled type 2 
41 diabetes and HbA1c >9%. However, basal-bolus insulin is labor intensive and associated with 
42 increased risk of hypoglycemia, glycemic variability, weight gain and poor compliance. Thus, 
43 there is a critical need for a simpler treatment regimen that could overcome these limitations. 
44 IDegLira, a fixed-ratio combination (FRC) therapy consisting of insulin degludec and liraglutide, 
45 is an attractive option for this population given its proven benefits on glycemic control, weight 
46 and compliance. Accordingly, we propose a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing 
47 IDegLira and basal-bolus insulin therapy in achieving glycemic control (efficacy end-point), while 
48 preventing hypoglycemia and reducing glycemic variability and weight gain (safety end-point) in 
49 patients with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c between ≥ 9-15%. This study aims to show that a 
50 simpler regimen using a novel FRC agent (IDegLira) can improve glycemic control, decrease 
51 hypoglycemia, reduce the burden of diabetes care, and improve satisfaction/adherence in 
52 patients with poorly controlled T2D with HbA1c between ≥ 9-15%. This open-label, treat-to- 
53 target, two-arm parallel, controlled trial will randomize (1:1 ratio) patients with T2D and HbA1c ≥ 
54 9%, treated with oral antidiabetic agents and/or basal insulin therapy (TDD ≤50 units), to 
55 lDegLira or basal-bolus insulin for 26 weeks. We will recruit a total of 150 patients from 
56 participating institutions. We anticipate recruiting 3-4 patients per week for a total recruitment 
57 period of approximately 12 months.

Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 359 BACKGROUND:
[ADDRESS_1019579] study in 
63 patients with type 2 diabetes, showed that intensive glycemic control can reduce the risk of 
64 microvascular complications1-3. Sustained hyperglycemia, also known as glucotoxicity, leads to 
65 progressive loss of beta-cell function and is considered a key pathophysiological process in the 
66 development of T2D4. Patients with severe hyperglycemia may respond poorly to oral anti- 
67 diabetic agents (OAD) alone initially and frequently require insulin to achieve glycemic targets 
685,6. Current guidelines recommend to initiate therapy with basal insulin and progressively step- 
69 up to basal-bolus insulin in patients with high HbA1c >9%, particularly if symptomatic or with 
[ADDRESS_1019580], 
75 simplified treatment plans may improve adherence, leading to glycemic targets 
76 achievement12,13,15. Thus, there is a critical need for simpler regimens that could overcome 
77 clinical inertia, improve patient adherence, and decrease glycemic variability in patients with 
78 poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. With the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we 
[ADDRESS_1019581] recognized that hypoglycemia and glycemic variability are common events in many 
80 patients, even in patients with well-controlled T2D16-20. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_745426] 
81 and safety of combination therapy with basal insulin and GLP1-RA -including fixed-ratio 
82 combination (FRC) agents 21,22; no previous studies have compared the efficacy and safety of 
[ADDRESS_1019582]-of-care with basal-bolus insulin 
84 regimen. Accordingly, this prospective randomized control trial will compare IDegLira to basal 
85 bolus insulin regimen in achieving glycemic control (efficacy end-point), while reducing 
86 hypoglycemia, glycemic variability and weight gain (safety end-point) in patients with 
87 uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c ≥9%.
88
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 489 SPECIFIC AIMS:
90 Specific Aim 1:
91 1. To determine whether treatment with IDegLira will result in similar improvement in 
92 glycemic control, as measured by [CONTACT_51971]1c (non-inferiority limit of 0.4%), 
93 compared to treatment with basal-bolus insulin regimen in patients with poorly 
94 controlled T2D (HbA1c ≥9-15%).
95 -Primary outcome: change in HbA1c from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment with 
96 IDegLira vs basal-bolus insulin (with metformin, unless contraindicated).
97 -Hypothesis: After 26 weeks of treatment, IDegLira will result in similar improvement in 
98 glycemic control compared to basal-bolus insulin therapy.
99 Specific Aim 2:
100 2.To determine whether treatment with IDegLira will result in lower rate of 
101 hypoglycemic events and less glycemic variability (superiority), as measured by 
102 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), compared to basal-bolus insulin in patients 
103 with T2D and HbA1c >9-15%.
104 -Patients with poorly controlled T2D randomized to IDegLira or basal-bolus (with 
105 metformin, unless contraindicated) will have a one-week blinded CGM study performed 
106 during follow-up visits at 1, 12, and 26 weeks as well as 8-point self-monitored blood 
107 glucose (SMBG). CGM will allow better detection of hypoglycemic events, particularly 
108 asymptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia. It will also provide critical information on 
109 time in glycemic range and glycemic variability.
110 -Hypothesis: IDegLira will result in less hypoglycemia and glycemic variability 
111 compared to basal-bolus insulin regimen.
112 Specific Aim 3 :
113 3.To determine whether treatment with IDegLira will result in improved patient 
114 satisfaction compared to treatment with basal-bolus in patients with T2D and high 
115 HbA1c (>9-15%).
116 -Patients with poorly controlled T2D randomized to IDegLira or Basal-Bolus will 
117 complete the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and Treatment-
[ADDRESS_1019583] measures for diabetes (TRIM-D) survey during follow-up visits.
119 -Hypothesis: Use of IDegLira is associated with higher patient satisfaction and 
120 adherence compared to a multiple-daily injection regimen with basal-bolus insulin.

150 In a recent multi-national study of insulin-naïve patients with T2D, treated with or without 
151 oral agents, showed that only ~40% of patients with HbA1c > 9% were started on basal insulin. 
152 Moreover, the study showed that only 20.9% of such patients achieved HgA1c target (< 7%) at 3 
153 months after initiating basal insulin, indicating a need for coverage of prandial-related 
154 hyperglycemic excursions. Notably, failure to achieve HbA1c targets at 3 months was associated 
155 with an increased risk of not achieving HbA1c targets at 24 months, with < 30% of patients 
156 achieving glycemic targets28. This study suggests that providers delayed initiation of basal insulin 
157 as recommended by [CONTACT_145496], and frequently failed to intensify therapy to cover 
158 prandial-related hyperglycemic excursions. A recent study in ambulatory patients with T2D and 
159 high HbA1c (>10%) on metformin and sulfonylurea treatment, randomized patients to 
160 combination (COMB) therapy with exenatide plus pi[INVESTIGATOR_745428]-bolus insulin regimen. 
161 COMB provided greater HbA1c reduction at 6 months, with significantly less weight gain. 
162 However, the rates of hypoglycemia were unusually high, up to 56% and 83% in COMB and BB, 
163 respectively26. Our group recently validated the efficacy of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745429] 
164 on the admission HbA1c27. Among those patients with high admission HbA1c> 9% (n: 81), 54 
165 were discharged on basal-bolus insulin regimen. Mean admission HbA1c of 11.1% decreased to 
166 8.8% and to 8.0% after 4 and 12 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (p<0.01), respectively. However, up 
167 to 44% of patients had hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dl) during follow-up. Thus, there is a critical 
168 need for effective but safe and simpler anti-diabetic regimen for this high-risk population.

171 “Standards-of-Care” for Patients with Severe Hyperglycemia
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 6172 Based on expert consensus, the American Diabetes Association recommends “dual 
173 therapy” for patients with HbA1c >9% to achieve glycemic targets faster than with “sequential 
174 therapy” after 3 months of not achieving such targets. Based on historical availability and with 
175 no hierarchical preference by [CONTACT_30158], dual therapy includes metformin and any of the following 
176 agents: sulfonylureas (SU), thiazolidinedione (TZD), glinides (GLN) dipeptidyl peptidase-4 
177 inhibitors (DPP-4), SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and basal insulin8. Similarly, the American 
178 Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) based on expert consensus recommends the 
179 addition of insulin in patients with HbA1c >9% if symptomatic, or on maximum doses of dual 
180 therapy6. Moreover, in patients with HbA1c >8% on dual therapy and/or long history of diabetes, 
[ADDRESS_1019587] agent6. It was also suggested that the addition of GLP-1 to dual oral therapy may 
183 similarly help achieving glycemic targets6, but still many patients will require insulin in this 
184 scenario29,30. In patients with HbA1c > 10%, or blood glucose > 300 mg/dl, and/or symptomatic 
185 hyperglycemia (polyuria or polydipsia) and catabolic symptoms (ketosis and weight loss), the 
186 ADA recommends “combination insulin injectable therapy”. This regimen includes: basal-bolus 
187 insulin or basal plus GLP1-RA or pre-mixed insulin8. Notably, recommendations from national 
188 guidelines in this area are mostly based on expert consensus and the notion that “dual injectable 
189 therapy” for patients with HbA1c >9% may achieve glycemic targets faster than with “sequential 
190 therapy” after re-evaluation every three months, rather than based on strong clinical trials 
[ADDRESS_1019588] studies excluding patients with HbA1c > 10%24-27.
193
194 In clinical practice, many patients with uncontrolled T2D and HbA1c > 9% are started on 
195 basal insulin, followed by [CONTACT_745442]-titration and addition of prandial insulin (basal bolus)–in 
196 concordance with national guidelines6,8. Intensive insulin therapy, by [CONTACT_745443] 
197 subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI), early in the 
[ADDRESS_1019589] found similar HbA1c 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. 7206 reduction30,34,35 accompanied by [CONTACT_745444]-bolus insulin 
207 regimen30,35. GLP1-RA therapy was also associated with better patient satisfaction and better 
208 quality of life34. Indeed, the combination of basal insulin and GLP1-RA is an attractive and 
209 simpler option for many patients with uncontrolled diabetes – ideally in a single daily injection 
[ADDRESS_1019590] therapy may preserve beta-cell function36. Based on data from meta-analysis and 
212 randomized studies34,35,37, some authors favor this combination over basal-bolus insulin in 
213 patients with uncontrolled T2D on basal insulin38,39.

215 Combination of basal insulin and GLP-1 agonists – fixed-ratio combination agents
[ADDRESS_1019591]-prandial glycemic excursions and complement 
219 basal-insulin therapy by [CONTACT_745445] a glucose-dependent 
220 manner, inhibiting glucagon secretion, slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety40. This 
221 combination has been shown to provide better glycemic control, less hypoglycemia, less weight 
222 gain, and reduce glycemic variability compared to basal bolus therapy or GLP1-RA 
223 alone21,22,41,42. IDegLira is a novel fixed-ratio combination of degludec 100 u/ml and liraglutide
224 3.6 mg in a pre-filled pen. IDegLira has been shown to improve glycemic control, with lower risk 
225 of hypoglycemia, less weight gain, and better patient satisfaction compared to basal-bolus or 
226 stepped-up basal therapy 43,44. Pharmacokinetics studies showed that IDegLira provided 
227 coverage over the 24-hours interval at steady levels43. In the recent DUAL V trial, IDegLira 
228 resulted in greater HbA1c reduction, weight loss and less hypoglycaemia, compared to up-
229 titration of insulin glargine in patients with T2D with HbA1c 7-10%45. More recently in the DUAL 
230 VII trial, patients with HgA1c 7-10% randomize to IDegLira had similar HbA1c reduction, but 
231 with an 89% reduction in the rate of severe or confirmed symptomatic hypoglycemia and weight 
[ADDRESS_1019592] compared the efficacy and safety of IDegLira in 
236 patients with high HbA1c >9-15%.

239 SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION:
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1019593] three innovative questions in patients with poorly controlled 
241 T2D and HbA1c >9%: 1) whether IDegLira, a novel FRC of degludec and liraglutide, results in 
242 similar glycemic control, 2) less hypoglycemia, less glycemic variability and less weight gain 
243 compared to a basal-bolus, and 3) whether IDegLira results in better patient satisfaction and 
[ADDRESS_1019594] the potential to reduce the 
250 burden of complications associated with T2D. In addition, we will perform professional/blinded 
[ADDRESS_1019595] asymptomatic/unrecognized and/or nocturnal hypoglycemia and assess glycemic 
253 variability17,47 compare to SMBG (standard-of-care). Since IDegLira therapy is expected to result 
254 in less clinical significant hypoglycemia (defined as interstitial glucose < 54 mg/dl), less 
255 nocturnal hypoglycemia and less glycemic variability (as measured by [CONTACT_213945], %CV or SD)

409IDegLira will be titrated by 2-step-dose increment (2 IU of degludec and 0.072 of liraglutide), 
410 to a maximum of 8 steps per week. 
411The maximum allowed dose of IDegLira 50 dose steps provide 50 U of degludec and 1.8mg 
412 of liraglutide.
413Titration will be performed twice weekly (every 3 to 4 days) based on the previous self-
414 monitored fasting (pre-breakfast) BG measurement (mean of 3 consecutive days). Patients 
415 will be provided with self-titration algorithms for insulin adjustments.
416Subjects not at goal (fasting or mean SMBG from 3 consecutive days > 300 mg/dl) requiring
417 > 50 dose steps of IDegLira, will be considered “treatment failures”. Degludec will be added 
418 to IDegLira as “rescue” basal insulin therapy. The dose of IDegLira will remain unchanged.
419The dose of “rescue” Degludec will be recorded and titrated twice weekly to target FPG of 
420 70-100 mg/dl, per provider discretion, as shown below.

551 Rationale for Study Population
552 The target population will include subjects with uncontrolled T2D with HbA1c ≥9%-15%, 
553 treated with oral anti-diabetic agents and low dose basal insulin (TDD ≤50 units/d), in whose 
[ADDRESS_1019610] 90 days (with stable doses of insulin, 10% of dose 
556 fluctuations are acceptable). These subjects need intensification of therapy, and should start 
557 basal insulin and progressively step-up to basal-bolus insulin per national guidelines. However, 
558 these patients may benefit more from a simpler regimen consisting of a single daily injection, 
559 with lower risk of hypoglycaemia and less weight gain, which could improve treatment 
560 adherence. IDegLira is an attractive therapeutic option for these patients for its potency, 
561 flexibility, and potential lower risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.
562
563 Visit Procedures
564 Figure 2 and Table 1 provides a description of procedures to be performed at each visit 
565 during the study period. Visits will be distributed as follows: initial/screening visit/CGM baseline 
566 insertion, (visit 1), 2 weeks of screening/run-in period, randomization visit (visit 2), 26-week 
567 treatment period (visits 4-18), and a follow-up safety visit after the end the 26- weeks treatment 
568 period (visit 19). Subjects will have contact [CONTACT_745450] 
569 contacts for a total of 9 clinic visits and 9 telephone contacts. If subjects cannot participate in a 
570 scheduled visit (+/- 3 days), the investigators will arrange for an urgent (as soon as possible) 
[ADDRESS_1019611] the following data (as described in Table 1): glycemic 
572 data, hypoglycemia events, drug compliance, protocol adherence, body measurements, and 
573 adverse events.

618 Approximately 2 weeks prior to starting study medications, all potential study subjects will be 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. [ZIP_CODE] screened to check their eligibility. After providing the subjects with detailed information about the 
620 trial, subjects will sign the informed consent form and will be assigned a patient identification 
621 number.
622 During this visit, investigators will perform a comprehensive assessment, including: 
[ADDRESS_1019618] medical history (concomitant illness), diabetes history (onset, prior 
624 complications, current and prior anti-diabetes medication’s duration, allergies, or intolerances), 
625 physical examination, height, weight, vital signs, laboratory assessment (HbA1c, chemistry,

816 Hypoglycemia. It is possible that following the proposed protocol, subjects receiving IDegLira 
817 or Basal-bolus may develop hypoglycemia, as defined above.
818 Gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea and vomiting are more common in patients 
819 treated with liraglutide compared to placebo. The frequency of nausea and vomiting is reported 
820 in up to 5-15% patients receiving IDegLira. The number of adverse events will be collected at 
[ADDRESS_1019634] been few reported events of acute 
822 pancreatitis. Subjects should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis: 
[ADDRESS_1019635] been conducted and appropriate treatment should be 
826 initiated. Subjects diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (as a minimum 2 of 3: characteristic 
827 abdominal pain, amylase and/or lipase >3xUNR or characteristic findings on CT scan/ MRI 
828 should be withdrawn from the study. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial (LEADER trial) 3.1% of 
829 patients treated with liraglutide, versus 1.9% of placebo treated patients reported an acute 
[ADDRESS_1019636] Risks:
835 We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor 
[ADDRESS_1019637] and every 1-2 months 
Version 3.2 10.12.21 Page. [ZIP_CODE] during clinic visits, b) women of reproductive age who are sexually active will undergo a urine 
838 pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study and in-person visits as deemed by [CONTACT_941] 
839 investigator, c) female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or not willing to use 
840 appropriate contraception at time of enrollment will not be included in the study, d) patients with 
841 significant comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease greater than stage III, liver cirrhosis, 
842 gastroparesis, and pancreatic disorders will be excluded from the study. Hypoglycemia: Patients 
843 will receive diabetes education and will be instructed on hypoglycemia sign/symptoms and 
844 treatment. Patients will be asked to call the diabetes center and/or PCP in the event of 
845 hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the dose of basal insulin will be reduced (see 
846 treatment algorithm). Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea and vomiting may be 
[ADDRESS_1019638] been conducted and appropriate treatment initiated.
850
851 Other Assessments
852 We will assess patient satisfaction by [CONTACT_745453]- 
853 of-study, as recommended by [CONTACT_745454].
854 For treatment satisfaction , subjects’ responses to questions 1, 7 and 8 of the DTSQc will be 
855 used. A comparison of the score on the DTSQs from week 0 to week 24, as well as using the 
856 score on the other questions of the DTSQc, which would overcome the ceiling limitation of using 
857 the DTSQs by [CONTACT_5071]49. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs) form 
858 will be administered at weeks 0, 12 and the DTSQc will be administered at week 26. The 
859 amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction, while the 
860 direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one treatment regimen 
861 over the other one.
862 For quality of life, we will use the “Treatment-related impact measures for diabetes” (TRIM-D)” 
[ADDRESS_1019639] will be asked.

872 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
[ADDRESS_1019640] deviation bounded above by 0.85 (%). We assume the 
878 margin of equivalence is 0.4 (%) and the true mean difference in the primary outcome is 0 (%). 
879 Given 57 subjects per study group, based on a one-sided, two-sample t-tests, we would achieve 
880 80% power to detect non-inferiority, with alpha (type-1 error) set as 0.05. Accounting for 20% 
881 attrition rate of 20%, we need to recruit 75 subjects per group (150 in total).
[ADDRESS_1019641] compare the primary outcome (i. e. 
885 change in HbA1c from baseline to after 26 weeks of treatment) between the two study groups 
[ADDRESS_1019642] variable selection and model checking procedures to decide 
889 the final model.
890 Secondary outcomes include various measurements (related to glycemic control, qualify 
891 of life, adverse effects, and etc.) collected at a single or multiple time points. For continuous 
892 outcomes measured a single time point (i.e. non-longitudinal outcome), we shall analyze them 
893 following the same strategy designed for the primary outcome. For discrete non-longitudinal 
894 outcome, we will use Chi-square (or Fisher’s Exact) tests to compare them between the two 
895 study groups. This will be followed by [CONTACT_745455] (or Negative Binomial) 
896 regression to assess other potential confounders.  We will perform appropriate model selection 
897 and diagnostic procedures to ensure adequate fit to the data. For outcomes measured at 
898 multiple time points (i.e. longitudinal outcome), we will first conduct cross-sectional analyses as 
[ADDRESS_1019643] correlations in the longitudinal outcomes. We will analyze 
901 longitudinal continuous outcomes based on repeated measures ANOVA followed by [CONTACT_491] 
902 measures linear regression, and we will analyze longitudinal discrete outcomes by [CONTACT_2329]
903 repeated measures generalized linear model (GLM). If the assumption of missing completely at 
904 random (MCAR) is reasonable, we shall handle missing data by [CONTACT_745456]- 
Version 3.[ADDRESS_1019644] statistical analyses using SAS 9.4.
908
909 Interim Analysis
910
911 We plan to perform interim analysis on the primary safety endpoint every 6 months. The 
912 trial will be stopped if there is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a difference in the rate of 
913 death (two-sided alpha level, <0.01) between the treatment groups. In addition, the trial will be 
914 stopped if the rate of severe hypoglycemic events (BG <40 mg/dl) in either group is > 40%.

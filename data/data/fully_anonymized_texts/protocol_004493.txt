Protocol Title:  Alvelestat ( MPH966) for the Treatment of AL pha-1 ANTitrypsin Deficiency (ATALANTa)  
 
Rationale :  
 Alpha- 1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and early -onset emphysema.  AATD is characterized by [CONTACT_438488]; leading to excessive 
neutrophil elastase (NE) mediated lung destruction.  Current treatment requires the periodic infusion of  pooled 
AAT derived from human plasma, but this therapeutic approach (termed augmentation)  does not definitively 
slow the rate of lung function decline  and is very expensive.   In addition, it is not clear that the currently 
recommended  dose for augmentation fully controls lung inflammation and destruction.   Alvelestat (MPH966, 
formerly AZD9668)  is a potent, s elective, and rev ersible, o ral inhibi tor of  human NE. Suppr ession of NE is 
expected to r educe lung damage and may slow dis ease progress ion. This stud y is to establish proof  of clinical 
conce pt by [CONTACT_438489] m echanistic effect and safety of alvelestat (MPH966)  in patients with AA TD.  
 Overall Design:  
 
This is a P hase 2, mu lticenter, doubl e-blind, randomized (1:1),  placebo-controll ed, [ADDRESS_555665] of oral admin istration of  alvelestat 
(MPH966)  in subjec ts wi th confi rmed AATD defined as Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi*null, or another rare 
phenotype/genotype known to be associated with either  low (serum AAT level <11 μM or <57.2 mg/dL) or 
functionally impaired AAT including “ F” or “I” mutations .

3.1. Background 
 
COPD affects nearly 24 million individuals and is the fourth leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002]1-4.  COPD 
is a heterogeneous disease characterized by [CONTACT_438490], excessive inflammation, and 
protease/anti -protease imbalance 5,6.  AATD is the most common genetic cause of COPD and emphysema, 
accounting for 1 -4% of cases of COPD in the [LOCATION_002] and affecting between 70,000- 100,[ADDRESS_555667] common variants conveying 
increased risk for COPD associated with AATD are the Pi*ZZ and Pi*(null)  (null) phenotypes, accounting for very 
low or absent AAT respectively.  In contrast to the general COPD population, individuals with AATD have early -
onset severe emphysema, a more rapid decline in lung function, and an increased risk for liver dysfunction 10.  
The disease often affects people in the fourth and fifth decades of life, leading to substantial loss of productivity and societal contributions
7.  Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_438450], inhaled 
corticosteroids, and intravenous AAT augmentation using pooled, human plasma derived AAT.  AAT 
augmentation is indicated for individuals with emphysema and AATD, including individuals with the Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, 
Pi*Z (null), or Pi*(null)  (null) mutations.  AAT augmentation has been shown to slow the loss of lung parenchyma 
as measured by [CONTACT_438491], but unfortunately does not definitively affect lung function decline, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], exacerbations, or surviv al
9,11.  Further, AAT augmentation is very expensive with direct annual costs 
exceeding $100,[ADDRESS_555668] that the cur rently recommended dose of augmentation does 
not adequately control NE activity, lung inflammation and consequent lung destruction pointing to the need for 
additional NE inhibition to improve outcomes12.    
 
The mechanisms by [CONTACT_438492] -antiprotease imbalance 7,8,13.  AAT is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily of proteins 
which play a role in inactivating NE and other proteases14,15.  AAT reacts with NE much more readily than other 
proteases, including proteinase 3 ( PR3), cathepsin G ( CatG ), and trypsin, and in the lung plays a major role in 
mitigating against NE -mediated elastolysis.  In AATD, individuals not only have quantitatively less AAT, but the 
enzyme is less effective in inhibiting NE16.  NE is a protease stored in the azurophilic  granules of neutrophils and 
causes more robust proteolysis and connective tissue degradation compared to other proteases, including C atG 
and PR3, contained in the same azurophilic granules 17.  Under normal c ircumstances, NE is regulated by [CONTACT_438493], 
however, in conditions like COPD, and in particular AATD, the extracellular free enzyme NE concentration 
exceeds the buffering capacity of AAT 7,15.  Thus, NE causes direct lung tissue destruct ion and initiates a cascade 
resulting in pulmonary inflammation, mucus overproduction, and further damage to lung tissue and extracellular 
matrix18,19.     
 
Elastin is responsible for the elasticity of the lungs and is the substrate for NE20-22.  Elastin is a highly insoluble 
protein formed by [CONTACT_12783] -linking tropoelastin with desmosine and isodesmosine (collectively referred to as DES).  
Elastin degradation generates several elastin fragments, including DES20.  As these molecules are found 
exclusively in mature elastin in humans, they are useful biomarkers for measuring lung elastin degradation and 
have been measured in lung tissue, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), ur ine, and blood in patients with 
AATD20,23 -25.  DES as well as other NE -specific markers of elastin or collagen turnover (EL -NE) are associated 
with CT emphysema, lung function, and with other markers of inflammation in COPD and in AATD 26-30.  Further,  
AAT augmentation therapy has been demonstrated to reduce DES levels, validating their use as a marker for target modulation in trials targeting NE 
31. 
 
MPH966 (previously named AZD9668)  is a potent, selective, and orally available neutrophil elastase (NE)  
inhibitor32,33.  It has been developed as treatment for pulmonary diseases characterized by [CONTACT_438494], including bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis (CF), and COPD33-38. In Phase [ADDRESS_555669] will examine the potential benefit of MPH966.  
 MPH966 has high binding affinity and potently inhibits NE activity with an IC
50 of 12 nM and K i of 9.4 nM for 
human NE32.  MPH966  abrogated acute lung injury in mice and rats and decreased pulmonary inflammation 
(neutrophils and IL- 1b) in smoking injury models32.  In chronic smoke exposure models in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], MPH966  
prevented airspace enlargement and alveolar remodeling.  In ex vivo  experiments, MPH966  inhibited zymosan -
stimulated NE activity in human blood, with an IC 95 at plasma concentrations of 300nM32.  A detailed descripti on 
of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of alvelestat (MPH966) is provided in the Investigator 
Brochure ( Version 12 ).  
 
To date, [ADDRESS_555670] been conducted using MPH966 in non -CF bronchiectasis, CF, bronchiolitis 
obliterans syndrome, and COPD.  Although none of these trials achieved their primary endpoint, significant 
improvements in FEV 1 were observed in non- CF bronchiectasis and improvement in inflammatory markers were  
observed in CF and in non- AATD related COPD.  These trials compared placebo to MPH966 60mg twice per 
day and plasma MPH966 levels averaged 200nM, suggesting the 60mg dose was at the lower end of the dose 
range to achieve adequate target engagement.  Thus,  a higher dose of MPH966 is needed to achieve the IC 95 
(plasma MPH966  concentration of >300nM). In all previous trials, MPH966 was well tolerated with no treatment 
emergent significant adverse events, ECG or vital sign changes, and no dose related liver function abnormalities 
were observed.  
   
The scientific premise that NE inhibition ameliorates ongoing elastolysis in AATD will be tested.  If MPH966  
blocks NE activity in the lungs of AATD patients with PI*ZZ, Pi*SZ, or PI*(Null)  (Null) phenotypes, we predi ct that 
it will provide the first disease -modifying treatment in AATD and provide a paradigm shifting oral therapeutic 
strategy.  This would transform the care of an orphan disease in a patient population with an unmet medical 
need.   The first stage in the development of alvelestat  (MPH966)  in AATD -related emphysema is this proof -of-
concept trial. The results of this study will determine progression to phase 3 clinical efficacy  studies.     
 
3.2. Study Rationale  
 
The aims of this study are to build on the previous alvelestat  (MPH966 ) clinical experience and to confirm 
mechanistic efficacy through elastase inhibition in the AATD population  and investigate the safety and tolerability 
of alvelestat  (MPH966)  in the target population. Clinical efficacy endpoint studies in AATD -related lung disease  
often  involve longer -term studies  and are therefore inappropriate for decision making at the early stages of 
clinical development. The availability of biomarkers of elastolysis , which have been investigated in AATD, 
correlate with lung damage,  and show treatment response over periods of 4 to 12 weeks  23,25,31, enables a study 
design to demonstrate mechanistic e ffects over an appropriate time  period for a proof -of-concept trial. Greater 
efficacy and clinical benefit is expected by [CONTACT_438495] -related lung disease, in which neutrophil 
elastase is considered the key pathogenic driver, and by [CONTACT_2329] a dose of alvelestat (MPH966) to maintain neutrophil elastase  inhibition throughout the 24- hour period.  
 
Biomarkers of inflammation and lung matrix breakdown will be used to provide evidence that the inhibitory effec t 
of alvelestat  (MPH966)  on neutrophil elastase may deliver potential clinical benefit demonstrated by [CONTACT_438496]. This potential will be tested in patients receiving 
augmentation, which is the standard of care in many countries, as well as in those not receiving augmentation. 
These efficacy data in combination with safety and tolerability will be used to make progression decisions on 
alvelestat  (MPH966 ) development in AATD .

(MPH966)  inhibition of human neutrophil elastase.   
 
The participants will be those patients with the AATD  at risk for emphysema (Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi*null, or another 
rare phenotype/genotype known to be associated with either  low (serum AAT level <11 μM or <57.2 mg/dL ) or 
functionally impaired AAT including “ F” or “I” mutations )  
 
Following a screening period of up to [ADDRESS_555672] of MPH966 on the primary endpoint (desmosine/isodesmosine) . 
 The study is divided into 3 phases:  a screening phase, treatment phase, and washout phase as detailed below:  
Figure 1: Study Schematic

5.2. Number of P articipant s 
 
A maximum of 66 participants will be randomi zed so that approximately 60 evaluable participants complete the 
study.   
 5.3. End of Study Definition  
 
The end of the study is def ined as the date of all data being entered into the study database and the database 
being locked and ready for analysis . 
 
5.4. Scientific Rationale for  Study Design   
 
The aims of this study are to build on the previous alvelestat  (MPH966 ) clinical experience and to confirm its 
mechanistic efficacy through elastase inhibition in the AATD population and to investigate the safety and 
tolerability of alvelestat  (MPH966)  in the target population.  
 
Clinical efficacy endpoint studies in AATD -related lung disease involve long- term treatment due to the slow rate 
of structural  lung and functional decline and are therefore inappropriate for decision making at the early stages 
of drug development. The availability of biomarkers of neutrophil elastase activity (such as

360), which have been investigated in AATD, correlate with lung damage 
and show treatment response over periods of [ADDRESS_555673] of alvelestat  (MPH966 ) on neutrophil 
elastase may deliver clinical benefit demonstrated by [CONTACT_438497]. These efficacy data , in combination with information about safety and tolerability , will be used to 
make progression decisions on further alvelestat  (MPH966)  development in AATD.  
 
5.5. Justification for Dose  
 
Single oral doses of alvelestat  (MPH966)  [ADDRESS_555674] been evaluated in healthy subjects. A lvelestat  
(MPH966)  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584] (median time to reach peak concentration 0.5 to 1.5 h), with a dose- proportional 
increase in systemic exposure.  Multiple dosing show s no clinically relevant  accumulation,  and t he PK profile was 
generally similar between healthy subjects  and patients  with lung disease . The PK data supported development  
of a model to simulate predict ed doses  and exposures for this study.  
 
Alvelestat  (MPH966)  demonstrate s dose- dependent inhibition of zymosan -stimulated neutrophil elastase activ ity 
in clinical studies36. Although at plasma alvelestat ( MPH966 ) concentrations  of >100 nM, neutrophil elastase 
inhibition was differentiated from that obs erved on placebo, plasma concentrations >300 nM, were required to 
give meaningful effects achieving a mean neutrophil elastase inhibition of 92%.  Through observed and modelled 
PK, 120 mg bid is anticipated to provide a sufficient range of plasma exposures to achieve neutrophil elastase  
inhibition  through PK levels  >[ADDRESS_555675] relationship of alvelestat  (MPH966)  
to be characteri zed.  
 
As summarized below, the preclinical toxicology studies provide adequate safety margins for progressing to the 120 mg bid dose for 12 weeks in this study. The clinical safety experience with alvelestat to date has shown no 
signals that prevent progression of the proposed dose. The potential concern around transaminase elevation is 
considered monitorable and reversible. The safety of patients will be managed through the exclusion and 
inclusion criteria and safety monitoring approach taking into account the preclinical tox icology data and clinical 
safety information.  
 
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 13 of 59 5.6. Preclinical Safety Studies 
 
The safety margins for alvelestat (MPH966) have been evaluated in preclinical toxicology studies  of up to [ADDRESS_555676] level ( NOAE L) was 370 mg/kg/day  (1 month gavage) and 500 mg/kg/day  (dietar y 
1 to 6 month studies). These were the highest doses studied , and no toxicity was observed.  
 
In dog, 1-, 3-, and 12- month  toxicology studies at doses of 1.2, 12,  and 122 mg/kg  showed limited effect at the 
intermediate and high doses, including small decreases in bod y weight, small increases in plasma creatinine 
and trigl ycerides , and minor effects on electrocardiogram ( ECG ) with a transient increase of the QTc by [CONTACT_438498]’s correction formula ( QTcV) (<10%). The NOAEL was considered to be 122 mg/kg. In telemetered dogs  
at doses of  50 mg/kg (corresponding to a peak plasma concentration of 39.9 µM) , a mean increase of 9% 
(individual increases of 8 % to 14%) in QTcV was seen.  
 In mice, alvelestat  (MPH966)  was well tolerated at doses up to 2000 mg/kg. Histopathology  indicated slight focal 
hepatic necrosis above control. Additional effects in liver included minor increase in glycogen vacuolation at 
2000 mg/kg , slight h ypertrophy in males at 1000 mg/kg , and increased incidence above control of inflammatory  
foci in females at 1000 mg/kg. A  recovery  group  indicated possible reversibilit y, although the interpretation was 
difficult due to the low -grade change . Overall, focal necrosis is regarded as a non -specific response in mice, with 
no signs of progression or persistence and the relevance for humans is likely  to be limited.  
 
Preclinical toxicology findings, with the exception of QTc change, would be expected to be driven by [CONTACT_438499] ( AUC) . Based on preclinical data, a human exposure limit corresponding to the AUC at the NOAEL 
(500 mg/kg) in the rat 6 -month  study (f ree AUC of 14.7 µM.h, corresponding to a total human AUC of 25.8 µM.h) 
is considered as acceptable in clinical studies. Significant ly higher exposure levels have been evaluated in dogs 
for 12 months without an y adverse effects.   
 
The 120 mg bid dose in man is predicted to give an AUC  of [ZIP_CODE] nM.h,  approximately 53.8 -fold lower than that 
at the NOAEL in the 12- month study in dogs and 21.5- fold lower than NOAEL in the 6 month study in rats. The 
AUC is predicted to be approximately 9- fold below the level where liver findings in mice (increase in background 
pathology of likely limited relevance to man) were seen.  
    An additional consideration when calculating the safety margins in man compared to toxicology studies is the 
differences in plasma  protein binding seen across the species. Alvelestat (MPH966) plasma protein binding is 
less in humans than the other species investigated.  For more detailed information on the toxicology and 
nonclinical safety studies conducted to date,  please refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
 
5.7. Clinical Safety Studies  
 
Clinical experience comes from [ADDRESS_555677] 1 dose of alvelestat  (MPH966) . The highest single dose that has been given is [ADDRESS_555678] repeat dose is 240  mg bid (for 6 months ). In clinical studies, [ADDRESS_555679] not revealed an y adverse effects  on blood pressure, ECG, 
hematology , or urinal ysis that could be linke d to any of the observations in toxicology studies. For clinical 
chemistr y, there has been 1 patient with bronchiectasis with an instance of transient raised transaminases and 
1 patient with cystic fibrosis with an increase in creatine kinase, alanine aminotransferase ( ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase ( AST), and lactate dehydrogenase. In the studies in COPD patients , there were [ADDRESS_555680] to ≥3 × upper limit of normal ( ULN)  across the studied doses 
(alvelestat  [MPH966]  5, 20 , and 60 mg bid). Although definit ive evidence of dose relationship was lacking, there 
was a suggestion of an increased incidence of liver transaminase elevations in patients on alvelestat  (MPH966)  
for which there were no definitive alternative explanations . The highest transaminase elevations occurred in the 
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555681] alvelestat  (MPH966)  dose (60 mg  bid). There have been no cases of Hy’s law related to alvelestat 
(MPH966) treatment  reported in any of the studies to date (including up to 240 mg bid). The liver abnormalities 
noted to date with alvelestat, including from study MPH966 -2-[ADDRESS_555682] been infrequent (only [ADDRESS_555683] been reported and no SAE/ AESI of liver abnormalities have been reported in study 
MPH966- 2-01) and rarely abov e 3x ULN. Furthermore, all abnormal liver changes that have been observed have 
been reversible either with or without study drug interruption.   
 
Alvelestat  (MPH966)  is currently being administered in [ADDRESS_555684] disease following allogenic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , doses of up to [ADDRESS_555685] received 240 mg bid dose for up to 6 months . One patient underwent dose reduction to 180 mg  
bid following a SAE of severe gastroenteritis and renal failure that was considered unrelated to alvelestat 
(MPH966). A second patient had elevation of transaminases with temporary treatment discontinuation on a dose 
of 60 mg bid. The event was considered related to alvelestat (MPH966) , and drug was restarted at the dose of 
60 mg bid at recovery f ollowing a 2 -week temporary discontinuation.  In an ongoing blinded study in AATD -related  
lung disease (MPH966- 2-01, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [ADDRESS_555686] been randomized to dat e to alvelestat (either 
120 mg bid, 240 mg bid) or placebo (1:1:1)  for [ADDRESS_555687] been identified.  
 
For more detailed information on clinical safety studies conducted to date , please see additional details below 
and also refer to the current  Investigator ’s Brochure.  
 
5.8. Benefit -Risk Assessment  
 
Patients with AATD -related lung disease present at a younger age and show more rapid progression that non -
AATD COPD.  The most common symptoms are shortness of breath, wheeze, chronic cough , and sputum 
production with a propensity for recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_438452].  Available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_438453]. None of these affect the progressive decline in lung function that may lead 
to severe structural damage, loss of lung function,  and the need for lung volume reduction or transplantation in 
a select group. Augmentation with AAT protein is used in severe cases, with some evidence for effect  on 
progression of lung damage. However , the costs of administration and the inconvenience for patients of a weekly 
intravenous therapy mean t here is a high unmet need for more effective and convenient therapy.   
 
Alvelestat  (MPH966) is  a potent, selective , and reversible inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase. E fficacy has 
been demonstrated in in vivo  models of lung inflammation and elastase -induced lung injury32. Across clinical 
studies in COPD, cystic fibrosis , and bronchiectasis , there has been some evidence for  effects on elastin 
breakdown, inflammatory biomarkers , and lung function. The extent of these effects was not consistent in all 
studies. This may be due to the heterogeneity of the pathogenesis and/or the doses used (maximum 60 mg bid) that would not be expected to adequately inhibit neutrophil elastase, allowing inflammatory “escape” . Greater 
efficacy and clinical benefit is expected by [CONTACT_438495] -related lung disease,  in which neutrophil 
elastase is considered the key pathogenic driver , and by [CONTACT_2329] a dose of alvelestat (MPH966) to maintain 
neutrophil elastase  inhibition throughout the 24- hour period.  
 
Alvelestat (MPH966) has been previously evaluated in clinical studies of up to 12 weeks in duration as a potential 
novel oral treatment to control the symptoms and exacerbations of COPD and reduce the progression and 
severity of the disease. Alvelestat (MPH966) has also been evaluated in studies in [ADDRESS_555688] diseases 
character ized by [CONTACT_238482]: bronchiectasis
[ADDRESS_555689] frequently reported AE in 8 of the 12 completed studies to date. In healthy volunteer 
studies, headache was reported more commonly in  the avelestat ( MPH966)  group than the placebo group. 
Headache was generally mild in intensity ( although [ADDRESS_555690] had severe headache),  and there was no evidence 
of a dose– related relationship. In studies wit h cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, headache was also generally 
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 15 of 59 reported more commonly in the alvelestat (MPH966) group compared to placebo. In the BREEZE 
(D0520C00012) and MISTRAL (D0520C00020) COPD studies, headache remained one  of the most common 
AEs reported and was the most commonly reported treatment -related AEs (3 patients in the alvelestat [ MPH966]  
60 mg group) in the MISTRAL study . Headache has also been the most frequently reported adverse event 
particularly in the [ADDRESS_555691] to ≥3 × ULN across the 
studied doses (alvelestat [ MPH966] ) 5, 20,  and 60 mg bid); there were no cases of Hy’s law during the treatment 
period. Although definitive evidence of dose relationship was lacking, there was a suggestion of an increased 
incidence of liver transaminase elevations in patients on alvelestat (MPH966) for which there were no definitive 
alternative explanations. The highest transaminase elevations occurred in the highest alvelestat (MPH966) dose (60 mg bid). Elevations in hepatic biochemistry ass essments (transaminases) observed in patients in the 
alvelestat (MPH966) studies were confounded by [CONTACT_438500], but an effect of 
alvelestat (MPH966) cannot be excluded at this time . A significant proportion (49 %) of adult patients with Pi*ZZ 
AATD  have been shown to have small increases in levels of ALT
[ADDRESS_555692] 
(AESI ). 
 
There were no other clinically relevant changes in clinical chemistry data in the completed studies with alvelestat 
(MPH966). There were also no clinically relevant changes in urinalysis were observed in the completed studies 
with alvelestat (MPH966). There were no changes in ECG or vital signs data that indicated a clear treatment 
effect of alvelestat (MPH966).  However , in light of the minor changes in QTc in the dog toxicology, exclusion  
criteria and regular ECG monitoring at the time of peak concentrations of study treatment  and discontinuation 
criteria will be applied in the study. Clinically significant changes in ECG are also included as an AESI.  
 
Mutations in ELAINE, the gene that encodes neutrophil elastase, are associated with cyclical neutropenia , 
severe congeni tal neutropenia, and susceptibility to  recurrent  infection. To date,  no increases in rate or severity 
of infection or  neutropenia have been reported with alvelestat. However, for this initial study in AATD , patients 
with neutropenia will be excluded, new onset of neutropenia will constitute a patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160],  and 
infections will be an AESI  to monitor the safety profile as higher doses are explored in a new population.  
 
There have been no liver abnormalities in the current study , and those noted to date with alvelestat in study 
MPH966- 2-01, also in alpha- [ADDRESS_555693] also been infrequent (only [ADDRESS_555694] been reported and no SAE/ AESI) and rarely above 3x ULN. Furthermore, all abnormal liver changes 
that have been observed have been reversible either with or without study drug interruption up to doses of 240 
mg bid for 12 weeks . 
 
At present, based on the cumulative review of the data and with no new safety issues seen in the ongoing studies 
with dosing up to 240 mg bid of alvelestat  (MPH966) , the safety profile of alvelestat  (MPH966 ) remains 
unchanged and the benefit -risk balance continues to support the clinical development of alvelestat (MPH966). 
The potential or theoretical safety concerns on liver function, QTc changes , and susceptibility to infection are 
manageable through exclusion criteria, monitoring, study treatment  discontinuation criteria , and independent 
safety review through the DSMB , as detail ed in Appendix 7.   
 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits  and risks and reasonably expected AEs  of 
alvelestat  (MPH966 ) may be found in the current version of the a lvelestat (MPH966) Investigator’s Brochure.

• If ALT or AST are between 1.5  to 3 × ULN, regular monitoring (every 2 weeks at a minimum) is required 
until event resolution and patient can continue on study treatment  during this period . 
 
• If ALT or AST are ≥3 × ULN, repeat the test within 48 to 72 hours and the study treatment  will be 
temporarily discontinued while  awaiting repeat tests results; if the repeat tests is again ≥3  × ULN or 
≥2 × pre-treatment level, testing needs to be repeated at least twice weekly until event resolution or a 
return to baseline value while the study treatment  is withheld .  
 
• If AST or ALT are ≥5x ULN, a repeat value should be obtained within [ADDRESS_555701] values is ≥[ADDRESS_555702], the drug should be discontinued and the patient followed until the 
laboratory values normalize or stabilize, in addition to initiating potential (Drug Induced Liver Injury) DILI 
evaluation.  
 Discontinue Alvelestat (MPH966) for the following hepatic adverse events:  
 
• Regardless of the magnitude of the transaminase elevation, if the bilirubin is  elevated (any level) in 
addition to the presence of signs and symptom(s) such as  rash, eosinophilia, nausea, vomiting, or right 
upper quadrant pain,  
 
• INR ≥1.5 and TB ≥2x ULN, irrespective of the magnitude of ALT or AST  elevation.   
 
• TB elevation ≥2x ULN, and ALP ≥2x ULN for cholestatic liver injury.  
 
For each scenario, initiate potential DILI evaluation for alternative etiologies and obtain a hepatology consult. Liver biopsy should be considered for DILI. The complete liver profile including PT/INR must be 
repeated within [ADDRESS_555703] abnorm al value is obtained. Follow the patient until laboratory 
parameters stabilize or normalize. Study medication can be restarted only if an alternative etiology is “definitively” identified and liver tests have returned to baseline.  Testing for alternative etiologies can 
include serology tests (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ), Epstein- Barr Virus 
(EBV) , Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) , varicella  zoster virus (VZV) , parvovirus, toxoplasmosis), imaging, and 
pathology assessments ( creatine phosphokinase, clotting)  as appropriate to the clinical situation.  
 
Clinically significant liver function abnormalities should be reported as an AE/AESI . 
  
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555704]  be discontinued,  the DCC and 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_125169],  and further steps discussed:  
 
• ALT/AST >5  × ULN on 2 consecutive tests  within 24 to 48 hours OR 
 
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN OR 
 
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN and  international normal ized ratio (INR) >1.5 OR  
 
• ALT or AST >3  × ULN the appearance of worsening fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain/tenderness, fever, rash,  or eosinophilia 
 
ECG  Abnormalities  
 
If a clinically significant finding is identified (including but not limited to changes from baseline in QTcF  after 
enrolment ), the Investigator  or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and 
if any change in participant management is needed. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must 
be documented. Any new clinically relevant findi ng shoul d be reported as an AE.  
 
When the following ECG change conditions are met, study treatment MUST  be discontinued,  the DCC and study 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_125169] , and further steps discussed:  
 
• Absolute QTcF >500 ms or >[ADDRESS_555705]  be discontinued if the following laboratory parameters criteria are met:  
 
• Absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/L on [ADDRESS_555706]  be discontinued if the following other criteria are met:  
 
• Significant safety issues (as judged by [CONTACT_67505]). This includes AEs considered unacceptable 
by [CONTACT_5363]/or the Investigator  
• Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to subject’s safety  
 
• Pregnancy as confirmed by [CONTACT_438502]  
 
• Withdrawal of informed consent  
 Participants  may volunt arily discontinue investigational treatment for any reason at any time. Participant  decision 
on discontinua tion of study treatment  does not imply an automatic withd rawal from the study.  
 
Refer to the Schedule of Activities ( SoA)  for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and 
follow- up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed .

A
fter a laboratory abnormality leading to a delay of dosing normali zes sufficiently, study treatment may resume 
at the discretion of the Site I nvestigator  in consultation with the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_81730]. Similarly, study treatment 
may resume after the medication leading to suspension of dosing is discontinued. A decision to discontinue 
study treatment  and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be conveyed to the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_438460]. The 
Investigator  may suspend study treatment at any time, without consultation with the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_438461]’s best interest. However, the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_438462]. 
8.
1.2. Re-challenge  
R
esumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation should always be discussed with the DCC and 
study PI . 
Re-challenge should be performed one time only  if the study medication was held due to AST or ALT ≥3x ULN. 
Re-challenge should only occur  after the ALT or AST return to pretreatment baseline value.  
In the specific case of liver tests meeting the study treatment dis continuation c riteria in Section 8.1, no re-
challenge is per mitted. 
8.
2. Discontinuation  From the Study  
The 
Investigator should consider the following when withdrawing a participant from the study:  
•A
 participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at
any time at the discretion of the Investigator  for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons.
•If
 the participant  withdraws consent  for disclos ure of future information, the DCC may retain and conti nue
t
o use any data collected before such the withdrawal of consent .
•I
f a participant  withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not
tested , and the Investigator  must document this in the site study records  and notify the DCC.
8.
3. Lost to Follow -up 
A par
ticipant  will be considered lost to follow- up if he /she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298].   
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555707] be taken if  a participant  fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_47995] m issed visit as soon as possible and 
counsel the participant  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain 
whether or not the participant  wishes to and/or should continue in the study.  
 
• In cases in which the participant  is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator  or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]  (where possible, 3 telephone calls and mail a certified 
letter to the participant ’s last known mailing address. These contact [CONTACT_62542] ’s file. 
 
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be consi dered to have withdrawn from the 
study with a primary reason of lost to f ollow- up.  
 
9. Study Assessments and Procedures  
 
• Study procedures and their timing are summar ized in the S OA.  
 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the S OA, is essential and 
required for study conduct.  
 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that  potential participant s meet all 
eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to record details of all participant s 
screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
 
• . 
 
• Sample handling: Routine bloodwork and laboratory measurements used for safety monitoring and 
eligibility assessment (CMP, coagulation measurements, CBC, pregnancy testing, etc. ) will be processed 
and measured using local laboratory.  Samples (blood, sputu m, BAL) used for PK or biomarker 
assessment will undergo initial processing at the local site but will be shipped to a central lab ([CONTACT_240617]) 
at UAB for curation and analysis.  The procedure is detailed in the MOP.  
 
• Repeat or unscheduled samples may be ta ken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples . 
 
• Biomarker  samples (blood, sputum , and BAL ) will be stored for up to [ADDRESS_555708] biochemical values (platelets, ALT, and AST) as a non- invasive 
test to assess fibrosis and enable exclusion of participants who may be at greater risk of liver AEs 
(https://www.mdcalc.com/fibrosis -4-fib-4-index -liver-fibrosis ). The following formula will be used:  
U
sing a cut -off value of 1.45, a FIB -4 score <1.[ADDRESS_555709] a negative predictive value of 90% 
for advanced fibrosis.  In contrast, a FIB -4 >3.[ADDRESS_555710] a 97% specificity and a positive predictive value of 
65% for advanced fibrosis42. FIB-4 index has been shown to be superior to other scoring systems for 
differentiating between advanced and mild fibrosis .

• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_438508] s and the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation are met.  
 
• The DCC, the NCATS Medical Monitor,  as well as Mereo  have  a legal responsibility to notify both the 
local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies  about the safety of a study treatment under 
clinical investigation.   
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) according to local regulatory requirements and will be  forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  
 
• An Investigator  who receives an Investigator  safety report describing an  SAE or other specific safety 
information ( e.g. summary or listing of SAE s) will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will 
notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements . 
 9.4.5.  Pregnancy 
 
• Details of all pregnancies in female participant s and female partners of male participant s will be collected 
after the start of study treatment and until 5 half -lives (4 days)  after the last dose.  
 • If a pregnancy is reported,  the Investigator  should inform  the DCC  within 24 hours of learning of the 
pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5. 
 • Abnormal pregnancy outcomes ( e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, 
ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
 
P rotocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555718]’s partner, 
study treatment  will be immediately discontinued. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, 
elective termination, normal birth , or congenital abnormality) must be followed and documented. A f ollow- up 
report should be sent with any new information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome of the birth.

9.7. P harmacodynamics  
Pharmacocodynamic markers form the primary, and some secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints in 
this study  and are covered in Sec tion 9.2.1. 
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 33 of 59 10. Statistical Considerations  
 
10.1.  Sample Size Determination   
 
Over the course of the study, approximately 60 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of 
the following:  120mg alvelestat ( MPH966) BID or placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_438511]/phenotype.   
 
The study will be powered for within- individual change in plasma desmosine/isodesmosine as the primary 
endpoint at Week 12 compared to baseline.  A sample size of 30 participants in the MPH966  treatment group 
will give us >90% power to detect a 15% mean de crease of plasma DES from baseline to 12 weeks follow -up in 
patients treated with MPH966 (within subject change) using a two- sided paired t -test at α=0.05. This 15% mean 
decrease has been observed in trials of standard dose augmentation versus placebo 31.  A recent study of double 
dose versus single dose augmentation revealed a within subject decrease in plasma DES from 0.42 +/ -0.03 
ng/ml to 0.38 +/ - 0.03 ng/ml  12. We will have 80% power to detect a comparable difference in DES in those who 
have alvelestat added to augmentation.   
 
For comparing the mean change in DES between the two gr oups (placebo vs. MPH966), and assuming that 
there is no placebo effect over [ADDRESS_555721] at α=0.05 with a sample size of 60 (30 
per group) reveals that we will have 82% power to detect a 15% difference in mean change in plasma D ES.  
 
Other secondary endpoints (BAL and sputum DES, other serum, sputum and BAL inflammatory markers, patient -
reported outcomes, and pulmonary function) will be examined within and between group with paired t -tests or 
mixed effect modeling as appropriate.    
 
We will also examine the association between DES at baseline and response to treatment as measured by 
[CONTACT_294484] (FEV1) over [ADDRESS_555722] 80% power to detect a 0.[ADDRESS_555723] deviation of DES is 0.10 and α=0.05.  
 
By [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a 10% attrition rate over 12 weeks, the required sample size is inflated to 66 (33 p er group) to 
achieve the estimated powers. If we observe attrition rate less than we expected, we will have more statistical power to detect the expected differences. As one interim analysis will be conducted only for safety concerns (see 
Data Safety and M onitoring Plan), no adjustments to the Type I error is considered for estimating statistical 
powers.  
 
10.2.  Populations for Analyses 
 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:

10.3.  Statistical Analyses  
 
The statistical analysis will be performed using SAS® version 9. 4 or higher. The main population for efficacy 
analysis will be the Full Analysis Set ; supportive analyses will also be performed using the Per -Protocol Set .  
 
Continuous data will be presented using descriptive summaries (e.g., mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
maximum, median, lower quartile,  and upper quartile) . Categorical variables will be presented by [CONTACT_438512] (%) frequency.   
Unless otherwise stated, baseline value for any variable will be the last value ta ken prior to the first dose of study 
medication.  
 
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical tests will be 2 -sided and conducted at the 5% level. All presented 
confidence intervals will be 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals . 
 
The Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP)  will be developed and final ized before database lock and will describe the 
selection of participants to be included in the analyses and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and 
spurious data. Below is a summary of planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.  
 
10.3.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
 
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  Within individual % change from baseline in plasma desmosine/isodesmosine levels at 12 
weeks will be calculated. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline plasma 
desmosine/isodesmosine levels as a covariate and treatment and sputum strata as factors 
will be used to generate least squared means and least squared mean differences between 
treatment groups.   
Secondary  The biomarker  correlation analysis will be done using stepwise approach:  
The parameters in BAL, sputum , and blood during treatment will be compared to the baseline 
values for active and placebo patients separately to evaluate natural variability of the 
markers.  
 
The time- matched biomarker values will be compared between placebo and active groups 
to assess the differences outside natural variability and time to significant change for the 
responsive biomarkers.  
 
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555727] -time curve will also be considered.  
 
Principal component multifactorial analysis and/or c luster analysis may be e mployed to 
simplify the comparison  and to explore the treatment effect . Decisions will be made on review 
of data and prior to database lock.  
 
Correlation of select biomarkers shown to be responsive to treatment with time -matched 
drug concentrations and PK parameters , if available , may be used to evaluate exposure-
response r elationship .   
Exploratory  Observed values and change from baseline in FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1/FVC ( total and percent 
predicted) and maximal mid- expi[INVESTIGATOR_438469]. Change from baseline at W eek [ADDRESS_555728] biomarkers shown to be responsive to treatment with time -matched 
drug concentrations and PK parameters , if available,  will be used to evalu ate exposure -
response relationship.  
 
 
 
10.3.2.  Safety Analyses  
 All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set .  
 
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  AEs will be coded using the Medical  Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
Summaries will be by [CONTACT_6657]. Treatment -emergent AEs 
are defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study medication. 
If a participant experiences the same preferred term multiple times , the event will be 
counted only once overall and by [CONTACT_107237].  
 
The frequency and incidence of treatment -emergent AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_438513] (number  and percentage of 
participants experiencing at least 1 AE per preferred term as well as the number of 
observed events per preferred term). Separate tables will be presented by [CONTACT_107239]. All AEs will be presented in full in a comprehens ive listing including participant 
number, treatment regimen, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, relationship to 
treatment, onset/stop , and duration. Details of SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal will be 
listed separately.  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AESIs,  including liver function abnormalities , ECG/cardiac  events , infections , and 
neutropenia , will be tabulated and summar ized by [CONTACT_6654] .  
Secondary  Vital Signs  
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555729] ID and body system.  
 ECG  
ECG parameters will be summar ized as observed values and change from baseline by 
[CONTACT_67486].  
 
Abnormal findings (“n ormal” , “abnormal, not clinically significant” , and “ abnormal, clinically 
significant”) will be summar ized by [CONTACT_438514] , and 
change from baseline will be summar ized by [CONTACT_265558].  
 
Clinical Laboratory  
Laboratory parameters will be summar ized as observed values and change from baseline 
by [CONTACT_67486].  
 
Values outside the normal range will be summar ized by [CONTACT_438515], and  change from baseline will be summar ized by [CONTACT_265558].  
 
Safety and  PK Relationships  
The safety correlation analysis with drug concentration may be done for the safety 
parameters shown to be sensitive to alvelestat exposure. The comparison of exposure will 
be done between groups with non -clinically significant changes and clinically significant 
changes in safety parameters using graphic and statistical methods where data allow.  
 
Exploratory  The details w ill be described in the SAP finalized before  database lock . 
  
10.3.3.  Other Analyses  
 PK, PD, and b iomarker exploratory analyses will be described in the SAP finalized before  database lock.  
 10.3.4.  Interim Analyses   
 
No interim analysis for efficacy is planned for this study .  An interim safety analysis will be conducted when [ADDRESS_555730] SS, Agusti AG, et al. Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of

The NIH, Mereo, UAB, the FDA, the IRB, or a designee may stop t he study or study site participation in the study 
for medical, safety, regulatory, administrative, or other reaso ns consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and 
GCP.  
 
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 50 of 59 Appendix 4:  Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating,  Follow -up, and 
Reporting  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments ( e.g., ECG , radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment  of the Investigator  (i.e., not 
related to progression of underlying disease) . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing  condition including either an increase in frequency 
and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been 
present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the cl inical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a 
concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional 
overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless 
of sequelae.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action”  per se will not be reported as an AE /SAE.  
Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy  will be reported as AE /SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE /SAE.   
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE D efinition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are 
associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_438531] ’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder 
being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the conditi on that leads to the procedure 
is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission 
to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre-existing  disease(s) or condition(s) present or detect ed at the start 
of the study that do not worsen.  
 
Unanticipated Problem  (UP) Definition  
• In general, an AE observed during the conduct of a study should be considered an Unanticipated Problem 
(UP) involving risk to human subjects, and reported to the IRB, only if it were unexpected, serious, and 
would have implications for the conduct of the study (e.g., requiring a significant, and usually safety -related, 
change in the protocol such as revising inc lusion/exclusion criteria or including a new monitoring 
requirement, informed consent, or investigator’s brochure).   
• An individual AE occurrence ordinarily does not meet these criteria because, as an isolated event, its 
implications for the study cannot be understood.   
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 51 of 59 • AEs listed in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) are not by [CONTACT_438532] a drug, and would not be considered unexpected and thus would not be unanticipated 
problems.  
• Possible exceptions would include situations in which the specificity or severity of the event is not consistent 
with the description in the investigator’s brochure, or it can be determined that the observed rate of 
occurrence for a serious, expected AE in the clinical trial represents a clinically important increase in the 
expected rate of occurrence  
 
Events Meeting  UP Definition  
• A single occurrence of a serious, unexpected event that is uncommon and strongly associated with drug 
exposure (such as angioe dema, agranulocytosis, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• A single occurrence, or more often a small number of occurrences, of a serious, unexpected event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but uncommon in the study population (e.g., tendon rupture, 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy).  
• Multiple occurrences of an AE that, based on an aggregate analysis, is determined to be an unanticipated 
problem. There should be a determination that the series of AEs represents a signal that the AEs were not just isolated occurrences and involve risk to human subjects (e.g., a comparison of rates across treatment 
groups reveals higher rate in the drug treatment arm versus a control).  
• 
An AE that is described or addressed in the investig ator’s brochure, protocol, or informed consent 
documents, but occurs at a specificity or severity that is inconsistent with prior observations. For example, 
if transaminase elevation is listed in the investigator’s brochure and hepatic necrosis is observed in study 
subjects, hepatic necrosis would be considered an unanticipated problem involving risk to human subjects.  
• A serious AE that is described or addressed in the investigator’s brochure, protocol, or informed consent documents, but for which the rate of occurrence in the study represents a clinically significant increase in 
the expected rate of occurrence (ordinarily, reporting would only be triggered if there were a credible 
baseline rate for comparison).  
• Any other AE or safety finding (e.g., based on animal or epi[INVESTIGATOR_46294]) that would cause the sponsor 
to modify the investigator’s brochure, study protocol, or informed consent documents, or would prompt 
other action by [CONTACT_357429].  
 
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met ( e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438478]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease).  
 
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  or; 
b. Is life -threatening  or; 
The term “life-threatening”  in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the participant  was at risk of 
death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it 
were more severe.  
c. Requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438479]; 
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438480] (usually involving at least an overnight 
stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate 
in the physician’s office or out patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438481] s. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438482], the event is serious.  When in doubt as 
to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]” occurred or was necessary, the A E should  be considered serious.  
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 52 of 59 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336805] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity  or; 
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrho ea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained 
ankle) that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  or; 
f. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whe ther SAE reporting is appropriate in 
other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438483].  These events should usually  be 
considered serious . 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
 
 
 
Recording AE s and SAE s 
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all documentation ( e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.  
• It is not  acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914] ’s medical records to the DCC  
in lieu of completion of the AESI /AE/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_438484] . In 
this case , all participant  identifiers, with the exception of the participant  number, will be blinded on the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_438485].  
• The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other 
clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented 
as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and 
assign it to one of the following categories:   
• Mild:  An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
• Moderate:  An event that causes  sufficiently discomfort and interfere s with normal everyday activities . 
• Severe:  An event that prevents normal everyday activities. A n AE that is assessed as severe shou ld not 
be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category util ized for rating the int ensity of an event; and both AE s 
and SAE s can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as “serious ” when it meets at least one  of the predefined outcomes as described in the 
definition of an SAE , NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 53 of 59 Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of 
each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility ” of a relationship convey s that there are facts , evidence,  and/or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease( s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as 
the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the Investigator ’s Brochure and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE,  the Investigator  must  document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the 
AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator  has minimal information to 
include in the initial report to.  However, it is very important that the Investigator  always make an 
assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the DCC.  
• The Investigator  may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and send an SAE 
follow- up report with the updated causality assessment . 
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• The Investigator  is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or 
evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_438533]/or causality of 
the AE or SAE as fully as possible.  This may include additiona l laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations , or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant  dies during participation in the study or during a recognized  follow- up period, the Investigator  
will provide the DCC with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the DCC within 24 hours of receipt of  the information.  
SAE Reporting to DCC  via eCRF 
• SAEs will be reported to the DCC via the eCRF.  
• Initial reporting can be updated when additional information is obtained but this should not delay 
submission.  
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
• An adverse reaction (AR) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a clinical research study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease, temporally associat ed with the participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered 
related to participation in the research.  
• An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed . 
• S[LOCATION_003]R events are AR events that fulfil criteria for seriousness (outlined in SAE above).  S[LOCATION_003]Rs should 
be reported to the DCC, NIH/NCATS, Mereo, and the FDA using the instructions listed fo r SAE reporting.  
 
 
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 54 of 59 Appendix  5:  Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy Information  
 
Alvelestat (MPH966) has a low genotoxic potential and reproductive toxicology studies have not demonstrated 
any effects in either the reproductive function or in embryo- fetal development. Therefore, the following 
precautions are required to protect women of childbearing potential and female partners of males in the study.  
 
Definitions  
Woman of Childb earing Potential  
 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently 
sterile. Permanent sterili zation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral 
oophorectomy.  
 Women in the following cate gories are not considered women of c hildbearing potential  
 
1. Premenopausal female with one of the following:  
a) Documented hysterectomy  
b) Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
c) Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant ’s medical records, medical 
examination, or medical history interview.  
 
2. Premenarchal  
 
3. Postmenopausal  female  
a) A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone level in the postmenopausal range may be us ed to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone  replacement therapy 
(HRT). However , in the absenc e of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle stimulating hormone 
measurement is insufficient.  
b) Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use [ADDRESS_555745] discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study 
enrolment . 
Contraception Guidance  
Male  participants  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to the 
following:   
1. Are abstinent from penile- vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent on a long-
term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent for duration of study and for [ADDRESS_555746] dose  
2. Female partner is using a highly effective contraceptive method   
3. Agree to use a male condom plus an additional method with a failure rate of <1% per year as described 
in the table below when having penile- vaginal intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential .   
4. Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile- vaginal 
intercourse or use a male condom during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_438486] [ADDRESS_555747] dose.  
 Protocol Version 1.4  
 
 Page 55 of 59  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent   
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctlya.  
 Combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulationb  
• Oral  
• Intravaginal  
• Transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb  
• Oral  
• Injectable  
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent   
• Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectom ized partner  
(A vasectom ized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential  and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, 
an additional highly effective method of contraception  should be used. )  
 Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment . The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the participant .)  
NOTES:  
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_347823]. Use should be 
consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participant s participating in 
clinical studies.  
b) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment , which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case,  [ADDRESS_555748] dose of stud y treatment. 
 Pregnancy testi ng will be p erformed wh enever a menstru al cycle is mis sed or when pre gnancy is 
otherwise suspected. 
 
Pregnancy testi ng, with a s ensitivity of 5 mIU/mL will be performed and assayed at the study site.   
 Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_555749]’s partner, study treatment  will be immediately discontinued.  
 
After obtaini ng the ne cessary signed ICF from the preg nant female p artner directly, the Investigator  will 
record pregnancy informa tion on the a ppropriate form and submit it to the DCC within 24 hours of  learning 
of the  partner’s pregnancy. 
 
Partner will also be foll owed to det ermine the ou tcome of the pre gnancy. Information on the status of the mot her 
and child will be fo rwarded to the DCC.  
 
Generally, follow- up will be no longer than 6 to 8 w eeks followin g the e stimated delivery date. Any termination 
of the p regnancy will be r eported rega rdless of f etal status (p resence or absence of anomalies) or indic ation 
for procedure. 
 
Female participants who become pregnant  
 Investigator will colle ct preg nancy information on any female participant who b ecomes preg nant whi le 
participating in t his study. 
 Information wil l be recorded on the appropriate form and submi tted to  the DCC within 24 hours of  learning of 
a participant 's pregnancy. 
 
Participant will be followe d to det ermine the out come of the p regnancy. The Investigator  will collect follow- up 
information on pa rticipant and neonate, which will be fo rwarded to the DCC . Generally, follow-up will not be 
required for longer  than [ADDRESS_555750] atus ( presence or a bsence of 
anomalies ) or ind ication for procedure. 
 
While pregnancy itself is not considere d to be a n AE or SAE, a ny pregnancy comp lication or elective 
termination of a preg nancy will be r eported as an AE or SAE.  
A spont aneous abortion is always consid ered to be  an SAE and will  be reported as such.  
 
Any SAE occurring as a result of a pos t-study pre gnancy that is consid ered reasonably related to the stu dy 
treatment by [CONTACT_438534] r eported to the DCC as described in App endix 4. While the Investigator  is 
not obl igated to act ively seek this information in former stu dy participants, he/ she m ay learn of an SAE through 
spont aneous r eporting. 
 
Any female participant who bec omes pre gnant while participating will be withdrawn from the study.

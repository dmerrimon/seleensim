 JHSPH IRB Research Plan for New Data Collection IRB Version:  02Dec2021  For new data collection, new data collection plus secondary data analysis, biospecimen repositories, and data coordinating center protocols. DO NOT DELETE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THIS TEMPLATE  PI [CONTACT_5627]:  Julia Wolfson  Study Title:  Development and pi[INVESTIGATOR_36734] a novel cooking skills intervention to prevent diabetes IRB No.:   IRB00018839  PI [INVESTIGATOR_16280]. / Date:  V2/ 01/05/2022  I. Aims of the Study:  Describe the aims/objectives of the research and/or the project’s research questions or hypotheses.  The Aim of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the DPP Cooks compared with the standard DPP. We will conduct a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_36735]-income adults. Data collection will occur at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome is weight loss. Secondary outcomes include: dietary intake and quality; cooking confidence, attitudes, behaviors, and class attendance. Post intervention, I will also conduct focus groups with two groups: 1) with participants to understand their intervention experiences, and 2) with providers to examine program implementation and satisfaction. II. Background and Rationale: Explain why this study is being done.  Summarize briefly what is already known about the issue and reference previously published research, if relevant. Incorporating targeted cooking skills interventions into behavioral weight loss programs to prevent type-[ADDRESS_36697] in a randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], a new cooking skills intervention to supplement the existing Diabetes Prevention Program while supporting the career development of a new investigator who aspi[INVESTIGATOR_36736] a research career focused on preventing diet related diseases. Findings from this study will examine the importance of cooking skills for improving dietary intake, weight loss, and diabetes indicators, and will evaluate potentially important modifications to the DPP. III. Study Design: A. Provide a BRIEF overview of your study design and methods.  The study design must relate to your stated aims/objectives.  DETAILS WILL BE REQUESTED LATER.  If your study also involves analysis of existing data, please complete Section XI, “Secondary Data Analysis of Existing Data” in the last part of this research plan.  If your study ONLY involves analysis of existing data, please use the research plan template for secondary data analysis (JHSPH IRB Research Plan for Secondary Data Analysis of Existing Data/Specimens).   This study is a randomized control pi[INVESTIGATOR_36737]. DPP is a [ADDRESS_36698] 6 months to help them maintain the behavioral changes (re: diet and physical activity) they made in the first six months. For this trial, up to 48 participants will be randomized  1:1 to participate in the 12 month DPP or the 12 month DPP plus an additional 6 cooking skills sessions (DPP Cooks) during the first 4 months of the DPP. The primary outcome, weightloss, is collected at weekly DPP sessions. The secondary outcomes will be collected via online surveys at baseline, 4 months and 12 months, and via the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) at baseline and 4 months.  B. Provide a sample size and a justification as to how you arrived at that number.  If you use screening procedures to arrive at a final sample, distinguish the screening sample size from the enrolled sample size; a table may be helpful.   For electronic survey studies involving online recruitment and survey completion: consider how you will set controls on how many people will join your study. The target sample size of 48 individuals, randomized 1:[ADDRESS_36699] the DPP Cooks with several cohorts to understand implementation and prepare for a larger, fully powered study in the future.   C.  Does your study meet the NIH definition of “clinical trial”: ““A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of those interventions on health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes”?  If yes, the study must be listed on clinicaltrials.gov, study personnel must complete GCP training, and federally funded studies must post consent forms on approved sites, like clinicaltrials.gov. Yes, this study meets the definition of a clinical trial. The study has been entered in clinicaltrials.gov, but has not been published yet. It will be published when the IRB is approved prior to beginning any research activities.   IV. Participants: Describe the study participants and the population from which they will be drawn.  Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If you plan to include children, note their ages and whether you will include children in foster care or who are wards of the State. Note if the participants are particularly vulnerable in terms of cognitive limitations, education, legal migration status, incarceration, poverty, or some combination of factors.   A. Inclusion Criteria:    Participants will be adults (18 years or older) in the Baltimore area who are eligible for participation in the DPP and who are able to participate in the DPP Cooks sessions located at the Under Armour House on [ADDRESS_36700]. We will not impose a geographic restriction on where potential participants live/work, but they must be able get to weekly DPP sessions held at that time and location.   In addition to the above, inclusion criteria include the following:  1. Eligible for DPP based on CDC guidelines 
Page 3 of 27  
 2. Possession of a smart phone with camera 3. Can commit to 12 month study participation  For reference, the CDC guidelines for DPP participation are:  o 18 years of older and not pregnant at the time of enrollment o BMI of 25 or higher AND o HbA1C: 5.7-6.4% OR fasting plasma glucose: 100-125mg/dL OR 2-hour plasma glucose (after a 75g glucose load): 140-199 mg/dL OR previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes, OR high-risk result (score of 5 or higher) on the prediabetes risk test     B. Exclusion Criteria:     Exclusion criteria include: 1. Current or prior diagnosis of type [ADDRESS_36701] diabetes, diet or weight loss 4. Currently pregnant         NOTE: If you are recruiting participants or receiving, accessing, or using data from a U.S. health care provider, HIPAA review is likely to be required.  If you plan to bring identifiable health information from a foreign country to a U.S. covered entity (e.g., lab at the Hopkins SOM), HIPAA may be triggered. Check “yes” to the HIPAA question in the PHIRST application.  V. Study Procedures:        In this section, provide details of your procedures, particularly as they relate to human subjects. If this is a        multi-center study, make the role of JHSPH clear. If you will collaborate with other institutions or           organizations, or plan to subcontract JHSPH responsibilities to others, make clear their responsibilities in       the Study Oversight section of this document. Be aware that all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_36738]-exempt        human subjects research must have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) , which is a promise to comply with       human subjects research regulations.    If the JHSPH will serve as data coordinating center, indicate in the sections below which procedures JHSPH will not be performing.  Additional information regarding data coordinating centers is requested in a later section.   If your study will develop in phases, address each item below by [CONTACT_16303]. A. Recruitment Process: 1. Describe how you will identify, approach, and inform potential participants about your study.  Include details about who will perform these activities and their qualifications.  Participants will be recruited through several approaches which we developed in collaboration with the JH Medicine Recruitment Innovation Unit (RIU):   1. Social Media: We will advertise the study on social media (advertisements and social media strategy are attached) using paid ads. Paid ads will be run on social media platforms for varying 
Page 4 of 27  
 lengths of time that target the participant population inviting them to learn more about the study opportunity.  2. Community Outreach: We will also recruit through community outreach. Study fliers (attached) will be left at local community centers, businesses, residences, and religion institutions. Study coordinators will also accompany Barbara Bates-Hopkins during the ICTR’s Day at the Market and offer study fliers to interested individuals. Those interested will be pre-screened. Study flyers will be left at local Housing Authority of Baltimore City community centers. Study coordinators will work with the Office of Resident Services at Housing Authority of Baltimore city to distribute fliers to residents in target areas and hold information sessions allowing residents the opportunity to learn about the project and be screened for enrollment. We will focus on Housing in the immediate areas around the Under Armour House including the Douglass Homes, Pleasant View Gardens, and Sommerset Homes. 3. Website Postings: A study advertisement will be posted to the JHU Announcements website to reach the student and faculty populations. Interest adults may email or call to be screened for eligibility.  4. Study Registry: When available (anticipated early 2022), we will post the study on the JHU Research Study registry with appropriate key words so that individuals who are interested in participating in research studies can find it and be pre-screened for eligibility. 5. Word of Mouth: Study fliers will be available at University of Maryland and some Johns Hopkins health care clinics and waiting rooms for self-referral by [CONTACT_36757]. Staff and providers will be informed about the study and will mention the study to patients as well. Interested patients can then contact [CONTACT_36758].  6. DPP Screening: When individuals are being screened for DPP eligibility (for example after being referred by [CONTACT_36759]) by [CONTACT_36760] (e.g. The Brancati Center, the University of Maryland), the DPP staff will inform them about the opportunity to participate in this study. If the person is eligible for DPP and is interested in participating in the study, they will be referred to the study staff who will give them more information, and if interested and if the time and location of the weekly classes works for them,, will screen for eligibility for the DPP Cooks.  Study staff who conduct recruitment, screening, enrollment and consent will be public health masters level or PhD level students or staff study coordinators who have been trained in the responsible and ethical conduct of research. All student study staff will be supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Julia Wolfson, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7966], an Assistant Professor in the Department of International Health at JHSPH. All staff will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wolfson and will be provided scripts and background information about the study.           2. Address any privacy issues associated with recruitment.  If recruitment itself may put potential participants at risk (if study topic is sensitive, or study population may be stigmatized), explain how you will minimize these risks.   The privacy risks associated with recruitment are minimal. Participants will be proactively contact[CONTACT_36761]. The DPP (and the DPP Cooks) do not put participants at risk of stigma or repercussions if it would become known that they were interested in participating in the study. 
Page [ADDRESS_36702], and not over email.          B. Consent Process:   1. Describe the following details about obtaining informed consent from study participants.  If a screening process precedes study enrollment, also describe the consent for screening.  a. Who will obtain informed consent, and their qualifications:    Study staff (student research assistants or a staff study coordinator) or the PI, [CONTACT_36809], will obtain informed consent. [CONTACT_36809] has a PhD in public health policy and [ADDRESS_36703] the appropriate PEERRS certifications.         b. How, where, and when the consent discussion(s) will occur:    Informed consent will be discussed during the initial recruitment/ enrollment conversation(s) over the phone. Study staff will describe the study and participants will have the opportunity ask any questions about the study and will provide oral consent at the time they enroll in the study. Written consent will not be sought because DPP meetings will continue to be virtual, and there will not be an opportunity to obtain informed consent without imposing an additional burden on the study participants.         c. The process for determining whether a potential participant meets eligibility criteria.  If you will collect personally identifiable information for screening purposes, collect only data needed for this purpose and explain what will happen to the data for individuals who are not eligible:  Eligibility for DPP will be assessed by [CONTACT_36762].  Eligibility for the DPP Cooks study will be assessed by [CONTACT_464]. Study participants will be recruited and screened for eligibility via 2 ways. 1: they can contact [CONTACT_36763], or 2: they will 
Page 6 of 27  
 learn about the study when they are screened for DPP eligibility (after being referred by [CONTACT_36764]). See the attached figure ‘Recruitment and screening diagram’ for more information on these [ADDRESS_36704] for years by [CONTACT_36765]. These procedures will be followed per usual for this study. DPP staff will determine whether the participant is eligible for the DPP based on medical chart review or based on telephone screening (self-report) per usual protocols and in compliance with CMS standards.  DPP eligibility criteria are the following:  § 18 years of older and not pregnant at the time of enrollment § BMI of 25 or higher AND § HbA1C: 5.7-6.4% OR fasting plasma glucose: 100-125mg/dL OR 2-hour plasma glucose (after a 75g glucose load): 140-199 mg/dL OR previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes, OR high-risk result (score of 5 or higher) on the prediabetes risk test  We will create a spreadsheet in which potential participants are all assigned a participant number and where the PII information will be stored. In all other study documents, the participant will be identified by [CONTACT_36766], not the PII. The spreadsheet linking PII to the participant number will be stored in a separate folder in OneDrive. When a participant is not eligible, or chooses not to enroll in the study, their PII will be deleted immediately.   Community recruitment procedure: When a potential participant expresses interest in the study, they will contact [CONTACT_3019] (contact [CONTACT_36767]). If via study website or social media ad, they will also have the ability to fill out a brief online form that will collect their name, email, and phone number so that we can contact [CONTACT_476]. Participants who express interest in the study will be screened for eligibility over the phone by [CONTACT_464]. First, we will confirm that they are over 18, are able to attend DPP meetings at the Under Armour house, have a mobile phone (iPhone or Android) that can take photographs, and that they are able to commit to the [ADDRESS_36705]. We will refer them to the DPP partner staff (e.g. Brancati Center or University of Maryland) for them to confirm eligibility using their usual procedures (see above). The DPP partner staff will then confirm with us via the OneDrive spreadsheet whether the potential participant is eligible (yes/no) per CDC guidelines to participate in the DPP. They will not share specifics about which eligibility criteria were met. We will then contact [CONTACT_36768] 7 of 27  
 upcoming study cohort that works for their schedule. We will again go over the study protocol with them and obtain oral informed consent.   DPP referral recruitment procedure: Potential participants who have already been determined to be DPP eligible by [CONTACT_36769]. DPP program staff can also share our contact [CONTACT_36770]. We will then reach out to them over phone, text, or email. When we get in touch with the potential participant study staff will screen them for eligibility over the phone. First, we will confirm that they are over 18, are able to attend DPP meetings at the Under Armour house, have a mobile phone (iPhone or Android) that can take photographs, and that they are able to commit to the [ADDRESS_36706] information for how to sign up.

         d. Whether you will obtain a signature [CONTACT_36805]:   We will obtain oral consent as we are enrolling participants over the phone, and may not have any in person interaction with the participants until DPP Cooks cooking sessions (or at all if DPP Cooks sessions are virtual due to COVID-19).         e. Whether you will obtain a legally authorized representative’s signature [CONTACT_16314]:    n/a       f. If children are included in the study, if and how you will obtain assent from them: n/a  g. If children are included in the study, how you will obtain permission for them to participate from their parent, legal guardian, or other legal authority (if child is in foster care or under government supervision).  If any of the children are “wards of the state”, additional regulatory requirements will apply:       n/a    h. If you are seeking a waiver of informed consent or assent, the justification for this request: n/a i. Whether you will include a witness to the consent process and why:      n/a    j. If the language is unwritten, explain how you will communicate accurate information to potential participants and whether you will use props or audio materials:       n/a   2. Identify the countries where the research will take place, and the languages that will be used for the consent process.   Country Consent Document(s) (Adult Consent, Parental Permission, Youth Assent, etc.) Languages [LOCATION_003] Adult Oral Consent English                                       C. Study Implementation:  1. Describe the procedures that participants will undergo.  If complex, insert a table below to help the reviewer navigate.   
Page [ADDRESS_36707] weekly group meetings with a trained coach and other participants (usually between 8-12 people in a cohort). Participants receive coaching and social support around topi[INVESTIGATOR_36739]. Participants receive written materials to support their behavior change. They report current weight and minutes of physical activity at every DPP session which is recorded by [CONTACT_36771].   DPP sessions will take place virtually over Zoom.   In the DPP Cooks group, participants will also receive [ADDRESS_36708] virtually over Zoom. The professional chef-instructor has experience leading virtual classes since classes pi[INVESTIGATOR_36740] 2020. If cooking sessions are virtual, we will deliver food and equipment needed for each session to the participant’s home or arrange a pi[INVESTIGATOR_36741] (study staff will prepare bags of food for pi[INVESTIGATOR_36742]-arranged time for participants to come pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049]). Study staff will not enter the home, but will deliver it to the participant’s doorstep and will remain outside (and masked) to ensure it is received.   We begin this study with virtual DPP Cooks classes. We will not begin in person classes at the teaching kitchen until we have been approved by [CONTACT_36772].   The standard DPP group (control) will be offered a cooking skills session at the completion of the study as well as a participant workbook from the DPP Cooks.   All participants will have the following data collected: Measure Method Baseline 4 months 12 months Weight loss (kg and % of body weight) In DPP meetings X X X Diet quality (3 days at each timepoint) RFPM X X  Cooking skills/ attitudes/ behaviors Online Survey X X X Food Agency Online Survey X X X Cooking confidence Online Survey X X X Food security status Online Survey X X X Demographics Online Survey X   Acceptability of the DPP cooks Interview   X DPP session attendance DPP Coaches   X

        2. Describe the number and type of study visits and/or contacts between the study team and the participant, how long they will last, and where/how they will take place.   As described above, participants will participate in the DPP, which meets weekly for approximately [ADDRESS_36709] 6 months. Participants in the intervention arm (DPP Cooks) will have an additional 6 sessions in a teaching kitchen (2 hours each, 12 hours extra total). If the teaching kitchen is not open due to COVID-19 transmission rates, cooking classes will be held virtually over Zoom. If cooking sessions are virtual, study team staff will deliver the food and equipment needed to participant's homes. Study staff will maintain a safe distance when they deliver and will not enter participant's homes. Staff will drop off food and make sure it is received.   We begin this study with virtual DPP Cooks classes. We will not begin in person classes at the teaching kitchen until we have been approved by [CONTACT_36772].   The DPP Cooks arm will also be sent text messages during the latter 8 months of the intervention (after the 6 cooking sessions are complete) to act as cues to action to keep cooking and using the skills and recipes they developed.   Weight loss data will be collected per usual during DPP sessions by [CONTACT_36771]. During virtual DPP, weight has been self-reported by [CONTACT_36773]. Weight data is reviewed by [CONTACT_36774]. Weight data is collected in compliance with CMS standards. Weight data will be inputted by [CONTACT_36775] a spreadsheet saved on OneDrive. Participants will be identified by [CONTACT_36776].   Diet quality will be collected by [CONTACT_36777] a 3-day period and uploading those photographs to the SmartIntake app. Participants will be reminded to do this based on text messages from the study team, and the study team will be on hand to assist participants if they run into any problems or need help. Participants will be given a reference card to include in food photographs (e.g. a blank white care with some lines on it to help gage potion size as well as a paper food tracker and guidebook). Other measures of interest will be collected using online surveys (Qualtrics) at baseline, 4 months and 12 months. Finally, we will invite participants to share their thoughts and experiences with the DPP Cooks intervention in in-depth interviews (over Zoom or phone) at the end of the study (12 months).            3. Describe the expected duration of the study from the perspective of the individual participant and duration overall. The duration of the study is 12 months from start to finish. From the participant’s perspective they will attend DPP sessions and some participants will have [ADDRESS_36710] over zoom before baseline data collection begins.         
Page 11 of 27  
 4.   Provide a brief data analysis plan and a description of variables to be derived.  The key independent variable for all analyses is an indicator of whether or not the participant is in the control (standard DPP) group or the intervention (DPP Cooks) group. The other key variable is an indicator of time (baseline, 4 months, or 12 months). The primary outcome variables are weight loss (in kg lost, and in % of body weight lost). The secondary outcome variable is dietary intake/quality. We will use the data from the RFPM to calculate Healthy Eating Index-[ADDRESS_36711] analyses we will compare changes in scores from baseline to 4 months and baseline to 12 months between intervention and control groups.        5. Answer the following if they are relevant to your study design:  A. If the study has different arms, explain the process for assigning participants (intervention/control, case/control), including the sequence and timing of the assignment.  DPP cohorts will be the unit of randomization to avoid cross over due to the group meeting format of the DPP. Randomization will occur the same way for everyone regardless of how they are recruited. We will run 2 DPP cohorts concurrently and one will be the intervention arm, and one will be the control arm. Participants will be assigned to the two study arms randomly. Once participants enroll in the study, they will be assigned to the 2 study arms using a random number function in Excel. Because the intervention requires a weekly DPP meeting, and this needs to fit in to the participant’s life, we will create cohorts for randomization for whom 2 DPP meetings would be convenient. For example, if there is a DPP group on Thursday at 5:00 and another on Wednesday at 6:00 or 2 Thursday at 5:00 groups, we will create a spreadsheet of individuals for whom DPP meetings on Thursday at 5:00 or Wednesday at 6:00 will work. Then, we will use the random number function in Excel to assign those participants to 2 groups. We will also randomly determine which DPP cohort will be the intervention and which will be the control.         B. If human biospecimens (blood, urine, saliva, etc.) will be collected, provide details about who will collect the specimen, the volume (ml) and frequency of collection, how the specimen will be used, stored, identified, and disposed of when the study is over.  If specimens will be collected for use in future research (beyond this study), complete the “Biospecimen Repository” section below.  n/a       C. If genetic/genomic analyses are planned, address whether the data will be contributed to a GWAS or other large dataset.  Address returning unanticipated incidental genetic findings to study participants.    n/a     
Page 12 of 27  
 D. If clinical or laboratory work will be performed at JHU/JHH, provide the JH Biosafety Registration Number.  n/a        E. If you will perform investigational or standard diagnostic laboratory tests using human samples or data, clarify whether the tests are validated and/or the lab is certified (for example is CLIA certified in the U.S.).  For clinical tests of human biospecimens, no results may be returned unless completed in a certified lab. Explain the failure rate and under what  circumstances you will repeat a test.  For all human testing (biomedical, psychological, educational, etc.), clarify your plans for reporting test results to participants and/or to their families or clinicians.  Address returning unanticipated incidental findings to study participants.  n/a  F. If your study involves medical, pharmaceutical or other therapeutic intervention, provide the following information:  a. Will the study staff be blind to participant intervention status?   n/a b. Will participants receive standard care or have current therapy stopped? n/a c. Will you use a placebo or non-treatment group, and is that justifiable? n/a d. Explain when you may remove a participant from the study. n/a e. What happens to participants on a study in which there is a medical intervention when the study ends?  Will participants continue to have access to the study intervention?  What happens if they leave the study early?  n/a f. Describe the process for referring participants to care outside the study, if needed. n/a  VI.  Data Custody, Management, Security, and Confidentiality Protections:  Data security and management plans must meet institutional standards.  If you need assistance, contact [EMAIL_623]. Investigators are responsible for ensuring the security of data from the time of collection, through any transfers from one system to another, analysis, sharing, storage, and ultimate archiving and disposal.

We will retain all deidentified study data for at least [ADDRESS_36712] to support applications for future funding. Any identifiers will be deleted as described above.        A. Certificate of Confidentiality: All NIH studies include Certificate of Confidentiality  (C of C) protections with the grant; the consent form must include the C of C language provided in our template.  Other funders may obtain C of C protections through NIH.  (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/humansubjects/coc.htm  )   Does the study have Certificate of Confidentiality protections?  Yes ☒   No ☐  VII.  Risks of the Study: A. Describe the risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with the study and its procedures, including physical, psychological, emotional, social, legal, or economic risks, and the risk of a breach of confidentiality.  Include risks beyond individuals to include the study population as a group and community risks. Ensure that the risks described in the consent documents are consistent with the risks outlined in the research plan. The risks of harm or discomfort that may happen as a result of taking part in this study are not expected to be more than in daily life. It is possible that there is some risk of injury (minor cuts or burns) during the hands-on cooking classes. However, these risks are no greater than during regular 
Page [ADDRESS_36713] potential breach of confidentiality, all data will be immediately de-identified and only participant ID codes will be used on all quantitative and qualitative data. The spreadsheet linking participant ID codes to participant’s identifying information will be stored separately in the JHU OneDrive. No names or other identifying information will ever be used in any publication or dissemination materials. All study data will be stored on locked, password protected computers equipped with two- factor identification systems for the OneDrive. Risks of injury during the cooking classes is minimal, but study staff and the chef instructor will have first aid kits on hand to handle any minor cuts, burns or other injuries. In addition, kitchen safety and safe knife handling will be emphasized during the classes. To avoid food allergy events, prior to any food tasting or cooking activities we will ask participants about any known food allergies, and will clearly identify all ingredients in the recipes we prepare and taste.            C. Describe the anticipated frequency and severity of the harms associated with the risks identified above; for example, if you are performing “x” test/assessment, or dispensing “y” drug, how often do you expect an “anticipated” adverse reaction to occur in a study participant, and how severe do you expect that reaction to be?      We do not anticipate any of the risks involved would be greater than those expected during daily life.        D. Describe the research burden for participants, including time, inconvenience, invasion of privacy in the home, out of pocket costs, etc.     Participants will participate in the DPP (at least [ADDRESS_36714] 6 months) and in the DPP Cooks arm will also participate in [ADDRESS_36715] 4 months. Participants will answer surveys at 3 time point, will complete 3 days of dietary recall (by [CONTACT_36794][INVESTIGATOR_36745]) at [ADDRESS_36716] the option to participate in an in-depth interview after the completion of the program. In total, data collection activities should be a minor inconvenience and time commitment. Invasion of privacy is a very low risk and we do not anticipate any out of pocket costs.         E. Describe how participant privacy, and if relevant – family privacy - will be protected during data collection if sensitive questions are included in interviews, or if study visits occur in the home setting.     Sensitive questions are not included in any data collection documents and there are no in person or in home data collection activities.  
Page [ADDRESS_36717] Personal and Social Benefits: A. Describe any potential direct benefits the study offers to participants (“payment” for participation is not a direct personal benefit).  All participants will complete the DPP and will gain knowledge and social support to lose weight and improve their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_36746]-[ADDRESS_36718] pre-diabetes. Diabetes is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and disproportionately affects low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. Findings from this study may identify potentially important modifications to the DPP that could improve our ability to prevent type-2 diabetes. Procuring and preparing food is a daily occurrence and this study will provide new, detailed, and directly observed information that will inform not only the DPP Cooks intervention but that may be useful to create new or improve existing cooking interventions aims at building cooking skills necessary for consumption of a healthy diet. Overall, this study may produce new knowledge that will be important for improving diet quality and preventing diabetes and other diet related diseases.    IX.  Payment or Token of Appreciation:   A. Do you plan to provide a non-monetary token of appreciation (food, soap, tea, chlorine tablets, etc.) to study participants?  If no payment is provided, the JHSPH IRB strongly encourages providing such tokens. If yes, please describe below.   DPP Cooks participants will receive a Participant Workbook (attached) that will accompany and serve as a resource for the cooking classes. They will also receive food for the recipes that will be cooked at each class and will be able to take any left over food home with them. In the standard DPP arm, participants will also be offered the Participant Workbook and a cooking class (with accompanying food) at the conclusion of the 12 months. Participants who opt in will also be provided a CGM for 14 days at baseline and 12 months.   B. If you plan to provide a monetary payment, describe the form, amount, and schedule of payment to participants. Reimbursement for travel or other expenses is not “payment,” and if the study will reimburse, explain.    All participants will be compensated $100 ($20 after baseline data is completed, $20 after 4 month data collection is completed, and $60 after 12 month data collection is completed).      C. Include the possible total remuneration and any consequences for not completing all phases of the research.

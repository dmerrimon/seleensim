Lay Summary
1 * Provide a summary of the background and purpose of the study in language that can be understood b y a person without a
medical degree.  
Insomnia is a highly prevalent problem for V eterans with serious mental illness (SMI) that is linked to significant distress and poor functioning and is a critical obstacle to
rehabilitation and recovery (Cohrs, 2008; Kaplan & Harvey , 2013). The VHA has made treatment of insomnia a high priority and has initiated a nationwide dissemination
of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT -I)–an evidence-based practice and the first-line standard of care for insomnia treatment (Buysse, 2013). While CBT -I
is the gold-standard for insomnia treatment in the general population, only several small studies have evaluated the ef ficacy of CBT -I for V eterans with psychotic or
bipolar disorders.  
Although CBT -I has the potential to greatly benefit V eterans, practical and illness-related factors are challenges to using CBT -I with V eterans with SMI (i.e., psychotic and
bipolar disorders). Prior research shows that while CBT -I may be helpful for some people with psychotic or bipolar disorders, guidelines are needed to aid clinicians in the
clinical tailoring of CBT -I for this population (Dopke, Lehner , & W ells, 2004). Our research team has developed guidelines for clinicians to tailor CBT -I so that it meets the
unique needs of V eterans with SMI. Randomized controlled trials are now needed to assess the extent to which CBT -I is indeed ef ficacious in populations with SMI, when
compared with treatment they receive in usual care (a focus on health and wellness more broadly). The purpose of this study is to examine the acceptability and
preliminary ef ficacy of CBT -I when compared to an intervention focused on health and wellness.

Justification, Objective, & Resear ch Design
 
 If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectiv es of this research. State the h ypothesis to be tested:  
Aims/Objectives: The purpose of this study is twofold:  
(1) In Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial), we will establish the acceptability of CBT -I for V eterans with psychotic disorders and insomnia when delivered using guidelines
developed for its use. T o do this, we will complete an open trial of CBT -I with six V eterans with psychotic disorders and insomnia (including schizophrenia disorders and
bipolar and major depression with psychotic features). Acceptability will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_4317]’ satisfaction with CBT -I and its overall utility , via quantitative
assessments and qualitative interviews. Refinements to the guidelines will be made based on this information.  
(2) In Phase 2 (RCT), we will test the preliminary ef ficacy of CBT -I for V eterans with psychotic/bipolar disorders and insomnia when delivered using these refined
guidelines. T o do this, we will complete a small randomized controlled feasibility and preliminary ef ficacy trial comparing CBT -I (n=30) to a Health and W ellness control
intervention (n=30), evaluating sleep and functioning outcomes. Specifically , feasibility will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_72232], initial intervention
engagement, attendance at intervention sessions, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72191] . We hypothesize that compared to a general Health and W ellness Intervention, CBT -I will result in
significant a) decreases in insomnia symptoms and b) increases in functioning. Regarding exploratory aims, using data collected from the RCT , we will explore whether
baseline clinical and sleep characteristics, physical comorbidities, medications, and health behaviors (e.g., smoking, caf feine use) 1) moderate the impact of CBT -I on
insomnia and functioning or 2) change as a result of participation in CBT -I, and whether 3) insomnia symptoms mediate the ef fect of CBT -I on functioning. Lastly , we will
(4) preliminarily assess durability of ef fects of CBT -I on insomnia symptoms and functioning at a 3-month follow-up visit.  
 
2 * Discuss the research design including but not limited to such issues as: probabilit y of group assignment, potential for subject
to be r andomiz ed to placebo group , use of control subjects, etc.:  
Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial): This phase includes an open acceptability trial and V eteran qualitative interviews. There is no randomization or control group.  
Phase 2 (RCT): W e will implement an RCT of CBT -I with random assignment to: (1) CBT -I, or (2) Health and W ellness (comparison) group. Participants will complete
assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. W e will measure symptom and functional outcomes and evaluate potential mediators and moderators
of outcomes including cognitive ability , attitudes and beliefs, mental illness symptoms, physical health, and health behaviors. W e will also do V eteran qualitative
interviews to understand their experiences in the CBT -I treatment.
 
3 * Describe the relev ant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge. Describe an y relev ant preliminary data:  
We collected qualitative and quantitative data on sleep related problems, behaviors and treatments among 60 V eterans with serious mental illnesses, including psychotic
and bipolar disorders, receiving mental health clinic services at the V A Maryland Healthcare System, as well as providers. Of these, 73.7% reported symptoms of
insomnia rated as moderately severe or severe. V eterans in this study expressed dissatisfaction with medication due to side ef fects, and feelings of hopelessness that
medication is the “only way to get to sleep.” Desire for non-pharmacological alternatives to improve sleep was a common theme. Providers felt ill-equipped to of fer CBT -I
to Veterans with psychosis or those with a history of mania (e.g., bipolar disorder).  
In a non-V A sample of pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], we assessed 30 people with schizophrenia regarding problems related to sleep and the relationship between sleep and other health
behaviors. Many reported dif ficulty falling asleep at night (30%) or experiencing excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (17%), and it was alarming to find that 47% reported taking
medication to help with sleep at least three times per week. This figure, in a sample not selected for sleep problems, is highly suggestive that sleep is an important
problem for people with psychosis. Second, we examined relationships between insomnia and functioning in a sample of V eterans with SMI (e.g., severe depression,
bipolar , and psychotic disorders). These V eterans overwhelmingly reported significant sleep distress on the Insomnia Severity Index; 82% were dissatisfied or very
dissatisfied with their sleep, 65% reported worry about sleep problems, almost 40% reported that sleep problems were impairing quality of life, and most (64.8%)
considered sleep problems to be interfering with their functioning including concentration and ability to complete daily tasks.  
CBT-I addresses maladaptive cognitions about sleep, behaviors perpetuating poor sleep, and learned associations underlying conditioned arousal. Like non-SMI
samples, participants in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_72192]. Overall, our findings show that, for individuals with
psychotic and bipolar disorders, insomnia is an all too common problem. Importantly , our pi[INVESTIGATOR_72193] V eterans worry about sleep and the impact their poor
sleep will have on their ability to function in their lives and communities.  
Sleep Characteristics of V eterans with SMI have Informed Guidelines for Clinical T ailoring of CBT -I: There are a number of ways that CBT -I may not fully consider the
challenges experienced by V eterans with psychotic/bipolar disorders and insomnia. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_72194] a range of practical and motivational challenges,
including but not limited to cognitive impairment, motivational deficits, dealing with distress from delusions and hallucinations, medications that cause daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_72195], and needing structured daytime activities to stay awake during the day . Our guidelines for using CBT -I with this population address each of
these challenges. In addition, in pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we have asked V eterans with SMI and insomnia to review these guidelines. Our data reveal that V eterans with psychosis
and/or bipolar disorder and insomnia perceive these guidelines to be comprehensive in addressing their self-reported sleep challenges and that they would be willing to
try this treatment if these guidelines were used.  
Summary: These findings highlight the importance of addressing insomnia in V eterans with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder . Specifically: (1) Insomnia is highly
prevalent in V eterans with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder , (2) Poor sleep is related to impaired functioning in a number of important domains, (3) CBT -I is relevant to
Veterans with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder and insomnia, in that they experience many cognitive and behavioral challenges to sleep, (4) Guidelines for the clinical
tailoring of CBT -I for this population are necessary (5) Guidelines we have developed based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_72196], important, and likely useful by
[CONTACT_72233]/or bipolar disorder and insomnia, and (5) People with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder are willing and able to ef fectively engage in research
on sleep needs and health behavior interventions.  
 
4 * Provide the scientific or scholarly background, r ationale, and significance of the research and how it will add to existing
knowledge:  
Scientific/Scholarly Background: Among people with psychotic and/or bipolar disorder disorders, 30-80% report sleep disturbances (Cohrs, 2008; Klingaman et al.,
2015). Both objective (e.g., polysomnography , actigraphy) and subjective (e.g., self-report) data identify insomnia as a pervasive concern. People with psychosis and/or
bipolar disorder have less total sleep time, reduced sleep ef ficiency (sleep time divided by [CONTACT_72234]), and take longer to fall asleep compared to healthy controls and
30% to 44% meet criteria for moderate to severe insomnia. Insomnia is one of the most frequent reasons for mental health referrals in the VHA and insomnia is known to
cause considerable distress for V eterans.  
Given the detrimental impact of insomnia on symptoms and functioning among people with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder , an ef fective cognitive behavioral approach
for this group is desperately needed. Other evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72197] a range of symptoms and behavioral domains. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT -I), led by a trained
interventionist, is a well-established evidence-based practice, and is classified by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) as a first-line treatment for insomnia.
Unfortunately , there is little research examining the ef ficacy of CBT -I for individuals with SMI (e.g., psychosis and bipolar disorder) and therefore little information
available to practitioners wishing to use CBT -I with this group. There have been only three small non-controlled studies of CBT -I in people with psychotic disorders and/or
4/19/22, 1 1:30 AM HP-00074686
https://cicero.umaryland.edu/Cicero/app/portal/smartform/printProject/_IRB Protocol/5BD51FD98B12C742AE91A16CE1CA8CFC?packetIds=defaul … 14/87bipolar disorder . Authors of these studies stressed the need to attend to the symptoms and experiences of these individuals when administering CBT -I. All studies
simplified intervention materials and explanations. Neither team tailored the delivery of CBT -I in a standardized manner , to base changes on empi[INVESTIGATOR_33727], or to
document guidelines for clinicians using CBT -I with this population in the future. The authors noted comprehension dif ficulties for some participants suggesting the need
for more accommodation to cognitive deficits. They also noted need for building in more practice and motivational enhancement to help clients use behavioral strategies
consistently . In sum, while these trials provide preliminary support for the utility of CBT -I among people with SMI, each highlights the need for guidelines for the clinical
tailoring of CBT -I with this population.  
Rationale and Significance: V eterans with SMI are at elevated risk of disability , high health care spending, reduced quality of life, and early mortality . Thus there is an
urgent need to develop and test empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-derived guidelines for the clinical use of V A EBPs which would target functional outcomes for this population. Insomnia
treatment for V eterans with SMI is imperative in this regard. Insomnia is prevalent among people with SMI, causes them significant distress, and is associated with long-
term negative consequences for their physical, emotional, psychosocial, and cognitive recovery . It is also one of the most frequent reasons for mental health referrals in
the VHA. Further , insomnia represents a significant obstacle to the recovery of V eterans who have psychosis and/or bipolar disorders. CBT -I is classified by [CONTACT_72235] a
first-line treatment for insomnia, and the VHA is disseminating CBT -I as a national evidence-based practice for V A clinicians. Although CBT -I is the gold standard
treatment for insomnia, there has been little work to determine how to make it most ef fective and accessible for V eterans with SMI. The CBT -I manual specifically states
potential dif ficulties in using CBT -I with this population but provides very limited guidance on addressing them. As a result, during the V A Evidence-Based Psychotherapy
(EBP) consultation process, providers are currently routinely advised to avoid using CBT -I with V eterans with psychotic or manic symptoms. Thus it is likely that most
Veterans with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder , and insomnia are not of fered this evidence-based intervention. The VHA Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook
clearly states that V eterans with SMI must be of fered quality interventions comparable to the care received by [CONTACT_39785] V eterans.  
This project addresses this inequity through the testing and iterative refinement of guidelines for the use of CBT -I with this population, and evaluation of the ef ficacy of
this treatment. This can ultimately improve uptake within V A both by [CONTACT_72236] V A EBP trainers to recommend use of CBT -I with people with psychosis and/or bipolar
disorder , and by [CONTACT_7328] V A clinicians feel more prepared to use it. The coauthors of the V A CBT -I manual have agreed to use the resulting guidelines in future editions of
the V A CBT -I manual that is disseminated to all V A clinicians learning CBT -I, thereby [CONTACT_72237].

Veterans with SMI (i.e., psychosis and bipolar disorder) and insomnia have many sleep challenges. Even after adjusting for illness severity and medication side ef fects,
insomnia symptoms are strongly associated with many functional dif ficulties experienced by [CONTACT_72238]. Poor sleep quality predicts
dissatisfaction with social relationships, daily activities, emotional functioning, and quality of life (Hofstetter , Lysaker , & Mayeda, 2005; Klingaman, et. al, 2016). Chronic
insuf ficient sleep causes deficits in cognitive functioning generally (Basner , Rao, Goel, & Dinges, 2013), which are exacerbated among people with schizophrenia
(Basner , et al., 2013). Among people with other chronic medical and mental health conditions, randomized controlled trials (RCT s) demonstrate that successful insomnia
treatment can lead to significantly improved sleep; cognitive (Miro, et al., 201 1), social (T albot, et al., 2014), and daily functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and health-
related quality of life (Martinez, et al., 2013). People with psychosis and/or bipolar disorders also find improved psychotic symptoms and/or functioning with better sleep
(Kaplan & Harvey , 2013; Myers, Startup, & Freeman, 201 1; Dopke, Lehner , & W ells, 2004).  
Sedative-hypnotic and antipsychotic medications are typi[INVESTIGATOR_72198] (Kantrowitz, Citrome, & Javitt,
2009; Kaplan & Harvey , 2013). While FDA-approved, sedative-hypnotic medications are not fully ef fective at improving sleep, and dependence, withdrawal, and side-
effects are important risks (3). Psychotropic medications (e.g., quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) have limited ef ficacy and cause daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_72199] (Krystal, Goforth, & Roth, 2008). As such, pharmacological treatments alone fail to adequately address insomnia and its functional
consequences among people with SMI.  
Behavioral treatments have shown substantial ef fectiveness for insomnia while avoiding the above-mentioned adverse ef fects. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for
Insomnia (CBT -I), led by a trained interventionist, is a well-established evidence-based practice, and is classified by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) as a first-line
treatment for insomnia (Siebern & Manber , 201 1). Compared to pharmacotherapy , CBT -I provides similar ef fects on short term insomnia symptoms (Morin, et al., 2006),
and better long-term improved sleep ef ficacy (Mitchell, Gehrman, Perlis, & Umscheid, 2012; Buysse, 2013). Ef fect sizes for CBT -I are robust; a meta-analysis of [ADDRESS_78339] s
found medium to large ef fects on sleep latency , sleep quality , wakefulness after sleep onset, and sleep ef ficiency (Irwin, Cole, & Nicassio, 2006). Systematic review of [ADDRESS_78340]-treatment (Morin, et al., 2006). The V eterans Health Administration (VHA) disseminates
and supports its CBT -I manual as one of its rollouts of Evidence-Based Psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. CBT -I has high potential to be particularly ef ficacious for V eterans with SMI, as
there is strong evidence for cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72200] (Dixon, et al., 2010). Several studies
(Dopke, et al., 2004; Myers, et al., 201 1; Kaplan & Harvey , 2013) have tried CBT -I with individuals with psychosis and/or bipolar disorder and found preliminary ef ficacy
for the intervention. They described a need to clinically tailor the intervention to the cognitive and symptomatic challenges experienced with this population, yet they did
not fully document any suggested guidelines. Based on our previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_72201] V eteran clients and V A providers, we have developed
guidelines for the clinical tailoring of CBT -I. This study will test the acceptability and feasibility of conducting CBT -I delivered in accordance with these guidelines, make
refinements to the guidelines based on qualitative feedback, and evaluate the preliminary ef ficacy of CBT -I used in conjunction with these refined guidelines.

Study Pr ocedur es
 
 If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below. (If this study is a collaborative UM/VA
study please list each procedure that is being conducted and the locations where it is being conducted.)
1 * Describe all procedures being performed for research purposes only (these procedures would not be done if individuals were
not in the study) and when they are performed, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safet y or to
minimiz e risks:  
This study has two phases:  
Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial) has two parts:  
Part 1:  
Consent and T ime Point 1 Assessments (n= 20) and  
Part 2:  
CBT-I Treatment, Qualitative Interviews, and T ime Point 2 Assessment Battery (n=6; invited from the 20 in Part 1).  
Part 1: Consent and T ime Point 1 Assessments. For all participants consented, chart review data will be collected on: 1) mental health and medical diagnoses, and 2)
medications (for the purpose of recording sleep aids/ medications that contribute to sleep disturbances). Participants in Part 1 will be asked to complete a demographic
form and an insomnia screening measure [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)]. Completion of these measures will take approximately 10 minutes. Participants who complete
the ISI and score lower than 15 will not be eligible to continue in the study and will be paid $5 for their participation.  
Participants who complete the ISI and score 15 or higher will be asked to wear a V A-approved activity watch Actiwatch (Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770]) that records activity level as
well as complete weekly sleep diaries for two weeks. The purpose of the watch and diary is to track participants' level of activity . The watch will be worn all times except
during bathing or swimming. Data are stored internally and are of f-loaded to a computer via a cable. Study staf f will of fload data to a computer via a cable and use
Actiwatch custom software to derive patterns of activity . Results will be saved onto a FIPS 140-[ADDRESS_78341] 6 months and who do not use a device for sleep apnea management (such as a Continuous
Positive Airway Pressure-CP AP device) will also be invited to complete sleep apnea screening. This screening entails a one-night home sleep test for sleep apnea using
the W atchP AT (Itamar Medical, Inc), an FDA-approved and V A-approved device for detecting sleep apnea. This is a non-invasive, lightweight device which collects
information on arterial pulsatile volume changes at the fingertip and blood oxygen level through a wristwatch connected to a pulse oximeter . For participants invited to
partake in the sleep apnea screening, the RA will first explain and demonstrate use of the W atchP AT. Next, the RA will ask the participant to practice using the device
while the RA watches and assists until the participant can do so independently and all questions are answered. Participants will be given a card with direction reminders
and contact [CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_72202]. The participant will then use the equipment for 1 night and will be required to
return the equipment the following day . Data are stored internally and are of f-loaded to a computer via a cable. Study staf f will use W atchP AT custom software to derive
an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) score. Results will be saved onto a FIPS 140-[ADDRESS_78342] and then immediately transferred behind
the V A firewall. After data of fload and processing, each V eteran’ s AHI will be categorized as absent to mild (AHI less than 15), or moderate to severe (AHI 20 or greater).
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , one night of W atchP AT use is suf ficient to determine the AHI score; participants may be asked to repeat use if their initial reading was invalid. Each participant
asked to use a W atchP AT will be paid $75 once their participation in the home sleep apnea screening is complete.  
At the end of two weeks of Actiwatch and sleep diary use, participants will be asked to complete an assessment battery that will take approximately 150 minutes. The
assessment battery includes measures that assess sleep, health behaviors, and cognitive functioning. Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_78343] 6 months that indicated moderate to severe sleep apnea and who do not regularly use a
device for sleep apnea management will not be eligible to continue in the study . Individuals with elevated AHI (20 or greater) per results on the W atchP AT home sleep
apnea screening will be excluded from Part 2 participation and will be referred to their treatment provider , who will be given information on referral sources for the client
to obtain formal sleep testing and possible treatment. Similarly , if any evidence of a significant sleep disorder is noted the participant will undergo a similar referral
process.  
Part 2: CBT -I Treatment. Participants will be recruited for Part [ADDRESS_78344] agreed to participate in CBT -I. W e anticipate screening
20 records and participants in order to recruit 6 participants for Part 2. Interventionists will be master's level clinicians hired based on their qualifications. Prior to
beginning sessions, we will screen participants’ charts to understand how to best tailor the treatment for them. Participants may be asked to wear a V A-approved activity
watch Actiwatch (Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770]) that records activity level as well as complete weekly sleep diaries. The purpose of the watch and diary is to track participants'
activity while in treatment. The watch will be worn all times except during bathing or swimming. Data are stored internally and are of f-loaded to a computer via a cable. At
the culmination of CBT -I, participants will be required to return the activity watch monitor . Study staf f will of fload data to a computer via a cable and use Actiwatch custom
software to derive patterns of activity . Results will be saved onto a FIPS 140-[ADDRESS_78345] and then immediately transferred behind
the V A firewall. Participants will attend approximately 10 treatment sessions over the span of approximately 4 months. The number of sessions may vary per participant
depending on how many sessions are required to reduce each individual's insomnia symptoms. During each session, participants will also complete the Insomnia
Severity Index (ISI) and the Sleep Need Questionnaire (SNQ). W e will use approximately 10 minutes at the end of every CBT -I session to pose open-ended questions to
attending participants about reactions to that week’ s session content, recommendations for changes, and their views of the usefulness of the session to them as
Veterans with psychosis.  
Qualitative Interviews. At the end of their participation in CBT -I, participants in Part [ADDRESS_78346] will not know the identities of the participants on the recordings and recordings will not include any
identifying information. Research staf f will ensure that the audiorecordings are transferred in a secure manner (encrypted) to the transcriptionist. Participants will be paid
$40 for completion of the qualitative interview .  
Time Point 2 Assessment Battery . At the end of their participation in CBT -I, participants in Part 2 will also complete the ISI and the assessment battery administered in
Part 1 T ime Point 1 Assessment Battery . Participants will be paid $30 for participation in this assessment battery .  
Phase 2 (RCT) has two parts:  
Part 1: Consent and T ime Point 1 Assessments (n=190) and  
Part 2: T reatment with CBT -I or Health and W ellness, T ime Point 2 Assessment Battery , and T ime Point 3 (Follow Up) Assessment Battery (n=60; invited from the 190 in
Part 1), Qualitative Interview (n=30)

WatchP AT reading. Participants who complete the ISI and score lower than 15 will not be eligible to continue in the study and will be paid $5 for their participation.
Participants who complete the T ime Point 1 Assessment Battery will be paid $30. Each participant will be paid $75 when they participate in the home sleep apnea
screening.  
Part 2: T reatment with CBT -I or Health and W ellness. Participants will be recruited for Part [ADDRESS_78348] agreed to participate.
We anticipate screening 190 records and participants in order to recruit 60 participants for Part 2. Participants will be randomized to either the CBT -I (treatment) condition
or the Health and W ellness (control) condition. Procedures for Part 2, T reatment are otherwise the same as in Phase 1, T reatment, with the exception that we will not
pose open-ended questions to participants about recommendations for changes to the treatment.  
Time Point 2 Assessment Battery . The T ime Point 2 Assessment Battery will follow the same assessment procedures as in Phase 1. Approximately two weeks prior to
the T ime Point 2 (Post) Assessment date, participants may be given an Actiwatch and will be given sleep diaries to complete. Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_78349] the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) measure over the phone and strongly encourage the V eteran to
choose a confidential location for this questionnaire.  
Time Point 3 (Follow up) Assessment Battery . At 3 months following the intervention, participants will complete the T ime Point 3 (Follow Up) Assessment Battery used in
Time Points 1 and 2. Approximately two weeks prior to the T ime Point 3 (Follow Up) Assessment date, participants may be given an Actiwatch and will be given sleep
diaries to complete. Participants will be paid $[ADDRESS_78350] the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)
measure over the phone and strongly encourage the V eteran to choose a confidential location for this questionnaire.  
Qualitative Interview: Those participants randomized to the CBT -I intervention may also be invited to complete an additional interview shortly after completing the
treatment sessions. Up to [ADDRESS_78351] of fer this intervention to others. The
interview will take about 1 hour and will be audio recorded. Participants who complete this additional interview will be paid $40 for participation in the qualitative interview . 
OPTION FOR TELEPHONE-BASED SESSIONS:  
For the intervention sessions, the qualitative interview , and the self-report surveys administered at all timepoints, if participants are unable to participate in person, they
will have the option of completing these activities by [CONTACT_648]. Participants completing the self-report measures or qualitative interviews by [CONTACT_72239]. As there is one assessment measure (MA TRICS) that must be completed in person, participant compensation for assessment time
points will be divided if they complete self report measures over the phone ($20) and the MA TRICS in person ($10). Due to COVID-related safety issues with having
participants complete the MA TRICS in person, any participants who had a post or follow up in the COVID era will not be completing the MA TRICS or receiving the
corresponding $[ADDRESS_78352] in order to send electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_72203], blank worksheets, and/or response cards for participants to use during phone sessions. W e will only send these materials at the veteran's request and staf f

Sample Size and Data Analysis
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Provide the r ationale and sample siz e calculations for the proposed target population:  
Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial): Due to the estimated rates of insomnia and sleep apnea in prior literature on V eterans with psychotic disorders, we have determined the
sample size of 20 to be an appropriate number to attain a final sample size of 6. W e determined the sample size of 6 to be feasible for the purpose of an acceptability
trial. 
Phase 2 (RCT): Due to the estimated rates of insomnia and sleep apnea in prior literature on V eterans with psychotic and bipolar disorders, we have determined the
sample size of 190 to be an appropriate number to attain a final sample size of 60. After considering time and resources available with this CDA-2, we believe it will be
feasible to randomize 30 individuals per condition, thus the total sample size of 60. With 25% anticipated loss to follow-up at PT , we anticipate outcome assessments at
PT for approximately 22-[ADDRESS_78355] 35% loss to follow-up at the follow-up visit, leaving 19-20 per condition). With the anticipated 22-[ADDRESS_78356] .80 for detecting between “medium” and “large” ef fect sizes (d=.60) with the ANCOV A
analysis, assuming BL to PT correlation in the response variable is r=0.7. Assuming r=0.6, the detectable ef fect size increases to d=.67 (with power=.80). Up to [ADDRESS_78357] had with the treatment.
2 * Provide the plan for data analysis. Include in the description the t ypes of comparisons that are planned (e.g. , comparison of
means, comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of v ariance, etc.),  which is the primary comparison/analysis, and
how the analyses proposed will relate to the primary purposes of the study:  
Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial): Interviews with V eterans will be audiorecorded and transcribed. T ranscripts will be read and discussed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749], creating a
brief summary that captures our best understanding of what the interviewee sought to convey . We will organize themes, variations, and interrelationships among the
ideas, views, and experiences conveyed by [CONTACT_72241]. W e will pay particular attention to ideas/themes that can contribute to intervention ef fectiveness and
implementation. In doing so, we will consider interviewee’ s personal reflections and will pay close attention to their personal experiences with using or providing
treatment services. The study team will discuss the results to consider refining guidelines for CBT -I in accordance with the unique needs of these V eterans. Resulting
suggestions and recommendations will be used to refine CBT -I guidelines and materials for the RCT evaluating the ef ficacy of CBT -I delivered to V eterans with SMI in
accordance with these guidelines.  
Phase 2 (RCT): Specific Aim 3, Hypothesis 1 (H1). CBT -I intervention feasibility will be demonstrated by [CONTACT_72232], initial intervention engagement,
attendance at intervention sessions, and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72191] . Analysis: We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the feasibility of CBT -I by: [CONTACT_72242] (a) the rate of
recruitment (# consented divided by # approached and # randomized divided by # consented) and compare these to recruitment goals; (b) the percent who engaged in
treatment (% of randomized who attend first 3 sessions), median (and inter-quartile range [IQR]) of the total number of sessions attended and treatment dropout rates (#
who dropped out prior to completing treatment divided by # who engaged); (c) the median (and IQR) of the number of reminders and outreach contacts made for each
participant; (d) the mean (and SD) of the CBT -I Treatment Components Adherence Scale assessed at post-treatment; and (e) the percent of participants who turned in
completed sleep logs and percent of the total number of treatment sessions in which completed sleep logs were turned in. T o assess therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72205] -I, we will
compute percent of sampled sessions in which interventionists were adequately adherent as defined by [CONTACT_72243] V A CBT -I EBP of an average rating
equal to 2 (“satisfactory”), in addition to no items at a score of 0 (“poor”) on the Assessment Competency Rating Scale and the Therapy Competency Rating Scale. For
the Health and W ellness condition, we will also compute percentages of sampled sessions with adequate adherence on our Health and W ellness Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72206] (i.e. average score equal to “acceptable” and no items scored as “unacceptable”).  
Specific Aim 3, Hypotheses 2a-b (H2a,b). Compared to a general Health and W ellness Intervention, CBT -I will show significant a) decreases in insomnia symptoms (as
measured by [CONTACT_72244]) and b) increases in functioning (as measured by [CONTACT_72245]-36). Analysis: For the two outcomes for H2a and H2b we will use the mixed model
described above. For example, to assess the ef fect of CBT -I on insomnia severity as measured by [CONTACT_72246] Y= ISI, the model will be: Y_j=β_0+β_1 "Y" _1+β_2 P"T + "
β_3 "FU + " β_4 "CBT -I +" β_5 "CBT -I∙POST + " β_6 "CBTI∙FU + " e_j , where j = 2, [ADDRESS_78358] , FU, and CBT -I are indicator variables for the PT and FU time-points and the CBT -I intervention condition (versus the control condition). β_5 in the model, equal to
the group dif ferences at PT (i.e. treatment ef fect) and FU, will be tested against the Null hypothesis that that β_5=0. As mentioned above an important out-of-balance
covariate and potential confounder could also be included in the model.  
Secondary Aims. In secondary analyses, actigraphy outcomes will include the length of time between target bedtime (via sleep log information) and sleep onset (sleep
latency), and the number of awakenings after sleep onset. The right-hand-side of the model for Specific Aim 3 will also be used for these outcomes, however the type of
longitudinal model may dif fer. For example, a Poisson or Negative Binomial model using generalized estimating equations (GEE) would likely be a better fit for testing the
treatment ef fect on the count variable, number-of-awakenings.  
Exploratory Aims (EA). W e will explore whether clinical and sleep characteristics, physical comorbidities, and other health behaviors: moderate the ef fect of CBT -I on
insomnia and functional outcomes (EA1), and/or improve as a result of participation in CBT -I (EA2). Analysis: For EA1, we would add the three-way interaction terms
between the baseline health behavior variable, the CBT -I indicator , and either the PT or FU indicator to estimate dif ferential ef fects depending on health behavior status
or level at PT and FU, respectively . For EA2, we would use a model parallel to the model for H2a, b except the health behavior variable would be the response variable.
For a categorical health behavior variable a logit regression model using GEE would be used (e.g. logistic regression). For EA3, if CBT -I improves functioning (H2b), we
will explore whether the data indicate that improvement in sleep/insomnia symptoms mediates the ef fect of CBT -I on functioning. Analysis: W e will use standard methods
for mediation analysis. For EA4 (durability of ef fects), we will examine treatment ef fects at the follow-up visit (i.e. test the significance of β_6) in the comprehensive mixed
model specified above for primary aim 3. Here, durability is operationally defined as significantly better outcome at FU (CBT -I vs Control) for those outcomes that were
significantly better at PT . This approach (versus testing for no change in ef fect between PT and FU) allows for the possibility of significantly better outcome at FU even
while there is attenuation relative to the PT ef fect. 
Qualitative Interviews. Analysis for Phase 2 (RCT) qualitative interviews will follow the same procedure as those in Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial).

Recruitment
 
1 * Describe plans for recruitment, including the identification of potential participants (or acquisition of charts/records/samples)
and initial inter actions with them: (If this study in volves the V A please list all sites at which recruitment will tak e place.):  
Recruitment will take place at outpatient clinics/programs within the V A Maryland Health Care System (V AMHCS). Potential V eteran participants will be identified by
[CONTACT_20750]: (1) CPRS chart review and screening via use of partial HIP AA waiver , (2) V A clinician referrals of participants who meet inclusion criteria and who might
be interested in participating, (3) Self referrals by [CONTACT_72249] a willingness to be contact[CONTACT_20751], (4) Self referral via IRB approved study flyer . 
To recruit participants, we will first screen medical records in order to identify V eterans who meet preliminary eligibility criteria of current diagnosis of a psychotic disorder
or bipolar disorder per medical record review [meeting criteria established by [CONTACT_941] V A Serious Mental Illness T reatment Research and Evaluation Center (SMITREC):
schizophrenic disorders, bipolar disorder , or depression with psychotic features, age [ADDRESS_78369] consult the participant’ s treatment team for permission to begin the consent process. This will help avoid approaching people who may be in crisis
or may not be able to comprehend the study procedures, risks, and benefits.  
 
2 * Describe measures that will be implemented to a void participant coercion or undue influence (if not applicable to the study ,
enter "N/A"):  
Our research team has extensive experience recruiting and obtaining informed consent from individuals with serious mental illness. Research staf f are trained to
recognize symptoms of serious mental illness and cognitive impairment that could undermine the ability to provide informed consent. 
If approached for consent, the recruiter will assess competency to understand and sign the consent form by [CONTACT_72250] a set of IRB approved questions (See
attached evaluation to sign consent questions in Additional Documents). If the individual is unable to answer the questions correctly the RA will review aspects of the
study that the individual did not understand. The RA will then ask the questions a second time. If the individual cannot answer them a second time they will be judged not
competent to give consent, he or she will not be included in the study . Individuals will be told that their participation is completely voluntary and that they can choose to
stop their participation at any time without any negative consequences.

Resear ch Related Risks
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer box below.
1 * Individually list each research-related risk, using a separ ate line for each.  Next to each risk, delineate the
likelihood/seriousness of the risk, and the pro visions for minimizing the risk:  
(1) Some participants may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when they have to answer questions that they may feel are personal (small likelihood, low degree of
seriousness). T o minimize this risk, participants are told before each assessment the nature of the questions being asked and are told to answer honestly but to feel free
to not answer questions that make them feel uncomfortable. Study interviewers are trained to talk about personal material with patients and to engage in discussions in a
supportive and empathic and nonjudgmental way . 
(2) Participants may feel bored or tired due to the length of time required to complete the interview/assessments (moderate likelihood, low degree of seriousness). T o
address this risk, participants will be given the option of scheduling the assessments over two appointments on two dif ferent days. In cases in which a participant is tired
or bored during an assessment, he/she will be of fered breaks or allowed to end the assessment and finish the remainder on another day . 
(3) Distress During Assessments (small likelihood, low degree of seriousness). Before consent and before and during each data collection, participants are informed that
they are free to decline to answer any interview question(s) or to discontinue the interview at any time. If participants feel uncomfortable or fatigued, or seem so to the
RA, they are encouraged to take a break and continue again later , or to stop the interview . In our research with people with serious mental illnesses over the past several
years, few research participants have expressed distress from participating in the assessments and interviews. Nonetheless, all RAs have been trained to stop the
interview if a participant becomes distressed and will have the resources needed to assist him/her in obtaining the level of support or assistance they require, including
crisis intervention if needed.  
(4) Participants may feel some discomfort with discussing their cognitions related to sleep or with restructuring their nighttime routines to accommodate the activity
structuring involved in CBT -I (moderate likelihood, low degree of seriousness). Likewise, participants may feel some discomfort with discussing their health behaviors in
the Health and W ellness intervention. However the CBT -I and the Health and W ellness intervention protocols are not generally considered unpleasant and more severe
reactions are uncommon based on prior studies using CBT -I and Health and W ellness.  
(5) Potential loss of confidentiality (small likelihood, moderate degree of seriousness). All project staf f are thoroughly trained in issues relating to maintaining
confidentiality of research data. Statistical analyses will be based on group data; no individual data will be reported. There is a slight risk of a confidentiality breach
related to data collected for research purposes from participant interviews and medical records. Study participants will be informed that information obtained through
research interviews is confidential; potential risks to data security and the measures we take to protect it will be reviewed with them during the informed consent process.
Numerous steps will be taken to ensure research interview data confidentiality and security . To protect confidentiality , hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_72211]' medical records are identified only by [CONTACT_72252] a locked file cabinet
behind a locked of fice door at the V A Maryland Health Care System, MIRECC suite ([ADDRESS_78373], Baltimore, MD). All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_72212] a locked cabinet in a locked of fice in the V A Maryland Health Care System, MIRECC suite ([ADDRESS_78374], Baltimore, MD). Only
designated research staf f members have access to the password protected file that links participants' identities to their codes. This file is located on a secure server
located in the V A Maryland Health Care System, MIRECC suite ([ADDRESS_78375], Baltimore, MD). Consent forms which contain participants' names are kept in a
locked cabinet in a locked of fice that is located in the V A Maryland Health Care System, MIRECC suite ([ADDRESS_78376], Baltimore, MD). 
Electronic data are kept on a password protected computer server , of which the passwords are only known to the study team members. Electronic research data are
backed up regularly . All electronic research data with identifiers will be stored at our research of fices at the V A Maryland Health Care System, MIRECC suite ([ADDRESS_78377], Baltimore, MD), and behind the V A firewall. In the event of any incidents, unauthorized access of sensitive data or storage devices or noncompliance with
security controls, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_72213] f will immediately contact [CONTACT_941] V AMHCS Information Security Of ficer, Privacy Of ficer and the V AMHCS
Research Compliance Of ficer and the University of Maryland IRB.  
(6) Some participants may feel uncomfortable with being audio recorded (small likelihood, low degree of seriousness). There is also a slight risk of a breach of
confidentiality regarding the identities of the participant on the recording. T o minimize this risk, research staf f will label all recordings with an anonymous code. Access to
the file that links participant names to their project ID number will be stored behind the V A firewall at research of fices at the V A Maryland Health Care System, MIRECC
suite ([ADDRESS_78378], Baltimore, MD).  
(7) Some participants may experience skin irritation as a result of wearing the watch (small likelihood, low degree of seriousness). During consent and when being
assigned the watch, participants are informed of this potential risk and that if this were to happen to them, they should remove the watch and discontinue use.
Participants will be informed that they can call study staf f and/or their physician should they have any concerns at any time. Participants who inform study staf f of an
adverse reaction to the watch will not be asked to use it at subsequent visits.

Potential Benefits and Alternatives
If you uploaded a separate research protocol document in the ‘Research Protocol’ page, cite the applicable
section and page numbers from that document in the answer boxes below.
1 * Describe the potential direct benefit(s) to participants:  
Participants in this study may learn strategies/tools and receive resources to reduce their insomnia symptoms.  
2 * Describe the importance of the knowledge expected to result from the study:  
Participation in this study may benefit other individuals and V eterans with SMI (i.e., psychotic and bipolar disorders) through the development of evidence-based
guidelines, tools, and educational materials to significantly reduce insomnia symptoms and therefore facilitate functional recovery . 
Phase 1 (Acceptability T rial): This study aims at examining the acceptability of CBT -I as delivered with guidelines for V eterans with psychosis. Knowledge derived from
this study could help us better understand vital components of the guidelines which need to be refined to optimize the provision of evidence-based services to V eterans
with psychotic disorders. The resulting guidelines will be used in future RCT s of CBT -I, will be published in the V A CBT -I manual and will enable us to better implement
CBT-I for V eterans with psychosis in V A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72214].  
Phase 2 (RCT): This study aims to examine the feasibility and preliminary ef ficacy of CBT -I. Knowledge derived from this study could inform future ef forts to design
interventions to improve V eterans’ rehabilitation and enhance functioning and recovery due to sleep disorders.
3 * Describe how the potential risks to participants are reasonable in relationship to the potential benefits:  
The major risks to participants are boredom, embarrassment, and potential loss of confidentiality . These risks are outweighed by [CONTACT_72253] -I can be tailored to the needs of V eterans with psychotic and bipolar disorders and learning new strategies/tools and resources to reduce
insomnia symptoms. This understanding will be used to underlie the development of new strategies to optimize sleep treatment for people with serious mental illness.
4 * Describe the alternativ es to participation in this study . If there are no alternativ es, state that participation is v oluntary and
the alternativ e is not to participate. F or interv ention studies, describe appropriate alternativ e clinical procedures or courses of
treatment a vailable to subjects.  
Participation in this study is voluntary . The alternative is not to participate.

Informed Consent Pr ocess
 
 
If the study does not involve interaction with participants or a waiver of consent is being requested , answer
“N/A” to the questions below.
 
1 * Indicate the t ype(s) of consent that will be in volved in this study: (check all that apply)  
 Not applicable (study may qualify as exempt)
 Request to W aive Consent/Parental Permission (Consent is not being obtained)
 Request to Alter Consent (Some Elements of Consent W aived)
 Request to W aive Documentation of Consent (V erbal/Oral Consent)
 Written Consent Form
 Electronic Consent
 
2 * Describe the Informed Consent process in detail:  
Our research staf f are carefully trained on obtaining consent from participants with mental illness and supervised by [CONTACT_72258] f members. If a potential participant
indicates interest in participating, the study interviewer will meet the participant, introduce him/herself to the participant, provide an overview of the project, and invite
him/her to participate. Interested participants are provided an informed consent form. Staf f members are trained to recognize symptoms of severe mental illness and
cognitive impairment that could undermine a participant's ability to provide informed consent. The consent form is reviewed in detail with all participants. Research
staff are trained in strategies for interacting with people with severe and persistent mental illness, including speaking slowly and clearly , stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72222] , and providing time for questions.  
After the consent form has been summarized and reviewed and all questions answered, the staf f confirms that the participant is still interested in participating by
[CONTACT_20771] a verbal response. Those who express willingness to provide consent must complete a brief questionnaire to assess competency and understanding of the
consent form (see evaluation to sign consent questions in additional documents). If the participant is unable to answer the questions correctly , staf f re-reviews the
aspects of the study that the participant did not understand. The staf f member asks the questions a second time. If the participant cannot answer all questions
correctly , he/she will not be enrolled in the study . 
Per IRB regulations, a copy of the signed consent form is given to the participant, and the original is kept in the research of fice. Participants will also receive a Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Authorization to Obtain, Use and Disclose Protected Health Information for Research (HIPP A) that will be reviewed and
summarized for them. Staf f will ask participants if they have any questions once the document has been read, and then participants will sign the authorization. A copy
of this signed form will be given to the participant, and the original is kept in the research of fice. 
In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_72223] V eterans Af fairs: a) social security numbers of veterans will not be solicited; b) research staf f will
restrict telephone and other contacts with veterans to the procedures and data elements outlined in the IRB approved protocol; c) initial contact [CONTACT_72259]; d) verification of the
study will be provided following the guidelines set forth in HRPP/IRB policies and procedures 10G.  
Request to W aive Documentation of Consent:  
A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested because a participant developed some skin irritation under the wristband of one of the watches used in the
protocol. For this new risk, we will request verbal consent by [CONTACT_72260], either via telephone or an in-person
appointment, whichever would occur first, so they do not have to wait until their next study appointment to receive the information. Since this is believed to be a
minimal risk, we wanted to minimize the burden that would be placed on participants to complete a written reconsent process. W e also believe that this new
information will not change participants' willingness to continue participation, as we will not ask them to continue wearing the watch should this situation arise. Study
staff will use the script provided in "additional documents" and document this in participants' study records. If other anticipated risks would occur , this process will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  
A waiver of written documentation of consent is being requested to inform participants of the option to complete assessments, the interview , and intervention
sessions via telephone if needed, as well as to be emailed resources, materials, and/or response cards. W e will request verbal consent by [CONTACT_72261], either via telephone or an in-person appointment, whichever would occur first, so they do not have to wait until their next study
appointment to receive the information. Since this is believed to be minimal risk, we wanted to minimize the burden that would be placed on participants to complete
a written reconsent process. W e also believe that this new information will not change participants' willingness to continue participation, as we are broadening their
options for remote participation. Study staf f will use the script provided in "additional documents" and document this in participants' study records.
 
3 * Confirm that the consent process will explain the following:  
    • The activities in volve research.  
    • The procedures to be performed.   
    • That participation is v oluntary .   
    • The name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_72262] .  
  Yes No 
 
4 * Describe who will obtain Informed Consent:  
The research staf f listed in this protocol.
 
5 * If obtaining consent from a legally authoriz ed representativ e (LAR), describe how y ou will confirm that the individual is the
LAR and can pro vide legally effectiv e informed consent. (Answer "N/A" if not obtaining consent from LARs)

Participants must correctly answer a set of questions regarding the study . If they do not answer all of the questions correctly after 2 attempts, they will not be eligible
to participate.
 
8 * Describe the consider ation for ongoing consent:  
Staff will review the procedures of the protocol, potential risks and benefits, right to withdraw and how confidentiality of research data will be maintained with the
participant before each interview . If they are not able to provide continued consent, they will be removed from the study .

VA-Specific Criteria
 
1 * What is the relev ance of this research to the mission of V A and the V eteran population that it serv es*?  
Veterans with SMI (serious mental illness; i.e., psychosis and bipolar disorders) are at elevated risk of disability , high health care spending, reduced quality of life, and
early mortality . Thus there is an urgent need to develop empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-derived guidelines for the clinical use of V A EBPs which would target functional outcomes for this
population. Insomnia treatment for V eterans with SMI is imperative in this regard. Insomnia is prevalent among people with SMI, causes them significant distress, and is
associated with long-term negative consequences for their physical, emotional, psychosocial, and cognitive recovery . It is also one of the most frequent reasons for
mental health referrals in the VHA. Further , insomnia represents a significant obstacle to the recovery of V eterans with psychosis and bipolar disorders specifically . As a
result, during the V A Evidence-Based Psychotherapy (EBP) consultation process, providers are currently routinely advised to avoid using CBT -I with V eterans with these
symptoms. Thus it is likely that most of these V eterans are not of fered this evidence-based intervention. The VHA Uniform Mental Health Services Handbook clearly
states that V eterans with SMI must be of fered quality interventions comparable to the care received by [CONTACT_39785] V eterans. This research will address this inequity by [CONTACT_72265] -I with these V eterans and test the preliminary ef ficacy of CBT -I delivered to V eterans with SMI in accordance with these
guidelines.
 
2 * Describe who will be enrolled in this study:  
 Non-veterans will be enrolled in this study
 Only veterans will be enrolled in this study
 Veterans and Non-veterans will be enrolled in this study
 
2.1 * If non- veterans will be enrolled in this study , provide a description of non- veterans who will be enrolled (F or example:
communit y members, family members/caretak ers of V eterans, clinicians/caregiv ers to V eterans, etc.):  
Non-V eterans will not be enrolled in this study .
 
2.2 If non- veterans will be enrolled in this study , provide a substantiv e justification** for the enrollment of non- veterans in this
research:  
 
2.3 * If this is a V A-funded study , was the use of non- veterans discussed within y our merit a ward proposal?  
 Yes
 No

VA Mission Statement 
To fulﬁll President Lincoln's promise “To care for him who shall have borne the ba le, and for his widow, and his orphan” by [CONTACT_72266]’s Veterans. 
VA Core Values 
VA’s ﬁve core values underscore the obliga ons inherent in VA’s mission: Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect, and Excellence. The core values
deﬁne “who we are,” our culture, and how we care for Veterans and eligible beneﬁciaries. Our values are more than just words – they aﬀect outcomes
in our daily interac ons with Veterans and eligible beneﬁciaries and with each other. Taking the ﬁrst le er of each word—Integrity, Commitment,
Advocacy, Respect, Excellence—creates a powerful acronym, “I CARE,” that reminds each VA employee of the importance of their role in this
Department. These core values come together as ﬁve promises we make as individuals and as an organiza on to those we serve. 
I n t e g r i t y: Act with high moral principle. Adhere to the highest professional standards. Maintain the trust and conﬁdence of all with whom I engage. 
C o m m i t m e n t: Work diligently to serve Veterans and other beneﬁciaries. Be driven by [CONTACT_72267]’s mission. Fulﬁll my individual
responsibili es and organiza onal responsibili es. 
A d v o c a c y: Be truly Veteran-centric by [CONTACT_72268] fying, fully considering, and appropriately advancing the interests of Veterans and other beneﬁciaries. 
R e s p e c t: Treat all those I serve and with whom I work with dignity and respect. Show respect to earn it. 
E x c e l l e n c e: Strive for the highest quality and con nuous improvement. Be though ul and decisive in leadership, accountable for my ac ons, willing to
admit mistakes, and rigorous in correc ng them. 
** 
a. Non-Veterans may be entered into a VA-approved research study that involves VA outpa ent or VA hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23047] (38 CFR 17.45, 17.92), but
only when there are insuﬃcient Veteran pa ents suitable for the study. The inves gator must jus fy including non-Veterans and the IRB must review
the jus ﬁca on and provide speciﬁc approval for recruitment of non-Veterans. 
b. Non-Veterans may be recruited for studies that will generally beneﬁt Veterans and their well-being but would not include Veterans as subjects.
Examples include surveys of VA providers, studies involving Veterans’ family members, or studies including ac ve duty military personnel. Although
ac ve duty military personnel are not considered Veterans, they should be included in VA studies whenever appropriate. 
--- 
e. Non-Veterans may not be entered into VA studies simply because a non-Veteran popula on is easily accessible to the inves gator.

VA Maryland Health Car e System Review Requir ed
 
1Note:  Based on the answers provided in your submission, this protocol qualifies as a V A study . Therefore, V AMHCS Research &Development (R&D) Committee
approval (in addition to IRB approval) is required  prior to engaging in any research activities. Importantly , you must submit the protocol to the V AMHCS Research
Service  within 60 days of IRB approval.  
**Details related to the V A submission and approval processes are best obtained by [CONTACT_72269] V A Research Of fice (Fred Ivey @ [PHONE_1739]
x6582). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_72225] V A until after IRB approval is obtained, we strongly encourage immediate consultation with the V A R&D service, allowing time
for early familiarization with V A requirements and V A Service clearance for your proposed work.
VA Research Service Forms  can be accessed using the following link:  
https://www .maryland.va.gov/research/human/human_subject_forms.asp  
**In addition to the post-IRB V A approval process referenced above, there are also V A-specific items that must be addressed before  IRB review . Failure to address the
two V A components listed below will prevent your protocol from even receiving a full IRB review .
1. VA information security and privacy Officer (ISO-PO) Approval: This must happen before the IRB will move your protocol to full-board review . The ISO-PO
approval process is initiated by [CONTACT_72270]-PO checklist (accessible through the V A Forms link above) to the Baltimore V A Research Service. Personnel
from the V A Research Of fice will then work to get the required approval signatures, ensuring that the signed ISO-PO checklist is uploaded as a public comment to
your protocol’ s History Log.  Again, your protocol CANNOT  move forward to full IRB review without a fully signed ISO-PO checklist in the History Log, so getting
that item submitted to the V A Research Service as quickly as possible should be a top priority .  
2. Specification of Research Activity Locations:  VA policy mandates that locations of all research activities (including data coordination, data analysis, and data
storage) be clearly specified within appropriate sections of the CICERO protocol and the V A Informed Consent Document. Please ensure that locations of all
research activities are clearly specified throughout these documents before  submitting the protocol to IRB. This is particularly important for “V A Collaborative
Studies” (i.e. those studies involving research activities that occur at both V A and non-V A sites).  However , all studies, be they collaborative or not, should make
clear delineation of research activity locations and data locations an emphasis.

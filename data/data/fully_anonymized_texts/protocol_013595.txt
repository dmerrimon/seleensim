Phase:   Phase  1 
Statistical Methods : 
The sample size for Part 1 of this study was determined by [CONTACT_843317].  Approximately 40 patient s will be treated in Part  1 of this study (Dose 
Escalation Phase) to e stablish dose limiting toxicitie s (DLT), maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD),  and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) . 
The purpose of Part [ADDRESS_1171962] in human research is to document that there is some evidence of a response.  Upon completion of Part  1 of this study, up to approximately 105 
evaluable patients  with certain cancer types and/or characterized genetic alterations will be 
treated with the RP2D (which may be the same or lower than the MTD).  The observation of DLTs in more than 33% of patients in any Part [ADDRESS_1171963] 6 patients enrolled  at 
any time during Part 2 will trigger temporary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_843295]2D in the specific cohort.  Subsequent patients will be treated with a dose lower than the initial MTD and this dose will be determined in discussion with the Clinical Investigators, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
Enrollment of up to 15 evaluable patients in each cohort  provides an 80% probability of 
seeing at least one positive response if the true response rate is at least 10%.  Allowing for a 
low response rate in these patient cohorts is appropriate based on unmet medical need.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 1 INTRODUCTION 
A critical  hallmark of cancer is the activation of cell -growth signaling cascades  independent 
of appropriate growth stimuli ( Hanahan 2000).  A canonical example of a cell  growth control 
circuit is the mitogen -activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway .  Here, surface receptors 
activated by [CONTACT_843318] a linear relay system: RAS 
family GTPases activate RAF family protein kinases, which in turn trigger a phosphorylation cascade involving MEK and ERK family kinases.  ERK kinases activate an array of direct effectors that ultimately translate growth signaling into essential  cellular functions including 
cell division and cell survival. 
Aberrant activation of the MAPK pathway is frequently observed in cancer.  Often , 
components of the MAPK pathway  undergo direct  genetic mutation, causing constitutive 
activation of the signaling cascad e in t he absence of appropriate ligands.  For example, 
members of the RAS GTPase family ( KRAS, NRAS , and HRAS ) were among some of the 
first endogenous oncogenes demonstrated to exhibit spontaneous, activating mutation s in a 
variety of cancer s, including pancreatic, colorectal and non- small cell lung malignancies  
(McCoy 1983 ).  Later , auto -activating mutations in MAPK protein kinase B RAF  were 
identified in over fifty per cent of all late stage melanoma patients  (Davies 2002).  MEK  
mutations are rarer, occurring at a frequency of 8% in melanomas ( Nikolaev 2012); while 
ERK  mutations resulting in tumorigenesis were only recently reported ( Deschenes -Simard 
2014).   Aberrant activation of the MAPK s ignaling cascade may be present  in a large 
proportion of cancers, and direct MAPK pathway mutations may account for a 
preponderance of “driver” mutations in specific cancers.   
The US Food and Drug Administration has recently approved two selective BRAF  inhibitors, 
vemurafenib and dabrafenib, as monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_843297]
V600-mutant metastatic 
melanoma.  Though response rates can be as high as 50%, duration of response is often 
measured in months, not years.  The MEK1/[ADDRESS_1171972] -line use of trametinib administered in combination with dabrafenib offers an 
even greater improvement in overall survival compared with vemurafenib monotherapy, without increased ov erall toxicity  (Robert 2015), highlighting the potential usefulness of 
simultaneously targeting multiple stages of the MAPK signaling pathway.   This therapeutic 
combination was also associated with a lower incidence of MEK inhibitor -associated rash 
and BRAF  inhibitor-induced hyperproliferative skin lesions compared with  each  single agent  
alone ( Flaherty 2012).  Recently, a phase III trial also demonstrated significant improvements 
in overall survival (25.[ADDRESS_1171973] ratio [ HR] 0.71, P = 0.0107), progression -
free survival ( PFS) (11.0 vs . 8.8 months, HR 0.67, P = 0.0004), and overall response (69% 
vs. 53%; P = 0.0014) with dabrafenib plus trametinib versus dabrafenib alone in patients with

with metastatic melanoma  containing BRAFV600 mutations.  
Though BRAF /MEK -targeted combination therapy has significantly prolonged PFS 
compared with  single -agent therapeutic options, patients still eventually develop resistance 
and disease progression after ~9 to 11 months ( Robert 2015, Flaherty 2012, Long 2015).  
Several mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF  inhibition have been previously 
identified, including the generation of BRAF splicing variants, BRAF amplification, 
development of MEK1  or NRAS  mutations, and upregulation of by[CONTACT_843245] ( Poulikakos 
2011, Corcoran 2010, Nazarian 2010, Shi 2014, Johannessen 2010).  Central to these mechanisms of resistance is the resultant reactivation of ERK signaling, which enables the rapid recovery of MAPK pathway signaling and escape of tumor cells from BRAF  inhibitor 
therapy  (Paraiso 2010).  Furthermore, alterations in the MAPK signaling pathway have also 
been shown to confer resistance to BRAF /MEK inhibitor combination therapy, including 
MEK1  or MEK2  mutations  and BRAF amplification  (Wagle 2011, Wagle 2014, Ahronian 
2015).  ERK inhibition alone or in combination may have the potential to overcome or avoid resistance from upstream mutations, as it is the final target of the MAPK signaling pathway.

1.1 STUDY DRUG 
BVD -523 is a small molecule that potently inhibits both ERK1 and ERK2 protein kinases in 
the sub-nanomolar range, while not significantly inhibiting any of an array of kinases even at 1000- fold greater concentrations .  BVD -523 potently inhibits growth and survival in cultured 
cancer cell lines; melanoma, colorectal and pancreatic lines  harboring BRAF or RAS  
mutation s are among those most susceptible  to the drug.  In animals be aring ectopic tumor 
xenografts, orally administered BVD-[ADDRESS_1171976] in capsule form.

or MEK  kinases, or members of the RAS GTPase family .  Given this biological rationale and

characterized cellular, biochemical or genetic aberrations.   The modern view of cancer as a 
fundamentally genetic disease has greatly aided the invention and development of several 
such “targeted” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  For instance, a common  mutation found in chronic myelogenous 
leukemia produces the BCR-ABL oncogene, and direct inhibition of this gene product using 
the kinase inhibitor drug i matinib /Gleevec™  (Ren 2005) provides substantial benefit to 
patients.   Similarly, the observation of genetic amplification and/or overexpression of EGFR 
(Putz 1999), ErbB2 ( Hynes 2005) and Flt-3 ( Tse 2000) receptor tyrosine kinase genes  led to 
therapeutics that inhibit each  in a potent and specific fashion, and likewise offer 
improvements to standard of care (erlotininb/ Tarceva™  [Perez -Soler 2004] ; 
gefitinib/Iressa™  [Herbst 2004] ; cetuximab/Erbitux  [Graham  2004]).  For these and  other 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], clinical benefit is accompanied by a safety profile broadly favorable compared to cytotoxic drugs: this occurs because each therapy spar es healthy tissue, but 
damag es cancer tissue where oncogenic mutations and malignant cell processes are confined.  
A unique a rray of oncogenic mutations cluster  in the mitogen -activated protein kinase, or 
MAPK, pathway, a key signal transduction cascade that controls  cell-growth s ignaling in 
many tissues  (Sebolt-Leopold 2004a , Chang 2003, Hilger 2002, Kohno 2003, Smalley 2003).  
Activating mutations in RAS GTPase family members are found in ~30% of all cancers (Bos 1989), with particularly high incidence in pancreatic (90%) ( Almoguera 1988) and 
colon (50%) cancer ( Salhab 1989).  Activating somatic missense mutations of BRAF are 
frequent in melanomas (up to 80%) ( Pollock 2002, Gorden 2003), papi[INVESTIGATOR_368617] (36%) 
(Xu 2003), colon (up to 18%) ( Ikenoue 2003),
 and ovarian (14%) ( Hsu 2004 ) cancers.   Less 
frequently, activating mutations have also been observed in MEK family kinases, which are the direct substrates of RAF kinases.  MEK kinases phosphorylate and activate the ERK kinase gene family .  ERK kinases phosphorylate numerous proteins that act as MAPK 
pathway “effectors”; these substrates directly promote cell division, reduce cell death, and increase cell motility and cell differentiation  (Chang 2003, Sebolt- Leopold 2004b).  To date, 
spontaneous activating mutations in ERK kinases have not been observed in human cancers.  Nonetheless , abundant ERK phosphorylation reflecting elevated MAPK signaling is  
frequently observed in cancer contexts where extracellular growth factors are e levated  
(Wan  2004), or where activating mutations in RAS, BRAF , or MEK genes have occurred. 
In this setting, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_843298].  Notably, vemurafenib (ZELBORAF
®), is an inhibitor of mutated BRAF that, when dosed in 
patients with metastatic melanoma h arboring specific BRAF activating mutations, induces 
tumor regression and improves overall survival in this defined patient population (Flaherty  2010, Sosman 2012, Chapman 2011).

often influences their therapeutic utility.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_843300] f indings suggestive of

phenomenon of acquired drug resistance ( Nazari an 2010, Poulikakos 2011, Shi 2012, 
Hatzivassiliou 2012) .  Acquired resistance may limit the clinical efficacy of MAPK directed 
agents  even when  their initial activity  is promising.  T he severe consequences and complex 
biology of acquired resistance in patients treated with MAPK signaling inhibitors  suggest 
that additional, novel agents targeting the pathway may display improved  durability  and 
overall efficacy  (Hatzivassiliou 2012). 
Given  this background, we plan to assess the sa fety and efficacy of BVD -523, which is a 
potent and selective inhibitor of the ERK family kinases.   Drugs targeting other components 
of the MAPK pathway exhibit promising therapeutic activity, while also being  limited by 
[CONTACT_843319].  Targeting the downstream MAPK kinase, ERK , could possibly evoke a unique and desirable balance of durable efficacy and suitable 
tolerability.  As such, BVD -[ADDRESS_1171980] activity.  
1.4  SAFETY EXPERIENCE (PRE -CLINICAL AND CLINICAL) 
Human experience w ith BVD -523 is limited to the ongoing BVD-523-01 and BVD-523-02 
studies, t hus the entire safety profile of BVD -523 is not known at this time.  
Prominent treatement- emergent events  in the BVD -523 program include effects on skin and  
the GI system .  Summary details for specific toxicities (both observed and potential) are 
provided below; additional information is presented in the BVD-523 Investigator’s Brochure. 
Dermatological Lesions  
Dermatological lesions have been seen in rodent GLP toxicology studies of BVD -523.  
Several of the following findings displayed exposure- dependent increases in incidence and/or 
severity: non- specific dermal inflammation, pustular dermatitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_843301].  These toxicities appeared to be associated with predominantly reversible pharmacodynamics , as the majority of findings were mild and/or of low incidence in animals 
that underwent dose cessation. 
In clinical studies, other drugs that inhibit components of the MAPK pathway exhibit 
cutaneous toxicity.  Multiple investigational inhibitors of MEK1/2 kinases exhibit exposure-dependent, dose-limiting and reversible skin toxicities in a proportion of patients.  Specific toxicities include: non -specific rash and pruritus, acneiform dermatitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_843302].  Additionally, clinical experience with both investigational agents and approved drugs that primarily target BRAF kinase have displayed exposure-dependent and reversible

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 skin toxicities in a proportion of treated patients; relevant lesions here include 
kerato acanthoma-type squamous cell carcinomas, non- cancerous hyperkeratosis and actinic 
keratosis.  
A similar pattern of cutaneous toxicity has been observed in patients treated with BVD -[ADDRESS_1171981]- in-man study, with approximately tw o thirds of patients experiencing rash and/or 
prurit us and one patient with a history of squamous cell carcinoma developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a squamous 
cell carcinoma while on treatment with BVD -523.  Rash has been treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or 
oral agents (e.g., steroids, a ntibiotics ), and dose reductions/interruptions as needed.  One 
patient (dosed at 900 mg b.i.d.) in BVD -523-01, experienced an event of grade 3 erythema 
multiforme  that was considered related to BVD -523 and that resulted  in dose interruption.  
Similarly, one patient (dosed at 750 mg b.i.d.) in BVD-523- [ADDRESS_1171982] been observed at high frequency in both BVD-523-01 and BVD-523-02, in some cases occurring in association with dehydration and elevated creatinine/renal insufficiency.  Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been managed with BVD -523 dosing interruptions and supportive 
medications as needed and, in some cases, dose reduction of BVD-523 has been undert aken .  
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage (both upper and lower) has been reported in the BVD-[ADDRESS_1171983] and/or ALT have also been observed in the BVD- [ADDRESS_1171984] also been observed , somet imes in conjuction with vomiting, 
diarrhea and dehydration.  Management has consisted of study agent interruption, re-hydration and, in some instances, dose reduction or  discontinuation of study drug. 
Hematological Effects  
Hematological effects observed in  a rat repeat dose study included lowered reticulocyte 
counts, mean corpuscular volume, platelet counts (in females only) and increased neutrophil, monocyte, basophil and large unstained cell counts.  In dogs the clinical pathology findings were consistent  with inflammation (increased white blood cell count, neutrophils, fibrinogen 
and globulin) and decreased albumin and hemorrhage (decreased red cell mass).  Anemia has been noted in the BVD-523 program.  One case of possibly related, grade 3, reversible, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura was reported in a patient with melanoma while receiving BVD -523 at a dose of 450 mg b.i.d.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 In order to monitor for potential hematologic toxicity in humans, routine clinical laboratory 
hematology tests, should be performed and any indication of abnormalities may result in further investigations. 
Phototoxicity  
BVD -523 exhibits an absorbance peak in the range of UV- A/UV- B light, specifically at 
~[ADDRESS_1171985] exhibited skin phototoxicity. 
Beyond dermatological monitoring (above), potential risks of direct phototoxicities induced 
by [CONTACT_787106] -[ADDRESS_1171986] not revealed any exposure -dependent 
ophthalmological toxicities ; however, clinical studies of MEK1/[ADDRESS_1171987] mechanistically attributable risks observable in a proportion of patients.  Of particular concern are the following dose- limiting toxicities comprising 
expo sure-dependent, serious adverse events during clinical studies: retinal vein occlusion, 
retinal detachment and related vision abnormalities.  In this ongoing first- in-man Phase [ADDRESS_1171988] experienced visual changes, includi ng 
dimmed/blurry vision  and unspecified vision changes. In addition, one patient (dosed at 900 
mg b.i.d.), experienced an event of central serous retinopathy.   While it is not definitively understood whether ocular toxicities reflect primary pharmacology associated with global 
inhibition of the MAPK pathway, specific management and exclusion criteria are defined in this clinical protocol , as the toxicities could potentially severely and irreversibly impact 
patient well- being.  
Cardiac Effects  
The balance of  preclinical evidence suggests BVD -523 has  a low, but observable, potential to 
cause QT prolongation.  Given potentially unique species sensitivity, as well as possibly unknown consequences following chronic dosing, patients dosed with BVD -523 will be 
monitored for potential QTc prolongation and related cardiotoxicities, including 12 hour Holter monitoring following dosing on days 1 and 15.  T here has been one event of  possibly 
related, grade 3 heart failure in a patient with melanoma which occurred  after h aving 
received 10 days  of study drug (600 mg b.i.d. ). 
Tissue M ineralization  
Tissue mineralization has been observed in rodent toxicology studies of BVD-523.  The incidence and severity of mineralization was dose-dependent and effects were observed in 1 or more tissues at toxic doses.  In animals in which mineralization occurred after treatment 
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-01   
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 with BVD-523, significantly increased serum phosphorus and modestly decreased serum 
calcium were seen; these effects were not observed in animals in which there was n o 
mineralization.  
Tissue mineralization has been reported in rodents with other compounds that target the MAPK pathway and published studies suggest that the MAPK pathway is a negative regulator of matrix mineralization both in  vitro  and in  vivo . 
Routine clinical laboratory tests, including blood chemistry analyses for calcium and inorganic phosphate, will be performed and any indication of abnormalities may result in further investigations.  A clinical monitoring strategy similar to this was previously employed for related drugs that target the MAPK pathway.  
1.4.2  Pharmacology Studies  
BVD -523 is highly efficacious in  vivo  when administered as a single agent in ectopic 
xenograft models of colon, pancreatic and melanoma cancer s, 3 tumor types in which ERK is 
known to be highly activated.  Notably, partial regression was achieved in a colon cancer model (Colo205) when the compound was administered at 50 mg /kg (b.i.d.).  Biomarker 
analys es confirmed that improved efficacy obtained at higher doses of BVD -[ADDRESS_1171989] a significant genetic toxicology risk.   
While BVD -523 modestly inhibits the hERG current (IC
50 3.4 µM ), no significant effects 
were seen in action potentials recorded from dog Purkinje fibers exposed to up to 10 μg /mL, 
and no significant cardiovascular findings were observed upon acute oral dosing of the compound at dose levels up to 50 mg /kg in dogs (C
max = 17.3 µM ).  Thus BVD -[ADDRESS_1171990] a low potential to cause QT prolongation in patients, but, as stated, the study will monitor for signs of cardiovascular effects of BVD -523 in humans. 
No significant cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) inhibition has been observed with the compound.  
In vitro  studies suggest that the compound is metabolized primarily via oxidation by [CONTACT_843320], including 3A4, 2D6, and 1A2.  Furthermore, no significant CYP induction was observed after up to [ADDRESS_1171991] a limited potential for drug -drug interactions.  
BVD -523 HCl salt is orally available in multiple species (absolute bioavailability %F = 23% 
in dog to 100 % in monkey) when formulated as a simple suspension in 1% 
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)  and has a half -life of 2−4 hours across all species. 
BVD -523 was administered to male and female Sprague- Dawley rats in several toxicology 
studies: a GLP study for up to 28 days at dose levels up to 50 mg /kg/day twice daily; for up 
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-01   
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 to 14 days at dose levels up to 100 mg /kg twice daily; and for up to 5 days at dose levels up 
to 150 mg /kg/dose once daily.  The incidence and severity of mineralization seen in these 
studies was dose- dependent and effects were observed in 1 or more tissues at toxic doses.  In 
animals in which mineralization occurred after treatment with BVD -523, significantly 
increased serum phosphorus and modestly decreased serum calcium were seen; these effects 
were not observed in animals in which there was no mineralization.  Therefore, the risk of tissue mineralization can be assessed by [CONTACT_843321].  A clinical monitoring strategy similar to this was previously employed for related drugs that target the MAPK pathway because those compounds likewise elicited mineralization in rodents. 
When BVD -523 was administered to male and fema le Sprague-Dawley rats for up to 28 days 
at a dose level of 25 or 50 mg/kg twice daily, it was poorly tolerated.  Although most clinical 
signs and clinical pathology findings reversed following 4 weeks of recovery, skin lesions and histopathology findings persisted in many tissues at both dose levels after the recovery phase.  Based on these findings, 25 and 50 mg /kg twice daily dose levels were considered 
severely toxic.  Administration of 12.5 mg /kg twice daily for 28 days was generally well -
tolerated by [CONTACT_843322]; however, this dose level was associated with test article-related findings that included: swelling in the neck; decreased forelimb strength; multiple clinical pathology findings; enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, and mammary gland.  Based on these findings, the severely toxic dose in 10% of the animals (STD10) for BVD -523 when 
administered for up to 28 days in Sprague-Dawley rats is 12.5 mg /kg given twice daily 
(25 mg/kg/day).  On Day  28 of the dosing phase, this dose level corresponded with a C
max of 
[ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] ng/ mL and AUC 0-12 of 264868 and 124341 hr.ng/mL for males and 
females, respectively.  
BVD -523 was administered to male and female beagle dogs for up to 28 days at dose levels 
of 15, 5, or 2 mg/kg twice daily.  Initial analysis of the toxicity profile observed shows that BVD -[ADDRESS_1171992] as a photosensitizing agent in man.  
Based on the data accumulated to date, BVD-523 possesses a toxicology profile which presents no impediment to its development as an anti- cancer agent.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 2 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY  
The overall purpose of this study is to support the development of an oral formulation of 
BVD -523 for the treatment of patients with advanced cancers .  BVD -523 is a highly potent, 
selective, and pharmacologically active inhibitor of ERK family kinases.  The compound has demonstrated efficacy as a single agent in preclinical models of colon, pancreatic and melanoma cancers ( Section 1.4.2), and has potential for application alone or in combination 
with existing cancer chemotherapeutics.  
This first -in-human study is being performed to assess the safety and tolerability of BVD -[ADDRESS_1171993] cycle of treatment ( Day 22), and as indicated after completion 
of Cycle 1 .  Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and/or Holter measurements may be 
suspended pending review of accumulated patient experience.

for BVD-523 when administered for up to 28 days in Sprague- Dawley rats was determined to 
be 12.5 mg /kg dosed twice daily (25 mg /kg/day).  A standard 10-fold reduction of this dose 
was scaled to establish  a starting dose of 13.5 mg twice-daily of BVD- 523 (free base 
equivalents) or 14.6 mg twice-daily of BVD-523, based on an average body surface area of 1.8 m

Consistent with current clinical practice and dosing convenience, the proposed starting dose for the Phase 1 clinical study with BVD -523 in cancer patients is 10 mg twice -daily 
(20 mg/day).   
Since there are no pre- clinical data to suggest that flat dosing will lead to greater inter -patient 
PK variability, flat milligram dosing without adjustment for body size will be used in this study ( Mathijssen  2007).  The effects of weight and body surface area on PK may be studied  
retrospectively  as part of the PK analysis.

3.1.2  Study Design 
This clinical study comprises 2 parts:  
• Part 1: Dose -escalation Phase  
• Part 2: Cohort Expansion Phase 
 
Part 1 – Dose -escalation Phase:  A n accelerated dose escalation plan will be used to establish 
dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).  One to 6 patients per treatment cohort will be assigned to receive sequentially higher oral doses of BVD -523 on a twice daily schedul e (b.i.d.) for 21 days (a 
“Cycle ”), starting at a dose of 10 mg  twice daily .  Patients will receive twice -daily oral doses 
of BVD -523 until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a clinical observation 
satisfying an other withdrawal criterion is noted.  Treatment cycles will occur consecutively 
without interruption, except when necessary to manage toxicities.  
Patients with advanced -stage solid tumors only (no hematological malignancies) will be 
enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the study.  The study will initially be conducted as an accelerated single patient design, followed by a standard 3 + 3 design,  informed by [CONTACT_843324]-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-01   
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 accrued safety experience throughout the study (see Table 3.2 below).  All dose- escalation 
decisions will be based on Cycle  [ADDRESS_1171997] after the patient has completed the 21 -day 
treatment cycle.  If the patient exhibits no Grade 2 or greater adverse events, dose escalation 
in a 100% increment  and enrollment will continue with a single patient per cohort.  However, 
when one patient experiences a ≥  Grade 2 t oxicity (excluding alopecia or diarrhea), this 
cohort and subsequent cohorts will be expanded to at least 3 patients each following the 
classic 3  + 3 design and dose escalation increments will be reduced from 100% to a 
maximum of 50%, as determined by [CONTACT_843325], the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor.  Doses will not be escalated unless the patient(s) receiving the highest current dose has been observed for at least 3  weeks.  
The classic 3 + 3 design will be conducted as follow s.  Initially,  3 patients will be enrolled  to 
a cohort; the occurrence of a single drug -related DLT in one of these 3 patients will prompt 
enrollment of up to an additional 3 patients to that same cohort i.e., 3 + 3.  When  more  than 
1 DLT occurs in ≤  6 patient s in a dosing cohort, dose escalation will be stopped and this dose 
level will be identified as the non -tolerated dose.  Doses between the non-tolerated dose and 
the preceding lower dose, where ≤  1 DLT occurred, may be explored to define the MTD.  
This strategy allows for a rigorous determination of MTD, especially if the dose increase that resulted in determination of the non- tolerated dose is relatively large (i.e., >  50%).  
At any time  during the study, the Sponsor and Investigators may request th at cohorts should 
be enlarged or that exploration of intermediate doses between [ADDRESS_1171998] by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_843303].  Part 2 – Cohort-expansion Phase:  A dditional patients with particular tumor types and/or 
cancers harboring specific genetics will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended 
Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) .  Patients must have measurable disease by [CONTACT_393]  1.1.  Patients will 
receive twice daily oral doses of BVD -523 in 21- day treatment cycles until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met ( Section  7.2).  
Treatment cycles will occur consecutively without interruption except when necessary to manage toxicities.  
Total enrollment for Part  2 is targeted at approximately 105 evaluable patients.  Patients will 
be enrolled into 1 of 7 treatment groups.  Group assignments are made according to the following disease characteristics, which correspond to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for Part  2.

The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) may be as high as the MTD and will be 
determined in discussion with the Clinical Investigators, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor.  Observations related to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and any cumulative toxicity observed after multiple cycles may be included in the rationale supporting the RP2D. 
3.2 SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE 
An internal Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)  will be set up to review the safety of  
BVD -[ADDRESS_1172006] of Clinical Investigat ors, the 
Medical Monitor and BVD representatives.  The SMC will review any serious Adverse Event (SAE) that occur s during the s tudy, and will examine the safety of each dose level of 
BVD -523, including toxicities that may occur in later cycles of treatment.   
3.3 SAFETY REVIEW MEETINGS 
The safety review will be performed in all stages of the dose escalation:  
1. Prior to start ing each new dose level after the initial cohort.

or freshly -collected samples.  
3.6 BLINDING AND RANDOMIZATION 
This study is designed as an open- label study.  All patients will receive treatment with  orally 
administered BVD -523.   
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-[ADDRESS_1172007] in human research is to document that ther e is some 
evidence of a response.  Upon completion of Part  1 of this study, up to approximately 105 
evaluable patients  with certain cancer types and/or characterized genetics will be assigned to 
1 of 7 treatment arms and treated with the RP2D determined in  Part 1 (which may be the 
same or lower than the MTD).  The observation of DLTs in more than 33% of patients in any 
Part [ADDRESS_1172008] 6 patients enrolled at any time during Part 2 will trigger temporary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_843295]2D in the specific cohort.  Subsequent patients will be treated with a dose lower than the initial MTD and this dose will be determined in discussion with the Clinical Investigators, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor. 
Enrollment of up to 15 evaluable patients in each cohort  provides an 80% probability of 
seeing at least one positive response if the true response rate is at least 10%.  Allowing for a 
low response rate in these patient cohorts is appropriate based on unmet medical need.   
In Part [ADDRESS_1172009] protocol- specified 
tumor measurement evaluation at the end of Cycle 2 (except for study drug- related AE) will 
be replaced . 
4.2 RECRUITMENT 
Three to 10 study centers will enroll up to 40 patients for Part  1.

At Visit 1 (Screening) a complete medical history will be obtained from each patient.  For female patients of child -bearing potential, the date of the last menstrual period should be 
noted.  Data will be  reviewed at Visit 2 (Baseline) and updated at subsequent visits. 
6.3 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS 
Detailed history of medications and procedures will be documented for each patient at Visit 1 
(Screening) and Visit 2 (Baseline).  Concomitant medications  (especially changes in 
medication) will be documented for each patient at each scheduled visit.   Medications which 
are known to be strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2, or strong inducers of CYP3A4, are not permitted during the study (for list of non -permitted drugs, see 
Appendix 1). 
6.4 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION 
• Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening) . 
• Body weight in kilogram (kg) will be measured at screening and at the beginning of 
each cycle.  
• Body temperature will be measured at each visit.  
• Systolic and dia stolic BP and pulse rate will be measured with the patient in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251].  Blood pressure should be assessed on the same arm during the study. 
 
Full physical examination evaluations at screening should include general appearance, skin, 
neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, and neurological examinations.  Subsequent targeted physical exams should include body systems as appropriate.  
Information about the physical examination must be present in the source documentation at the study site.  The result of the physical examination prior to the start of study drug must be included in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions Case Report Form.  Clinically relevant findings made after the start of study drug, which meet the definition of an adverse event, must be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form.

7.1 EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF THE STUDY 
It is agreed that for reasonable cause, either the investigator or the Sponsor may terminate 
this study, provided a written notice is submitted at a reasonable time in advance of intended termination; if by [CONTACT_843333] , 
Inc., and if by [CONTACT_1034], notice will be provided to each investigator.  
If a severe local reaction or drug- related  SAE occurs at any time during the study, the Safety 
Monitoring Committee will review the case immediately.  
The s tudy will be immediately suspended and no additional BVD -523 doses administered 
pending review and discussion of all appropriate study data by [CONTACT_843334] 1 or more patients at any dose level develop any of the following adverse events deemed to be possibly , 
probably or definitely related to BVD -523 by [CONTACT_11219]/or Medical Monitor, based 
upon close temporal relationship or other factors: 
• Death  
• Anaphylaxis (angioedema, hypotension, shock, bronchospasm, hypoxia, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506])  
 The study will not be restarted until all parties have agreed to the course of action to be taken and the IRB /EC has been notified.  
7.2 EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS 
Patients are to be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent 
• Disease progression (at the discretion of the PI ).  However i t is particularly important 
in patients for which FDA approved BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors are indicated that 
BVD -523 treatment NOT be continued beyond tumor progression. 
• Unacc eptable toxicity  
• Changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further 
treatment in the judgment of the PI  
• Patient non- compliance as assessed by [CONTACT_093]  
• Patient has a positive serum pregnan cy test  (withdrawal is required) 
• Patient is lost to follow -up 
 
Patients will also to be withdrawn at any time if the investigator concludes that it would be in the patient’s best interest for any reason.  Protocol violations do not lead to patient withdrawal unless they constitute a significant risk to the patient’s safety.  
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 8 TREATMENT  
The safety and PK of BVD -523 will be tested in sequentially increasing doses starting at 
10 mg twice daily, initially in single -patient cohorts (for tabular summary, see Table 3.2 ).  
Dose escalations of BVD -523 will occur in 100% increments in single-patient cohorts until 
one patient experiences a ≥  Grade 2 toxicity (excluding alopecia or diarrhea).  This cohort 
and subsequent cohorts will be expanded to at least 3 patients each and subsequent dose-
escalation increments will be reduced from 100% to a maximum of 50%, as determined by [CONTACT_843325], the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor.  If one patient in a 3 -patient cohort experiences a DLT as defined in  Table 3.2, up to 3 additional 
patients will be treated at this dose level.  If more than one DLT occurs in ≤  6 patients, this 
dose level will be defined as the non-tolerated dose and dose escalation will be stopped. 
Doses will not be escalated unless the patient(s) receiving the highest current dose have been 
observed for at least [ADDRESS_1172051] their treatment interrupted until 
the toxicity returns to ≤  Grade 1  or pre -treatment baseline, whichever is more severe.  
Resumption of BVD -523 treatment may then be at the next lower dose level tested or at a 
20–30% dose decrease, aligning with capsule dose avail ability.  
During Part 2 of the study, intrapatient dose modifications are allowed, including dose reductions/interruptions as needed and re-escalations up to and including RP2D, at Clinical Investigators’ discretion .

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 9 ADVERSE EVENT MANAGEMENT  
9.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
An Adverse Event ( AE) is de fined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
administered a medicinal product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the study (investigational) product.  This includes an exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the e CRF under specific efficacy assessments.  Anticipated 
fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, including the disease under study that does not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening, need not be considered AEs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study.  AE information  will be elicited by [CONTACT_222618] t a nonleading question, for example, 
“Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?” AEs should be reported on the appropriate page of the e CRF.
 
9.2 DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
A Serious Adverse Event (S AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose 
(including after the ICF is signed and prior to dosing) that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death  from the event as it occurred)  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (formal admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7521]) or prolongat ion of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283824] a 
treatment -emergent AE are not considered SAEs. 
Progressio n of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE  unless the outcome is fatal during the study or within the 
safety reporting period  (see below) .  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study 
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-01   
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 57 or within the safety reporting period, then the event should be reported usin g the term 
“disease progression” with a CTCAE severity of Grade 5.  
9.3 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS A DVERSE 
EVENTS 
Recording and reporting of adverse events should be in accordance with the current FDA 
“Guidance for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
BA/BE Studies ”. 
Any AE is to be recorded in the eCRF.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the patient’s own words.  Whenever possible, the investigator should combine signs and symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis.  
The existence of an AE may be concluded from a spontaneous report of the patient; from the physical examination; or from special tests e.g. , ECG, laboratory assessments, or other study-
specified tests (source of AE).  
The reporting period begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent through and including [ADDRESS_1172056] also be recorded. 
9.4 INTENSITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
The severity of the AE will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Grading Scale Version 4.03 (see the NCI  CTCAE web page at http://ctep.cancer.gov for det ails).  For AEs not 
covered by [CONTACT_843337], the severity will be characterized as “mild”, “moderate”, or 
“severe” according to the following definitions: 
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 10 STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1.1  Statistical and Analytical Plans  
A formal detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be created prior to the review  of any 
data.  
The purpose of this Phase 1 dose escalation study is to determine the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD), the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) , and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
of orally administered BVD-523.  Groups of 1− [ADDRESS_1172063] 1 dose of BVD -523 will be evaluable  for safety . 
10.1.2  Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size fo r Part 1 of this study was determined by [CONTACT_843317].  Approximately 40 patients will be treated in Part  1 of this study (Dose 
Escalation Phase) to establish dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD),  and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) . 
The purpose of Part [ADDRESS_1172064] in human research is to document that there is some evidence of a response.  Upon completion of Part  1 of this study, up to approximately 105 
evaluable patients  with certain cancer types and/or characterized genetic alterations and/or 
MAPK pathway activation  will be treated with the RP2D (which may be the same or lower 
than the MTD).  The observation of DLTs in more than 33% of patients in any Part [ADDRESS_1172065] 6 patients  enrolled at any time during Part 2 will trigger temporary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_843311]2D in the specific cohort.  Subsequent patients will be treated with a dose lower than the initial RP2D and  this dose will 
be determined in discussion with the Clinical Investigators, the Medical Monitor, and the 
Sponsor. 
Enrollment of up to 15 evaluable patients in all cohorts provides an 80% probability of 
seeing at least one positive response if the true response rate is at least 10%.  Allowing for a low response rate in these patient cohorts is appropriate based on unmet medical need.    
Up to 15 study centers are expected to en roll patients for this study.  
10.1.3  Blinding and Randomization 
This clinical study is open-label, and a ll patients enrolled will be treated with BVD -523.

1. Withdrawn from the [LOCATION_002] marker because of safety reasons  
2. The effect of grapefruit juices varies widely among brands and is concentration- , dose -, and preparation - 
dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain 
preparati on was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low does, single strength).  
3. Not a marketed drug  
4. The effect of St John’s wort varies widely and is preparation -dependent.

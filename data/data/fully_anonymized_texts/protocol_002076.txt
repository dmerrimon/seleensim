Protocol Synopsis
Title Sirolimus treatment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 pneumonia
(The SCOPE Trial)
Rationale In late 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of 
pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, China. This virus has now been designated severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease has been named COVID-19. To date, COVID-19 has affected >1,000,000 individuals across 204 countries and led to ~50,000 deaths. [LOCATION_002] currently has the world’s highest number of affected individuals with COVID-19 in the world, with >200,000 cases and >5,000 fatalities. The disease spectrum from COVID-19 varies within individuals and can broadly be categorized into three subsets: 1) mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_823134] ~80%, 2) severe pneumonia requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51531] ~15%, and 3) critical illness with multiorgan dysfunction in ~5% of the patients. The overall fatality rate from COVID-19 is estimated at ~2%. A number of different investigational agents have been prescribed to patients with COVID-19; these agents can broadly be classified into two subgroups: 1) drugs aimed at inhibiting the viral growth such as the antiviral agents remdesivir and lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]-ritonavir, and hydroxychloroquine (either alone or in combination with azithromycin) and 2) drugs such as the IL-[ADDRESS_1141430] emerged as prognostic biomarkers in 
patients with COVID-19 that can portend an increased propensity to progress towards acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) and death. Key prognostic biomarkers reported thus far include elevated serum levels of ferritin, d-dimer, LDH, and lymphopenia. Lymphopenia has been observed in 60-80% of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]-[ADDRESS_1141431] increased risk of progression to ARDS and death. Lymphopenia was also seen in 50-80% of cases and predicted poor prognosis in patients with severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (SARS), a similar illness to COVID-[ADDRESS_1141432] CD8 T cell adaptive immune response compared to patients 
with severe disease. 
Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a macrolide produced by [CONTACT_627670][INVESTIGATOR_823135]-12 and binds to and inhibits the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Sirolimus is primarily used as an immunosuppressive agent to prevent rejection in organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. However, in contrast to its role as an immunosuppressive agent in the renal transplant population, sirolimus has been demonstrated to exert an immunostimulatory effect on CD8 T lymphocytes in response to viral infections. In addition, sirolimus has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the replication of a variety of different viral pathogens, including a related coronavirus, MERS-CoV. In a single center trial, the addition of sirolimus to standard of care treatment resulted in faster viral clearance and improved oxygenation in critically ill patients with H1N1 influenza. Inhibiting the mTOR pathway has been shown to reduce mortality in a murine influenza model, upregulate antiviral gene expression, and boost the response to influenza vaccination in elderly patients. Lastly, a recently conducted pharmacology network analysis has suggested mTOR inhibition as a potentially useful strategy in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Study 
OverviewThe main objective of our study is to determine if treatment with sirolimus can 
improve clinical outcomes in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19. We will employ a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study design. 30 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive sirolimus or placebo. Sirolimus will be given as a 6mg oral loading dose on day 1 followed by 2mg daily for a maximum treatment duration of 14 days or until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], whichever happens sooner. Chart reviews will be conducted daily to determine changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters. Study specific biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, 7 and 14. 
Sample Size In a study evaluating 201 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 in China, 82% (165 
patients) required supplemental oxygen. Among the patients needing supplemental oxygen, 40% (67 patients) progressed to require advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823139]. Considering the fact that our study inclusion criteria mandates the need for supplemental oxygen and the presence of at least one additional poor prognostic biomarker, we anticipate that 50% of our control group will progress to require advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823140]. We expect that treatment with sirolimus will reduce the need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_456898] 25%. 
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_823141] a meaningful treatment difference in 
order to conduct a larger confirmatory trial. Given the limited data on treatment responsiveness in COVID-[ADDRESS_1141435] being p=0.25. We chose the type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1141436]. A sample size of 30 patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion in favor of sirolimus will allow us to estimate the treatment differences with 80% confidence based on a binomial two-proportion test. A two-sided test will be used since we are unsure if the treatment will have a beneficial effect in this patient population. 
Data Analysis The primary endpoint of this study is progression to respi[INVESTIGATOR_823142]. The difference in proportions of progression between the placebo and sirolimus groups and the 80% confidence interval will be calculated. If the confidence interval for the difference in proportions does not include zero, then we will conclude that the treatment difference is clinically meaningful. Considering the small sample size of our study, the significant impact of age and other pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus on overall prognosis in patients with COVID-19 cannot be accounted for in the primary analysis. Patients will be randomized according to a computer-generated 
5permuted block randomization stratified on age: <50 years, 50 - 64 years, and ≥[ADDRESS_1141437] analyses examining differences based on other prognostic factors, and concomitant medication use, such as corticosteroids, hydroxychlororquine, azithromycin etc. An intent-to-treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome.

5.4 Recruitment
After IRB and DSMB approval has been obtained, the screening and identification for subjects will be performed as described in Section 5.1. Interested individuals will be provided with detailed study information and the informed consent form (ICF). After they have had a chance to review the study procedures and the ICF, and after ensuring that all questions are answered, patients can be enrolled into the study. Details of the informed consent process are provided in Section 6.3. 
5.5 Study Drug Treatment
Patients who meet eligibility criteria, provide informed consent and are enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive sirolimus or placebo in a double-blind manner and a 2:[ADDRESS_1141453]. The study drug will be provided by [CONTACT_59919], [COMPANY_007], encapsulated and dispensed by [CONTACT_139821]’s Investigational Drug Services (IDS) Pharmacy, and given to the patients by [CONTACT_823181]. Patients will be reminded about the side effects of sirolimus. Every attempt will be made to give the medication at the same time every day. Chart reviews will be conducted on a daily basis to determine changes in clinical status, concomitant medications and laboratory parameters. Study specific biomarkers will be measured at baseline and then at days 3, [ADDRESS_1141454]. In case a patient progresses to require advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], the study drug can continue as scheduled at the discretion of the treating clinician(s). If deemed clinically necessary on a case-by-case basis, in these scenarios the patient may need to be withdrawn ± unblinded. 
All study procedures will take place after obtaining informed consent. Details of the informed 
consent process are provided in Section 6.3. Prior to starting study drug, baseline demographic and clinical variables will be collected along with vital signs, amount of supplemental oxygen required, laboratory biomarkers such as absolute lymphocyte count, ferritin, LDH, and d-dimer, renal and liver function tests, concomitant medications, past medical history, and results of the chest imaging. After study initiation, chart reviews will be conducted on a daily basis to assess vital signs, changes to concomitant medications, lab values, and oxygenation indices. Study-specific biomarkers: absolute lymphocyte count, serum ferritin, d-dimer and LDH will be measured at Day 3, 7 and 14 following study initiation, unless already checked clinically in the 24 hours prior to the testing time.

and proceed with the steps outlined above. Prior to obtaining signatures, we will explicitly solicit any questions from the subject and ensure that all questions have been answered to their satisfaction. 
After obtaining informed consent, we will review the inclusion/exclusion criteria to 
determine study eligibility. For patients who provide informed consent and meet all eligibility criteria, the screening visit can be their initial study visit. We anticipate that in most patients the 
22screening visit will be the initial study visit, and the following additional steps will be completed 
during the visit:
•Review medical history 
•Record current medications 
•Record vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature as specified in Section 6.2
•Record baseline oxygenation indices: oxygen saturation and FiO 2 as specified in Section 
6.2
•For women of childbearing potential, obtain a urine pregnancy test, if not already obtained 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain measurements for 
study specific biomarkers: LDH, ferritin, d-dimer, and absolute lymphocyte count
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain other laboratory 
parameters: CBC (total WBCs, Hb, Platelets), serum creatinine, AST, and ALT
Subsequent visits 
Subjects’ medical chart will be reviewed on a daily basis after study enrollment. The following parameters will be obtained on a daily basis from chart review:
•Vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure, temperature as specified in Section 6.2
•Oxygenation indices: oxygen saturation and FiO
2 as specified in Section 6.2
•Concomitant medications
•Advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823149]
•Vital status
In addition, the following activities will be performed on days 3, 7 and 14 of the study
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain measurements for 
study specific biomarkers: LDH, ferritin, d-dimer, and absolute lymphocyte count. If COVID-19 biorepository sample obtained on the day of these tests, they can be postponed to the next day.
•If not already obtained clinically in the previous 24 hours, then obtain other laboratory 
parameters: CBC (total WBCs, Hb, Platelets), serum creatinine, AST, and ALT
•Query the patient with regards to any adverse effects from the study medication. This can 
be done remotely via telephone interview rather than in-person visit in order to minimize study staff exposure as well as preserve PPE
In case a subject is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5107] 14, every effort will be made to 
complete the day [ADDRESS_1141457] key variables such as the need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], duration of ICU status, time spent on mechanical ventilation, and vital status. 
236.4 Enrollment
Enrollment in the study will continue until the enrollment target of 30 patients is reached. This research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The potential participant will sign an ICF before undergoing any screening study procedures.  Participants who are deemed eligible for the study (see Section 6.3) will be enrolled and assigned a unique participant ID number.
6.[ADDRESS_1141458] the patient (or the patient’s caregiver(s)) to obtain medical records and other information for a period of up to two years after the patient has withdrawn from or completed the study. The purpose of this data review is to capture information including but not limited to clinical, radiographic, pathologic, laboratory and pulmonary function data, after the patient has exited the study. The rationale for future data review is that there may be long term effects of COVID-19 or the study drug, that are unknown to the investigators at this time.  
247. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]
7.1 Participant withdrawal criteria
Participants may be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:
a. The participant elects to withdraw consent from study activities.b. The participant dies.c. The participant has a serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction to the study drugc. The participant’s condition deteriorates significantly necessitating either a transfer to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) or the need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (high flow oxygen ≥ 15 
L/minute, CPAP, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation), and the treating clinician thinks it is in the best interest of the patient to be withdrawn ± unblinded. If the patient is unblinded, any open label use of sirolimus after that will be based on clinical grounds at the discretion of the treating clinician(s). The study drug (sirolimus or placebo) will continue for the maximum stipulated duration of 14 days regardless of escalation in care, unless the patient is withdrawn from the study. 
d. The participant develops a medical condition or is started on new medication(s) not previously 
mentioned in the list of prohibited medications that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may pose additional risks from participation in the study, or that may impact the quality of the data obtained from the study.
e. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it is not in the participant’s best medical interest to continue 
to participate in the study.  
7.2 Criteria for terminating the study
Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. The maximum duration of patient participation is 14 days. In the event of any death or Grade IV Serious adverse event (SAE) that is unexpected and attributable to the study agent, enrollment will be suspended, pending Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review. 
258. Study variables and measuring methods
8.[ADDRESS_1141459] review of study subjects daily throughout the study duration: heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. 
Heart rate : The average (mean) heart rate in the 24-hour time frame corresponding to a 
calendar date will be recorded as that day’s heart rate. 
Blood pressure : The average (mean) Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the 24-hour time 
frame corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s blood pressure. We anticipate MAP to be available in all subjects’ medical charts. However, in case MAP is not recorded then we will calculate it based on this formula:
MAP = [2 x (diastolic blood pressure) + 1 x (systolic blood pressure)]/3Temperature : The highest temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) in the 24-hour time frame 
corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s temperature. 
8.[ADDRESS_1141460] review of study subjects daily throughout the study duration: peripheral blood oxygen saturation and fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (FiO

Oxygen saturation : The average (mean) oxygen saturation in the 24-hour time frame 
corresponding to a calendar date will be recorded as that day’s oxygen saturation. 
FiO 2: FiO 2 (%) will be recorded if directly available from chart review such as in patients on 
ultra-high flow devices (e.g. vapotherm, optiflow etc.) or in patients on advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. For all other patients, FiO
2 (%) will be calculated based on the following conversion

8.3 Laboratory parameters
The following laboratory parameters will be obtained for our study: CBC (total WBCs, Hb, Platelets), absolute lymphocyte count, AST, ALT, serum creatinine, LDH, ferritin and d-dimer. These labs will be obtained at baseline (within 24 hours of study drug initiation) and at days 3, [ADDRESS_1141461]:
Need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] : Recorded as Yes/No and type, whether high flow 
oxygen ≥ 15 liters/minute, CPAP, non-invasive, or invasive mechanical ventilation. If a patient 
receives more than one form of advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823150], (e.g. started on non-invasive and worsens to require invasive ventilation, or extubated from invasive to non-invasive ventilation), we will designate the most advanced form of ventilation (in the above scenarios – mechanical ventilation) for that day. The ranking order for the above modes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_823151] (from most advanced to least advanced means): 1. Mechanical ventilation, 2. Non-invasive ventilation (e.g. bilevel), 3. CPAP, 4. High flow supplemental oxygen ≥ 15 L/minute. Of note, the use of CPAP employed to treat pre-existing obstructive sleep apnea 
will not count as advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. 
Duration of advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] : For patients who progress to require advanced 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], the type(s) of support and the time spent on the support (individual modes as well as cumulative, days) will be recorded. 
Vital status : The vital status (alive/deceased) will be recorded at study termination as well as at 
the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (in case that happens after the 14-day study period). For non-survivors, the time from study initiation to death will also be recorded. 
Duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (days):  will be recorded starting from the day of admission to the day 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. This parameter will only be used for analysis in patients who survive the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
279. Risks
9.[ADDRESS_1141462] common side effects attributable to sirolimus in clinical trials include stomatitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, peripheral edema, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, acneiform rash, headaches and myalgias.
28,29 Other 
less common but reported AEs from sirolimus include allergic reactions to the drug including angioedema, proteinuria, increased serum creatinine, impaired would healing, interstitial pneumonitis, and increased risk of secondary infections and malignancies such as skin cancer and lymphomas.
28 Key AEs attributable to sirolimus are summarized in the table below. It is 
worth mentioning that a large proportion of these AEs are derived from studies in renal transplant patients where patients are taking multiple immunosuppressive medications at the same time, and it is not clear if these AEs can be attributable to the use of sirolimus as a single agent.

Percentages for the incidence of a particular adverse event are derived from the FDA label and from a review of multiple clinical trials evaluating adverse effects from sirolimus.
18,28-[ADDRESS_1141464] majority of the common side effects (e.g. hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increased risk of 
malignancies) are of concern with prolonged/long-term use of sirolimus. Since our study duration is limited to [ADDRESS_1141465] given the nature of this study will be incidence of secondary infections and other organ system toxicities (pneumonitis, increased serum creatinine, decreased blood counts). We will carefully monitor for all laboratory abnormalities at baseline and on days 3, 7, and 14. We will also enquire about any possible AEs from the patients at days 1, 3, 7, and 14.
9.2 Risks of study procedures
Blood draws:  The risks of blood draws include bleeding, bruising, discomfort, fainting and 
lightheadedness infection or pain at the needle site. All research personnel and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823152]. We anticipate that most of the assessments needed as part of the study will already be obtained on clinical grounds and that the need for additional blood draws specific for this research study will be minimal. 
9.[ADDRESS_1141466] (HIPAA) guidelines, research records will be stored in a locked room identified specifically as a patient record room. All transmitting of data is done by [CONTACT_739399] (first or last). Results of any procedures or tests will also be de-identified so as to hide the true identity of patient's names or any other identifiers. On occasion, it may be necessary, for legal reasons, or for good clinical practice, for third parties such as the IRB or DSMB members to review medical records that are identified by [CONTACT_2300]. This however would be on special occasions and would not be a common occurrence. Every effort in all areas of care will be made to keep the patient's information as confidential as possible. As noted above, we will minimize risks to human subjects by [CONTACT_739400] a standard of excellence such as we had with our previous clinical trials at our site. Such standard includes active interactions between faculty and staff on a weekly formal basis, and as needed otherwise, careful attention to training of staff in procedures and their possible complications, and a philosophy of ‘patient first’ in all of our dealings. Specifically, we use only trained personnel to perform procedures. The plan to handle adverse events is described in detail in the section of data and safety monitoring plan.

However, participation in this study will provide additional data on the safety and effectiveness of sirolimus for the treatment of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19. The information learned from this research study may benefit other subjects with COVID-19, or other similar viral illnesses, in the future. Subjects who participate in the study will receive all study medications at no charge. The laboratory parameters that are obtained strictly for research purposes will not be billed to the patient or their insurance carrier(s). 
10.2 Importance of the knowledge to be gained
The knowledge gained from this study may benefit many subjects with COVID-19, and other similar viral illnesses. The information obtained may improve the scientific community's understanding of the management of COVID-19. Specifically, the study will identify the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 and thus may alter the clinical approach to patients with this and other similar viral diseases.
10.3 Benefits of Study Procedures
None.
3111. Study Drug 
11.1 Sirolimus or Placebo
Sirolimus is a macrocyclic lactone produced by [CONTACT_627670][INVESTIGATOR_361]. The chemical name [CONTACT_739416] (also known as rapamycin) is (3S,6R ,7E,9R ,10R,12R ,14S,15E ,17E,19E ,21S,23S ,26R,27R ,34aS)- 9,10,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,32,33,34, 34a-hexadecahydro-9,27-dihydroxy-3- [(1R)-2-[(1S,3R,4R)-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycyclohexyl]-1-methylethyl]-10,21-dimethoxy- 6,8,12,14,20,26-hexamethyl-23,27-epoxy-3H-pyrido[2,1-c][1,4] oxaazacyclohentriacontine-1,5,11,28,29 (4H,6H ,31H)-pentone. Its molecular formula is C51H79NO13 and its molecular weight is 914.2. The structural formula of sirolimus is: 
Sirolimus is a white to off-white powder and is insoluble in water, but freely soluble in benzyl alcohol, chloroform, acetone, and acetonitrile. Sirolimus is available for administration as an oral solution containing 1 mg/mL sirolimus. Sirolimus is also available as a white, triangular-shaped tablet containing 1 mg sirolimus, and as a yellow to beige triangular-shaped tablet containing 2 mg sirolimus. The inactive ingredients in sirolimus Oral Solution are Phosal 50  PG
® 
(phosphatidylcholine, propylene glycol, mono- and di-glycerides, ethanol, soy fatty acids, and ascorbyl palmitate) and polysorbate 80. Rapamune Oral Solution contains 1.5% - 2.5% ethanol. The inactive ingredients in sirolimus tablets include sucrose, lactose, polyethylene glycol 8000, calcium sulfate, microcrystalline cellulose, pharmaceutical glaze, talc, titanium dioxide, magnesium stearate, povidone, poloxamer 188, polyethylene glycol 20,000, glyceryl monooleate, carnauba wax, and other ingredients. The 2 mg dosage strength also contains iron oxide yellow 10 and iron oxide brown 70. 
The placebo for the tablet is lactose powder contained in a gel capsule. All tablet medication will 
be over-encapsulated to maintain the blind. The placebo for the Rapamune Oral Solution is 0.9% normal saline solution. 
11.2 Pharmacokinetics of sirolimus in humans
Absorption:  Following administration of sirolimus oral solution, the mean times to peak 
concentration (t max) of sirolimus are approximately 1 hour and 2 hours in healthy subjects and 
renal transplant patients, respectively. The systemic availability of sirolimus is low, and was 
estimated to be approximately 14% after the administration of the oral solution. In healthy subjects, the mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the tablet is approximately 
3227% higher relative to the solution. Sirolimus tablets are not bioequivalent to the solution; 
however, clinical equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2mg dose level.28 
Distribution:  The mean (± SD) blood-to-plasma ratio of sirolimus was 36 ± 18 in stable renal 
allograft patients, indicating that sirolimus is extensively partitioned into formed blood elements. The mean volume of distribution of sirolimus is 12 ± 8 L/kg. Sirolimus is extensively bound (approximately 92%) to human plasma proteins, mainly serum albumin (97%), α1-acid  
glycoprotein, and lipoproteins.
28
Metabolism:  Sirolimus is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Sirolimus is extensively 
metabolized in the intestinal wall and liver and undergoes counter-transport from enterocytes of the small intestine into the gut lumen. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase sirolimus concentrations. Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp decrease sirolimus concentrations. Sirolimus is extensively metabolized by O-demethylation and/or hydroxylation. Seven major metabolites, including hydroxy, demethyl, and hydroxydemethyl, are identifiable in whole blood. Some of these metabolites are also detectable in plasma, fecal, and urine samples. Sirolimus is the major component in human whole blood and contributes to more than 90% of the drug’s activity.
28
Elimination : After a single dose of [14C] sirolimus oral solution in healthy volunteers, the 
majority (91%) of radioactivity was recovered from the feces, and only a minor amount (2.2%) was excreted in urine. The mean ± SD terminal elimination half-life (t1 ⁄2) of sirolimus after 
multiple dosing in stable renal transplant patients was estimated to be about 62 ± 16 hours.
28
11.3 Accountability of Investigational ProductUnder Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator will maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational product(s)/intervention material(s), including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (participant-by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any investigational product(s)/intervention material(s) accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_139821]’s IDS Pharmacy located at the study site.  A dispensing log will be kept current for each participant. This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of investigational product(s)/intervention material(s) dispensed. All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for inspection by [CONTACT_4318], IRB or other appropriate monitoring bodies.

12.3.2 Dose Reduction 
Any AE of ≥ Grade 3 and attributed as possibly, probably or definitely related to sirolimus will 
result in the dose being held until the AE has resolved to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_1141472] will be withdrawn from the study. Of note, an escalation in patient’s level of care (e.g. floor to ICU) or the need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823153], unless deemed necessary for patient safety by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_823154]’s best interest to be withdrawn ± unblinded. In case the dose of study drug is altered in a subject, in order to maintain blind, a corresponding change will also be made in a placebo subject. Toxicities that may be attributable to sirolimus are listed in Sections 9.1 and 14.3.6. If 
34any of these AEs occur at grade ≤ 2, sirolimus may be continued and the AE managed with 
supportive care. For any AE with a grade ≥ 3, the rules outlined in Sections 14.2 – 14.[ADDRESS_1141473]. John’s Wort

(DSMB) and the University of Cincinnati IRB prior to study initiation.  Participant enrollment may only begin with IRB approved consent forms. This is an interventional exploratory phase II study.
14.1 Study Oversight
The Principal Investigator (PI) has primary oversight responsibility of this clinical trial. The DSMB has oversight responsibility of the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this clinical trial. The DSMB will review accrual, patterns and frequencies of all adverse events, and protocol compliance on a periodic basis. For this study the DSMB will meet once prior to study activation, and at the following subsequent times: once the study has reached 25% (7 subjects), 50% (15 subjects), 75% (22 subjects) and 100% (30 subjects) of its target enrollment. The DSMB will review the patient safety data at these meetings in an unblinded fashion to assess for participant safety. No interim analysis for efficacy will be performed. The DSMB makes recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_739344].
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_242990] (co-Investigators, research nurses, clinical trial coordinators, 
and data managers) are responsible for identifying AEs. Aggregate report - detailed by [CONTACT_926], attribution (expected or unexpected), and relationship to the study drug/study procedures – will be available for site review. 
14.2 Adverse Events
This section defines the types of AEs and outlines the procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting and ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applies the standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0. These criteria have been reviewed by [CONTACT_739404].
14.3 Definitions
14.3.1 Adverse events
An AE is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, symptom, laboratory finding, or disease that is experienced during participation in the trial. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s) or a study procedure, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s) or study procedure. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as baseline and not recorded as an AE. However, if the condition deteriorates or changes in severity at any time during the study it will be recorded and reported as an AE.  
3814.3.2 Suspected adverse reaction and adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction (AR), which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
An AR means any AE caused by a drug. ARs are a subset of all SARs for which there are 
reasons to conclude that the drug caused the event.
14.3.3 Adverse events associated with study procedures
The following clinical situations and laboratory parameters will be considered to be outside of the normal range of findings and will be recorded as AEs. These situations do not limit the PI [INVESTIGATOR_739345], associated or not with these procedures, from being recorded and reported as AEs.  
Blood draws
•Fainting/vasovagal events
•Bruising at puncture site greater than 2 cm in diameter
•Bleeding from puncture site lasting more than 5 minutes
•Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm
14.3.4 Adverse events associated with laboratory testing
The following table highlights the laboratory values that are being obtained as part of the study 
along with the reference range for normal values. While any value outside the reference range 
will be classified as abnormal, the clinical significance of those abnormal values will be 
determined based on the criteria set forth in the table. All lab values identified as clinically 
significant will be marked as an AE. The causality and attribution of the lab value to the study 
drug, as well as action items with regards to follow-up and management of laboratory values 
that are listed as clinically significant, will be adjudicated on an individual basis by [CONTACT_9154].

While the guidance above is meant to cover all laboratory values obtained during the study, we 
realize that it may not be able to cover all the unique circumstances that can arise during the 
conduct of a clinical trial. As such, in rare situations, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_823158] a lab value outside of the above guidance. We do not anticipate this situation to 
arise commonly, however, and if deviating from the above range while assigning clinical 
significance, the reason for this diversion will be clearly outlined in the subject’s study binder. 
Adverse events related to study medication will be tabulated by [CONTACT_739405] v 5.0. 
14.3.5 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a):
•Death:  A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol-defined follow-up. 
•A life-threatening event: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574], its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
•An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.
•An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
•Congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Regardless of the relationship of the AE to the study, the event will be reported per Section 
14.3.5 as an SAE if it meets any of the above definitions. 
14.3.6 Expected adverse events
Detailed information regarding adverse effects of sirolimus is provided in Section 9.1. This section lists the AEs regarded as expected for sirolimus (in alphabetical order of systems):
Cardiovascular: Peripheral edema, hypertension
Cutaneous: Acne, skin rash, mucositisGastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia General: Fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias Hematological: Anemia, thrombocytopeniaInfectious: Increased risk of infectionsLiver: Increased serum bilirubin
40Nervous system: headache
Pulmonary: pneumonitis Renal: Increased serum creatinine
14.3.7 Unexpected adverse event
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” when its nature, severity or frequency is not consistent with the information that is provided with the information in the protocol. 
14.[ADDRESS_1141480] has signed the consent form will be recorded and is reportable. Collection time for AEs and SAEs will begin after the screening visit when the consent form is signed and will continue until the end of the treatment.
Adverse events may be discovered through any of these methods:
•Electronic medical record review
•Observing the participant
•Questioning the participant, with standardized questions/procedures.
•Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant.
•An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an 
AE when determined to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_978]. Pre-specified criteria for abnormal lab values are provided in Section 14.3.4. 
14.4.2 Recording AEs
Throughout the study all identified AEs (serious and non-serious) will be recorded on all appropriate source document and AE case report forms (CRFs) regardless of their severity or relation to the study.  A complete description of all AEs will include event description, time of onset, investigator assessment of severity, relationship to study agent or procedures, time of resolution/stabilization of the event, expectedness, determination of whether the AE qualifies as a SAE, and action taken. A change in the severity of the AE will also be documented. Assessment of severity and relationship will be documented on the source documents or on the CRFs. 
14.4.[ADDRESS_1141481]:  a) it is resolved, b) participant is 
stable, c) participant is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_823159]-up is no longer needed.
If an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation is determined to be an AE, 
then the evaluation that produced the value or result can be repeated until the value or result returns to normal, or the result can be explained, or the usual standard of care does not require further follow-up, and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Non-serious expected AEs will be submitted to the DSMB in a timely fashion. The events will be 
presented in tabular form and given to the DSMB at every scheduled meeting. Study investigators are also required to fulfill all reporting requirements of their local institutions.
14.6 Grading and Attribution
14.6.1 Grading Criteria
In addition to determining whether an AE fulfills criteria for a SAE or not, the severity of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_823189] v 5.0. This document provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events.  All AEs whether or not listed in the NCI CTCAE manual will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the following standards in the NCI-CTCAE manual (A semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade):
Grade 1  = Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2  = Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc).
Grade 3  = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
Grade 4  = Life-threatening consequences; or urgent intervention indicated.
Grade 5  = Death related to AE.
14.7 Definition of Attribution
The attribution of an AE to the study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_739346]/sub-investigator. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_823160] 
42appropriate AE or SAE form. The attribution of an AE to the investigational drug or to a study 
procedure will be determined using the descriptors in the following table. For the purpose of this study, in addition to all study medications, the following procedures will be considered when determining attribution:
Code Descriptor Definition (guidelines)
UNRELATED CATEGORY 
[ADDRESS_1141482] or study intervention (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study subject’s medical record)
[ADDRESS_1141483]; there may be also an alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status and/or underlying disease
4 Probable The adverse event is likely related to study.  There is (1) an 
association between the event and the administration of study product or study intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product, and (3) the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical status and or an alternative etiology is not apparent
5 Definite The adverse event is clearly related to study.  There is (1) an 
association between the event and the administration of the study product or study intervention, (2) a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the related to the study product, and (3) causes other than the study product have been ruled out and/or the event re-appeared on re-exposure to the study product
For additional information and a printable version of the NCI-CTCAE manual, the NCI-CTCAE 
website: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html will be consulted. In a clinical trial, the study 
product\intervention will always be suspect when attributing an AE and the “unrelated” attribution will be used only when there is an undisputable or likely alternative explanation for the AE. 
14.8 SAE Reporting Criteria and Procedures
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_739348] a study staff member becomes aware of the SAE. In the absence of the PI, a physician sub-investigator will be notified. An unexpected, non-serious AE that is of Grade 3 severity or higher and study related will be recorded and reported 
43under the SAE reporting procedure. 
14.8.1 Notifying the IRB and DSMB
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_823161].  Individual or clusters of 
SAEs may be reported expeditiously to the DSMB upon determination. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_261976] (definitely not related, probably not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the AE. The DSMB Chair may request further information if necessary and possibly request changes to the protocol or consent form as a consequence of the AE. A back-up notification system will be instituted so that any delays in review by [CONTACT_739406] a specified period of time are forwarded to a secondary reviewer. 
SAE’s that are life-threatening/disabling or result in death of research participant; AND 
unexpected; AND related to the research  must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the event. The sponsor/investigator will report the event to the IRB and DSMB promptly. Investigators must report all other SAEs to the DSMB within 5 working days  (of 
learning of the event).

14.8.2 Notifying the FDA
The Investigational New Drug (IND) sponsor (PI) is responsible for the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) safety submissions as follows: The IND Sponsor for this study will handle all regulatory communications with the FDA and will be responsible to update the IND to include this trial, file all regulatory related issues including any MEDWATCH reports which will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_739349]. The IND sponsor will be responsible for submission of yearly reports and final report for this study. All DSMB recommendations will be communicated to the IND sponsor in a timely fashion. 
The following process for reporting a serious adverse event ensures compliance with the ICH 
guidelines, 21CFR §312.32. 
•Expedited safety report to the FDA applies if the adverse event is classified as one of the 
following:
oSerious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (Sections 14.3.4, 
14.3.6, and 14.7) (i.e. serious, unexpected, and related)Or
oAggregate analysis of adverse events that suggest a causal relationship to the 
study medicationsOr
oAny findings from clinical, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], pooled analysis of data pooled across 
multiple studies, published or unpublished scientific papers or any findings from animal or in vitro testing that would result in a safety-related change in the protocol, informed consent, investigator brochure or other aspects of the overall conduct of the trial will be reported.
Expedited Safety Reports must be reported by [CONTACT_739407] 15 calendar 
days; fatal or immediately life-threatening serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions must be reported within [ADDRESS_1141484] be followed up by a 15-day report.
The following types of SAEs will be reported in the IND Annual Report:
• Serious, expected, suspected adverse reactions • Serious but not a suspected adverse reaction 
45For standard reporting, the IND Sponsor or designee will file the IND Annual Report. All AEs 
(not just those requiring 24 hour reporting) will be reported in the Annual IND Report.

The PI [INVESTIGATOR_311025]. 
14.10.3 Notifying the FDA
The IND sponsor (the Study Chair) will file all adverse events per 21 CFR 312.32, whether 
expedited or part of the IND Annual Report.  The IND sponsor will be responsible for compi[INVESTIGATOR_823162].
14.10.4 Unanticipated Problems
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:
Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;
Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and
46Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems will be reported to 
the DSMB and IRB, in the following time frames:
1. Unanticipated problems that are SAEs should be reported to the IRB within 1 week of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event.
2. Any other unanticipated problem should be reported to the IRB according to the IRB’s 
reporting policies.
14.11 Data Management
All study data will be collected via systems created by [CONTACT_549683] (REDCap, an online data management software) and will comply with all applicable guidelines regarding patient confidentiality and data integrity. Data access in REDCap is password protected and limited to authorized study personnel. All paper records will be kept in secure files in locked cabinets inside locked offices with access limited to authorized study personnel. All other study specific documents and logs will be stored on computer drives hosted and protected by [CONTACT_823191]-ups. 
14.11.1 Registration
Registration of participants on this protocol will employ an interactive data system in which the clinical site (University of Cincinnati) will attest to the participant’s eligibility as per protocol criteria and obtain appropriate informed consent. IRB approval for the protocol must be obtained before accrual can occur from the clinical site.
Each participant enrolled will be assigned a local identifier by [CONTACT_66131].  This number 
can be a combination of the site identifier (location code) and a serial accession number.  Only the registering site will have access to the linkage between this number and the personal identifier of the subject.  
14.11.2 Data Entry
Data collection for this study will be accomplished with online electronic case report forms. Using encrypted communication links, on-line forms will be developed that contain the requisite data fields. 
14.11.3 Data Quality and Monitoring Measures
As much as possible data quality is assessed at the data entry point using intelligent on-line data entry via visual basic designed screen forms. Data element constraints, whether 
47independent range and/or format limitations or ‘relative’ referential integrity limitations, can be 
enforced by [CONTACT_5057]. Quality assurance reports assess data quality post-data entry. As we note, data quality begins with the design of the data collection forms and procedures and incorporates reasonable checks to minimize transcription and omission errors. Of the more important quality assurance measures are the internal validity checks for reasonableness and consistency. 
The DSMB will review data quality on an ongoing basis. A risk-based monitoring plan will be 
developed to support the study. The purposes of study monitoring are to ensure the safety and welfare of study participants and to confirm the accuracy of study data. 
An onsite monitoring visit will occur once during the conduct of the trial, with the option of 
making a second visit if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978], to address enrollment, or protocol deviation issues. The Monitoring Plan will detail the frequency and level of intensity of on-site monitoring visits. In general, the study will be monitored for all participants at a level of 100% of study data gathered for inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent procedures, AEs and unanticipated problems. The study monitor(s) will collaborate with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_739353].   
During scheduled interim remote monitoring visits, the clinical monitors will verify that the 
protocol is being followed and that data are being collected according to protocol requirements. The clinical monitor(s) will review the Study Regulatory File to determine that all required documentation is being collected and that the IRB approval for the site is current. The monitor will then verify that each participant has signed the correct version of the ICF, and that this document is filed in the participant’s source documents.  At each visit, the monitor will perform an audit of the source documents in the subject’s binder by [CONTACT_739409]. AE documentation will be checked for completeness and accuracy. At the study closeout, the monitor(s) will confirm that all data have been reviewed, all source documents have been verified, and all required documents are present in the Study Regulatory File.  
Protocol deviations and unanticipated problems will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], and the regulatory 
and monitoring staff to determine the need for corrective and preventative action (CAPA). In the event that corrective and/or preventative action is warranted, a root cause analysis will be performed and a CAPA will be completed as per institutional policy. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_739354] (i.e. Site Investigator, study team) and obtaining appropriate signatures to address the issues at hand. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_823163](s). Protocol deviations and unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB as per institutional policy.

14.12 Protocol Deviations
The practices below are consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP ICH E6) Sections:
•Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3
•Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1
•Noncompliance sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2
14.12.1 Protocol deviation Definition
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol Deviation  - Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures of a research protocol that affects the subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data constitutes a protocol violation. Changes or alterations in the conduct of the trial which do not have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data are considered non-major protocol deviations. Site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_739356]. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].
[IP_ADDRESS] Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation)  - A protocol violation is a deviation 
from the IRB approved protocol that may affect the subject's rights, safety, or well-being and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 
If the deviation meets any of the following criteria, it is considered a major protocol deviation.  
However, the lists of deviation examples that follow are not exhaustive. 
•The deviation has harmed or posed a significant or substantive risk of harm to the 
research subject.
Examples:
1. A research subject received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose.
2. A research subject met withdrawal criteria during the study but was not withdrawn3. A research subject received an excluded concomitant medication.
•The deviation compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.
Examples:
1. A research subject was enrolled but does not meet the protocol's eligibility criteria.
2. Changing the protocol without prior IRB approval, except for modification to ensure the 
49safety of study participants.
3. Inadvertent loss of samples or data.
•The deviation is a willful or knowing breach of human subject protection regulations, 
policies, or procedures on the part of the investigator(s).
Examples:
1. Working under an expi[INVESTIGATOR_739357].
2. Failure to follow federal and/or local regulations.3. Repeated minor deviations.
•The deviation is inconsistent with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s 
research, medical, and ethical principles. 
Examples:
1. A breach of confidentiality.
2. Inadequate or improper informed consent procedure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Major Protocol Deviation  - A non-major protocol deviation is any change, 
divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures of a research protocol that has not been approved by [CONTACT_823192] a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well-being, or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data. 
14.12.2 Reporting Protocol Deviations
Deviations from the protocol are not allowed. It is the responsibility of the study site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report any protocol deviations. Upon determination that a protocol deviation has occurred, the study staff will notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_823164]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_739358], per IRB regulations. Major protocol deviations will be reported to the DSMB at the regular DSMB reporting interval. 
5015. Statistical considerations
Sample size determination : In a study evaluating 201 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 in 
China, 82% (165 patients) required supplemental oxygen. Among the patients needing supplemental oxygen, 40% (67 patients) progressed to require advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823139].
[ADDRESS_1141487] one additional poor prognostic biomarker, we anticipate that 50% of our control group will progress to require advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823140]. We expect that treatment with sirolimus will reduce the need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_456898] 25%. 
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_823141] a meaningful treatment difference in order to conduct 
a larger confirmatory trial. Given the limited data on treatment responsiveness in COVID-[ADDRESS_1141488] being p=0.25.
[ADDRESS_1141489].37 A sample size of 30 
patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion in favor of sirolimus will allow us to estimate the treatment differences with 80% confidence based on a binomial two-proportion test. A two-sided test will be used since we are unsure if the treatment will have a beneficial effect in this patient population. 
Data Analysis Plan: The primary endpoint of this study is progression to respi[INVESTIGATOR_823165]. The difference in proportions of progression between the placebo and sirolimus groups and the 80% confidence interval will be calculated. If the confidence interval for the difference in proportions does not include zero, then we will conclude that the treatment difference is clinically meaningful. Considering the small sample size of our study, the significant impact of age and other pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus on overall prognosis in patients with COVID-19 cannot be accounted for in the primary analysis. Patients will be randomized according to a computer-generated permuted block randomization stratified on age: <50 years, 50 – 64 years, and ≥[ADDRESS_1141490] of the study is fully documented. Data derived from source documents will be transferred to protocol-specific CRFs. The results of all clinical and clinical laboratory evaluations will be maintained in the participant’s medical records or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_739359], as applicable.
16.[ADDRESS_1141491] up-to-date versions of the above documents as soon as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_311032].  
16.3 Permitting access to source data
The investigational site participating in this study (University of Cincinnati) will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality for the clinical and research information obtained from the participants in this clinical trial.  Medical and research records will be maintained at the study site in the strictest confidence.  However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigator, the investigational site will permit the study monitor, authorized representatives of the IRB, the FDA, and health authorities to examine (and when required by [CONTACT_1289], to copy) clinical records for the purpose of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluations of the study safety and progress. Unless required by [CONTACT_8032], only the coded identity associated with documents or with other participant data may be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530] (and all personally identifying information will be removed). Authorized representatives as noted above are bound to maintain the strict confidentiality of medical and research information that is linked to identify individuals.

the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data and accuracy of source documentation verification.  
When the CRFs are complete, they will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_978].  All discrepancies 
identified by [CONTACT_739412], and any resulting queries will be resolved with the site PIs and the CRFs will be amended as needed.
5217. Ethical considerations and compliance with good clinical practice
17.1 Statement of Compliance
This study was designed to ensure the protection of subjects according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and amendments concerning medical research in human subjects. This clinical study will be conducted using current good clinical practice (cGCP), as delineated in ICH, Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, and according to the criteria specified in this study protocol.  Before study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_4318], the IRB, as well as any other appropriate health authorities. Any amendments to the protocol or to the consent materials will also be approved by [CONTACT_311057].
17.[ADDRESS_1141493] will enter the date of the consent. The original, signed consent form will be retained with the study center’s records, and each subject will receive a copy. The ICF will provide information about the study to a prospective participant to allow for an informed decision about participation in the study. Consent materials for participants who do not speak or read English will be translated into the participants’ appropriate language.
The ICF will be revised and receive IRB approval whenever important new safety information is 
available, whenever the protocol is amended, and/or whenever any new information becomes available that may affect participation in the trial.
A copy of the ICF will be given to a prospective participant for review. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_823166].  The prospective participant will be told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. The site will document details of the informed consent process within the study records.
5318. Privacy and Confidentiality
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each 
participant will be assigned a sequential identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used during collection, storage, and reporting of participant information.
Data for this study will be received in electronic format from EPIC. Data will come from EPIC 
notes written as part of the research encounters, as well as field data collected using specific case report forms designed for this study. Field data will be collected on a stationary desktop computer using RedCap and will comply with all applicable guidelines regarding patient confidentiality and data integrity. Data access in REDCap is password protected and limited to authorized study personnel. Electronic data collected in the field will be protected from theft using whole disk encryption. During the study, data will be hosted at University of Cincinnati’s secure Data Center with regular back-ups. All paper records will be kept in secure files in locked cabinets inside locked offices with access limited to authorized study personnel. Upon completion of the study, private data will be destroyed by [CONTACT_739413]. 
5419. Publications
Publication of any data from this study must be carried out in accordance with the clinical study 
agreements. The results of the study will be reported in clinicaltrials.gov per current NIH regulations.

Statistical considerations 
Sample size determination: In a study evaluating 201 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 in China, 82% (165 patients) required supplemental oxygen. Among the patients needing supplemental oxygen, 40% (67 patients) progressed to require advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_823139].[ADDRESS_1141496] one additional 
poor prognostic biomarker, we anticipate that 50% of our control group will progress to require advanced 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_823140]. We expect that treatment with sirolimus will reduce the need for advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_456898] 25%.  The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_823141] a meaningful treatment difference in order to conduct a larger confirmatory trial. Given the limited data on treatment responsiveness in COVID-[ADDRESS_1141497] being 
p=0.25.[ADDRESS_1141498].37 A sample size of 30 patients randomized in a 2:1 fashion in favor of sirolimus will allow us to estimate the treatment differences with 80% confidence based on a 
binomial two-proportion test. A two-sided test will be used since we are unsure if the treatment will have a 
beneficial effect in this patient population. 
 Data Analysis Plan:  The primary endpoint of this study is progression to respi[INVESTIGATOR_823170]. The difference in proportions of progression between the placebo and sirolimus groups and the 80% confidence interval w ill be calculated. If the confi dence interval for the difference in proportions does 
not include zero, then we w ill conclude that the treatment difference is clinically meaningful. Considering the 
small sample size of our study, the significant impact of age and other pre-existing conditions such as diabetes 
mellitus on overall pr ognosis in patients with COVID-19 cannot be accounted for in the primary analysis. 
Patients will be ra ndomized according to a computer-generated permuted block randomization stratified on 
age: <50 years, 50 – \HDUVDQG\HDUV,QFDVHUHFUXLWPHQWODJVZHZLOODGG  external study sites. In 
such a scenario, University of Cincinnati and the facilities of the affiliated health systems UC Health, LLC and 
University of Cincinnati Physicians Company, LLC will follow the same randomization scheme. In case of other 
external sites, randomization will be stratified based on site in addition to the above-mentioned age-based 
stratification. As exploratory analysis, we will conduct analyses examining differences based on other prognostic factors and concomitant medications such as corticosteroids, hydro xychloroquine, azithromycin etc. 
An intent-to-treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome.

1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims 
The short-term goal of this project is to gain insight into specific strategies of VR-based 
rehabilitation to increase motivation and intensity for persons with PD during a cycling task.   The 
long-term goal of this study is to determine the essential elements in designing a training circuit for persons with PD to promote mobility and fitness resulting increased activity and participation. The short-term goals will be achieved through two primary aims that build upon 
the parent grant (1-2) and further refined through a mechanistic aim about the role of attention in explaining behavior in the VE (3).
We aim to build upon our work in PD and that of others in persons post stroke by [CONTACT_636560] a 
virtual environment. 
Aim 1: Determine the effect of visual feedback and competition (self or others) during virtual 
bicycling on neuromuscular (cycling cadence) and cardiovascular (% max heart rate) intensity
Hypothesis:  Competition will produce higher neuromuscular and cardiovascular intensity 
compared to feedback.
Aim 2: Determine the effect of visual-feedback and competition (self or others) during virtual 
bicycling on the user experience of motivation & enjoyment (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory: IMI) & 
perception of exercise intensity (Borg Scale)
Hypotheses: Competition will elicit a higher motivation and enjoyment compared to visual 
feedback.  Competition will result in lower perceived exertion compared to visual feedback.
Aim 3: Determine if attention differs (dwell time percentage) in augmented visual feedback 
bicycling compared to competition (self or others) virtual bicycling
Hypothesis: Attention will be higher during competition virtual bicycling when compared to 
augmented bicycling.

1.2 Research Significance (Briefly describe the following in 500 words or less)
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects over 10 million individuals
worldwide. [1] In addition to pharmacotherapy, intense (cardiovascular and neuromuscular) exercise is recommended for persons with PD. Studies investigating the positive neuroplastic effects of intense exercise in animals [2] have been extended to humans regarding improved brain connectivity and upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. [3, 4] In addition to neuroplastic effects, exercise has been shown to have positive clinical benefits in reducing PD severity and improving motor and cognitive

Page 4 of 20function in persons with PD. [4-6] Specifically, bicycling has been shown to improve balance and 
mobility and reduce both motor symptoms, and disease severity for persons with PD. [7-10] In achieving and adhering to the intensity of bicycling required to benefit from the training, factors such as the user experience of exercise, specifically motivation, [11] enjoyment, and perceived exertion need to be considered. This is important as adherence to routine exercise is challenging for persons with PD. [12, 13] One method that may enhance exercise intensity for persons with PD is bicycling augmented with a virtual environment (VE). VEs serve as an interactive context to engage the participant in the exercise task. [14] This is because VEs provide visual feedback and cueing that may drive the intensity of the exercise. Specifically, we have shown that neuromuscular cycling intensity (cadence) was increased with visual feedback in short bouts of bicycling in a VE (see Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46476]). [15] To maintain engagement for longer bouts, competition may provide an additive effect to visual feedback in the VE. 
While motor and cognitive outcomes have been documented for persons with PD interacting with 
virtual environments, [16, 17] less is known about visual attention of persons with PD during motor tasks in VEs. Though visual attention has been studied in persons with PD, [18] only a few studies have investigated visual attention in VEs. [19] To address this knowledge gap, we will be the first lab to investigate eye movements as a surrogate of attention in persons with PD during virtual reality (VR) bicycling to study a mechanistic explanation for behavioral changes.
The ultimate goal of this research is to improve the well-being of persons with PD by [CONTACT_636561]. It is significant that we bring inter-disciplinary expertise in understanding virtual environments and the demands of implementing the technology in clinical practice. By [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_636552], motivating, 
and facilitate intense exercise, we aim to remove barriers associated with exercise for persons with PD 
and improve activity and participation as well as promote a healthy lifestyle. Being a valuable adjuvant to 
pharmacotherapy in addressing the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PD, intense exercise measured by [CONTACT_636562]-being.

Page [ADDRESS_851077] 8 minutes (~24 minutes of exercise total) and will be preceded by a baseline cadence assessment. For the visual feedback condition, the cyclist will be instructed to cycle at a target cadence that will turn the road markers blue. For the competition conditions, the participant will be instructed to cycle fast enough to pass a virtual cyclist in the simulation that is pedaling at the target cadence. Measurements of cardiovascular (HR) and neuromuscular (cycling cadence) intensity and visual attention (eye-tracking data) will be recorded continuously during both cycling conditions. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) will be collected at the beginning, midpoint, and end of each condition. At the end of each cycling bout, motivation & enjoyment and simulation sickness will be assessed. Open ended questions about the experience in each condition will conclude the session. Participant safety will be carefully monitored. If the 
intensity of the exercise is too high, the cyclists may overexert themselves risking adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, different termination criteria will be implemented to ensure the safety of the patient. Participants will also be supervised at all times for safety on the bike. They will also be monitored for signs of cybersickness (dizziness, sweating) and be given an opportunity to stop at any time.
B. Data Points
See outcome table below (Table 1).
C.Duration for Study and Each Subject
The study will be conducted over [ADDRESS_851078] & enjoyment, perceived competence, and value & usefulness. Participants also bicycled at a moderate-high intensity, indicated by [CONTACT_102836] % HR Max of >55% and a bicycling cadence that was >30% faster than their comfortable baseline cadences. 
There are many parallels between the parent study and this project. In particular, we have demonstrated our ability to recruit, screen, and clinically test persons with PD.  Furthermore, we have collected time series of heart rate and bicycling cadence data during exercise for persons with PD.

Page 6 of 201.5 Sample Size Justification
Power analyses- Sample size for Aim 1: An a priori power analysis was powered upon preliminary cycling 
cadence data published from the lab. [15] The power analysis conducted in G*Power, [20] determined that 19 participants would be required to reach a power level of 0.80 (Cohen’s D =0.7, moderate effect size). Aim 2: An a priori power analysis powered on motivation and enjoyment (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory) [21] with an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_851079] size was adapted from Cikajilo & Potisk 2019, who investigated a fine motor upper extremity task for persons with PD in a fully-immersive environment. We used their reported average effect size of the different IMI subscales. [22] Aim 3: There are no pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (collected by [CONTACT_636563]) for this aim. An effect size will be calculated from these data to power future studies. Considering all the sample size calculations and accounting for a 20% attrition rate, 24 participants will be required for this study.

participants will also be screen using the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), [25] which has been validated in persons with PD. [26] Participants with a score of 9 or more on the GDS-15 (indicating moderate depression) will be excluded.  Once cleared, participants will be asked to take their medications as normal. Testing will be scheduled at peak medication, approximately 2 hours after administration.  
Baseline Assessments: Participants will complete a questionnaire about personal factors 
including age, gender, previous VR use and competitiveness. Competitiveness will be measured 
with a validated 12-item inventory. [27]  Disease severity will be assessed with the motor subscale of the UPDRS (UPDRS-III). [28] The simulation sickness questionnaire (SSQ) will be collected at baseline and at the end of the final trial to monitor cybersickness. [29]
Familiarization: Participants will don the HMD and bicycle in the three different conditions until 
they execute each cycling task correctly and are accustomed to the HMD and understand the 
Borg Scale. After familiarization, there will be a brief period of rest to restore HR to baseline.
Cycling Conditions Baseline cycling cadence will be established for each condition. Participants will cycle at a 
comfortable pace that can be maintained for 30 minutes. This comfortable baseline pace will be 
used to set the target cadence (rate at which the visual markers are presented or rate of the virtual competitive cyclist) for participants during the given trial. The target cadence will be set at a pace that is 25% higher than comfortable baseline pace. [10, 15]
Visual Feedback Condition: The cyclist will be instructed to cycle at a pace that will turn the 
road markers blue. If the cyclist pedals at a speed that is below the target cadence, the markers will remain white. If the cyclist cycles at a pace that is above the target cadence the markers will turn from white to blue, serving as visual feedback for the user to maintain the pace. If the cyclist pedals too fast (threshold set at 40% greater than the comfortable baseline RPM), the road markers will turn from blue to red, serving as visual feedback for the user to slow down. The participant will also receive summary information at fixed time intervals about how well they are maintaining their cadence in the target range. Explicit instructions will be provided to the user before the trial begins.
Competition Condition (Other): The virtual cyclist will be referred to as a virtual agent, since the 
cyclist is not being controlled by [CONTACT_636565]. [30] Once the 8-minute trial begins, the participant will be instructed to cycle fast enough to pass the virtual agent travelling at their target cadence. If the cyclist passes the virtual agent, another agent will appear further ahead on the road (travelling at the target cadence) in order to maintain the competitive effect of this cycling task. The goal of the activity is to pass as many virtual agents as possible can within the 8-minute condition.

Page 9 of 20Competition Condition (Self): This condition is similar to the other competition condition.  
However, participants will be instructed that the virtual agent represents their best time. Therefore, the condition is framed as self-competition as the goal is to perform better than their best time by [CONTACT_636566]. Since the conditions are counter-balanced, if this condition occurs first, participants will be informed that the other virtual agents are modelled after an estimation of their best time using data from familiarization. Importantly, the timescale of visual information presentation will be identical across the three cycling conditions (all responding instantaneously to deviations from the target intensity).
Measurements: Measures of cardiovascular (HR) and neuromuscular (cycling cadence) intensity 
and visual attention (eye-tracking data) will be recorded continuously during both cycling conditions. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) will be collected at the beginning, midpoint, and end of each condition. Each condition will last 10 minutes [10] and will be followed by [CONTACT_636567] (IMI) [21, 31] and simulation sickness using the SSQ. (Figure 1 )
Participant Safety: will be carefully monitored. If the intensity of the exercise is too high, the cyclists may overexert themselves risking adverse cardiovascular events. Therefore, different termination criteria will be implemented to ensure the safety of the patient (i.e. if RPE > 16 and HR > 80% MaxHR, the experiment will be terminated). These criteria are based on ACSM guidelines for exercise termination. [32]
Timing and Frequency: Data will be collected in a single session lasting ~3 hours.
Procedures for Audio/Visual Recording: Participants will be recorded during the debriefing 
at the conclusion of each data collection session. These data will subsequently be used to 
analyze the qualitative data. The consent language was incorporated into the consent form. Study Instruments: 
Data are collected with known validated instruments (see outcomes table). 
Ethnographic Studies, Interviews, Or Observation: The semi-structured interviews will be 
audio-recorded and transcribed. The data will be loaded into NVivo 12 (QSR International) for content analysis. Since the interviews will verify and add depth to the survey findings, we will use a combination of conventional and directed content analysis. [33] These content analysis procedures include coding transcripts to identify key concepts as initial coding categories, developi[INVESTIGATOR_636553], and then identifying and labeling patterns and themes.  We will verify categories, operational definitions, and themes through team coding and discussion.

Page 14 of 20A. Description of Risks of Harm to Subjects
Reasonably Foreseeable Risks of Harm
The training studies are non-invasive and pose minimal risk to the participants. They may experience occasional fatigue of the lower extremities. We are using one virtual reality simulation that will be displayed through a head mounted display. This may pose a small risk for nausea or dizziness or present with sweatiness and fatigue. 
Risk of Harm from an Intervention on a Subject with an Existing Condition: NAWe are aware that participants with PD in the study are more likely than the other participants to have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to adverse medical events directly related to the potential symptoms of nausea or dizziness. Certain other conditions, though not necessarily caused by [CONTACT_4002], are much more common in people with PD than in the general population, including depression, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue. For this reason, we have included a screen for depression. Persons with PD who present with moderate depression will be excluded. They will be referred to behavioral services for support.
Other Foreseeable Risks of Harm: NA
Observation and Sensitive Information: NA
B. Procedures which Risk Harm to Embryo, Fetus, and/or Pregnant Subjects: NAC. Risks of Harm to Non-Subjects: NA
D. Assessment of Social Behavior Considerations: NA
E. Minimizing Risks of HarmIt is unlikely that they will lose their balance on the bicycle. A physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_636555]’s balance. We are using virtual reality simulations that will be displayed through a head mounted display. This may pose a small risk for nausea or dizziness or present with sweatiness and fatigue. These symptoms will be monitored, and we are prepared to stop data collection to allow participants to return to their baseline physiology.  Importantly, it will be clearly explained to participants that they may discontinue bicycling at any point in which they experience nausea or dizziness or feel hot. Ample time will be given to participants between cycling bouts in the event that they develop symptoms. They will be offered an opportunity to sit comfortably with low lighting and given something to drink.
Certificate of ConfidentialityTo be issued automatically because this is a NIH funded study.
This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. This means that the researchers cannot release or use information, documents, or samples that may identify you in any action or suit unless you say it is okay. They also cannot provide them as evidence unless you have agreed. This protection includes federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. An example would be a court subpoena. There are some important things that you need to know. The Certificate DOES NOT stop reporting that federal, state or local laws require, such as laws that require reporting of child or elder abuse, some communicable diseases, and threats to harm yourself or others. The Certificate CANNOT BE USED to stop a sponsoring [LOCATION_002] federal or state government agency from checking records or evaluating programs. The Certificate DOES NOT stop disclosures required by [CONTACT_459194] (FDA). The Certificate also DOES NOT prevent your information from being used for other research if allowed by [CONTACT_17926]. Researchers may release information about you when you say it is okay. For

A. Data/Safety Monitoring Plan
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_636558], check actual participant files for recording accuracy, and 
monitor data entry for accuracy, including random checks throughout the duration of the study.
The research team will periodically evaluate the data collected regarding harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe. Specifically, we will review the response to exercise (% of max heart rate and rate of perceived exertion) and the reports on the SSQ Cybersickness Questionnaires for every participant. This will be done by [CONTACT_636569]. At monthly research study meetings, we will discuss these variables. Minutes from the monthly safety minutes will serve to document this process.  Any follow-ups with specific participants will be added to the monthly documentation. Any adverse events will be reported immediately to the IRB at both Rutgers and NYIT. Rutgers and NYIT will have a health monitor to verify the adherence to safety. Data monitoring will be overseen by [CONTACT_636570].

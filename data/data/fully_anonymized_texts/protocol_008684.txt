The same measures will be assessed again at 1 hour and 2 hours after the 
injection of the antihistamine (IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine), and at the Time of “Readiness for Discharge.” At these same time intervals, 
participating patients will be asked to self -rate (recorded by [CONTACT_464]) any 
symptom and their level of sedation. The patient’s responses will be recorded 
by [CONTACT_093]/designee on the designated outcome measure form 
(Electronic Medical Record). All rescue medication, e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
bronchodilators, steroids, will be recorded. In addition, Health Care Provider (HCP)/Staff will evaluate overall satisfaction with time spent during treatment, at 2 hours, and ease of discharge.
 
The actual time at which the inves tigator or designee determines the patient is 
physically and mentally fit to be discharged from the center (Time of 
“Readiness for Discharge”) will be recorded in the source documents. The 
decision to discharge the patient (Time of “Readiness for Discharge”) could be 
made at any time after the 2 -hour assessment of study outcome measures 
provided the following criteria are met: 
1. No symptoms of hypersensitivity infusion reaction
2. Patient is alert enough (sedation scores = 0) to understand Discharge
Instructions
3. Based on the investigator’s judgment, the patient is fit to be discharged
Before discharge, patients will be instructed on the procedures they should 
follow when experiencing an adverse event (AE) or serious adver se event 
(SAE). They will be instructed to expect a follow-up phone call from a 
member of the site staff at approximately the same time the following day 
(i.e., 24 hours later) who will ask them a few short questions regarding allergic 
symptoms. 
All AEs an d SAEs that are reported after the patient signs an informed consent 
form (ICF) will be recorded in the source documents and captured in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  Up to [ADDRESS_519401]–IV study drug 
injection, patient self -reported AEs and SAEs will also be included in the

Methods A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) with analytical details and assumptions will be developed and finalized before database lock and unblinding of the study data.  
No formal statistical analyses are planned given the exploratory objectives of the study.  
Primar
y Endpoints:  
The primary clinical endpoint is incidence of hypersensitivity infusion reactions (ﬂushing, itching, alterations in heart rate and blood pressure , 
dyspnea, chest discomfort, acute back or abdominal pain, fever, shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, throat tightening, hypoxia, seizures, dizziness, or syncope). 
Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints will be to document the saf ety of IV cetirizine HCl 
and to capture additional process- related data, as follows. Sedation score and 
Readiness for Discharge endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_411855] (PP) analysis set. All other endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_411856] (SAS). 
1. Sedation scores (patient and HCP) at [ADDRESS_519402]- injection
of antihistamine (IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine). The
patient sedation scores are assessed on a scale of 0 -4, with 0=None and
4=Extremely Severe (Asleep, Cannot Self -Rate). The HCP sedation
scores are assessed on a scale of 0 -4, with 0=None and 4=Extremely
severe.
2. Hypersensitivity infusion reactions at [ADDRESS_519403]- injection
of antihistamine (IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine).
3. Document the percentage of patients requiring rescue medication, e.g.,
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, or steroids.
4.Describe the reasons for the use of rescue drugs.
5. Document the AEs and SAEs per study group.
6.Describe the distribution of the amount of time spent in the treatment
center prior to discharge (time from injection to “Readiness forDischarge”).
7. Document the percentage of patients receiving additional medication,
e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_411844] a fter discharge.

Safety:  
Safety analyses will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_411858] (SAS). Sedation score will be analyzed 
descriptively by [CONTACT_411859] (PP) analysis set. Adverse events wil l be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) coding dictionary 22.1 and will be summarized by [CONTACT_411860], seriousness,  and relationship. Events occurring more than once in 
the same patient will be counted only once. Additional safety analyses include 
summarizing vital signs and physical exam findings descriptively by [CONTACT_6490]. 
Sample Size Considerations:  
This is an exploratory clinical study to determine process feasibilities and to obtain a baseline clinical response to IV cetirizine HCl and IV diphenhydramine on the primary and secondary clinical outcome measures. As 
such, no sample size will be calculated for this study. However, the data 
obtained from this study might be used to calculate the sample size of future studies.

Cetirizine, a human metabolite of hydroxyzine, is an antihistamine. Cetirizine hydrochloride 
(HCl) is available as an orally administered over -the-counter product indicated for the treatment 
of acute urticaria in adults and children [ADDRESS_519404] 24 years, the safety 
profile with cetirizine HCl used chronically has been well established in both children (6 months 
and older) and adults. 
Intravenous c etirizine HCl  10 mg/mL  (QUZYTTIRTM)1 was developed to provide a faster or 
immediate -onset treatment profile over the current 10 mg  cetirizine HCl  products (Zyrtec®) to 
alleviate acute symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, and a llergic reactions . Cetirizine HCl is 
to be injected IV at  a dose of 10 mg  in adults. 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (ETTAU-02) was  conducted in  33 patients and demonstrated that the 
investigational drug, IV cetirizine HCl, was not significantly different (and slightly in favor of 
cetirizine) from the active comparator, diphenhydramine injection, in acute urticaria symptom 
score reductions (composite score and each individual symptom score, such as: pruritus and extent of urticaria/erythema) at [ADDRESS_519405]- injection an d at discharge. T here were no 
serious adverse events (SAEs) in either  treatment arms. There were no drug -related adverse 
events (AEs) from the cetirizine HCl arm, but several drug- related AEs were recorded in patients 
in the diphenhydramine arm. 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] P hase 3 study ( ETTAU -03) in  262 patients demonstrated similar results as in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] ( ETTAU -02). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_411846]-
inferior to IV diphenhydramine on the primary endpoint (2 -hour patient -rated pruritus score 
change from baseline), and improvement on two key secondary endpoints (time spent in 
treatment center, and  % of patients returned to treatment center) . Intravenous c etirizine HCl was 
also better  on several other secondary endpoints such as  fewer  AEs, less sedation, reduced 
rescue -drug usage, and higher rate of effective treatment . 
Pretreatment with antihistamine s for drug-induced hypersensitivity is recommended for 
biologics, chemotherapy drugs, and other treatments. Hypersensitivity infusion reactions occur in approximately 5% of patients treated with chemotherapy.
[ADDRESS_519406] a greater potential of causing these reactions. For those with high potential, pretreatment is recommended with an antihistamine  and corticosteroids prior to 
treatment. Severe infusion reactions may require oxygen, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], and cardiovascular 
support .
3  
Currently , the only injectable antihistamine is diphenhydramine; however , it is not indicated  for 
pretreatment.[ADDRESS_519407] been provided with 
guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network  and the European Society for 
Medical Oncology.5,6 Intravenous c etirizine HCl 10 mg/mL has been shown to treat acute 
urticaria as effectively  as diphenhydramine with fewer  side effects, and can  be used for 
pretreatment for chemotherapy -induced infusion reactions. 
TerSera Therapeutics LLC  Cetirizine HCl IV, 10 mg/mL  
Protocol TER -QZTR -001 Version  4.0 Date: November 24, [ADDRESS_519408] been used for pretreatment to prevent hypersensitivity infusion reactions.2,7 The use of oral 
antihistamine s has limitation s; oral cetirizine HCl  has a time to maximum concentration (T max) of 
1 hour with a delay of T max with food to 1.7 hours (Zyrtec PI8).  
There is an unmet medical need for injectable pretreatment antihistamines for use with drugs that 
cause infus ion reactions (e.g., biologic chemotherapy) . Current literature shows that a second -
generation, less -sedating antihistamine such as IV cetirizine HCl could be a viable and clinically 
meaningful option for patients. Intravenous c etirizine HCl 10 mg/mL has been shown to treat 
acute urticaria as effectively  as diphenhydramine with fewer side effects and  could be used for 
pretreatment for chemotherapy -induced infusion reactions.

This will be a parallel -group, randomized, double-blind exploratory study of IV cetirizine HCl  
10 mg/mL  versus IV diphenhydramine 50 mg /mL in approximately 34 patients who will receive  
premedication for hypersensitivity infusion reactions associated with an anti -CD20 , such as 
Rituxan® (rituxima b) or paclitaxel.  
The objectives and purpose of the study will be described to patients presenti ng at the 
participating infusion centers.  If a patient  agrees to participate in the study, an informed consent 
form (ICF) will be signed by [CONTACT_411861]. The screening period could be up to 14 days prior to 
randomization/treatment. After consent is received, the study investigator or designee will verify 
all inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure patient eligibility and capture all baseline data such 
as vital signs  (including temperature) , weight, height, age, previous medical history, and prior 
medication use, including all medication taken prior to coming to the facility. Once these data

diphenhydramine. The time that the study medication was administered will be recorded in the 
source documents and  in the eCRF.  
During the Baseline/ Screening period ( Day -14 to Day 0), the study investigator or designee will 
record the following baseline data: medical history, vital signs  (including temperature), physical 
exam ination, and concomitant medication.  
On Antihistamine injection Day (Day 0), before the patient receive randomized antihistamine injection  (Study drug), the investigator or designee will record the following information: vital 
signs (including temperature), Sedation score, Concomitant medication, and Adverse events - Other than infusion reaction.
  
During the infusion and afterwards, the study investigator or designee will record each of the events of an infusion reaction: ﬂushing, itching (pruritus), urticaria, alterations in heart rate and 
blood pressure, dyspnea, chest discomfort, acute back or abdominal pain, fever, shaking chills, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, throat tightening, hypoxia, seizures, dizziness, syncope, or other. The study investigator will assess if the event is related to the Rituxan ( rituximab ) or 
paclitaxel infusion and record the event. 
The infusion reactions will be managed following the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE  version 5.0) definition of graded infusion reactions* or clinical site

compromising their clinical management. The investigator also has the right to withdraw patient s 
from the study if he/she feels it is in the best interest of the patient , or if the patient  is 
uncooperative or non- compliant.  
Reasons for discontinuation include: 
•Violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria found after the study medication has been
administered .
•The investigator, patient, or the healthcare professional performing as sessments become
unblinded to the study medication for whatever reason .
•The investigator decides that the patient should be withdrawn. If this decision is made
because of an SAE , the study drug is to be discontinued and appropriate measures are to
be taken . The investigator will notify the Sponsor immediately .
•Administrative decision by [CONTACT_411863]. All patients will bediscontinued from the protocol and notified of the reason for the discontinuation.
•The patient may withdraw from the study for any other reason, including withdrawal ofconsent.
An excessive rate of withdrawal can make the study results difficult to interpret. 
The reason for any discontinuation will be fully documented on the s ource document and  eCRF.  
Should a patient decide to withdraw, every effort will be made to complete and report all study 
observations, particularly the 24-hour follow-up, as thoroughly as possible ( Attachment C ). The

A drug dispensing log will be kept current and will contain the following information: 
•The identification of the patient to whom the drug was dispensed.
•The date, quantity, and lot number of the drug dispensed to the patient .
Drug inventory and accountability records (Test Article Accountability Log) will be maintained 
at the site. A monitor will reconcile drug inventory and review accountability records. Any 
unused vials of study drug will be  collected by [CONTACT_411866]. Study 
drugs may be stored at room temperature.  
7.2. Method of Assignment to Treatment 
Approximately 34 patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Specifics 
for the randomization scheme and blinding plan will be described  in the Statistical Analysis P lan 
(SAP) for the study . Study medication/Investigational Product (IP  will be sent to each study site  
depending on the recruiting capabilities  of each site. At the investigational site, ea ch subject will 
be entered in EDC with a subject ID in the format of ##-###, where the first [ADDRESS_519416] 3 digits represent a sequential patient number ( i.e., 02-009 represents the 
ninth patient consented at site two).  
Upon verification that all eligibility criteria are met the subject can be randomi zed within EDC. 
The site will be provided with a blinded treatment code that corresponds to appropriate drug 
label.  
7.3. Rationale for the Control Product and Doses of Study Medication  
Investigational Product:  IV cetirizine HCl , a single 1- mL injection (10 mg /mL) given by [CONTACT_411867] a period of [ADDRESS_519417]:  IV diphenhydramine, a single 1- mL injection (50  mg/mL) given by [CONTACT_411867] a period of [ADDRESS_519418]  
Intravenous diphenhydramine is the only antihistamine injection available currently for the 
treatment of reducing the incidence of infusion induced reaction. 
 The approved indication for IV diphenhydramine is as follows: 
For amelioration (improvement) of allergic reactions to blood or plasma, in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epi[INVESTIGATOR_411849], and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral 
therapy is impossible or contraindicated.

Page 23 of 39 7.3.2. Rationale for Selection of the Dose of IV C etirizine HCl   
The recommended dose of oral cetirizine HCl  is 10 mg  (Zyrtec). This dose has been shown to 
strongly inhibit the w heal and flare caused by [CONTACT_62363]. The onset 
of this activity after a single 10  mg dose occurs within 20 minutes in 50% of patients  and within 
one hour in 95% of patients . 
Intravenous
 cetirizine HCl was demonstrated to be non-inferior to diphenhydramine injection for 
acute urticaria while in a treatment center, but was demonstrated to be better in the  benefits of: 
less sedation, less rescue-drug usage, shorter time spent in the treatment center, longer duration 
of action, lower return rate to the treatment centers, less symptom recurrence post-discharge, 
fewer  AEs, lack of anticholinergic effect, and no significant drug-drug interactions. 
7.3.3. Study Medication  
Intravenous cetirizine HCl  10 mg/mL has been shown to treat acute urticaria as effectively  as 
diphenhydramine with fewer  side effects and  could be used for pretreatment of chemotherapy -
induced infusion reactions. Pretreatment for infusion reactions includes antihistamines where IV 
diphenhydramine is given as currently the only available injectable antihistamine. IV C etirizine 
HCl, a second -generation injectable antihistamine , provides a new option for patients.  
7.3.4. Maintenance of Study Blind  
This will be a do uble-blind study; the investigator, the patient, and any healthcare professional 
involved in patient management or outcome assessment will remain blinded. Both IV cetirizine

drug cetirizine HCl or the comparator diphenhydramine). In the event of an emergency, patient 
and site may be unblinded. 
7.3.5. Breaking the Study Blind  
In order to preserve the blinding of the study, site personnel will not have access to the 
randomization list and treatment assignments before database lock. Study blinding may only be 
broken if the identity of the study drug is considered vital for the cl inical management  or to 
ensure safety of the patients . 
7.3.6. Concomitant Medications/Rescue Drugs  
To ensure optimal patient management, additional medications, e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_411844], may be given at any time during the study if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. However, if without medical complication, all effort should be made to have the patient complete at least the 1-hour assessments prior to administration of the rescue medication.
The product label of the rescue drugs should be followed to determine the appropriate dose.
The identity, dose, frequency, and route of administration of all medications being taken prior to 
study enroll ment will be recorded, as well as all concomitant medications administered during 
the study. 
7.4. Clinical and Safety Evalu ations  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Study Schedule in Attachment A  and 
Symptom Score A ssessment in Attachment B .
All patients  who received at least 1 dose of study medication will be included in the PP and SAS 
analyses and safety evaluations .

•Possible : Any adverse event that  can be caused by [CONTACT_62368],
but for which another explanation can be found – for example, the existence of a
concomitant treatment or concurrent disease(s) – or for which the relation in time is not
obvious.
•Probable : Any adverse event that  can be caused using the product being studied. The
relationship in time is suggestive (for example, if the event disappears when the treatment
is interrupted). Another explanation is less probable – for example, the existence of a
concomitant treatment or concurrent disease(s).
•Not assessable : It is impossible to attribute the event to any of the categories above,
because the information obtained is insufficient, incomplete, or contradictory. Additional
information is necessary to determine the causal relationship with the product beingstudied.
If a patient  is discontinued as a result of an AE , study site personnel must clearly document the 
circumstances leading to any such discontinuation of treatment, in the source document and on the eCRF.  
Events leading to a study endpoint will be included as part of the safety and efficacy analyses for this study and will not be recorded as AE  or SAE  unless the investigator believe s the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257]. The primary endpoint is the i ncidence of hypersensitivity 
infusion reactions (ﬂushing, itching, alterations in heart rate and blood pressure, dyspnea, chest discomfort, acute back or abdominal pain, fever, shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin

diphenhydramine injection on the primary and secondary clinical outcome measures. As such, no sample size was calculated for this study. However, the data obtained from this study may be used to calculate the sample size of future studies.  
11.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) with analytical details and assumptions will be developed and finalized before database lock and unblinding of the study data. 
11.2.1. Analysis Populations 
Patients with baseline Sedation Score greater than [ADDRESS_519426] taken a sedating concomitant or 
other medication. It may be impossible to confirm that patients did not take a sedating 
medication prior to receiving treatment. Sedation Score greater than 0 would be a confounding factor and may invalidate the results of endpoints of Sedation score and Readiness for Discharge. 
Therefore, these two endpoints will only be analyzed by [CONTACT_411875] 0. 
The following analysis populations will be identified for this study: 
•Full Analysis Set (FAS) : The FAS consists of all randomized patients . Patients  will be
analyzed according to the randomized treatment.
•Safety Analysis Set (SAS) : The SAS consists of all patients  who received at least 1 dose
of study medication. Patients  will be analyzed according to the treatment actually

All presentations and analyses will be conducted using SAS version 9.4 or higher, unless 
otherwise specified . For continuous data, the number of observations (n), mean, median, 
minimum,  and maximum, and standard deviation (SD) values will be presented. For categorical 
data, the f requency counts and percentages will be presented.  
11.2.3. Patient  Disposition  
Patient disposition (e.g., the number of patients signing the informed consent, randomized, completed, and discontinued) along with the number of patients in each of the analysis populations will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].  
11.2.4. Patient Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize pa tient demographics and baseline 
characteristics such as medical and surgical history by [CONTACT_1570]. Additionally, 
demographics will be presented for screen failure subjects. 
11.2.5. Concomitant Therapy 
The frequency of medications taken prior to study enrollm ent and while enrolled in the study 
(concomitant medications) will be summarized using descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_1570]. 
11.2.6. Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the i ncidence of hypersensitivity infusion reactions (ﬂushing, itching, 
alterations  in heart rate and blood pressure, dyspnea, chest discomfort, acute back or abdominal 
pain, fever, shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, throat tightening, hypoxia, 
seizures, dizziness, or syncope). 
The number and percent of patients experiencing hypersensitivity infusion reactions will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_411876] . This analysis will be 
performed using the FAS population.  
11.2.7. Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints will be to document the safety of IV cetirizine HCl  and to capture 
additional process- related data, as follows. Sedation score and Readiness for Discharge 
endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_411877]. 
All other endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by [CONTACT_411878] (SAS). 
1. Sedation score s (patient and HCP)  at [ADDRESS_519428]- injection of antihistamine
(IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine). The patient  sedation scores are assessed on a
scale of 0 -4, with 0=None and 4= Extremely Severe (Asleep, Cannot Self -Rate) . The HCP
sedation scores are assessed on a scale of 0 -4, with 0=None and 4 =Extremely severe.

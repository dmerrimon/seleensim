Appendix H1 -1 
 Appendix H1: LY3819253  (LY-CoV555)  – version 1.0 (16th July 2020)  
 
The content of this appendix is confidential and should only be viewed 
by [CONTACT_541200] -3 study.   
 
This appendix provides detailed information pertaining to the study of this investigational 
agent. If not stated otherwise, the text in the master protocol gives  the approach that will 
be taken to study this agent.    
H.1.1. Introduction and rationale for studying the agent  
LY3819253  is a neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) -1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to  
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein of SARS -CoV-2 being developed 
as a potential treatment and prophylaxis for  COVID -19. This antibody blocks S protein 
attachment to human angiotensin -converting  enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, preventing 
subseque nt viral entry into human cells and viral  replication. This is expected to result 
in a clinically important decrease in viral replication,  mitigating the severity of disease in 
patients in who ongoing viral replication is an important driver of COVID -19 
pathophysiology .  
 
LY3819253 is made by [CONTACT_541201], Eli Lilly and Company, in 
partnership with AbCellera Biologics  Inc. (AbCellera; Vancouver, Canada) , and is 
derived from a person , who recovered from SARS -CoV-2 infection.  
 
Whereas one antiviral agent (remdesivir ) has been demonstrated to have clinical 
benefit in the target population for this trial  and is now part of standard -of-care (see 
Appendix I), it is plausible that additional antiviral effects from LY3819253 in 
combin ation with the antiviral agent may provide additive , if not synergistic , antiviral 
effects and hence , contribute to improvement in time to sustained recovery .  
 
Lilly is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of LY3819253 in participants hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -19, in a 
randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, sponsor -unblinded, single -ascending -
dose, Phase 1, first in human study (Study J2W-MC-PYAA [PYAA])  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (1). Lilly is also evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of 
LY3819253 in a phase 2 , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose ranging 
study in non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541194] -19 Illness  (Study 
J2W-MC-PYAB [ BLAZE -1]) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (2). Both studies a re ongoing and 
preliminary  safety, tolerability , PK and PD data from the se may inform the dose level 
administered in this study.  
  
H1.1.1 Potential risk and benefits from LY3819253  
Anticipated risk is considered low , based on the known mechanism of action for human 
derived neutralizing antibodies in acute viral disease states.  LY3819253  is a highly 
specific mAb directed at foreign (non -human) epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230](s).  The complementarity 
determining regions (CDRs) of the mAb were  derived from B lymphocytes of a naturally 
convalescent SARS -CoV-2-infected patient and, thus, have undergone natural positive 
and negative selection pressures in vivo, unlike humanized antibodies generated in 
Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO) Master Protocol  Version 1.0 , 27 Jul 2020  
  IND # [ADDRESS_705625] a microbial pathogen are 
mostly associated with either infusion -related immediate and non -immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions, or infusion -related cytokine release syndrome. Signs and 
symptoms of infusion -related immediate hypersensitivit y reactions may include, but are 
not limited to: anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, chills, diarrhea, hypotension, 
itching, skin rash, shortness of breath, urticarial, tachycardia, and throat irritation or 
chest  tightness. Additional signs and symptoms  associated with cytokine release 
syndrome may also include fever, headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting.  
 
The single infusion in this study will be administered at a controlled rate, the study 
participants will be monitored closely, and adjustments in t he infusion rate will be made 
and/or the infusion paused or stopped  as well as any supportive measures instituted as 
per local practice , if indicated.   
 
A theoretical risk is that LY3819253  may cause antibody -dependent enhancement 
(ADE) of viral replication  (section 3.2) .  This is based on responses observed to some 
monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541195] , Dengue  and Zika 
virus infections .  Unlike ADE associated with Dengue and Zika virus infections, this 
phenomenon has not been clearly established for coronavir us infections, such as 
severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] ( SARS ) and Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686]  
(MERS ), and has not been reported to date with SARS -CoV-2.  Additionally, limited 
experience with the use of convalescent serum as a treatment for patients with severe 
COVID -19 has not indicated safety concerns  (3). LY3819253  will be administered to 
patients at sufficientl y high dose levels to neutralize SARS -CoV-2 and avoid sub -
neutralizing concentrations in the presence of virus that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_541196].  Both in vitro  and in vivo  (non-human primate) experiments have been 
completed, and no evidence of ADE of infection was observed at sub -neutralizing 
concentrations of LY3819253 . 
 
The p otential benefit  of LY3819253 is, that the clinical  course of COVID -19 may be 
improved , which may inclu de a faster recovery from COVID -19.   
 
In Study PYAA , 24 adult participants were randomized and received  either  LY3819253 
or placebo  through 03 July  2020 .  A total of 18 participants received  LY3819253 (6 
participants each receiving either  700 mg , 2800 mg  or 7000 mg ) and 6 received 
placebo .  
 
Based on preliminary data from the data cutoff date of 03 July 2020  in Study PYAA , 
LY3819253 has been well tolerated by [CONTACT_541202], serious adverse 
events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) have been reported . 
No AEs of infusion -related reaction (IRR) considered to be related to LY3819253 by [CONTACT_1268] (PI) have been reported  in this study. Overall, the frequency of 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in Study PYAA was 23 in 10 participants 
dosed wit h LY3819253 (across all doses) or placebo. There were a similar number of 
Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO) Master Protocol  Version 1.0 , 27 Jul 2020  
  IND # [ADDRESS_705626] been no dose -limiting safety issues identified.  Of the data received to date , 
PK/PD were wi thin expected limits.  
 
In Study PYAB , 26 adult participants entered and were randomized to receive either  
placebo or  LY3819253  at doses of 700 mg  or 2800 mg  (the 7000mg cohort was 
initiated  on 03 July 2020) .  Based on the data cutoff date of [ADDRESS_705627] been reported.  The study remains blinded.   
 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and 
reasonably expected adverse events of LY3819253  may be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure, Participant Information Leaflet, and/or Development Safety Update Report.  
 
Given the data on LY3819253 from the on -going Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies,  the 
well-described safety profile of other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies , and the limited 
disease directed therapeutic options for patients with COVID -19 illness, the overall 
benefit -risk assessment of this study is considered favorable.  
 
H1.1.2 Motivation for agent selection  by [CONTACT_541203] T rial Oversight Committee (TOC)  
The Lilly antibody LY3819253 discovered in partnership with AbCel lera was identified 
from over 400 antibody sequences isolated from blood  of a convalescent SARS -CoV-2 
infected patient and is a  very high affinity binder of the receptor binding domain (RBD)  
of the viral S-protein .  In live virus neutralization in vitro  assays, LY3819253 has very 
high potency  against SARS-CoV-2. Based on current information  available to the TOC ,  
LY3819253 appears to have an excellent potency profile among the RBD antibodies 
available. Further , the Lilly data demonstrate binding to both the ACE -2-interacting and 
the resting state of the RBD, neutralization across multiple strains of live virus, and 
binding across RBD known mutations of SARS -CoV-2, which provides enc ouraging 
evidence of a low risk of viral reactivation.  
LY3819253 has an open IND, and a single -ascending -dose study in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_541197]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The Lilly strategy, assuming safety and 
tolerability, is , to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_541198]. Clinical trial materials are sufficient to support the general investigative plan, 
and Lilly will begin drug substance commercial manufacturing at risk at their 
Branchburg, NJ site with plans for drug product manufacturing at their parenteral fill 
facility in Indianapolis, IN.  
Lilly’s statement regarding plans for licensure : Lilly  is a global pharmaceutical company 
and attempts to bring important medical breakthroughs to as m any patients in as many 
countries as possible. It would therefore be our general intent to pursue licensure in 
countries where the trial occurs. In the case of the COVID -19 pandemic, the actual 
decision to pursue licensure will be impacted by [CONTACT_541204]: status 
of the COVID pandemic in the country and medical need, availability of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541199], available drug supply and other supply feasibility issues, and other 
regulatory considerations .

 H1.1.3 Justification for dose chosen  for LY3819253  
The dose levels of LY3819253  administered in this study are informed by [CONTACT_26769] J2W-
MC-PYAA  (PYAA)  and J2W -MC-PYAB ( BLAZE -1). In both studies, 700, 2800, and 
[ADDRESS_705628] an efficacy signal for an efficacious therapy. There are no significant  safety 
concern s about using the 7000 mg  dose, as side effects in antibody therapy are not 
generally dose -dependent.  
 
H1.2. Agent specific eligibility criteria  
     In addition to those outlined in the master protocol.  
H1.2.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1) Non-pregnant female p articipants who are of reproductive potential  and male 
participants who are able  to father a child must abstain from male/fema le sexual 
intercourse or agree to use two forms of effective contraception, where at least one 
form is highly effective (less than 1% failure rate), for the entirety of the st udy and 
for 90 days after investigational agent is administered .  
 
Highly effective methods of contraception (less than 1% failure rate) include, but are 
not limited to:  
• combination oral contraceptives  
• implanted contraceptives  
• intrauterine devices  
Effective methods of contraception include, but are not limited to :  
• diaphragms and cervical caps with spermicide  
• cervical sponges  
• condoms with spermicide  
 
NOTE:  
• Use of male and female condoms as a double barrier method is not 
considered acceptable due to the high failure rate when these barrier 
methods are combined.  
• Barrier protection methods without concomitant use of a spermicide are not 
an effective or acceptable method of contraception.  
• Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,  symptothermal, post -
ovulation methods), and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.   
 
Participants not of reproductive potential are eligible without requiring the use of a 
contraceptive method. Participant -reported history is acceptable documentation of 
surgical sterilization and menopause.  
Therapeutics for Inpatients with COVID-19 (TICO) Master Protocol  Version 1.0 , 27 Jul 2020  
  IND # 151543  
 
Appendix H1 -5 
 Participants with pregnant partners should use condoms during vaginal intercourse 
through 90 days after investigational agent administration.  
 
Participants should refrain from sperm donation  through 90 days after 
investigational agent administration.  
  
NOTE: Reproductive potential is defined as patients who have reached menarche, 
who have not been post -menopausal for at least 12 consecutive months with 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥ 40 IU/ml or [ADDRESS_705629] other 
clinical condition that could induce amenorrhea, who are not taking medications 
such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotro pin releasing hormone, anti -
estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or chemotherapy that 
could induce amenorrhea. Individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate 
medical cause (e.g. Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator 
discretion should be applied.  
 
H1.3. Description of investigational agent  
H1.3.1. Administration and duration  
See the PIM and Pharmacy Procedures  for details. See also section H1.[ADDRESS_705630] 2 hours after completion of the infusion. Additional monitoring  may be 
necessary based on clinical judgement of the study investigator(s) and/or site staff , and 
in accordance with the master protocol . The site must have  resuscitation equipment, 
emergency drugs and appropriately  trained  staff available during the infusion and for at 
least 2 hours after the completion of the infusion.  
 
If a participant has not already received the relevant dose of remdesivir at the day of 
enrolment, and has no contraindications to start remdesivir, it is recommended (but not 
required) that the relevant dose of remdesivir is infused after the infusion of LY3819253 
/placebo is completed.  
 
H1.3.2. Formulation and preparation  
LY3819253 is provided in vials of [ADDRESS_705631] be stored between 2ºC and 8ºC. 
A total of 10 vials is required for dosing of the agent at 7000 mg (see table H1.1). 
Placebo is normal  saline. The study medication is prepared by a unblinded pharmacist 
at the local pharmacy . To ensure blinding o f the participant and clinical staff a colored 
sleeve will be placed over the infusion bags used  (see PIM and Pharmacy 
Procedures ).

information  and the relevant protocol  appendix/appendices, as well as the most recent 
package insert, In vestigator’s  Brochure, or updated information from D CR, NIAID to 
obtain the most current information on drug interactions, contraindications, and 
precautions.  
 
H1.3.5. Precautionary medications  
The clinical site should have necessary equipment and medications for the  
management of any infusion reaction  (see section H1.5 below).   
 
Premedication for infusions is not planned. However, if an infusion reaction occurs 
during administration or if the participant has a medical history suggesting a potential  
benefit from premedication, the study investigator(s) should determine the appropriate 
premedication.  
 
The investigators and sponsor may decide to recommend premedication , if the 
frequency of infusion reactions among participants warrants it.  If minor infusion 
reactions are observed, administration of acetaminophen, 500 mg to 1000 mg, 
antihistamines and/or other appropriately indicated medications may be given prior to

 the start of infusions for subsequent participants. The decision to implemen t 
premedication for infusions in subsequent participants will be made by [CONTACT_541205]. Any premedications given will 
be documented as a concomitant therapy.  
H1.4. Clinical and laboratory evaluations  
 
H1.4.1 Timing of Assessments  
Appendix B outlines the clinical and laboratory monitoring. Assessment and reporting 
of AEs (section 10.1.1 ), SAEs (section 10.1.2 ) and unanticipated problems (section 
10.1.3 ) and their severity, causality (section 10.1.5) and expectedness (section 10.1.6) 
is performed as outlined in the relevant section of the master protocol .  
 
H1.4.2 Immunogenicity Assessments  
At the visits specified in the master protocol  (Days 0, 28, and 90) venous blood 
samples will be collected to determine antibody production against LY3819253 . 
Immunogenicity may be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect ADAs in the 
presence of LY3819253 at a laboratory approved by [CONTACT_11007]. Ant ibodies may be further 
characterized for their ability to neutralize the activity of LY3819253 . Remaining volume 
from the PK sample  may also be used for immunogenicity assessments as needed.    
 
H1.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
At the visits specified in the master protocol (Days 0, 1, 5, 28, and 90)  venous blood 
samples will be collected to determine LY3819253 serum concentration for 
pharmacokinetic assessment. The PK/Immunogenicity assessment will require 2mL of 
the serum collected , as described in the Master Protocol Appendix B as “Research 
Sample Storage”.   PK samples may be assessed by a validated assay at a 
bioanalytical lab designated by [CONTACT_11007]. The PK assessment will use the same 2ml serum 
aliquot  specified in the Immu nogenicity assessment section above (4.2). Analysis of 
samples from placebo -treated subjects is not planned. Remaining sample used for PK  
may be pooled and used for exploratory metabolism or bioanalytical method 
experiments as deemed appropriate .  
H1.5. Clinical management issues  
All participants should be monitored closely  for 2 hours  after the infusion , as there is a 
risk of infusion reaction and hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) with any biological 
agent.  
H1.5.1. Symptoms and Signs  
Symptoms and signs that may occur as part of an infusion reaction , include, but are not 
limited to , fever, chills, nausea, headache, bronchospasm, hypotension, a ngioedema, 
throat irritation, rash including urticaria, pruritus, myalgia, and dizziness.  
Infusion -related reactions ’ severity will be assessed and reported using the Division of 
AIDS  (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Corrected version 2.1 (July 2017)  (Table H1.2 ).

H1.5.2. Site Needs  
The clinical site should have necessary equipment , medications , adequately qualified 
and experienced staff with appropriate medical cover  for the management of any 
infusion reaction, which may include , but is not limited to , oxygen, IV fluid, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  
(/adrenaline) , acetaminophen  (/paracetamol)  and antihistamine.  
The pharmacy must use  amber -colored Ultraviolet Light -Inhibiting (UVLI) pro tective 
bags to place over the infusion bag. The pharmacy will be provided with labels to be 
placed on the IV bag before dispensing ( refer to the Pharmacy Procedures ). 
The pharmacy is required to provide normal saline and IV bags , similarly shrouded .  
H1.5.3. Management of Infusion Reactions  including  Discontinuation  
Investigators will use their clinical judgement and standard of care to evaluate and 
manage all infusion reactions. If an infusion reaction occurs, then supportive care 
should be used in accordance with the signs and symptoms. If a severe and potentially 
life-threatening infusion reaction occurs with LY3819253 /placebo, its use should be 
permanently discontinued.

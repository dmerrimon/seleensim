outcomes after orthopedic surgery. This phenomenon is especially prevalent in 
older adults. Our ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_910760] (Wysa) can improve orthopedic patients’ mental 
health symptoms, but we also encountered implementation barriers related to 
discussing mental health in an orthopedic setting. The long-term goal of this line of 
research is to enable the provision of true comprehensive care to improve both the 
physical and mental health of orthopedic patients. The goals of this project are to 
address the implementation barriers we encountered in our ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_910761] a definitive trial to assess the effectiveness of a digital mental health 
intervention in the context of orthopedic care.  
The specific aims are to:  
1.) identify the contextual determinants of implementation success for addressing 
patients’ mental health in the context of orthopedic care ;  
2.) conduct usability testing for two mental health interventions which can feasibly 
be implemented in a real-world orthopedic setting: a digital mental health 
intervention (Wysa) and a novel printed resource guide; and  
3.) identify the intermediate mechanisms through which a digital mental health 
intervention (Wysa) improves mental health symptoms in orthopedic patients. 
Using standard qualitative methods and guided by [CONTACT_910775] (CFIR) and the COM-B model of behavior change, 
two stakeholder groups will be interviewed: orthopedic providers and older adult 
orthopedic spi[INVESTIGATOR_446125].  
In addition to addressing specific needs and preferences related to discussing 
mental health in the setting of orthopedic care, patient stakeholders will complete 
usability testing of Wysa and of the novel printed guide of local and online mental 
health resources.  
Next, the patient stakeholders will receive one month of access to Wysa. They will 
complete measures of clinical effectiveness (self-reported depression, anxiety, 
pain interference, physical function) and hypothesized behavioral targets 
(behavioral activation, pain acceptance, sleep quality) at baseline and one-month

 [ADDRESS_1279564] are:  
 
1.) identification of stakeholder-informed implementation strategies for mental health 
interventions tailored for the orthopedic setting,  
 
2.) refined digital and printed mental health interventions that are scalable and 
acceptable to older patients, and  
 
3.) requisite planning data to facilitate successful completion of a subsequent clinical 
trial.  
 
A3 Purpose of the Study Protocol 
 
The goals of this project are to:  
 
1.) identify effective implementation strategies to introduce mental health intervention in 
the context of real-world orthopedic care,  
 
2.) optimize the usability of two mental health interventions (Wysa and a novel printed 
resource guide) for older adult orthopedic patients, and  
 
3.) identify the intermediate mechanisms through which Wysa has an effect.  
 
B Background 
B1 Prior Literature and Studies 
Depression and anxiety heighten musculoskeletal pain and negatively impact outcomes 
after orthopedic surgery.1-5 Targeted mental health treatment can improve both physical 
and mental health in these patients,6-8 but a gap remains in effectively and routinely 
engaging orthopedic patients in mental health care in an acceptable, sustainable, and 
scalable fashion. Barriers include: 1.) limited orthopedic provider time and knowledge to 
discuss mental health resources,9 2.) patient concerns regarding cost, transportation, 
and time necessary for mental health treatment,10-13 and 3.) a national shortage of mental 
health professionals.[ADDRESS_1279565] minority groups of all 
types.15 
 
Our ongoing, funded pi[INVESTIGATOR_910762] (Wysa) based on behavioral activation, mindfulness, and sleep health 
meaningfully improves PROMIS Depression and Anxiety scores in orthopedic patients 
across the adult age spectrum at one- and two-month follow-up. However, the clinical 
context (e.g., team member leading the discussion, words used to discuss mental

B2 Rationale for this Study 
Depression and anxiety worsen musculoskeletal pain and reduce the effectiveness of 
traditional orthopedic treatments. Nevertheless, addressing mental health is not currently 
a part of standard treatment for orthopedic conditions. The purpose of this study is to 
identify strategies to address mental health in the context of orthopedic care in a manner 
that is feasible, effective, and acceptable to patients and clinicians. 
C Study Objectives 
C1 Primary Aim 
Aim 1: Identify the contextual determinants of implementation success for 
addressing patients’ mental health in the context of orthopedic care. 
Using standard qualitative methods, two stakeholder groups will be interviewed: WU 
orthopedic providers and orthopedic spi[INVESTIGATOR_446125] ≥ [ADDRESS_1279569] half of patient 
stakeholders will be women, and one quarter will identify as an under-represented 
minority. In semi-structured interviews guided by [CONTACT_61742] (CFIR) and the COM-B model of behavior change, providers 
and patients will describe needs and preferences related to addressing mental health in 
a clinical and research context (e.g., recruiting and retaining orthopedic patients in a 
mental health related randomized controlled trial).  
 
Aim 2: Conduct usability testing for two mental health interventions which can 
feasibly be implemented in a real-world orthopedic setting: a digital mental health 
intervention (Wysa) and a novel printed resource guide. 
Using semi-structured interviews and the System Usability Scale (SUS), orthopedic 
patients will participate in an iterative user design process to refine the delivery of Wysa 
and a printed guide of local and online mental health resources. The printed guide is 
being prepared as an “enhanced usual care” control intervention for a subsequent R01 
randomized controlled trial proposal.17 ,18 
 
Aim 3: Identify the intermediate mechanisms through which a digital mental health 
intervention (Wysa) improves mental health symptoms in orthopedic patients. 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_910765], patients will receive one month of access to 
Wysa. Measures of clinical effectiveness (self-reported PROMIS Depression, Anxiety, 
Pain Interference, and Physical Function19) and hypothesized behavioral targets 
(Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-SF, Chronic Pain Acceptance 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 9 Questionnaire-8, and Athens Insomnia Scale) will be collected at baseline and one-
month follow-up.20-[ADDRESS_1279570] two specific mental health 
interventions: a customized version of a commercial digital mental health intervention 
(Wysa) and a prototype of a print-based mental health resource guide. The patient 
stakeholders will be provided one month of Wysa access, and they will complete 
baseline and follow-up measures related to usability, clinical effectiveness, and 
intermediate behavioral mechanisms through which Wysa is hypothesized to act.  
Wysa usage data will be obtained from the app company. Delivery of Wysa and the 
printed resource guide will be iteratively refined based on user feedback. [ADDRESS_1279571] for 
neck and/or back pain (spi[INVESTIGATOR_910766], physiatrist, or APP within either of 
those two divisions) for new or return evaluation 
o 18+ years old 
o Musculoskeletal pain for 3+ months 
 
Exclusion Criteria  
o Routine post-op visit, with no plans for further surgery at this time 
o Endorses mental health crisis (active suicidal or homicidal ideation, 
psychosis) 
o Cognitive impairment which would interfere with meaningful engagement 
with research interview, questionnaires, and/or intervention 
2.a Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process 
Providers: 
- Eligible providers are already known, through departmental contacts 
- E-mail will be sent to eligible providers in batches until enough interviews have 
been scheduled and performed to reach data saturation 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 10- *Verbal consent (waiver of written consent) requested for providers, since they 
will just be participating in semi-structured interviews. 
Patients: 
- Prospectively and/or retrospectively review clinic schedules for surgical and non-
operative orthopedic spi[INVESTIGATOR_910767] 
- To reach purposive sampling goals, some potentially eligible patients may be 
called prior to appointment date to notify them of the study, assess preliminary 
interest, and ask to plan staying 60-[ADDRESS_1279572] with parking expenses (eg parking 
validation ticket at CAM). 
- Patients will officially be screened at the time of and/or after their orthopedic 
clinic visit to verify eligibility. 
- *Written consent for patients when consent is obtained in clinic. Request the 
option for verbal consent if the participant is consented over the phone/Zoom. 
 
Contact [CONTACT_43056] / permission:  
Providers: 
- Participants will be e-mailed to be invited to participate. 
- They will be asked to complete a brief “demographics” descriptive questionnaire. 
Patients: 
- Participants will be called or approached in person to be invited to participate. 
- During the consent process, they will be asked whether they agree for e-mail 
and/or text messages to be sent to them. Based on their response, a link to the 
follow-up REDCap survey will be sent via e-mail and/or text message. 
Participants will also be called, e-mailed, and/or text messaged as necessary for 
reminders to complete the survey. 
 
2.b Randomization Method  
No randomization method.  No control group. 
2.c Risks and Benefits 
Risks: 
You may experience one or more of the risks indicated below from being in this study. In 
addition to these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, 
associated with being in this study.  
 
Although very unlikely, subjects participating in this study may feel inconvenienced from 
completion of multiple surveys and/or uncomfortable answering some of the survey 
questions. This risk is minimal because participants will be informed of the estimated 
time commitment and general content of the survey questions before they consent to 
participate. The seriousness of this risk is low because participants can withdraw from 
the study at any time.  
 
One risk of participating in this study is that confidential information about you may be 
accidentally disclosed.  We will use our best efforts to keep the information about you 
secure. Please see the section in this consent form titled “How will you keep my 
information confidential?” for more information. 
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 11Benefits: 
You will not benefit from being in this study. 
 
However, we hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study because 
information obtained from this study may lead to a better understanding of how to treat 
patients in an orthopaedic clinic who also experience depression and/or anxiety. 
2.d Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
If a participant would like to withdraw from this study, they can contact [CONTACT_910776].   
2.e Treatment Regimen  
After agreeing to participate, patient participants will continue their participation in their 
orthopedic care plan, as directed by [CONTACT_263235].  We will also assist the 
participant in downloading the Wysa app to their smartphone or other electronic device, 
if desired. Through the Wysa app, participants can track and manage their emotions, 
and they can learn research-based techniques to help them feel better and manage any 
stress or pain they may be dealing with. Participants will have access to research-based 
wellness tools such as supportive listening, deep breathing techniques, guided 
meditation, yoga, and more. Participants can communicate with a virtual artificial 
intelligence (AI) chatbot, and/or they can message a highly trained and qualified human 
well-being coach. The intended use of the Wysa app is to encourage mental well-being 
as an early intervention tool in a self-help context. The Wysa app is considered 
investigational, which means that it has not been approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration.  
 
Participants will have access to the Wysa app services for one month, and they can use 
any or all of the services as much or as little as they find useful. No one on the 
Washington University study team will read participants’ chats to the Wysa chatbot. Any 
chats with a human Wysa well-being coach will remain between just the participant and 
their coach. The study team will only receive information on whether the participant used 
the Wysa app, how much they used each feature and/or found it helpful. Participants will 
be e-mailed and/or sent a text message to the follow-up survey link after one month. The 
surveys will ask them about their current level of wellness and whether they found the 
app helpful. 
 
   
2.f Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
No control group.  Everyone in the provider group, gets the same treatment, and 
everyone in the patient group will get the same treatment. 
E Study Procedures  
E1 Screening for Eligibility 
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 12Recruitment of orthopedic provider stakeholders: 
Three of the study investigators are faculty members within the WU Department of 
Orthopaedic Surgery. As such, they have professional and personal relationships with 
the vast majority of the 70+ orthopedic clinicians and their support staff at WU. These 
relationships will facilitate a high rate of rapid recruitment from this group of stakeholders 
into the study. In addition to universal secure, virtual meeting capabilities among this 
group (Zoom-HIPAA), all orthopedic faculty members have dedicated, secure academic 
office space in which private semi-structured interviews can be conducted in person. 
 
Recruitment of orthopedic patient stakeholders: 
The study PI ([CONTACT_253998]) is one of over [ADDRESS_1279573] County Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and the 
Barnes-Jewish Center for Advanced Medicine – South County. Furthermore, all of the 
WU Orthopedics spi[INVESTIGATOR_910768] (PROMIS CAT Depression and Anxiety), and [CONTACT_910779]’s research coordinator has specifically enrolled older adult orthopedic patients 
with spi[INVESTIGATOR_910769]. This patient base and the mental health screening 
measures will facilitate seamless recruitment of patient stakeholders with a range of self-
reported depression and anxiety symptom severity. Additionally, [CONTACT_253998] and several 
other spi[INVESTIGATOR_910770], and her team has experience recruiting, consenting, and 
enrolling patients into research studies in person and virtually (via phone or Zoom-
HIPAA), from her own clinics and from those of her clinical colleagues. The in-person 
and virtual participation options will allow patients to participate in the semi-structured 
interview and usability testing in whichever format is preferred. When convenient for the 
participant, study recruitment, consent, and the interview can be completed within 
approximately one hour of the patient’s clinical encounter.

E4 Follow up.  
A link to the follow-up REDCap survey will be emailed and/or text messaged to patient 
participants at one month. These surveys, listed in the chart above, will be the system 
usability scale (Wysa), BADS-SF, CPAQ-8, Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), PROMIS 
measures, and a follow up survey.  This will be for the patient participats only, and the 
only follow up that will occur. 
E5 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
5.a Safety and Compliance Monitoring 
The research coordinator will document any adverse events reported and review these 
adverse events with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_650825].   
 
If excessive adverse events are reported, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_910771] 
a participant should be removed from the study to ensure the study participants are not 
being injured. 
5.b Definitions of Adverse Events 
Any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject including any abnormal sign, 
symptom, or disease. 
5.c Classification of Events 
i Relationship 
The adverse event will be considered related to the study if it was determined to be due 
to using the Wysa app. 
ii Severity 
Any adverse experience occurring at any time that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
o Death 
o A life-threatening experience 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
o A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 15o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other experience which, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
iii Expectedness 
Any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent expected risks in 
this study. 
 
Risks: 
Participants may experience one or more of the risks indicated below from being in this 
study. In addition to these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not 
anticipate, associated with being in this study.  
 
Although very unlikely, subjects participating in this study may feel inconvenienced from 
completion of multiple surveys and/or uncomfortable answering some of the survey 
questions. This risk is minimal because participants will be informed of the estimated 
time commitment and general content of the survey questions before they consent to 
participate. The seriousness of this risk is low because participants can withdraw from 
the study at any time.  
 
One risk of participating in this study is that confidential information about you may be 
accidentally disclosed.  We will use our best efforts to keep the information about you 
secure. Please see the section in this consent form titled “How will you keep my 
information confidential?”  for more information. 
 
Unanticipated problem involving risks to participants or others 
 
o Are unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the study-related documents, such as the IRB-
approved research study and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 
o Are related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 
o Suggest that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized. 
5.d Data Collection Procedures for Adverse Events 
The research coordinator will document any adverse events reported in a spreadsheet 
that is password protected and only available to be viewed by [CONTACT_3476]. 
 
All adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_650825]. 
5.e Reporting Procedures 
Events will be reported per the Washington University Institutional Review Board 
Procedures.   
 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 165.f Adverse Event Reporting Period 
Events that qualify for immediate reporting described above will be reported within the 
following timeframe: 
a. 10 working days of the occurrence of the event or notification to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_910772].  
b. The death of a research participant should be reported within 1 working day of 
the occurrence of the event or notification to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_910773].  
 
Adverse events/other events that do not require immediate reporting will be provided to 
the IRB in summary format at the time of continuing review. 
F Statistical Plan  
F1  Sample Size Determination and Power 
No power calculation was performed for this study because the primary aim involves 
a qualitative analysis. The sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_910777].  
F2  Interim Monitoring and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_910774].  Patients 
in the study will be monitored on an as needed basis to assure that they are doing well.  
 
Adverse events will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cheng to determine if they are serious, 
unexpected and related to the study procedures.    
 
If a complication should arise, the patient would be previously instructed how to contact 
[CONTACT_23164].  
F3  Statistical Methods  
Interviews will be audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Using inductive and 
deductive coding approaches based on CFIR and COM-B, a codebook will be developed 
by [CONTACT_459636], and one or more team members will code all transcripts using 
NVivo. Group discussion among the research team will be used to resolve coding 
discrepancies, confirm data saturation has been reached, and organize codes into 
themes. Scores on the System Usability Scale will be used to iteratively refine both 
mental health interventions under investigation. Longitudinal PROMIS score changes will 
be compared between “high” and “low” Wysa users (defined by [CONTACT_910778]), 
and associations between changes in behavioral targets (behavioral activation, pain 
acceptance, sleep quality) and clinical outcomes (depression, anxiety) will be assessed.

 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Parkinson’s  disease  (PD)  is a progressive  neurodegenerative  condition  affecting  large numbers of people 
[ADDRESS_335540] epi[INVESTIGATOR_274631],20 as well as in several 
smaller studies of that type.21-23 
 
There is reason to believe then that one or more feature s of diabetes accelera te pathogenesis of PD. 
One feature likely to do this is systemic insulin resistance, a prominent characteristic of type 2 diabetes 
(T2D). As noted above, PD cases commonly display impaired glucose tolerance, which is indicative of 
systemic insulin resistan ce.[ADDRESS_335541] reliable means of 
reducing brain insulin resistance appears to be treatmen t with receptor agonists of glucagon -like 
peptide 1 (GLP -1).43 This is a naturally occurring peptide for which receptors are found throughout 
much of the brain,44 including the human cerebral cortex.45 Two currently marketed GLP -1 receptor 
agonists with go od safety profiles, exenatide and liraglutide, are well known for their neuroprotective 
effects on animal models of PD.46-50 
 
Twice daily administration of exenatide  has been tested  in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_274632] s.51,52 This singl e-blind  trial on 45 patients showed  that those taking the drug for 12 months 
improved to a significant degree  on the Movement Disorders Society’s  Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating scale (MDS -UPDRS, +2.7 points)  compared  to a decline  (-2.2 points)  in control  patients not 
administered the drug.  It also showed a highly significant improvement in the Mattis dementia rating 
scale (MDRS, +2.8 points) in patients on exenatide compared to a decline ( -3.5 points) in control 
patients. A follo w-up study  a year after the trial ended (i.e., a year off exenatide ) found preservation of 
both the motor and cognitive benefits of the trial.[ADDRESS_335542] , providing evidence that the pathogenesis of  PD can be slowed or stopped. 
These findings  are being pursued in a placebo -controlled, once weekly exenatide (By[CONTACT_28556]) trial on PD 
cases in London  (https://foxtrialfinder.michael jfox.org/trial/3583 /; http://www.ucl.ac.uk/exenatid e-pd). 
 
 
U1111 -[ADDRESS_335543] because it has recently been found more effective than 
once weekly exenatide in reducing body weight.53 Liraglutide , which is currently indicated for once -daily 
administrat ion in adults with T2D up to 1.8 mg/day and for weight management at 3.0 mg/day,  is also 
more effective than exenatide (twice daily or weekly) in reducing hyperglycemia,53-[ADDRESS_335544] evidence from 
ex vivo insulin stimulation studies that liraglutide applied directly to brain tissue can reduce insulin 
resistance there in mild  cognitive impairment (MCI) cases in a mouse model of AD.43 Finally , liraglutide 
exerts neuroprotective effects in the mouse MPTP model of PD at 25 nmoles/kg body weight, but 
exenatide does not.[ADDRESS_335545] indirectly by [CONTACT_274651], thereby [CONTACT_274652], 
which induces brain insulin resistance noted earlier.  
 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous particles and are secreted from nearly every cell type 
throughout the body, whereas the term exosomes refers to a subtype of EVs from [ADDRESS_335546] been implicated in a variety of functions. A recently developed methodology allows isolating plasma 
EVs enriched for neuronal origin85. To date, this approach has been mostly implemented to pursue 
biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease including t he main pathogenic proteins ( p-tau and Aβ42 ) but also 
intracellular signaling molecules, such as phosphorylated IRS -1, Cathepsin -D, REST, LRP6, and others 
.81-[ADDRESS_335547] for the study of brain insulin resistance  are the findings concerning IRS -1. In 
plasma EVs enriched for neuronal origin, total pSer312 - and p -PanY - (pan-Tyr phosphorylated) IRS -1 
was measured in a clinical cohort of AD patients and cognitively normal (CN) older control subjects (as 
well as patients with Frontotemporal Dementia, as a neurodegenerative disease control, and cognit ively 
normal patients with diabetes, as a metabolic disease control). Two phospho -species, as well as their ratio, 
were  shown to be  highly significantly different in AD patients vs. all control groups. Interestingly, subjects 
with diabetes had intermediate  values between AD patients and CN controls, suggesting that the peripheral 
IR that characterizes diabetes is linked to some degree to brain IR and corroborating the extensive body of 
literature suggesting that IR and diabetes are risk factors for AD, but by [CONTACT_274653]. Furthermore, IRS -[ADDRESS_335548] its phosphorylation status in 
specific brain regions that suffer brain atrophy in early AD in association with higher burden of brain 
insulin resistance . These finding s provide hope that using these biomarkers  may also possibly  demonstrate 
target engagement and follow response to tr eatment in clinical trials  that aim to reverse brain insulin 
resistance (e.g. liraglu tide).

 In summary, there is mounting evidence that PD pathogenesis is accelerated by [CONTACT_274654] , thereby [CONTACT_274655] -motor 
symptoms of the disorder.  
 
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:  
 
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to test the therapeutic efficacy and safety of liraglutide  
treatment of patients with idiopathic PD.  The secondary objective is to correlate the magnitude of any 
observed therapeutic efficacy with degree of reduction in  peripheral insulin resistance over the course  of 
drug treatment.  
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  
 
Study Hypothes es: We hypothesize that global disease status (MD S-UPDRS) and especially cognition 
in PD patients will improve significantly by [CONTACT_274656] (i.e., drug vehicle).  We also hypothesize that the improvement 
seen in each pa tient will be proportional to the degree of improvement  in peripheral as well as neuronal 
insulin resistance seen in the treatment period.   
 
Endpoints:  The primary outcomes are measures of the drug’s effects on motor  (assessed by [CONTACT_274657] -
UPDRS III)  and non -motor  symptoms of PD  (assessed by [CONTACT_274658] -2) after 52 weeks of 
treatment  at full tolerated dose . The secondary outcomes are measures of the association between  
liraglutide’s effects on peripheral insulin resistance , markers of insulin resist ance on plasma EVs 
enriched for neuronal origin, PD symptoms  and safety .  
 
Study Type: This is a phase II, randomized, double -blinded, placebo -controlled  clinical trial . 
 
STUDY POPULATION:

 every effort will be made by [CONTACT_079]  (PI) to keep accepted  subject s in the study. 
However, should the subject decide to discontinue treatment, all efforts will be made to complete and 
report the observations as thoroughly as possible, including a complete final evaluation at the time of the 
subject's withdrawal with an ex planation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study. All subjects 
who prematurely withdraw  from the study will receive a follow -up telephone call one month after 
discontinuation.  Study treatment will be stopped if any of the following events occur:  
 
• The subject has any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other medical 
condition that indicates to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_274634] a or other medications essential to the treatment of 
Parkinson’s disease. Subjects experiencing AEs that are  present at the end of their participation in 
the study should receive follow -up, as appropriate. If possible, the outcome of any AE resulting in 
withdrawal from the study  or that was present at the end of the study will be followed until 
resolution or return to baseline condition, particularly if the AE was considered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_274635];  
• The subject requires a concomitant medication that is prohibited in the study;  
• The subject wishes to withdraw consent from the study in the absence of a medical need  to 
withdraw , as determined by [CONTACT_737];  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_274636];  
• The s ubject is noncompliant;  or 
• If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study  medication must 
immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known . If pregnancy is confirmed, 
the study medication will be permanently discontinued and the  subject withdrawn from the study.  
Reasonable attempts will be made to follow the pregnancy to conclusion in order  to obtain 
information regarding the outcome.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_274637] ( e.g., safety laboratory  
parameters, ECG, physical examination, vital signs [including orthostatic BP and HR]) and  study 
documentation for subjects who withdraw from the study  treatment a nd specify  the reason for  their 
withdrawal . Once subjects withdraw  from the study, they will revert to the care of their usual physician 
for treatment/management of their disease as appropriate.  
 
Subject Replacement:  A subject who withdraws from the study may not reenter the study.  
 
Rationale for Study Population : (see Background and Significance)  
 
Visit Procedures : (see Study Schedule)  
 
Assessment s for Efficacy : The efficacy of liraglutide will be assessed by [CONTACT_274659]’s effects 
versus placebo on PD motor and non -motor symptoms quantified  on the following scales after study  
medication  titration  in active  and placebo  groups : 
 
• MDS -UPDRS  part I, II, III and IV changes  from  ON medication  baseline  at 28 and 54 weeks   
• MDS -UPDRS  part III changes  from  OFF medication  baseline  at 28 and 54 weeks   
• Non-Motor  Symptoms  Scale  (NMSS)  changes  from  ON medication  baseline  at 28 and 5 4 
weeks  
 
U1111 -1173 -0106                July 29, 2020 Page 9 
 • PDQ -39 Quality  of Life scale  changes  from  baseline  at 28 and 54 weeks  
• MDRS -[ADDRESS_335550]  assesses  overall  
cognitive functioning  on 5 subscales  measuring specific  abilities  including  attention,  
initiation/perseveration,  construction,  conceptualization,  and memory.  
• To complement  the MDR S-2, additional  neuropsychological  assessment  tools  will include:  
o Delis-Kaplan  Executive  Function  System  (DKEFS)  Verbal  Fluency,  a standardized  
assessment  tool with robust  psychometric  properties.  Verbal fluency  has been  established  
as a highly  sensitive  cognitive  construct  to neuropathology  in individuals  with PD (e.g., 
sensitive  to striatal  pathology  or dorsolateral  frontal  dysfunction).  
o Geriatric  Depression  Scale  
o The Parkinson's  Anxiety  Scale . 
Inclusion  of these  brief  mood  measures  will assist  in assessing drug effects on the subjects’ health -
related  quality  of life. 
 
Assessment s for Safety : Safety  and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_274660],  weight,  
clinical labora tory measures , and adverse  events . Routine  laboratory  studies  performed  at the beginning  
and the end of  the study  will include  CBC,  renal  function,  liver function,  serum amylase,  serum lipase, 
serum calcitonin77, and fasting serum glucose  and insulin . In addition , an ECG will be performed at 
baseline  and follo w-up visits.  The number  of patients  completing  the study  will be calculated  and will 
establish  the tolerability  of the study  compound  at the studied  doses.  It is expect ed that over 80% (43 
subjects)  will safely  complete  the study.  
 
Other Assessments: Measures of peripheral  insulin sensitivity  will be used to test the association  of 
changes in such sensitivity to changes in  MDS -UPDRS and MDRS -2 scores from baseline to 28 and 54 
weeks.  Surrogate measures of peripheral insulin sensitivity will be used, specifically the homeostasis 
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) and  the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index 
(QUICKI).61,62 HOMA -IR is defined as f asting glucose (mmol/L) ×  fasting insulin (mU/L)/22.5 . 
QUICKI is defined as 1/[log fasting insulin (mU/L) + log fasting glucose (mg/dL)] . 
 
Note : While the validity of HOMA -IR as a surrogate measure of peripheral insulin sensitivity has been 
questioned given its failure to correlate with diet -induced insulin sensitivity in dogs63 and its erroneous 
prediction of differences in insulin sensitivity between non -diabetic African and European Americans ,64 
virtually all clinical studies report a significant correlation of HOMA -IR (or the similarly derived 
QUICKI index) with insulin sensitivity directly measured with the euglycemic -hyperins ulinemic clamp 
technique in normal, prediabetic, and diabetic cases of various ethnicities .65-74 Indeed, the only contrary 
studies are two reporting  that HOMA -IR and/or QUICKI are  not correlated with insulin sensitivity in 
normal Afro -Caribbean adults75 and a small population of  no rmal Caucasians .[ADDRESS_335551] Compliance : The PI [INVESTIGATOR_274638].  
 
U1111 -1173 -0106                July 29, 2020 Page 10 
  
Subjects who fail to comply with the drug schedule  for 70% of the days since the previous  study visit on 
one occasion will be considered for termination. If the  non-compliance was unrelated to an adverse 
event related to the study drug, then the Investigator  will need to evaluate whether the non -compliance is 
likely to recur. Subjects judged to be  high risks for continued non -compliance will terminated at the 
discretion of  the principal i nvestigator. Subjects who fail to c omply with the drug schedule  for 70% of 
the days preceding a study visit on a second occasion must be terminated  from the study. This 
mandatory termination due to non -compliance will be reported on the end  of study eCRF unless the non -
compliance was attrib utable to adverse effects of study drug.  
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
 
Sample Size Calculation : This is a randomized,  doubl e-blinded,  placeb o-controlled  clinical trial that 
aims  to evaluate the effects  of liraglutide  on motor  and non-motor  symptoms  in patients  diagnosed  
with PD. The primary  outcome  of this study  will be the difference  in MDR S-2 scores  at baseline  and 
follo w-up (52 weeks  after titration)  between  the active  and placebo  control  group. The power  
analysis  was performed  utilizing  data reported  in a previous  study  using  a similar GLP-[ADDRESS_335552]  
(Table 1). While score changes associated with active medication were not compared to a placebo 
group but to a cohort of patients treated with “conventional PD medication”, this data represent the 
closest approximation available for power analysis and sample size ca lculation.   
 
With a  total of 57 patients  (38 in the drug group and 1 9 in the placebo group ), the study will have an 
82.7% chance of rejecting  the null hypothesis  of equal  means,  assuming  an average  critical 
difference of 5.[ADDRESS_335553]  deviation of 6.4 for  the drug group and  5.3 for 
the placebo group  with a significance  level  (alpha)  of 0.[ADDRESS_335554].  
 
This sample  allows  for a 12% dropout  of up to 6 subjects (e.g., if  they are diagnosed  with T2D  
during  the course  of the study)  and still maintain  81.3%  power  with a total of 51 patients  (i.e., 36  
cases in the drug group and 15 cases in the plac ebo group ). If the rate of drop out is higher than 
anticipated, the study will enroll and randomize additional subjects; subjects will be 
enrolled/randomized in multiples of 3 subjects in order to maintain the 2:1 randomization . The 
additional enrolled subjects will a im to maintain the power of the study. In total,  up to  63 patients will 
be enrolled and randomized. No more than 42 patients, including drop outs, will be exposed to the drug 
during the trial.  
 
Statistical Methods : The analysis populations for this study are defined as:  
1. Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug  and have 
a baseline and at least one post -baseline efficacy  score  (MD RS-2 and MD S-UPDRS) .  
2. Per-Protocol (PP) population: a subset of the FAS population, excluding subjects with major 
deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the results of the primary efficacy analysis.  
3. Safety population: all randomiz ed subjects who receive at least one do se of study drug .  
The final determination of protocol violations, and therefore the composition of the PP population, will 
be made prior to unblinding the database and will be documented separately. Analysis of all efficacy

variables will be performed on the FAS and PP population. The FAS population will serve as the 
primary population for the analysis of efficacy data. Analyses based on the PP population will be 
considered as a sensitivity a nalysis. Subjects will be analyz ed for efficacy according to the treat ment to 
which they were randomiz ed.  
 
All safety outcomes will be analyz ed using the Safety pop ulation. Subjects will be analyz ed for safe ty 
according to the treatment  they actually received.  
 
Descriptive statistics:  The study population will be described using demographic, baseline , and subject 
characteristics. Descriptive statistics of demographic, baseline , and subject characteristics will be based 
on the Safety population. A detailed description of subje ct disposition will include:  
  
• A summary of data on subject discontinuations including reason for withdrawal  
• A summary of protocol violations and deviations  
 
All screened subjects will be accounted for in the dispos ition summaries. The number and percentage of 
subjects included in each anal ysis population will be summariz ed. 
 
Baseline and subject characteristics will include a summary of the following:  
 
• Subject demographics  
• Medical history including family history

 • Physical examination findings  
• Prior and concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
• HoMA -IR and QUICKI  index at baseline  
• MDRS -2 scores at  baseline   
• MDS -UPDRS  scores at  baseline

Inferential Statistics on  Primary Efficacy Parameter(s) : The primary analysis of eff icacy endpoint 
(changes in UPDRS, NMSS , and MD RS-2 score s between baseline and Week 54) will be assessed using 
a two-sided , two-sample  unequa l-variance  t-test to evaluate the differences in end points between the 
active and placebo cohorts. Multiple regression analysis will be used for comparisons of between -cohort 
differences in these outcomes over time. General linear models will be used to evaluate possible 
associations between baseline characteristics and the primary endpoints. Analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA)  will be used to evaluate possible effects of peripheral  insulin sensitivity and treatment 
group (independent variables) on the primary end points (depen dent variable).  Hochberg’s method for 
adjustment for multiple testing separately for the primary end points and secondary endpoints  will also 
be used .  
The last UPDRS, NMSS , and MD RS-[ADDRESS_335555] (LOCF) method, including clinical  score s on the 
discontinuation visit . Baseline values will not be carried forward. This methodology will be applied to 
all treatment groups ( liraglutide  and placebo).  
The assumptions of norm ality and homogeneity of variance will be explored using probability and 
residual plots. Data will be tested for normality using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test. If any of the assumptions 
are found to be violated, an appropriate transformation of the data or non -parametric test will be 
considered.  
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed on the PP population using the 
same methods described for the FAS population. Summaries of clinical  scores, including the change 
from baseline, will be presented at each visit (i.e. , baseline, Week 28, and Week 54). No adjustments 
have been made to the Type I error rate for the multiple comparisons of the primary or secondary 
endpoints since this is a phase II study; therefore , results should be interpreted appropriately.  No 
statistical testing within treatment groups will be performed.  
Inferential Statistics on Second ary Efficacy Parameter(s): Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints will 
be conducted on the FAS and PP populations. The following secondary e fficacy endpoints will be 
analyz ed using a n approach similar to that described for the primary efficacy endpoint s:  
• Change in PDQ -39 scores for each domain and total score between baseline and week 54.  
• Change in  Delis-Kaplan  Executive  Function  System  (DKEFS)  between baseline and week 
 
U1111 -1173 -0106                July 29, 2020 Page 13 
 54 
• Change in  Geriatric  Depression  Scale between baseline and week 54 
• Change in  Parkinson's  Anxiety  Scale scores between baseline and week 54 
 
The safety outcomes of this study will be the following:  
• Adverse event s 
• Serious adverse events   
• Clinical laboratory parameters  
• Geriatric  Depression  Scale  
• Vital signs  
• Physical examination.  
• 12-lead ECGs  
 
Interim Analysis : No interim efficacy analyses are planned for this study. However, after intervals 
during the study (for example, when approximately 25% of the subjects ( ca. 15 subjects) have been 
randomly assigned to the treatment groups  and again when  25%, 50%, 75% , and 100% of the planned 
number of subjects have reached 12 weeks of dosing ( week 1 4 visit)) the DSMB will conduct a review 
of safety data and will provide the Investigator  with recommendations regarding the conduct of the 
study. In particular, the DSMB will re view safety data (including thyroid and liver function,  serum 
amylase,  and fasting serum glucose  and insulin) when the first 25% of subjects have been enrolled and 
will make recommendations to the I nvestigator  as to whether or not there are any concerns which 
warrant discontinuation of enrol lment in any given treatment arm and/or the study overall.  
 
The DSMB will be composed of four members, selected  among clinicians and biostatisticians at Cedars 
Sinai Medical Center with expertise in Parkinson’s disease, glucose metabolism , pancreatitis  and current 
clinical trials conduct and methodology.  No member of the DSMB will have direct involvement in the 
conduct of the study. Fur thermore, no member will have financial, proprietary, professional, or other 
interests that may affect impartial, independent decision -making by [CONTACT_4318].  The research 
coordinator or other PI [INVESTIGATOR_274639] -related adverse events;  quality, completeness, and timeliness  of data 
collection;  adequacy of compliance with goals  for recruitment and retention; a dherence to the protocol  
and protocol violations . The DSMB will conclude each review with their recommendations to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_274640], be modified, or terminated. Recommendations 
regarding modification of the design and conduct of the study could include:  1) modifications of the 
study proto col based upon the review of the safety data;  2) suspension or early termination of the study 
because of serious concerns about subjects’ safety, inadequate performance or rate of enrollment.  
 
DATA /SAMPLE  HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]:  The Investigator  will delegate  
responsibility for  data entry  and quality to  a named  individual  who will be  part of the trial team,  in 
accordance  with the Data  Protection  Act of 1998.  The Investigator  will be responsible  for data analysis  
done independently  of data entry.  The Cedar s-Sinai  Core  Statistical  team  will be on hand  with 
additional  advic e. 
 
The plasma samples for EV analysis will be stored in the Advanced Health Sciences Pavillion building 
in a -80oC freezer.  
 
ETHICS:  The trial will comply with ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirements and proceed in 
 
U1111 -1173 -0106                July 29, 2020 Page 14 
 accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  Prior to the start of the study, the I nvestigator  will apply 
for approval  of the study from the Cedars -Sinai IRB. All docu ments required by [CONTACT_274661]. Any notification/submission must be dated and contain sufficient 
information to identify the relevant protocol. The study will only commence after receipt of written 
approval from th e Cedars -Sinai IRB. The I nvestigator  designee  is responsible for maintaining the 
approval documents in the Investigator study files. The I nvestigator  will report promptly to the IRB any 
new information that may adversely affect  the safety  of the patients o r the conduct of the trial. At the 
end of the study, the I nvestigator  is obligated to inform the IRB in writing that the study has ended and 
no further activities regarding this protocol will be conducted at the site  
 
STUDY SCHEDULE:  The trial will be conducted in the Neurology Department of the  Cedars -Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA, according to the following schedule of events.  Enrollment is 
expected to start (FPFV) on July 1st, 2016 and conclude (LPLV) on June 30th 2018.  
 
Screening  and information  visit 
The informed consent will take place after the study candidate  has received extensive oral and written 
information about the study, including the risks associated with the study procedures and study -drug, 
prior to any study -related activity, including screening procedures.  After  consenting,  detailed 
information will be collected on all study  candidates , including demographics  and relevant  medical  
history,  MDRS -2 screening, BDI-II screening, physical  and neurological  exam s, routine  vitals  (height, 
weight, blood pressure in clino - and orthostatic positions) , an EKG,  and blood and  urine  tests. For 
women  of child -bearing  age, a serum  pregnancy test  will also performed.   
 
Baseline  evaluati on visit 
After  confirmation  of eligibility  criteria,  subjects will subsequently be  randomized  to one of the two 
treatment  arms.  They  will then undergo  MDS-UPDRS  OFF and ON testing and  Neuropsychological  
testing  (ON) . The practically  defined  OFF condition  will be considered  an overnight withdrawal  of 
dopaminergic  medications  for 12 hours while ON evaluation  will be performed  1 hour (+ 15 minutes)  
after the administration  of the usual  morning  dose of dopaminergic medications.  The first daily  dose of 
0.6 mg and/or  placebo,  including  injection  instructions,  will be administered  at the end of the b aseline  
visit.  The baseline visit is to be conducted within 30 days of screening.  
 
Commence  treatmen t: 2-week  titration  
The following  two visits  will be dedicated  to medication  titration,  up to 1.2mg  (Week 1) and 1.8  mg 
(Week 2), as tolerated.  At every visit,  study  drug compliance  will be reviewed.  Adverse  events  will be 
assessed  and concomitant  medications,  routine  vitals,  and ECG, and blood  and urine  tests will be 
collected . A phone interview will be conducted following titration to determine which dosage (1.2  mg 
or 1.8  mg) the patient will remain on for the duration of the study.

Packaging and Labeling of Study Medications : Packaging and labe ling of the trial products will be 
handled by [CONTACT_3455] (Novo Nordisk A/S). Liraglutide and its vehicle will be administered via 
pens supplied by  [CONTACT_3455] (Novo Nordisk  A/S) . 
 
Storage and Drug Accountability of Study Medications : The research  pharmacist will inventory and 
acknowledge receipt of all shipments of the study drug. The study drug will be kept in a locked area 
with restricted access. The study drug will be stored in a refrigerator between 36ºF to 46ºF (2ºC to 8ºC), 
in a secu re location.  After initial use, the pen can be stored for 30 days at controlled room temperature 
(59°F to 86°F; 15°C to 30°C) or in a refrigerator (36°F to 46°F; 2°C to 8°C), with the pen cap on when 
not in use. The pen  should be always protected from excessive heat and sunlight.   
 
The PI, pharmacist, or designee is respo nsible for maintaining accurate records of  the receipt, 
dispensing, pr oper storage, and return of all investigational materials. Cedars Sinai Investigational Drug 
Pharmacy will be the designee  to control on -site storage conditions of the drug prior  to dispense. 
Temperature logs are maintained and archived indefinitely. At study closure, printed logs are provided 
in the pharmacy bind er for the duration of study drug storage.  The PI, pharmacist, or designee may 
dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the  study. Under no circumstance will the PI, 
pharmacist, or designee allow study drug  to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_760]. When a 
shipment is received, the research Pharmacist or designee  must verify the quantities received and return 
the acknowledgement to the Drug Manufacturer  or designee. The study drug accountability recor d 
includes the identification of the subject to  whom the drug is dispensed, the lot nu mber on the  pen, the 
date of dispensing, and any  returned or unused drug. An account must be given of any discrepancies. 
Thes e records must be readily  available for inspe ction by [CONTACT_274662].  The 
Investigational Drug Pharmacy will destroy unused drug following institutional drug destruction policy 
and will maintain a record of destruction of the drug incinerated off -site via the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s contracted 
pharmaceutical  waste vendor , Stericycle . 
 
Randomization and Blinding : The study drug will be administered according to the clinical study 
 
U1111 -[ADDRESS_335559] signed the informed consent form (ICF).  
 
At the end of the Baseline visit (see Study schedule) , each subject meeting entry criteria will be  
random ly assigned to one of the two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (liraglutide or placebo).  
A pre -determined randomization list generated by [CONTACT_274663]. Once assigned, codes will not be reused for any other subjects in the study. In data 
collection records, s ubjects  will be d esignated only by [CONTACT_274664] -identified codes. The randomization 
schedule  so generated will be maintained  by [CONTACT_274665] , who will remain the only 
unblinded study staff member .  
 
The liraglutide and matching placebo injection pens will be identical and  indistinguishable to the 
Investigator s, the subject s or others assisting in treatment administration . In accordance with the double -
blind design, all these individuals  will remain blinded to study treatment and will not have access to the 
randomization (treatment)  codes except under the circumstances described below.  
 
Breaking of Blinded Codes : The blinding code may be broken only in exceptional circumstances when 
knowledge of the study  drug is essential for treating the subject, such as in  case of an adverse event . 
Code breaking can be  performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_274641] a sealed 
envelope containing unblinding information provided by [CONTACT_274666] . The Investigator or the 
designee who breaks  the blind must record the date and the reasons for  doing so in the source 
documentation and in the subject's medical records  
 
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS:  See Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
 
 
ADVERSE EVENTS:  
Collection, Recording , and Reporting of Adverse Events  (AEs) : The collection of non -serious AE 
data and serious adverse event ( SAE ) information commences following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject 
administered an investigational product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding, for example ), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  (study drug). An 
Adverse Reaction (AR) is an AE for which a causal relationship to the trial product is at least possible , 
i.e. a causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.  
The description of each AE will identify the subject, date of onset, the date of resolution, the severity of 
the event, the action taken regarding study drug, the outcome o f the event, and the relationship of the 
event to study drug.  AE information will be entered in the CRF within 7 days of the information 
becoming available in order to ensure timely reporting to the Sponsor.  
Severity of reported AEs will be evaluated usin g the following guidelines:  
• Mild: The subject is aware of the AE but it is easily tolerated.  
• Moderate: The AE causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s activities of  daily life.  
 
U1111 -1173 -0106                July 29, 2020 Page 18 
 • Severe: The AE is debilitating or results in the inability of the subject to perform the  activities of daily 
life. 
 
The Investigator  will use  the following definitions to evaluate the relationship of each AE to the study 
drug:  
 
Definitely : An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug  
(including the course after withdrawal of the study drug) and that satisfies any of the  following:  
• reappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration (positive rechallenge);  
• toxic level of the study drug as evide nced by [CONTACT_274667].  
 
Probably Related : An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug  (including the course after withdrawal of the study drug) and for which involvement of  factors 
other than the study drugs, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant  drugs , and 
concurrent treatments, can reasonably be excluded. This may also include positive  dechallenge , in which 
the event abates upon discon tinuation of the study drug.  
 
Possibly Related : An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
drug  (including the course after withdrawal of the study drug) and for which possible  involvement of the 
study drug can be su ggested (for example , previous similar reports or  pharmacologic actions of the study 
drug) although factors other than the study drug,  such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant drugs , and concurrent treatments may  also be responsible.  
 
Unlike ly: An AE that, while not necessarily unrelated to the  study drug , does not appear to  follow a 
reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or that appears  to be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications,  concomitant drugs , and 
concurrent treatments.  
 
Not related : An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug  or that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases , complications, 
concomitant drugs , and concurrent treatments.  
 
The liraglutide US Prescribing Information document will be used for evaluations of expectedness, as 
agreed with the drug manufacturer.  
 
An SAE  is an experience that, at any dose, results in any of the following : 
• Death;  
• A life-threatening  event in which the patient is at risk of death at the time of the event . Note: i t does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274642];  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or 
female);   
• Need of  medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or 
permanent damage to a body structure ; 
 
U1111 -1173 -0106                July 29, 2020 Page 19 
 • An importa nt medical event: Those events that may not be immediately life -threatening  or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274643] s outcomes listed above.  
• Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_57657].  
 
A Serious adverse reaction (SAR) is an adverse event that fulfils both the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.  
 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a SAE that is unexpected and regarded 
as possibly or probably related to the trial/study product b y the investigator.  
SAEs require expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. Any SAE , SAR or S[LOCATION_003]R  
occurring in a clinical study subject will be reported to the  Institutional Review Board (IRB) within 10 
days of the Investigator having kno wledge of the SAE . In addition, the investigator will  copy Novo 
Nordisk A/S  (NN) when expediting SARs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs to health authorities  and will report all SARs 
related to NN Product to the local NN affiliate safety department. The submission to NN will be within 
day 15 from the investigator’s first knowledge about a valid case. The Investigator or other qualified 
individual at the investigative s ite will complete a n SAE form including study name, name [CONTACT_274673], subject identification  (e.g. subject number, initials, gender, age ), event (preferably diagnosis) , 
study drug, most  recent date of administration , the Investigator’s  causality assess ment to study drug  (as 
outlined above) and outcome .  
Follow -up of Adverse Events : If a subject experiences an SAE or AE, the subject will receive 
appropriate treatment and supportive care , as necessary, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_274644] -up until there 
is a return to the subject’s baseline condition, or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved.  
 
Pregnancy  Beginning During Course of Trial: Female study subjects will be advised by [CONTACT_274668] [ADDRESS_335560] (or partner) 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_335561] was  receiving study drug. Every attempt will be made to follow the 
pregnancy to concl usion to obtain information regarding the outcome . All pregnancies in trial subjects 
exposed to the study drug  will be reported to the drug manufacturer  (Novo Nordisk A/S) . 
 
Precautions/ Over-dosage : Based on previous studies with liraglutide  in patients with type -2 diabete s,76 
the following percentages of cases are expected to experience mild-to-moderate nausea ( 5-40%), 
diarrhea (17%), constipation (10%), and/or headache (9%). Subjects will be asked to report these or any 
other adverse effect s when they arise and during each of the scheduled visits (see Study Schedule).  
 
U1111 -[ADDRESS_335562] 's clinical signs and symptoms.  
 
LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:  A research -related  injury or illness is a direct result o f 
the study drug or a procedure performed only as a part of the study and is not part of standard clinical 
medical treatment. Cedars -Sinai has no plans to pay for costs associated with the treatment of research -
related injury or illness.   If a study subject  will need treatment  for a research -related  injury or illness, 
Cedars -Sinai Health System  will make every effort to seek reimbursement from his/her health plan . The 
subject will be responsible for any deductibles and co -payments required under his/h er health plan and 
for any claims ultimately denied by [CONTACT_274669].  Financial assistance may be available under Cedars -
Sinai’s Charity Care Policy and Procedure.  Losses such as lost wages will not be paid.  
 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF STUDY:  In case the  study is terminated early due to the 
discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk/safety concern, regardless of how far along 
the subject has reached in their study follow -up, subjects will be asked to return all unutilized pens to the 
PI.  The study site will then return investigational drug to the drug manufacturer (See also Study Drug 
Accountability).  
 
PUBLICATION PLANS:  The intention of the study will be to publish the results of the complete study 
at conclusion. All information obta ined during the conduct of this study will be regarded as confidential 
but no written permission from the study funding sources is required prior to disclosing any information 
relative to this study. A formal publication of data collected as a result of th e study will be considered a 
joint publication by [CONTACT_274670]. Authorship will be determined by 
[CONTACT_11402]. Submission to the funding source(s) for review and comment will be intended solely 
to ensure concurrence regar ding data, evaluations, and conclusions, and to provide an opportunity to 
share with the m any new or unpublished information of which they may be unaware.
